I use Ctrl+Enter and Ctrl+Shift+Enter to insert lines above and below
respectively in Visual Studio **all the time**. It drives me a bit bonkers
that the shortcuts are swapped in VSCode.
Given the name "Visual Studio Code" implies somewhat of a derivative of
"Visual Studio", could you please change the keyboard shortcuts for these two
commands to be consistent with Visual Studio?
