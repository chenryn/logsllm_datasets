### Who am I?
- Over 13 years of experience in the security field
- Worked with secure operating systems (B1, B2)
- Expertise in firewalls and proxies
- Trainer and educator
- Certified: CISSP, CISA
- Ham Radio operator
- Private Pilot
- Presented at DEF CON last year

### Is Flying Safe?
- **Is flying safe?** Yes.
- **Will planes fall out of the sky after this talk?** No.
- **Is flying safe after this talk?** Yes.
- **Is some of this talk illegal?** Maybe. **Disclaimer:** Do not attempt any of these actions!

---

### Pilots in the Audience
- Are there any pilots in the audience?

---

### Our Focus
- **Not focusing on:**
  - Airport physical security
  - Cockpit door security
  - X-Ray security
- **Our focus:**
  - Computers used by Air Traffic Control (ATC)
  - How airplanes report their position to ATC
  - NextGen ATC

---

### Why This Matters
- ATC is busy moving planes through the air
- ATC is not focused on the network security of the equipment being used
- Who would want to hack a radar scope?

---

### What is ATC?
- Air Traffic Control (ATC) manages the safe and orderly flow of air traffic.

---

### NextGen ATC
- Transitioning from proprietary hardware to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware
- Phasing out radar
- Airplanes' transponders will report latitude, longitude, and altitude in clear text
- Introduction of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)

---

### Airplane Transponder
- Source: Wikipedia

---

### ADS-B Insecurity
- **What does it mean?** One unencrypted packet contains who you are and where you are.
- **GPS as the backbone:** GPS satellites are failing faster than expected.
- **Potential for fake transmissions:** It is possible to easily fake an ADS-B transmission.
- **No radar verification:** There is no radar to verify the true position of the aircraft.

---

### More to Come
- Stay tuned for more information.

---

### Call to Action
- Listen to ATC communications
- View ADS-B broadcasts
- Consider becoming a pilot

---

### Conclusion
- Background on ATC
- State of airline security

---

### Questions
- Open floor for questions.
