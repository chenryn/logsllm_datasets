User: I am trying to run a python script from the Linux SSH Secure Shell command line environment, and I am trying to import the argparse library, but it gives the error: "ImportError: No module named argparse".
I think that this is because the Python environment that the Linux shell is using does not have the argparse library in it, and I think I can fix it fix it if I can find the directories for the libraries being used by the Python environment, and copy the argparse library into it, but I can not find where that directory is located.
I would appreciate any help on finding this directory (I suppose I could include the argparse library in the same directory as my python script for now, but I would much rather have the argparse library in the place where the other Python libraries are, as it should be).
Assistant: If you're on CentOS and don't have an easy RPM to get to Python 2.7, JF's suggestion of pip install argparse is the way to go.  Calling out this solution in a new answer.  Thanks, JF.
