MacOS supports multiple desktops. I show window when user taps on tray icon
and hide it when user clicks somewhere else. Is there any way to show window
on current desktop?
Using `setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces` makes window visible on all desktops but
calls to `window.show` still cause switch to the desktop where the window was
initially created/displayed.
I know I could re-create window each time, but that's slow. Would be awesome
to have a method like `BrowserWindow.showOnCurrentDesktop()` or something like
that. Not sure I can patch it externally without patching Electron/Atom.
  * Electron version: 1.6.0
  * Operating system: macOS Sierra
