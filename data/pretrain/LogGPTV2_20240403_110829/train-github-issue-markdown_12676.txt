Desire: make docs.flutter.io an excellent resource for learning how to use
Flutter.
Challenge: for some domains (e.g. Input) that do not have their own library
and cut across multiple libraries, we don't seem to have an easy way to author
holistic docs. We'd like a "starting point" for a concept, one that is easy to
identify when visiting docs.flutter.io.
Strawman proposal: something like a `@category` that can be used to link
various classes and libraries. We also need a way to say "this page is the
home page for a @category"
(I thought we had an issue open for this, but couldn't find it on either
https://github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc/issues or flutter.io/issues)
