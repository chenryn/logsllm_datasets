User: I am running two different Python scripts on a Ubuntu VPS. One of them is the production version, and the other one is for testing purposes.
From time to time, I need to kill or restart one of them. However ps does not show which script does each Python process runs.
What is the conventional way to do this?
Assistant: Easiest way to keep it simple would be to create a screen for each. screen -S prod and screen -S test, then run the python script in the background of each and detach the screen (using ctrl +a+d) then when you need to stop one screen -r prod then kill it/restart then detach again.
