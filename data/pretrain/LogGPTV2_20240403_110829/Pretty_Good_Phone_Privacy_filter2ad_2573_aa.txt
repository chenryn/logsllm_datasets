Abstract
To receive service in today’s cellular architecture, phones
uniquely identify themselves to towers and thus to operators.
This is now a cause of major privacy violations, as operators
sell and leak identity and location data of hundreds of millions
of mobile users.
In this paper, we take an end-to-end perspective on the
cellular architecture and ﬁnd key points of decoupling that
enable us to protect user identity and location privacy with
no changes to physical infrastructure, no added latency, and
no requirement of direct cooperation from existing operators.
In our architecture, we alter commonly attacked permanent
identiﬁers that are widely used in today’s mobile networks
to values that no longer individually identify users, while
maintaining connectivity and compatibility with existing in-
frastructure.
We describe Pretty Good Phone Privacy (PGPP) and
demonstrate how our modiﬁed backend stack (NGC) works
with real phones to provide ordinary yet privacy-preserving
connectivity. We explore inherent privacy and efﬁciency trade-
offs in a simulation of a large metropolitan region. We show
how PGPP maintains today’s control overheads while signiﬁ-
cantly improving user identity and location privacy.
1 Introduction
Cellular phone and data networks are an essential part of the
global communications infrastructure. In the United States,
there are 124 cellular subscriptions for every 100 people and
the total number of cellular subscriptions worldwide now
stands at over 8.2 billion [5]. Unfortunately, today’s cellular
architecture embeds privacy assumptions of a bygone era. In
decades past, providers were highly regulated and centralized,
few users had mobile devices, and data broker ecosystems
were undeveloped. As a result, except for law enforcement
access to phone records, user privacy was generally preserved.
Protocols that underpin cellular communication embed an
assumption of trusted hardware and infrastructure [2], and
speciﬁcations for cellular backend infrastructure contain few
formal prescriptions for preserving user data privacy. The
result is that the locations of all users are constantly tracked
as they simply carry a phone in their pocket, without even
using it.
Much has been made of privacy enhancements in recent
cellular standards (e.g., 5G), but such changes do nothing to
prevent cellular carriers from tracking user locations. Worse
still, the 5G push toward small cells results in much ﬁner-
grained location information, and thus tracking, than previous
generations.
Privacy violations by carriers.
In recent years it has been
extensively reported that mobile carriers have been routinely
selling and leaking mobile location data and call metadata of
hundreds of millions of users [18,19,40,71,75]. Unfortunately
for users, this behavior by the operators appears to have been
legal, and has left mobile users without a means of recourse
due to the conﬂuence of a deregulated industry, high mobile
use, and the proliferation of data brokers in the landscape. As
a result, in many countries every mobile user can be physically
located by anyone with a few dollars to spend. This privacy
loss is ongoing and is independent of leakage by apps that
users choose to install on their phones (which is a related but
orthogonal issue).
While this major privacy issue has long been present in the
architecture, the practical reality of the problem and lack of
technical countermeasures against bulk surveillance is beyond
what was known before. However there is a fundamental
technical challenge at the root of this problem: even if steps
were taken to limit the sale or disclosure of user data, such
as by passing legislation, the cellular architecture generally
and operators speciﬁcally would still seemingly need to know
where users are located in order to provide connectivity. Thus,
as things stand, users must trust that cellular network operators
will do the right thing with respect to privacy despite not
having done so to date.
Architectural, deployable solution. We identify points of
decoupling in the cellular architecture to protect user pri-

vacy in a way that is immediately deployable. In this, we
are aided by the industry-wide shift toward software-based
cellular cores. Whereas prior generations of cellular networks
ran on highly-speciﬁc hardware, many modern cellular core
functions are run in software, making it more amenable to
key changes.
In our approach, users are protected against location track-
ing, even by their own carrier. We decouple network con-
nectivity from authentication and billing, which allows the
carrier to run Next Generation Core (NGC) services that are
unaware of the identity or location of their users but while
still authenticating them for network use. Our architectural
change allows us to nullify the value of the user’s SUPI, an
often targeted identiﬁer in the cellular ecosystem, as a unique
identiﬁer1. We shift authentication and billing functionality
to outside of the cellular core and separate traditional cellular
credentials from credentials used to gain global connectivity.
Since it will take time for infrastructure and legislation to
change, our work is explicitly not clean slate. We anticipate
that our solution is most likely to be deployed by Mobile
Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), where the MVNO op-
erates the core (NGC) while the base stations (gNodeBs)
are operated by a Mobile Network Operator (MNO). This
presents us with architectural independence as the MVNO
can alter its core functionality, so long as the NGC conforms
to LTE / 5G standards. While it is not strictly necessary for
PGPP to be adopted by an MVNO, we assume that existing
industry players (e.g., MNOs) are unlikely to adopt new tech-
nologies or have an interest in preserving user privacy unless
legal remedies are instituted. As a result, we consider how
privacy can be added on top of today’s mobile infrastructure
by new industry entrants.
Contributions.
In this work we refactor the cellular core
in order to decouple billing and authentication functionality
from connectivity, allowing for enhanced privacy for com-
monly leveraged permanent identiﬁers (e.g., SUPIs). Our
main goal is to thwart bulk passive surveillance that is com-
monplace in today’s networks. Additionally, we create a mech-
anism for enhancing location privacy from local-scale targeted
attacks.
We describe our prototype implementation, Pretty Good
Phone Privacy (PGPP). In doing so, we examine several key
challenges in achieving privacy in today’s cell architecture.
In particular, we consider: 1) which personal identiﬁers are
stored and transmitted within the cellular infrastructure; 2)
which core network entities have visibility into them (and
how this can be mitigated); 3) which entities have the ability
to provide privacy and with what guarantees; and 4) how we
can provide privacy while maintaining compatibility with
today’s infrastructure and without requiring the cooperation
of established providers.
1The SUPI is the 5G equivalent for the well-known IMSI from previous
cellular generations.
Our prototype implements privacy-enhancing changes that
impact the control trafﬁc load of an operator. As such, we
show PGPP’s impact on control trafﬁc and on user anonymity.
We show that by altering the network coverage map we are
able to gain control trafﬁc headroom compared with today’s
networks; we then consume that headroom in exchange for
improved anonymity. We analyze the privacy improvements
against a variety of common cellular attacks, including those
based on bulk surveillance as well as targeted attacks. We ﬁnd
that PGPP signiﬁcantly increases anonymity where there is
none today. We ﬁnd that an example PGPP network is able to
increase the geographic area that an attacker could believe a
victim to be within by ~1,200% with little change in control
load.
Our contributions are as follows:
• We design a new architecture that decouples connectivity
from authentication and billing functionality, allowing
us to alter the identiﬁers used to gain connectivity (§4.1)
and enable PGPP-based operators to continue to authen-
ticate and bill users (§4.1) without identifying them.
• We adapt existing mechanisms to grow control trafﬁc
broadcast domains, thus enhancing user location privacy
while maintaining backwards compatibility (§4.2).
• We quantify the impacts of PGPP on both user privacy
and network control trafﬁc through simulation (§5) and
demonstrate PGPP’s feasibility in a lab testbed.
2 Background
Here we provide a brief overview of the cellular architec-
ture and describe the inherent privacy challenges. For sim-
plicity and brevity we focus on 5G, though the fundamental
challenges also exist in legacy standards.
2.1 Cellular architecture overview
The 5G architecture can be divided into two areas: the
Next Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN), which
is responsible for radio access; and the Next Generation Core
(NGC), which includes the entities responsible for authentica-
tion and connectivity to the network core. Figure 1 shows a
simpliﬁed architecture for both conventional cellular as well
as with PGPP. PGPP moves authentication and billing to a
new entity, the PGPP-GW, that is external to the NGC. We
detail PGPP’s speciﬁc changes in Section 4. We include a
glossary of cellular terms in Appendix A.
NG-RAN. The NG-RAN is the network that facilitates
connectivity between user devices (UEs)—commonly a cell
phone with a SIM card installed—and the serving base station
(gNodeB). The NG-RAN is responsible for providing UEs a
means of connecting to the NGC via gNodeBs.
NGC. The NGC is the core of the 5G cellular network and
includes entities that provide authentication, billing, voice,
SMS, and data connectivity. The NGC entities relevant to our

discussion are the Access and Mobility Management Func-
tion (AMF), the Authentication Server Function (AUSF), the
Session Management Function (SMF), and the User Plane
Function (UPF). The AMF is the main point of contact for
a UE and is responsible for orchestrating mobility and con-
nectivity. UEs authenticate to the network by sending an
identiﬁer that is stored in the SIM to the AMF. The AUSF is
then queried to verify that the UE is a valid subscriber. Once
the UE is authenticated, the AMF assigns the UE to an SMF
and UPF, which offer an IP address and connectivity to the
Internet. Note that 5G networks can include many copies of
these entities and contain many more entities; however, for
the purposes of our discussion this simpliﬁed model sufﬁces.
MVNOs. We design our solution to be implemented by
a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO). MVNOs are
virtual in that they offer cellular service without owning the
infrastructure itself. Rather, MVNOs pay to share capacity on
the infrastructure that an underlying carrier operates. MVNOs
can choose whether they wish to operate their own core en-
tities such as the AMF, AUSF, and UPF, which is the type
of operation we propose. MVNOs that run their own core
network are often called “full” MVNOs.
5G Network slicing. The 5G architecture includes the con-
cept of network slicing, whereby infrastructure is shared by
multiple, virtual networks that operate in isolation. Slicing en-
ables each virtual network to deﬁne its requirements in terms
of performance (e.g., latency demands, bandwidth, etc.). Net-
work slicing, along with the industry shift toward “whitebox”
gNodeBs that connect to central ofﬁces that act as datacenters
with virtualized NGC services, as in the Open Networking
Foundation’s M-CORD project [26], lowers the barrier to en-
try for our PGPP architectural changes. Other recent work has
shown that dramatic architectural changes are now possible
as the cellular core functionality is increasingly implemented
as software components rather than through specialized hard-
ware, enabling signiﬁcant performance gains [58, 59].
Table 1: User identiﬁers in 5G.
2.2 Privacy in the cellular architecture
Maintaining user privacy is challenging in cellular net-
works, both past and present as it is not a primary goal of
the architecture. In order to authenticate users for access and
billing purposes, networks use globally unique client identi-
ﬁers. Likewise, the cellular infrastructure itself must always
“know” the location of a user in order to minimize latency
when providing connectivity. We brieﬂy discuss cellular iden-
tiﬁers as well as location information available from the per-
spective of the cell network in this section. We use acronyms
from the 5G architecture as it is the newest standard; however,
similar entities exist in all generations (2G, 3G, 4G LTE).
User and device identiﬁers. There are multiple identiﬁers
that can be used to associate network usage with a given
subscriber. Identiﬁers can be assigned by various actors in the
ecosystem, they can vary in degree of permanence, and they
can be globally unique across all cellular operators or they
can be locally unique within a given network. Table 1 shows
these identiﬁers, their allocators, and their permanence in 5G.
The Subscription Permanent Identiﬁer (SUPI) is the iden-
tiﬁer used to gain access to the network when a phone (UE)
performs initial attachment. The SUPI is globally unique, per-
manent, and is stored on the SIM card. Carriers maintain a
AUSF database containing the list of SUPIs that are provi-
sioned for use on the network and subscription details for
each. Because the SUPI is globally unique and permanent, it
is seen as a high-value target for those who wish to surveil
cellular users. For example, in recent years there has been
a rise of cell-site simulators, also known as IMSI catchers2.
These devices offer what appears to be a legitimate base sta-
tion (gNodeB) signal. Since UE baseband radios are naïve
and automatically connect to the strongest signal, they will at-
tempt to attach to the IMSI catcher and offer their IMSI. IMSI
catchers have been used extensively by law enforcement as
well as nation-state adversaries to identify and eavesdrop on
cellular users [54].
2The SUPI is a replacement for the International Mobile Subscriber
Identity (IMSI) from previous cellular generations. The SUPI and IMSI
have equivalent functionality. In 5G networks, the SUPI is encrypted before
transmission, creating a Subscription Concealed Identiﬁer (SUCI). However,
