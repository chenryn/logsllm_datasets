Abstract—Honeypot-based spammer gathering solutions usu-
ally lack attribute variability, deployment ﬂexibility, and net-
work scalability, deemed as their common drawbacks. This
paper explores pseudo-honeypot, a novel honeypot-like system
to overcome such drawbacks, for efﬁcient and scalable spammer
snifﬁng. The pseudo-honeypot takes advantage of user diversity
and selects normal accounts, with attributes that have the higher
potential of attracting spammers, as the parasitic bodies. By
harnessing such category of users, pseudo-honeypot can monitor
their streaming posts and behavioral patterns transparently.
When compared with its traditional honeypot counterpart, the
proposed solution offers the substantial advantages of attribute
variability, deployment ﬂexibility, network scalability, and system
portability. Meanwhile, it offers a novel method to collect the
social network dataset that has a higher probability of includ-
ing spams and spammers, without being noticed by advanced
spammers. We take the Twitter social network as an example
to exhibit its system design, including pseudo-honeypot nodes
selection, monitoring, feature extraction, ground truth label-
ing, and learning-based classiﬁcation. Through experiments, we
demonstrate the efﬁciency of pseudo-honeypot in terms of spams
and spammers gathering. In particular, we conﬁrm our solution
can garner spammers at least 19 times faster than the state-of-
the-art honeypot-based counterpart.
I. INTRODUCTION
The popularity of online social networks, such as Twitter,
Facebook, and Instagram, has made them indispensable in our
daily life. The success of online social networks not only
has provided advanced tools for users to chat with friends,
keep in touch with family, and share news, but also has the
potentials of bringing economic proﬁt and political inﬂuence.
For example, in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter
offered the largest source of breaking news with around 40
million election-related tweets [14]. Such amount of news has
widely inﬂuenced voters’ opinions to some extent.
However, spammers have been the adversaries since the
inception of online social networks, pervasively annoying
users. By creating fake accounts or compromising benign
ones, spammers can initialize social relationships and send
unsolicited requests or messages. Such requests or messages,
containing malware URLs, phishing or deception information,
can spread the harm to victims. The frequent appearance
of these harms has adversely impacted the quality of users’
experience, stolen private information, caused economic loss,
and possibly changed victims’ political opinions. In particular,
a report [31] shows that the spam messages in Twitter have
changed public opinions resulting from some 1.4 million
To date, there has been extensive research [1], [7], [24], [18],
[12], [21], [8], [29] on exploiting effective mechanisms to cap-
ture spammers. These mechanisms focus either on classifying
the spam messages from large-scale network contents or ana-
lyzing the social relationships to identify fake/compromised
accounts. Also,
the graph-based approaches and statistical
models [4], [35], [15], [3], [10] are employed to analyze the
social relationships among a large number of accounts with
the aim to identify the anomaly accounts as fake or compro-
mised ones. Obviously, these efforts are time-consuming and
inefﬁcient since they ﬁlter spams (or spammers) from a large
set of network contents (or accounts), but can only detect a
small portion of spammers.
On the other hand,
the honeypot was introduced as a
promising solution by manually creating accounts as lures for
spammers [27], [16], [22], [17], [38]. By imitating as a normal
account with some speciﬁc attributes that suit spammers’
tastes, a social honeypot can stay in the social network with
an intent to attract spammers. Although honeypot can trap
spammer accounts and only need to process on a small set of
data, it suffers from major drawbacks, including deployment
ﬂexibility, attribute variability, and network scalability. The
rationale behind is the manual setup which involves consider-
able human efforts. Thus, it incurs heavy deployment overhead
and is impractical to scale up in a large-sized network to trap
spammers. Moreover, even the honeypot acts as an ordinary
account, it is still possible to be recognized by spammers with
the evolution of smart spam techniques.
In this paper, we propose a novel spammer gathering and
detection system, called pseudo-honeypot, by taking advan-
tage of the diversity of online social users and utilizing it
as the key resources to trap spammers. Instead of creating
artiﬁcial accounts, we allow the pseudo-honeypot to take a
normal user as the parasitic body and harness such a user
to monitor spam activities. In particular, the pseudo-honeypot
nodes are selected from a pool of normal users that are more
vulnerable to spammers. From this point of view, pseudo-
honeypot is envisioned to perform the similar function as
honeypot in attracting and trapping spammers but has much
rich diversity in user attributes. By harnessing normal users,
the pseudo-honeypot can monitor the streaming posts and
behavior patterns that have a higher probability of including
spam messages. Furthermore, such pseudo-honeypot system

can be easily scaled to the large size of networks for spammer
capture by harnessing more users. As a result, it can be readily
understood that the proposed pseudo-honeypot system offers
the advantages of attribute variability, deployment ﬂexibility,
and network scalability, which will be further discussed in
Section II.
To concretize our discussion, we take Twitter social network
as an example to illustrate the design of pseudo-honeypot
and show its advantages on spammers capturing. By carefully
identifying a set of attributes that have high potentials in
attracting spammers, we select the accounts that possess such
attributes to serve as pseudo-honeypot nodes. Twitter’s API en-
ables us to select suitable pseudo-honeypot nodes periodically
and to monitor the selected accounts transparently. It should
be noted that
the employed Twitter APIs (i.e., Streaming
API and Restful) monitor only public information and the
Twitter API’s privacy policy terms are strictly followed by our
pseudo-honeypot system. To classify spams/spammers from
the monitored data with high accuracy, we design a pseudo-
honeypot detector by employing a machine learning-based
approach, which requires a ground truth dataset for training.
To produce the quality training dataset, we ﬁrst extract a
rich set of features that can reﬂect spammer’s characteristics.
Then, we use diversiﬁed methods (i.e., checking suspended
accounts, clustering, and the rule-based method) to pre-process
a raw dataset so as to generate a roughly labeled one and
then perform manual checking to reﬁne it
into a reliable
ground truth dataset for training. In the end, we equip the
machine learning algorithms in our detector to classify the
collected tweets. To validate the performance of our system,
we periodically create one pseudo-honeypot network with
2, 400 nodes in each hour and conduct experiments for a total
of 700 hours.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
• We propose a novel spammer gathering framework,
named pseudo-honeypot, for social networks. This frame-
work systematically differs from the honeypot, as it takes
advantage of the existing environment and offers the
substantial advantages of attribute variability, deployment
ﬂexibility, network scalability, and system portability.
• We present the system design of the pseudo-honeypot
in Twitter social networks and show its signiﬁcant per-
formance improvement on spammer capturing and better
scalability by doing away with the manual setup for hon-
eypot construction while enriching its attributes diversity.
• We implement the pseudo-honeypot system and conduct
experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. During a
700-hour experiment, we collect 5, 618, 476 tweets posted
by 2, 785, 815 unique users, in which we classify a total
of 1, 208, 375 spams and 50, 966 spammers.
• We show the effectiveness of prevalent attributes and re-
ﬁne the top 10 most likely attributes that attract spammers
for use to create an advanced pseudo-honeypot system.
The experimental results show that such an advanced
pseudo-honeypot system can garner spammers at least 19
times faster than the prominent honeypot systems.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we discuss our problem and propose the pseudo-
honeypot as a novel framework for spammer gathering in
online social networks. In Section III, we take Twitter social
network as an example to present the system design of pseudo-
honeypot. Section IV presents our pseudo-honeypot spam
detector design,
including feature extraction, ground truth
labeling, and machine learning-oriented classiﬁcation. Based
on this design, we present the system implementation and use
experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed system in Section V. Section VI discusses related
work and Section VII concludes this paper.
II. PSEUDO HONEYPOT OVERVIEW
In this paper, we study the spams collection and detection
problem in online social networks. Our goal is to develop an
efﬁcient and effective mechanism to monitor the online social
network contents that are likely to include spam messages
and then identify them so as to remove them. We propose
a novel system, named pseudo-honeypot, to achieve this goal.
By taking advantage of user diversity, our pseudo-honeypot is
constructed on top of normal users that may suffer spammy
behaviors. These users are selected with attributes that meet
spammer’s tastes,
thus likely to attract spammers. Instead
of artiﬁcially creating fake accounts, pseudo-honeypot can
still perform the similar function as honeypot in spammer
attraction. Although the pseudo-honeypot takes normal users
as its carrier, it can be constructed not to affect normal users’
activities nor to make any change to their posts or behavioral
patterns so as to meet the social network privacy policy. Thus,
it is invisible to normal users and cannot be recognized by
spammers. By harnessing these accounts, pseudo-honeypot can
monitor streaming posts and behavioral patterns in a real-time
manner. With monitored data, we can design suitable spam
detector by extracting features that reﬂect spammer’s charac-
teristics and leveraging machine learning-based approaches for
classiﬁcation.
The pseudo-honeypot framework possesses salient advan-
tages, as follows.
• Nodes availability. By taking normal user accounts as
the parasitic body, pseudo-honeypot has a large number
of available candidates in a social network. The involved
construction cost is trivial when compared to placing the
artiﬁcial honeypots. Meanwhile, in case some pseudo-
honeypot nodes fail (i.e., accounts become dead or lose
spammer’s interests), our system can quickly select other
candidates to serve as new pseudo-honeypot nodes. Thus,
this approach provides abundant node availability with a
small creation cost.
• Deployment ﬂexibility.
Its deployment ﬂexibility man-
ifests two aspects: candidates and attributes. From the
candidate selection perspective, the pseudo-honeypot has
the ﬂexibility of switching its parasitic bodies among
candidates in social networks. Such ﬂexibility is critical to
make the pseudo-honeypot always involving accounts that
are attractive of spammers’ interests. From the attribute

meet spammers’ interests. In this step, there are a number of
technical challenges that one must address.
• Transparent to normal users. Since pseudo-honeypot
takes normal user accounts as the parasitic body, one key
criterion is that pseudo-honeypot’s activities have to be
utterly transparent to users so as to observe Twitter’s se-
curity and privacy policy. In sharp contrast, the honeypot
relies on the operators to have the privilege to access
and manage target user accounts, whose activities may
be visible to affected accounts. It is a big challenge in
the design of pseudo-honeypot to meet such transparency
criterion.
• Pseudo-honeypot selection. There are billions of user
accounts in the Twitter social network, but not all of
them are suitable to serve as the pseudo-honeypot nodes.
Carefully and strictly screening user accounts is required
in order to keep high efﬁciency in spammer capturing.
The attributes are key to guide our selection of pseudo-
honeypot nodes. That
the type of user
accounts that possess similar attributes as those of the
honeypot so that
those target users are highly likely
to attract spammers. Unfortunately, the wide variety of
attributes from billions of users provides a rich attribute
set but also comes with difﬁculties in determining the
top ones that best meet spammers’ tastes. Therefore,
how to extract the suitable attributes and select accounts
which possess them from billions of Twitter users, are
challenging.
is, we target
• Pseudo-honeypot portability.
Since there is a large
pool of available Twitter accounts, it is essential to let
the pseudo-honeypot shift across accounts dynamically.
Such portability allows pseudo-honeypot to smartly drop
the ineffective ones, always keeping those that attract
spammers’ interests the most. This is in contrast to the
static, passive, and immutable properties of the honeypot
while exhibiting improved spammer capturing efﬁciency.
But the implementation of such a dynamical property
raises the issue of deciding the lifetime of each pseudo-
honeypot node. Due to the variety of user account activi-
ties, it is extremely challenging in deciding when to shift
to new accounts.
B. Attribute-based Pseudo-honeypot Selection
In order
to select
the effective attributes for pseudo-
honeypot, we take the reverse engineering strategy. That is,
we ﬁrst take a large pool of prevalent attributes that have been
widely used in previous research and then use them as the
criteria to select pseudo-honeypot nodes for creating a sample
pseudo-honeypot system. After running it for a period, we
will examine these attributes and reﬁne the top ones that have
the highest probability of capturing spammers. These reﬁned
attributes will govern our design of a highly effective pseudo-
honeypot system. As the account screening is extremely fast
(to be shown in Section V), pseudo-honeypot makes it easy
to select any sized attributes pool in the design. Here, we
just take into account the prevalent attributes from [34], [37],

selection perspective, the normal users provide a large
variety of attributes for attracting spammers. This en-
ables pseudo-honeypots to ﬂexibly update their desirable
attributes without manual construction.
• Attributes variability. The normal users offer abundant
varieties of attributes that can be well utilized by pseudo-
honeypots. Instead of manually setting up attributes in a
honeypot, our framework can select desirable ones within
existing attributes quickly and automatically so as to
reduce the deployment cost. Moreover, some honeypot
attributes are difﬁcult, if not impossible, to manually set
up in a short time, such as a long account age (e.g., 3
years) and plentiful friends/followers.
• Network scalability. The manual operations (of creating
artiﬁcial accounts and conﬁguring attributes) in a hon-
eypot system are prohibitively involved in establishing a
large-scale honeypot network. However, pseudo-honeypot
can directly select the desired attributes and associate
normal users with them. This avoids signiﬁcant manual
setup overhead, thus permitting to generate an arbitrarily
sized pseudo-honeypot network.
Our pseudo-honeypot offers many possibilities and potential
beneﬁts to capture spammers in a social network. To be
