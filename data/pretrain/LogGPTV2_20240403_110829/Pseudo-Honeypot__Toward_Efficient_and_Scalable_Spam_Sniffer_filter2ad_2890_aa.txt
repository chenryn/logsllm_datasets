## Abstract
Honeypot-based spammer detection systems often suffer from limited attribute variability, deployment inflexibility, and poor network scalability. This paper introduces the pseudo-honeypot, a novel system designed to overcome these limitations, enabling efficient and scalable spammer detection. The pseudo-honeypot leverages user diversity by selecting normal accounts with attributes that are likely to attract spammers. By monitoring the streaming posts and behavioral patterns of these users, the pseudo-honeypot can detect spammers without being noticed by advanced spammers. Compared to traditional honeypots, our solution offers significant advantages in attribute variability, deployment flexibility, network scalability, and system portability. We use Twitter as a case study to demonstrate the system design, including node selection, monitoring, feature extraction, ground truth labeling, and learning-based classification. Our experiments show that the pseudo-honeypot can gather spammers at least 19 times faster than state-of-the-art honeypot-based methods.

## 1. Introduction
The widespread use of online social networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram has made them integral to daily life. These platforms not only facilitate communication and information sharing but also have the potential to influence economic and political landscapes. For instance, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter was a major source of breaking news, with around 40 million election-related tweets [14], significantly impacting voter opinions.

However, spammers have been a persistent threat, using fake or compromised accounts to send unsolicited messages containing malware, phishing, or deceptive information. This has led to a decline in user experience, theft of private information, economic losses, and even manipulation of political opinions. A report [31] indicates that spam messages on Twitter influenced public opinion, affecting 1.4 million users.

Extensive research [1, 7, 24, 18, 12, 21, 8, 29] has focused on developing effective mechanisms to detect spammers, either by classifying spam messages or analyzing social relationships to identify fake or compromised accounts. Graph-based approaches and statistical models [4, 35, 15, 3, 10] have also been used to analyze social relationships and identify anomalous accounts. However, these methods are often time-consuming and inefficient, as they filter through large datasets but only detect a small portion of spammers.

In contrast, honeypots, which involve creating artificial accounts to lure spammers, have shown promise [27, 16, 22, 17, 38]. While honeypots can effectively trap spammers, they suffer from deployment inflexibility, limited attribute variability, and poor network scalability due to the manual setup required.

This paper proposes the pseudo-honeypot, a new spammer detection system that leverages the diversity of online social users. Instead of creating artificial accounts, the pseudo-honeypot selects normal users with attributes that are attractive to spammers. By monitoring these users' activities, the pseudo-honeypot can detect spammers more efficiently and scalably. Our system is designed to be transparent to normal users, adhering to privacy policies, and can be easily scaled to large networks.

## 2. System Design
### 2.1 Overview
The pseudo-honeypot system is designed to address the limitations of traditional honeypots by leveraging the diversity of normal users. The system selects normal accounts with attributes that are likely to attract spammers and monitors their activities. This approach provides several advantages:

- **Nodes Availability:** The pseudo-honeypot can select from a large pool of normal users, reducing the cost and effort required for deployment.
- **Deployment Flexibility:** The system can dynamically switch between different normal users, ensuring that it always targets accounts that are attractive to spammers.
- **Transparent to Normal Users:** The pseudo-honeypot operates transparently, adhering to privacy policies and not affecting normal user activities.
- **Attribute Variability:** The system can quickly and automatically select desirable attributes from the existing pool of normal users, reducing manual setup overhead.
- **Network Scalability:** The pseudo-honeypot can be easily scaled to large networks without significant manual setup.

### 2.2 Pseudo-Honeypot Selection
To select effective attributes for the pseudo-honeypot, we use a reverse engineering strategy. We start with a large pool of prevalent attributes and use them to create a sample pseudo-honeypot system. After running the system, we refine the top attributes that are most effective in capturing spammers. These refined attributes guide the design of a highly effective pseudo-honeypot system.

### 2.3 System Implementation
We implement the pseudo-honeypot system using Twitter as a case study. We use Twitter's API to select suitable pseudo-honeypot nodes and monitor their activities. The system includes a spam detector that uses machine learning to classify spams and spammers. To train the detector, we extract features that reflect spammer characteristics and preprocess the data to generate a reliable ground truth dataset.

### 2.4 Experimental Results
We conduct experiments over 700 hours, periodically creating a pseudo-honeypot network with 2,400 nodes. During this period, we collect 5,618,476 tweets from 2,785,815 unique users, classifying a total of 1,208,375 spams and 50,966 spammers. Our results show that the pseudo-honeypot can capture spammers at least 19 times faster than traditional honeypot systems.

## 3. Conclusion
The pseudo-honeypot is a novel and effective system for detecting spammers in online social networks. By leveraging the diversity of normal users, the pseudo-honeypot offers significant advantages in attribute variability, deployment flexibility, and network scalability. Our experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in capturing spammers, making it a promising solution for combating spam in large-scale social networks.
