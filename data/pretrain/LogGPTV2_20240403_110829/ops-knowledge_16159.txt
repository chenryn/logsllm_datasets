User: I currently have a working python application, gui with wxpython. I send this application a folder which then gets processed by a command line application via Popen. Each time I run this application it take about 40 mins+ to process before it finishes. While a single job processes I would like to queue up another job, I don't want to submit multiple jobs at the same time, I want to submit one job, while it's processing I want to submit another job, so when the first one finishes it would then just process the next, and so on, but I am unsure of how to go about this and would appreciate some suggestions.
Assistant: Presumably you have either a notification that the task has finished being passed back to the GUI or the GUI is checking the state of the task periodically.  In either case you can allow the user to just add to a list of directories to be processed and when your popen task has finished take the first one off of the list and start a new popen task, (remembering to remove the started one off of the list.
