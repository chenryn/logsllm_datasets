Claim 11. Suppose there exists a PPT adversary A such that AdvHybrid2[j−1]
Then the advantage of A in distinguishing the output of G is at least .
Proof. Simulator B receives point x = b1 . . . bv from A. B sets yi,0
$← {0, 1}λ, yi,⊥ $← {0, 1}λ, FK,i ←
yi,0, FK,i,⊥ ← yi,⊥ : i  v + 1 − j. B is given z = yv+1−j,0(cid:107)yv+1−j,1(cid:107)yv+1−j,⊥ as input which is ei-
ther the output of G on a random λ-bit input, or is a truly random 3λ-bit string. B sets FK,i ←
(Gbi−1 . . . (yv+1−j,1) . . .), FK,i,⊥ ← G⊥(Gbi( . . . (yv+1−j,⊥) . . . )) : i ∈ [v + 1 − j, v − 1]. B sets
Gbi
(Gbv−1( . . . (yv+1−j,1) . . . )), FK,v+1,0 ← G0(Gbv( . . . (yv+1−j,1) . . . )), FK,v+1,1 ← G1(Gbv(
FK,v ← Gbv
. . . (yv+1−j,1) . . . )). B sends K{x} and G⊥(Gbv( . . . (yv+1−j,1) . . . )). If B is given G(yv−j,1) for random
yv−j,1 then it is in Hybrid 2[j −1], otherwise if z is truly random, it is in Hybrid 2[j]. The claims follows.

Observe that Hybrid 1 is identical to Hybrid 2[0]. Similiarly Hybrid 4[v + 1] is identical to Hybrid 5.
Thus claims 8 - 11 imply that the advantage of any PPT adversary in distinguishing Hybrids 1 and 5 is at
most 2(v + 1)· P RG, where P RG is the maximal distinguishing adversary of any adversary in distinguishing
the output of the PRG. On the other hand, any adversary distinguishing Hybrids 1 and 5 distinguishes the
output of the puncturable PRF. Since P RG is negligible by assumption, it follows that no adversary has
more than a negligible advantage in distinguishing the output of the puncturable PRF.
