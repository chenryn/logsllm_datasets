Hi everyone.
This issue is following #6950  
The fix works on IE11. Unfortunately, it doesn't under Edge.
It seems that Edge is implementing innerHTML property on SVG tag, but in an
inefficient way. Using it appends SVG text in the DOM tree, as it can be seen
using the inspector, but Edge doesn't render anything... Unless you modify the
svg string in the inspector...
See the codepen (updated to use React 15.3) under Edge to see that issue.
Of course, if we enforce Edge to use the hack, it works. I don't know how to
enforce it except browser sniffing (grr...).
