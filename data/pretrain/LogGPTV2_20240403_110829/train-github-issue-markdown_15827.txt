Hello everyone,

This issue is a follow-up to #6950. The fix works correctly in Internet Explorer 11, but unfortunately, it does not function as expected in Microsoft Edge.

It appears that Edge implements the `innerHTML` property for SVG tags, but does so in an inefficient manner. When using `innerHTML` to set SVG content, the text is appended to the DOM tree, which can be verified using the browser's developer tools. However, Edge fails to render the SVG content properly. Interestingly, if you modify the SVG string directly in the inspector, the rendering issue is resolved.

You can observe this problem by viewing the [updated CodePen](#) (now using React 15.3) in Edge.

One possible workaround is to enforce the use of a specific hack for Edge, which does resolve the issue. However, this would require browser sniffing, which is generally not recommended due to its potential unreliability and maintenance overhead.

Thank you for your attention, and I welcome any suggestions or insights on how to address this problem more effectively.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
