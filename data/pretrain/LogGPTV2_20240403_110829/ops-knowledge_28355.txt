### Issue with `pip` on AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux, Python 2.7.10)

**Environment:**
- Server: AWS EC2
- OS: Amazon Linux
- Python Version: 2.7.10

When I run the following command, it works as expected:

```bash
$ pip --version
pip 7.1.2 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
```

However, when I use `sudo`, I encounter an error:

```bash
$ sudo pip --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 3020, in <module>
    working_set = WorkingSet._build_master()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 616, in _build_master
    return cls._build_from_requirements(__requires__)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 629, in _build_from_requirements
    dists = ws.resolve(reqs, Environment())
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 807, in resolve
    raise DistributionNotFound(req)
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: pip==6.1.1
```

### Solution

I encountered the same issue and resolved it by following these steps:

1. **Locate the `pip` executable:**

   ```bash
   $ sudo which pip
   ```

2. **Edit the `pip` script:**

   ```bash
   $ sudo vim /usr/bin/pip
   ```

3. **Modify the `pip` version:**

   Change any instances of `pip==6.1.1` to the version you have upgraded to, such as `pip==8.1.2`.

This solution worked for me.
