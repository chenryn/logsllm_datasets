### What problem does this feature solve?
One guy finded, that computed getter may use with arrow function and
destructed variables/methods.
I went ahead, and appended this case to `set()`, but failed, because setter
not called component.  
Later, i tried use `arguments`: `(locale =>
arguments[1].a.methods.updateLocale(locale))`, but vuex can't use `dispatch`
to this, because undefined.
I think this API looks nice and will reduce many new lines :D
### What does the proposed API look like?
    export default {
      computed: {
        ...mapGetters(['global']),
        locale: {
          get: ({ global }) => global.locale,
          set: (locale, { updateLocale }) => updateLocale(locale)
        }
      },
      methods: {
        ...mapActions(['updateLocale'])
      }
    }
