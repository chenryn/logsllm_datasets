User: Please describe the difference between Docker containers and traditional virtual machines and provide appropriate application scenarios.
Assistant: The main difference between Docker containers and traditional virtual machines is the granularity of virtualization. Traditional virtual machines virtualize the entire operating system, while Docker containers virtualize applications and their dependent libraries and services. Specifically, Docker containers share the kernel of the host operating system, compared to traditional virtual machines that require a full operating system to run inside each virtual machine. This means that Docker containers require fewer resources and have faster startup times, but it also means that Docker containers cannot run incompatible operating systems or kernels. Due to the lightweight and fast startup of Docker containers, it is suitable for some rapid iterative deployment scenarios, such as during development and testing, and in cloud computing, containerization, and microservice environments. Traditional virtual machines are more suitable for scenarios that require certain isolation and security, such as application deployment in insurance, finance, and medical fields.
