User: I recently made an executable of a Python program with py2exe, and when I ran the executable, a command window appeared for a split second and then disappeared. My program itself never actually ran at all. Everything is still inside the dist folder, so I'm not sure what's actually wrong. Is there a solution for this?
Assistant: If all your program does is print something and you run it by double-clicking the executable, then it simply closes the console when it finishes running. If you want the window to stay open, run your program from the command line. You can also create a batch file that runs your program and then pauses the console, so that you at least get a "press any key" before the console closes.
