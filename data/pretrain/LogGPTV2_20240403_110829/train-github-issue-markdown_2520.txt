**Migrated Issue, Originally Created by Anonymous**

When a `SELECT` statement is evaluated directly, it functions correctly. However, when the same `SELECT` statement is nested within a query using the `in_` function, and involves highly interconnected tables with joined table inheritance, the `FROM` clause element is repeated. This repetition is sufficient to cause most databases to fail in executing the command.

For a detailed example, please refer to the attached code: **bug_test.py**.
