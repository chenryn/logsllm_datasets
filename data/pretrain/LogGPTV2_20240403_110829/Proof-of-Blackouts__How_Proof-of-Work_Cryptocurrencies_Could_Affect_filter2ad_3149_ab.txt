shedding or shutdown of power plants.
In order to cause such an incident, the adversary requires the possibility of
instantly forcing a high number of miners into idling. We therefore assume a
central instance as depicted in Fig. 1(a). This central instance is able to directly
or indirectly inﬂuence miners which might appear artiﬁcial at ﬁrst. However, in
the past, cryptocurrencies have already experienced comparable situations, as
emphasized in the following enumeration: (1) Antbleed 5 included a backdoor in
the Antminer mining hardware that allowed the vendor to remotely shutdown
devices. Its exploitation could have caused an estimated outage of up to 70% of
all mining equipment in the Bitcoin network. (2) In September 2016, Ethereum
experienced an outage of lots of nodes due to a bug in the centrally maintained
software6. The software as a central instance indirectly (and unintentionally) told
the miners to stop mining by software malfunction, leading to a sharp decrease
in hash rate of over 10%. (3) Mining is typically performed in mining pools,
i.e., miners jointly aim to create the next block in order to reduce variance and
maximize revenue. Therefore, miners are connected to a central server or cen-
trally managed infrastructure that forwards them their share of hashing puzzles.
Malfunction or hostile takeover of the server and/or its communication – the
de-facto standard is the Stratum protocol [27] – bears potential to take control
over the hash rate of all miners in the pool. It has been already conﬁrmed that
ﬂuctuations in consumption caused by botnets are able to trigger large frequency
shifts and eventually load shedding and shutdown of power plants [7]. In this
paper, we investigate whether Bitcoin or Ethereum is able to cause such large
deviations threating reliable operation of the power grid.

4 Assessment of Models for Power Consumption
In a ﬁrst step, we need an estimation of the total power consumption of the
respective cryptocurrencies. Multiple models – both from the world of academia
as well as beyond – are available; however, they signiﬁcantly diﬀer with regard
to their underlying assumptions, not to mention their ﬁnal outcome on total
power consumption. In addition, they mainly focus on Bitcoin. In the following
paragraphs, we assess these models and their parameters with respect to the
quality of the results. Finally, we decide for a model that is built upon within
the remainder of this work.
– O’Dwyer and Malone [23] calculate an upper and lower bound for worldwide
Bitcoin energy consumption based on the network’s hash rate and consump-
tion values of commodity hardware and specialized mining hardware. The
authors did not aim to model the actual mix of mining hardware, and they
could only conclude that the consumption lies between the calculated upper
and lower bound.
– Vranken [32] calculated power consumption under the assumption that all
Bitcoin mining is done on (i) CPUs, (ii) GPUs, (iii) FPGAs or (iv) ASICs
before bounding power consumption by means of (a) the total world power
production, (b) assuming that the total mining revenue is spent on electric
power, and ﬁnally the (c) inclusion of acquisition costs. As O’Dwyer and
Malone, there has been no eﬀort to model the actual hardware mix of the
mining network.
– Deetman [8] aimed to overcome the above drawback by modeling the hard-
ware mix of the mining network in a more sophisticated way. First, the author
inferred the decrease of power consumption per hashing operation over time
based on mining hardware’s speciﬁcation and its release data. In a second
step, the increase of hash rate per month has been attributed to newest hard-
ware (that is then assumed to run three to ﬁve years before being removed
from the mining network again), then, ﬁnally leading to the average power
consumption of the respective hardware mix. By means of the hash rate, the
total power consumption was calculated.
– The Vries [33] follows a ﬁnancially-oriented approach assuming that a certain
ratio of the network’s mining revenue is spent on electricity (60% with Bit-
coin, 22% with Ethereum). Assuming an average energy price (US$ 0.05 per
kWh with Bitcoin, US$ 0.12 per kWh with Ethereum7), the total power con-
sumption of the mining network is derived. The author claims that this model
does not only include power consumption that is directly used for mining but
also the power for additional needs, e.g., data center cooling.
Table 1 provides an overview of the parameters that are included into the cal-
culation of each model. The parameters show diverse characteristics, e.g., with
regard to ﬂuctuations or validity of data sources, that inﬂuence the model’s

dential rates apply.

quality of prediction. Table 2 provides an assessment of the parameters included
for power consumption estimation with respect to the source of information and
their suitability. While some of them can be gained from (rather) authoritative
sources like the blockchain directly, data sheets, reviews or press releases that
are stable with respect to time and geographic location; others heavily ﬂuctuate,
in particular acquisition and electricity costs. Thus, we consider the ﬁrst cate-
gory as being suitable for power consumption estimation; the latter category as
inappropriate – they would cause heavily ﬂuctuating ﬁnal results as well. In the
last column, Table 1 highlights the models using only suitable parameters.
From these models, Deetman’s appears most suitable for our purpose of esti-
mating a mining network’s total power consumption for the following reasons:
(i) The included parameter values are based on conﬁrmed sources, are neither
192
J. Ullrich et al.
heavily ﬂuctuating nor geographically dependent.8 (ii) A mix of mining hard-
ware is considered; results are more practical than the calculation of lower and
upper bounds as done by O’Dwyer and Malone’s model. (iii) The result includes
the power consumption that is directly used for mining only. This matches our
threat model in Sect. 3, i.e., the adversary is solely able to inﬂuence the min-
ing hardware remotely, but not supporting measures such as cooling. (iv) The
approach is universally applicable for all cryptocurrencies.
5 Total Power Consumption of Popular Mining Networks
After deciding for an appropriate model for power consumption, in this section,
we describe our approach in detail and present the results for Bitcoin and
Ethereum.
Methodology for Power Consumption Estimation: For estimating the
total power consumption of a cryptocurrency, we performed the following steps:
1. We collected the overall hash rates as well as power consumption for typical
mining hardware of the respective currency from data sheets or reviews, and
calculated the power consumption per computed hash (W/H). Current as
well as outdated hardware has been included.
2. In addition, we collected the release dates of mining hardware from data
sheets and press releases.
3. Assuming that power consumption per hash decreases over time due to better
hardware, we performed a regression analysis to ﬁnd a trend in miners’ power
eﬃciency based on the data that has been collected in step 1 and 2.
4. While the result of step 3 provides insight into the further development of
miner eﬃciency, the hash rate of the entire cryptocurrency’s mining process
has to be calculated to obtain the overall network’s power consumption. Fol-
lowing the algorithm of Ozisik et al. [25], we inferred the overall hash rate
including the parameters target (respectively diﬃculty), time interval between
consecutive blocks and the observed hash values. These values have been
gained directly from the respective public blockchain.
5. At a certain point in time, mining is not exclusively performed on newest hard-
ware but also on older hardware; therefore, we aim to create a representative
hardware mix. We assume that the increase in a cryptocurrency network’s
