## Current (minimized) example of breakage:
(courtesy of youknowone; see comments below)
    fn main() { let _a = [0, ..1 as uint]; }
## Original Report:
The following code causes the crash
    enum State { ST_NULL, ST_WHITESPACE }
    priv fn SomeFunction () -> StateTable {
        StateTable { entry: ~[mut ~[mut ST_NULL, ..ST_WHITESPACE], ..128] }
    }
The error messages are as follows:
    error: internal compiler error: unexpected failure
    note: the compiler hit an unexpected failure path. this is a bug
It seems that the compiler does not understand `entry: ~[mut ~[mut ST_NULL,
..ST_WHITESPACE], ..128]`.
