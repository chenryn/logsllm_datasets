User: Please list three common load balancing strategies in IT systems. What are their advantages and disadvantages?
Assistant: 1. Round robin load balancing strategy: Distribute requests to multiple servers in sequence, and each server handles an average number of requests. This strategy is simple to implement and is suitable for lightweight applications, but some servers may be overloaded, resulting in performance degradation. 2. Performance-based load balancing strategy: According to the performance indicators of different servers (such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, etc.), requests are allocated to servers with higher performance for processing. This strategy can improve system performance, but requires real-time monitoring of server performance indicators, which is costly. 3. Session-based load balancing strategy: Evenly distribute the requests of the same user to the same server for processing to ensure the consistency of user sessions. This strategy is suitable for applications that require users to log in, but there may be a problem that some servers are overloaded, resulting in a decrease in the performance of the entire system.
