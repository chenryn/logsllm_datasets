 **Current behaviour**
Every time I build the react app the same bundle with the same hash name is
built, Because of this the files get cached and the website loads the old
assets. Even if I have done changes in any existing (eg: css) file still the
built is creating the bundle with the same name.

**Expected behaviour**
Every time I build the app the hash name should change, Where can I configure
that in my react app.
My react version is 16.7.0, I have created my project using the create-react-
app command
