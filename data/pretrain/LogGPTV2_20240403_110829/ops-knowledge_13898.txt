User: When working in the python repl I often need to edit multiline code.
So I use import os then os.system("notepad npad.py")
In clojure I first run (use '[clojure.java.shell :only [sh]])
Then I run (sh "notepad" "jpad.clj")
This starts notepad but not in a useful way because the clojure repl now hangs. In other words, until I close notepad I cannot enter code in the repl and I want to keep both open.
I know I can easily open notepad without clojure so it is no big deal. However, is there a way for clojure to start an external process without hanging?
Assistant: It sounds like you want sh to return immediately instead of waiting for notepad's exit code.  How about writing a sh! macro or somesuch that runs the original sh command on a new Thread?  If you're only using this as a convenience in the REPL, it would be entirely unproblematic.
EDIT
Arthur's answer is better and more Clojurian - go with that.
