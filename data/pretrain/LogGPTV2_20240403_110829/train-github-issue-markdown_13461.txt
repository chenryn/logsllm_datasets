### Current Behavior
When attempting to reuse the same `TemplateRef` instance for multiple items, the view is rendered incorrectly.

### Expected Behavior
Each `TemplateRef` should render a separate view within each view container.

### Minimal Reproduction with Instructions
- **Demo**: [Plunker Example](https://plnkr.co/edit/PZe5XnmJ2KoJ99ts33F9?p=preview)
- **Current Output**: Two "Enabled" labels are displayed.
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  { "enabled": true } Enabled
  { "enabled": false } Disabled
  ```

### Motivation / Use Case
The goal is to optimize DOM performance in a slider with hundreds of slides by using lazy DOM creation. This requires reusing `TemplateRef` instances. The current approach involves:
1. Using `ngFor` and `ngTemplateOutlet` to render the template for the first 5 items.
2. Updating the references in the array as the user navigates through the slides.
