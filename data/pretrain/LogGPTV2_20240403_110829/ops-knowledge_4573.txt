User: How to quickly deploy Redis Sentinel cluster through Shell script?
Assistant: We can deploy Redis Sentinel cluster at one time through Shell script: 1. Install Redis on each target server: Redis can be installed using apt-get or yum package manager. 2. Prepare three configuration files: redis_6379.conf, redis_6380.conf, and redis_6381.conf, and configure the Redis instances of 6379, 6380, and 6381 respectively. In the configuration file, we need to add the following content: ``` # Open Sentinel sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2 sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 5000 sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 15000 sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1 ``` above configuration Sentinel will be turned on, the IP address and port of the master node will be specified as 127.0.0.1:6379, and the maximum fault detection time will be 5 seconds, and the fault timeout time will be 15 seconds. The number of slave nodes that each Sentinel node synchronizes with the master node is 1. 3. Create the start_redis_sentinel.sh script with the following content: ```#!/bin/bash # Start Redis Sentinel redis-server /etc/redis/redis_6379.conf --sentinel & redis-server /etc/redis/redis_6380.conf --sentinel & redis-server /etc/redis/redis_6381.conf --sentinel & ``` 4. Execute the script to start the Redis Sentinel cluster. The above steps can quickly deploy the Redis Sentinel cluster.
