After reading this blog post on New Experimental Console Features, I thought
this was the right time to ask for a feature request, that could be added to
the terminal options. (Or maybe even made as default behaviour?)
When cycling previously run commands with the up-arrow, it will take 8 key-
presses to reach the `ls` command in the example below  
(read from bottom to top)
    $ ls
    $ java main.
    $ javac main.java
    $ java main
    $ javac main.java
    $ java main
    $ javac main.java
    $ java main
But I want an option to remove duplicate commands, when cycling through them,
so in the example, it would only take 3 key-presses  
(read from bottom to top)
    $ ls
    $ javac main.java
    $ java main
