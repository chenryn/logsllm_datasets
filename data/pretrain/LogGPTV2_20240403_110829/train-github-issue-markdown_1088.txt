After reading the recent blog post on new experimental console features, I believe this is an opportune moment to request an additional feature for the terminal. This feature could be included as an option in the terminal settings or even set as the default behavior.

The feature I am proposing would enhance the command history navigation using the up-arrow key. Currently, when cycling through previously executed commands, it can take multiple key-presses to reach a specific command if there are many duplicate entries. For example, consider the following sequence of commands (read from bottom to top):

```
$ ls
$ java main
$ javac main.java
$ java main
$ javac main.java
$ java main
$ javac main.java
$ java main
```

In this case, it takes 8 key-presses to cycle back to the `ls` command. 

I would like to suggest an option to automatically remove duplicate commands from the history when navigating with the up-arrow key. With this feature enabled, the same sequence would look like this (read from bottom to top):

```
$ ls
$ javac main.java
$ java main
```

This would reduce the number of key-presses needed to reach the `ls` command to just 3, making the process more efficient and user-friendly.
