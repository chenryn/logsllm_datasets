### Apache Airflow version
2.2.0b2 (beta snapshot)
### Operating System
ubuntu 20.04
### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers
n/a
### Deployment
Virtualenv installation
### Deployment details
pip install /path/to/airflow/src
### What happened
Given any DAG initialized with: `schedule_interval=None`
Run `airflow dags test mydagname $(date +%Y-%m-%d)` and get an error:
    INFO - No run dates were found for the given dates and dag interval.
This behavior changed in #15397, it used to trigger a backfill dagrun at the
given date.
### What you expected to happen
I expected a backfill dagrun with the given date, regardless of whether it fit
into the `schedule_interval`.
If AIP-39 made that an unrealistic expectation, then I'd hope for some way to
define unscheduled dags which can still be tested from the command line
(which, so far as I know, is the fastest way to iterate on a DAG.).
As it is, I keep changing `schedule_interval` back and forth depending on
whether I want to iterate via `astro dev start` (which tolerates `None` but
does superfluous work if the dag is scheduled) or via `airflow dags test ...`
(which doesn't tolerate `None`).
### How to reproduce
Initialize a DAG with: `schedule_interval=None` and run it via `airflow dags
test mydagname $(date +%Y-%m-%d)`
