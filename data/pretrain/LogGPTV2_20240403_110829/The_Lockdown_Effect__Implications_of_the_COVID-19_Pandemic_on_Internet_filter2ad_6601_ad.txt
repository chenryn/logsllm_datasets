ployees to work from home. A typical way to access internal com-
pany infrastructure from home is by using VPN services. As a result,
we expect VPN traffic to increase after the lockdown.
Port-based classification. We apply a twofold approach to iden-
tify VPN traffic. First, we classify traffic as VPN traffic if the well-
known transport ports and protocols are used exclusively by a
VPN service. We only focus on major VPN protocols and identify
IPsec (port 500, 4500), OpenVPN (1194), L2TP (1701), and PPTP
(1723)—both on TCP and UDP.
Identifying VPN usage on TCP/443. Since there are, however,
many VPN services using TCP/443 to tunnel VPN traffic, a pure
port-based identification approach cannot distinguish this traffic
from HTTPS. To limit the potential for misclassification, we employ
a second approach using DNS data to identify IPs labeled as *vpn*
but not as www. in the DNS. That is, we identify potential VPN do-
mains by searching for *vpn* in any domain label left of the public
suffix [46] (e.g., companyvpn3.example.com) in (1) 2.7B domains
from TLS certificates that appeared in CT Logs during 2015–2020
and (2) 1.9B domains from Rapid7 Forward DNS queries of reverse
DNS, zonefiles, TLS certificates from the end of March 2020, and (3)
8M domains found in the Cisco Umbrella toplist in 2020. We resolve
all matching domains to 3M candidate IP addresses. In order to get
a conservative estimate of VPN traffic over TCP/443, we then also
resolve the domains from the same public suffix prepended with
www (e.g., www.example.com). If the returned addresses of the *vpn*
domain and the www domain match, we eliminate them from our
candidates. This approach limits misclassifying Web traffic destined
to the www domain as VPN traffic to the *vpn* domain, if they share
the same IP address. After removing shared IP addresses, we end up
with 1.7M candidate VPN IP addresses. We classify TCP/443 traffic
to these VPN addresses as VPN traffic.
VPN traffic on the rise. In Figure 11 we report our findings us-
ing the port-based and domain-based VPN traffic identification
approach. We use four weeks of flow data from the IXP in Central
Europe and aggregate them into workdays and weekends. Interest-
ingly, we see almost no change in port-based VPN traffic before and
after the lockdown. When looking at the VPN traffic identified with
the domain-based technique, we see a significant increase in VPN
traffic. During workdays at working hours, VPN traffic increases by
more than 200% in March compared to the base week in February.
The increase on weekends is not as pronounced as during workdays,
further indicating that these traffic shifts occur due to changes in
user behavior (i.e., people working from home). When looking at
the week in April, we still see a gain in VPN traffic compared to
February, although not as large as in March. In June, VPN traffic
decreases further compared to previous months, although its traffic
volume on workdays remains well above the levels observed for the
base week of February. This is likely due to the gradual lifting of
lockdown restrictions in Central Europe and the beginning of the
summer holiday season, resulting in fewer people working from
home in June compared to March.
In conclusion, we see a clear pattern of VPN traffic increase
during working hours due to lockdown restrictions. Moreover, as
the visible increase of VPN traffic was limited to TCP/443 on *vpn*
domains, we argue that VPN identification solely on a transport
port basis vastly undercounts actual VPN traffic. To mitigate this
problem, we propose to identify seemingly HTTPS flows as VPN
traffic using domain data. This allows for a more accurate picture
of the VPN landscape.
7 EDUCATIONAL NETWORK
In this section, we study the drastic changes induced by the lock-
down measures as seen by a large European educational and re-
search network, which connects 16 independent universities and
research centers in the metropolitan region of Madrid.
As a response to the pandemic, on March 9, 2020 the regional
government announced the closure of the entire educational sys-
tem from March 11 onward. Consequently, users of this network
(e.g., students, faculty, researchers, staff) were forced to adjust and
continue their teaching and research activities from home. Only
staff for critical maintenance tasks and security were allowed to be
on-premises. Soon after, on March 13, the National Government
declared the national state of emergency, which was effective the
next day. This drastic change in the activities performed at every
institution caused traffic shifts that differ noticeably from those
observed in any other vantage point we studied before.
Traffic volume analysis. We study the impact of the lockdown
measures on traffic volumes at the academic network by comparing
three key weeks: (1) one week before announcing that the research
and educational system will be closed down (February 27 to March
4), serving as baseline, (2) the week when the lockdown happened
(March 12–18) to observe the transitioning effect, and (3) a week
one month after lectures moved to a fully online model for most
universities (April 16–22).6
6As opposed to the previous sections, we did not include the results of our traffic
analysis of the June week. At this time, Madrid was still in an intermediary stage of
the de-scalation process. Overall, EDU traffic dropped dramatically from mid-June as
most lectures and academic activities ended for the semester. Unfortunately, we lack
access to historical traffic captures in summer time to quantify the impact that the
confinement measures had in academic traffic.

IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
Figure 11: VPN traffic at the IXP-CE: normalized aggregated traffic volume per hour at the IXP-CE vantage point for four
selected weeks. Aggregated workdays are shown as positive values, aggregated weekends as negative values. VPN servers are
identified by ports and *vpn* label in the domain name.
Figure 12a shows the normalized total traffic volume for the
three weeks considered. We observe a significant drop in traffic
volume on working days between the baseline week and the two
other weeks, with a maximum decrease of up to 55% on Tuesday and
Wednesday. Traffic on weekends, however, increased slightly: 14%
and 4% on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. The traffic reduction
on working days is expected since users no longer use the academic
network on campuses and in research facilities. We again observe
that work and weekend days are becoming more similar in terms of
total traffic. This can be the result of a new weekly working pattern
with less distinction between both types of days due to lockdown.
Similarly, a close inspection of the hourly traffic pattern reveals
a traffic increase from 11% to 24% between 9 pm and 7 am. This
could be due to users working more frequently at unusual times,
but also potentially caused by overseas students (mainly from Latin
America and East Asia as suggested by the AS numbers from which
these connections come from) who access these resources from
their home countries.
Traffic in/out ratio analysis. We depict the ingress vs. egress traf-
fic ratio in Figure 12b, showing that the ratio changed substantially
after the lockdown. In the days before the lockdown, incoming traf-
fic was up to 15x the volume of outgoing traffic during workdays.
During the transition phase, the ratio halves, and it is the lowest
during the third week (online lecturing), where weekend vs. work-
day pattern is no longer visible. This change of traffic asymmetry
can be explained by the nature of remote work. On the one end,
users connect to the network services mainly to access resources,
hence the increase in outgoing traffic. On the other end, all exter-
nal (i.e., Internet-based) resources requested during work are no
longer accessed from the educational network but from the users’
residential network, hence the drastic reduction in incoming traffic.
Connection-level analysis. To better understand the traffic shifts,
we perform a connection-level analysis, focusing on selected traffic
classes. We refer the reader to Appendix A for a list of the most
relevant classes considered in this section. We determine whether
the connections are incoming or outgoing using the AS numbers of
each end-point, interfaces, and port pairs. For instance, a connec-
tion established from a residential ISP towards an HTTPS server
hosted inside the educational network is labeled as “incoming”
connection. We cannot accurately determine the directionality for
39% of the flows observed at this academic network, many of which

appear to be P2P-like applications, marginal protocols, and non-
well-known port numbers.
The median number of the total daily connections after the
declaration of the state of emergency grows by 24% when compared
to the pre-lockdown baseline (ratio of median daily connections
before and after March 11, 2020). The usual workday-weekend
differences also decrease, but are still noticeable during the Easter
break. If we look at the directionality of the connections, the median
number of incoming connections doubles after the lockdown, while
the number of outgoing connections decreases almost by half. This
is a direct consequence of users having to access services hosted
at the academic networks from the outside, which validates the
observations made in the volumetric analysis.
Yet, the most interesting dynamics occur for specific traffic
classes. While the average number of web connections does not

behavior is antagonistic, yet complementary, to the one observed
in residential ISPs.
8 RELATED WORK
Our study provides a testimonial of the impact of an unprecedented
medical crisis in recent human history on the operation of the In-
ternet. Previous studies followed a similar approach to ours, i.e.,
collect measurements at different vantage points, to understand
the impact of other events on the Internet. Partridge et al. col-
lected and analyzed routing and protocol data during and after
9/11 to understand the resilience of the Internet under stress [8].
Their findings showed that, overall, the Internet operation was
robust: Although unexpected outages did happen, they only had a
local impact. Notice, however, that the penetration and importance
of the Internet in our life has significantly increased in the last
twenty years, and the global nature of the COVID-19 pandemic
crisis makes this case unique. Other studies focus on physical phe-
nomena, e.g., earthquakes [11] or severe weather conditions [25, 50],
and power outages [1, 4] to understand the Internet behavior and
the change on Internet user activity. Beyond physical phenomena,
also human-triggered events such as major update roll-outs can
cause substantial traffic shifts [2].
The study of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the perfor-
mance and traffic of the Internet has attracted significant attention
in the form of blogs posts [18, 31, 42, 43, 62] and more recently in
presentations at network operator conferences [36]. By the time
of our submission, a limited number of research studies have been
already published. Favale et al. report and analyze the impact of
the remote learning activity by 16k students on the Politecnico
di Torino campus network due to the lockdown enforcement [26].
The university utilized an in-house online teaching solution. Thus,
although the impact of remote learning on the campus network
shares similarities with our analysis of the academic and research
network in our study, there are also significant differences. Another
study [69] analyzed Wi-Fi network data collected at university cam-
puses in Singapore and the US during the pandemic. Their results
show that the activity on campuses decreases, but mobility did not,
as this would require more drastic measures by the governments. In
our study, we found that the mobility patterns reduced drastically
in Europe, most likely due to the stricter measures and complete
lockdowns. A study of the access patterns of Wikipedia shows that
during the pandemic Web visitors had an increased interest in top-
ics such as health [54]. This increase was even more pronounced
for countries that were in the epicenter of the pandemic. Parallel
to our work, researchers evaluated (1) the impact of the pandemic
on traffic of a UK mobile network operator reflecting changes in
users’ mobility [40], (2) changes in traffic demand at a major social
network [3], (3) transactions volumes at an underground market
during the pandemic concluding that the observed higher trans-
action volumes are a market stimulus rather than an effect of the
pandemic [65], and (4) the impact of the pandemic on Internet la-
tency in various European countries, finding an increase in the
variance of additional latency and packet loss [9].
9 DISCUSSION
Internet operation during the pandemic: a success story. The
COVID-19 pandemic “underscored humanity’s growing reliance on

lected traffic categories. Shaded gray areas indicate week-
ends, red ones indicate the transition phase enforcing con-
finement measures, and blue indicate the Easter break.
change substantially, there is a radical shift in the ratio of incoming
and outgoing connections and temporal patterns due to working
from home. Figure 13 shows the daily relative growth for selected
traffic categories. After the transition phase, the daily traffic pat-
terns for many traffic classes achieve a new status quo. The median
number of daily incoming web connections increases by over 77%
and the number of outgoing connections decreases by more than
half. As we can see in Figure 13, this reduction is even more pro-
nounced for outgoing web traffic towards hypergiants or QUIC.
In both cases, the number of outgoing connections is much lower
than in pre-COVID-19 weekends. These drops correlate with the
decrease in outgoing connections to push notification services and
mobile services for iOS and Android (65% decrease on average)—i.e.,
the number of mobile devices in the networks decreases—as well
as towards streaming services like Spotify (83% decrease).
We focus on those traffic classes that are associated with remote
working and lecturing. Table 3 provides the definition of the classes
discussed in this section. Precisely, the median incoming connection
growth for web, email, VPN, Remote Desktop, and SSH connections
is 1.7x, 1.8x, 4.8x, 5.9x, and 9.1x respectively. The significant increase
in incoming web traffic is caused by users accessing online teaching
material and other resources hosted at some of these universities,
primarily from eyeball ISPs from the same country (2.8x growth).
As mentioned in the volumetric analysis, we can observe a shift
in the hourly connection patterns for both incoming and outgoing
web connections. Traditional working hours are still noticeable—
including a drop in connections during lunch—but after the COVID-
19 outbreak, a significant fraction of users access these services
late in the evening as well as early in the morning. If we analyze
the origin ASes for these out-of-time connections, we can observe
that many connections are established from overseas eyeball ASes
from Latin America (1.8x), but also from North America (3.4x). In
fact, time zone differences are noticeable. National users access web
resources hosted at the university from 10 am to 9 pm, with a valley
from 2 to 4 pm. Latin American users start connecting at 5 pm,
presenting a peak from midnight until 7 am (peak hours are 3 and
4 am). Interestingly, while the temporal patterns for VPN, web, and
remote desktop are correlated, SSH traffic patterns are irregular.
Takeaway. Academic networks experience drastic traffic shifts due
to COVID-19. Traffic volume, directionality ratios, and its source
and destination are radically different from before COVID-19. This

digital networks for business continuity, employment, education,
commerce, banking, healthcare, and a whole host of other essential
services” [34]. At the beginning of the pandemic, changes in user
demand for online services raised concerns for network operators,
e.g., to keep networks running smoothly especially for life-critical
organizations such as hospitals [61]. In fact, the pandemic increased
the demand for applications supporting remote teaching and work-
ing to guarantee social distancing as shown in our analysis across
all vantage points. The Internet could handle this new load due
to the flexibility and elasticity that cloud services offer, and the
increasing connectivity of cloud providers [7, 10, 37, 58, 68]. Our re-
sults confirm that most of the applications with the highest absolute
and relative increases are cloud-based. Moreover, the adoption of
best practices on designing, operating, and provisioning networks
contributed to the smooth transition to the new normal. Due to the
