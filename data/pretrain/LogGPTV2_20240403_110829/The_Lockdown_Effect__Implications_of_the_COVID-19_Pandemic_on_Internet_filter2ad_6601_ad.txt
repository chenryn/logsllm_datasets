### Employee Work-from-Home and VPN Traffic Analysis

With the shift towards remote work, many employees are now working from home. A common method to access internal company infrastructure from home is through Virtual Private Network (VPN) services. Consequently, we anticipate an increase in VPN traffic following the lockdown.

#### Port-Based Classification
We employ a two-pronged approach to identify VPN traffic. First, we classify traffic as VPN if it uses well-known transport ports and protocols exclusively associated with major VPN services. Specifically, we focus on IPsec (ports 500, 4500), OpenVPN (port 1194), L2TP (port 1701), and PPTP (port 1723), all of which can operate over both TCP and UDP.

#### Identifying VPN Usage on TCP/443
However, many VPN services use TCP/443 to tunnel traffic, making it indistinguishable from HTTPS. To mitigate misclassification, we use a second approach that leverages DNS data. We search for domain labels containing "*vpn*" but not "www" in the DNS records. This involves analyzing:
1. 2.7 billion domains from TLS certificates in CT Logs (2015–2020).
2. 1.9 billion domains from Rapid7 Forward DNS queries, reverse DNS, zone files, and TLS certificates (end of March 2020).
3. 8 million domains from the Cisco Umbrella toplist (2020).

This process yields 3 million candidate IP addresses. To further refine our list, we resolve the domains with the same public suffix prepended with "www" (e.g., www.example.com). If the returned addresses for the *vpn* domain and the www domain match, we exclude them from our candidates. This reduces the risk of misclassifying web traffic as VPN traffic. After removing shared IP addresses, we end up with 1.7 million candidate VPN IP addresses. We then classify TCP/443 traffic to these IPs as VPN traffic.

### Observations of VPN Traffic Trends
In Figure 11, we present our findings using both port-based and domain-based approaches. We analyzed four weeks of flow data from a Central European Internet Exchange Point (IXP) and aggregated the data into workdays and weekends.

Interestingly, we observed no significant change in port-based VPN traffic before and after the lockdown. However, the domain-based technique revealed a substantial increase in VPN traffic. During work hours, VPN traffic increased by more than 200% in March compared to the base week in February. The increase was less pronounced on weekends, suggesting that the traffic shifts were primarily due to changes in user behavior (i.e., people working from home).

In April, we still saw an increase in VPN traffic compared to February, though not as large as in March. By June, VPN traffic decreased, but remained above the levels observed in February, likely due to the gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions and the start of the summer holiday season.

### Conclusion
Our analysis shows a clear pattern of increased VPN traffic during working hours due to lockdown restrictions. Since the increase in VPN traffic was primarily seen on TCP/443 for *vpn* domains, we argue that relying solely on transport port classification underestimates actual VPN traffic. To address this, we propose identifying seemingly HTTPS flows as VPN traffic using domain data, providing a more accurate picture of the VPN landscape.

## Educational Network Analysis
In this section, we examine the significant changes in a large European educational and research network, which connects 16 independent universities and research centers in the Madrid metropolitan area.

### Response to the Pandemic
On March 9, 2020, the regional government announced the closure of the entire educational system starting March 11. As a result, users (students, faculty, researchers, staff) had to adjust and continue their activities from home. Only essential staff for maintenance and security were allowed on-premises. On March 13, the National Government declared a state of emergency, effective the next day. These measures caused noticeable traffic shifts in the academic network.

### Traffic Volume Analysis
We studied the impact of the lockdown on traffic volumes by comparing three key weeks:
1. One week before the closure announcement (February 27 to March 4) as the baseline.
2. The week of the lockdown (March 12–18) to observe the transition.
3. A week one month after lectures moved online (April 16–22).

Figure 12a shows a significant drop in traffic volume on working days between the baseline and the other weeks, with a maximum decrease of up to 55% on Tuesday and Wednesday. Weekend traffic, however, increased slightly: 14% and 4% on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. The reduction in weekday traffic is expected as users no longer used the academic network on campuses. We also observed that work and weekend days became more similar in terms of total traffic, possibly due to a new weekly working pattern with less distinction between the two types of days.

Hourly traffic patterns revealed an increase of 11% to 24% between 9 pm and 7 am, which could be attributed to users working at unusual times or overseas students accessing resources from their home countries.

### Ingress vs. Egress Traffic Ratio Analysis
Figure 12b depicts the ingress vs. egress traffic ratio, showing a substantial change after the lockdown. Before the lockdown, incoming traffic was up to 15 times the volume of outgoing traffic during workdays. During the transition phase, the ratio halved, and it was the lowest during the third week (online lecturing), where the weekend vs. workday pattern was no longer visible. This change in traffic asymmetry can be explained by the nature of remote work, where users connect to network services to access resources, increasing outgoing traffic, while external resources are accessed from residential networks, reducing incoming traffic.

### Connection-Level Analysis
To better understand the traffic shifts, we performed a connection-level analysis, focusing on selected traffic classes. We determined the directionality of connections using AS numbers, interfaces, and port pairs. For example, a connection from a residential ISP to an HTTPS server hosted inside the educational network is labeled as "incoming." We could not accurately determine the directionality for 39% of the flows, many of which appeared to be P2P-like applications, marginal protocols, and non-standard port numbers.

The median number of daily connections grew by 24% after the state of emergency declaration. The usual workday-weekend differences decreased but were still noticeable during the Easter break. The median number of incoming connections doubled, while outgoing connections decreased by almost half. This is a direct consequence of users accessing services hosted at the academic network from outside, validating the observations from the volumetric analysis.

### Specific Traffic Classes
While the average number of web connections did not change substantially, there was a radical shift in the ratio of incoming and outgoing connections and temporal patterns due to working from home. Figure 13 shows the daily relative growth for selected traffic categories. After the transition phase, the daily traffic patterns for many traffic classes achieved a new status quo. The median number of daily incoming web connections increased by over 77%, while the number of outgoing connections decreased by more than half. This reduction was even more pronounced for outgoing web traffic towards hypergiants and QUIC, correlating with a decrease in outgoing connections to push notification services and mobile services for iOS and Android (65% decrease on average) and streaming services like Spotify (83% decrease).

### Takeaway
Academic networks experienced drastic traffic shifts due to COVID-19. Traffic volume, directionality ratios, and source and destination patterns were radically different from pre-COVID-19. This underscores the need for robust and flexible network designs to handle such sudden changes in user behavior and demand.
