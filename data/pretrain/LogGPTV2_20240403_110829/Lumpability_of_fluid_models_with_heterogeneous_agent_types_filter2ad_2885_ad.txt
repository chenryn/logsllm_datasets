This lumping turns out not to be exact for differing parameters.
Hence, we are interested to see whether Theorem 4 can be used
to estimate the resulting aggregation error.
After some algebraic manipulations, verifying the con-
dition of ε-lumpability in (12) reduces to ﬁnding a vector
ε = (ε1,1, ε1,2, ε2,1, ε2,2, ε3, ε4) such that the following two
equations are satisﬁed:
(I1 + I2)(γ1b + γ2(1 − b)) = (γ1 + ε3)I1 + (γ2 + ε4)I2
and
S1 ((β1,1 + ε1,1)I1 + (β1,2 + ε1,2)I2) +
S2 ((β2,1 + ε2,1)I1 + (β2,2 + ε2,2)I2) =
= (S1 + S2)(I1 + I2)[abβ1,1 + a(1 − b)β1,2
+ (1 − a)bβ2,1 + (1 − a)(1 − b)β2,2] .
The solution is given by ε3 = (1−b)(γ2−γ1), ε4 = b(γ1−γ2),
while the others components of ε are given by the solution of
the system
β1,1 + ε1,1 = β1,2 + ε1,2,
β2,1 + ε2,1 = β2,2 + ε2,2,
β2,1 + ε2,1 = β1,2 + ε1,2,
β2,1 + ε2,1 = abβ1,1 + a(1 − b)β1,2 + (1 − a)bβ2,1,
+ (1 − a)(1 − b)β2,2 .
(20)
Finally, we point out that the model is not ε-lumpable
for other aggregation matrices that still carry the intuitive
idea of adding similar system components. For instance, the
following M(cid:48), which yields to a less aggregated system, can
be shown not to satisfy the ε-lumpability condition, even under
the homogeneity assumption that βk,l = βl, for any class k.
M(cid:48) =

It will be the topic of future investigations to characterize
which aggregation matrices yield ε-lumpable based on the
structure of the vector ﬁeld.
C. A Model of Generalized Processor Sharing
We end this section with a ﬂuid model for a simple tandem
queueing network with three classes of jobs consisting of a
queue which serves with GPS discipline and a delay (i.e.,
inﬁnite server) station. Following [1], it can be shown that
the ﬂuid limit is given by the following ODE system.
˙Q1 = −µ1
˙D1 = − ˙Q1,
˙Q2 = −µ2
˙D2 = − ˙Q2,
˙Q3 = −µ3
˙D3 = − ˙Q3.

Here, Qi gives the GPS queue length and Di gives the number
of jobs for the job of class i, for i = 1, 2, 3; λi are the rates
at the delay station, C is the total capacity at the GPS queue,
and φi is the share of the capacity assigned to the i-th class.
Finally, µi is the service demand at the GPS queue.
Let us
compactly denote
˙X =
f (X, α), with X = (Q1, D1, Q2, D2, Q3, D3) and α =
(µ1, φ1, µ2, φ2, µ3, φ3, λ1, λ2, λ3). The aggregation we wish to
perform is to lump two classes of clients, e.g., by the following

We have written out
the equations required to ﬁnding
ε to highlight that, in this model, the computations can be
automatized since the resulting problem is a system of linear
equations (where the component of ε are the only unknowns).
Furthermore, this turns out to be the case regardless of the
Unless the corresponding parameters are equal, i.e., µ1 = µ2,
λ1 = λ2, and φ1 = φ2, the lumping is not exact. We look then
for the possibility to estimate the lumping error by means of
Theorem 4. As in the previous example, the ε = (ε1, . . . , ε9)

in this model
Interestingly, unlike the previous examples where the Lip-
schitz continuity of f (x, α) with respect to α always holds
uniformly with x,
the boundedness of the
norm of the Jacobian can be shown to hold in a particular
parameter region. Speciﬁcally, it sufﬁces to assume that the
µ1 + µ2 + µ3 ≤ φi for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, together with Proposition 1.
However,
this restriction is without any loss of generality
since the parameters φi encode the relative shares of the
corresponding job classes, and can be conveniently re-scaled so
as to satisfy this condition, whilst maintaining their proportions
unchanged.
V. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
The purpose of this section is to provide numerical evi-
dence on the robustness of the aggregation of heterogeneous
agent types when the model enjoys ε-lumpability. We focus
our attention on the multi-class SIR model discussed in Sec-
tion IV-B, however qualitatively similar results hold for the
other examples discussed in the rest of the paper.
We perform a sensitivity analysis of the lumping error with
respect to the size of the aggregated model and to the degree
of heterogeneity of the original system. To reduce the number
of degrees of freedom in the choice of the model parameters in
(19), we ﬁx positive β and γ, and ∆, and set all the parameters
of the vector ﬁeld as follows:
βi,j := β + (i − 1)(j − 1)∆,
γi := γ + 2(i − 1)∆.
Thus, the degree of heterogeneity is directly related to ∆.
We ﬁrst experimented with an original system with K = 3,
parameters β = 15 and γ = 10, and initial conditions:
S1(0) = 0.6,
I1(0) = 10−6,
R1(0) = 0,
S2(0) = 0.3,
I2(0) = 10−6,
R2(0) = 0,
S3(0) = 0.1,
I3(0) = 10−6,
R3(0) = 0.
(22)
These values correspond to a situation where almost all in-
dividuals are initially healthy and only a small proportion is
infected.
We considered a reduction that aggregates two agent types,
leading to an ODE system of size 6, and one which considers
the fully homogeneous model which aggregates all 3 agent
types, leading to a system of 3 ODEs. In both cases, we let ∆
vary between 0.05 and 1.0 in 0.05 steps.
Figure 2 shows two representative plots of the model
solution for varying ∆. It can be noticed that, with this choice
of parameters, the time interval [0, 4] is representative of the
most interesting dynamics of the original system, since the
time for the solution to reach an equilibrium decreases with

increasing ∆. Thus we ﬁxed t = 4 as the ﬁnal time point for
the numerical integration of all ODE solutions.
Figure 3 compares the impact of ∆ on the a-posteriori
error, measured as in (18), and on the tightest a-priori bound,
obtained by optimization of the solution of the linear system
of equations for ε, as in (20). Perhaps unexpectedly, we notice
that
the a-priori bound is a poor estimator of the actual
quality of the aggregation, since in all cases the bounds are
separated by many orders of magnitude from the corresponding
a-posteriori errors. This is the price to pay for obtaining an
estimate at a very low computational cost. On the other hand,
it may provide some qualitative indication of the trend of the
actual error incurred with respect to the number of variables
to be aggregated or to the degree of heterogeneity of the
system. At least for the cases examined in this section, the fully
aggregated model with 3 ODEs is an excellent approximation
to the original system.
To conﬁrm the robustness of the a-posteriori errors for ε-
lumpable systems, we considered the case for K = 4 and
with higher degrees of heterogeneity, which was studied for an
aggregation that lumps all types into a single macro-variable,
yielding a system of 3 ODEs in total. In this case, we also
experimented with different initial conditions, since they do
not have an impact on the a-priori bound, but may affect the
actual error incurred by the aggregation. For this study, we set
β and γ as before, and let ∆ vary between 1.0 and 20.0 at 1.0
steps. The initial conditions were set as
S1(0) = s1, S2(0) = s2, S3(0) = s3, S4(0) = s4,
for sk between 0.1 and 0.9 at 0.1 steps such that(cid:80)
with Ik(0) = 10−6 and Rk(0) = 0, for all 1 ≤ k ≤ 4, and
k sk = 1.
For each value of ∆, we measured the minimum, average, and
maximum a-posteriori errors across all the model instances
with different initial conditions.

rate functions that involve rational expressions.
The authors of [26] consider ﬁberwise stability as a class
of nonlinear systems amenable to approximate reduction, al-
though they do not provide an a-priori bound. In practice,
the method requires ﬁnding a Lyapunov function for the
original systems to be reduced. This approach is analogous
to [20], where an a-priori bound is provided for the model
reduction of biochemical networks, subject
to providing a
suitable storage function. Exploiting the fact that biochemical
networks have dynamics based on polynomials, the authors
derive an approach based on sum-of-squares optimization to
ﬁnd such a storage function. This approach, however, does not
cover models that involve rational expressions or threshold-
like functions such as maxima or minima, as in the case of
bandwidth sharing.
As discussed in Section II, aggregation techniques espe-
cially aimed at ﬂuid models of computing systems have been
recently presented in [28], but only for exact lumping.
We are not aware of related work that focusses on model
reduction by approximate lumping as is done in this paper.
b) Relation to perturbation theory: In the remainder
of this section, instead, we wish to establish a relation be-
tween our notion and ε-lumpability and perturbation theory
(e.g., [18]), since in both cases the aim is to essentially consider
the effect of the variation of a model parameter about a
reference value. However, using an example of a simple linear
ODE system we wish to stress that, in general, perturbation
theory cannot help with providing a result of an a-priori worst-
case linear growth of the approximation error as instead is the
case for ε-lumpability.
