ABSTRACT
We propose a novel group-oriented signature scheme, called a
democratic group signature (DGS). In DGS the scheme setting
is controlled on a contributory basis, i.e., without any central-
ized trusted authority (group manager). Group members agree
on a common tracing trapdoor, i.e., every member can trace
issued signatures individually. Members are able to sign on
behalf of the group while remaining anonymous only to third
parties. DGS supports dynamic changes of the group formation
(joins and leaves of members). For security reasons the trac-
ing trapdoor is updated after every dynamic change. The DGS
model results from strong changes to the standard model of
group signatures caused by elimination of the group manager’s
role and distribution of the tracing rights to individuals.
1. APPLICATION SCENARIOS
DGS can be deployed in various group-oriented applications.
We consider a use case of the shared ﬁnancial control in a
joint venture company (JVCo). JVCos are a popular way for
partner companies to form strategic alliances for economic ex-
pansion. JVCo is an independent company which is set up to
procure the joint project. Its ﬁnancial control is done jointly
by partner companies and is based on the“trust, but verify”
relationship (TbV) followed from the natural objective of JV
partners to get a higher proﬁt from JVCo, sometimes at the
expense of other partners. JVCo has an own budget to which
every partner contributes. Every partner is allowed to issue
(sign) payment orders from this budget to third parties on be-
half of JVCo. If the issued payment amount exceeds the contri-
bution of a partner then it is obliged to refund the diﬀerence to
the budget later. In the context of TbV every partner should
be able to reveal the current state of other partners’ debts to
the JVCo’s budget independently. Thus, partners should be
able to trace every signed order to its issuer. At the same time
third parties which receive the payment should not be able to
reveal which JVCo partner has issued the order. This is mo-
tivated by JVCo’s wish for own independence, especially if it
enters the market with its own trademark.

2. DEMOCRATIC GROUP SIGNATURES
In the following we use a counter value t ≥ 0 in the subscript
of the parameters to denote that the parameter is valid for the
group formation after the t-th dynamic event.
DGS consists of: a randomized protocol Setup between found-
ing group members that outputs a public group key Y[0], and to
every member i its secret signing key xi[0] and a tracing trap-
door ˆx[0]; a randomized protocol Join between current group
members and a joining member that outputs Y[t+1], and to ev-
ery member i (including the joined member) xi[t+1] and ˆx[t+1];
a randomized protocol Leave between remaining group mem-
bers (after exclusion of a member) that outputs Y[t+1], and
to every remaining member i its xi[t+1] and ˆx[t+1]; a random-
ized algorithm Sign that on input xi[t], Y[t], and a message m
outputs a signature σ; a deterministic algorithm Verify that
on input σ, m, and Y[t] returns 1 if and only if σ was gener-
ated by a group member i using Sign on input xi[t], Y[t], and
m; a randomized algorithm Trace that on input σ, m, Y[t],
and the tracing trapdoor ˆx[t] returns the signer’s identity i to-
gether with a proof π of this fact; a deterministic algorithm
VerifyTrace that on input σ, m, Y[t], i, π returns 1 if and only
if i and π were returned by Trace on input σ, m, ˆx[t], Y[t];
The public group key Y[t] should be published and updated
authentically. All members share the same tracing trapdoor
ˆx[t] which allows individual tracing of signatures (as required
for the monitoring of the accounting in JVCo). Note that ˆx[t]
should be updated on every join and leave.
DGS is secure if it satisﬁes the following (informal) require-
ments: Anonymity, i.e., there exists no PPT adversary A (non-
member of the current group formation) that, given access to
Join, Leave, and Sign queries and all public parameters of DGS,
can distinguish between two identities i0 and i1 for a given
signature σib , and Traceability, i.e., there exists no PPT ad-
versary A (including collusion of group members) that, given
access to Join, Leave, Sign, CorruptMember, and RevealTrap-
door queries, can output a forged signature that cannot be
traced to one of the group members corrupted by A.
Our description of anonymity subsumes unlinkability and
the description of traceability subsumes well-known collusion-
resistance, framing and unforgeability requirements.
In the full version we show diﬀerences between DGS and other
group-oriented signatures, present its formal model, describe
our realization based on two cryptographic primitives (contrib-
utory group key agreement (CGKA) protocols and signatures of
knowledge (SK)), and prove its security in the random oracle
model. A secure CGKA protocol is used to initialize and update
ˆx[t], and SK allows members to preserve anonymity against
third parties by making the signer’s identity indistinguishable
using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system for the
knowledge of 1-out-of-n discrete logarithms.
