### XMPP/Jabber and Related Technologies

#### Overview
- **XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)**, also known as Jabber, is a widely used protocol for real-time communication.
- **Transports**: These allow interoperability with other messaging systems.
- **Short Mail**: A method of sending short messages via email, often received as text messages on mobile devices.
- **Internet to Mobile Communications**: Techniques for sending messages from the internet to mobile phones.

#### Short Mail and Texting
- **Number + Carrier = Victim**: Users receive an email message that appears as a text message on their mobile device.
- **Cost**: Equivalent to a standard text message.
- **Delivery**: Received as a text message, not an email.

#### Conventional Spamming Techniques
- **Mass Emailers**: Tools for sending large volumes of emails.
- **Spoofing the Source Address**: Faking the sender's address to avoid detection.
- **Carrier Identification**: Services online can identify the carrier.
- **Scriptable**: Automated scripts can be used to send short mail, which is accepted by default.

#### Message Limitations
- **Character Limit**: Messages over 160 characters may be truncated.
- **Carrier Identification**: Proper identification of the carrier is necessary for message delivery.
- **No Delivery Confirmation**: There is no way to confirm if the message was delivered.

#### User Charges and Control
- **Incoming Texts**: Charged to the user.
- **Sending Short Mail**: Can be done from any email client.
- **Default Settings**: Enabled by default.
- **Carrier Controls**: Limited methods to stop the attack.

#### Carrier-Specific Policies
- **Sprint**:
  - Maximum 50 blocked emails per domain.
  - Cannot block everything.
- **Verizon**:
  - Maximum 10 blocked emails per domain.
  - Can block everything.
- **AT&T**:
  - Maximum 15 blocked emails per domain.
  - Cannot block everything.

#### Recommendations for Short Mail
- **Decoupling from SMS**: Short mail should not be directly tied to SMS.
- **Message Flagging**: Implement flags to identify message origin.
- **User Control**: Features should be easily adjustable by users.
- **Default Settings**: Should be turned off by default.
- **Blocking Power**: More power should be given to users to block unwanted messages.

#### XML-Based Communication
- **XML Communication**: Facilitates real-time communication.
- **Server Setup**: Easy to set up your own server.
- **Platform Options**: Multiple options for different platforms.
- **Legacy Chat Integration**: Allows integration with legacy chat systems.
- **Message Flow Control**: No rate limiting.

#### Popular Messaging Services
- **Google Talk, Yahoo, AIM, MSN**: Users can input a phone number to add a contact.
- **Message Format**: Messages are sent as SMS.

#### Service-Specific Behaviors
- **Google Talk**:
  - Forces a response after a chat is initiated.
  - No response after a few messages stops the chat.
- **Yahoo**:
  - Forces a response and performs throttling.
- **AOL**:
  - Does not force a response but does throttle messages.

#### Rate Limiting and Message Handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Imposed when sending messages too fast.
- **Message Splitting**: Messages over 160 characters are split into multiple messages.
- **Message Size**: 1 message = 13 messages (2000 bytes max).
- **Initial Acceptance**: Required for chatting.
- **Abuse Prevention**: Can be programmatically managed.

#### Transport Mechanisms
- **Transport as a Bolt-On**: Added to a Jabber server.
- **Service Directory**: Appears in the service directory for the hosted Jabber domain.
- **Legacy Services Bonding**: Users can bond to legacy services like AOL.
- **Jabber_Name -> AOL**: Log in to Jabber and see AOL contacts.
- **Multiple Bonds**: One Jabber name can bond to multiple AOL names.
- **Public Transports**: Available for use.

#### Internal Server Configuration
- **Internal Jabber Server with AIM Transport**:
  - Bond internal Jabber accounts with AOL accounts.
  - Send messages to phones using internal Jabber accounts.
  - Programmatically handle connection, bonding, and authorization.

#### Mass Messaging
- **Generate Phone List**: Create a list of phone numbers.
- **Generate AOL Account List**: Must own these accounts.
- **Send Giant Messages**: Send one large message per number (up to 1000 messages per second).
- **Multiple Messages**: Send multiple messages with delays to avoid rate limits.

#### Challenges and Support
- **Single Point of Failure**: AOL is the single point of failure.
- **Rate Limiting**: A significant challenge.
- **Message Queuing**: Carriers queue messages.
- **Bandwidth Limitations**: Limited bandwidth.
- **Message Dropping**: Some messages may be dropped.
- **Spam Protection**: AOL provides support to combat spam and allows users to block messages.

#### High-Speed Messaging and Security
- **High-Rate Sending**: Send messages at high speeds.
- **SOCKS Proxies**: Some transports support SOCKS proxies (e.g., Tor).
- **Public Transports**: Often found in other countries, useful for hiding.
- **Programmatic Attacks**: All attacks can be done programmatically without user interaction.

#### Improvements and Future Directions
- **AOL Implementation**: Needs to follow Yahoo and Googleâ€™s design.
- **Improved Protection**: Better protection since initial testing.
- **ToC Servers**: No longer support Internet to mobile communications.

#### Framework and Proof-of-Concept
- **Framework Benefits**:
  - Eliminates dependencies with libraries.
  - Can be made into a modular framework.
  - Accessible by many people.
- **Proof-of-Concept Capabilities**:
  - Bonding of names.
  - Sending messages through various transports.
  - Sending spoofed short mail messages.
  - Identifying public transports.
  - Additional features can be added.
