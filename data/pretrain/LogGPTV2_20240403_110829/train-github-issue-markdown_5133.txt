Any other software?
    # Steps to reproduce
    Build code from 42c1e58966b50c72039808b09b663b74180519ce and the build completes, but when I start the app, I get failures and app just instantly closes out.
    If I restore the file (src/cascadia/TerminalConnection/ConhostConnection.cpp) from 0da13cdf2d5ba2081f12f85f6816546489d4918b to any newer code then build succeeds and the app starts normally
    # Expected behavior
    I expect the newer version of src/cascadia/TerminalConnection/ConhostConnection.cpp to not cause the app to crash on startup
    I start the app with newest code and app crashes.  But when I restore the file of src/cascadia/TerminalConnection/ConhostConnection.cpp to pre 42c1e58966b50c72039808b09b663b74180519ce version, everything works fine.
    # Actual behavior
    The app crashes when I use the latest code of src/cascadia/TerminalConnection/ConhostConnection.cpp
