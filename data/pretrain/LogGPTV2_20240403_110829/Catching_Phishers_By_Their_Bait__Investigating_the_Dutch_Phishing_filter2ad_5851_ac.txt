ating unique ﬁngerprints for each of these kits is therefore
difﬁcult, as such ﬁngerprints could easily match a slightly
changed or copied version of another kit. To solve this prob-
lem and enable analysis on their usage, we categorized the
gathered phishing kits into 10 families by comparing the ﬁles
present within each kit. For each of the gathered phishing kits,
we calculated the percentage of overlapping ﬁles by compar-
ing them pairwise and counting ﬁle path matches. Following
a similar methodology as Bijmans et al. [3], we used a graph
structure to ﬁnd clusters of similar phishing kits that we can
group into families. Displayed in Figure 7 we ﬁnd a directed
graph with phishing kits shown as nodes and edges created
due to overlapping ﬁles. An edge between two phishing kits
is created if 75% of the ﬁles in a kit are overlapping. To ﬁnd
families of kits that belong together, we employed a commu-
nity extraction technique proposed by Blondel et al. [4]. This
is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. The
resulting structure describes how the network can be compart-
mentalized into smaller sub networks. Utilizing this technique
we determined 10 families of at least two phishing kits per
family, in which we group 53 phishing kits. The remaining
17 phishing kits have no signiﬁcant overlap with others and
are thus considered not part of any family. An overview of
the ﬁve largest phishing kit families can be found in Table 2.
When taking a closer look at Figure 7, we clearly observe
one large interconnected network containing four different
phishing kit families - the uAdmin, tikkie, ics, and livepanel
families. From this large community we can conﬁrm the hy-
pothesis that phishing kits ‘learn’ – or steal – a lot from each
other. The uAdmin and tikkie families have a lot of overlap-
ping ﬁles, but are nevertheless separated in two families. By
examining the codebase of both these families more closely
we can see that, whilst they both build upon the same frame-
work – which will be explained in the following paragraph –
they have slightly different possibilities. Following this same
logic, we took a closer look at the ics family. These kits are
connected to the larger network through merely one kit. The
framework used in that phishing kit connects the ics family
to the network and is again built upon the same codebase as
the rest of the cluster. However, it is interesting that the other
three kits in the ics family are not built upon this framework,
but do have the same target as the connecting phishing kit.
This indicates that this family has ‘evolved’ into using this
framework to perform their phishing activities, adapting to
newer technologies. The other, smaller families, positioned
to the right in Figure 7, clearly employ different tactics com-
pared to the large interconnected network. For example, the
ﬁve phishing kits in the bonken family are all built upon the
ASP.NET Core platform, and have nothing in common with
the other clusters. As the two largest families and 26 phishing
kits in our dataset are build upon the same framework, we
highlight its characteristics in the following paragraph.
uAdmin framework Universal Admin – better known as
the uAdmin control panel – is a framework written in PHP and
uses a SQLite3 database for information storage. As PHP can
be found on almost every Web server and has built-in support
for SQLite, this panel can be deployed very easily. It allows
for many different templates for most Dutch banks, as well as
various decoy pages (as explained in Section 2.1). An unique
feature is that the administrator panel can be hosted separately

from the phishing page. This makes it easy to setup multiple
phishing domains and proxy all their connections to a control
panel hosted elsewhere. Part of the uAdmin framework is the
O-token plugin, enabling real-time interaction with the victim.
It includes a detailed log of all entered information, as well as
buttons to prompt the victim for more input and the possibility
to integrate Jabber notiﬁcations. This real-time interaction
with the victim also allows the attacker to act as a man-in-the-
middle to defeat two-factor authentication defenses. uAdmin
employs a number of anti-detection methods. There is an
antibot.php script, which blocks a list of IP addresses, host
names and User-Agents. Additionally, when a victim visits
one of the pages, a unique folder is created on the Web server,
all necessary resources are copied into it and the victim is
redirected to that folder after a timeout of 1 second, as shown
in Listing 1.

This code snippet is very similar to the code mentioned by
Han et al. [17] and Oest et al. [39] and tries to prevent detec-
tion by anti-phishing services like PhishTank [40] or Google
Safe Browsing [20]. Han et al. [17] discovered that these anti-
phishing bodies crawl submitted domains themselves and
place the landing URL on their block lists. In this case, this is
a random path on the Web server, hereby preventing detection.
In February, 2021, the Ukrainian attorney general’s ofﬁce re-
ported that they arrested the developer of the uAdmin phishing
kit, after reports that it was used in more than half of all phish-
ing attacks in Australia in 2019 [25]. The Australian Federal
Police stated that “Pretty much every Australian received a
half dozen of these phishing attempts." [25]. Financial insti-
tutions in 11 countries including the United States, Italy and
the Netherlands were suffering from phishing attacks through
uAdmin.
5 Phishing domain analysis
Using the method of analyzing the stream of issued TLS
certiﬁcates in real time as described in Section 3.2, our do-
main detector labeled 7,936 domains as potentially malicious,
which meant that these domains reached the threshold value
and are further analyzed by our crawler. The domain crawler
could match ﬁngerprints of known phishing kits on 1,504 of
these domains, which we all manually checked for false posi-
tives. We removed 61 domains on which our crawler discov-
ered ﬁngerprints, but no actual phishing took place. On most
of these domains, this was the result of a ﬁngerprint not being
speciﬁc enough, and in some cases the domain responded
successfully to all HTTP GET requests and thus matched all
ﬁngerprints. Finally, as we are investigating the complete end-
to-end life cycle of phishing campaigns, we only included
domains able to complete a life cycle. This meant that we
excluded domains that were discovered in the ﬁnal week of
the data collection period and therefore omitted another 80 do-
mains from our dataset. Our ﬁnal dataset contained 1,363 ver-
iﬁed phishing fully qualiﬁed domain names (FQDN) which
have been online for at least one hour. These were hosted
on 1,112 different registered domain names (RDN), as some
domains hosted multiple phishing pages on different subdo-
mains. A summary of our dataset is listed in Table 3.

5.1 Domain name characteristics
Setting up a new phishing domain requires a balance between
the right amount of persuasion of the victim and stealth to
prevent early detection by anti-phishing organizations. As
explained in Section 3.2, common practices to hide malicious
activity are to obfuscate (parts of) the URL by using deceptive
subdomains, Punycode or typosquatting. The use of deceptive
subdomains is categorized as type III by Oest et al. [38] and
we could discover only 66 of such domains in our dataset. As
listed in Table 4, we identiﬁed much more type IV domains
(1,297) in our dataset. 16 of the 66 type III phishing FQDNs
increased their credibility by including the full FQDN of the
target brand as subdomains. This practice can be the result
of either one of the following techniques: this RDN could be
hijacked or especially chosen to increase stealth. In the case
of hijacked domains, attackers have taken control over the
domain and made (multiple) subdomains for their phishing
page, a practice discussed extensively by Han et al. [17]. For
the other technique, adding the domain of the targeted bank
as a subdomain is done to increase the credibility of the URL,
which works especially well on mobile devices on which the
complete URL is not always shown in the GUI. Distinctions
between these two categories are difﬁcult to make, as we can
not determine whether a domain is hijacked or chosen on
purpose by the attacker to avoid early detection.
Although mentioned in related and previous work on this
phenomenon [26, 30], we did not ﬁnd any successful usage
of Punycode obfuscated domains in our dataset. The use of
Punycode did increase the malicious score of a domain in
our domain detector, and we identiﬁed 21 of such domains,
but our crawler did not ﬁnd matching ﬁngerprints on any of
them. This could indicate that the use of Punycode is less
popular among attackers focused on Dutch consumers, as we
did ﬁnd references to other banks outside our scope. On the
other hand, typosquatting – also known as URL-hijacking –
is found 36 times in our dataset. The practice of replacing the
character i with l in domains mimicking the ING Bank and
ICS Cards is popular, as we found respectively 16 and 20 of
such domains.
However, most phishing FQDNs in our dataset simply ob-
fuscate their malicious intents by not mentioning the name
of the target organization. As shown in Table 5, more than
half of the domains in our dataset (770) did not include any
references to Dutch banks, but were detected because of other
words mentioned, which we included in our methodology
as suspicious keywords. These words refer to either banking
related matters – e.g., payment, veriﬁcation or debit card – or
to completely different matters, often related to the decoys
mentioned in Section 2.1.
Targeted banks An analysis of the FQDNs that do refer to
one of the targeted banks results in insights into their popu-
larity. Note however, indicators in the domain name are not
always directly linked to the actual Web page on that domain
– e.g., a domain including a reference to bank A contains the
login screen of bank B. Our domain detector searched for ref-
erences to the ten largest Dutch retail banks and two daughter
brands of ABN AMRO – Tikkie and ICS Cards – within all
domains and was able to identify 593 FQDNs referring to
one of them. As shown in Table 5, we found 194 domains
referring to the Rabobank, which makes it the prime target
for attackers. In contrast, only ten domains contained refer-
ences to Regiobank, making this bank to seem a less attractive
target.
5.2 Domain registrations
When choosing a top-level domain (TLD) as an attacker, it
is important to keep in mind that different registries have
different policies when it comes to monitoring and cleaning
of their TLD. Some registries allow registrars – the companies
selling the domains used for phishing to the attackers – to sell
large quantities of domain names to attackers and are hereby
knowingly contributing to online abuse. As The Spamhaus
project states: “Some registrars and resellers knowingly sell
high volumes of domains to these actors for proﬁt, and many
registries do not do enough to stop or limit this endless supply
of domains.” [41]. The Spamhaus Project monitors domains in
SPAM messages and calculates the percentage of bad domains
within each TLD zone. We compare their data with our results
to ﬁnd out whether phishers focused on Dutch consumers
favour these TLDs over the more regularly used TLDs in the
Netherlands. The results of our analysis – listed in in the ﬁrst
columns of Table 6 – show that .info is the most commonly
used TLD in our dataset, followed by .xyz. These phishers
tend to choose one of the many ‘bad’ TLDs, but they also
stick to the more commonly used TLDs in the Netherlands,
such as .com and .nl.
Domain registrars Using the retrieved WHOIS records, we
were able to identify the registrar of 933 of the 1,112 RDNs in
our dataset, we thus have no information about the registrar for
179 RDNs. Inspecting the WHOIS records of the 933 domains,
revealed that Namecheap is by far the most popular registrar
used by phishers, as 72.6% of all phishing domains was reg-
istered through that registrar. Other large registrars, such as
