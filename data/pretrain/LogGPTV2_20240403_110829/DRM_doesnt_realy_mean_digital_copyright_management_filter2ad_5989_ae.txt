Arguably  the  Giovanni  system  should  be  far  preferable  to  those 
seeking to maintain fair use and access of traditional information 
markets.  Giovanni offers critical functionality that is aligned with 
the value of copyright to society: archiving, maintenance of author 
information,  and  no  innate  restrictions  on  access.    The  basic 
concept,  to  allow  people  to  view  rather  than  to  assume  each 
viewer  is  about  engage  in  a  criminal  act,  is  embedded  in 
copyright.   
Giovanni  offers  critical  functions  of  copyright. 
  Giovanni 
maintains copies as an archive as well as ensuring that those who 
have  purchased  services  can  alter  the  format  of  the  material  to 
keep up to date. 
If  the  watermarking  allows  for  a  history  of  use,  just  as  this 
document  embeds  references  and  quotation  from  other  works, 
then Giovanni offers a method for building complex hyper-linked 
trustworthy  documents.    This  depends  on  the  existence  of 
homomorphisms in the watermarking system used, and the size of 
the  sample  necessary  to  extract  attribute  data.    (Currently 
Giovanni requires 7 seconds of CD quality sound or 104 pixels to 
extract the watermarked data.) The inclusion of watermarks could 
be used to identify annotations in an individual copy. 
Giovanni  does  not  function  to  provide  a  tree-like mechanism so 
that  the  interrelationship  between  documents  can  be  traced.  
However, with market dominance it could provide something not 
unlike citeseer (http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/). 
The  practice  of  embedding  consumer  information  assumes  that 
only the consumer would release the data and does not address the 
possibility of data theft.  In the case of data theft the consumer is 
subject  to  the  inherent  punishment  of  exposure  of  sensitive 
information.    Given  that  identity  theft  costs  the  victim  on  the 
order  of  thousands  and  recovery  takes  an  average  of  eighteen 
months this would be a punishment unlikely to be sustainable as a 
matter of policy.  While the feature is optional, the choice is up to 
the producer.  In the case of embedding information the producer 
is  allowed  to  select  the  level  of  risk  for  the  customer  without 
customer input.  In addition this option precludes the ability read 
anonymously.   
Does Blue Spike does not solve the problem of persistent storage 
or  search?  The  question  with  respect  to  Giovanni  is  if  a  single 
company  can  serve  the  role  of  the  Royal  Library  –  creation  of 
effective  copyright  protection,  archiving,  and  access.    Of  all  the 
systems,  Giovanni  is  the  nearest  to  serving  the  functions  of  the 
copyright system for digital content. 
7.  CONCLUSIONS 
Copyright is a set of narrow legal rights built on a technologically 
deterministic foundation and embedded in a particular economic 
system.  Extracting the functions of the technology, the law, and 
the economics enables a return to first principles for the design of 
DRM  systems.    That  set  of  functions,  which  I  refer  to  as  copy 
accuracy  to  prevent  confusion  with  copyright  per  se,  is  not 
entirely provided by any DRM system.  Systems which fall under 
the  rubric  of  copyright  today  by  virtue  of  protecting  content 
sometimes  do  enhance  the  market  element  of  copy  accuracy, 
however,  sometimes  at  the  price  of  the  other  functions  of  the 
copyright  system.    Similarly  code  that  breaks  content  control 
mechanisms  enhances  some 
functions  of  copyright  and 
undermines others. 
It is a common assertion that authors want to be remunerated with 
some combination of reputation and wealth.  If information can be 
said to have desire, then information wants to be used and trusted.  
The increasing value of the readers’ attention span should also be 
considered in the information economy.  Neither those who seek 
to  manage  authors’  rights  nor  the  defenders  of  access  rights  are 
entirely aligned with the purposes of copyright in that no system 
motivates and awards filtering, rating and distribution. 
No  DRM  or  DRM  circumvention  system  implements  personal 
persistent annotation, with integrity.  It is related to the fact that 
no  DRM  or  DRM  circumvention  system  rewards  filtering.    It  is 
worth  noting  that  some  peer-to-peer  systems  that  are  decried  as 
being  an  assault  on  copyright  are  designed  such  that  filtering  is 
intrinsic to the system (for example, Napster).   
 Future  work  entails  examination  of  more  digital 
rights 
management systems.  Of course, the most interesting question is 
designing a system that fulfills completely the functions identified 
here as copy accuracy.  These extensions of the work are currently 
being addressed in ongoing research.
