reset
Resets DiskShadow.exe to the default state. This command is especially useful in separating compound DiskShadow operations, such as create, import, backup, or restore.
[!IMPORTANT
After you run this command, you will lose state information from commands, such as add, set, load, or writer. This command also releases IVssBackupComponent interfaces and loses non-persistent shadow copies.
