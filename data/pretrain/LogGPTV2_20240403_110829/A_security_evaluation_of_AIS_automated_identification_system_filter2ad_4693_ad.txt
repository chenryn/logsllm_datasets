27As a receiver, we used the Weatherdock EasyTRX2 hard-
ware transponder
we took appropriate precautions to conduct the experiment
in a safe manner.
We used an ampliﬁer to raise the 50 mW power output of
the SDR peripheral to values being in the same order of com-
mercial AIS transponders28. This was accomplished through
a hardware modiﬁcation of a traditional VHF transceiver –
KENWOOD TK-762G. Note that this device is aﬀordable
(i.e., less than 100$ on eBay) and gives attackers an easy
access to the hardware needed to conduct malicious activi-
ties. The hardware modiﬁcation entailed disconnecting the
pre-ampliﬁer’s output, i.e.
the circuitry from microphone
to hybrid module’s input, and soldering an external coaxial
cable to connect the SDR.
We then built two AIS antennas to simulate a more ac-
curate attack scenario. For the receiver, we used an omni-
directional antenna consisting of a 5 element collinear struc-
ture, i.e. a standard installation for ships and VTS. For the
attacker, we used a Moxon directional antenna in order to
sustain the ampliﬁed signal and improve the attacker’s cov-
erage and precision. The power gain of our antennas was
respectively 6 and 10 dBi.
As we already mentioned, our coverage experiment con-
sisted of transmitting a testing message from a ﬁxed station
and of using a movable receiver to verify the coverage exper-
imentally. By using diﬀerent conﬁgurations, as we report in
Table 2, we showed that an attacker is able to reach a victim
station and convey AIS messages from a distance of approx-
imately 16.5 kilometers, at the least.
For example, by substituting the transmitter’s default an-
tenna (λ/429) with the directional one that we built, the cov-
erage doubled, i.e. from 0.8 to 1.5 kilometers. Further im-
provements are conﬁrmed when the ampliﬁer is used. Note
that our ampliﬁer comes with two selectable output power
levels of 5 W and 15 W. These values are in the same order
of standard AIS transponders, i.e. class-B and class-A re-
spectively. In these condition, we scored a coverage of 8 and
16.5 kilometers. Note that this value is a lower estimation
because our testing site was located near mountains that
attenuated the signal we transmitted.
7. RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE AND MIT-
IGATION STRATEGIES
Clearly, generating and tampering with AIS information
may raise ethical concerns. As researchers, we are fully
aware of that and we believe that realistic experiments, like
the ones conducted by Jakobsson et al.
in [12, 13], are the
only way to reliably evaluate attacks in a real-world.
During our experiments, we only used harmless and test-
ing messages and we did not interfere with existing systems.
We also physically connected our equipment, i.e. AISTX
and receivers, in order to not propagate RF signals over the
air. The coverage experiment was conducted on land (at the
coordinates 45.69N,9.72E) and we veriﬁed that no AIS re-
ceiving installations were present by using information made
public by online providers; the closest open water (Mediter-
ranean Sea) was 200 kilometers away and all nearby waters
were not navigable.
As part of responsible disclosure, we reached out upfront
2812.5 W for class-A and 2 W for class-B devices as per spec-
iﬁcation [11]
29For AIS, a λ/4 antenna measures 46 cm of length. Lambda
corresponds to the wavelength (i.e., c/162 MHz.)
on September 2013 the aﬀected providers30 and involved
standards organizations31. At the time of writing, we re-
ceived positive feedback from Marine Traﬃc and Vessel Finder,
and we are actively collaborating with IMO and ITU-R –
The latest informed us that they will consider enhancements
to AIS, in terms of security, at the World Radiocommuni-
cation Conference in 2015. We also shared our concerns
with selected CERTs and coastguards, which are interested
in discussing the problems with us, standards organizations
and vendors.
In addition, we propose and share the following possible
mitigation strategies.
Anomaly Detection This strategy consists of applying anomaly
detection techniques to AIS data collected, e.g. by online
providers and vessel traﬃc services, in order to detect suspi-
cious activities like unexpected changes in vessels’ route or
static information. In addition, AIS data can be correlated
with satellite information to ﬁnd incongruities, for example
the dimensions of a vessel. Although anomaly detection may
be valuable in data collection systems, it seems not a solu-
tion for transponders installations on vessels, which remain
vulnerable to RF-speciﬁc threats like availability disruption
and SART spooﬁng.
X.509 PKI A complementary form of mitigation consists
in adopting a public-key infrastructure schema in the AIS
protocol used in the RF communications. We suggest X.509 [9],
a well-known PKI standard, in which the digital certiﬁcates
are issued by oﬃcial national maritime authorities acting as
certiﬁcation authorities32 and conﬁgured in a transponder
concurrently with the other station’s identiﬁers, i.e. MMSI
and call-sign. X.509 provides authentication on messages ex-
changed among stations, e.g. between ships and with port
authorities. The certiﬁcates are handled in two forms: cer-
tiﬁcates belonging to noteworthy stations like VTSs are pre-
loaded via onshore installations, e.g. when a ship enters a
port; generic certiﬁcates and certiﬁcates previously unknown
to a station are exchanged with nearby stations (i.e., vessels
in navigation) on demand, during the acquaintance phase
of two vessels33. Vessels with satellite Internet access can
additionally retrieve the certiﬁcates from online services.
8. RELATED WORK
A large body of literature focuses on correlating and ana-
lyzing ships information collected from vessel traﬃc services
and online providers. Xianbiao et al. in [14] use online an-
alytical processing (OLAP) to store, process and correlate
information for collision avoidance and investigation. The
same authors discuss in [20] diﬀerent techniques to organize
AIS-collected data in an eﬃcient manner. Carthel et al.
in [4] research on multi-sensor networks for data surveillance.
They suggest to extend DMHT tracking, an algorithm orig-
inally designed for undersea surveillance networks, to AIS.
Similarly, authors in [24] suggest ways to increase the mar-
itime domain awareness (MDA) by collecting and using AIS
data. Other applications consist of correlating oil slick shape

31IMO, IALA and ITU-R
32The same organizations issuing MMSI and call-sign identi-
ﬁers for AIS stations, e.g. the US Coast Guard or the Italian
Ministry of Economic Development
33There is no need to exchange the certiﬁcates over trusted
channels because counterfeiting will invalidate them

and tracking data to identify ships illegally spilling oil in the
sea [1] and of predicting the ﬁnancial gain given by commer-
cial trading [17]. With respect to navigational safety, most
of the literature focuses on collision-avoidance systems and
prevention, for example as reported in [15] and [16].
Despite the large body of AIS research, and to the best of
our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to conduct a security evalua-
tion of the automatic identiﬁcation system. We use software-
deﬁned-radio to build a novel AIS transmitter, namely AISTX,
and to show that our concerns are real. With respect to ex-
isting AIS receivers, we report [8], [18], [22], and [25]. Both
gr-ais [8] and ais-tool [25] are software-based receivers built
on top of GnuRadio.
In particular, we used gr-ais in the
hybrid receiver introduced in our radio-frequency evalua-
tion. When compared with Guarnieri [6], our work looks
at faults in the AIS’s implementation and protocol speciﬁ-
cation, while his work focuses on data leaked from AIS data
collected in Internet Census 201234.
Similarly to our research in smart transportation, Costin
et al. [7] perform a security evaluation of ADS-B35, a radio-
frequency protocol used in aviation for data communication
and monitoring. Using software-deﬁned-radio, they show
that ADS-B is vulnerable to eavesdropping, message jam-
ming and replaying of injection. In a similar work, Teso [23]
shows how to use ACARS36 to upload malicious ﬂight man-
agement system (FMS) plans to aircraft. More recently,
Humphreys et al.
in [21] introduce a software-based GPS
transmitter to fool GPS communication and demonstrate
how to hijack valid GPS signals to bring a ship oﬀ course.
9. CONCLUSIONS
AIS is a cyber-physical system commonly used in the ma-
rine industry for vessels traﬃc monitoring and assistance.
Given its importance in collision detection, search and res-
cue operations and piracy prevention, we conducted a unique
security evaluation of AIS. Using a software-based transmit-
ter that we introduced, we discovered and experimentally
proved that both the AIS’s implementation and the pro-
tocol speciﬁcation are aﬀected by several threats, oﬀering
malicious actors many attack possibilities. We did responsi-
ble disclosure and notiﬁed upfront with mitigation strategies
the aﬀected providers and involved international organiza-
tions, with which we are currently and actively collaborating
in order to improve the overall security. We hope that our
research will help in this direction.
