### Introduction

We identified two critical points in our simulation where specific modifications were necessary: when observing an ACK (since the ACK may be part of a MAC-level fragmented packet) and when observing a CTS. We adjusted our simulation to incorporate these limits, assuming a maximum packet size of 1500 bytes. Although this is not the absolute largest packet size in an 802.11 network, it is the largest size typically used in practice because 802.11 networks are often bridged to Ethernet, which has an MTU of approximately 1500 bytes.

### Simulation Results

Figure 9 illustrates the simulation of this defense under the same conditions as the previous simulation. Despite significant perturbation, many individual sessions were able to make successful forward progress. However, we found that by increasing the attacker's frequency to 90 packets per second, the network could still be shut down. This occurs because the attacker uses ACK frames, whose impact on the NAV is limited by the high cap.

### Improving the Defense

To further improve the defense, we need to modify certain aspects of the standard 802.11 MAC functionality. The core issue is the inherent trust that nodes place in the duration values sent by other nodes. By reinterpreting the duration values in different frame types—ACK, data, RTS, and CTS—we can mitigate most possible DoS attacks.

#### ACK Frames

Under normal circumstances, an ACK frame should carry a large duration value only when it is part of a fragmented packet sequence, reserving the medium for the next fragment. Since fragmentation is rarely used (due to default thresholds exceeding the Ethernet MTU), removing it from operation will have minimal impact on existing networks.

#### Data Frames

Similarly, a data frame should carry a large duration value only if it is a subframe in a fragmented packet exchange. With fragmentation removed, we can safely ignore the duration values in all data frames.

#### RTS Frames

The RTS frame is valid only in an RTS-CTS-data transmission sequence. If an RTS is observed, the node seeing the RTS will also observe the subsequent data frame. The 802.11 specification defines the exact timing for the CTS and data frames. Therefore, the duration value in the RTS packet can be treated speculatively—respected until the expected time for the data frame. If the data frame is not observed, either the sender is out of range or the RTS request was spoofed. In either case, the node can safely undo the impact of the duration on the NAV. This interpretation is allowed under the existing 802.11 standards.

#### CTS Frames

If a lone CTS frame is observed, there are two possibilities: the CTS frame was unsolicited, or the observing node is a hidden terminal. If the unsolicited CTS is addressed to a valid, in-range node, the node can respond with a null function packet containing a zero duration value, effectively neutralizing the attack. However, if the CTS is addressed to a nonexistent or out-of-range node, it is indistinguishable from a legitimate hidden terminal, and there is insufficient information for a legitimate node to act.

### Mitigating Unsolicited CTS Attacks

An imperfect but practical approach is to allow each node to independently choose to ignore lone CTS packets as the fraction of time stalled on such requests increases. Setting this threshold at 30 percent will provide normal operation in most legitimate environments while preventing an attacker from claiming more than a third of the bandwidth using this attack.

### Additional Considerations

Existing 802.11 implementations use different receive and carrier-sense thresholds. In an open area, the interference radius of a node is approximately double its transmit radius. In the hidden terminal case, although the hidden terminal cannot receive the data being transmitted, it still detects a busy medium and will not generate traffic that would interfere with the data, making the possibility of an unsolicited CTS followed by an undetectable data packet very low.

### Long-Term Solutions

The ultimate solution to this problem is to extend explicit authentication to 802.11 control packets. Each client-generated CTS packet should contain a fresh and cryptographically signed copy of the originating RTS. If every client shares keying material with all surrounding access points, it is possible to authenticate lone CTS requests directly. However, such a modification is a significant alteration to the existing 802.11 standard, and its benefits relative to costs are unclear. In the meantime, the system-level defenses described provide reasonable protection with low implementation overhead and no management burden.

### Conclusion

802.11-based networks have seen widespread deployment due to the convenience of radio-based communication. This deployment relies on user expectations of confidentiality and availability. This paper addresses the availability aspect by examining the 802.11 MAC layer and identifying vulnerabilities that can be exploited to deny service to legitimate users. We described software infrastructure for generating arbitrary 802.11 frames using commodity hardware and implemented versions of deauthentication and virtual carrier-sense attacks. We found that the former attack is highly effective in practice, while the latter is only a theoretical vulnerability due to implementation deficiencies in commodity 802.11 gear. We also described and analyzed potential countermeasures, which represent a stopgap measure that can be implemented with low overhead on existing hardware but not a long-term substitute for per-packet authentication mechanisms. Overall, this paper underscores the care needed when deploying 802.11 networks in mission-critical applications.
