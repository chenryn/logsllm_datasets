in two places: when observing an ACK (because the
ACK my be part of a MAC level fragmented packet)
and when observing a CTS.
We modiﬁed our simulation to add these limits,
assuming that a value of 1500 bytes as the largest
packet. While this is not strictly the largest packet
that can be sent in an 802.11 network,
it is the
largest packet sent in practice because 802.11 net-
works are typically bridged to Ethernet, which has
a roughly 1500 byte MTU. Figure 9 shows a simula-
tion of this defense under the same conditions as the
prior simulation. While there is still signiﬁcant per-
turbation, many of the individual sessions are able
to make successful forward progress. However, we
found that simply by increasing the attacker’s fre-
quency to 90 packets per second, the network could
still be shut down. This occurs because the attacker
is using ACK frames, whose impact on the NAV is
limited by the high cap.
To further improve upon this result requires us
to abandon portions of the standard 802.11 MAC
functionality. At issue is the inherent trust that
nodes place in the duration value sent by other
nodes. By considering the diﬀerent frame types that

carry duration values we can deﬁne a new interpre-
tation of the duration that allows us to avoid most
possible DoS attacks. The four key frame types that
contain duration values are ACK, data, RTS, and
CTS, and we consider each in turn.
Under normal circumstances the only time a
ACK frame should carry a large duration value is
when the ACK is part of a fragmented packet se-
quence.
In this case the ACK is reserving the
medium for the next fragment. If fragmentation is
not used then there is no reason to respect the dura-
tion value contained in ACK frames. Since fragmen-
tation is almost never used (largely due to the fact
that default fragmentation thresholds signiﬁcantly
exceed the Ethernet MTU) removing it from opera-
tion altogether will have minimal impact on existing
networks.
Like the ACK frame, the only legitimate occa-
sion a data frame can carry a large duration value is
if it is a subframe in a fragmented packet exchange.
Since we have removed fragmentation from the net-
work, we can safely ignore the duration values in all
data frames.
The third frame type to be concerned with is
the RTS frame. The RTS frame is only valid in an
RTS-CTS-data transmission sequence. If an RTS is
seen on the network, it follows that the node seeing
the RTS will also be able to observe the data frame.
The 802.11 speciﬁcation precisely deﬁnes the time
a CTS frame, and subsequent data frame, will be
sent. Therefore the duration value in the RTS packet
can be treated speculatively – respected until such
time as a data frame should be sent.
If the data
frame is not observed at the correct time, either the
sender has moved out of range or the RTS request
was spoofed. In either case it is safe for the other
node to undo the impact of this duration on the
NAV. This interpretation is, in fact, allowed under
the existing 802.11 standards.
The last frame to consider is the CTS frame. If
a lone CTS frame is observed there are two possibili-
ties: the CTS frame was unsolicited or the observing
node is a hidden terminal. These are the only two
cases possible, since if the observing node was not
a hidden terminal it would have heard the original
RTS frame and it would be handled accordingly. If
the unsolicited CTS is addressed to a valid, in-range
node, then only the valid node knows the CTS is
bogus. It can prevent this attack by responding to
such a CTS with a null function packet containing a
zero duration value – eﬀectively undoing the attack-
ers channel reservation. However, if an unsolicited
CTS is addressed to a nonexistent node, or a node
out of radio range, this is indistinguishable from a
legitimate hidden terminal. In this case, there is in-
suﬃcient information for a legitimate node to act.
The node issuing the CTS could be an attacker, or
they may simply be responding to a legitimate RTS
request that is beyond the radio range of the ob-
server.
An imperfect approach to this ﬁnal situation, is
to allow each node to independently choose to ignore
lone CTS packets as the fraction of time stalled on
such requests increases. Since hidden terminals are

Figure 9: Results from the ACK based virtual carrier-sense attack simulation with 18 client nodes modiﬁed

a not a signiﬁcant eﬃciency problem in most net-
works (as evidenced by the fact that RTS/CTS are
rarely employed and since the underlying functional-
ity does not seem to work in many implementations)
setting this threshold at 30 percent, will provide nor-
mal operation in most legitimate environments, but
will prevent an attacker from claiming more than a
third of the bandwidth using this attack.
It should also be noted that existing 802.11 im-
plementations use diﬀerent receive and carrier-sense
thresholds. The diﬀerent values are such that, in
an open area, the interference radius of a node is
approximately double its transmit radius.
In the
hidden terminal case this means that although the
hidden terminal can not receive the data being trans-
mitted, it still detects a busy medium and will not
generate any traﬃc that would interfere with the
data, so the possibility of an unsolicited CTS fol-
lowed by an undetectable data packet is very low.
But ultimately the only foolproof solution to
this problem is to extend explicit authentication to
802.11 control packets. Each client-generated CTS
packet contains an implicit claim that it was sent in
response to a legitimate RTS generated by an ac-
cess point. However, to prove this claim, the CTS
frame must contain a fresh and cryptographically
signed copy of the originating RTS. If every client
shares keying material with all surrounding access
points it is then possible to authenticate lone CTS
requests directly. However, such a modiﬁcation is
a signiﬁcant alternation to the existing 802.11 stan-
dard, and it is unclear if it oﬀers suﬃcient beneﬁts
relative to its costs. In the meantime, the system-
level defenses we have described provide reasonable
degrees of protection with extremely low implemen-
tation overhead and no management burden. Should
media-access based denial-of-service attacks become
prevalent, these solutions could be deployed quickly
with little eﬀort.
5 Conclusion
802.11-based networks have seen widespread de-
ployment across many ﬁelds, mainly due to the
physical conveniences of radio-based communica-
tion. This deployment, however, was predicated in
part on the user expectation of conﬁdentiality and
availability. This paper addressed the availability
aspect of that equation. We examined the 802.11
MAC layer and identiﬁed a number of vulnerabili-
ties that could be exploited to deny service to legiti-
mate users. We described software infrastructure for
generating arbitrary 802.11 frames using commodity
hardware and then used this platform to implement
versions of the deauthentication and virtual carrier-
sense attacks. We found that the former attack
was highly eﬀective in practice, while the latter is
only a theoretical vulnerability due to implementa-
tion deﬁciencies in commodity 802.11 gear. In addi-
tion to demonstrating the attacks, we described and
analyzed potential countermeasures. These counter-
measures represent a stopgap measure, one that can
be implemented with low overhead on existing hard-

ware, but not a long term substitute for appropriate
per-packet authentication mechanisms. Overall, we
believe this paper helps to underscore the care that
must be taken when deploying 802.11 networks in
mission critical applications.
