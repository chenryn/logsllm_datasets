### Abstract
The 95th percentile billing mechanism has been an industry de facto standard for transit providers for over a decade. While its simplicity is appealing, the dramatic evolution in traffic patterns, interconnection practices, and industry structure over the past two decades raises the question of its continued appropriateness. In this paper, we evaluate the 95th percentile pricing mechanism from the perspective of transit providers using a decade of traffic statistics from SWITCH (a large research/academic network) and more recent data from three Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). Our findings indicate that over time, heavy-inbound and heavy-hitter networks achieve a lower 95th-to-average ratio than heavy-inbound and moderate-hitter networks, possibly due to better traffic management. The 95th percentile traffic volume does not necessarily reflect the cost burden to the provider, leading us to explore alternative metrics that better capture these costs. We introduce the provision ratio, which measures a customer's contribution to the provider's peak load.

## 1. Introduction
The 95th percentile billing method is the industry standard for transit billing [1, 2]. This method involves measuring the utilization of a customer link in 5-minute intervals over a month and then computing the 95th percentile of these values as the billing volume. The 95th percentile method has several advantages: it is simple to implement, uses readily available data (e.g., SNMP), and approximates the load caused by a customer while forgiving occasional bursts (the top 5% of samples are ignored).

Despite its long-standing use, traffic patterns have evolved significantly, from client-server dominance to the rise and fall of peer-to-peer applications and the advent of streaming video. Given that a transit customer's traffic profile depends on the popularity of underlying applications, it is uncertain whether a billing scheme that was rational a decade ago remains appropriate today.

In this work, we reassess the 95th percentile billing scheme from the provider's perspective to determine if it still achieves its intended goal of providing an easy-to-compute approximation of a customer's traffic load. We use 10 years of historical data from SWITCH, a Swiss research/academic network, and recent data from three IXPs to investigate how the 95th percentile of a customer's traffic relates to:
1. Total traffic volume,
2. Predominantly inbound/outbound nature,
3. Behavior as a heavy vs. moderate hitter.

We also examine the fairness of the 95th percentile scheme and introduce a new metric, the provision ratio, to explore the relationship between the 95th percentile of a customer's traffic and their contribution to the provider's traffic load.

Our analysis reveals that over the years, customers with predominantly outbound traffic profiles maintain a lower 95th-to-average ratio than predominantly inbound customers, resulting in lower billing volumes for the same amount of traffic. Additionally, the 95th percentile pricing mechanism can be unfair, as it may not accurately reflect the cost burden to the provider, especially when there is little overlap between the customer's peak and the overall (provider) peak traffic. These results suggest the need to explore alternatives to the 95th percentile billing method that can better approximate a customer's cost burden without adding significant measurement or computational overhead.

## 2. Datasets
### SWITCH Dataset
Our first dataset comes from SWITCH, a Swiss research/academic network that provides Internet connectivity to major universities and organizations in Switzerland. SWITCH connects about 50 research and education sites, acting as a transit provider for traffic originating from or destined to these networks. It also provides connectivity to the public Internet via commercial providers and hosts content caches for two large content providers. For traffic billing, SWITCH measures the utilization of each border router interface in both inbound and outbound directions in 5-minute intervals. We use historical datasets from January 2003 to December 2012 for our longitudinal analysis.

### IXP Dataset
The second dataset consists of traffic statistics published by three Internet Exchange Points (IXPs): Budapest Internet Exchange (BIX), Slovak Internet Exchange (SIX), and Interlan Internet Exchange (ILAN). These IXPs publish MRTG graphs with 5-minute utilization (inbound and outbound) for each network connected to the public peering fabric of the IXP. We collected these graphs daily for August 2013 and used Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools [3] to parse them. BIX had 62 networks, SIX had 48, and ILAN had 55 networks connected to their public peering fabrics. Networks connect to IXPs to create (settlement-free) peering connections with other participating networks, so the traffic statistics at an IXP represent a connected network's peering traffic. Castro et al. [3] showed that transit and peering traffic have similar diurnal patterns and peak-to-valley ratios; in fact, transit traffic can be well-approximated as a multiplicative factor of peering traffic. In our analysis, we consider the IXP as a proxy for a transit provider and the networks connected to it as its customers.

## 3. Longitudinal Study of 95th Percentile Billing
### 3.1 Calculation of 95th Percentile
Although 95th percentile billing is the industry standard, there are two common implementations:
1. **Method 1**: Measures inbound and outbound traffic in 5-minute intervals over the month, calculates the 95th percentile for each direction, and uses the maximum of these two values. Most transit providers use this method [5, 6].
2. **Method 2**: Records the maximum of inbound and outbound traffic in each 5-minute interval and calculates the 95th percentile from the resulting dataset. This method is less common but is used by some providers [7, 8].

Method 2 will yield a value greater than or equal to Method 1, and the results will differ significantly for customers with balanced traffic profiles but with inbound and outbound peaks occurring at different times. We computed the 95th percentile for each network in the SWITCH dataset over 10 years. The median ratio of the 95th percentile value for each network, computed using these two methods, is close to 1, but the widest difference can induce a 20% higher transit bill using Method 2.

### 3.2 Classification of Networks
#### Direction of Traffic
We classify networks into three categories based on the dominant direction of traffic:
- **Heavy-Inbound**: Inbound traffic is more than twice the outbound traffic.
- **Heavy-Outbound**: Outbound traffic is more than twice the inbound traffic.
- **Balanced**: Neither condition is met.

Content providers are typically heavy-outbound, while eyeball providers are heavy-inbound.

#### Volume of Traffic
We classify networks based on the volume of traffic they generate/consume over a month into:
- **Heavy-Hitter Networks**: Top 20% of networks contributing 80-90% of total traffic in the SWITCH dataset and 75% in the IXP dataset.
- **Moderate-Hitter Networks**: Remaining networks.

### 3.3 95th Percentile to Average Ratio
For each customer network, we evaluate the 95th percentile to average traffic ratio. The average reflects the total volume of traffic, while the 95th percentile gives an idea of the peak and is the traffic volume for which the customer is billed. If these values significantly differ, it suggests that the customer is paying primarily for burstiness.

Figure 1 shows the mean 95th percentile to average traffic ratio over time for networks in the SWITCH dataset, classified by traffic direction and volume. The 95th percentile to average ratio has been fairly stable over the years for each type of network, despite changes in overall inter-domain traffic patterns. In the last 4 years, the mean ratio for heavy-outbound networks is between 2 and 3, while for heavy-inbound networks, it is between 3.25 and 4. For balanced networks, the ratio is less than 3.25. Therefore, heavy-inbound networks generally have higher 95th percentile traffic compared to heavy-outbound or balanced networks for the same average traffic, resulting in higher billing volumes.

Table 1 shows the mean 95th percentile to average ratio for different classes of networks in the IXP dataset. The mean ratio is higher for heavy-inbound networks than for heavy-outbound networks, consistent with our analysis of the SWITCH dataset. With the exception of BIX, the mean 95th percentile to average ratio for networks at the other two IXPs is larger for moderate-hitter networks than for heavy-hitter networks, indicating that moderate-hitter networks have a burstier traffic profile.

### 3.4 Skewness of the Traffic Distribution
Our analysis shows that heavy-inbound and moderate-hitter networks have a higher 95th-to-average ratio compared to other networks, meaning their traffic is more bursty. Figure 2 illustrates the skewness of the traffic distribution for different network types over time.

## Conclusion
The 95th percentile billing mechanism, while simple and widely adopted, may no longer be the most appropriate method for all transit providers. Heavy-inbound and moderate-hitter networks, in particular, may benefit from alternative billing schemes that better reflect their traffic characteristics and cost burdens. The provision ratio, introduced in this study, offers a potential alternative metric for more accurate and fair billing. Further research is needed to explore and validate such alternatives.
