Question: "In a Java Server Page (JSP) application, a developer included a comment within the JSP code saying '<!-- FIXME: calling this with more than 30 args kills the JDBC server -->'. What is the potential security implication of this practice?"
 "A": "It provides documentation for future maintenance and has no security implications."
 "B": "It could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker discovers the comment and abuses the vulnerability."
 "C": "The comment will be pre-processed by the server and thus poses no risk of information exposure."
 "D": "Such comments increase the application's response time and may slow down the server."
Answer: B
