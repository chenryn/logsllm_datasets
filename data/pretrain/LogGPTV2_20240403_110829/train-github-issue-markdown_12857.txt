### Input Code
    callee(castee: CastTo)
### Babel Configuration (.babelrc, package.json, cli command)
Babylon with `flow` plugin enabled. Appears to affect both Babylon 6 and 7.
### Expected Behavior
Both the Flow docs (https://flow.org/en/docs/types/casting/) and the Flow
parser flag this as a parse error.  
The Flow parser says `Unexpected token :` at line 1, column 13
It should be necessary to wrap type casts in explicit `( )`, so e.g.
`callee((castee: CastTo))`.
### Current Behavior
Parses successfully leaving an AST like
    ExprStmt( CallExpression( callee, TypeCastExpression( castee, CastTo ) ) )
### Possible Solution
I am working on a patch here: wcjohnson/babylon-lightscript@`322842a`
The patch is against a heavily modified Babylon but may be useful nonetheless.
The basic idea is to parse as `TypeCastish` and then convert back to
`TypeCastExpression` only during `parseParenAndDistinguishExpression`. Any
time a `TypeCastish` is seen outside of there, throw an unexpected type cast
error.
### Context
I work on the LightScript language, which uses a fork of Babylon as its
parser. The LightScript issue that led to this issue is here:
wcjohnson/lightscript#22
