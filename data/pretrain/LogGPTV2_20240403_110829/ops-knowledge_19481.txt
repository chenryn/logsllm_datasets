User: From what I understand, the parent attribute of a db.Model (typically defined/passed in the constructor call) allows you to define hierarchies in your data models. As a result, this increases the size of the entity group. However, it's not very clear to me why we would want to do that. Is this strictly for ACID compliance? I would like to see scenarios where each is best suited or more appropriate.
Assistant: There are several differences:

All entities with the same ancestor are in the same entity group. Transactions can only affect entities inside a single entity group.
All writes to a single entity group are serialized, so throughput is limited.
The parent entity is set on creation and is fixed. References can be changed at any time.
With reference properties, you can only query for direct relationships, but with parent properties you can use the .ancestor() filter to find everything (directly or indirectly) descended from a given ancestor.
Each entity has only a single parent, but can have multiple reference properties.
