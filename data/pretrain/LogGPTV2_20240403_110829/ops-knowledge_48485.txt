User: With Windows named pipes, what is the proper way to use the CreateNamedPipe, ConnectNamedPipe, DisconnectNamedPipe, and CloseHandle calls?
I am making a server app which is connecting to a client app which connects and disconnects to the pipe multiple times across a session.
When my writes fail because the client disconnected, should I call DisconnectNamedPipe, CloseHandle, or nothing on my handle.
Then, to accept a new connection, should I call CreateNamedPipe and then ConnectNamedPipe, or just ConnectNamedPipe?
I would very much like an explanation of the different states my pipe can be in as a result of these calls, because I have not found this elsewhere.
Additional info: 
Language: Python using the win32pipe,win32file and win32api libraries.
Pipe settings: WAIT, no overlap, bytestream.
Assistant: I have managed to achieve what I wanted. I call CreateNamedPipe and CloseHandle exactly once per session, and I call DisconnectNamedPipe when my write fails, followed by another ConnectNamedPipe. 
The trick is to only call DisconnectNamedPipe when the pipe was actually connected. I called it every time I tried to connect "just to be sure" and it gave me strange errors.
