Over a year ago, we had the `kubernetes-build` job down <5m. It's now coming
in at 30m. Some of that shot up really recently, too, looking at the build
time trend:

It looks like sometime around #10384, we shot up from a fat 20m another 50% to
30m. Can we at least eliminate that jump?
Is there anything else we can do here? Maybe split the non-`amd64` builds off
to a separate job so that our whole CI infrastructure isn't tied to them?
