**User:**
I am looking for a solution to disable and enable a specific device in a Windows system using `devcon.exe` within a Python script. I can already perform these actions using `devcon.exe` in the Windows Command Prompt, but I need to automate this process in a Python script to verify it over 10 iterations. Specifically, I need to automate a test case that will continuously disable and enable a particular device using `devcon.exe` for 10 iterations and record the results in a log.

**Assistant:**
Thank you for your query. Your requirement can be achieved using the `subprocess` module in Python. This module allows you to run external commands, such as `devcon.exe`, from within your Python script. 

If you are unable to find the necessary information or need further assistance, please let me know, and I will provide a sample code to help you get started. Thank you!
