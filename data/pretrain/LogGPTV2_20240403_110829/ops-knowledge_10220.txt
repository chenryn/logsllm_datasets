User: I am looking for solution, I want to disable/enable the particular device in windows system using devcon.exe in python script.
I am able to disable/enable using devcon.exe windows cmd.exe separately but i am looking for this activity to done using python script to verify 10 iteration.
I need to automate one test case which will has to verify the disabling/enabling particular device in windows using devcon.exe for 10 iteration continuously and record log.
Assistant: I know this is very late. But your problem can be solved by the subprocess module. Let me know if you are unable to find what you need, and I will then post the code. Thanks
