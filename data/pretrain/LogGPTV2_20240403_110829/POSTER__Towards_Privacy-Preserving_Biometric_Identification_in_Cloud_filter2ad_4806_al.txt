be matched to a template. This cascade eﬀect happens due to dysfunctional false
acceptance rates of a system that make it vulnerable. Obfuscation intents are
carried out without the requirement of advanced technical skills, by presenting a
counterfeited stolen, copied, replicated biometric and the range includes gummy
ﬁngerprints, photos, three dimensional-3D shaped models or falsiﬁcation of
facial characteristics using make-up, plastic surgery, imitations or short video
clips for gait, signature or handwriting, recorded speech modality and voice
conversion, high resolution pictures of iris or even ears. To sum up, sophisticated
cheaters have constantly managed to artistically fool the most smart computer
devices simply by taking the advantage of the increasing popularity of social
network websites where photographs are available, such as facebook, instagram,
youtube etc.
Research has proved that none scheme is completely spoof-proof, since almost
all commercial devices by private security ﬁrms are defeated after this kind
of attack. However, the issue is not about the hacked systems but people and
this is a particular challenge, not only in criminal, but also in civil matters.
The implications are gradually increased across diﬀerent devices and public
services. Depending on the position of the attack, recently published works have
COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW
73
managed to categorize and evaluate them with regards to the scores of rates that
a system can demonstrate when it is threaten. Insuﬃcient, sub-optimal, optimal
and super-optimal attacks constitute the terminology for spooﬁng acts [51].
From an ethical perspective, a deceiver can claim an identity and gain access to
private data or parallel information that may lead him/her to someone’s car,
mobile, computer, house, electronic passport, totally ruining a personality in
society. A decade ago, all these would be heard like a myth or seen as a movie
scenario, nevertheless, nowadays persons may well consider such information
intimate and part of a broadly acceptable status quo, and hence demand a
vigilance attitude from companies and authorities, with skeptical position against
any alarming behavior could threaten their interests. Undoubtedly, it remains
really hard for nonspecialists to assess the security-low-level parts of a system
and perfectly compose their plan, but still there is the belief about those who if
they are motivated will ﬁnd an idea on how to get around any barriers used to
protect the targeted system [136]. To overcome these arguments, applications
should be designed following the security level needed according to its potential
purpose, the scale of the data and concurrently follow privacy by design rules,
covering the ISO Standards, respecting legal provisions.
3.2 Anti-Spooﬁng Measures
Up to this point, in research community diﬀerent methods have been suggested
for facing this long-neglected problem against many biometric modes, referred
as anti-spooﬁng, spoof detection or presentation attack detection. By deﬁnition,
their role is to confer a highly positive characterization about system’s
trustworthiness [176]. In this way, the major objective is to ensure the protected
environment of an application which can recognize only genuine users and not
detect and prevent spooﬁng attacks, as is mistakenly believed. Having this
in mind, the questions about the huge chasm between research results and
real-world applications can be answered [60]. Minding the gap, the technology
of a biometric veriﬁcation system should contain by design the incorporation of
mechanisms that reject spooﬁng attacks and are under alliance with the parts
of the ﬁnal system considerations and characterize its overall susceptibility.
One the most familiar and user-comfort technique that is used for increasing
the awkwardness to spoof a system are passwords or smart cards, oﬀering the
opportunity for supervising the veriﬁcation process. Although the way has been
successfully, at some percentage, practiced on transactions, other recognition
applications that require communication between services and enrolled person,
such as travelers’ checks, need other anti-spooﬁng methods, involving the
combination of multimodal biometrics for one identity and liveness detection.
74 A BIMODAL VERIFICATION CRYPTOSYSTEM AS A FRAMEWORK AGAINST SPOOFING ATTACKS
Human physiologic information do not indicate that the person who is present at
the time of capture is actually alive. Liveness detection tests some data inherent
to the biometric or additional processing of information captured by reader
to extract contextual, discriminating features or extra hardware. On the same
wavelength, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, palm vein, keystroke, typing
rhythm, gait, ear acoustic properties, ﬁnger/hand temperature sensing, facial
thermograms as continuous authentication mechanisms and challenge/response
actions describe the cooperation of the user who provides unintentionally or
must do something, a blink, pupil, lip or head movement, allowing the system
to understand his/her real presence.
Algorithms, recently proposed countermeasures, standards, protocols and
recorded DBs for further analysis have received upsurge attention, with varying
degrees of spooﬁng vulnerability, covering a range of attack scenarios and
acquisition conditions [168]. Methods are classiﬁed in three categories, ﬁrstly, a
real living body possess color, texture, elasticity and supplementary intrinsic
properties, which can be used to check the validity, human expressions, reﬂex
and involuntary signals are secondly grouped. Finally, coming from traditional
forensic environments, the collected trait is examined for spotting clues of forgery
of friction ridge skin clarity. Academic and industrial projects choose the baseline,
plot the licit/normal scenarios and the error rates criteria for the experiments,
conducting on freely datasets, available for oﬄine work, containing samples
for diﬀerent modalities. Among the most “overused” evaluated biometrics are
ﬁngerprints, iris and face, due to their widely accepted distinctiveness [136].
Respectively, face presentation potential can be handled by subject-speciﬁc 3D
facial masks which analyze local binary patterns based measures. A powerful
way to eliminate similar threats are the background motion correlation and
texture of the surrounding facial region quality measurements, something that
could be useful especially to more realistic scenarios [81]. For ﬁngerprints,
algorithms that can perform an analysis about the capture of multiple samples
of a biometric instance in a short time frame are combined with those that
allow live detection and segmentation of the ﬁnger, including defenses against
gelatin, gummy and silicon samples and others that oﬀer processing of the photo
with graphical operations, enabling a convenient thought about how to capture
multiple views of modality from diﬀerent ﬁngers of one subject. The results prove
well-promising rates, even though the existence of a purely incapable of being
deceived climate system is simply a utopia, under the current circumstances. A
novel multi-spectral approach to manage these challenges is to use the proposed
cascade structures as a part of a larger anti-spooﬁng solution that involves
multiple modalities from the user, his/her movements to justify the presence,
algorithms that overcome the noises, simulate light reﬂections, determine the
scene motion, ﬁxations, speed, acceleration, or even anticipate video replay
MUTLIBIOMETRIC CRYPTOSYSTEMS

attacks. The developments may be evaluated through test protocols, applied to
more comprehensive DBs, and meanwhile the techniques should to be based on
speciﬁc frameworks, supporting larger scales of datasets and each generalization
need to be carefully controlled.
4 Mutlibiometric Cryptosystems
4.1 Attacks
The technologies of multi or single biometric cryptosystems have been
encountered to inﬁltrate systems, preventing from some malicious performances,
while remain exposed to classic spooﬁng ones. Brieﬂy, it is pointed out that
a skillful adversary has to know additional transform parameters or secret
keys to defeat the area with previously enrolled samples, since both categories
used to cooperate with helper data or are bound to cryptographic techniques
and tokens. In such a condition, reconstruction of the original template, and
consequently its raw usage or the synthesization of fake physical biometrics, is
greatly complicated. The multimodalities for one identity oﬀer the advantage
of extremely low false acceptance attacks in a tampering hypothesis. On the
contrary, if a single trait is compromised then the whole template can be
recovered, when a blended replacement attack take place, where subject and
attacker’s template and distinct parts of larger sets are merged into one [9].
Cancelable approaches transform non-invertibly can unlock the genuine user’s
biometric or some elements of it respectively, as described in [120]. Fuzzy
commitment schemes and vaults, which are related to entropy rates and wittily
hiding the biometric (for instance minutiae and chaﬀ points for ﬁngerprints), are
vulnerable if the algorithms are poor. Helper data and key-re-generation schemes
extracting short keys or suﬀering from improper accuracy present high tolerance,
making achievable the composition of an approximation of the initial biometric
from its hashes. Coercitive, device substitution intrusions and any possible
combination of serial venomous acts could be applied suﬃciently, compounding
a worst possible scenario, but rather unrealistic in everyday contexts.
Since it still remains necessary to test the robustness of multimodal biometric
systems, especially for combinations, such as face-ﬁngerprint or/and face-iris,
under various realistic hypotheses, recent studies such as the work in [9]
conducted some experiments. This analysis may allow ﬁguring out to what
extent each balanced countermeasure is representative of the performance.
The relevant endeavor was based on established state-of-the-art authentication
technologies for each modality and diﬀerent combinations of attacking story
76 A BIMODAL VERIFICATION CRYPTOSYSTEM AS A FRAMEWORK AGAINST SPOOFING ATTACKS
lines using datasets of spoofed templates or traits. The ﬁnal comments led us to
the denouement that multimodal schemes suﬀer from lack of unsuitable strong
protection for their template, as the design of optimized fusion rules is currently
under research. At the very least, attacking assumptions are too pessimistic
and result in a signiﬁcant overestimation of the false acceptance rates, a case
that turned out to be positively reassuring, but certainly non-eﬀective for more
advanced and elaborate intrusions.
4.2 Resistance
Response-focused methodology on the basis of possibility to integrate liveness
detection or the mentioned anti-spooﬁng methods include experimental
investigations to verify whether and to what extent multimodal veriﬁcation
systems could be assessed as securely protected. Until now, studies on spooﬁng
underline that using multibiometrics, the recognition performance is higher but
unfortunately unimodal approaches handle better external attacks [76,137]. To
reduce the risk of exposure of the combined template, if a single trait revealed,
the selection of other biometrics, akin to hand-ﬁngerprint, face-iris, instead of
multiple ﬁngerprint samples, for example, is recommended, based on empirical
evidences. For increasing robustness, the design of stronger fusion rules (score
or feature level are recommended) between samples is mandatory. Additionally,
cryptosystems and especially crypto-bio keys ideas for multimodalities are not
only more eﬃcient than unimodal ones, but simultaneously privacy-friendly.
These suggestions pretend to bring some insight into the diﬃcult problem of
evaluation through the eﬀective countermeasures that can minimize the eﬀects
of threats by taking into consideration the techniques of fusion, the serial
or parallel modes, the type of cryptographic algorithms, complexion of the
application according to the hardware and its interconnects [9]. Finally, we
emphasize that any protection mechanism should respect design principles and
keep the overall balance of the system, without underestimating that extra
eﬀorts can bring about the cost of sharply reduction of veriﬁcation performance.
5 Bimodal Biometric Veriﬁcation System
People from dozens of nations have already acquired their new electronic passport
equipped with contactless chip that stores personal data. The expansion of
illegal occurrences in this area increases the lack of public trust with numerous
privacy, physical safety, and psychological comfort consequences [136,176]. As
a counterweight for the theoretical analysis of the previous sections, Figure 4
introduces a bimodal biometric model for person identiﬁcation made up of
BIMODAL BIOMETRIC VERIFICATION SYSTEM
77
face and ﬁngerprint, or face and iris matchers. The framework is a bold
initiative in the deployment of three technologies: crypto-biometrics, spooﬁng
countermeasures and Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID). This ePassport
idea is inspired by previous works on spooﬁng for biometrics [51] and designs
to defeat attacks through implementations of RFID authentication protocols
and data encryption, increasing the complexity and therefore robustness [104]
while cryptographically advocating the secrecy requirements for biometric data,
which is mandatory for identity documents schemes [106,191].
Figure 4: Flowchart of the bimodal system.
5.1 Functionality and Design
During the enrollment phase a pair of datasets is collected. To preserve the
principals for the protection of user’s privacy, the created template consists of
transformed minimal elements of the initial biometrics binded together under a
cryptographic algorithm which uses them to create keys. The extended version
of this deployment can be understood as this part was explained previously
78 A BIMODAL VERIFICATION CRYPTOSYSTEM AS A FRAMEWORK AGAINST SPOOFING ATTACKS
in Section 2. The scheme involves AD delivered from the involved hardware,
authority etc. The supplementary data in our design comes from the liveness
detection process. The ﬁnal non-biometric information stored on ePassport’s
chip are the crypto-bio key, which can be “unlocked” only when both biometrics
are matched, traveler’s personal details and document’s type, digital number,
etc.
The description of the anti-spooﬁng veriﬁcation system involves liveness
detection method combined with the current RFID access control process.
When a user approaches to an E-Gate for automatic passport checking, video
sequences are captured by its cameras. Then the system requires the cooperation
of person who has to turn left or right the head and provide his/her ﬁngerprint
to a sensor (or move eye to an iris movement tracker). The three dimensional
facial object as a result helps system to separate an alive human from a photo.
The matching parameters are scored under a fusion rule which its optimal
threshold depends on both of them, as a mechanism against multibiometric
template threats [9]. After judgment, the recognition procedure demands the
use of ﬁnal fusion score to extract from the DB (chip) the cryptographic key
and thus the informative content.
5.2 Usability and Advantages
Exploring the privacy and security usability of this method, authors respected
the needs of such an impending worldwide next-generation authentication
technology, as those were determined in admissible experiments [106]. The
framework preserves data conﬁdentiality as the initial biometric used for
enrollment and veriﬁcation or authentication is minimal and can be only available
for the creation of a protected template. The ﬁnal chip does not store fresh
biometric information and it is additionally transformed using one-way bit
functions. The re-generation or revocation of the pseudo-references as a privacy-
preserving mechanism for biometric protection may be an answer to lost identity
documents or compromised identities. This approach as a biometric template
mechanism could be also useful for many other applications. For example using
only identity cards or ePassports, if someone travels from one country to another,
for gaining access at his/her bank account [191]. The supporting architecture of
RFID protection mechanisms provides extra security for sensitive information,
such as birth date or nationality that are carried on passports.
Liveness detection as an anti-spooﬁng measure is nowadays among the most
acceptable ways against spooﬁng of identity documents, during border control
checks. The process can ensure the presence of the passport’s owner. Furthermore,
analyzing the result of sensor on a three subject-speciﬁc 3D facial trait with
BIMODAL BIOMETRIC VERIFICATION SYSTEM
79
local binary patterns and those data delivered after the cooperation of person,
iris movement tracking or presenting his/her ﬁngerprints, the system can be
smart enough to understand a genuine user or not.
The design requires the matching of many parameters that are scored under
fusion rules, as a more tested method for better results in modalities like those
used in our scheme. The optimal threshold depends on both of the strings
“unlocked” under the presence of its biometric characteristic, something that
can overcome the threat of exposure the whole template in multibiometric
template combinations [9]. The overall strings are cryptographically secured to
proof that the judgment during the recognition procedure will minimize the
false acceptance rates
Summarizing, this deployment deﬁnitely deserves a better analysis as it is just
the ﬁrst step of spooﬁng against next-generation identiﬁcation systems. The
encouraging part is the fact that this thought underlies on previously researches
that emphasize how important is to combine all the current knowledge in
cryptography to protect the biometric systems and the human rights to privacy.
The anti-spooﬁng methods based on the cooperation of machine-user add a
new layer to secure authentication, and relevant deployments after test and
evaluation can beneﬁt the needs of citizens, government and industry.
5.3 Vulnerabilities and Limitations
The vulnerabilities of this framework found on false acceptance percentages for
an impostor’s recognition and ingenious spooﬁng actions, under police presence
and could be considered as worst-case assumptions. ICAO and ISO standards
through documents that unequivocally identify their bearers were assumed
to guarantee the protection from the document forgery. RFID access control
processes and other impacts on security issues in ePassports, even though they
are a charming ﬁeld, are outside the scope of this paper.
As limitations of the design could be characterized the poor quality of the
cryptographic methodologies used in producing the template or/and score
fusion rules results. The function is time consuming, regarding that it performs
diﬀerent steps to provide a ﬁnal result. This is a signiﬁcant drawback considering
that it should be used as a method for border control with millions visitors
daily. The facial recognition as the ﬁrst and immutable part of this system
is weak during liveness detection performances as the result may vary if the
user moves the head fast, increasing the error rates. The ﬁngerprints present
shortcomings, as well, due to the fact that are aﬀected by age. Finally, the
use of PIs in such a scheme instead of crypto-biometric approaches has been
80 A BIMODAL VERIFICATION CRYPTOSYSTEM AS A FRAMEWORK AGAINST SPOOFING ATTACKS
implemented in applications only for ﬁngerprints and it remains untested their
performance in other biometric traits.
Research about the function of the suggested model is currently aimed on tests
on the cryptographic mechanisms for other samples. Secondly, the selection
