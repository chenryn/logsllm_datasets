### Token Filter Test Tab Actions

In the **Token Filter Test** tab, you can perform the following actions:

1. **Base Regex Filter:**
   - Select the **Base Regex** filter and click **Display Results** to view:
     - **Match Results against Base Regex:** This grid displays the tokens used in the base regex, along with any associated schema elements and assignments. An additional grid shows the raw log lines that match the base regex and their contents.
     - **Unmatched Results against Base Regex:** This grid displays the log lines that do not match the base regex.
   - Click **Export** to save the unmatched results to a CSV-format file.

2. **Single Token Filter:**
   - Select one token filter from the list and click **Display Results** to view:
     - **Match Results against Selected Token Filter:** This grid displays the tokens used in the selected token filter, along with any associated schema elements and assignments. An additional grid shows the parts of the message that are matched by each token in the filter.
   - Click **Export** to save the matched results based on the line to a CSV-format file.

3. **Multiple Token Filters:**
   - Select multiple token filters and click **Display Results** to view:
     - **Matched Lines against All Filters:** This grid displays the messages that are matched by more than one token filter. Select a line in the grid to open a **Details** pop-up that lists the values of the tokens used in each token filter.
   - Export is not available for this scenario.

4. **All Token Filters:**
   - Select all token filters and click **Display Results** to view:
     - **Matched against Selected Token Filters:** This grid displays the messages that are matched by more than one token filter.
     - **Unmatched Lines:** This grid displays the messages that are not matched by any token filter.
   - Click **Export** to save the unmatched lines to a CSV-format file.
   - Click **View** on an unmatched line to open it in the **Token Filter Editor**, where you can continue to work on the message.

### Generating a Parser File

#### Navigation:
- **Log View > Generate Parser**

#### About:
- The **Quick Flex Parser Tool** can generate a parser file suitable for use in the **ArcSight FlexConnector** framework. The parser file contains definitions of your tokens, base regex, token filters, and token mappings.
- The minimum requirement for generating a parser file is a base regex that successfully parses the log file.

#### Procedure:
1. Click **Generate Parser** in the **Log View** to generate a parser file. You can modify the generated content and copy it to a separate file.
2. Click **Export** to save the parser properties file. By default, the file will be saved as `.sdkrfilereader.properties` for non-syslog projects and as `.subagent.sdkrfilereader.properties` for syslog projects.

### ArcSight Token Types

Token types are important because tokens can only be mapped to ArcSight event fields with matching types. Event fields and their types are listed in the **ArcSight Console User’s Guide**, under **Data Fields**.

| Type | Meaning | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Integer | A number from -2147483648 to 2147483647. | n/a |
| IPAddress | An IPv4 address (e.g., 1.1.1.1). For IPv6-aware parsers, this can also be an IPv6 address (e.g., fdeb:f59b:2e13:56c9:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx). | n/a |
| Long | A number from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. | n/a |
| MacAddress | An Ethernet MAC address of the form: 00-06-3E-22-51-B9 or 00:06:3E:22:51:B9. | n/a |
| String | Any free-form sequence of characters. | n/a |
| TimeStamp | A date, time, or both. | Date/time format (see "Date and Time Format Symbols") |

### Date and Time Format Symbols

The following date and time formats are defined in the **Quick Flex Parser Tool**:

- `MMM dd HH:mm:ss.SSS zzz`
- `MMM dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`
- `MMM dd HH:mm:ss zzz`
- `MMM dd HH:mm:ss`
- `MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS zzz`
- `MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS`
- `MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss zzz`
- `MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss`
- `ddMMyyyy HH:mm:ss`
- `MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss`
- `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`
- `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`

For example, for the format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`, use single quotes around text that is not meant to be interpreted as date format characters. For a date like `2016.07.04 AD at 12:08:56 PDT`, use `yyyy.MM.dd G 'at' HH:mm:ss z`.

Use two single quotes to insert a single quote. For a date like `Wed, Jul 4, '16`, use `EEE, MMM d, ''yy`.

| Symbol | Meaning | Presentation | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| G | Era designator | (Text) | AD |
| y | Year | (Number) | 2016 or 06 |
| Y | Week year | (Year) | 2016;16 |
| M | Month in year | (Text & Number) | July or Jul or 07 |
| w | Week in year | (Number) | 27 |
| W | Week in month | (Number) | 2 |
| D | Day in year | (Number) | 129 |
| d | Day in month | (Number) | 10 |
| F | Day of week in month | (Number) | 2 (indicating 2nd Wed. in July) |
| E | Day in week | (Text) | Tuesday or Tue |
| u | Day number of week | (1=Monday, ..., 7=Sunday) | Number |
| a | AM/PM marker | (Text) | AM or PM |
| H | Hour in day (0~23) | (Number) | 0 |
| k | Hour in day (1~24) | (Number) | 24 |
| K | Hour in AM/PM (0~11) | (Number) | 0 |
| h | Hour in AM/PM (1~12) | (Number) | 12 |
| m | Minute in hour | (Number) | 30 |
| s | Second in minute | (Number) | 55 |
| S | Millisecond | (Number) | 978 |
| z | Time zone | General time zone | PacificStandardTime or PST or GMT-08:00 |
| Z | Time zone | RFC822 time zone | -0800 (indicating PST) |
| X | Time zone | ISO8601 time zone | -08; -0800; -08:00 |

### Chapter 4: ArcSight Assignments

An assignment can be either a mapping or a rule. Mappings are mapped to ArcSight event fields from the connectors framework, such as `event.sourceAddress`. The type of the token must match the type of the ArcSight Event field for the verification of the assignment to be activated.

A rule provides a level of indirection between the user and the ArcSight ESM schema field a value is mapped to. For more information, see "Quick Flex Parser Tool Rules".

The **Assignments** drop-down list in the **Quick Flex Parser Tool** contains both mappings and rules. This table lists ArcSight mappings. For descriptions of the rules, see "Quick Flex Parser Tool Rules".
