I understand you're trying to install Numba on OS X Mountain Lion and encountered some issues. Hereâ€™s a more structured and detailed explanation of the steps you can take to resolve your problem:

### Problem Summary
You attempted to install Numba using `pip`, but it didn't work. You then downloaded the Numba source code from the Git repository, but realized that you need LLVM installed first. After downloading and unpacking LLVM, you encountered an error related to the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable.

### Solution

1. **Install LLVM:**
   - It seems you were initially trying to install `llvmlite` instead of `LLVM`. You should install `LLVM` first.
   - Use Homebrew to install `LLVM`:
     ```sh
     brew install llvm
     ```

2. **Locate `llvm-config`:**
   - After installing `LLVM` with Homebrew, you need to find the path to the `llvm-config` executable. This is typically located in the `Cellar` directory.
   - You can locate it using the following command:
     ```sh
     which llvm-config
     ```
   - If the above command does not work, you can search for it manually:
     ```sh
     find /usr/local/Cellar/llvm -name llvm-config
     ```

3. **Set the `LLVM_CONFIG` Environment Variable:**
   - Once you have the path to `llvm-config`, set the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable to this path. For example, if the path is `/usr/local/Cellar/llvm/10.0.0/bin/llvm-config`, you can set the environment variable as follows:
     ```sh
     export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/local/Cellar/llvm/10.0.0/bin/llvm-config
     ```

4. **Install Numba:**
   - Now that the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable is set, you can proceed to install Numba. Navigate to the directory where you have the Numba source code and run:
     ```sh
     python setup.py install
     ```

### Example Commands
Here is a step-by-step example of the commands you might use:

```sh
# Install LLVM using Homebrew
brew install llvm

# Locate the llvm-config executable
which llvm-config

# If the above command doesn't work, try this
find /usr/local/Cellar/llvm -name llvm-config

# Set the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable
export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/local/Cellar/llvm/10.0.0/bin/llvm-config

# Navigate to the Numba source code directory
cd /path/to/numba

# Install Numba
python setup.py install
```

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Python and pip.
- If you encounter any further issues, check the Numba and LLVM documentation for additional troubleshooting steps.
