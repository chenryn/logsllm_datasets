User: I am trying to install numba on an OS X Mountain Lion. I had tried the pip install way but didn't work, so I have downloaded from the GIT respositories the zip files. When trying to install numba I realized that I need LLVM first. 
I downloaded and unpacked llvm into the Download folder. The README instructions are: "If your LLVM is installed in a non-standard location, first point the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to the path of the corresponding llvm-config executable."; a message compatible with the RunTimeError I get when running the python setup.py install command.
My problem is that I don't understand what to do in order to make the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to the corresponding llvm-config executable.
Any help? Thanks
Assistant: Ok, I needed to install llvm first. My problem was that I was installing LLVMLITE not LLVM.
So brew install llvm and then locating llvm-config in the Cellar directory solved my problem.
