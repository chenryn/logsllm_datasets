User: Please describe the difference between virtual machines and containers and their respective usage scenarios.
Assistant: Virtual machines and containers are two different virtualization technologies. A virtual machine is a complete virtualization technology that can create an independent virtual computer on a physical server to run operating systems and applications. A virtual machine runs on a computer completely independent of the host machine, so you can create multiple independent virtual computers and isolate data and applications between them. However, the startup and operation of virtual machines requires high resource consumption, because each virtual machine requires a certain amount of computing power, storage, and memory, and thus has less scalability. Container virtualization is an operating system-level virtualization. It uses the host's operating system kernel and related resources to execute multiple containers in an isolated environment. The operating system kernel of the host system is shared between containers, and many libraries and modules are also shared, which saves a lot of resources. Therefore, containers are faster, lighter-weight, and more scalable than virtual machines. The usage scenarios of virtual machines and containers are also different. Virtual machines are a better choice when you need to isolate data and applications, run different versions of operating systems and applications in different virtual environments, or implement compatibility testing and development work. Container virtualization is more suitable when fast and scalable execution of containerized applications is required to avoid problems caused by differences. For example, a large number of application environments adopting microservice architecture often use containers to realize process isolation and deployment.
