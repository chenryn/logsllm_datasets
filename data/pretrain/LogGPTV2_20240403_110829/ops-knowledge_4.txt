Question: "A developer claims that for all requests made to a server using the HTTP protocol, the server's response does not always include a payload body with the requested data. What is the most accurate counterargument based on the HTTP request-response model?"
 "A": "The HTTP response always includes a payload with the requested data, otherwise, it violates the HTTP protocol standards."
 "B": "The server generates a response that includes headers and may include a payload with the body of the requested data depending on the nature of the request."
 "C": "HTTP responses are optional and the server can choose not to send any data back to the client, including headers and payload."
 "D": "In the HTTP request-response model, the payload is only included in responses to POST requests, not GET requests."
Answer: B
