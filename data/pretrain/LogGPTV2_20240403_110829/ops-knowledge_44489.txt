User: the directory /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/ contains the following four elements:
Headers  Python  Resources  Versions
When I try to cd into either Headers, Python or Resources (e.g. cd Resources), I get an error message telling me that the element does not exist (e.g.: "-bash: cd: Resources: No such file or directory").
What's going on here?
Assistant: Try to use autocompletion on TAB key press — maybe names contain some whitespace (less probably)
Check ls -l output — maybe these directories are just broken symbolic links
