Some keyboards (like HP Pavilion 600) have a functional button (F1-F12) that
cannot be locked to use this as function keys without Fn key holding. And no,
they don't have any Fn lock (HP support confirms this). So I can remap most of
these keys, but F9-F12 keys seem as shortcuts (it detects with Remap shortcut
function):
Win-F9 => F12  
Win-Ctrl-F9 => F11  
Win-Tab => F10  
Win-Shift-F9 => F9
But I can't map a shortcut into a specified key, only as another shortcut.
So, I will be glad to use the ability to remap a keyboard shortcut into a
specified key.
