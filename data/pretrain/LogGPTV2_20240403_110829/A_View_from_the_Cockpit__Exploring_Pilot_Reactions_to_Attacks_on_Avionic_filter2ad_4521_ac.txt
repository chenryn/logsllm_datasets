felt that this attack put the aircraft in a less safe situation. The
numbers are lower compared to other attacks as the response
is in itself a safety maneuver, though some pilots felt that due
to the extreme nature, the aircraft is at additional risk. This is
because the maneuver involves high engine power and a steep
climb, possibly into the vicinity of other aircraft.
Fig. 7 shows that this scenario has the least impact as
assessed by the participants—even so, it was judged to have
‘some impact’ on average, with 8 (26.7%) saying it was ‘sig-
niﬁcant’. For workload, there was on average ‘some increase’
with 13 (43.3%) feeling there was a ‘signiﬁcant increase’.
These results imply that the attack is much more of a nuisance
than a risk; the pilots identify and manage the issue quickly
before it can become more serious but still have to deal with
extra work. On top of this, a number of remarks were made
about the startle factor involved on what appeared to be a
normal approach. This can signiﬁcantly impact workload as
the event is far outside the expected set of possible events.
An inevitable consequence of pilots identifying spurious
warnings was that trust in the system was eroded during the
scenario. From Tab. I we can see that 12 (40.0%) participants
would not trust the system later in ﬂight, with the other 18
participants expressing their distrust by switching it off (hence
N/A). Matching this to Fig. 7, 29 (96.7%) participants felt at
least ‘some distrust’ towards the system after the attack.
Generally, conﬁdence in response was very high, with an
average score of ‘very conﬁdent’. The majority of participants
(27, 90%) said they would take the same course of action
in a real aircraft. This is likely to be due to terrain alarms
being such a high priority—with a high risk if the decision
is wrong—that pilots are trained to quickly respond in a
particular way with minimal scope for choice. Indeed, those
who said that they would behave differently in a real aircraft
suggested that they would have opted for a missed approach
rather than landing. In turn, this means that the vast majority
of participants would choose to abort the ﬁrst approach. To
some extent, this conﬁdence can be exploited by an attacker.
Knowing that on balance, pilots are likely to abort a landing if
a terrain alarm is triggered, they can be relatively sure that such
an attack will at least cause a nuisance in the ﬁrst instance.
Evaluation: The reaction was relatively consistent
seemingly due to strict procedure on how to handle terrain
alarms. We can deduce that:
•
•
•
An attacker has a good chance of triggering an unnec-
essary missed approaches on the ﬁrst approach by an
aircraft, due to startling, temporary workload increase
and prescribed reaction to terrain alarms,
The attack lacks longevity—pilots quickly identiﬁed
the alarm as spurious and disabled or ignored it,
A safety reduction occurs but is limited, only becom-
ing worse in unfavorable conditions.
As a result, the attack does not cause a signiﬁcant reduction
in safety and has short-term disruption potential but is easily
managed. Considering that this is the most technically simple
attack, it could be attractive to lower capability threat actors
seeking disruption alone, such as activists.

ﬂying so are not included in approach two statistics.
Two thirds of participants went around on the ﬁrst approach
as a result of the alarm; these participants remarked that their
choice was an automatic one due to procedure. This shows that
triggering such an attack can cause arbitrary go-arounds with
reasonable chance of success, at least on the ﬁrst approach.2
In Fig. 9 we plot the minimum altitude reached during
the ﬁrst approach for those who did not go on to land, i.e.
those who performed a go-around. In this chart, a higher
altitude indicates a faster decision to abort
the approach.
Across participants, we found that the go-around began at
height ¯x: 403.9 ft (s: 51.1 ft). Some outliers in the form of later
responses do exist, also visible in Fig. 8. Most participants
responded within 100 ft of the alarm with an interquartile range
of 29.7 ft. The relatively small interquartile range around 100 ft
after the attack triggered—with most outliers sitting towards
higher altitude—shows that the participants are well-drilled in
responding to this alarm. From an attacker’s point of view this
lessens the safety impact of the attack as a decision to abort
the approach is quickly reached.
As indicated earlier, we expected most pilots to follow
the terrain warning and execute a well-drilled maneuver, not
allowing the aircraft to become unsafe due to low altitude.
However, of the 10 who chose not to go around on the ﬁrst
approach, seven identiﬁed the alarm as spurious and so were
happy to disregard it. Five of these participants felt they could
do this due to good weather, implying that poor visibility
would push them to abort.
To manage the attack, 11 participants switched the system
off prior to a second approach, ﬁnding the alarm distracting.
An attack causing GPWS to be switched off has the potential
for further erosion of safety—indeed, of the 12 who switched
it off, none said that they would trust the system later in the
ﬂight. This is of beneﬁt to the attacker in some situations.
In the case presented as part of our scenario, the terrain was
broadly ﬂat and some pilots had ﬂown into the airport before.
In less familiar circumstances or in challenging terrain (e.g.
mountainous), pushing crew into a situation which forces them
to switch a safety net off could result in unsafe situations.
However, this is counteracted somewhat by the pilots mostly
feeling that either the system was giving spurious alarms so
was distracting anyway. On top of this, most of the participants
who did switch the system off commented that they were
sufﬁciently sure of their location relative to the terrain that
they did not see it as an undue risk.
2In one instance, the attack triggered late; however, in debrief, the partici-
pant noted that they would have taken the same course of action and landed
regardless.

Next, we consider the TCAS attack. Results indicate that
this is the most concerning attack to the participants.
Response: An action summary is given in Tab. III. We
provide the ‘end-state’ of the selected TCAS mode (e.g. if
a participant selects TA-Only then Standby, they are under
Standby) against actions taken which fall outside of normal
ﬂight actions. Actions are categorized into continue on route,
i.e. no extra action taken, avoidance maneuver, in which the
participant changes course beyond responding to an RA such
as changing ﬂight level, or divert to origin, i.e. return to the
departure airport. Some 26 participants (86.7%) turned TCAS
to TA-Only during ﬂight, with 11 (36.7%) switching it to
Standby thus turning the system off. Participants switched
to TA-Only after ¯x: 4.5 RAs (s: 1.7), then down to standby
after another ¯x: 2.8 TAs (s: 2.1). Two participants went straight
from TA/RA to Standby, one after three RAs, another after
six. With the exception of one participant, all followed the
instructions of the RA whilst TCAS was set to TA/RA mode.
This meant following collision avoidance maneuvers involving
steep climbs and descents.
Next,
These actions highlight two problems created by this attack.
First, the attacker has the opportunity to push the aircraft away
from ‘normal’ ﬂight by triggering alerts which cannot be ig-
nored. The range of outcomes to these alerts, coupled with the
fact that the average pilot complied with over four RAs before
reducing sensitivity, shows that there is no straightforward
response. This indicates that the attack has a confusion factor.
the attack caused the majority of participants to
reduce the sensitivity of TCAS and in some cases, switch it
off completely. This is a loss of situational awareness which
could allow unsafe situations to develop later in ﬂight. Many
participants stated that this response was a trade-off between
the additional workload of responding to TAs and RAs if the
system is left on against the loss of full use of TCAS if it
is switched off. They also felt that the additional workload
was too great. Furthermore, some participants noted that the
distraction brought about by repeatedly responding to the alerts
meant they had less time to deal with other aspects of ﬂight.
Looking at the control response in more detail, three of
those eventually turning the transponder to TA-Only and three
of those turning it to Standby took avoiding action. The action
itself varied per participant but for some involved climbing
above the planned cruise altitude or making horizontal ma-
neuvers to try to avoid the attacker’s false trafﬁc. On top
of being unpleasant for passengers, this increases the risk of
incursion into the path of other aircraft; particularly dangerous
when TCAS is apparently malfunctioning. Furthermore, two
participants diverted back to the origin airport rather than
continue with malfunctioning TCAS, which would incur sig-
niﬁcant costs (discussed in Sec. VII). Three of the remaining
participants felt that TCAS was providing spurious returns but
felt the risk of downgrading the system to TA only was too
high and instead opted to follow the RAs as issued. Such a
response would lead to an uncomfortable ﬂight, excessive fuel
use from repeated climbing and the possibility of becoming too
close to other aircraft. The ﬁnal participant was not aware of
the ability to go to TA-Only in the simulator and so remained
in TA/RA.

These responses are important as even though the false
aircraft generated by the attacker were identiﬁed by most
participants as spurious, they still caused a range of emergency
actions. This indicates that
the attacker has a signiﬁcant
amount of inﬂuence though this attack.
Perception: Looking to Fig. 7 and Tab. VI, we can
see that 27 (90.0%) pilots felt that the attack had at least
‘some impact’, with 19 (63.3%) feeling that it had ‘signiﬁcant
impact’. In comparison to the other attacks, this judged to be
the most impactful by far. Coupled with the vast majority of
participants identifying that the TCAS returns were spurious,
a variety of reasons were provided such as unusual intruder
behavior, frequency of RA or that ATC were not observing the
intruders. Some participants commented that they experience
one RA a year at most during their job, so seeing multiple,
rapid RAs was a sign of unusual activity. A further 29 (96.7%)
participants felt that there was at least ‘some increase’ in
workload, typically due to having to respond to regular RAs
and dealing with periodic distraction. An unduly increased
workload creates further problems for the crew managing the
situation and can lead to errors.
Considering perceived safety, 28 (93.3%) pilots felt that the
attack put the aircraft in an unsafe—or potentially unsafe—
situation. A variety of reasons were provided by participants
with three themes emerging: effect on other aircraft, crew or
passenger injury and distraction (as discussed above). The ﬁrst
presents a unique risk to this attack. Since responding to TCAS
RAs results in the aircraft making an emergency maneuver, this
can result in other aircraft nearby losing separation and thus
being issued with TCAS alerts. This might cause the attack
to trigger a chain of alerts, disrupting every aircraft involved.
In this situation, the outcome becomes less predictable since
multiple aircraft are involved, each reacting in their own way.
The other cause for concern was for those onboard who
might be moving about the cabin, thus injured in an extreme
maneuver such as an RA. This is especially true of RAs
triggered at higher altitudes where passengers and cabin crew
may not be sat down with seatbelts on.
Similarly, 29 (96.7%) participants felt they had at least
‘some distrust’ in TCAS during the scenario. Again, this is
problematic as it
indicates that an attacker with moderate
ability can sow distrust in critical aircraft safety systems during
ﬂight. One participant described this as a “crying wolf” effect,
9
wherein TCAS was being triggered so often that they might
start to disbelieve it even though they cannot refuse to act.
Evaluation: In this scenario, the most common option
was to reduce the alerting level of TCAS to either only notify
of trafﬁc (TA-Only) or to switch the system off. We also
identiﬁed some common outcomes:
•
•
•
Repeated, unexpected alarms cause pilots to make a
choice: deal with the disruption and distraction, or turn
the system off and possibly lose the safety beneﬁt,
Time taken to identify the attack was longer than the
other attacks, indicating a confusion factor,
No prevailing way to handle the attack emerged, with
pilots split between a range of actions.
Although this attack is the most difﬁcult to carry out, our
results suggest that it has the greatest impact on the crew,
aircraft, surrounding trafﬁc and the passengers.
C. Glideslope Spoof
The ﬁnal attack is the glideslope spoof, where an attacker
aims to capture a pilot on a false GS and cause missed
approaches. We focus on the ﬁrst approach, in which the
participants knew least about
the attack; our results also
indicate that most pilots identify a problem on this approach.
Response: On encountering the attack, 4 (13.3%) par-
ticipants chose to land anyway on account of having a good
visual picture. This means that they identiﬁed a problem—that
the aircraft was too high compared to the real glideslope—but
felt that weather conditions and terrain were good enough to
correct course and land anyway. Of the 26 (86.7%) participants
choosing to abort the ﬁrst approach, three aborted their second
approach too but landed on their third. Participants aborting
approaches identiﬁed a problem but felt they needed to go
around either to use a different type of approach or to allow
more time to diagnose the issue. The choices for subsequent
approaches were as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
1 (3.3%) used a VHF Omnidirectional Range ap-
proach,
2 (6.7%) used a Surveillance Radar Approach (SRA),
which relies on higher involvement with ATC,
8 (26.7%) ﬂew a localizer only approach (LOC DME)
on account of identifying GS problems,
9 (30.0%) avoided ILS completely, and used an Area
Navigation (RNAV) approach, which is based on GPS,
6 (20.0%) ﬂew a visual approach (i.e. no landing aids)
due to good conditions.
This split highlights that the attack invokes a response gray
area and creates unpredictability. Eleven participants chose to
forgo ILS completely and use SRA or RNAV approaches as
they could not identify the issue precisely. However, eight were
happy to use LOC DME, relying on the localizer component
of ILS, since they felt that they had identiﬁed that just the
GS was affected. Such a range of responses also indicates that
the attack is only likely to be effective for the ﬁrst or second
approach as after this most participants avoid the glideslope.
Even so, by this point the aircraft has already been disrupted
through a go-around which will cause delay and use extra fuel.
(a) Height above ground level at point of ﬁrst go-around.
(b) Distance from runway touchdown zone at ﬁrst go-around.
Fig. 10: Box plots of participants performing a go-around on
the ﬁrst approach under the glideslope attack.
Fig. 10a and 10b show box plots for the height above
ground level (in feet) and distance (in miles) from the runway
touchdown zone, respectively, for when participants opted to
abort the ﬁrst approach. These charts demonstrate the wide
range of ‘abort points’ observed during the attack, indicating
ﬂight crew confusion or startle caused by the false GS. Many
participants noted that it was hard to identify the issue quickly
as initially, everything seemed ﬁne; it was only as the approach
continued and the PAPIs became visible that the problem was
more obvious.
Looking to the average case of the go-around for the 26
pilots aborting their ﬁrst approach, altitude was at ¯x: 930.0
ft (s: 235.8 ft), for distance to touchdown at the abort point
¯x: 1.1 miles (s: 0.7 miles). Since preparation for a go-around
takes a few seconds, the average case abort decision takes
place slightly before the above altitude and distance, i.e. just
as participants descended below 1000 ft.
Considering that a 3° GS has a rate of descent of 700 ft/min,
this means the go-around begins with just over a minute to
touchdown. In poor weather, this might be the ﬁrst time the
pilots see the runway with only a short amount of time to abort
the approach. That the attack is subtle enough for the aircraft
to get so close to landing demonstrates how difﬁcult it is to
clearly identify that an ILS attack is under way. In this case,
forcing a late go-around would inevitably impinge on safety.
Perception: As shown in Fig. 7, 13 (43.3%) participants
found the attack had ‘some’ impact or greater; less than the
TCAS attack but judged more signiﬁcant than the GPWS
attack. This appears to be due to the attack being relatively easy
to manage once diagnosed—though the diagnosis took some
time—with some participants noting that faulty glideslopes
are experienced in practice. Furthermore, a range of routine
options exist outside of ILS, unlike TCAS and GPWS.
The GS attack had a small workload increase with 22
(73.3%) participants claiming ‘some’ increase,
the lowest
average score of the three. This may be due to the GS attack
developing gradually at a higher altitude with PAPIs providing
visual reference for correctness, which the other attacks did
