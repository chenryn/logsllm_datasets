  * VSCode Version: 1.1.1-Insider
  * OS Version: Win 10
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Copy HTML code and try ALT+SHIFT+F
  2. Does not work properly.
                        Shopping
Copy/Paste above code and try to press, Format Code shortcut, nothing happens.
Expected behavior is that span would indent below in "a" tag. also that div's
and a's ending tags will align but nothing happens.
What would I expect is following:
                   Shopping
I have tried also CTRL+SHIFT+X to delete spaces and then do a format again but
nothing happened.
Format will not work on following code as well:
    Shopping
What is the logic behind code formatting, is there anything we can do by
config?
