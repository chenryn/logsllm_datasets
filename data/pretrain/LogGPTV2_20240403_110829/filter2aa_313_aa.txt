**Pre-Publication Version for Conference Release**  
For the final report, including code and detailed description of the demonstrated tool, visit [HORNECYBER.COM](http://horneCYBER.com).

#### ABSTRACT
Building on previous presentations that highlighted the dangers faced by penetration testers using current off-the-shelf tools and practices (e.g., "Pwn the Pwn Plug" and "I Hunt Penetration Testers"), this paper and accompanying presentation explore how widely available learning materials and training resources contribute to inadequate protection of client data and penetration testing operations. These resources often aim to attract a broad audience by minimizing prerequisites, leading many penetration testers to apply simplified techniques in real-world engagements, where the network environment can be significantly more dangerous. Malicious actors are incentivized to target and compromise penetration testers, and current practices make such attacks both feasible and impactful.

The presentation includes a live demonstration of methods for hijacking a penetration tester's normal procedures, along with guidance for examining and securing these processes. The tool used in the demonstration will be publicly released, complete with source code, following the first presentation of this talk.

#### INTRODUCTION
This paper complements a talk of the same title. Both the paper and the talk review previous work and examine the threats to penetration testers. A study was conducted on a large body of penetration testing learning materials, revealing a lack of secure practices being taught—practices that are often replicated in real-world engagements. Recommendations for improving secure processes are provided, and a tool is introduced to illustrate the threats faced by penetration testers. This tool is demonstrated live in the corresponding talk, showing how post-exploitation activities can be easily hijacked by attackers.

#### PREVIOUS WORK
The author has previously explored vulnerabilities in penetration testing tools, techniques, and devices in two talks:
- **DEF CON 21 – Pwn The Pwn Plug:** Analyzing and Counter-Attacking Attacker-Implanted Devices
- **DEF CON 23 – I Hunt Penetration Testers:** More Weaknesses in Tools and Procedures

In "Pwn the Pwn Plug," an off-the-shelf penetration testing device designed to be hidden within an organization was analyzed for vulnerabilities. It was found that third-party attackers could remotely execute commands on the device through a combination of vulnerabilities in the user interface. This talk also discussed the context of incident response and forensics on malicious threat actors' implanted devices.

In "I Hunt Penetration Testers," the focus was on the security of penetration testers using software and hardware tools in remote and in-person engagements. Common security tools were examined, revealing that many lack the capability to secure command-and-control information and sensitive client data both in transit and at rest. A vulnerability in the popular WiFi Pineapple device was demonstrated, allowing attackers to gain remote control, highlighting the risks of operating in hostile network environments with unsecured devices.

This talk, "Secure Penetration Testing Operations: Demonstrated Weaknesses in Learning Material and Tools," builds upon the previous work by exploring the root causes of insecure practices, demonstrating additional vulnerabilities in common procedures, and providing recommendations for more secure practices.

#### THE THREAT
Previous presentations have established a threat model for malicious third-party actors targeting penetration testers. Penetration testing professionals and firms are attractive targets due to their access to client organizations and their position outside the rules of normal business operations. Penetration testers are expected to break rules, elevate privileges, and exfiltrate sensitive data, making them potential conduits for malicious activities. Additionally, more advanced testers may possess valuable, non-public tools and exploits, making them even more appealing targets.

While earlier talks focused on compromising penetration testing tools, this talk examines weaknesses in procedures that can lead to the compromise of client systems and data.

#### WE OPERATE AS WE LEARN – A SURVEY OF PRACTICES IN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RESOURCES
Although some standards documents exist for penetration testing, most circumstances do not require strict adherence to formal standards. These documents generally describe phases of a penetration test but do not provide comprehensive requirements. This flexibility allows experienced teams to use human ingenuity to find vulnerabilities that automated scans might miss. However, it also results in a lack of rigor in protecting client data and systems.

Current learning and reference materials often fall short in addressing operational security issues. The open-source Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) is one of the few documents that address client and operational security, including the protection of client data in transit and at rest, and the security of client systems during and after the test.

Given that most penetration testers conduct tests based on their background and training, it is crucial to examine the security advice provided in learning materials. For this study, a selection of popular books and training materials on penetration testing was examined using the following questions:

1. **Host Security – Penetration Tester:** Does the material address precautions for preventing the compromise of penetration testers' systems?
2. **Host Security – Client:** Does the material address maintaining the security of client systems during the test?
3. **COMSEC:** Does the material address establishing secure means of communicating with the client?
4. **Client Data in Transit:** Does the material address the secure transmission of sensitive client data?
5. **Client Data at Rest:** Does the material discuss securing client data at rest?
6. **OSINT OPSEC:** Does the material address operational security during intelligence gathering?
7. **Potential Threats:** Does the material address conducting tests over hostile networks?
8. **Insecure Practices:** Does the material demonstrate or teach insecure practices without describing the associated risks?

#### OBSERVATIONS FROM EXAMINING LEARNING MATERIAL
This section discusses the results of examining 16 books, four standards/guidance documents, and the publicly-available material for three classes. The goal was to answer the above questions. The study did not include paid training class materials due to usage agreements and limited access. The titles, authors, and sources of the works examined are not disclosed to avoid singling out specific materials. Instead, the focus is on the general lack of emphasis on secure penetration testing practices in widely used learning materials.

#### METHODOLOGY
The methodology involved examining each work to determine if it addressed the eight questions. The examination was conducted in two phases: an initial review of the table of contents to identify relevant sections, followed by a brief examination of each page for relevant text. A simple "yes" or "no" was recorded for each question, with a low threshold for "yes" to highlight the lack of coverage in many resources.

The results are summarized in the following chart, where "Y" indicates that the topic was addressed, and "N" indicates it was not. For question 8, "Y" indicates that vulnerable practices were taught without disclaimer, and "N" indicates that no vulnerable practices were taught.
