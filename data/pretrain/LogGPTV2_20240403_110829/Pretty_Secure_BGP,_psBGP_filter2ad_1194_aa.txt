Abstract
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an IETF
standard inter-domain routing protocol on the Internet.
However, it is well known that BGP is vulnerable to a
variety of attacks, and that a single misconﬁgured or
malicious BGP speaker could result in large scale ser-
vice disruption. We ﬁrst summarize a set of security
goals for BGP, and then propose Pretty Secure BGP (ps-
BGP) as a new security protocol achieving these goals.
psBGP makes use of a centralized trust model for au-
thenticating Autonomous System (AS) numbers, and a
decentralized trust model for verifying the propriety of
IP preﬁx origination. We compare psBGP with S-BGP
and soBGP, the two leading security proposals for BGP.
We believe psBGP trades off the strong security guaran-
tees of S-BGP for presumed-simpler operations, while
requiring a different endorsement model: each AS must
select a small number (e.g., one or two) of its peers from
which to obtain endorsement of its preﬁx ownership as-
sertions. This work contributes to the ongoing explo-
ration of tradeoffs and balance between security guar-
antee, operational simplicity, and policies acceptable to
the operator community.
1. Introduction and Motivation
The Internet consists of a number of Autonomous
Systems (ASes), each of which consists of a number
of routers under a single technical administration (e.g.,
sharing the same routing policy). The Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP) [35] is an IETF standard inter-domain
routing protocol for exchanging routing information be-
tween ASes on the Internet. It is well-known that BGP
has many security vulnerabilities [24, 30], for example:
AS numbers and BGP speakers (routers running BGP)
can be spoofed; BGP update messages can be tampered

with; and false BGP update messages can be spread.
One serious problem is that a single misconﬁgured or
malicious BGP speaker may poison the routing tables of
many other well-behaved BGP speakers by advertising
false routing information (e.g., see [10]). Examples of
consequences include denial of service (i.e., legitimate
user trafﬁc cannot get to its ultimate destinations) and
man-in-the-middle attacks (i.e., legitimate user trafﬁc is
forwarded through a router under the control of an ad-
versary).
Many solutions [38, 24, 26, 15, 41, 2, 20] have been
proposed for securing BGP. S-BGP [23, 24] is one of
the earliest security proposals, and probably the most
concrete one. S-BGP makes use of strict hierarchical
public key infrastructures (PKIs) for both AS number
authentication and IP preﬁx ownership veriﬁcation (i.e.,
verifying which blocks of IP addresses are assigned or
delegated to an AS). Besides computational costs, many
people consider S-BGP to be impractical because of the
viewpoint that requiring strict hierarchical PKIs makes
it difﬁcult to deploy across the Internet (e.g., [3]).
It
has been suggested that the centralized PKI model of
S-BGP counters the distributed trust model adopted by
inter-domain routing where each AS is free to choose
which other ASes to trust. Our viewpoint is that the
matters on which trust is required of S-BGP PKIs dif-
fer from those for inter-domain routing, and in fact, the
purpose for which a PKI is used in S-BGP is indeed ap-
propriate, at least in theory. In S-BGP, the roots of the
PKIs are trusted for their authority of AS numbers and
the IP address space. On the other hand, regarding trust
in inter-domain routing, one AS might trust another AS
for forwarding its trafﬁc but not for its authority of AS
numbers and the IP address space. Therefore, the cen-
tralized PKI model in S-BGP appears to match its pur-
pose well. However, further analysis suggests that while
it might be practical to build a centralized PKI for au-
thenticating AS numbers, it is difﬁcult to build such an
infrastructure for tracing how IP addresses are allocated
and delegated, as explained below.
Agreeing in part with an important design decision
made in S-BGP, we suggest that it is practical to build a
centralized PKI for AS number authentication because:
1) the roots of the PKI are the natural trusted authorities
for AS numbers, i.e., the Internet Assigned Number Au-
thority (IANA) or the Internet Corporation of Assigned
Numbers and Names (ICANN) and the Regional Inter-
net Registries (RIRs), hereafter IANA; and 2) the num-
ber of ASes on the Internet and its growth rate are rela-
tively manageable, making PKI certiﬁcate management
feasible. For example, based on the BGP data collected
by the RouteViews project [29], there are in total about
17 884 ASes on the Internet as of August 1, 2004. This
number has grown by an average of 190 (157 removed
and 347 added) per month since January 1, 2004.
However, it would appear to be difﬁcult to build a cen-
tralized PKI for verifying IP preﬁx ownership given the
complexity, if not impossibility, of tracing how existing
IP address space is allocated and delegated, and tracing
all changes of IP address ownership. This is in part due
to the large number of preﬁxes in use and frequent orga-
nization changes (e.g., corporations splitting, merging,
bankruptcy, etc.). As pointed by Aiello et al. [2], it is
exceptionally difﬁcult to even approximate an IP address
delegation graph for the Internet. Therefore, it may well
be impossible to build a centralized PKI mirroring such
a complex and unknown delegation structure. To quote
from a study by Atkinson and Floyd [3] on behalf of the
Internet Architecture Board (IAB): “a recurring chal-
lenge with any form of inter-domain routing authentica-
tion is that there is no single completely accurate source
of truth about which organizations have the authority to
advertise which address blocks”.
In contrast, soBGP [41] proposes use of a web-of-trust
model for authenticating AS public keys and a hierarchi-
cal structure for verifying IP preﬁx ownership. While a
web-of-trust model has strong proponents for authenti-
cating user public keys within the technical PGP com-
munity [42], it is not clear if it is suitable for authenticat-
ing public keys of ASes which are identiﬁed by AS num-
bers strictly controlled by IANA; thus it is questionable
if any entity other than IANA should be trusted for sign-
ing AS public key certiﬁcates. With respect to IP preﬁx
ownership veriﬁcation, soBGP makes use of a strictly hi-
erarchical structure similar to that of S-BGP. Preﬁx dele-
gation structures might be simpliﬁed in soBGP by using
ASes instead of organizations, however, it is not clear
if it is practical to do so since IP addresses are usually
delegated to organizations not to ASes [2]. We suggest
that soBGP, like S-BGP, also faces difﬁculty in tracing
changes of IP address ownership in a strict hierarchical
way. Thus, both S-BGP and soBGP have made archi-
tectural design choices which arguably lead to practical
difﬁculties.
1.1. Our Contributions
In this paper, we present a new proposal for secur-
ing BGP, namely Pretty Secure BGP (psBGP), based on
our analysis of the security and practicality of S-BGP
and soBGP, and in essence, combining their best fea-
tures. Our objective is to explore alternative policies
and tradeoffs to provide a reasonable balance between
security and practicality. psBGP makes use of a central-
ized trust model for authenticating AS numbers, and a
decentralized trust model for verifying IP preﬁx owner-
ship. One advantage of psBGP is that apparently it can
successfully defend against threats from uncoordinated,
misconﬁgured or malicious BGP speakers in a practical
way. The major architectural highlights of psBGP are as
follows (see §3 for other details and Table 2 in §5 for a
summary comparison).
1) psBGP makes use of a centralized trust model for
AS number authentication. Each AS obtains a public
key certiﬁcate from one of a number of the trusted cer-
tiﬁcate authorities, e.g., RIRs, binding an AS number to
a public key. We suggest that such a trust model provides
best possible authorization of AS number allocation and
best possible authenticity of AS public keys. Without
such a guarantee, an attacker may be able to imperson-
ate another AS to cause service disruption.
2) psBGP makes use of a decentralized trust model
for verifying the propriety of IP preﬁx ownership. Each
AS creates a preﬁx assertion list consisting of a num-
ber of bindings of an AS number and preﬁxes, one for
itself and one for each of its peering ASes. A preﬁx
ownership assertion made by an AS is proper if it is
consistent with the assertion made by one of its assert-
ing peers. In this way, we distribute the difﬁcult task of
tracing IP address ownership across all ASes on the In-
ternet. On the other hand, psBGP requires that each AS
must select a small number of peers (e.g., one or two)
from which to obtain endorsement of its preﬁx owner-
ship assertions. This new endorsement model might re-
quire a new communication path between two peers if
such path does not already exist. Assuming reasonable
due diligence in tracking IP address ownership of di-
rect peers, and assuming no two ASes in collusion (see
discussion in §3.4.1), a single misbehaving AS originat-
ing improper preﬁxes will be detected because they will
cause inconsistency with preﬁx assertions made by its
asserting peers.

tion 2 deﬁnes notation, overviews BGP, discusses BGP
threats, and summarizes BGP security goals. psBGP is

2. BGP Security Threats and Goals
Here we deﬁne notation, give a brief overview of BGP,
discuss BGP security threats, and summarize a number
of security goals for BGP.
2.1. Notation
A and B denote entities (e.g., an organization, an AS,
or a BGP speaker). X or Y denotes an assertion which is
any statement. An assertion may be proper or improper.
We avoid use of the term true or false since in BGP, it
is not always clear that a statement is 100% factual or
not. An assertion is proper if it conforms to the rules
governing the related entity making that assertion. Table
1 deﬁnes notation used in this paper.
2.2. Overview of BGP
Conceptually, a routing network can be abstracted as
a graph, where a vertex is a router and an edge is a net-
work link. If a network consists of a small (e.g., several)
or medium (e.g., tens or hundreds) number of routers, a
single routing protocol is probably capable of exchang-
ing and maintaining routing information in that network.
Since there are a large number of routers (e.g., hundreds
of thousands or more) on the Internet, any single rout-
ing protocol currently available probably cannot scale
to that size. As a result, a hierarchical routing approach
has been used for the Internet. Internet routing protocols
can be classiﬁed as intra-domain (used within an AS) or
inter-domain (used between ASes).
BGP is an inter-domain routing protocol based on a
distance vector approach. A BGP speaker establishes
a session over TCP with each of its direct neighbors,
exchanges routes with them, and builds routing tables
based on the routing information received from them.
Unlike a simple distance vector routing protocol (e.g.,
RIP [17]) where a route has a simple metric (e.g., num-
ber of hops), a BGP route is associated with a number
of attributes and routes are selected based on local rout-
ing policy. One notable route attribute is AS P AT H,
which consists of a sequence of ASes traversed by this
route. BGP is often considered as a path vector routing
protocol.
ASes on the Internet can be roughly classiﬁed into
three categories: a stub-AS has only one connection to
other ASes; a multihomed-AS has more than one con-
nection to other ASes, but is not designed to carry trafﬁc
for other ASes (e.g., for the purpose of load balance or
redundancy); and a transit-AS has more than one con-
nection to other ASes, and is designed to carry trafﬁc
for others.
While a stub-AS may have only one BGP speaker, a
multihomed or a transit-AS often has more. A BGP ses-
sion between two BGP speakers located within two dif-
ferent ASes is often referred to as external-BGP (eBGP),
and a BGP session between two BGP speakers within a
common AS is often referred to as internal-BGP (iBGP).
An eBGP speaker actively exchanges routing informa-
tion with an external peer by importing and exporting
BGP routes. An iBGP speaker only helps propagate
routing updates to other BGP speakers within a com-
mon AS, and it does not make any changes to a routing
update.
A BGP session between two different ASes usu-
ally implies one of the following four types of busi-
ness relationship [13]: customer-to-provider, provider-
to-customer, peer-to-peer, and sibling-to-sibling. A cus-
tomer AS usually pays a provider AS for accessing the
rest of the Internet. Two peer ASes usually ﬁnd that it
is mutually beneﬁcial to allow each other to have access
to their customers. Two sibling ASes are usually owned
by a common organization and allow each other to have
access to the rest of the Internet.
2.3. BGP Security Threats
BGP faces threats from both BGP speakers and BGP
sessions. A misbehaving BGP speaker may be mis-
conﬁgured (mistakenly or intentionally), compromised
(e.g., by exploiting software ﬂaws), or unauthorized
(e.g., by exploiting a BGP peer authentication vulner-
ability). A BGP session may be compromised or unau-
thorized. We focus on threats against BGP control mes-
sages without considering those against data trafﬁc (e.g.,
malicious packet dropping). Attacks against BGP con-
