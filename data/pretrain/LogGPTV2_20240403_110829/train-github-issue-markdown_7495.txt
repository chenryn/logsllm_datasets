This issue has been carried over from JuliaLang/IJulia.jl#116. It would be beneficial to have a mechanism for suppressing warnings, such as the one shown below, without also suppressing errors.

Both @staticfloat and @StefanKarpinski have expressed interest in this matter. A potential starting point for a lightweight logging approach, as suggested by @StefanKarpinski in the IJulia discussion, can be found in the code at `/base/util.jl` lines 418-446.

For example, when using the `Winston` package, the following warnings are generated:

```julia
julia> using Winston
WARNING: New definition
    |(SynchronousStepCollection, Any) at C:\Users\keithc\.julia\BinDeps\src\BinDeps.jl:283
is ambiguous with:
    |(Any, NAtype) at C:\Users\keithc\.julia\DataArrays\src\operators.jl:502.
To fix, define
    |(SynchronousStepCollection, NAtype)
before the new definition.
WARNING: New definition
    |(Any, SynchronousStepCollection) at C:\Users\keithc\.julia\BinDeps\src\BinDeps.jl:286
is ambiguous with:
    |(NAtype, Any) at C:\Users\keithc\.julia\DataArrays\src\operators.jl:502.
To fix, define
    |(NAtype, SynchronousStepCollection)
before the new definition.
```

The goal is to provide a way to suppress these warnings while still allowing errors to be displayed.
