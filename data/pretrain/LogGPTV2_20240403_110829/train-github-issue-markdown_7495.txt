This issue is carried over from JuliaLang/IJulia.jl#116.
It would be useful at times to have a means of suppressing warnings such as
the example below without suppressing errors.
@staticfloat has expressed interest in this issue, as has @StefanKarpinski.
/base/util.jl lines 418:446 contains what looks like the seed of a lightweight
logging approach along the lines @StefanKarpinski mentioned in the IJulia
discussion
