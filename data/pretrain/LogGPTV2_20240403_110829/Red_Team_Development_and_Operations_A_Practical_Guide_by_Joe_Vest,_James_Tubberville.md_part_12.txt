### Post-Engagement Meetings: Executive and Technical Outbriefs

#### Executive Outbrief
The first post-engagement meeting is typically the executive outbrief, which should be conducted within one to two days after the Red Team engagement. This meeting is designed for management and key personnel from the target organization, including both information security and organizational management. The outcome of a Red Team engagement can significantly impact the organization's future operations, potentially requiring funding for mitigations or staffing adjustments. Therefore, management awareness and buy-in are crucial for leveraging Red Team results to enhance the organization's security posture.

**Key Points for the Executive Outbrief:**
- **Focus on the Big Picture:** Present the event as a chronological story, highlighting critical steps and observations.
- **Highlight Critical Observations:** If obvious issues were identified, they should be highlighted in the brief. Note that the final report may contain additional observations not yet discovered.
- **Business Impact:** Emphasize the business impacts, such as effects on production, reputation, and financial costs. Correlate major actions or milestones with business aspects.
- **Cost Estimation:** If possible, provide an estimate of total costs, including lost revenue, remediation, and other expenses, to facilitate executive understanding.

**Executive Outbrief Checklist:**
- **Timing:** Immediately after the engagement.
- **Attendees:** Organizational management (decision-makers), key information security and technical staff.
- **Content:** Chronological summary of observations, critical highlights, and a clear message that this is a preliminary summary.
- **Optional Attendees:** Additional information security or technical staff, critical system experts, and legal staff.

#### Technical Outbrief (Tech-on-Tech Briefing)
A technical outbrief, or tech-on-tech briefing, is a detailed, bi-directional exchange of information between the Red Team, the Blue (Defensive) Team, and the organization. This session is highly valuable for all parties, providing a step-by-step review of the engagement's actions and results. It is an excellent opportunity for training and education, often more useful than the final report for those implementing mitigations.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**
- **Red Team:**
  - Explain Red TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and intended IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).
  - Describe the initial thought process and objectives.
  - Walk through Red actions and associated activities/commands.
  - Provide reasons for each action and its results.
  - Offer recommendations to limit threat actions.

- **Blue Team:**
  - Ask questions about the how and why of Red Team actions.
  - Explain their defensive processes.
  - Identify alerts, triggers, or anomalies during the engagement.
  - Walk through Blue actions in response to Red Team activity.
  - Discuss how Red Team activity could have been detected, prevented, or leveraged.
  - Provide feedback on Red Team actions and recommendations.
  - Use the tech-on-tech information for post-engagement analysis before the official report.

**Tech-on-Tech Briefing Checklist:**
- **Red Team:**
  - Explain TTPs and IOCs.
  - Describe the initial thought process.
  - Step through Red actions and associated activities.
  - Provide reasons and results for each action.
  - Offer recommendations for mitigation.

- **Blue Team:**
  - Ask questions and explain defensive processes.
  - Identify alerts and anomalies.
  - Walk through Blue actions.
  - Discuss detection and prevention.
  - Provide feedback and use the information for analysis.

### Responding to Negative Feedback
Red Teams may face challenges and negative feedback during briefings. Common comments include "We gave you access," "A bad guy would never do that," or "How is that fair?" These reactions often come from organizations with limited understanding of threats and security. To handle these situations, Red Teams should remain professional and focus on factual, non-attributive reporting. Blame should not be placed on individuals but rather on organizational gaps and failures.

**Questions to Defuse Hostile Responses:**
1. **Was the action within scope?** Ensure the audience understands the defined scope and assumptions.
2. **Did the action follow the Rules of Engagement (ROE)?** Adherence to ROE is crucial for maintaining trust.
3. **Has the action been performed in a real-world attack?** Tie actions to known techniques or threats to validate authenticity.

### Key Takeaways
- **Culmination Phase:** This phase marks the completion of the engagement, with data and logs finalized. It is the first time the target organization receives information on the engagement's outcome.
- **Quality Briefing:** The success of the engagement often depends on the quality of the briefing.
- **Homework:**
  - Develop tracking documents for system modifications and sanitization/cleanup.
  - Ensure operator log verification is included in the methodology.
  - Create agenda templates for executive and tech-on-tech outbriefs.

### Engagement Reporting
Reports are the final product and essential evidence of the engagement. They should enable the organization to replicate Red Team actions and results, serving as a basis for improving security. Reports should be formal and consistent, using standard templates.

**Rules for Data Collection and Reporting:**
1. **If an action is not logged, it did not happen.**
2. **If there is no report, there was no engagement.**

**Attack Flow Diagrams:**
Visual diagrams are highly effective for presenting complex threads and activities. They can be used to highlight key activities and observations, making the report more accessible and understandable.

**Observations vs. Findings:**
Red Team reports focus on observations rather than discrete findings. Observations describe the flow of the engagement and the ability to meet goals, while findings are more typical in penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

**Risk Rating and Metrics:**
While risk matrices (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) are common in security reports, they may not be suitable for Red Team observations. Instead, a narrative approach that answers goal-related questions can better describe the risk. If a risk matrix is required, include both the Red Team goal narrative and the vulnerability risk matrix.

By following these guidelines, Red Teams can ensure that their engagements are well-documented, clearly communicated, and effectively used to improve the organization's security posture.
