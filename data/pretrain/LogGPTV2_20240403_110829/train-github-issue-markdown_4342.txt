### Electron Version
11.3.0
### What operating system are you using?
macOS
### Operating System Version
macOS Big Sur 11.5.1
### What arch are you using?
arm64 (including Apple Silicon)
### Last Known Working Electron version
_No response_
### Expected Behavior
When the `frame: false` option is passed to the `new BrowserWindow()` options,
all of the window is a canvas for HTML that is clickable.
### Actual Behavior
The top ~20 pixels of the frameless window is not clickable, and doesn't have
events. It's as if the title bar was there, but invisible. This is the code:
    const { app, BrowserWindow } = require("electron");
    app.on("ready", () => {
      const child = new BrowserWindow({ frame: false });
      child.loadURL("https://github.com");
      child.once("ready-to-show", () => {
        child.show();
      });
    });
See a recording of the bug in action, expected the whole icon/button to be
hoverable+clickable but seems like something is "covering" them:

### Additional Information
Something interesting is that, playing with the option `titleBarStyle` you can
get one version where this particular issue is fixed (BUT it requires you to
show the buttons on hover, which of course it's an impossible requirement in
many cases, so it's still a bug):
    const { app, BrowserWindow } = require("electron");
    app.on("ready", () => {
      const child = new BrowserWindow({
        frame: false,
        // We don't want the buttons, but at least this makes more real estate clickable?
        titleBarStyle: "customButtonsOnHover"
      });
      child.loadURL("https://github.com");
      child.once("ready-to-show", () => {
        child.show();
      });
    });
See how now you can hover on all the elements, BUT it also displays the
buttons on hover:

I tried `hidden` and `hiddenInset` but they oddly enough do show the controls
and they still have the previous issue as the commented here originally (or
even worse in the case of `hiddenInset`).
Related bugs:
  * This bug in menubar is definitely the same thing.
  * I found another slightly related but probably different bug since it's in a different platform, so I believe it might be a different thing (the video linked is dead so cannot verify).
### Code dive-in
I'm way out of my depth here, but it seems this line of code is the one making
the title bar transparent when `frame: false`:
      if (transparent() || !has_frame()) {
        // Don't show title bar.
        [window_ setTitlebarAppearsTransparent:YES];
        [window_ setTitleVisibility:NSWindowTitleHidden];
And then this conditional makes it "visible" if it's not
`customButtonsOnHover`? Maybe? (as I said, unfortunately I can report the bug
but not sure if I follow the correct code for the bug here):
      if (title_bar_style_ == TitleBarStyle::kCustomButtonsOnHover)
        [buttons_proxy_ setVisible:visible];
      else
        InternalSetWindowButtonVisibility(visible);
