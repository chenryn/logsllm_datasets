Question: "Consider a system that uses security identifiers for access control to sensitive data, such as encryption keys stored in registers. The system's transaction scheme includes a special register called 'KEY_ACCESS_POLICY', which dictates which agents are allowed to access the encryption key registers based on their security identifiers. In this register, each bit corresponds to a security identifier, and if a bit is set to '1', the respective agent is allowed access; if set to '0', access is disallowed. Given that an agent with Security Identifier '3' is allowed to access the encryption keys, and that the default KEY_ACCESS_POLICY is set to '0x00000008', what would be the correct implementation and usage of the security identifier in a transaction initiated by this agent?"
 "A": "The agent sends the transaction with Security Identifier '0x00000008', which matches the allowed identifier in the KEY_ACCESS_POLICY register."
 "B": "The agent sends the transaction with Security Identifier '3', which is the position of the bit set in the KEY_ACCESS_POLICY register."
 "C": "The agent sends the transaction with any arbitrary Security Identifier as the KEY_ACCESS_POLICY register will perform a bitwise AND operation to grant access."
 "D": "The agent sends the transaction without any Security Identifier, relying on the KEY_ACCESS_POLICY register's default value to grant access."
Answer: B
