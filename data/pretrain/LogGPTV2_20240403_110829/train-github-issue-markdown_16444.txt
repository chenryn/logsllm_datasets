Minimal example of the problem:
  * App component that uses ContenteditableModel component which allows to edit bonded property and emit changes to parent component via two-way data binding - [()]
  * ContenteditableModel is able to change App.text property
  * App.OnChanges should be executed.

Problem is that OnChanges hook is not executed in the App component , although
value {{text}} is changing properly.
My app setup:  
"angular2": "2.0.0-beta.13",  
"es6-promise": "^3.1.2",  
"es6-shim": "^0.35.0",  
"reflect-metadata": "0.1.2",  
"rxjs": "5.0.0-beta.2",
