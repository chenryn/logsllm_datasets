**ATT&CK ID:** G0010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Turla

Upon initial check-in, Turla conducts a system survey to gather detailed network configuration information. This is achieved through the execution of several commands, including `arp -a`, `nbtstat -n`, `net config`, `ipconfig /all`, and `route`. Additionally, Turla may use NBTscan for further network reconnaissance. [83][238][239]

Furthermore, Turla's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) backdoors have been observed to extract registered RPC interface information directly from process memory. [240]
