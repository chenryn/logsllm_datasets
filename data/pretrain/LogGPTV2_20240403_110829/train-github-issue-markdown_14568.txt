Trying to squish the memory leaks reported by valgrind during in the test
suit, I noticed that we do not have tp_traverse implemented. There are two
things here: First, tp_traverse for the `base` attribute, and second for
object arrays. I guess we should implement both, or is there some reason
against object array traversal?
