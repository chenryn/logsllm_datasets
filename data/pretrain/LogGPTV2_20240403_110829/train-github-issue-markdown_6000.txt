  1. 'android' and ':app' are meaningless to me.
  2. Failed to notify project evaluation listener. -- what?
  3. You have not accepted the license agreements of the following SDK components:
`Before building your project, you need to accept the license agreements and
complete the installation of the missing components using the Android Studio
SDK Manager. Alternatively, to learn how to transfer the license agreements
from one workstation to another, go to http://d.android.com/r/studio-
ui/export-licenses.html`
I have no idea how to install these components or how accept the license
agreement.
  4. `> Could not get unknown property 'compileDebugJavaWithJavac' for project ':app' of type org.gradle.api.Project.` \-- what?
  5. `* Try: Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.`
I tried running with `--info` and got:
    $ flutter run --info
    Could not find an option named "info".
    Run 'flutter -h' (or 'flutter  -h') for available flutter commands and options.
