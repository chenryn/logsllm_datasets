### Abstract
This paper details an approach using SQL injection to gain remote access to arbitrary files from the file systems of Netgear wireless routers. It also leverages the same SQL injection to exploit a buffer overflow, providing remote, root-level access. The paper guides the reader through the entire process of vulnerability discovery and exploitation. In the course of describing several vulnerabilities, this paper presents effective investigation and exploitation techniques that are of interest to those analyzing SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) routers and other embedded devices.

### Introduction
In this paper, I demonstrate novel uses of SQL injection as an attack vector to exploit otherwise unexposed vulnerabilities. Additionally, I detail a number of zero-day remote vulnerabilities found in several popular Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) wireless routers manufactured by Netgear. In the course of explaining these vulnerabilities, I show how to pivot off a SQL injection to achieve fully privileged remote system access via a buffer overflow attack. I also argue that the often-overlooked SOHO router is one of the most valuable targets on a home or corporate network.

Traditionally, SQL injection attacks are seen as a means to obtain privileged access to data that would otherwise be inaccessible. An attack against a database containing no valuable or sensitive data is easy to dismiss, especially if the data is temporary and application-generated.

I will show that such vulnerabilities can present new exploitation opportunities. Often, an application developer assumes that only their application will make modifications to the database. As a result, the application may fail to properly validate results from database queries, assuming all query results are trustworthy. If the database is vulnerable to tampering, it becomes possible to violate the developer's assumption of well-formed data, sometimes with interesting effects.

I will demonstrate three vulnerabilities in the target device. The first is a trivially exploitable SQL injection vulnerability that yields little in terms of privileged access. The second and third vulnerabilities provide successively greater access but are less exposed. I will show how the first vulnerability can be used as an attack vector to effectively exploit the second and third vulnerabilities.

The goals of this paper are:
- Introduce a novel application of SQL injection to exploit a buffer overflow and gain remote access.
- Describe zero-day vulnerabilities found in Netgear SOHO routers.
- Guide the reader step-by-step through the investigative process, enabling independent replication of the results.
- Provide the reader with a set of useful investigative techniques applicable to SOHO routers and embedded devices in general.

### Target Device: Netgear WNDR3700v3
To demonstrate real-world cases where application vulnerabilities can be exploited by first compromising the integrity of a low-value database, I will analyze the security of a popular wireless router. The device in question is the Netgear WNDR3700 version 3.1.

The WNDR3700's robust feature set makes it very popular. It is this enhanced capability set that also makes it an attractive subject for security analysis. Specifically, the device's media storage and serving capabilities are the focus of this paper's research. In addition to traditional wireless networking and Internet gateway functions, the WNDR3700 serves as a DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) server. DLNA defines specifications for serving music and movie files over a local network to DLNA-capable devices. As I will show, the device's DLNA functionality exposes critical vulnerabilities.

### SOHO Router as a High-Value Target
The SOHO router, as a class of device, is generally inexpensive and sees little direct user interaction. It operates discreetly and reliably on a shelf and is often forgotten after initial setup and configuration. However, the significance of its role on the network cannot be overstated. As a gateway device, it is often entrusted with all of its users' Internet-bound traffic.

The vulnerabilities discussed in this paper offer an attacker a privileged vantage point on a home or corporate network. A compromise of such a device can grant the attacker access to all of the network's traffic, making the SOHO router a high-value target.
