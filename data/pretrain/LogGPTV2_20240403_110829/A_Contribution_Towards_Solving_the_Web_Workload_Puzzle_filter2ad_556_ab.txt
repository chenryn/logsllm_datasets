### 2. Background on Used Statistical Methods

#### 2.1 Self-Similarity and Long-Range Dependence

In the context of web workload, we deal with time series. Self-similarity is defined as follows: Let \( X = \{X_i, i \geq 1\} \) be a stationary sequence. The aggregated sequence with level of aggregation \( m \) is given by:
\[ X_k^{(m)} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=(k-1)m+1}^{km} X_i, \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots \]
For a self-similar process, the following holds for all integers \( m \):
\[ X(t) \stackrel{d}{=} m^{1-H} X^{(m)} \]

A stationary sequence is exactly second-order self-similar if \( m^{1-H} X^{(m)} \) has the same variance and autocorrelation as \( X \) for all \( m \). It is asymptotically second-order self-similar if \( m^{1-H} X^{(m)} \) has the same variance and autocorrelation as \( X \) as \( m \to \infty \). Asymptotically second-order self-similar processes are also called long-range dependent processes. These processes are characterized by a hyperbolically decaying autocorrelation function, \( r(k) \sim k^{-\beta} \) as \( k \to \infty \), where \( 0 < \beta < 1 \). Since \( \beta < 1 \), the sum of the absolute values of the autocorrelation function approaches infinity, making the autocorrelation function non-summable.

Long-range dependence describes the property that the correlation structure of a time series is preserved irrespective of time aggregation, meaning the autocorrelation function (ACF) is the same at both coarse and fine time scales.

The Hurst exponent \( H \) is a predominant way to quantify self-similarity and long-range dependence. For a self-similar process, \( 0.5 < H < 1.0 \). As \( H \) increases from 0.5 to 1.0, the degree of long-range dependence increases.

### 3. Request-Based Analysis

#### 3.1 Number of Requests per Unit of Time

Figure 2 shows the time series plot of the number of requests per second for a one-week period for the WVU data set. As seen in Figure 3, the autocorrelation function decays slowly, indicating long-range dependence. We estimate the values of the Hurst exponent using the SELFIS tool [14], which are presented in Figure 4, with web sites sorted by the total number of requests in descending order.

**Figure 3. ACF for Number of Requests per Second - WVU**  
**Figure 4. Hurst Exponent for Requests per Second Based on Raw Data**

As described in Section 2.1, all Hurst exponent estimators assume stationary time series. However, related papers either avoided or ignored non-stationarity. In [7], the authors focused on individual hours to provide nearly stationary datasets. In [21], a two-week period for two e-commerce sites was considered, suggesting long-range dependence based on the variance-time plot without testing stationarity.

Our goal is to study how non-stationarity affects the estimates of the Hurst exponent and the conclusions about long-range dependence. We use the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test [17] to test the null hypothesis of stationarity against an alternative of a unit root. According to this test, the request arrival processes for all web servers considered are non-stationary. We estimate and eliminate the trend and periodicity using least squares estimation, periodogram, and differencing methods. After removal, the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test confirms stationarity. The ACF of the stationary time series in Figure 5 still indicates long-range dependence, but with a lower value than the original non-stationary time series, suggesting overestimation when not accounting for trend and periodicity.

**Figure 5. ACF for Number of Requests per Second After Removing Trend and Periodicity - WVU**  
**Figure 6. Hurst Exponent for Requests per Second Based on Stationary Data**

Observations from the estimates of the Hurst exponent based on raw and stationary data:
1. Values of the Hurst exponent based on raw data are generally higher than those based on stationary time series, proving the need to account for trend and periodicity.
2. Values of the Hurst exponent for all web sites are higher than 0.5, indicating long-range dependence.
3. Hurst estimators provide consistent estimates for all four web servers.
4. Abry-Veitch method provides slightly higher values of \( H \) than Whittle method, consistent with [13].

**Figure 7. Whittle Estimates for Stationary Request-Based Time Series - WVU**  
**Figure 8. Abry-Veitch Estimates for Stationary Request-Based Time Series - WVU**

Since the definition of long-range dependence is asymptotic, we employ Hurst exponent estimators on aggregated time series. Each one-week dataset is aggregated at increasing levels \( m \). As \( m \) increases, short-range dependencies are averaged out. If the value of \( H \) remains relatively constant, it measures a true underlying level of self-similarity. Figures 7 and 8 show the estimates of the Hurst exponent obtained from the aggregated series using Whittle and Abry-Veitch methods for the stationary request-based time series of the WVU server.

#### 3.2 Testing for Poisson Arrivals at Request Level

We formally test whether the request arrivals can be modeled with a Poisson process for each of the Low, Med, and High intervals. To test the characteristics of the Poisson process—request inter-arrival times being independent and exponentially distributed—we use the method proposed in [22].

Before applying the test, the original signal must be processed due to:
1. Web servers having timestamps with one-second granularity, leading to multiple requests with the same timestamp. We use uniform and deterministic distributions for request arrivals over the one-second interval.
2. Varying request arrival rates during four-hour intervals. We divide each interval into four one-hour intervals with approximately constant arrival rates and test each for independent and exponentially distributed inter-arrival times.

**Test for Independent Request Inter-Arrival Times:**
For each one-hour interval \( i \) (where \( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \)), we compute its lag one autocorrelation \( \rho_i \). Let \( S \) be the random variable of the number of intervals having \( \rho_i \) less than \( 1.96 / \sqrt{n_i} \), where \( n_i \) is the number of samples in the \( i \)-th interval. \( S \) follows the binomial distribution \( B(4, 0.95) \). If \( P(S = s) < 0.05 \), we conclude with 95% confidence that the inter-arrivals are not independent. We also apply a further test for independence, checking if the inter-arrivals are significantly positively or negatively correlated.

**Test for Exponentially Distributed Request Inter-Arrival Times:**
Let the null hypothesis be \( H_0: F(x) = 1 - e^{-\hat{\lambda}x} \) where \( \hat{\lambda} = 1 / \bar{X} \) is estimated from the sample. We use the Anderson-Darling (A2) test [26] to test the goodness of fit for each one-hour interval. The null hypothesis is rejected if the modified test statistic \( A2(1 + 0.6/n) \) is greater than the critical value 1.341. Let \( Z \) be the random variable of the total number of intervals having a test statistic less than 1.341, then \( Z \) follows the binomial distribution \( B(4, 0.95) \). If \( P(Z = z) < 0.05 \), we conclude with 95% confidence that the inter-arrivals are not exponential.

Repeating the tests for 10-minute intervals, the results show that the request arrivals do not follow the Poisson process with fixed one-hour or 10-minute rates for any of the considered web sites. These results are valid regardless of the assumption made about the distribution of request arrivals over one second. Our results are consistent with a recent study showing that backbone Internet traffic exhibits long-range dependence at scales of seconds and above [15].

In summary, the results show that web workload at the request level, similar to LAN and WAN workloads, is long-range dependent. This means that several web performance models based on queuing networks [23], [25], [30] or layered queuing networks [8] are based on incorrect assumptions and likely provide misleading results.

### 4. Session-Based Analysis

In this section, we study the session arrival process (i.e., inter-session characteristics) and intra-session characteristics introduced in our earlier work [11]. Previous empirical studies on web sessions mainly focused on simple analysis and did not explore long-range dependence and heavy-tailed behavior.
