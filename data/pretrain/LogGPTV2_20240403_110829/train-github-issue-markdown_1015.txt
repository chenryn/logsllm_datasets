**Nicolas de Loof** opened **SPR-5149** and provided the following comment:

When utilizing the `Spring Assert` class to validate preconditions, the error message is expected to be a `String`. If you need to include contextual data in the message, it currently requires string concatenation, even if the condition is met. It would be beneficial to adopt an approach similar to SLF4J and support `MessageFormat` patterns. By leveraging varargs, we could write:

```java
Assert.isTrue(text.length() <= maxSize, "Value '{0}' is too large! Max size is {1}", text, maxSize);
```

This enhancement would help avoid unnecessary string construction when the assertion passes.
