When using Spring Assert class to check preconditions, the message is expected
to be a String. If you want to pass contextual datas in the message, this
requires some String concat even if condition is validated.
It would be nice to follow slf4j example and support a MessageFormat pattern.
With help of varargs, we could write :
    Assert.isTrue( text.length() <= maxSize, "Value '{0}' is too large ! max size is {1}", text, maxSize );

**Affects:** 2.5.5
**Issue Links:**
  * #11001 Assert should use MessageFormat to avoid building unecessary Strings as error message ( _ **"is duplicated by"**_ )
