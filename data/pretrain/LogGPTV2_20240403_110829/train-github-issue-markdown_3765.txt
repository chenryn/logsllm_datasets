Subject: Issue with Displaying Chinese Characters on Ubuntu 14.04

Hello,

I am experiencing an issue with my Ubuntu 14.04 system, where Chinese characters (UTF-8 encoded) are not displaying correctly and instead appear as a series of strange square boxes. I attempted to resolve the problem by updating the font to 细明体 (MingTi), but this did not solve the issue.

Please find attached a screenshot for reference:

Could you please provide any suggestions or solutions to address this problem?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
