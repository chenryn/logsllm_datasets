increases. The coeﬃcient for bitrate follows a similar trend, but correlation is
weaker for access links whose speeds exceed 60 Mbps, where the wireless network
may be operating closer to its capacity. (The default setting of the access points
supports a maximum bitrate of 130 Mbps, which translates to a TCP through-
put of about 85 Mbps under excellent conditions; actual throughput will likely
be less.) Patro et al. [10] also show in a more limited setting (dense deployments
in two apartment complexes) that achieved throughput is highly correlated with
the above wireless metrics.
The Latency Inside a Home Network is Often a Signiﬁcant Contrib-
utor to Overall Round-Trip Time. The TCP round-trip time between the
wireless access point and a wireless client should be on the order of one millisec-
ond. As this RTT increases, it not only signiﬁes that the wireless link is bot-
tlenecked due to buﬀering or medium access delays, but it can have an adverse
impact on performance, especially for applications that are latency sensitive.
Figure 4a plots the distribution of the median LAN RTT (as deﬁned in Sect. 2.2)
across all devices in our study. The median device on the local wireless network
sees a median wireless latency of about 8 ms, but nearly 30 % of the devices
experience local TCP round-trip latencies greater than 15 ms. Buﬀering aﬀects
latency, particularly for mobile devices that sleep more frequently. While we
cannot distinguish mobile devices in our dataset (because we anonymize MAC
addresses and do not look into the payload), we try to minimize this issue by
considering the mean of the RTTs, and only for ﬂows with at least 25 packets
in the downstream direction.
We also analyze the performance of the home network relative to the wide-area
network performance; we compare the round-trip times between the devices and
the access point to the round-trip times from the access point to the wide-area
destination for each ﬂow. We deﬁne the median latency ratio for a device as the
312
S. Sundaresan et al.
median ratio of the LAN RTT to the WAN RTT (Sect. 2.2) across all ﬂows for
that device. Figure 4b shows the distribution of the median latency ratio across all
devices. The result shows that 30 % of devices have a median latency ratio greater
than 0.2, meaning that for those devices, at least half of the ﬂows have end-to-
end latencies where the home wireless network contributes more than 20 % of the
overall end-to-end latency.
3.2 Wireless Performance of User Traﬃc
We now characterize wireless performance in our deployment. Our preliminary
ﬁndings include: (1) the 5 GHz wireless band consistently achieves better perfor-
mance than the 2.4 GHz band; (2) the performance of a home wireless network
varies across individual wireless devices within the same home; and (3) multiple
devices in the same home network rarely send high traﬃc volumes at the same
time.
The 5 GHz Band Performs Better than the 2.4 GHz Band. We analyze
the performance that devices in home wireless networks achieve and how per-
formance varies depending on whether devices are on the 2.4 GHz band or the
5 GHz band. Our hypothesis was that devices on the 5 GHz band would perform
better because there are generally fewer devices (and surrounding access points)
in the 5 GHz band, and that the 5 GHz band also has less non-WiFi interfer-
ence (e.g., microwaves, baby monitors). As shown in previous studies, devices
on 2.4 GHz experience both WiFi and non-WiFi interference [10].
Figure 5a shows the impact of spectrum on ﬂow throughput for ﬂows that
have throughput greater than 1 Mbps. We present the normalized ﬂow through-
put to eliminate any bias related to the access link capacity. Flows to devices on
the 5 GHz spectrum have higher normalized throughput than those on 2.4 GHz.
Similarly, we see in Fig. 5b that the LAN RTT for ﬂows in 2.4 GHz are much
higher than for ﬂows in 5 GHz. The distribution of normalized ﬂow throughput
in each spectrum is similar between the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz when we consider
Fig. 5. Characteristics of ﬂows in the 5 GHz vs. the 2.4 GHz spectrum.

ﬂows whose normalized throughput is less than 0.1. We are investigating this
phenomenon, but these could include cases where we suspect that there is not
enough application demand. Even in those cases, however, the LAN RTTs are
smaller for devices connected over 5 GHz.
Fig. 7. Distribution of median normalized
bitrates, for devices in both the 2.4 GHz and
5 GHz spectrums. Devices do not achieve
maximum bitrate, especially in the 2.4 GHz
range.
Figure 6 plots the CDF of the median bitrate for all devices in all homes,
for both the 2.4 GHz band and the 5 GHz bands. Only 30 % of 2.4 GHz devices
see median bitrates above 65 Mbps; in contrast, more than 50 % of devices in
the 5 GHz spectrum see bitrates greater than 100 Mbps. It is worth noting that
the wireless bitrates do not correspond to the actual throughput. Even under
perfect conditions, a wireless bitrate of 130 Mbps corresponds to an actual TCP
throughput of about 80 Mbps. The bitrate values thus reﬂect a loose upper bound
on the achievable end-to-end throughput.
Figure 7 shows the median bitrate per device for each home network, normal-
ized by the maximum supported bitrate of the corresponding wireless protocol
(between 65 Mbps and 300 Mbps for 802.11n, and 54 Mbps for 802.11a/g). Many
devices, especially those in the 2.4 GHz range, often operate close to the maxi-
mum bitrate supported by the protocol, more so than 5 GHz devices. However
we also see that the maximum bitrates of 5 GHz devices are higher. This dis-
crepancy can be explained by the fact that many devices in the 2.4 GHz channel
could be small mobile devices with single antennas that restrict their maximum
bitrates to 65 Mbps. Also, attenuation is higher on 5 GHz, which could lead to
more active bitrate adaptation.
Figure 8 shows the retransmission rates for all devices across all homes; the
result shows similar trends with respect to the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz ranges:
retransmissions are more common in the 2.4 GHz band, with about 20 % of
devices having retransmission rates above 10 %.
Within a Single Home Network, Individual Devices Can Experience
Very Diﬀerent Wireless Performance. We also studied the performance of
individual devices in a home network and the extent to which wireless perfor-
mance varies across devices in the same home network. We found many cases
where the median wireless retransmission rates for a device was high. For the

are high. Interestingly, one device has a sig-
niﬁcantly higher retransmission rate.

devices in the home shown in Fig. 9, nearly all of the devices have median retrans-
mission rates greater than 10 %. Interestingly, one device experiences a high
retransmission rates nearly all of the time, suggesting a persistent problem that
may result from device placement, interactions between the access point and
that device’s driver, or some other cause.
To study how wireless performance varies across devices in a single home, we
measure the K-S distance of the distributions of raw wireless bitrates between
each pair of devices in each home. Figure 10a plots the median and the maximum
pairwise K-S distance in each home. We ﬁnd that more than 80 % of homes have
at least one pair of devices with a K-S distance of more than 0.6, indicating
that most homes have at least one poorly performing device (due to either poor
placement, poor hardware, or poor drivers). We investigate the variance of RSSI
across diﬀerent devices and we see similar diﬀerences (Fig. 10b). Future work
could involve investigating the disparate performance across devices further and
determining whether the variability in device performance is caused by any single
factor.
Simultaneous Communication is Infrequent. Most of the homes in our
deployment had more than one active device during our study. Interestingly, how-
ever, these devices often were not highly active at the same time. We measured
one-second intervals and observed the number of times that multiple devices
were sending at least 25 packets within the one-second interval. To our surprise,
simultaneous communication was rare: for 85 % of the one-second intervals on
the 2.4 GHz band and 93 % of the intervals on the 5 GHz band, we observed at
most one device sending at least 25 packets in the interval. This observation
relates to wireless contention and may imply that certain types of wireless con-
tention are infrequent. This ﬁnding contrasts with previous work that shows that
contention is a factor in wireless performance [10]. This discrepancy may result
from diﬀerences in either deployment locations or in measurement method and
warrants further exploration.

4 Related Work
We focus our survey of related work on studies of wireless performance in real
deployments and on attempts to detect and characterize common wireless per-
formance problems.
The WiSe project is most similar to our eﬀorts [10]; WiSe is a deployment of
multiple wireless monitors in a diverse set of home environments that are con-
ﬁgured with custom measurement and monitoring software. In this deployment,
each access point is a custom OpenWrt-based embedded device with two network
interface cards: one that forwards traﬃc and another that monitors the quality
of the wireless channel. Because each WiSe access point has two interfaces, the
deployment sees a much more complete picture of the wireless spectrum. The
deployment is also concentrated in two dense residential complexes; our deploy-
ment is larger and more diverse, but it does not use custom hardware with
multiple network interfaces, which limits our ability to collect certain types of
measurements. The work also designs an estimator for TCP performance based
on wireless performance metrics; validating this model in our own testbed is
part of our ongoing work. Other eﬀorts have deployed dense monitors to study
wireless in conferences, and university buildings [3,5,6]; these studies explore
similar characteristics but do not focus on home network settings, which are
generally lightly managed (or unmanaged) and hence potentially more chaotic.
Papagiannaki et al. [9] deploy and measure wireless performance characteristics
in three homes.
Other work has characterized wireless performance problems using custom
hardware or active measurements. Rayanchu et al. [13] detected non-wireless
interference using custom hardware. Kanuparthy et al. [4] developed a tool to
detect wireless performance problems (e.g., low signal-to-noise ratio, congestion,
hidden terminals) using both active probes and an additional passive monitor
deployed within the network. Other techniques have also studied diﬀerent types
of wireless performance problems. Manweiler et al. build a tool to detect hidden
interference in homes and adjust channel selection to minimize interference [7];
316
S. Sundaresan et al.
the tool requires a custom kernel and does not run on a commodity access point.
Shrivastava et al. develop a tool for estimating interference in enterprise wireless
LANs [14]; the tool requires collection and analysis of packet traces at multiple
access points within an enterprise to perform diagnosis.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we characterized the performance of user traﬃc in home wireless
networks from 66 homes in 15 countries using passive network measurements.
We analyzed passively collected traces in both the 2.4 GHz and the 5 GHz spec-
trum. One of the more signiﬁcant challenges in executing this study involved
designing a measurement tool that could operate within the tight constraints
of a commodity home router and draw reasonable inferences from a single van-
tage point without a second monitor radio. Our study of this real user traﬃc
in home networks revealed that most TCP ﬂows in home networks achieve only
a small fraction of the available access link throughput, that wireless charac-
teristics have a greater eﬀect on the performance of user traﬃc as access link
throughput increases, that the 5 GHz channel exhibits better performance than
the 2.4 GHz band, and that distinct devices within the same home can see very
diﬀerent wireless performance. We plan to build on these insights to create a
diagnostic tool that can identify both the location of the network bottleneck
link and the underlying causes of the bottleneck, should it lie in the wireless
network. Finally, although wireless performance often suﬀers as a result of tran-
sient factors, such as microwaves, passing humans, or even minute changes in
orientation of devices, many wireless performance problems are persistent. Our
ability to monitor wireless performance over longer time periods in many homes
may shed light on the persistent performance problems, which could oﬀer a more
holistic picture of wireless network performance problems.
