## Abstract
Handheld devices, such as smartphones, have become a primary platform for accessing internet services. The small, mobile nature of these devices results in unique network usage patterns. Previous studies have analyzed session, mobility, and performance characteristics of handheld devices using Wi-Fi and 3G wireless traces. This study complements existing research by examining the differences in content and flow characteristics between handheld and non-handheld traffic. We analyze packet traces from two separate campus wireless networks, capturing three days of traffic from 32,278 unique devices. Our findings show that handhelds exhibit low UDP usage, high volumes of HTTP traffic, and a higher proportion of video traffic. These insights can inform network management and mobile system design.

## 1. Introduction
Handheld devices, including smartphones and portable music players, are rapidly replacing laptops as the preferred computing and internet access platforms for users on the go. A 2009 EDUCAUSE study found that 51% of undergraduates own an internet-capable handheld device, with 12% planning to purchase one within the next year [15]. A PEW study comparing 2007 and 2009 wireless internet usage showed a 73% increase in the rate at which Americans accessed the internet via handhelds [10]. While the number of non-handheld portable devices, such as laptops, is also growing, the usage of handheld devices is increasing at a much faster pace.

In this paper, we aim to understand how Wi-Fi traffic from handheld devices differs from that of non-handheld wireless clients and the implications when handhelds dominate campus Wi-Fi networks. Although many handheld users have cellular data plans, 802.11 Wi-Fi remains a preferred internet access method due to its higher bandwidth, lower latency, and lower energy consumption. For our study, we use network traffic traces gathered from two independently managed multi-AP campus wireless networks over a three-day period. The traces include 32,278 unique clients, with 15% being handhelds.

We conduct an in-depth analysis of the content and flow properties of Wi-Fi traffic from handheld devices, examining transport and application protocols, flow lengths and durations, and the nature of the content accessed. We focus on aspects not previously considered, such as the prevalence of multimedia content and the similarity in content accessed by different users. We believe our findings will be useful for future research on optimizing the performance of handheld devices in Wi-Fi networks and for informing network management practices, such as defining Class-of-Service (CoS) policies for multimedia traffic.

Compared to non-handheld wireless users, handheld users access a different mix of internet services and content. While applications like web browsers and email clients are used on both types of devices, content providers tailor content differently based on the device type. Additionally, the interface on handhelds limits the range of internet-based and local network-based services users can access. Therefore, the network traffic of handhelds is likely to differ significantly from that of non-handheld devices. The goal of this paper is to quantify these differences and identify their sources where possible.

## 2. Methodology
We collected and analyzed data from two independently managed campus wireless networks (Net1 and Net2). Full packet traces were captured from approximately 1,920 APs in Net1 over a three-day period in April 2010, resulting in 8 TB of data. From Net2, full packet traces were captured from 23 APs over a three-day period in June 2010, yielding 50 GB of data. Our collection method did not include traffic sent between wireless clients, but we expect inter-client traffic to be rare.

The packet traces contain data from all wireless clients connected to the network, including laptops, smartphones, and other devices. To differentiate traffic based on device type, we primarily relied on user-agent strings in HTTP packets, using a keyword list based on common knowledge and published lists [18]. We confirmed our device classifications using Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUIs) contained within device MAC addresses. Devices that did not send any HTTP packets were classified based on OUIs. Some devices (14%) remained uncategorized due to ambiguous user-agent strings or because they sent no HTTP traffic and their OUI was registered to a manufacturer that makes both types of devices; these devices were excluded from our analysis.

Over the three-day capture periods, 32,166 unique clients connected to Net1 and 112 clients connected to Net2. Table 1 lists the number of clients of each type present in the trace data. Non-handheld devices accounted for the majority of clients in both networks. However, anecdotal evidence from network administrators and industry studies suggest that the prevalence of handhelds is increasing [15]. We observed handhelds from seven primary vendors, with Apple iPods, iPhones, and iPads accounting for over two-thirds of all handhelds.

### Table 1: Client Counts by Device Type
| Device Type | Handheld | Non-handheld | Unknown | Total |
|-------------|----------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Net1        | 5,060    | 22,485       | 4,621   | 32,166 |
| Net2        | 9        | 90           | 13      | 112   |

## 3. Protocols and Services
The protocols and services used by devices impact the performance of both the device and the enterprise wired and wireless networks. Different protocols and services respond differently to bandwidth limitations and congestion, contributing flows of varying sizes, durations, and frequencies to the overall traffic mix. Protocol mix also informs operators about the mechanisms they must implement to secure and monitor their networks.

### 3.1 Network and Transport Protocols
At the highest level, we categorize traffic based on network and transport layer protocols (Table 2). As expected, the majority of traffic is TCP or UDP, with the remaining traffic being IPSec (encrypted IP traffic) or network control traffic (ICMP, ARP, etc.). A significant difference in protocol usage between the two types of devices is the amount of UDP traffic. Over four times as many non-handheld packets are UDP compared to handhelds. In the presence of congestion, handhelds use a fairer share of bandwidth, whereas non-handhelds use more congestion-unaware UDP.

### Table 2: Protocol Usage (% of Packets)
| Protocol | Handheld (Net1) | Non-handheld (Net1) | Handheld (Net2) | Non-handheld (Net2) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| UDP      | 18.4%           | 81.4%               | 25.7%           | 74.0%               |
| TCP      | 81.4%           | 18.4%               | 74.0%           | 25.7%               |
| IPsec    | 0.05%           | 0.3%                | 0.05%           | 0.35%               |
| Other    | 0.15%           | 0.3%                | 0.35%           | 0.35%               |

### 3.2 Application Protocols
We identified application protocols using Bro [13]. Table 3 shows the percentage of traffic in bytes for each category of application protocols. Web protocols account for the largest volume of traffic for both handheld (97% on Net1) and non-handheld (82% on Net1) devices. Almost one-third of Net2 handheld web traffic is HTTPS (versus 3% for Net1), but this is an artifact of a small sample size and a single large connection from one handheld. Email protocols are the second most popular application but account for less than 2% of traffic for both device types. We attribute the low usage of email protocols to the common usage of web-based email and the potential for handhelds to simultaneously use 3G and Wi-Fi. Overall, our protocol usage observations are consistent with other studies [8].

| Category          | Protocols                   | Handheld (Net1) | Non-handheld (Net1) | Handheld (Net2) | Non-handheld (Net2) |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Web               | HTTP, HTTPS                 | 97.0%           | 82.0%               | 91.1%           | 72.2%               |
| Email             | IMAP4, POP3, SMTP           | 1.51%           | 0.5%                | –               | 0.04%               |

| Enterprise Services | IPP, LPD, NFS, SMB, LDAP, SQL | 0.2%            | 0.05%               | 1.52%           | 1.7%                |

| Other             | DNS, NetBIOS, NTP, SNMP     | 0.05%           | 13.7%               | 1.7%            | 18.1%               |
| Unknown           |                             | 0.2%            | 0.2%                | 1.7%            | 5.7%                |

Bro's dynamic protocol detection could not identify the majority of UDP traffic for non-handhelds. More than 90% of the unidentified UDP traffic consists of large flows, ranging from 1 MB to 20 MB in size. While the exact nature of this traffic is unknown, we suspect that a majority of it is likely from streaming media (e.g., Internet Radio).

As handheld usage in Wi-Fi networks continues to grow, HTTP traffic will become an increasingly dominant share of the traffic mix. Network administrators should consider deploying network middleboxes focused on HTTP traffic, such as in-network security scanners or web proxies, to better serve handheld security needs without impacting device efficiency.

## 3.3 TCP Flow Characteristics
We compare the TCP flow characteristics of handheld and non-handheld traffic to determine if and how flows differ between the device types. We examine the flow size, duration, and rate for the downlink half of TCP connections—data flowing from remote hosts to the wireless client—since the majority of data flows in this direction. Flows which do not meet certain criteria, such as minimum duration, are excluded from the analysis.
