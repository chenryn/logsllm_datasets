Let the user set a global setting to have the terminal re-open with whatever
profiles were last open.
Thoughts:
  * what happens when a user has two windows open, closes one with 3 tabs, then opens a new window? Should it open the 3 tabs? Or should it start a fresh, single tabbed window?
  * how do we persist the last session?
  * Do we only persist the last tabs open when the last terminal window is closed?
  * Do we add a "quit terminal" option that closes all open windows, and persists all their open profiles?
**THIS IS NOT A DISCUSSION OF PRESERVING WINDOW _CONTENT_ , ONLY OPEN WINDOW
PROFILES**
This also includes restoring things like previous window positions.
