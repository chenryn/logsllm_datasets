   Second Workshop on Compiler and Architectural Techniques for Applica-tion Reliability and Security (CATARS)   Karthik Pattabiraman Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA – 98052 PI:EMAIL Zbigniew Kalbarczyk University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 1308 W Main St,  Urbana, IL - 61801 PI:EMAIL  Abstract  The second workshop on Compiler and Architec-tural Techniques for Application Reliability and Secu-rity (CATARS) aims to bring together compiler de-signers and computer architects with dependability researchers and practitioners. The goal is to provide a forum for research on application dependability using techniques drawn from compilers and computer archi-tecture. While there has been a mushrooming of inter-est in the areas of dependability-centric compiler- and architecture research, there has been no unified forum for researchers in these areas to publish their work. The CATARS workshop aims to provide such a venue.  1 Themes, Goal and Objectives  As computer systems grow more and more com-plex, it becomes harder to ensure that they operate in a reliable and secure fashion. The problem is especially severe at the application-level, due to the diversity of software platforms and the ever-increasing demand for adding new features in applications. Manual addition of fault and attack tolerance to applications is error-prone and runs the risk of missing important reliability loopholes and security vulnerabilities, which in turn can lead to massive failures and devastating attacks. Compiler and architectural techniques can play a cru-cial role in automating both detection of and recovery from errors and attacks in applications.  The goal of this workshop is to provide a common platform for researchers in the dependability commu-nity to interact with compiler technologists and com-puter architects, so that effective cross pollination of ideas can occur between these two communities. Fur-ther, the workshop will emphasize the importance of designing for reliability and security in the computer architecture and compiler communities, where tradi-tionally the emphasis has been on performance en-hancement. The first CATARS workshop which we organized as part of the International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), 2008 laid the founda-tions of this effort, and brought together researchers in the two areas. We had a very enthusiastic response and we would like to thank all the participants who helped make it a success. We are organizing the second workshop to build on the momentum and ex-plore a broader set of themes compared to the first workshop. This is based on the feedback we received from workshop participants. The objectives that we plan to achieve during the second CATARS workshop are as follows:  1) Discuss how we can leverage the latest advances in computer architecture (such as multi-core plat-forms, reconfigurable computing) and in compiler technology (such as dynamic code generation, proof-carrying code transformations) to improve the dependability of applications. 2) Define benchmarks and metrics for evaluating compiler and architectural techniques – how can we ensure consistent, reproducible results for techniques published in this area. Can we leverage existing work in the dependability literature or should we develop new metrics? How do we cha-racterize the complex set of tradeoffs involved in choosing a benchmark? 3) Discuss how designing for reliability and security will impact the methods used in the compiler and computer architecture communities. Will depen-dability and performance enhancement be oppos-ing constraints, or are there areas where the two goals are complementary to each other? For ex-ample, by incorporating fault-tolerance mechan-isms, can we aggressively perform code optimiza-tions even at the cost of breaking correctness in the uncommon case? 593
 2 List of Topics  The workshop was open to all researchers work-ing on dependability and security as well as on com-puter architecture and compilers. We solicited submis-sions including but not limited to the following: • Automated generation of fault-tolerant and attack-tolerant programs • Compile-time techniques for finding program-ming bugs and security violations • Formal methods to verify reliability and security properties of applications • Memory organization schemes for detection of and recovery from errors • Metrics for assessing applications’ vulnerability to errors and security attacks • Micro-architectural techniques for error/attack detection and containment • Processor support for diagnosing and understand-ing failures and compromises • Programming language support for building relia-ble and secure programs • Reliability and security issues due to multi-core processors and their mitigation • Reconfigurable hardware for providing reliability and security to applications • Static derivation and runtime enforcement of ap-plication-specific invariants • Static techniques to aid development of distri-buted, fault-tolerant programs • Trusted computing base for architecting reliable and secure applications  3 Organizational Details  3.1 Submission Information  Regular contributions were 5-6 pages in length and were refereed both on the basis of novelty of the idea as well as their technical content.  In addition to regu-lar papers, we also encouraged position papers and work-in-progress reports. These were refereed based on the novelty of the idea and the ability to generate discussion at the workshop. Each paper was reviewed by a minimum of three program committee members.  3.2 Workshop Format  We plan to follow the same format for the workshop as we did last year. The workshop will consist of a half-a-day-long series of presentations followed by a panel discussion. Each regular paper will be given 30 minutes for presentation at the workshop (including discussions).  The panel will feature experts in dependable and secure computing from both industry and academia. We will solicit their views on what needs to be done by compiler and architecture researchers to advance the state of art in dependable and secure computing.   4 Organizers  The program co-chairs for the workshop are the authors of this report. The program committee for the workshop includes researchers in the dependability area as well as in the computer architecture and com-piler areas. The program committee members are: • Shuo Chen, Microsoft Research, Redmond • Daniel Connors, University of Colorado, Boulder • Onur Mutlu, Carnegie Mellon University • Satish Narayanasamy, University of Michi-gan, Ann-Arbor • Paul Racunas, Intel Corporation • Mohan Rajagopalan, Intel Corporation • Daniel Sorin, Duke University • Dongyan Xu, Purdue University  5 Conclusion and Closing Thoughts  The area of compiler and architectural support for ap-plication dependability has seen an explosion of inter-est in recent years. Papers on this topic have appeared in both computer architecture conferences as well as conferences on programming languages and compi-lers. However, there has hitherto been no unified ve-nue to publish work in this area. The CATARS work-shop is aimed at providing such a venue. We also hope that it becomes a regular forum for discussing the lat-est ideas in dependability as they relate to compilers and computer architecture.  The success of a workshop depends heavily on com-munity involvement and participation. We were fortu-nate to receive an enthusiastic response from fellow researchers and industry practitioners for the previous offering of the CATARS workshop. While the overall feedback we received from the workshop was positive, we also received some excellent suggestions on how to manage the workshop more effectively and to broa-den its reach. We have tried to incorporate these sug-gestions in the current offering of the workshop. We hope that the second workshop receives an even more enthusiastic response from the research community.  Finally, we would like to thank the conference orga-nizers for giving us a chance to offer this workshop at DSN 2009. We would also like to thank our col-leagues in industry and academia for their support and encouragement in organizing this workshop.
