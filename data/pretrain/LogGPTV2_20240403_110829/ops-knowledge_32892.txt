Analyze logs: Analyze the collected logs at appropriate time intervals to understand previous problems. Make sure there are real-time notifications or alerts set up so issues can be resolved in a timely manner. 6. Trace log: trace the environment where the problem occurred. Find the source of the problem by looking at previous logs. Review prior operation logs and analyze logs from the day before the problem occurred. 7. Find a solution: Find a solution based on the source of the problem. According to different reasons, take different treatment methods. For example consider using Bug Tracking software. 8. Apply the solution: apply the solution, restart the service or replace the hardware, etc. 9. Monitor logs: Continuously detect new logs and check for new problems.
