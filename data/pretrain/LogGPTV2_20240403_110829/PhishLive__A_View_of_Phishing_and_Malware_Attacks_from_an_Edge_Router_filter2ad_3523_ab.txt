### Sampling and Analysis of High-Volume Hostnames

To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we sampled a larger number of URLs for high-volume hostnames. Specifically, we assigned a weight to each cluster of URLs sharing the same hostname, based on the number of malicious webpages within that cluster. We manually checked 400 samples to determine if they were malicious. Given that the total number of unique hostnames was less than 400, we ensured that at least one URL from each cluster was included in the sample. The remaining samples were selected using the calculated weights.

Our findings revealed that 93 webpages belonged to a group of fast-flux hostnames, which we are confident are malicious. Of the remaining webpages, more than 87% were also found to be malicious.

### 3.1 Temporal Analysis

The PhishLive system calculates the number of HTTP requests and the number of malicious URLs observed per hour. User behavior varies significantly throughout the day, which can affect the proportion of malicious website accesses. To investigate this, we focused on the ratio of malicious website visits to the total number of HTTP requests, referred to as the "malicious ratio" in our paper. From an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) perspective, a higher malicious ratio at a specific time indicates a higher probability of a malicious website attack during that period.

Figure 2(a) illustrates the variation in the malicious ratio over a one-month period, ranging from 0.008% to 0.257%. Typically, users make more HTTP requests during the daytime, which might suggest a higher number of malicious website accesses. However, Figure 2(b), which shows the average malicious ratio for each hour of the day, reveals that the malicious ratio is significantly higher (almost double) from 11 PM to 5 AM compared to the daytime. Further investigation indicated that the absolute number of attacks is almost the same during the daytime and nighttime, with a slight increase during the night (an average of 11,460 during the daytime compared to 12,098 during the night).

We believe this pattern is due to automated malware activities on infected computers rather than human-initiated access. As noted in a study [9] on malware infections, about 58.6% of all malware make HTTP accesses, which partially explains our observations. Additionally, we observed a non-negligible number of visits to pornographic websites at night, which are often associated with various types of malware.

### 3.2 Access Characteristics of Victims

Next, we analyzed the access characteristics of malicious URLs. Specifically, we examined the timing of user accesses to attacker domains (IP addresses) and the relationship between victims (IP addresses) and attacker domains. Figure 3(a) displays the timing characteristics of when users accessed attacker domains. The y-axis represents distinct attacker hostnames, while the x-axis shows the date with a daily resolution. We identified three types of attacker domains:
- **Type I:** Domains frequently accessed over a long period, appearing as horizontal lines.
- **Type II:** Domains intermittently accessed by users, appearing as dashed horizontal lines.
- **Type III:** Domains that scatter attacks infrequently, appearing as sparse points.

Figure 3(b) presents a scatter plot between victims and attacker domains, showing that a significant number of victims contacted a few popular attacker IP addresses. Similarly, many users contacted multiple different attacker IP addresses.

### 3.3 Persistence of Hostnames

To understand the persistence characteristics of hostnames, we switched from IP addresses to hostnames, as a single IP address can host multiple hostnames. Since we do not know the exact lifetime of a hostname, we estimated it by the duration between the first and last observations of a URL from a given hostname. Figure 4(a) shows a histogram of the number of days a particular hostname was observed in our dataset. The x-axis represents the number of days an attack hostname was observed, and the y-axis shows the fraction of attacks.

Given that our data spans only one month, we restricted our analysis to hostnames observed in the first 15 days, ensuring each hostname had an equal chance of appearing in the next 15 days. Our results show that nearly 50% of attacker hostnames were present for less than one day, confirming the fast-flux behavior observed in previous studies [20, 21]. However, a non-trivial number of hostnames were accessed persistently for several days, with close to 10% being accessed for all 15 days. Due to the limited data, we cannot conclusively determine the actual persistence of these campaigns beyond the 15-day period.
