User: Is there a way to have a python IDLE shell, like how it is seen on windows? Sorry if this topic has been raised before, I did not find it.
Using Linux mint 17.1 rebecca, Cinnamon 32 bit
Assistant: Install the "idle" package.  Many distros break the core python installation into several pieces, and idle is usually one that is packaged separately.
