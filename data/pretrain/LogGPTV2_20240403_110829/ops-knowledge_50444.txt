User: Using a Linux machine, how many files can one 'mmap' using python (what is the limit)?
Thanks.
Assistant: This is completely system dependent.
This limit won't be imposed by python, rather it will be dependent on your OS settings and the amount of memory you have available. Furthermore, your system may impose a per process mmap limit which you can check at /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count.
