until the week of July 22, 2012, and partially during the week of
May 6, 2012) due to hardware failures affecting the master server.
We also run iffinder [5] each week on the list of interface
IP addresses discovered by the previous week’s DNS queries –
that is, all of the IP addresses with reverse DNS records under
the *.atlas.cogentco.com hierarchy. In the ﬁrst week, this was
42,100 interfaces (62,906 probes); as of the week of April 28, 2013,
it is now 53,457 interfaces (81,736 probes). These probes are not
distributed, and currently complete in approx. 38 hours (up from
approx. 29 hours in the ﬁrst weeks). The weekly iffinder data is
used to validate our grouping of interfaces into routers (§4.1).
We group interfaces into routers based on the DNS records; gen-
eralizing from the examples in §1, we consider Cogent’s reverse
DNS records to consist of three ﬁelds:
(interface).(router).(location).atlas.cogentco.com,
where the router ﬁeld may include one or more levels of the DNS
hierarchy. Additionally, we infer interface types using the Cisco
naming conventions in Table 1.
Finally, to account for transient DNS failures, we smooth our
weekly dataset based on surrounding weeks according to the fol-
lowing rule: if an interface is missing in Week N, yet present in
Weeks (N − 1) and (N + 1) with the same corresponding IP ad-
dress, we consider its absence in week N to be accidental. Exclud-
ing the weeks of March 11 and 18, 2012, this smoothing process
increased the number of interfaces each week by 0.18% on aver-
age. By this process, an interface not present for two consecutive
weeks is considered to be removed.
All of our code for measurement, parsing, smoothing, graphing,
and analysis is publicly available.2
4. VALIDATION
Internet topographers are faced with two challenges in their work.
First, because most Internet maps are built by inference, they must
asses a map’s validity, comparing it with maps built with other tech-
niques, or by comparing with the limited ground-truth data avail-
able. Second, they must determine the completeness of their cover-
age. In this section, we address these challenges through compar-
ison with three additional datasets: router aliases determined with
iffinder [5], public information provided by Cogent, and a com-
plete set of reverse DNS records collected by an anonymous “In-
ternet Census” project [6].
4.1 Validity of router de-aliasing
As previously discussed, ISPs are not required to maintain con-
sistency between a router interface’s true location and its reverse
2http://github.com/brownsys/pl-mapping/
DNS record. This makes any effort to group interfaces into routers
by using DNS records potentially problematic. Therefore, to double-
check our efforts, we ran iffinder [5], a traditional solution to the
alias resolution problem, each week on the interfaces discovered in
the previous week.
The iffinder tool works in the following manner: for each in-
terface, it sends one or more UDP packets to high-numbered ports;
these packets are designed to elicit ICMP Port Unreachable mes-
sages in response. If received, the source address of any ICMP mes-
sage is assumed to also be an interface on the same router, assuming
this source address is different from the destination address of the
original probe [14]. This technique produces a list of IP address
pairs which iffinder infers are aliases of the same router. By tak-
ing the transitive closure of these pairs, we produce a candidate set
of router aliases (e.g., if we see pairs (A, B), (B, C), (D, C), we
infer a single router with interfaces {A, B, C, D}).
The iffinder approach naturally leads to a higher rate of false
negatives (failing to infer two interfaces are on the same router)
than false positives (inaccurately inferring two interfaces are on
the same router). Therefore, to validate our DNS-based grouping,
we search for instances in which our DNS-based approach infers
two or more routers for a set of interfaces, yet iffinder infers
only one. If such instances occurred frequently and persistently,
it would suggest that Cogent fails to keep their interface’s reverse
DNS records consistent with reality.
Our analysis implies that Cogent maintains their interface’s DNS
records consistently. In each week, less than 1% of the candidate
routers inferred by iffinder contained IP address with reverse
DNS records suggesting multiple routers. Furthermore, 95.8% of
these discrepancies last for one week or less, and could be due to the
delay between our platform’s DNS queries and iffinder probes.
We ﬁnd that only 1.7% of discrepancies persist for more than two
weeks, affecting just 28 interfaces (0.053% of all interfaces).
Finally, we note that iffinder’s technique also discovers new
router interfaces, not in our DNS-based dataset. On average, these
interfaces, which lack reverse DNS records, accounted for 0.86%
of the total number of interfaces discovered by either approach.
4.2 Comparison with public information
Cogent provides a graphical network overview on their public
website [4]. This map is very coarse, unfortunately, and only con-
tains a single point for each of the 192 cities in which Cogent main-
tains a presence. Furthermore, this public graph only contains edges
between geographically neighboring cities. Nevertheless, this graph
provides a public source of ground truth about Cogent’s network.
To compare, we extracted the list of 187 airport-like codes dis-
covered in our dataset (e.g., jfk, sfo, fco), and plotted each in-
ferred location on a map. Through manual inspection, we deter-
mined that our dataset is missing only nine cities (4.7%) – three
in the US, and six in Europe. In addition, our dataset contains air-
port codes for four cities not shown on the published map – one in
the US, and three in Europe. traceroute probes to interfaces we
believe are located in these four cities revealed IP paths consistent
with the new cities’ presumed locations.
While not conclusive, we believe the close similarity between
our map and Cogent’s suggests our DNS record-based dataset cov-
ers around 95% of the cities in Cogent’s network.
In addition, Cogent’s 10-K Annual Report provides public dec-
larations about their network [2]. This legal document describes
the services Cogent provides to its customers, which are consistent
with the list of inferred interface types given in Table 1. The annual
report also states that their primary service is provided at 100 Mbps,

which matches the composition of physical interfaces we observed,
as shown in Figure 3.
4.3 Reverse DNS coverage
The initial list of IP addresses for which we issue reverse DNS
queries each week was chosen based on IP addresses observed
in select traceroute probes. With these addresses, we identiﬁed
