User: In appengine documentation, it says that the put() method replaces the previous entity. But when I do so it always adds a new entity to the datastore. How do I update an entity?
Assistant: If you call .put() on an entity that you've previously retrieved from the datastore, it will update the existing entity. (Make sure you're not specifying a new key for the entity.)
