Hello,
So recently we discovered an issue with one site we built when using android
chrome with the data saver mode turned on. Basically data saver mode uses a
google proxy. The main page would load, but all 'sub' pages returned a 404.
Digging around we found an exception in the prod.log.
[2016-11-22 09:16:29] request.ERROR: Uncaught PHP Exception
Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\BadRequestHttpException:  
The request headers contain conflicting information regarding the origin of
this request. at
vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/HttpKernel/HttpKernel.php:67
Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Exception\ConflictingHeadersException(code:
0): The request has both a trusted Forwarded header and a trusted Client IP
header, conflicting with each other with regards to the originating IP
addresses of the request. This is the result of a misconfiguration. You should
either configure your proxy only to send one of these headers, or configure
Symfony to distrust one of them.
The headers being sent were:  
Array  
(  
[Host] => www.oursite.com  
[Accept] => text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,
_/_ ;q=0.8  
[Accept-Encoding] => gzip, deflate, sdch  
[Accept-Language] => en-US,en;q=0.8,fr-CA;q=0.6,fr;q=0.4,es;q=0.2  
[Cache-Control] => max-age=0  
[Forwarded] => for=70.72.63.221  
[Save-Data] => on  
[Scheme] => http  
[Upgrade-Insecure-Requests] => 1  
[Via] => 1.1 Chrome-Compression-Proxy  
[X-Forwarded-For] => 70.72.63.221  
[Connection] => Keep-alive  
)
Which shows it has both headers, but they match (other than for=X in the
Forwarded header).
What I'm wondering is if this should have caused the error it did? Looking at
the bootstrap.php.cache relevant code it checks it the addresses match, but
I'm not 100% sure if it should have been an error.
This is also somewhat problematic since we didn't configure any proxy
settings. This is a user proxy that they can enable/disable and since there
are so many android devices out there with Chrome, this could affect any site
using symfony. Oddly enough another site using a similar set of bundles
doesn't have these issues so I'm quite confused.
