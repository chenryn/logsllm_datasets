### Title: EU-19 Mobile Network Hacking, IP Edition

Over the past decade, mobile networks have seen significant security enhancements, including improved GSM encryption, stronger SIM card security, and more robust SS7 configurations. These advancements have been driven by research presented at this and other hacking conferences.

However, as mobile networks have evolved, they have also become increasingly complex, integrating a growing number of IT technologies such as SIP, WiFi, IPSec, and, most notably, web technologies. This integration has introduced new security challenges.

In this talk, we will highlight the security vulnerabilities that arise when IT protocols are integrated into mobile networks. We will demonstrate how certain hacking techniques, previously thought to be mitigated, can still be exploited. These include:

- **IMSI Catchers:** Devices that intercept and track mobile phone traffic.
- **Remote SMS Interception:** Techniques for capturing text messages without the user's knowledge.
- **Universal Caller ID Spoofing:** Methods for falsifying caller ID information.

We will also examine the protective measures that are currently missing from mobile networks and discuss strategies for effectively transferring best practices from the IT security domain to the mobile network environment.
