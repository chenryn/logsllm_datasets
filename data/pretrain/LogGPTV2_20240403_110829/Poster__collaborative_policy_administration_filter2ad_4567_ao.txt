within Green Zones that would collaborate with 
students to either:
i. 
Develop the student proposals to work in the 
context of their Green Zone area, or
ii.  Develop Green Zone resident proposals on the 
same theme as student proposals e.g. water 
saving, re-use/recycle, local working, local/
seasonal food.
The matchmaking was facilitated by Camden Council’s 
Sustainability Team and DESIS project staff.  Our ambition 
was that by April 2012 students would be ready and 
able to meet with Green Zone local community groups 
to discuss how their proposals (i or ii above) might be 
realized and facilitated by co-design.  These dates were 
not possible to meet not least because of the Easter

break.  By the 17th April 2012 not all the undergraduate 
students had submitted their work for the website.  This 
made it difficult for us to match students with residents 
and vice versa.  We realized there might be community 
groups who were not being served too i.e. had turned up 
and had good projects but that our students were not 
interested in these themes.  Fortunately the postgraduate 
MA Applied Imagination students were able to work 
with the communities that the undergraduate students 
were not able to so that we could approach the project 
in the way we felt was appropriate.  Concurrently, we 
worked with the undergraduate BA (Hons) Product 
Design students who did not feel able to engage in 
the full collaborative process on their own terms to 
ensure that despite their failure to engage in co-design 
in the way the brief required, were able to meet their 
course requirements and achieve their desired learning 
outcomes and course deliverables.
5.  STUDENTS CRISIS – PRODUCTS AS TOUCHPOINTS 
AND/OR TRIGGERS
On return to CSM after the Easter break on 17th 
April 2012, the scale of the BA (Hons) Product Design 
student crisis we were experiencing with the project 
started to become clearer to us.  We got the BA (Hons) 
Product Design course director involved to refocus 
those students who had not delivered presentations 
for the website.  We gave a number of additional 
tutorials and managed to help students crystallize 
their ideas, thoughts and proposals in ways they could 
experience as meaningful, to help them commence 
community dialogue.  Some of that dialogue did not 
take the form of a co-design workshop as we had 
anticipated but certainly saw rich levels of community 
engagement begin to take place. As the students 
engaged in what they more easily recognized as 
design practice, harmony returned to the group.
The problems some students experienced was first 
that the local context in which students were seeking 
to apply their proposals did not provide the range of 
opportunities some of the students felt they needed, 
a consequence of them wishing to realize their 
preconceived design proposals over those available to 
them from within the communities that responded to 
the call for collaboration.  For these students we had to 
look slightly further afield for communities that were 
more of a match and this made a lot of extra work for 
57
the team.  It also meant extra meetings were required 
with these new collaborating groups to quickly establish 
opportunities for collaboration and manage expectations 
before handing over the dialogue to be managed by 
the students and collaborators themselves.  Secondly, 
some of the student proposals were not up to standard 
and there was no group we could match them with so 
we had to get them to start from scratch.  Thirdly, given 
the additional challenges and associated workload, we 
were not sure we were going to be ready to meet the 
schedule we had created i.e. the next deadline of 24th 
April 2012 – for a co-design workshop (1) to be run with 
residents (hosted either at CSM or in the participating 
Green Zone locations, dependent on available space/
resources) where students were supposed to:
i.  Work with residents to review the systems and 
user journeys/experiences of residents and 
other stakeholders in relation to the proposed 
services.
ii.  Work together with residents to identify potential 
touchpoints that serve as possible opportunities 
for product design intervention.
We relaxed these requirements and our terms for the 
BA group and established a more flexible agenda for 
students and their collaborators to work within.  We 
became grateful that we had managed to match all 
the students up with a community group at all, even if 
the process had not been as anticipated!  Ultimately 
this meant that the project team had to put in many 
extra hours and set up many meets to make the 
project work, but ultimately that all the students could 
get through the project in a way that was meaningful 
and useful to them. 
Those community groups that contacted us and that BA 
(Hons) Product Design students were not matched with 
were not ignored.  To meet some of the expectations 
we had created by liaising with the Camden Council 
and residents about this project, we matched students 
from MA Applied Imagination with these groups 
instead.  However, to ensure that the student experience 
was meaningful we had to work hard to enable those 
postgraduate students that vigorously engaged with 
the project by; (i) teaching service design skills and 
collaborative design methods and approaches and, 
(ii) delivering more lectures, tutorials and community 
meets than we previously anticipated we would have to 
deliver when commencing the project!
Some excellent scoping work has been delivered 
by student groups from MA Applied Imagination, 
who included BA (Hons) Product students in group 
discussions and learning, and were keen to set up co-
design workshops.  With our support further student 
co-design workshops took place in mid May 2012. 
6.  CO-DESIGN WORKSHOP REPORTS
Some students managed to co-design aspects of the 
project with the community but not all aspects given 
the time frames and late start were co-designed, despite 
what some students asserted.  A number of the projects 
utilized instead a user-centered design methodology 
and in our view, despite our best efforts, this approach 
dominated amongst the undergraduate product design 
cohort.  A clearer picture of the situation perhaps can 
be best understood from the feedback that we have 
endeavored to obtain since completing the project.
6.1. Students
It has proved difficult to get any significant post project 
student feedback from the undergraduate students.  
Many have left CSM and are not residents in the UK and 
made their comments so clear during the project life 
span, that they appear to us to have seen the project’s 
final result as a success, given their was good feedback 
to the final exhibition of their work.  However, three 
of the twelve undergraduate students have feedback 
positively.  One of them, Lubna Jamaldin, says she now 
wants to be a social designer and has subsequently 
been taken on as a paid intern with DACRC.  Another, 
Tahiya Mueen, explored social enterprise as a way 
of developing her proposals for promoting public 
and collaborative food growing via food packaging.  
Feedback from the postgraduate students has been very 
positive too.  The Green Camden project was a highlight 
of student feedback for the course as a whole and one 
of the student team members has gone on to develop 
a social enterprise working with communities to 
regenerate neighborhoods with local residents utilizing 
many of the approaches that were taught during the 
Green Camden project.
6.2. Residents
Not all residents fed back formally either and 
ultimately we deduced from interviews that some of 
the problems our students may have experienced were 
linked to a general understanding of the ‘designer as 
stylist’.  For example, one resident suggested that the 
most significant contribution was that ‘designers can 
make it all look pretty’.  Others appeared to understand 
the role of the design students as ‘volunteers’ that 
would help to refurbish premises or implement 
existing community proposals – which was not 
possible in the context of this project as students had 
to deliver design, not simply labor.   
When an exhibition of the work opened to the public 
at CSM in June 2012 a number of the community 
groups attended. It was obvious that the diverse roles 
and contributions of design(ers) was misunderstood 
by some stakeholders.  Some of the stakeholders did 
not understand why the products, services and systems 
that had been co-created (and presented in the films 
that students produced for the show) had not gone 
on to be implemented by the students.  The compost 
distribution service designed with and for local whole 
food company Alara Foods was one example of this, 
with the project leader expressing concern that the 
final design had not yet been implemented.  (See 
Compost Container For Public Space by Fernando 
Laposse - Image 3 in Appendix 2).  Even amongst those 
residents who were more design savvy, we felt there 
was an assumption that once designers were involved, 
because Camden Council had brokered the connection, 
that the proposals developed would be funded for 
implementation by Camden Council immediately.   This 
is one of the biggest problems we encountered – that 
there was an expectation that had been created that 
could not be met by the project because of financial 
implications in a context of austerity.  It took us time 
to bring Camden’s sustainability group back into the 
loop and for them to be ready to meet with residents 
and to review decisions about how to go forward with 
the residents’ design proposals that had originated 
from their work with our students.  
Certainly some of the groups who were working with 
residents such as GetMore, a local social enterprise who 
assisted in locating collaborators for student projects, 
found the design process positive; ‘because of this 
intervention we have really great relations with Adam 
Thorpe and his team and he is championing our entry 
into the NESTA Hands Off My Bike challenge’.  Their 
comment, however, suggests that the project worked 
for them as a networking and capacity building activity, 
rather than achieving the objectives residents/students 
were after (i.e. GetMore felt the project was significant 
58
as it might lead to future benefits for them with the 
players involved, rather than commenting on the work 
delivered with the students).  Additionally, Camden 
Council were very positive about the progress made 
as regards to community engagement, development 
and application of a new process for collaboration and 
engagement which they felt would be useful to other 
areas of the council. Indeed, there have been several 
opportunities for the DESIS project team to work with 
the council in support of social enterprise activity in the 
borough that stemmed directly from this project.
7.  PROTOTYPING OUTPUTS
Many of the project outputs were product service 
systems, product elements of which the students 
developed as design models and production drawings.  
The context for the product proposals were explained 
within short films made to illustrate the service systems 
that the products facilitated.  Communities’ can use the 
films to ‘pitch’ for funding to implement the proposals 
in the future. It is product not service design focused 
because of course requirements, but some of the 
products could be understood as design ‘triggers’12 
rather than actual products as they conceptualize 
alternative visions for product innovation linked 
to achieving more sustainable ways of living.  The 
postgraduate students focused on the creation of co-
design tools that could be used by communities to build 
innovative capacity via collaboration. The student’s 
collaborative designs are illustrated in Appendix 2 and 
the short films are available to view at http://vimeo.
com/designagainstcrime/videos.
8.  EXHIBITING GREEN CAMDEN 
The DESIS Green Camden exhibition featured students 
and residents talking about their projects and design 
concepts on video.  The films were created by bringing 
in an outside coach from the local social enterprise 
hub to coach students in the creation and delivery 
of three-minute elevator pitches that communicated 
the public and collaborative service proposals.  An 
exhibition of these films was presented for public view 
and a range of duty-holders and stakeholders attended 
to celebrate the project and to consider how the

proposals might be taken forward for implementation. 
The exhibition was in June 2012 and was part of the 
student degree shows at CSM - a big opportunity as 
it was the first time our shows had been housed in 
our new building and consequently attendance was 
significant.  CSM estimate almost 4,000 external 
guests attended the opening night with 1,000 per day 
across all the CSM shows i.e. 10,000 people in total 
although we are unable to truthfully estimate how 
many people viewed the films.
Certainly the DESIS Green Camden exhibition was 
low key in comparison to some of the course shows 
that occupied the building.  Despite this, the DESIS 
exhibition nevertheless produced positive peer 
review from the art and design community.  It was 
complimented for promoting new ideas for more 
sustainable living and consequently received support 
from staff and students.  A number of courses have 
since offered to work with the DESIS Lab which 
ensures a positive future for DESIS projects at CSM.
9.  CONCLUSION
The DESIS Public and Collaborative project was the 
first project where the coordinating team based 
at a Research Centre allowed students to lead the 
co-designing process with community collaborators 
rather than research staff members.  Much positive 
strength of such an opportunity and engagement 
emerged.  There were also weaknesses associated with 
this approach that require address in future projects.  
These concerns can be summarized as:
(i) Expectation management.  Working out ways that 
the expectations of the project team and partners are 
managed from the outset without turning them off the 
project needs more time and thought than we allowed.  
Working with partners who already have an identified 
need/desire (aim) is much easier.  In these circumstances 
it is possible to give the project a way of defining 
and measuring success and to ensure expectations of 
different groups are proportionate.  Many of the student 
designers interpreted the need to accommodate and 
respond to community needs and desires rather than 
assert their own perspectives as a passive role and felt 
the role of ‘designer as facilitator,’ that they understood 
was required of a co-design approach, was hard for 
some community groups to understand.  As for the 
expectations of the community actors, some of them 
had previous experience of actors from outside their 
communities coming to ‘help’ them with their projects.  
These interventions had been limited to the provision of 
labor and materials for the refurbishment of community 
premises as required by the community groups involved.  
This limited experience and mis-understanding of what 
co-design meant led to expectations of students and 
communities being misaligned.  Most students wanted 
to optimize the application of their design skills and 
competencies, especially given that the project was 
being assessed and contributed to the grading of their 
final degree.  These contradictory expectations were 
not easily aligned and it took some time to establish 
what contribution design could make beyond painting 
the community’s walls for them and implementing 
the community’s preconceived ideas.  On reflection 
more time should have been invested in building a 
relationship between the project partners around the 
opportunity for co-design engagement, than took place.  
We should have taken time to include some events that 
could show the communities concerned the contribution 
that design can make in furthering the sustainability 
of social innovations before we started so they were 
clearer about what could be achieved.
(ii) Engagement/Set Up.  In several instances projects 
were proposed by community groups that were 
presented as ‘community projects’ when in fact there 
were only a few people within the communities that 
the projects purported to serve that were committed/
prepared to work on the projects.  In future we feel it is 
important to find ways to get more engagement from 
community groups – perhaps via delivering project 
activities and learning opportunities,in open, accessible 
places so that people can see what is happening and get 
involved.  This would require a longer lead in time for 
the projects as we would need to have an engagement 
stage that enabled ‘public(s)’13 to form naturally from 
those who were interested or concerned about the 
issues the activities addressed.  Also we recognize that 
we need to find ways to engage diverse stakeholders 
that the projects may depend upon e.g. businesses and 
premises owners – to ensure involvement from the 
start, rather than as the project focus emerged.  Early 
engagement with broad stakeholder groups is more 
likely to create a shared ownership for the projects and 
achieve greater collaboration.
(iii) Evaluation.  In the rush to join in with the
