### Collaboration within Green Zones

Within the Green Zones, students and local residents were to collaborate on one of two objectives:
1. **Develop Student Proposals**: Tailor student proposals to fit the specific context of their designated Green Zone.
2. **Develop Resident Proposals**: Create resident proposals that align with the themes of the student proposals, such as water conservation, reuse and recycling, local employment, and seasonal/local food.

The matchmaking process was facilitated by Camden Councilâ€™s Sustainability Team and DESIS project staff. Our goal was for students to be prepared to meet with local community groups in the Green Zones by April 2012 to discuss how their proposals could be realized through co-design. However, this timeline was not met, partly due to the Easter break. By April 17, 2012, not all undergraduate students had submitted their work for the website, making it challenging to match students with residents and vice versa. We also realized that some community groups with good projects were not being served because the students were not interested in those themes. Fortunately, postgraduate MA Applied Imagination students were able to work with these communities, allowing us to approach the project as intended.

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Student Engagement Crisis

Upon returning to Central Saint Martins (CSM) after the Easter break, we became aware of the scale of the crisis among BA (Hons) Product Design students. We involved the course director to refocus students who had not delivered presentations for the website. Additional tutorials helped students crystallize their ideas and begin community dialogue, though not always in the form of co-design workshops as initially anticipated.

**Challenges Faced:**
1. **Local Context Mismatch**: Some students found that the local context did not provide the opportunities they needed, leading us to look further afield for more suitable communities.
2. **Substandard Proposals**: Some student proposals were not up to standard, requiring them to start from scratch.
3. **Workload and Scheduling**: The additional workload made it difficult to meet the next deadline of April 24, 2012, for a co-design workshop.

We relaxed the requirements for the BA group and established a more flexible agenda. Despite the challenges, we managed to match all students with community groups, even if the process was not as planned.

### Community Engagement and Feedback

#### Student Feedback

Obtaining significant post-project feedback from undergraduate students has been challenging, as many have left CSM and are no longer UK residents. However, three out of twelve students provided positive feedback. For example, Lubna Jamaldin expressed an interest in becoming a social designer and was taken on as a paid intern with DACRC. Tahiya Mueen explored social enterprise and developed proposals for public and collaborative food growing via food packaging. Postgraduate students also provided very positive feedback, with the Green Camden project being a highlight of the course.

#### Resident Feedback

Not all residents provided formal feedback, but interviews revealed that some residents misunderstood the role of designers, often seeing them as "stylists" or "volunteers" rather than professionals delivering design solutions. At the exhibition in June 2012, some stakeholders were disappointed that the co-created products, services, and systems had not been implemented. For example, the compost distribution service designed for Alara Foods was not yet in place, leading to concerns from the project leader.

Some community groups, like GetMore, found the design process positive, viewing it as a networking and capacity-building activity. Camden Council was also very positive about the community engagement and the new collaboration process, which they felt would be useful for other council areas.

### Project Outputs and Exhibition

#### Prototyping and Service Systems

Many project outputs were product-service systems, with students developing design models and production drawings. Short films were created to illustrate the service systems and can be used by communities to pitch for future funding. The postgraduate students focused on creating co-design tools to build innovative capacity through collaboration.

#### Exhibition

The DESIS Green Camden exhibition featured students and residents discussing their projects and design concepts in videos. The films were created with the help of a coach from a local social enterprise hub. The exhibition was part of the student degree shows at CSM in June 2012, attracting a significant number of visitors. While the DESIS exhibition was low-key compared to other course shows, it received positive peer reviews and support from the art and design community.

### Conclusion

The DESIS Public and Collaborative project was the first where students led the co-design process with community collaborators. This approach yielded both strengths and weaknesses:

1. **Expectation Management**: Better management of expectations is needed to align the goals of the project team and partners. Future projects should involve partners with clear needs and define success metrics early on.
2. **Engagement and Setup**: More community engagement is necessary, perhaps through open and accessible activities to naturally attract interested parties. Early involvement of diverse stakeholders, including businesses and premises owners, is crucial.
3. **Evaluation**: Adequate time for evaluation and reflection is essential to ensure the project's success and to learn from the experience.

These insights will guide future projects to better align expectations, enhance community engagement, and improve the overall impact of the design interventions.
