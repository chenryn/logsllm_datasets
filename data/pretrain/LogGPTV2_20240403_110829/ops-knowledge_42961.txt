User: I run a script with inside a virtual environment like so:
python -m cron.nightly.py
Everything runs fine, but after the last line completes, I get an error:
/Users/user/.virtualenvs/vrn/bin/python: No module named cron.nightly.py
Which is fine, except that because the script doesn't exit with a 0 (I think) every time it runs Jenkins marks the job as failed and so I can't tell when the code actually fails or not without looking at each individual console output, which is not ideal to say the least.
If someone could help me explain why I get this error (there's no other traceback) and how to fix it I would really appreciate it.
Assistant: cron.knightly.py is not what you want.  Python modules do not end with .py.  Just as you wouldn't import math.py, you don't run python -m something.py.  Change it to python -m cron.nightly
