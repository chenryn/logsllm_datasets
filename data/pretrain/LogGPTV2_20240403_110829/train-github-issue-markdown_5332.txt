## Steps to Reproduce

1. I copied the code from the following example into a blank application:
   - [Minimal Internationalization Example](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/master/_includes/code/internationalization/minimal)
2. The application should display a "Hello World" message in the language of the iOS device.
3. I changed the device's language to Spanish, but the message still appears in English.
4. I then added support for the French locale and switched the device's language to French, but the message still appears in English.
5. I attempted to retrieve the current locale using the following code:
   ```dart
   Locale myLocale = Localizations.localeOf(context);
   ```
   However, it always returns `en`.
