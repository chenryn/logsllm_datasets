**TypeScript Version:**
1.8.0-beta

**Code:**
```typescript
for (const v of [1, 2, 3]);
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The compiler should generate an error indicating that the `const` variable `v` is being re-assigned within the loop.

**Actual Behavior:**
The code compiled successfully without any errors.

---

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Expected Behavior:** In a `for...of` loop, the iteration variable (`v` in this case) is expected to be re-assigned on each iteration. However, since `v` is declared with `const`, it should not be re-assignable. Therefore, the TypeScript compiler should raise an error.
- **Actual Behavior:** The TypeScript compiler did not generate an error and allowed the code to compile successfully. This suggests that the compiler may not be correctly enforcing the immutability of `const` variables in this context.
