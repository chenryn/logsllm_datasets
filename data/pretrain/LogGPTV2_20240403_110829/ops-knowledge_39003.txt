User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题diagnostics for a server that keeps turning off I have a 1U supermicro box that's a few years old and off-warranty. Recently it has begun randomly shutting down. It will stay up for anywhere from a few hours to a week and then stop responding. The IPMI console shows it as powered on but it's completely non-responsive.

I'd v much like to fix this machine as the owners are very budget constrained. It has CentOS 7 presently.

What I've looked for: 


IPMI logs - empty  
System logs - nothing relevant  
SAR - nothing interesting   
Hardware sensors - fans are on, CPU temp is nominal  


What I've tried:  


supermicro diagnostics  - the (UEFI) image won't boot properly on this system 
memtest+ - ran for 24 hours with no incident 


Given that it has redundant power supplies Im thinking this isn't the issue. This leaves CPU and mainboard. 


What other tests can I run?   
What other log sources could I look into?
What else might be failing?




Edit:

Started up said machine and let it run until it quit (12 hours?). The IPMI window shows that it's stuck on the boot page of all things.



It had been booted and running. This makes me think it's a main board issue. There aren't any USB devices plugged in and it's well and truly wedged.

Assistant: I wouldn't completely rule out the PSU. If they're redundant, you could try running with only one, then the other.

Can you get replacement CPU(s)? Used Xeons are pretty cheap, and you can still sell them afterwards. If it's a multi CPU system, try removing all but one.

Does the system have a separate, replaceable VRM for the CPU?

It could well be the mainboard, but that probably means the machine is dead.
