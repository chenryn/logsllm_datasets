- **rtCaptcha: A Real-Time CAPTCHA Based Liveness Detection System, NDSS 2018**

### Speaker Verification Cloud Services
- **Methodology:**
  - 30 seconds of genuine samples are enrolled for each subject.
  - A group with 10 people in Microsoft Cognitive Service is created.
  - Randomly selected different samples for genuine and spoofed voices are tested.

### Database
- **𝑉↓𝑑𝑛𝑛↑1−7**: Contains 7 different deep learning (DL)-based voice samples.
- **𝑉↓𝑎𝑠𝑣↑1  to 𝑉↓𝑎𝑠𝑣↑10 **: Contains genuine synthesized versions of genuine samples from two subjects, both female and male [10].
- **Samples and their voice converted (7) and synthesized (3) versions** of randomly selected 8 subjects from the ASV Spoofing Challenge database [11].

### Test Samples
| Original | Detected as Original (%) |
|----------|-------------------------|
| 𝑽↓𝒅𝒏𝒏↑𝟏−𝟕 | 60.0 |
| 𝑽↓𝒂𝒔𝒗↑𝟗 | 77.5 |
| 𝑽↓𝒂𝒔𝒗↑𝟏𝟎 | 71.3 |
| 𝑽↓𝒂𝒔𝒗↑𝟒 | 97.0 |
| 𝑽↓𝒂𝒔𝒗↑𝟓 | 100.0 |
| 𝑽↓𝒂𝒔𝒗↑𝟔 | 81.3 |
| 𝑽↓𝒂𝒔𝒗↑𝟕 | 28.8 |
| 𝑽↓𝒂𝒔𝒗↑𝟖 | 47.5 |

## Proposed System
- **Fundamental Problem of Existing Schemes:**
  - Predictable challenges.
  - Security relies on audio/face analysis, which has endless improvement in adversarial settings.

- **Real-Time Captcha (rtCaptcha):**
  - Randomized challenges.
  - Security relies on an existing liveness detection mechanism.

### System Overview
- **Authentication Request:**
  - Send CAPTCHA challenge.
  - Display CAPTCHA.
  - Get voice response.
  - Capture face.
  - If response time ≤ human threshold and CAPTCHA response matches, verify face and voice.
  - If verified, authenticate.

## User Study
- **Challenges:**
  - Plaintext – Numeric and Phrases
  - Numeric CAPTCHAs – reCaptcha, Ebay, Yandex
  - Animated Phrase CAPTCHAs – reCaptcha
  - Blink/Smile Challenge

| Challenge Type | Accuracy (1 trial) (%) | Accuracy (2 trials) (%) | Response Time (seconds) |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Plain-text CAPTCHA | 90.3 | 100.0 | 0.77 |
| Smile/Blink | 88.8 | 98.4 | 0.93 |
| Animated Phrase CAPTCHA | 85.5 | 100.0 | 5.01 |

## CAPTCHA Breaking/Solving Attacks
- **Human Users (Hum↓au↓d):** Users in our user study.
- **Atc↓typ:** Man-powered CAPTCHA solving services [12].
- **Atc↓ocr:** OCR-based CAPTCHA decoding services [13].
- **Atc↓best:** State-of-the-art CAPTCHA breaking tool [14].

| CAPTCHA Scheme | Recognition Accuracy (%) | Response Time (seconds) |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| reCaptcha_numeric | 87.1 | 0.90 |
| Ebay_numeric | 96.7 | 22.11 |
| Yandex_numeric | 0 | 2.98 |
| reCaptcha_phrase | 77.2 | 10.27 |

## Conclusions
- Smile/blink detection is weak against spoofing.
- rtCaptcha combines audio/image analysis with CAPTCHA.
- rtCaptcha provides very limited time to:
  - Break the CAPTCHA.
  - Synthesize the victim's voice/face.
- Limitation: rtCaptcha requires an audible response, which may not be usable in certain environments.
