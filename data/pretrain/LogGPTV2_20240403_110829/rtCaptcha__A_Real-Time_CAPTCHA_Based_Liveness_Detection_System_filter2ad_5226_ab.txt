◉  Microsoft Cognitive Services 
Methodology 
◉  30 seconds of genuine samples are enrolled 
for each subject. Hence, a group with 10 
people in MS Cognitive Service is created. 
◉  Randomly selected different samples for 
genuine and spoofed voices are tested.  
Database ◉ ​𝑉↓𝑑𝑛𝑛↑1−7 : Contain 7 different DL-based 
◉ ​𝑉↓𝑎𝑠𝑣↑1  to ​𝑉↓𝑎𝑠𝑣↑10 : Contain genuine 
synthesized version of genuine samples from 
two subjects, both female and male [10]. 
samples and their voice converted (7) and 
synthesized (3) versions of randomly 
selected 8 subjects from ASV Spoofing 
Challenge database [11].

Fundamental Problem of Existing Schemes  
◉  Predictable challenges. 
◉  Security relies on audio/face analysis, which has 
endless improvement in adversarial settings. 
Real-Time Captcha (rtCaptcha) 
◉  Randomized challenges. 
◉  Security relies on an existing liveness detection 
mechanism.

Conclusion 
Conclusions 
◉  Smile/blink etc. detection is weak against spoofing. 
◉  rtCaptcha: Audio/image analysis à CAPTCHA 
◉  rtCaptcha: Very limited time to; 
 * Break Captcha 
 * Synthesize voice/face of the victim. 
◉  Limitation: rtCaptcha needs audible response, which could NOT be 
usable in certain environments.
