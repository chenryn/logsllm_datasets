User: I installed Python 3.5 from source and broke a number of modules on Python 3.4, which unfortunately, was an essential part of Ubuntu. I've been trying to fix the system, now I'm almost there, with (hopefully) the last problem: My Python 3.4 only recognize C modules with name *.cpython-34m.so, while all packages from Ubuntu repository are named *.cpython-34m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so. It seems that the cpython-34m stuff is the full name of Python, so I need to change it in accord with Ubuntu's expectation. How can I achieve this?
Assistant: What you are trying makes no sense.  The name cannot be changed, for a good reason.  The reason the names are different is to prevent incompatible versions from mixing up each other.  You can compile a different version with different options and then the name will be different, too.
