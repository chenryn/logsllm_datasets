ported for wired broadband access, with a great deal of variation
depending on local service provider. The higher variability present
with wireless access performance is likely due to variability in sig-
nal quality, deployment density of base stations and cell towers, and
suboptimally designed service provider backhaul infrastructure, in-
cluding distant placement of cellular gateway nodes [31].
4.2 Temporal Characteristics of Performance
Our temporal analysis begins by analyzing the frequency of use
of the Speedtest application in the target regions. Figure 7 shows
the number of hourly invocations of the application for cellular and
WiFi over a two week period for six representative metro areas.
The ﬁgures clearly show the characteristic diurnal pattern for each
region and technology. We see that there are many hundreds of
invocations of the Speedtest app per day in larger metro areas, but
that the measurements are fairly sparse in smaller metro areas, with
typically fewer than 10 invocations of the Speedtest applications
per hour in Lawrence, KS. Lastly, we observe that in some markets
there are similar numbers of invocations of the app over WiFi and
cellular access (e.g., New York, NY and Los Angeles, CA), but
major differences in other markets (e.g., Manchester, UK).
Next, we analyze the temporal characteristics of upload and down-
load performance for cellular and WiFi. Figure 8 shows the hourly
average upload and download performance for each technology
over a 6 day period for one metro area from each of the ﬁve area
types (notice the different y-axis scales for cellular (top) and WiFi
(bottom)). We observe that for cellular access, the performance
for all but the largest metro area is fairly similar over time; perfor-
mance for the New York, NY region clearly stands above the oth-
ers. This trend is similar for other metro areas in the ﬁve area types.
The latency proﬁles in Table 5 and Figure 5 suggest that the better
engineered cellular infrastructure for some providers in large metro
areas has a clear impact on throughput performance. We observe
that for WiFi connections, while the smallest metro areas have gen-
erally lower throughputs, the differences are not as great among the
metro areas for WiFi as they are for cellular connections.
In other results (not shown due to space constraints), we observe
that performance in the largest metro areas is better during non-
peak hours (i.e., early morning hours) than for other times of day.
For other metro areas, there is no statistically signiﬁcant difference
in measured performance between peak and non-peak hours. We
note that in Sundaresan et al. [33], the authors observed a distinct
performance difference in peak versus off-peak hours, due to net-
work load. We do not observe such a strong characteristic because
of the signiﬁcantly lower degree of performance consistency we see
in our data.
Main ﬁndings.
We ﬁnd higher throughput performance over time for larger metro
areas, further supporting the notion that service providers expend
more effort to engineer networks in more populous locations. We
ﬁnd some evidence for higher performance during off-peak hours
and lower performance during peak hours, though to a lesser degree
than has been reported for wired broadband access. The cause for
this difference is likely due to the higher overall variability present

and WiFi uploads (bottom right) for exemplars in each of the metro areas during April 24 to April 30, 2011.
in wireless access performance resulting from frequency band con-
tention and overbuffering at edge routers.
4.3 Spatial Analysis of Subregion of Perfor-
mance
Our spatial analysis of subregions within metro areas begins by
considering spatial performance variations using the entire 15 week
data set. To generate our plots below, we apply an inverse distance
weighting interpolation [32] to the performance measurements over
a region. Pixels are colored according to interpolated performance.
In the plots below, we apply the following color symbology to up-
load/download performance:  2 Mb/s: indigo. We
apply this same symbology for both upload and download perfor-
mance in order to make the plots visually comparable.
Figure 9 shows plots of interpolated upload performance for WiFi
(top) and cell (bottom) for three different metro regions (Chicago,
IL, Manchester, UK, and Lawrence, KS, left to right, respectively)
over the 15 week data set. The plots show that upload performance
is spatially variable. Since the plot is produced from the entire 15
week data collection period, regions in which the color is yellow
or red suggest that there are subareas with consistently poor perfor-
mance.
We also observe that although WiFi upload performance is broadly,
on average, at least twice as fast as cellular performance (c.f. Ta-
ble 4), the spatial performance characteristics reveal a much more
complex picture. For the Chicago, IL metro area, we observe that
WiFi upload performance is better across the entire region. How-
ever, when examining the Manchester, UK plots, we observe a clear
separation in WiFi upload performance between areas closer to
the city center and surrounding, more rural, areas. Although that
pattern is somewhat less clear with cellular upload performance
in Manchester, the areas of highest performance still generally lie
closer to the Manchester city center, with larger and more preva-
lent areas of poor performance in surrounding, less urban, areas.
A similar observation holds for the Lawrence, KS metro area and
other areas (not shown). (Note that since the Chicago, IL metro
area is extremely large, this pattern is not observable in the plots
shown. Expanding the plotted region reveals poorer performance
further away from the city center.)
We note that plots of download performance reveal similar vari-
ability in performance: there are subareas with consistently poor
performance, and subareas that exhibit good performance. In future
work, we intend to further examine spatial performance character-
istics, and utilize available cell tower and WiFi maps, along with
economic and population data, to drill down on the likely causes
for the observed performance characteristics.
Main ﬁndings.
We see a high degree of spatial performance variability, with
some metro areas exhibiting performance degradation as one moves
further away from the metro area center. Observed performance
differences are likely due to cellular tower and WiFi base station
placement, and density of placements, as well as local contention
due to load.

5. RELATED WORK
There is a large and growing body of work that examines the be-
havior and characteristics of WiFi networks. Studies that are most
closely related to ours have been focused on analyzing mobile use
characteristics in live deployments. Birk et al. analyze the behavior
and characteristics of a city-wide commercial WiFi mesh network
in [13]. Their study is based on a diverse set of measurements of
a 250 node mesh operated by a single provider. Their assessment
of client performance was based on a set of targeted active mea-
surements, and showed temporal variations with peak performance
achieved during the day (since customers are primarily residential)
in contrast to wireline networks. In a related study, Sen et al. pro-
pose a framework for client-assisted active measurement of wide-
area wireless networks [30]. Similar empirical studies of WiFi be-
havior in localized settings include [9, 15, 22, 27]. More recently,
LaCurts and Balakrishnan report results of an empirical study of
110 different WiFi mesh networks in diverse markets around the
world [25]. While their study reveals a range of characteristics of
these networks, it does not address client performance, which is our
focus. While all of the aforementioned studies expand the body of
knowledge on WiFi behavior, our work differs in objective, scope,
measurement details and the fact that we include analysis of cellu-
lar performance.
There is also a growing literature on empirical studies of cellu-
lar networks. Tan et al. describe one of the ﬁrst empirical studies
of 3G cellular networks in [34]. Their work is focused in a single
large metro area and includes an examination of client through-
put and other performance characteristics using measurements of
data transfers between a small set of smartphones and their servers.
Their results show a wide range of variable behaviors (diurnal pat-
terns, expanded RTT’s during peak hours, etc.)
that are consis-
tent with a number of our observations. Other empirical studies
of behavior in cellular networks include [24, 26, 31]. More re-
cently, there have been several studies focused on smartphone per-
formance. Falaki et al. use measurements from instrumented hand-
sets to study diversity in smartphone trafﬁc characteristics [20],
while Huang et al. use a purpose-built application deployed on
a large number of handsets to study smartphone application perfor-
mance [23]. Shaﬁq et al. [31] and Elmokashﬁ et al. [18] recently
examined cellular network performance characteristics. One par-
ticularly interesting ﬁnding from these studies is the impact that
the topology of the cellular backhaul network plays in performance.
Our work differs from these in its scope and focus on comparative
analysis of cellular and WiFi.
There are several prior studies that investigate cellular and WiFi
performance simultaneously. The notion of the combined use of
cellular and WiFi in a vehicular setting is addressed in [10]. That
study considers cellular and WiFi availability in three cities as the
basis for their work. In [17], Deshpande et al. evaluate cellular
and WiFi performance in the New York metro area, also in a ve-
hicular setting. Measurements are taken with a laptop that is driven
throughout the target area, which enables highly targeted spatio-
temporal tests. Their results highlight the widely available, lower
performance characteristics of cellular versus the lower availabil-
ity, higher performance characteristics of WiFi. While there are
similarities between these studies and our own, our results comple-
ment and expand the prior work by reporting client performance in
diverse markets using a larger body of crowd-sourced data.
cellular and WiFi in metro areas, our current results suggest several
conclusions about mobile performance. First, while WiFI offers
superior download performance, the relatively predictable level of
cellular performance for some network providers, coupled with its
ubiquity make it a compelling option for all but the most bandwidth
hungry apps. With the rollout of improve throughput access tech-
nologies like LTE, it may become the preferred option for wireless
connectivity. Second, the stability and performance of both tech-
nologies in larger markets suggests that performance would be en-
hanced by further build out of both WiFi and cellular infrastructure
in smaller markets.
In future work we plan to continue our investigation of Speedtest
data. Speciﬁcally, we plan to expand the scope of study by con-
sidering additional markets. We also intend to drill down on the
data in greater detail in order to better understand variations in
performance, e.g., by considering related datasets such as weather
conditions during test periods and cell tower/WiFi access point
locations. We also plan to investigate hypotheses posed in this
paper concerning provider backhaul infrastructure and its impact
on access performance, overbuffering in access routers, and wire-
less access contention. We are considering how to augment the
Speedtest measurement protocol in order to better understand these
and other performance observations. Finally, we plan to conduct
targeted, hypothesis-driven experiments in different markets using
the Speedtest application, again toward the goal of understanding
the root causes of observed performance results.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Cellular and 802.11 WiFi are the de facto connectivity options
for today’s mobile users. The increasing availability of handsets
and tablets that offer both connectivity options coupled with the
the explosion of applications that demand high performance means
that users are sensitive to throughput performance for each technol-
ogy. In this paper, we present a measurement study of cellular and
WiFi performance using crowd-sourced data from the widely used
throughput testing application, Speedtest.net.
Our results reveal a wide range of characteristics of cellular and
WiFi performance. The raw comparison between the two tech-
nologies shows that WiFi provides superior download performance,
with maximum WiFi performance varying widely. The difference
in upload performance is much smaller, yet is also highly variable.
We also ﬁnd that WiFi latency measurements are at least a factor
of two lower than cell latency in all areas, but the consistency in
latency is often better with cellular access. Overall, we ﬁnd perfor-
mance consistency for wireless access networks to be much lower
than has been previously reported for wired networks. Temporal
analysis reveals that performance is sensitive to time of day in the
largest metro areas, with performance decreasing for both cellu-
lar and WiFi during the hours of peak use. Comparisons between
metro areas shows that larger markets provide a consistently higher
level of performance for both technologies, suggesting greater en-
gineering effort and resources deployed in more populous regions.
However, analysis within more localized regions shows high vari-
ability in performance for both technologies in all markets.
