I have hosted Google App Engine (GAE) applications using two different email addresses. When I initially used `appcfg.py` to update my application, it prompted me for an email address and password. However, in subsequent updates, it no longer prompts for these credentials. How can I change the saved email address and password?

I attempted to use the `--email=` flag with `appcfg.py`, but it did not work.

Additionally, Adam Bernier's solution can also be applied when using `appcfg.py download_app` to download an application from the App Engine servers.
