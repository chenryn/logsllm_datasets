User: I have hosted GAE apps with two different email ids! When i first time used appcfg.py to update my app then it prompted me for email id and password but later it doesnot. How to i change the saved email id and password? I tried to use --email= flag with appcfg.py, but it dint worked.
Assistant: Answer of Adam Bernier also can apply when you use the 
appcfg.py download_app for downloading app from appengine servers.
