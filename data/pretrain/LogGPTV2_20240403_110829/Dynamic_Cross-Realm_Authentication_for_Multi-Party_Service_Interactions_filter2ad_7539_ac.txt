state  information  is  stored  in  resources.  A  service 
instance  can  be  thus  located  when  the  corresponding 
resource is found. In ES1, the identifier of an instance 
and  its  associated  private  key  are  stored  within  a 
resource, and the instance identifier is identical to the 
resource identifier. 
4.1 Worst Case Evaluation  
We  have  deployed  the  experimental  systems  both 
on a single computer and on a distributed system with 
multiple  computers.  Particularly,  we  deploy 
the 
experimental  systems  on  a  single  computer  for  two 
reasons.  
• 
In  order  to  evaluate  precisely  the  overhead 
introduced by the authentication protocols (e.g. 
generating  key  pairs,  generating  MACs  for 
messages etc.), we need to remove the influence 
introduced  by 
time  consumption  of 
the 
transporting messages.

stable  state  until  over  16,000  instances are  generated. 
The performance decreases after then, and the system 
finally stops due to the lack of the memory space.

ES1 is used to simulate distributed applications that 
use  the  multi-party  authentication  system  whilst  ES2 
simulates  distributed  applications  without  the  multi-
party  authentication  system.  The  experimental  results 
of  ES2  are  used  as  benchmarks.  By  comparing  the 
experimental  results  obtained  from  both  experimental 
systems, we can assess the overheads imposed by our 
authentication system.

level  security  protocols,  Secure  Conversation  and 
Secure Message, provided by GT4. In the experiment 
illustrated in Figure 7, the secure conversation protocol 
is  used  to  generate  signatures  for  every  message 
transported  in  ES1.  The  time  consumption  of  the 
experimental  system  starts  to  increase  non-linearly 
after  over  720  instances  are  generated.  The  same 
phenomenon  occurs  in ES2  after  over  1040  instances 
are  generated  when  ES2  is  deployed  with  the  secure 
conversation protocol.

As  illustrated  in  Figures  7  and  8,  the  time 
consumption  of  ES1  is  about  twice  that  of  ES2 
although  ES1  provides  sufficient  support  for  session 
authentication  operations.  These  experimental  results 
also  indicate  that  the  scalability  of  the  experimental 
systems  is  affected  significantly  by  the  security 
protocols combined with the experimental systems.

In  order  to  avoid  generating  GT4-oriented  results 
only, we also implement our design in the large-scale 
CROWN 
and  Development 
environment  Over  Wide-area  Network)  Grid  [19]. 
CROWN is a practical Grid system, aiming to promote 
the utilisation of valuable resources and cooperation of 
researchers 
and  world-wide.  The 
experimental  results  are  presented  in  Figure  9.  The 
time  consumption  of  ES1  is about  twice  that  of  ES2. 
This is very similar to what observed in the GT4-based 
experiments.  However,  as  the  computer  used  by 
CROWN is much more powerful, the performance of 
our  experimental  systems  becomes  much  better.  The 
experimental  systems  can  stay  in  a  stable  state  until 
over 260,000 instances are generated. 
4.2 Distributed Deployment 
The  performance  of  the  experimental  systems  is 
improved significantly when deployed in a distributed 
environment  with  multiple  computers.  In  the  GT4-
based  experiments,  the  time  consumption  of  ES1 
without  combining  other  security  protocols  increases 
linearly  until  more  than  70,000  new  instances  are 
generated.  When 
the  secure 
conversation  protocol,  ES1  executes  stably  until  over 
3,000  instances  are  generated.  As  an  example  of 
distributed deployment, the experimental results based 
on  CROWN  are  presented  in  Figure  10.  The  time 
consumption  of  ES1  is  proportional to  the number  of 
the  newly  generated  instances  until  over  300,000 
instances are generated.
