User: I'm trying to make a Python script run as a service.
It need to work and run automatically after a reboot.
I have tried to copy it inside the init.d folder, But without any luck.
Can anyone help?(if it demands a cronjob, i haven't configured one before, so i would be glad if you could write how to do it)
(Running Centos)
Assistant: There is no intrinsic reason why Python should be different from any other scripting language here.
Here is someone else using python in init.d: blog.scphillips.com/posts/2013/07/â€¦ In fact, that deals with a lot that I don't deal with here, so I recommend just following that post.
