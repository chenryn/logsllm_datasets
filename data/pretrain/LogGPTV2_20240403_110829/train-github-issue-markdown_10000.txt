I would like to highlight an issue that has not been receiving any responses despite multiple @ mentions. The problem is detailed in FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle#747. If there is a more effective way to bring such matters to attention, I would appreciate being informed.

To provide some context, here is a quote from @stof:
> "The remember me services are marked as private and, as a result, they are removed during the container optimization process. This leads to the `has` checks in the `LoginManager` returning `false`, even when the 'remember me' feature is enabled for the firewall."
