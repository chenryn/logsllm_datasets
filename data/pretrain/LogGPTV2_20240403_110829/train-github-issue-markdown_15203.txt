The option `static_folder` for blueprints only works correctly when the
blueprint has been registered with a `url_prefix`, otherwise the application's
default static URL takes precedence.
There is nothing wrong in that behavior, but it is not documented. It would be
nice to have that fact mentioned at
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/blueprints/#static-files and/or
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/api/#blueprint-objects
