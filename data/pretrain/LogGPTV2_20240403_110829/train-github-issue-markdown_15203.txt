The `static_folder` option for blueprints in Flask functions correctly only when the blueprint is registered with a `url_prefix`. If no `url_prefix` is specified, the application's default static URL takes precedence over the blueprint's static folder. 

While this behavior is not inherently problematic, it is currently undocumented. It would be beneficial to include this information in the official Flask documentation, specifically at the following locations:
- [Static Files in Blueprints](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/blueprints/#static-files)
- [Blueprint Objects](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/api/#blueprint-objects)

This addition would help developers understand and use the `static_folder` option more effectively.
