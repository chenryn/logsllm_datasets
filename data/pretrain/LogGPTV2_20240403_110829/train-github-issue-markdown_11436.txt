**Migrated Issue, Originally Created by Mrudula Chougule**

Hello,

I am working on a Python + GTK application and am currently in the process of porting it from Ubuntu 10.04 to 14.04. On Ubuntu 14.04, I have SQLAlchemy version 0.8.4-1Ubuntu2.1 installed. When I attempt to run my application and it tries to insert a column into the database, I encounter the following error:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.CompileError: Unconsumed column name
```

Could you please provide any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this issue? I am currently unable to proceed.

Thank you,
Mrudula
