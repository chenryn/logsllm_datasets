User: What is the concurrency control mechanism of PostgreSQL? What are the pros and cons?
Assistant: PostgreSQL's concurrency control mechanism includes many aspects, such as locks and MVCC. Among them, lock is one of the traditional concurrency control mechanisms, which is used to control access to shared resources. PostgreSQL provides multiple levels of locks, such as row-level locks, page-level locks, and table-level locks. Different levels of locks have different advantages and disadvantages, and specific applications need to be selected according to specific scenarios. MVCC is a unique concurrency control mechanism of PostgreSQL, which implements concurrency control by recording transaction version information. Each transaction can only see the previously committed version, so different transactions can read the same table concurrently without interfering with each other. During the write operation, MVCC will create a new version information and write the new value to achieve transaction isolation. In terms of advantages, PostgreSQL's concurrency control mechanism performs well under high concurrency conditions, and there will be no problems such as deadlocks and conflicts. At the same time, the implementation of MVCC makes the read and write operations not be blocked when the read and write operations are performed at the same time. On the downside, due to the need to record version information, PostgreSQL consumes more storage space to a certain extent. At the same time, the implementation of locks will involve resource competition and waiting issues, which may lead to performance degradation.
