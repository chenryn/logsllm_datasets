User: I am using Windows 10 and have Python installed. The new update brought bash to windows, but when I call python from inside bash, it refers to the Python installation which came with the bash, not to my Python installed on Windows. So, for example, I can't use the modules which I have already installed on Windows and would have to install them separately on the bash installation.
How can I (and can I?) make bash point to my original Windows Python installation? I see that in /usr/bin I have a lot of links with "python" inside their name, but I am unsure which ones to change, and if changing them to Windows directories would even work because of different executable formats.
Assistant: You have at least four options:

Specify the complete absolute path to the python executable you want to use.
Define an alias in your .bashrc file
Modify the PATH variable in your .bashrc file to include the location of the python version you wish to use.
Create a symlink in a directory which is already in your PATH.
