Step 3: Write the playbook file Write the list of tasks you want to perform in the playbook file. For example, you can write a task list to install the Apache web server, configure virtual hosts and firewall rules, etc. You can use Ansible's predefined modules to perform these tasks, or you can write custom modules to perform specific tasks. Step 4: Run the playbook Execute the ansible-playbook command on the control node and specify the playbook file and hosts file. Ansible will automatically execute the task list on all specified servers. For example, the following command will run the playbook file named webserver.yml and execute the task on all servers in the hostgroup named web: ``` bash ansible-playbook -i hosts webserver.yml -l web ``` Summary : Use Ansible automation tool to quickly deploy a set of web servers. By writing a playbook file, you can easily perform a series of tasks, such as installing a Web server, configuring virtual hosts and firewall rules, and so on. This greatly simplifies the deployment process, saving time and effort.
