Table 7: Number of sources for which we can detect path changes
throughout our measurement periods is consistent across datasets.
large ASes (announcing a /16 or more) are more likely always-
analyzable, half of the always-analyzable sources are small (an-
nounce less than a /16 block).
Validation. We validate our method using historical traceroutes
from Ark nodes [6] located in always-detectable ASes in UCSD-13.
The Ark infrastructure uses teams of about 20 nodes to send tracer-
outes to every routed /24 block over a span of 2-3 days [6]; thus, we
can expect about one traceroute per minute from each Ark node to
reach the darknet. Nine Ark nodes are in 8 always-detectable ASes,
including ﬁve educational networks, two large transit providers,
and a Regional Internet Registry.
We cannot validate all path changes from the hosts sending IBR,
as we do not know when these hosts start sharing links to the dark-
net. However, AS-level path changes should be observable in both
Ark data and IBR. We ﬁnd our analysis of other IBR-transmitting
IP addresses frequently corroborates path changes in traceroute data.
Figure 11 reports, for events in KIST (ASN1237) and Purdue (AS17),
the percentage of hosts in darknet data signaling a path change, and
the periods of time (the colored) periods that a path change was ob-
served from IPs in both darknet and traceroute data.
KIST had very few path changes (in both types of data). Fig-
ure 11a includes all traceroute-inferred path changes for KIST, and
all but one path change in UCSD-13. Most traceroute-inferred
path changes occur around the same time as the darknet-inferred
changes. Traceroute reveals that the path change occurred in the
core of the network. Further investigation of the KIST sources sug-
gests that trafﬁc from the darknet sources used multiple paths in
the 8:00 to 8:10 time bins (during these time bins the hop count
was 16 or 17; outside of the time bins the hop count was 16). For
one of the IP addresses, it is possible to look at a 1-minute time
bins. With this granularity all darknet-inferred changes align with
traceroute-inferred changes.
Figure 11b shows many path changes over a six-day period for
Purdue in both Ark (8.9k changes), and darknet data (1.3k 5 minute
bins with changes). Several IP addresses produce evidence of fre-
quent path changes. Before August 4, 2013, traceroutes sent by the
Ark monitor to UCSD-NT used the same route out of Purdue, but
after this date, trafﬁc from the Ark node traversed multiple routes
out of Purdue’s network. A likely explanation is that some Purdue
sources used stable routes, while others used ﬂapping routes; on
August 4, 2013 the Ark node switched to using the ﬂapping routes.
It is future work to fully validate our method; but from these
examples, we suspect our technique can provide strong evidence
of paths changes to the darknet. At a high level, our results for
path-change detectable ASes are consistent with previous studies
of route persistence [19, 42].
Discussion. Although IBR is an erratic data source, this example
shows that it can provide insight into abnormal events and macro-
scopic dynamics. Our success with this case study is partially due
to the aspect of IBR we are evaluating:
the expectation that the
initial TTL value remains the same is true regardless of the num-
ber of sources sending IBR or the volume of IBR, although in-

each ﬁgure shades, for each source, the periods it inferred a path change. The bottom portion of each ﬁgure shows the percentage of darknet

creases in either would likely improve our coverage and accuracy.
This path change detection method would work best in conjunction
with other data sources. Like PlanetSeer and Hubble, passive trafﬁc
measurements such as IBR can help inform when and where active
measurements would be most useful [31, 51]. IBR also provides
features that traceroute and BGP data lack, e.g., no injected trafﬁc
required, and intra-AS visibility, respectively.
9. SUMMARY
We create a framework, and use case studies to apply the frame-
work, to investigate the utility of Internet Background Radiation to
support inference of a range of properties of networks across the
global Internet. Using trafﬁc from two large darknets, we care-
fully characterize it along dimensions applicable to macroscopic
Internet measurements. We examine which networks send IBR,
identify components that enable opportunistic network inferences,
characterize the frequency and granularity of trafﬁc sources, and
analyze sensitivity to time of collection and position in the address
space. Three case studies highlight the range of inferences pos-
sible with IBR, and show that IBR can supplement existing tech-
niques by improving coverage and/or diversity of analyzable net-
works, and reducing measurement overhead. We also taxonomize
10 other potential inferences, and hope that our framework encour-
ages additional consideration of the circumstances and properties
for which unsolicited trafﬁc is an appropriate data source for Inter-
net research. This work demonstrates the applicability of IBR to
many types of Internet measurement studies. More generally, this
framework can serve as a template for evaluating the utility of other
Internet measurement data sources.
