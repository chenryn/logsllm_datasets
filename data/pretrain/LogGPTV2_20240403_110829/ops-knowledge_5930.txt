User: I would like to be able to gather the values for number of CPUs on a server and stuff like storage space etc and assign them to local variables in a python script. I have paramiko set up, so I can SSH to remote Linux nodes and run arbitrary commands on them, and then have the output returned to the script. However, many commands are very verbose "such as df -h", when all I want to assign is a single integer or value. 
For the case of number of CPUs, there is Python functionality such as through the psutil module to get this value. Such as 'psutil.NUM_CPUS' which returns an integer. However, while I can run this locally, I can't exactly execute it on remote nodes as they don't have the python environment configured. 
I am wondering how common it is to manually parse output of linux commands (such as df -h etc) and then grab an integer from it (similar to how bash has a "cut" function). Or whether it is somehow better to set up an environment on each remote server (or a better way).
Assistant: If you can put your own programs or scripts on the remote machine there are a couple of things you can do:

Write a script on the remote machine that outputs just what you want, and execute that over ssh.
Use ssh to tunnel a port on the other machine and communicate with a server on the remote machine which will respond to requests for information with the data you want over a socket.
