# Bug report
## Describe the bug
I have a monorepo usecase, where I want to share code between the next app and
other modules that are located outside of the app folder.
It will end up with this error:
    { Error: (client) ../foo.ts 1:0
    Module parse failed: The keyword 'interface' is reserved (1:0)
    You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
    > interface Foo {
    |   prop: string;
    | }
     @ ./pages/index.tsx 4:0-28 8:5-8
     @ multi ./pages/index.tsx
## To Reproduce
I have set up a simple repo here, based on the next-typescript example:
https://github.com/Swatinem/next-monorepo/tree/master
## Expected behavior
Whatever I import should be transpiled like everything else, period.
