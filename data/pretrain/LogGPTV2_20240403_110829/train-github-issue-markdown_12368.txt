### Environment
  * Dubbo version: 2.7.1
  * Operating System version: ANY
  * Java version: ANY
### Steps to reproduce this issue
Duboo 2.7.x changes package to org.apache.dubbo.  
So when collecting monitor data through `MonitorService` interface instances
under `2.7` use new interface subscription while old ones still use old one.
Dubbo 2.7 keep some interfaces ensuring backward compatibility including
`Service`/`Reference`/etc. . But `MonitorService` is not included.
Is that an issue?
I copy the old interface into my receiver project to collect data from old
dubbo clients.
### Expected Result
Old MonitorService should be kept.
And there is another error log i don't know whether it's a bug.
