BGP burstiness. Several works [15, 23, 45, 48] focused on bursts of
BGP messages with the goal of studying per-prefix instabilities and
dynamics. They define an update burst as a sequence of messages
pertaining to a single prefix and observed within a given timeout.
Our goal with SWIFT is different, as we focus on events generating
concurrent withdrawals related to distinct prefixes.
Fast data-plane updates. Several techniques can speed up for-
warding rule modification upon local failures. For example, MPLS
fast reroute [51], IP fast reroute [11, 60] and PIC [25] can react in
sub-second to local link failures by pre-provisioning backup entries
and selectively activate them at runtime. SDN approaches, like Fat-
Tire [56], support the same use case in OpenFlow. None of these
works can fast reroute upon remote failures—as SWIFT does.
9 CONCLUSION
We presented SWIFT, the first fast-reroute framework for remote
outages. SWIFT is based on two key contributions: (i) a fast and
accurate inference algorithm; and (ii) a novel encoding scheme.
We performed a thorough evaluation of SWIFT using a fully
functional implementation and real BGP data. Our results indicate
that SWIFT is efficient in practice: it achieves a prediction accuracy
and an encoding efficiency both above 90%, and can boost the
convergence performance of a Cisco router by up to 98%.

SWIFT: Predictive Fast Reroute
(a) A SWIFTED Cisco router converge
98% faster.
(b) Alternative SWIFT implementation on
existing router.
Figure 9: While a recent router takes 110 seconds to con-
verge upon a large remote outage (left), the corresponding
SWIFTED router (using the alternative deployment scheme
depicted on the right) converges within 2 seconds.
Upon the detection of a burst coming from a peer, the SWIFT
controller runs the inference algorithm (§4), and provisions data-
plane rules to the SDN switch for rerouting the traffic. Our SWIFT
controller uses ExaBGP [7] to maintain BGP sessions.
Methodology. We reproduced the topology in Fig. 1(a) with a re-
cent router (Cisco Nexus 7k C7018, running NX-OS v6.2) acting
as AS 1, which we connected to its peers via a laptop running a
(software-based) OpenFlow switch (OpenVSwitch 2.1.3). We con-
figured AS 6 to announce 290k prefixes. Then, we failed the link
(5, 6), and we measured the downtime using the same technique as
in §2 (sending traffic to 100 randomly selected IP addresses).
A 98% speed-up. Fig. 9(a) reports the downtime observed by the
SWIFTED and non-SWIFTED Cisco router. While the vanilla Cisco
router takes 109 s to converge, the SWIFTED Cisco router system-
atically converges within 2 s—a 98% speed-up.
8 RELATED WORK
Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Many prior works aim at identifying
the root cause of failures, be it in the Internet [14, 15, 19, 23, 35, 38,
39, 67–69], or within a network [20, 40, 58, 66]. SWIFT inference
algorithm differs from previous works both in objectives and scope.
To enable fast rerouting, SWIFT inference should be extremely
quick (in seconds or sub-seconds), while previous works typically
focus on a much longer timescale (minutes). Moreover, SWIFT deals
with a specific type of failures, those generating large bursts of BGP
withdrawals, and only rely on the BGP messages reaching a single
vantage point (the SWIFTED router). In contrast, previous RCA
efforts typically use active measurements and multiple vantage
points. They also focus on pinpointing different problems such as
per-prefix path changes [35] or failures on the reverse path [38].
Another important difference is that SWIFT actually uses its
fast RCA core to repair Internet connectivity problems (almost in
real time). Doing so goes beyond previous contributions, like [33],
which only show how to detect (not repair) path problems out of
passive packet-level traces collected from a single vantage point.
BGP convergence. Slow BGP convergence is a well-known prob-
lem [17, 22, 29, 43, 44, 47]. Most prior work aimed at reducing BGP
convergence time within a single domain, for instance, upon planned

APPENDIX
A DETAILED INFERENCE ALGORITHM
Algorithm 1 depicts our implementation of the SWIFT link infer-
ence algorithm. The algorithm is launched during a burst of BGP
withdrawals and takes as parameter G, the AS graph seen when
the algorithm is launched, GW the graph of withdrawn AS paths,
and Wtotal the current size of the burst. G (resp. GW ) are weighted
based on the number of prefixes traversing (resp. that traversed be-
fore the burst and are now withdrawn) their links. For each node in
GW , the algorithm sorts its ongoing links based on their individual
FS score. Then, it repeatedly merges the outgoing links, starting
from the one with the highest FS score, and recomputes the new
FS score of this set of links. As soon as merging a new outgoing
