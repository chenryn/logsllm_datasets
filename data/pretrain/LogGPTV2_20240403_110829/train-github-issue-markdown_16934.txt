#12278 was originally about this, but was changed to be about go/build.
go/build and x/tools/go/loader now know about vendor directories, but there is
more work to do to make goimports add the correct paths.
When working on `$GOPATH/src/a` that vendors `b`, instead of adding the
(disallowed) import `"a/vendor/b"`, goimports should add `"b"`.
