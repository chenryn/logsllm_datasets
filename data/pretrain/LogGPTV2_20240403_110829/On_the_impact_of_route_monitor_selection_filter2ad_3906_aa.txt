ABSTRACT
Several route monitoring systems have been set up to help under-
stand the Internet routing system. They operate by gathering real-
time BGP updates from different networks. Many studies have re-
lied on such data sources by assuming reasonably good coverage
and thus representative visibility into the Internet routing system.
However, different deployment strategies of route monitors directly
impact the accuracy and generality of conclusions.
Our work is the ﬁrst to critically examine the visibility con-
straints imposed by the deployment of route monitors on various
applications. We study the difference due to diverse deployment
schemes on three important classes of applications: (1) discovery
of relatively stable Internet properties such as the AS topology and
preﬁx to origin AS mappings, (2) discovery of dynamic routing
behavior such as IP preﬁx hijack attacks and routing instability,
and (3) inference of important network properties such as AS rela-
tionships and AS-level paths. We study several simple schemes of
route monitor selection and provide insights on improving monitor
placement.

INTRODUCTION
There exist several public route monitoring systems, such as
Route Views [1] and RIPE [2], which have been deployed to help
understand and monitor the Internet routing system. These mon-
itoring systems operate by gathering real-time BGP updates and
periodic BGP table snapshots from various ISP backbones and net-
work locations to discover dynamic changes of the global Internet
routing system. Various research studies have been conducted re-
lying on these data, including network topology discovery [3], AS
relationship inference [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], AS-level path prediction [9,
10], BGP root cause analysis [11], and several routing anomaly de-
tection schemes. Most of them process the routing updates from
the route monitoring system to study the dynamic routing behavior.

These studies relying on BGP routing data usually assume that
data from the route monitoring systems is reasonably representative
of the global Internet. However, no existing work has studied the
limitations of route monitoring systems and the visibility constraint
of different deployment scenarios. For example, recent work using
these data to detect malicious routing activities, such as address
hijacking [12, 13, 14, 15] could potentially suffer from evasion
attacks similar to those affecting trafﬁc monitoring systems [16].
The accuracy of such anomaly detection schemes depend heavily
on the coverage of the route monitoring system. The limitation of
the route monitor system is critical for any system relying on BGP
data from multiple vantage points.
It is usually impossible to obtain routing data in real time from
every network due to the scalability issue and privacy concern. Ob-
taining one feed from one AS often provides a restricted view given
there are many routers in an AS, each with a potentially different
view of routing dynamics. Additional BGP feeds are useful for
detecting routing anomalies, trafﬁc engineering, topology discov-
ery and other applications. But adding an additional feed usually
requires interacting with a particular ISP to set up the monitoring
session. Therefore, an urgent question is to understand the gen-
erality and representativeness of the given monitor system, and to
understand how to select monitor locations to maximize the overall
effectiveness of the route monitoring system.
Some existing work [17, 18, 19] studied the limitation of existing
monitor placement and monitor placement algorithms [20] in terms
of topology discovery. In this work, we study the impact of mon-
itor network location constraints on various research work in the
Internet routing community. We are the ﬁrst to examine the visibil-
ity constraints imposed by the deployment of route monitors, im-
pacting a diverse set of applications. To understand the difference
among current deployment settings, we analyze three deployment
scenarios: all Tier-1 ISPs only, Route Views and RIPE setup, and a
setup combining many public and private vantage points. We fur-
ther study four simple schemes of network monitor selection and
the resulting impact on multiple metrics based on the applications
using the data. Our analysis shows that current public monitors
already provide good coverage in various applications we study.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the
methodology of our study, followed by a short discussion compar-
ing three deployment scenarios in Section 3. We study in detail
several different monitor selection schemes in Section 4 and con-
clude in Section 5.
2. METHODOLOGY
In this section, we describe our methodology, including the data
and various metrics for comparing monitor selection schemes mo-
tivated by several common but important applications.
2.1 Route monitor locations
The BGP data we used in our study are collected from around
1000 monitoring feeds,
including public data sources such as
Route Views [1] and RIPE [2], feeds from the local ISP, and data
from private peering sessions with many other networks, covering
more than 200 distinct ASes, which are not in the public feeds. In
the remainder of the paper, we use the term monitoring feed to refer
to a BGP data source from a particular router. We deﬁne a vantage
point to be a distinct AS from which we collect BGP data from.
Note that feeds from different routers in the same AS may provide
different information, and we leave the study of the difference be-
tween feeds in the same AS for future work. We use one monitoring
feed from one vantage point. For ease of comparison across van-
tage points, we only choose feeds with default-free routing tables
(with entries for all preﬁxes), and create a data set called LargeSet
consisting of data from 156 ASes for our subsequent analysis.
The BGP updates are collected from a set of route monitors, each
of which establishes peering session with one router in each net-
work being monitored. Note that our study is inherently limited
by the BGP data we have access to and we attempt to draw gen-
eral conclusions independent of the data limitation. Although the
BGP data from all available monitors is still not the ground truth
for the whole network, we study different applications using data
from different sampling strategies and compare with this LargeSet.
Developing more intelligent monitor placement algorithms is part
of future work.
To understand static network properties, instead of using a sin-
gle table snapshot from each feed, we combine multiple snapshots
taken at different times with routing updates from each feed when-
ever available. This helps improve the topology completeness as
many backup links are only observable during transient routing
changes. We use two snapshots of tables from each monitoring
feed including feeds from about 100 ASes, along with six months
of updates and tables from Route Views, RIPE and a local ISP from
May 2006 to Oct. 2006. The resulting network topology contains
25,876 nodes(ASes) and 71,941 links. We list the properties of
current peers that Route Views and RIPE have in Table 2.
To compare different deployment strategies, we construct three
sets of realistic deployment scenarios. First, to understand the visi-
bility of the core of the Internet, we select only 9 well-known Tier-1
ISPs to be monitors, including AS numbers: 1239, 174, 209, 2914,
3356, 3549, 3561, 701, and 7018. Second, we use only feeds from
commonly used Route Views and RIPE. Third, we use LargeSet
to obtain the most complete topology from all available data. We
denote the three deployment scenarios as Tier-1, Route Views, and
LargeSet, respectively.
We focus on three types of applications relying on BGP data,
namely (1) discovery of relatively stable Internet properties such as
the AS topology and preﬁx to origin AS mappings, (2) discovery
of dynamic routing behavior such as IP preﬁx hijack attacks and
routing instability, and (3) inference of important network proper-
ties such as AS relationships and AS-level paths. Note that the ﬁrst
two applications simply extract properties directly from the routing
data. The performance of the third one depends not only on the
data but also the algorithm used for inference. We describe these
applications in more detail below.
2.2 Discovery of static network properties
BGP data is an important information source for understanding
the Internet topology. Very basic network properties are critical
for understanding the Internet routing system. These properties
include AS connectivity, IP preﬁx to origin AS mappings, iden-
tifying stub AS information and its provider’s information, multi-
homed ASes, and AS path information. Intuitively, including van-
tage points from the core is more beneﬁcial as a larger number
of network paths traverse the core networks. Previous work [21,
22, 3] has shown the inﬂuence of data sources besides BGP table
data, e.g., traceroute data and routing registries, on the complete-
ness of inferred AS topology. We extend this analysis to two other
properties: (1) multihomed stub ASes to understand edge network
resilience and potentially increased churn in updates, and (2) AS
paths, which are difﬁcult to infer.
2.3 Discovery of dynamic network properties
Dynamic properties of the routing system are of strong inter-
est for studying routing instabilities, e.g., due to misconﬁgurations,
and detecting anomalies. Understanding such properties is useful
for troubleshooting and identifying possible mitigation to improve
routing performance. We focus on two representative applications
here: monitoring routing instability and IP preﬁx hijack attack de-
tection.
Routing instability monitoring: Routing updates are a result
of routing decision changes in some networks caused by events
such as conﬁguration modiﬁcations, network failures, and dynamic
trafﬁc engineering. Comprehensively capturing Internet routing
changes is useful for important applications like troubleshooting,
routing health monitoring, and improved path selection.
IP preﬁx hijacking detection: One of the original goals of the
public route monitoring systems in Route Views and RIPE is trou-
bleshooting. Nowadays they are increasingly used for the timely
detection of malicious routing activities such as preﬁx hijacking at-
tacks. Current hijack detection systems in control plane [13, 12]
rely on detecting inconsistency in observed BGP updates across
vantage points. However, the detection system may not detect all
attacks due to limited visibility. In this work, we study the impact
of different monitoring deployment setups on the detection cover-
age.
Intuitively, an attack is missed if no vantage point of the monitor-
ing system adopts the malicious route. Thus, we deﬁne attack eva-
sion as follows. For a monitoring system SM = m1, m2, . . . , mn
with n monitors, given an attacker A, a victim V , and the hijacked
preﬁx p, if ∀i, P ref A
(p) is
the route preference value for p announced from A as observed by
mi, then attacker A can hijack V ’s p without being detected.

2.4 Inference of network properties
The third class of application studied relates to properties in-
ferred from the above basic properties from BGP data.
AS relationship inference: There is much work [6, 7, 4, 8, 5]
on inferring AS relationships from BGP AS paths. Knowing com-
mercial relationships among ASes reveals network structure and
is important for inferring AS paths.
In this work, we study the
commonly-used, Gao’s degree-based relationship inference algo-
rithm [8].
AS-level path prediction: Accurately predicting AS paths is im-
portant for applications such as network provisioning. In this work,
we compare two path prediction algorithms under various monitor
deployment settings. We use the recent algorithm [9] which makes
use of the inferred AS relationships, and study both proﬁt-driven
and shortest-path-based route selection. For the proﬁt-driven pol-
icy, the route selection prefers customer routes to peering routes
and over to provider routes. Note that predicted paths for both ap-
proaches need to conform to relationship constraints [8]. We also
study the recent work [23] which does not use AS relationships but
instead exactly matches observed paths.
To improve scalability, we eliminate stub AS nodes, or customer

ASes that do not provide any transit to other ASes. The graph with-
out stub nodes contains only 4426 (16% of all nodes) and 25849
links (15% of all links). For completeness, we also simulate the
path prediction to 50 randomly sampled stub ASes. We include
these 50 stub ASes and their links.
3. DEPLOYMENT SCENARIO ANALYSIS
We ﬁrst analyze the three deployment scenarios, Tier-1, Ruter
Views, and LargeSet deﬁned in Section 2.1. We study the impact
of these three settings on applications of AS topology discovery,
AS relationship inference, and AS-level path prediction.
Table 1 summarizes the comparison across the three setups. Con-
ﬁrming previous studies [17, 19], we ﬁnd that the largest monitor
set, LargeSet, observes much more links but only slightly more
non-private ASes. The additional ASes in the LargeSet are mostly
at the edge. Using Gao’s degree-based relationship inference algo-
rithm, we compare the accuracy of inferred paths comparing with
paths in BGP data in terms of path length. Note that the improve-
ment is small for path prediction with increasing vantage points.
Interestingly, using the largest data set lowers the length-based pre-
diction accuracy. These results imply that Gao’s algorithm is rea-
sonably stable with changes in the BGP data.
We list the network properties of current peers of both Route
Views and LargeSet in Table 2. We use the tier deﬁnition speciﬁed
in previous work [7]: Tier-1 means closest to the core Internet and
Tier-5 is associated with stub or pure customer ASes. We also ana-
lyze each AS in the aspects of geographic location, the number of
IP addresses it announces, its degree and its customers. The addi-
tional ASes in LargeSet are mainly Tier-2 ASes in US, with large
number of addresses and degree.
To understand which links are identiﬁed using a larger data set,
we plot in Figure 1 the topological location of links in each data set.
The X-axis indicates the link level, deﬁned by the tier value of the
two ASes associated with the link sorted in increasing order. For
example, there are 10 links observed from LargeSet between nodes
in tier-1 and tier-4 at the X value of 14. The hierarchy level for each
node is assigned according to the relationship inferred using all the
data available. As expected, the additional beneﬁt of observed links
are mostly at the edge.

4. MONITOR SELECTION ANALYSIS
In the previous section, we have observed some differences and
similarities among the three realistic deployment settings. To delve
deeper, we apply four simple schemes to identify the incremental
beneﬁt and even possible negative effects of adding monitors for a
wider set of applications.
4.1 Monitor selection schemes
Our candidate set of monitors consists of all BGP feeds we have
access to. We study the following four ways of adding monitors.
Random based: monitor nodes are selected randomly.
Degree based: monitors with the largest node degree are selected
ﬁrst based on the entire data set. Node degree means the number of
neighbors each AS has.
Greedy link based: at any time, the next monitor is selected with
the largest number of unobserved links, given the set of already
selected monitors.
Address block based: without relying on all the data, monitors
in the ASes that originate the largest number of IP addresses are
selected with random tie breaking.
4.2 Discovery of static network properties
To fully understand how each scheme works, we study the topo-
logical distribution of the monitors selected based on the tier clas-
siﬁcation, with the ﬁrst three tiers shown in Figure 2. We observe
that as expected the address-block-based scheme always selects the
Tier-1 nodes ﬁrst as they usually announce largest number of ad-
dresses. For Tier 2 and Tier 3, there is little difference among the
schemes.
We ﬁrst show that the observed link count increases with vantage
point in Figure 3. Conﬁrming previous studies [20], the increase of
links from 80 vantage points can be twice as the links observed
from one. The greedy-based scheme performs best as expected,
followed by the the degree-based one.
Interestingly, the address
block based scheme is no better than random selection. This is
likely due to the fact that most ASes in our candidate set contribute
a similar number of links.
