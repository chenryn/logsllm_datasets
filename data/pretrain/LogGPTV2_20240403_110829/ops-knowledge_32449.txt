User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to remote monitor a computer network traffic? I would like to know if it is possible to remote monitor the incoming and outcoming network traffic of a specific IP from my network. I need to log the time, ip numbers and port that contact the computer as well the answers. 

I cannot change any configuration/install of the machine. (so cannot install wireshark or a lower level app like tcpdump)  

best regards,

Assistant: I'm assuming that what you're doing is related to ethical pen. testing. If you have no legitimate control over your target, you have 3 options


Haxoring your target: Attempt to gain access to the target machine by exploiting some vulnerabilities in the machine itself, or the operator of the machine.
Big Man in the Middle (Between your target and the servers to which he's connecting): Attempt to gain access to the network device used by your target. For example, find some vulnerabilities or default passwords in the routers or gateways your target uses.
Man in the Middle (Between your target and his local network gateway): Attempt to trick your target into sending his traffic through you. By far, the easiest way to achieve this is through ARP Spoofing. An easy-to-use tool is Cain and Abel.
