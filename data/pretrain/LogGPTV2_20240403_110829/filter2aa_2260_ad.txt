Evaluating the level of maturity across SOPs required attention to two topics: 1) communications 
policies, practices, and procedures, and 2) command and control.   
SOP 
Finding 
1—
The TICP provided 
the first regionwide 
equipment SOP for 
many 
areas:  
Through 
the 
development of the 
DHS-required TICP, 
virtually 
every 
urban/metropolitan 
area has instituted a 
consensus, regional 
process 
for 
the 
request, 
activation, 
and 
use 
of 
interoperable 
communications 
equipment.  The most common multi-agency equipment SOPs before the TICP were primarily 
intended for the users of shared systems.  A number of areas also cited gateway SOPs, which 
were developed under previous federal efforts such as the Department of Justice “25 Cities” 
project.  Overall, relatively few state and federal responder agencies are covered by the areas’ 
SOPs, indicating that more should be done to ensure that these groups are participating in the 
development and implementation of procedures. 
SOP Finding 2—The majority of areas have taken steps 
to disseminate their equipment SOPs throughout the 
region:  Regional communications equipment SOPs 
developed by the urban/metropolitan areas are being 
disseminated in a number of ways, including distribution to 
dispatch centers, storing applicable SOPs with gateways 
and radio caches, and developing training courses on SOPs 
for agencies included in the area.  Preparation for the TICP 
validation exercise appeared to have been the major stimulus for SOP training, with more than half 
the urban/metropolitan areas participating in ICTAP “Tactical Plan Implementation Workshops” in 
the weeks leading to their exercises.  However, in most areas, the short period of time between the 
completion of the TICP and the exercise deadline made it difficult to have fully circulated, new 
SOPs at the “line” responder level.  As a result, only one third of the areas were fully successful in 
following their prescribed equipment SOPs.

Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards 
SOP 
Finding 
3—Ninety-seven 
percent 
of 
urban/metropolitan 
areas report that they are in the 
process of implementing NIMS; 
however less than half of these 
agencies have had these command 
and control policies instituted for 
more than 1 year:  Two out of three 
urban/metropolitan 
areas 
were 
determined 
to 
have 
achieved 
“Intermediate” 
maturity 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
NIMS/ICS 
command and control procedures.  
This was based not only on the length 
of time that these SOPs had been in place in the region, but also the demonstrated level of 
proficiency in the TICP validation exercise.  Exercise findings indicate that maturity in the use of 
NIMS varies by responder discipline, with fire agencies showing more aptitude in the use of these 
response procedures.   
SOP Finding 4—A NIMS Certified Communications Unit Leader Course is needed to improve 
proficiency in fulfilling the responsibilities of the communications unit during incident 
response:  As evaluated in the TICP validation exercise, areas were encouraged to implement the 
Communications Unit Leader (COML) position in their incident response.  However, although DHS 
provided core competencies on the position and ICTAP developed an overview course on COML 
duties, formal training, and a certification program are not yet available.  As a result, only 16 
percent of the areas were able to implement the COML position without difficulties during the 
exercises.  Of those areas that were successful, all but one were designated as urban areas, which 
could indicate the possibility that dedicated UASI funds were used to allow personnel to participate 
in the National Wildland Fire’s discipline-specific training course for COML (the only course of its 
kind that is currently available to first responders).

Usage was measured by examining the familiarity with and frequency that interoperable 
communications equipment was used during the TICP validation exercise.  
Usage Finding 1—
Sixty-eight 
percent 
of 
the 
urban/metropolitan 
areas 
effectively 
established regional 
interoperability:  
While 
every 
urban/metropolitan 
area evaluated was 
able to use some 
level of multi-agency 
interoperability as part 
of 
an 
incident 
response, 
multijurisdictional 
communications 
necessary to support a tactical response was successfully demonstrated by more than 60 percent 
of the urban/metropolitan areas.  Of these areas, one-half (21 percent overall) demonstrated the 
seamless use of all types of interoperability equipment (e.g., cache radios, gateways, shared 
channels and shared systems) to provide communications for not only regional responders, but 
also state and federal personnel. Frequently, the remaining successful areas encountered 
problems with at least one type of equipment, but were still able to achieve interoperability through 
the use of backup measures or the rapid resolution of the problem.  And in other cases, areas were 
able to show success, but the limited scope of the TICP validation exercise prevented 
demonstration of seamless interoperable communications capabilities. 
Usage Finding 2—More than 80 percent of urban/metropolitan areas use shared systems 
and/or shared channels daily to provide communications interoperability:  Multi-agency 
interoperability occurs on a daily basis using talk groups on trunked systems and/or conventional 
shared channels in most urban/metropolitan areas.  This method of interoperability was 
successfully used in almost every TICP validation exercise.  However, within a single 
urban/metropolitan area, the total number of shared systems could be more than a dozen, often 
operating across disparate frequency bands and/or comprising different proprietary components.  
Problems with radio channel configuration and nomenclature were the most common issues 
encountered with the use of this form of interoperable communications solution.     
Usage Finding 3—The most common equipment usage 
problems during the TICP validation exercises related 
to mobile gateways:  Gateway devices were the most 
common method used to connect responders operating on 
disparate systems during the TICP validation exercise.  In 
many areas, this was accomplished using a console patch 
or fixed gateway system.  However, when mobile gateways 
were deployed during the exercises, responders often

encountered problems.  Evaluators reported a lack of technical familiarity with mobile gateways in 
a number of exercises, which is consistent with the fact that frequency of gateway use (particularly 
mobile gateways) varies greatly across urban/metropolitan areas. 
Usage Finding 4—Urban/metropolitan areas can build on the success of their TICP 
validation exercise by expanding future training scenarios to focus on communications 
capabilities:  For the majority of urban/metropolitan areas, the required TICP validation exercise 
was the first time that the area had participated in a test designed specifically for communications.  
This fact, coupled with the aggressive timeline, led some urban/metropolitan areas to minimize the 
scope of their exercises.  While the exercises that resulted were sufficient to demonstrate 
communications interoperability, most were not large enough to test critical aspects of a real-world 
response (e.g., system loading).

DHS will continue to align its programs and resources to best address the communications needs 
of first responders.  Accomplishing this feat will require a coordinated DHS effort to provide 
increased resources and assistance to states and localities to empower greater communications 
interoperability across broader regions.  Focus on five priority efforts will support this goal: 
• 
FY 2007 Grant Programs:  The FY 2007 Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) and 
Infrastructure Protection Program will both encourage interoperable communications as a 
program focus area.    
• 
Completed Communications Unit Leader (COML) Training: DHS will complete and 
release the criteria for COML training to ensure that public safety agencies have clearer 
guidance on the COML role in incident response. 
• 
Improvement Plans/Scorecard Recommendations:  DHS ICTAP is developing, and will 
deliver during FY 2007, technical assistance to address the most prevalent gaps identified 
through the Tactical Interoperable Communications exercises.   
• 
Best Practices/Lessons Learned:  A compendium of all best practices and lessons 
learned from the TICP validation exercises will be provided to each urban/metropolitan
