User: a) I have a code that works fine if I choose Python 2.5 but it gives me errors when using python 2.7. I have easily fixed the problem in windows by choosing python 2.5 as the default program. But, it seems that cmd does not follow this change. How could I fix this?
b) what is the difference between running a script using python.exe vs. pythonw.exe? I read somewhere that upon using pythonw.exe, I will not see the cmd window that pops out and disappears. But for my case, this is not true and I actually see the cmd window. Also, if I use python.exe I get an error from running my script but not when I use pythonw.exe.
Assistant: Assumptions: You mention python(w).exe and cmd, so you're most likely on windows.

You probably selected "use python 2.n" somewhere in your IDE (whichever one you may use). That works fine as long as you ONLY execute your scripts from there. From any arbitrary other place on your system, windows (or any other OS) makes use of environment variables PATH, in this case. (right-click My Computer > advanced > environment variables or something). It probably contains the path to python27.exe C:/Python27, change that to C:/Python25. If multiple directories are used, first order takes precedence.
pythonw.exe is a custom executable related to early pywin32 development by Mark Hammond I believe, and yes it should supress the console window during startup.
