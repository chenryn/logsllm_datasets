## Abstract
The Internet is crucial for end-users, overlay network service providers (such as Akamai [1]), and Internet service providers (ISPs). However, the accuracy of existing statistical fault diagnosis methods is limited by the inability to uniquely determine link-level properties from end-to-end measurements. This paper introduces a novel least-biased end-to-end network diagnosis system (LEND) for inferring link-level properties, such as loss rates. We define a minimal identifiable link sequence (MILS) as the shortest link sequence whose properties can be uniquely identified from end-to-end measurements. We also present efficient algorithms to find all MILSs and infer their loss rates. LEND is applicable to any network topology, works with both directed and undirected properties, and adapts incrementally to changes in network topology and properties. Our simulations and Internet experiments demonstrate that LEND provides highly accurate estimates of MILS loss rates. Furthermore, LEND can achieve fine-grained, near real-time diagnosis for large overlay networks and can complement existing statistical inference methods, offering a smooth tradeoff between diagnosis accuracy and granularity.

## I. Introduction
"WHEN something breaks in the Internet, the Internet's very decentralized structure makes it hard to figure out what went wrong and even harder to assign responsibility."—“Looking Over the Fence at Networks: A Neighbor’s View of Networking Research,” by the Committee on Research Horizons in Networking, National Research Council, 2001.

Internet fault diagnosis is essential for end-users, overlay network service providers (e.g., Akamai [1]), and ISPs. For example, users can choose more reliable ISPs, overlay service providers can locate and fix faults, and ISPs can verify services from provider/peering ISPs and troubleshoot physical network issues. The modern Internet is heterogeneous and largely unregulated, making link-level fault diagnosis increasingly challenging. Most research focuses on end-to-end approaches due to the difficulty in collecting detailed network traffic data.

Internet tomography is a key method for fault diagnosis, where link properties or shared congestion are inferred from end-to-end measurements. These systems often assume path properties are linearly related to link quantities. However, as noted in [7], [8], this approach is underconstrained, leading to unidentifiable links. Existing tomography systems make assumptions to infer link properties, which can introduce systematic errors. We call these modeling errors "bias."

In this paper, we propose an unbiased diagnosis paradigm. The two fundamental assumptions for any end-to-end network diagnosis are:
1. End-to-end path properties can be accurately measured.
2. Path properties are a known linear function of the properties of the links on the path.

While these assumptions may introduce some bias, they represent the minimum bias for any end-to-end diagnosis. We define a minimal identifiable link sequence (MILS) as the shortest link sequence whose properties can be uniquely identified from end-to-end measurements without additional bias. We then propose the least-biased end-to-end network diagnosis (LEND) system, which uses linear algebra to find MILSs and infer their properties, achieving the finest possible diagnosis granularity without additional assumptions.

When combined with statistical inference, our approach offers a full spectrum of network diagnosis methods, balancing diagnosis accuracy and granularity. LEND cannot infer properties for each link due to the unidentifiable link problem, but stronger statistical assumptions can reduce granularity at the cost of introducing more bias and sacrificing accuracy.

An interesting challenge in designing LEND is the different behavior of inference methods on directed versus undirected graphs. For symmetric link properties, the network can be modeled as an undirected graph, and we can use routing information to find MILSs. However, the real Internet has asymmetric link properties and must be modeled as a directed graph, making the identification of MILSs more complex.

Our contributions include:
- Advocating the unbiased end-to-end diagnosis paradigm and introducing the concept of MILS.
- Proving that, in a directed graph, each path is a MILS when only topology information is used.
- Proposing a "good path" algorithm to find MILSs with the finest granularity using both topology and measurement snapshots.
- Designing efficient algorithms to update MILSs and their loss rate estimates incrementally.
- Showing that LEND complements other tomography techniques by reducing complexity and improving inference accuracy.

We evaluate LEND through extensive simulations and Internet experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

## II. Related Work
Ping and traceroute are early and widely used Internet diagnosis tools, but they struggle with inferring individual link properties due to Internet routing and link property asymmetry. Recent work on network diagnosis can be categorized into pure end-to-end approaches and router-response-based approaches.

### A. Pure End-to-End Approach
Most end-to-end tomography tools fall into two classes:
1. Tools based on temporal correlations among multiple receivers in a multicast-like environment [2]–[4], [10], [11].
2. Tools imposing additional statistical assumptions beyond the linear loss model [5], [7].

None of these tools provide unbiased diagnosis. For example, the statistically based tool in [5] and [7] uses uncorrelated end-to-end measurements to identify lossy links but can produce biased results. In a simple tree topology, these tools may predict incorrect loss rates. LEND, however, determines that none of the individual links are identifiable and identifies MILSs.

### B. Router-Response-Based Approach
Router-based approaches rely on response packets from interior routers. However, these routers may not respond or may provide insufficient information. For example, ICMP-based tools [12], [13] cannot measure the loss rate on each link due to ICMP filtering or rate limiting. Tulip [12], a recent router-based approach, underestimates overall loss rates and is sensitive to simultaneous measurement probes.

## III. Models and Architecture
In this section, we describe the algebraic model and system architecture of LEND. The algebraic model is widely used in Internet tomography and other measurement works [3], [8], [14]. However, LEND requires significant additional design, such as the introduction of MILSs.

### A. Algebraic Model
We briefly introduce the algebraic model used in network diagnosis. For easy indexing, important notations are listed in Table I. Suppose an overlay network spans IP links. A path is represented by a vector, and the path properties are a known linear function of the link properties.
