User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows that the CBS and CSI software components were initialized, and that there were multiple warnings about unrecognized packageExtended attributes. The HRESULT code for each warning was 0x800f080d, which indicates CBS_E_MANIFEST_INVALID_ITEM.
