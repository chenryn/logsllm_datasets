A final noteworthy finding is that confidence in user decision was generally high and was
not affected by the Profile condition. This suggests that the TRI is not a factor that impacts
how confident users are in their SE rental decisions.

Digital Identity and user judgment
Study 2
Study 2 was devised to unpack the effects relating to the act of selection and the amount of
information on user judgement, as the data indicated that users relying on three selected ele-
ments rated hosts similarly to participants which had access to all seven elements.
People often report using complex strategies and a large number of cues when making their
judgements; however, empirical studies show that they fail to accurately use more than two or
three cues at any one time, and incorrectly predict which ones play a role in their decision-
making process [41,43,44,50,52]. Thus, the lack of difference due to the amount of information
may be explained either by the fact that (1) users considered the elements they selected as
being more informative towards their final decision, leading to equally positive judgements, or
(2) users seeing more than three elements could not incorporate these into their decision-mak-
ing (i.e. discounting information), thus producing no differences in judgement.
A modification of Study 1’s design was implemented. Using the results from the Reveal
condition, we selected element triplets to present to users directly and compared their
responses to users that selected three elements. This ensured that the amount of information
was kept constant (i.e. three pieces of TRI per profile), and that any difference in renting deci-
sion or perceptions of hosts would be a result of the act of selecting information.
Methods
Participants and design. 120 participants were recruited through mTurk, in exchange for
$1.00. After deleting incomplete cases (n = 3), 117 participants remained.
Eiteee asd (65 males, 52 females; MAge = 36.21, SD = 10.35; range: 20–69). The design was
similar to that of Study 1, with Profile having two conditions: 3-Seen, 3-Reveal. Participants
were measured on the same DVs as Study 1.
Stimuli. The profiles in the 3-Seen condition contained only three TRI elements to assist
in user decision-making, selected based on the data from the previous study. In this condition
each profile contained one of the three triplet combinations whose selection frequency was
found to be significant in Study 1: “stars + guest reviews + number of reviews”, “stars + guest
reviews + host verification”, or “stars + guest reviews + host reviews”. In the 3-Reveal condi-
tion, the same profile generation procedure as in Study 1’s Reveal condition was employed.
This allowed for a direct comparison of the effect of choice on user judgement, as information
was kept constant in all conditions.
Procedure. The procedure was identical to that of Study 1, but here participants were ran-
domly assigned to one of the two Profile conditions: 3-Seen (n = 61) or 3-Reveal (n = 56).
Within the 3-Seen condition, participants were further randomly divided into the three sub-
conditions, based on the triplet they saw. Thus, each participant in the 3-Seen sub-condition
saw a specific triplet throughout his/her trials (randomized between participants with a rate of
1/3). In all conditions participants saw 10 profiles and responded to questions regarding each
profile using the same scales as Study 1. A control was also placed on the experiment which
prevented participants from double-checking profiles after seeing the validation questions.
Results
Multiple independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare the responses in the 3-Seen
and 3-Reveal conditions for each DV. The data revealed no significant differences in any of the
responses users gave based on Profile condition, on any of the measured variables, ts  1, ps >
.05. This supports the explanation that users do not rely on more than three pieces of informa-
tion judging a host’s profile (for additional analyses, see S5 Text).

Digital Identity and user judgment
To provide more support, Bayesian independent-samples t-tests were conducted on the
data, which did favor this conclusion. Moderate to substantial support in favor of accepting
the null of no difference between the 3-Seen and 3-Reveal conditions was found, BF01 between
2.29 and 3.77 for all DVs (S5 Text).
Discussion
The data suggests that users are not affected by the act of selecting which TRI they want to see
before making a rental decision beyond simply being presented three pieces of information.
On all measured variables, users provided similar responses in the 3-Seen and 3-Reveal condi-
tions. This suggests that users’ judgements are influenced by seeing at least three elements of
TRI, but are unaffected by either the act of selecting said information or seeing more than
three (S5 Text).
Study 3
People find uncertainty unpleasant and seek to reduce it [53]. Relying on information pro-
vided by others may assist with this issue, allowing users to reduce the number of alternatives
and task complexity [54]. However, the results from the above studies raise questions about
the actual usefulness to users of the information available on SE platforms.
Is the information in the elements presented to users impacting decisions, or do users sim-
ply need three elements to believe they are making an “informed” decision? To understand
this, the third study assessed whether specific triplets result in differences in users’ judgements
about hosts’ credibility, sociability, trustworthiness, and decision to rent a room. Here, users
saw one of three options. From Study 1’s Reveal condition, specific triplets were chosen to
reflect the least selected triplet combinations (3-Avoided), the three most selected triplet com-
binations (3-Wanted), and triplets containing a random combination of the remaining ele-
ments (3-Random).
A significant difference in users’ judgements between conditions would support the claim
that users have a preference for what information they use when making their rental decisions,
which in turn affect their ratings of hosts. Alternatively, a lack of a difference would suggest
that users simply require the presence of three elements for the positivity effect to occur.
Methods
Participants and design. 189 participants (103 males, 86 females; MAge = 34.09,
SD = 10.23; range: 19–48) were recruited through mTurk, in exchange for $1.00. The design
was similar to the previous studies, with Profile having three conditions: 3-Wanted, 3-Avoided,
3-Random. Participants were measured on the same DVs as the previous studies.
Stimuli.
In the 3-Wanted condition, profiles were generated using the same three triplet
combinations as in Study 2’s 3-Seen condition. In the 3-Avoided condition, profiles were com-
prised of three triplet combinations chosen so as to be the least selected combinations by users
in Study 1’s Reveal condition (see S4 Text). In these sub-conditions, “host verification” and
“host reviews” were always shown together, while the third element was either “social media
presence”, “online market reputation”, or “number of reviews”. In the 3-Random condition,
profiles were comprised of randomly selected triplet combinations formed from the remaining
unused combinations.
Procedure. Participants were randomly allocated to one of the three Profile conditions:
3-Wanted (n = 67), 3-Avoided (n = 67), 3-Random (n = 55). For the 3-Wanted and 3-Avoided
conditions, participants were further divided into their respective three sub-conditions.

Digital Identity and user judgment
Participants saw 10 host profiles in each condition containing a consistent triplet of informa-
tion throughout. They responded to each profile using the same scales as in the previous
studies.
Results
Multiple one-way ANOVAs were conducted to uncover any differences in users’ judgments
based on Profile condition. The data did not reveal any statistically significant effects of Profile
on any of the measured variables, Fs  .44 (for additional analyses, see S6 Text).
To provide additional support for the findings of no differences in user judgments based on
specific elements, the frequentist analyses were complemented with a Bayesian approach. Test-
ing the assumption of no difference from the null hypothesis, the Bayesian ANOVA conducted
on rent decisions between the three Profile conditions revealed a Bayes factor of BF01 = 9.05,
indicating that the data was around 9 times more likely under the null than the alternative
hypothesis. For confidence, a BF01 = 13.35 was found in favor of the null. With regards to host
ratings, for sociability a BF01 = 14.36 was found, for trustworthiness a BF01 = 14.01 was found,
and for credibility a BF01 = 12.15 was found.
Discussion
The data consistently shows that the information contained in the individual TRI elements
does not influence judgment beyond their simple presence. No differences in user judgements
were found when comparing triplets that users selected most often (3-Wanted), or the ones
they avoided selecting (3-Avoided), or simply showing three random elements (3-Random).
The findings suggest that providing users with at least three TRI elements to aid their deci-
sion-making is sufficient to produce a strong positivity in their judgements of hosts on SE
accommodation-style platforms.
General discussion
The SE’s proliferation brings opportunities for individuals, but also potential, and yet
unknown, risks. The information individuals rely on in SE platforms differs significantly from
what consumers generally rely on in traditional marketplaces. Namely, there is an overreliance
on UGC to assess the trustworthiness and reputation of other users. In this respect, the novelty
of the SE and its multiple platforms raises many questions regarding people’s judgments and
their ability to use such information to make informed decisions.
To understand the impact of trust and reputation based systems on human judgment, the
current paper investigated the role of DI information on user judgments in an artificial SE
accommodation platform. Over three studies, the data showed that users are strongly influ-
enced by the presence of TRI, resulting in an overall positivity towards hosts and increased
tendency to rent rooms. The ratings users gave to hosts on measures of sociability, credibility,
and trustworthiness increased significantly when they were provided information relating to
the hosts’ DI, compared to seeing a profile lacking such information. However, the amount or
specificity of this information did not seem to impact judgement.
The findings of Study 1 speak to the effects that P2P platforms have on people’s decision-
making process. In line with past research, TRI is found to have a significant impact on users’
decision to engage with others on P2P platforms, and to seek their services [30]. Here, we find
that even when maintaining the quality of the service or product constant (i.e. the rooms),
users perceive these in a more positive light if they are provided with TRI regarding the pro-
vider (i.e. host).

Digital Identity and user judgment
The sharp contrast in rent decisions between the Hidden and other profile conditions
would suggest that TRI is used in deciding not only our perceptions of other peers on SE plat-
forms, but also of the likelihood we will use their goods or services. Viewing the Hidden condi-
tion profiles as reflecting new users on a platform, illustrates that even profiles devoid of TRI
can have success (as seen by the overall high rent decisions). However, it is clear that profiles
containing platform- and community-generated information have a significant advantage
[31,37,40]. Interestingly, though, we found cross-platform reputation not to be a frequently
selected item in the Reveal condition, which suggests that users retain a preference for infor-
mation generated “locally” by the community of the platform of interest. Furthermore, the
lack of a statistically significant difference between the Visible and Reveal conditions implied
either that users were discounting the extra information, resulting in no added positivity
beyond that seen in the Reveal condition, or that the act of selecting which information to
reveal compensated for the information difference.
Study 2 examined these explanations. Here, the data suggested that simply seeing three ele-
ments is sufficient to generate an overall positivity towards hosts and to increase rental deci-
sions, while the act of self-selecting information has no effect on judgment.
Study 3 investigated whether specific information mattered towards this positivity; that is,
whether different elements result in a different perceptions of hosts. Overall, the data strongly
showed that specific combinations did not matter. Irrespective of the frequency with which
users tend to select them naturally, presenting three TRI elements is sufficient to positively
impact judgments and increase rent decisions.
The above findings resonate with the judgment and decision-making literature, expanding
it to online user behavior. From this literature, we know that people are cognitive misers [55],
rarely able to incorporate diverse information from multiple sources into their judgements.
People are also subject to several biases that can influence their perception and the trust they
place in others, as well as the risks they are willing to take. Rather than relying on rational and
strategic process to make decisions, people tend to rely on quick and automatic rules-of-
thumb to make their judgments [42]. Moreover, people are poor at estimating their own pref-
erences for information [43], and are limited to around three cues when making judgments
[44].
Thus, while people show a strong selection preference for specific TRI elements in SE envi-
ronments, these may not reflect specific differences in how the information is perceived or
