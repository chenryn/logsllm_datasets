When you create an instance, you choose your desired operating system, instance type, storage, networking, and security options. 2. Connect to the EC2 instance: Once the EC2 instance has been created, you can use the EC2 instance connection tool or SSH client provided by Amazon to connect to the EC2 instance. 3. Configure the EC2 instance: After connecting to the EC2 instance, you can configure properties such as the network and security groups of the instance, and you can also install and configure software. 4. Monitor EC2 instances: Use AWS tools such as Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance and health of EC2 instances. 5. Manage EC2 instances: You can use the AWS console, AWS CLI or API to manage EC2 instances. This includes operations such as starting, stopping, restarting, deleting instances, and more. 6. Automated EC2 instances: AWS provides a variety of automation tools, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, etc., which can automatically create, configure, and manage EC2 instances.
