Question: In a newly developed web application, the engineering team has identified several input handling issues during the code review process. Which of the following scenarios are likely instances of improper handling of structural elements within the application?
"A": "The application's parser fails to validate the nesting and syntax of JSON payloads, leading to erratic behavior when malformed JSON is received.",
"B": "User input for file paths is directly concatenated with system directories without sanitization, potentially leading to directory traversal attacks.",
"C": "When processing XML data, the application does not check for the presence of external entity references, which could lead to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack.",
"D": "The application does not properly escape user-supplied SQL queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks."
