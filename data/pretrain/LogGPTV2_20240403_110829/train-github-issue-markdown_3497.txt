To have pull-right and pull-left for Bootstrap v3 in xs, sm, md, lg media.
This will help having some complex behavior for contents.
I'm working on number of projects which needs some Complex behavior on content
. as you can see in the Modal Window at this site http://stream.aljazeera.com
.. which is messing the pull-right and pull-left for media devices.
You will notice that content will change for mobiles, Tablets.
Now we are into the new Bootstrap v3 !!!!!
As for Bootstrap v3 we still see that we do not have this list Of classes.
pull-left-xs  
pull-right-xs
pull-left-sm  
pull-right-sm
pull-left-md  
pull-right-md
pull-left-lg  
pull-right-lg
As we do have to add them every time.  
I have this Repo for that at this link https://github.com/Natshah/bootstrap-
pull
I hope that you consider adding add the 8 new classes.
Thanks :)
