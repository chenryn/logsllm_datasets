Subject: Request to Add pull-left and pull-right Classes for Different Media Queries in Bootstrap v3

Dear Bootstrap Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request the addition of specific pull-left and pull-right classes for different media queries (xs, sm, md, lg) in Bootstrap v3. These classes would greatly enhance the flexibility and control over content layout, especially in complex scenarios.

Currently, I am working on several projects that require intricate content behavior. One such example is the modal window on the site http://stream.aljazeera.com. In this case, the current pull-left and pull-right classes do not provide the necessary responsiveness across different devices, leading to suboptimal content display on mobiles and tablets.

To address this, I propose adding the following classes to Bootstrap v3:

- `pull-left-xs`
- `pull-right-xs`
- `pull-left-sm`
- `pull-right-sm`
- `pull-left-md`
- `pull-right-md`
- `pull-left-lg`
- `pull-right-lg`

These classes would allow developers to apply pull-left and pull-right styles more precisely based on the device's screen size, thereby improving the overall user experience.

I have already created a repository with these proposed changes, which you can find at the following link: [https://github.com/Natshah/bootstrap-pull](https://github.com/Natshah/bootstrap-pull).

I hope you will consider integrating these 8 new classes into the official Bootstrap v3 release.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
