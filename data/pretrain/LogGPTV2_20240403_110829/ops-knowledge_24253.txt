User: I would like to convert grapheme to phoneme. And I want to pip install pocketsphinx to do that. One of its dependency is swig, so I downloaded and placed it in a directory and go to the environment path variable and add the path that leads to swig.exe. When I cmd and type 'swig --help' it seems to be working.
But when I go 'pip install pocketsphinx, it says 'error: command 'swig.exe failed: No such file or directory'.
Assistant: You can use pipwin to install it without any issues.

Install pipwin [Run as Administrator, if any issues]


pip install pipwin


Install pocketsphinx using pipwin


pipwin install pocketsphinx

Note: Works on Windows-10(win32-py3.8) [Tested]
