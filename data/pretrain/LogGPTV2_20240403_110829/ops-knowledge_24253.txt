To convert graphemes to phonemes, you would like to install the `pocketsphinx` package. One of its dependencies is `swig`, and you have already downloaded and placed `swig` in a directory, then added the path to `swig.exe` in your environment variables. When you run `swig --help` in the command prompt, it appears to be working. However, when you attempt to install `pocketsphinx` using `pip`, you encounter an error: "command 'swig.exe' failed: No such file or directory."

To resolve this issue, you can use `pipwin` to install `pocketsphinx` without encountering the same problem. Follow these steps:

1. **Install `pipwin`**:
   - Open a command prompt with administrative privileges (Run as Administrator if you encounter any issues).
   - Run the following command:
     ```sh
     pip install pipwin
     ```

2. **Install `pocketsphinx` using `pipwin`**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```sh
     pipwin install pocketsphinx
     ```

**Note**: This method has been tested and works on Windows 10 (win32-py3.8).

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install `pocketsphinx` and proceed with your grapheme-to-phoneme conversion.
