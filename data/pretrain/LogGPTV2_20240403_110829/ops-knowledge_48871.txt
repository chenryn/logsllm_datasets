Question: In a review of an organization's web server infrastructure, you find that the authentication systems are configured with complex password requirements and support multi-factor authentication. However, you also discover that they permit unlimited login attempts without any account lockout policy. Which of the following statements is a valid reason why this configuration does not adequately secure the authentication systems?
"A": "Complex passwords and multi-factor authentication increase the time needed for user authentication, leading to a higher chance of denial-of-service attacks.",
"B": "Unlimited login attempts without an account lockout policy could allow a brute force attack, undermining the effectiveness of complex passwords and multi-factor authentication.",
"C": "Multi-factor authentication is incompatible with web applications that require high availability.",
"D": "Complex password requirements might cause users to write down passwords, which is a less significant risk than brute force attacks."
Answer: B
