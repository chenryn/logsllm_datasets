### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
Environment variables are resolved by npx instead of being left intact to be
dealt with by the invoked node executable.
    > npx --version
    8.1.3
    > npx argv-to-list $HOME '$HOME' 'price = $100' 
    /Users/soft # regular shell environment variable resolution 
    /Users/soft # why does npx resolve environment variables?
    price = 00  # *ugh* this is bad...
### Expected Behavior
    > npx argv-to-list $HOME '$HOME' 'price = $100' 
    /Users/soft
    $HOME
    price = $100
