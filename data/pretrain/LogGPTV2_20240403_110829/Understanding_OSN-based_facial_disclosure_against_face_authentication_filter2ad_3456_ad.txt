5.3 Implications of Our Findings
Face authentication does provide an attractive alternative of user
authentication for its non-intrusive and zero-memory procedure.
However, the appearance of OSNFD brings a signiﬁcant threat to
question the practicality of face authentication as a usable authen-
tication factor. Nowadays, a huge amount of personal facial im-
ages/videos have been published in OSNs that can be accessible to
potential adversaries without the previously required physical prox-
imity. Therefore, face biometrics can now be disclosed in large
scale and acquired by adversaries remotely. Face biometrics are no
longer secrets only owned by the users and can be disclosed to any-
one who has access to victim’s personal images shared in OSNs.
Raising the security level of face authentication systems could
mitigate the OSNFD threat by scarifying the accessibility, which
leads to the inconvenience for legitimate users. Liveness detec-
tion is another major countermeasure to mitigate the spooﬁng at-
tack against the face authentication systems. Unfortunately, exist-
ing liveness detection techniques available on consumer-level com-
puting devices can be easily circumvented by one or two images.
More reliable liveness detection like multi-modal mechanisms usu-
ally relies on using additional authentication factor (e.g. another
biometrics such as voice and ﬁngerprint). This introduces another
liveness detection problem for the additional authentication factor,
which may not be reliable. For example, voice and ﬁngerprint can
also be spoofed. Even worse, more serious privacy concerns will
rise if a system requires to collect many biometrics information
from a user [42], which may eventually cause the rejection of the
liveness detection mechanism.
As the emergence of OSNFD, the face biometrics is losing con-
ﬁdentiality which is one of the fundamental requirements for a us-
able authentication factor. Moreover, the existing liveness detection
techniques are either too weak to defend against the OSNFD or too
difﬁcult to be deployed on the consumer-level devices. All these
ﬁndings suggest that face authentication may not be a proper au-
thentication factor unless we can resolve the discovered problems.
5.4 Limitations
Ecological validity is a challenge to any user study. Like most
prior research [12, 35, 3], our study only recruits students in uni-
versity. These participants are more active in using consumer-level
computing devices and sharing images in OSNs. Thus the evalua-
tion of the OSNFD may vary with other populations.
In the user study design, it is still a challenge to collect facial im-
ages with precisely controlled head poses [27]. Like the prior head
pose data sets [13, 23, 34], the accuracy of the head poses in our
data set may be affected by the poor ability of the participant to ac-
curately direct his/her head, the unconscious movement of human
beings and limit of resources. In another experiment of examin-
ing the false rejection rates of the face authentication systems, we
choose 4 locations to mimic different login environments in daily
life. Since it is impossible for all the participants to do the tests at
the same time and at the same physical positions, the background
of image inputs captured by the camera may change.
Another challenge in our study is to accurately estimate param-
eters [21] such as head pose, illumination, and makeup in our col-
lected OSN dataset. Since the accuracy of automatic labeling tools
is limited [1, 30], we manually label the OSN images with the help
of automatic tools and follow the similar validating methodology
used in prior study [21, 17, 41]. For each OSN image, we esti-
mate the head pose with typical head pose estimation algorithms
including POSIT and LGBP [27]. And we manually validate the
estimation of the head pose by comparison between the OSN image
and the participant’s images with controlled head poses. We manu-
ally label the parameters related to lighting conditions according to
the shadow and histogram of face region similar to the approaches
in [21, 17]. The parameters related to facial expressions are label
by comparing the OSN image with the images captured in our user
study, which is similar to [21, 17]. We use popular face detection
software Picasa to mark the face region with a rectangle in the im-
age and calculate the resolution of the face region. The parameters
related to the attributes of blur, makeup, and edit are labeled in the
way similar to [21, 17, 41].
It is also possible to further improve our risk estimation tool.
To our best knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst attempt to semi-
automatically detect the vulnerable images that can be used to at-
tack face authentication. Our current risk estimation tool can serve
as a baseline for future improvement by reﬁning the key parameters
and the statistical model. It is also valuable to incorporate auto-
matic high accuracy labeling for those hard-to-label attributes like
illumination and facial makeup, once the ongoing research [27, 9,
7] resolves these challenges.
6. RELATED WORK
In this section, we summarize the closely related work in terms
of face recognition, spooﬁng attack, and liveness detection.
In face recognition, holistic approaches and local landmark
based approaches are the two major types of popular face recog-
nition algorithms [1, 43]. The holistic approaches, such as PCA-
based algorithms and LDA-based algorithms, use the whole face
region as input. Local landmark based approaches extract local fa-
cial landmarks such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc and feed locations
and local statistics of these local facial landmarks into a structure
classiﬁer.
Face authentication is an important application of face recogni-
tion, which validates a claimed identity based on comparison be-
tween a facial image and an enrolled facial image and determines
either accepting or rejecting the claimed identity [26]. Trewin et
al. [36] show that the face authentication is faster and causes lower
421interruption of user memory recall task than voice, gesture, and
typical password entry. Another advantage of face authentication
is that it provides stronger defense against repudiation than token
based authentication and password based authentication [28]. Be-
sides face authentication, face identiﬁcation is another application
of face recognition, which compare a facial image with multiple
registered users and identiﬁes the user in the facial images. The
face identiﬁcation can cause privacy leakage in OSNs due to the
identiﬁable personal images published in OSNs [3, 12]. Compared
to their work, our study focuses on investigating the impact of the
shared personal images that can be used to attack face authentica-
tion systems.
It is a well-known fact that face authentication is subject to
spooﬁng attacks. An attacker can pass the authentication by dis-
playing images or videos of a legitimate user in hard copy or on
the screen [5]. But it is generally believed sufﬁciently secure as an
authentication factor for common access protection, as an adver-
sary usually has to be physically proximate to a victim in order to
collected required face biometrics. Our ﬁndings indicate that this
belief is not valid as the emergence of OSNFD. Face biometrics can
now be disclosed in large scale and acquired by a remote adversary.
Liveness detection is the major countermeasure designed to miti-
gate the risk of spooﬁng attacks. Interaction based approach, multi-
modal based approach, and motion based approach are three pop-
ular types of liveness detection [29, 19, 4]. Interaction based ap-
proaches require real-time responses from claimants, including eye
blink, head rotation, facial expression, etc. However, these ap-
proaches can be bypassed with one or two images [31]. Multi-
modal based approaches take face biometric and other biomet-
rics into consideration together such as voice, facial thermogram,
etc [29]. The multi-modal based approaches require additional
hardware and speciﬁc environment. Motion based approaches are
based on the detection of involuntary motions of a 3D face, such
as involuntary rotation of head [19]. The approaches require high
quality images captured with ideal lighting condition. Compared to
these approaches, our estimation tool addresses this problem from
a different perspective. Since OSNFD signiﬁcantly compromise
the conﬁdentiality of face authentication, our tool is designed to in-
crease the users’ awareness before they publish their personal im-
ages so as to reduce the number of exploitable images available to
an adversary.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the threat of OSN-based facial dis-
closure (OSNFD) against some real-world face authentication sys-
tems. Our results show that the face authentication systems are
vulnerable to OSNFD-based attacks. We analyzed the characteris-
tics of these attacks from three major perspectives including secu-
rity settings, target platforms and user behavior. The key attributes
of the OSNFD were further extracted to develop a risk estimation
tool that can help users understand the risks associated with their
personal images shared in OSNs. Our work made the ﬁrst step
in systematically understanding the OSNFD. Quantitative evidence
indicates that face authentication may not be a proper authentica-
tion factor as the conﬁdentiality of face biometrics has been signif-
icantly compromised by OSNFD.
