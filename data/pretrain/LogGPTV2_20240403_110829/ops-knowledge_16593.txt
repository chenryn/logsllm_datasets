User: We need to deploy a highly available web server cluster to ensure high concurrent request processing capability and fault recovery capability. Please provide a possible solution and explain its advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Solution: 1. Use nginx and keepalived to achieve high availability load balancing, and distribute requests to multiple web servers. 2. Use MySQL master-slave replication and dual-machine hot standby (master-standby switchover) to achieve high availability of the database. At the same time, use caching tools such as Redis to reduce database pressure. 3. Use cloud services such as cloud servers and cloud load balancing to achieve high availability and elastic expansion. Advantages: 1. It can meet the requirements of high concurrent request processing capability and fault recovery capability, and improve the stability and reliability of the service. 2. Rapid horizontal expansion and dynamic scaling can be achieved through cloud services, and resource usage can be automatically adjusted according to business load. 3. Master-slave replication and dual-machine hot backup can effectively guarantee the security and reliability of data. At the same time, caching tools can improve efficiency and reduce database pressure. Disadvantages: 1. The deployment and management of this solution requires a certain level of technology, which may be difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises without professional technical personnel. 2. There may be certain cost pressures, especially when using cloud services, corresponding fees need to be paid. 3. In terms of configuration, it is necessary to focus on the security of each node to avoid security issues and hacker attacks.
