User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache2 configuration error: " was not closed" error So I've already checked through my config file and I really can't see an instance where any tag hasn't been properly closed...but I keep getting this configuration error...Would you mind taking a look through the error and the config file below? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. 

FYI, I've already googled the life out of the error and looked through the log extensively, I really can't find anything. 

Error:


  apache2: Syntax error on line 236 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: syntax error on line 1 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default:1:  was not closed.


Line 236 of apache2.conf:

UPDATE

I had a load of other issues with my install so I wound up just wiping it and reinstalling. If I run into the same problem, I'll repost.

Everyone, thanks for your help/suggestions.

Assistant: I had the same problem in my virtualHosts config and solved it by converting Windows format file to Unix format file.

All characters "\r" (CR carriage return) need to be converted in "\n" unix (LF line feed)
