ter monitored at our network. We see that more than 90%
of the attacks use TCP as their protocol of choice, but a
smaller number of ICMP-based attacks produce a dispro-
portionate number of the backscatter packets seen. Other
protocols represent a minor number of both attacks and
backscatter packets. This pattern is consistent across all
three traces.
In Table 5 we further break down our dataset based
on the service (as revealed in the victim’s port number)
being attacked. Most of the attacks focus on multiple
ports, rather than a single one and most of these are well
spread throughout the address range. Many attack pro-
grams select random ports above 1024; this may explain
why less than 25% of attacks show a completely uniform
random port distribution according to the A2 test. Of the
remaining attacks, the most popular static categories are
port 6667 (IRC), port 80 (HTTP), port 23 (Telnet), port
113 (Authd). The large number of packets directed at
port 0 is an artifact of our ICMP categorization – there
are fewer than ten TCP attacks directed at port 0, com-
prising a total of less than 9,000 packets.
6.2.3 Attack rate
Figure 4 shows two cumulative distributions of attack
event rates in packets per second. The lower curve shows
the cumulative distribution of event rates for all attacks,
and the upper curve shows the cumulative distribution
of event rates for uniform random attacks, i.e., those at-
tacks whose source IP addresses satisﬁed the A2 uni-
form distribution test described in Section 3.2. As de-
scribed earlier, we calculate the attack event rate by mul-
tiplying the average arrival rate of backscatter packets by
256 (assuming that an attack represents a random sam-
pling across the entire address space, of which we mon-
itor
the address distribution, but sometimes small deviations
from uniformity prevent the A2 test from being satisﬁed.
For this reason we believe that there is likely some va-
lidity in the extrapolation applied to the complete attack
dataset. Note that the attack rate (x-axis) is shown using
a logarithmic scale.
!" ). Almost all attacks have no dominant mode in
Comparing the distributions, we see that the uniform
random attacks have a lower rate than the distribution of
all attacks, but track closely. Half of the uniform random
attack events have a packet rate greater than 250, whereas
half of all attack events have a packet rate greater than
350. The fastest uniform random event is over 517,000
packets per second, whereas the fastest overall event is
over 679,000 packets per second.
How threatening are the attacks that we see? Recent
experiments with SYN attacks on commercial platforms
show that an attack rate of only 500 SYN packets per
second is enough to overwhelm a server [10].
In our
trace, 38% of uniform random attack events and 46% of
all attack events had an estimated rate of 500 packets per
second or higher. The same experiments show that even
with a specialized ﬁrewall designed to resist SYN ﬂoods,
a server can be disabled by a ﬂood of 14,000 packets
per second.
In our data, 0.3% of the uniform random
attacks and 2.4% of all attack events would still compro-
mise these attack-resistant ﬁrewalls. We conclude that
the majority of the attacks that we have monitored are
fast enough to overwhelm commodity solutions, and a
small fraction are fast enough to overwhelm even opti-
mized countermeasures.
Of course, one signiﬁcant factor in the question of
threat posed by an attack is the connectivity of the vic-
tim. An attack rate that overwhelms a cable modem vic-
tim may be trivial a well-connected major server installa-
tion. Victim connectivity is a difﬁcult to ascertain with-

out ﬂooding the victim’s link. Consequently, we leave
correlation between attack rates and victim connectivity
as an open problem.
6.2.4 Attack duration
While attack event rates characterize the intensity of at-
tacks, they do not give insight on how long attacks are
sustained. For this metric, we characterize the duration
of attacks in Figures 5 and 6 across all three weeks of
trace data. In these graphs, we use the ﬂow-based classi-
ﬁcation described in Section 4 because ﬂows better char-
acterize attack durations while remaining insensitive to
intensity. We also combine all three weeks of attacks
for clarity; the distributions are nearly dentical for each
week, and individual weekly curves overlap and obscure
each other.
Figure 5 shows the cumulative distribution of attack
durations in units of time; note that both the axes are log-
arithmic scale. In this graph we see that most attacks are
relatively short: 50% of attacks are less than 10 minutes
in duration, 80% are less than 30 minutes, and 90% last
less than an hour. However, the tail of the distribution
is long: 2% of attacks are greater than 5 hours, 1% are
greater than 10 hours, and dozens spanned multiple days.
Figure 6 shows the probability density of attack du-
rations as deﬁned using a histogram of 150 buckets in
the log time domain. The x-axis is in logarithmic units
of time, and the y-axis is the percentage of attacks that
lasted a given amount of time. For example, when the
curve crosses the y-axis, it indicates that approximately
0.5% of attacks had a duration of 1 minute. As we saw
in the CDF, the bulk of the attacks are relatively short,
lasting from 3–20 minutes. From this graph, though, we
see that there are peaks at rounded time durations in this
interval at durations of 5, 10, and 20 minutes. Immedi-
ately before this interval there is a peak at 3 minutes, and
immediately after a peak at 30 minutes. For attacks with
longer durations, we see a local peak at 2 hours in the
long tail.

6.3 Victim classiﬁcation
In this section we characterize victims according to DNS
name, top-level domain, Autonomous System, and de-
gree of repeated attacks.
6.3.1 Victim Name
Table 6 shows the distribution of attacks according to
the DNS name associated with the victim’s IP address.
We classify these using a hand-tuned set of regular ex-
pression matches (i.e. DNS names with “dialup” repre-
sent modems, “dsl” or “home.com” represent broadband,
etc). The majority of attacks are not classiﬁed by this
scheme, either because they are not matched by our cri-
teria (shown by “other”), or more likely, because there
was no valid reverse DNS mapping (shown by “In-Addr
Arpa”).
First,
Of the remaining attacks there are several interest-

ing observations.
tion of attacks directed against home machines – ei-
ther dialup or broadband. Some of these attacks, par-
ticularly those directed towards cable modem users,
constitute relatively large, severe attacks with rates in
the thousands of packets per second. This suggests
that minor denial-of-service attacks are frequently be-
ing used to settle personal vendettas. In the same vein
we anecdotally observe a signiﬁcant number of attacks
against victims running “Internet Relay Chat” (IRC),
victims supporting multi-player game use (e.g.
bat-
tle.net), and victims with DNS names that are sex-
ually suggestive or incorporate themes of drug use.
We further note that many reverse DNS mappings
have been clearly been compromised by attackers (e.g.,
DNS translations such as “is.on.the.net.illegal.ly” and
“the.feds.cant.secure.their.shellz.ca”).
Second, there is a small but signiﬁcant fraction of
attacks directed against network infrastructure. Be-
tween 2–3% of attacks target name servers (e.g.,
ns4.reliablehosting.com), while 1–3% target
routers
(e.g., core2-corel-oc48.paol.above.net). Again, some of
these attacks, particularly a few destined towards routers,
are comprised of a disproportionately large number of
packets. This point is particularly disturbing, since over-
whelming a router could deny service to all end hosts
that rely upon that router for connectivity.
Finally, we are surprised at the diversity of different
commercial attack targets. While we certainly ﬁnd at-
tacks on bellwether Internet sites including aol.com, aka-
mai.com, amazon.com and hotmail.com, we also see at-
tacks against a large range of smaller and medium sized
businesses.

Top-Level Domain
Figure 7: Distribution of attacks to the 10 top-level domains
(TLDs) that received the most number of attacks.
6.3.2 Top-level domains
Figure 7 shows the distribution of attacks to the 10 most
frequently targeted top-level domains (TLDs). For each
TLD displayed on the x-axis, we show one value for each
of the three weeks of our study in progressive shades of
grey. Note that the TLDs are sorted by overall attacks
across all three weeks.
Comparing the number of attacks to each TLD from
week to week, we see that there is little variation. Each
TLD is targeted by roughly the same percentage of at-
tacks each week. The domain unknown represents
those attacks in which a reverse DNS lookup failed on
the victim IP address (just under 30% of all attacks). In
terms of the “three-letter” domains, both com and net
were each targeted by roughly 15% of the attacks, but
edu and org were only targeted by 2–4% of the at-
tacks. This is not surprising, as sites in the com and net
present more attractive and newsworthy targets. Interest-
ingly, although one might have expected attacks to sites
in mil, mil did not show up in any of our reverse DNS
lookups. We do not yet know what to conclude from this
result; for example, it could be that mil targets fall into
our unknown category.
In terms of the country-code TLDs, we see that there
is a disproportionate concentration of attacks to a small
group of countries. Surprisingly, Romania (ro), a coun-
try with a relatively poor networking infrastructure, was
targeted nearly as frequently as net and com, and Brazil
(br) was targeted almost more than edu and org com-
bined. Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom were
all were targeted by 1–2% of attacks.
6.3.3 Autonomous Systems
As another aggregation of attack targets, we exam-
ined the distribution of attacks to Autonomous Systems
(ASes). To determine the origin AS number associated
