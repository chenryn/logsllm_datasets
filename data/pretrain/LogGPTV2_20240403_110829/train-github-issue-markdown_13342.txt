If a cluster is shutdown (all nodes at once), while there is a process running
to increase the number of replicas, the index stays in a `UNASSIGNED` state
with no messages in the logs.  
If the number of replica is changed again the index comes back.
Steps to reproduce:
  1. spin up a cluster with at least 3 nodes
  2. Index some data (should be enough data for the replicas assignment to take some time)
  3. Change replicas to 0 `curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_settings' -d '{ "index" : {"number_of_replicas" : 0 }}'`
  4. Raise number of replicas `curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_settings' -d '{ "index" : {"number_of_replicas" : 1 }}'` and shut down all nodes before the replicas have been fully assigned.
  5. Start all nodes again
  6. The Index will stay in an `UNASSIGNED` state, but there is nothing in the logs on why this is the case.
  7. Changing the number of replicas to 0 again, will bring back the index into a `STARTED` state.
Reproduced on 2.0 and 2.1.
