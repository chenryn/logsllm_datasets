connect to each proxy and, if successful, determine whether
the proxy is a HTTP, CONNECT, or SOCKS proxy.
(3) Fetch:
Finally, we request several files (URLs) from the set
of proxies that we were successfully able to classify.
In more detail, during the Fetch step, we retrieve the following
files from each proxy that we were able to classify, using unen-
crypted HTTP connections: an HTML page, a Flash object (.swf),
a Windows executable (.exe), a JPEG image, a ZIP file, a Windows
batch (.bat) file, a Linux/UNIX shell script (.sh), and a Java JAR
archive. With the exception of the .exe file (explained in more de-
tail in §7), the URLs are hosted on web servers at Georgetown
University.
For CONNECT and SOCKS proxies (i.e., the proxies that support
TLS), we also request files over HTTPS from a properly config-
ured (i.e., with a valid certificate) web server running at George-
town University. We additionally request HTML files from https:
//revoked.badssl.com/ and https://self-signed.badssl.com/ which,
respectively, use revoked and self-signed certificates. The rationale
for fetching content from sites with invalid certificates is discussed
in §8. In all cases, we set the User-Agent HTTP request header
to match that of Google Chrome version 62.0.3202.94 running on
Mac OS X.
For each proxy request, we record whether the request completed.
If we received a response from the proxy, we also record the HTTP
status code and response string (e.g., “200 OK”) returned by the
proxy, the size of the response, the content of the response, the
254ACSAC ’18, December 3–7, 2018, San Juan, PR, USA
A. Mani et al.
MIME-type of the response (as determined by filemagic), the time-
to-last-byte (TTLB) for receiving the response, the HTTP response
headers, and (in the case of HTTPS requests) the certificate received.
Throughout the remainder of this paper, we use the term ex-
pected content to refer to the correct contents of the file and unex-
pected content to refer to content returned by a proxy that does
not match the file indicated by the requested URL. A correctly func-
tioning open proxy should thus return the expected content. As we
explore in more detail below, unexpected content does not necessar-
ily indicate malicious behavior. For instance, unexpected content
could be an HTML page indicating that the proxy is misconfigured
or that the proxy requires user authentication.
We remark that a weakness of our study, and one that we share
with studies that examine similar (mis)behavior in anonymity and
proxy services [20, 46, 54], is that we cannot easily differentiate
between manipulation that occurs at a proxy and manipulation
that occurs somewhere along the path between the proxy and
the destination. Our findings of misbehavior can be viewed as
indications that a proxy should not be used, either because it was
itself malicious or because its network location makes traffic routed
through it routinely vulnerable.
5 PROXY AVAILABILITY & PERFORMANCE
The number of unique proxies listed by proxy aggregator sites, over
time, is shown in Figure 1. The median number of proxies listed
on the aggregator sites over all days in the measurement period is
41,520, with a range of [38,843; 48,296]. In total, during the course
of our study, we indexed approximately 107,000 unique proxies that
were listed on aggregator sites.
We find that more than 92% of open proxies that are ad-
vertised on proxy aggregator sites are offline or otherwise
unavailable. Figure 2 plots the number of responsive proxies over
time for which we were able to establish at least one connection and
retrieve content. We remark that the Figure includes proxies that
returned unexpected content. Across our measurement study, the
median daily number of responsive proxies is 3,283; the medians
for HTTP, CONNECT, and SOCKS proxies are 1,613; 1,525; and 74,
respectively.
We use the MaxMind GeoLite2 City and ASN databases [36] to
resolve each proxy’s IP address to a physical location and an au-
tonomous system (AS). Tables 2 and 4 respectively report the most
frequent locations and ASes from among the proxies that are listed,
responsive (i.e., respond to proxy requests), and successfully deliver
the expected content at least once. There is surprisingly little
geographic and network diversity among the proxies. Ten
countries are responsible for nearly three-quarters of the world’s
working proxies, while Brazil alone is home to nearly 20% of the
proxies that forward expected content.
Similarly, a handful of ASes are privy to traffic from a dispro-
portionate amount of the open proxies. In particular, U.S.-based
DigitalOcean and the Chinese No. 31 Jin-rong Street AS each host
approximately 7% of the working proxies. In general, the distribu-
tion of open proxies on the Internet is very skewed, with roughly
40% of proxies confined to only 10 ASes. Moreover, open proxies
are found on only a small fraction of the Internet: although more
than 31,000 proxies accepted proxy requests during the course of
our experiment, they resided on just 2,971 (5.8%) of the Internet’s
approximately 51,500 autonomous systems [3].
We identified Squid, an open-source cacheing proxy, as the most
frequent proxy software among the relays that (i) responded to
our client requests and (ii) inserted a self-identifying Via or X-Via
HTTP header. As shown in Table 3, Squid was used by over 85% of
such proxies. Overall, we identified 130 different self-reported proxy
software systems, although we note that not all proxies include Via
or X-Via HTTP headers (84.43% do not) and that such headers are
easily forged and may not actually reflect the actual software.
As reported in Figure 4, approximately 62% of working proxies
listened on TCP ports 8080, 3128, or 20183. Port 8080 is an alterna-
tive port frequently used for web traffic or cacheing servers, and
3128 is the default port used by Squid. The popularity of port 20183
is surprising; it is not listed as a standard port by the Internet As-
signed Numbers Authority (IANA). The standard web port, port
80, is used by 7% of open proxies. The frequent use of ports 8080
and 3128 by open proxies provides a potential means of discovering
additional potential proxies: Censys, which is based on ZMap [26]
Internet scans, reports 7.3M Internet hosts listening on port 8080;
Shodan lists 1.1M hosts with services listening on port 3128 [11].
As we discuss in §10, we limit our study to only the proxies whose
addresses are listed publicly by aggregator sites, and thus for eth-
ical reasons do not probe these additional 8.4M hosts to discover
unlisted proxies.
5.1 Performance
We evaluate the performance of proxies by considering goodput,
computed as the size of a fetched file (we use a 1MiB file) divided
by the time taken to download it through a proxy. We consider
only instances in which the response reflects the expected con-
tent (i.e., the 1MiB file). Figure 5 shows the range of proxies’ daily
average goodput for requests that yielded the expected content.
Overall, the average goodput for such proxies is 128.5KiBps, with
an interquartile range (IQR) of [39.5; 160.9] KiBps.
We also consider proxies’ utility over time. A proxy that offers
high goodput but functions only sporadically is not particularly
useful. We define the success rate to be the fraction of proxy re-
quests that were successfully completed and yielded the expected
content. Figure 6 plots proxies’ success rates as a function of their
average goodput. We note that, generally, the proxies that offer the
highest goodput (highlighted in the Figure with the oval) also tend
to offer the highest success rates. The existence of stratified “lines”
when the success rate is 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 is somewhat surprising:
this indicates a regular periodicity or schedule during which these
proxies are available.
5.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Content
Proxies do not always return the expected content. However, not all
unexpected content is malicious. For example, many tested proxies
return a login page or a page conveying an authentication error,
regardless of the requested URL. These indicate that the listed open
proxy is either misconfigured, actually a private proxy, or is some
other misconfigured service. Here, we answer the question: to what
extent do listed open proxies return the expected content?
For our analysis, we consider the proxies that have responded
to at least one proxy request with a non-zero byte response and a
