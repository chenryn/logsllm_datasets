User: Use Python to write a simple port scanner to scan whether the host's ports are open. You can enter the target host and port range, scan whether the host's ports are open, and list the open port numbers.
Assistant: The following code implements a simple port scanner, which can input the target host and port range, scan whether the host's port is open, and list the open port number. The sample code is as follows: import socket# Get the host name and port range host = input("Please enter the host name:") start_port = int(input("Please enter the starting port number:")) end_port = int(input("Please enter End port number: "))# Scan whether the port is open, and list all open port numbers for port in range(start_port, end_port+1): s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) s.settimeout (0.1) try: s.connect((host, port)) print("Port %d is open" % port) except: pass finally: s.close()
