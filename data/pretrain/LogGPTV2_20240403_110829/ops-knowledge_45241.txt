User: Is is possible to detect if a Python script was started from the command prompt or by a user "double clicking" a .py file in the file explorer on Windows?
Assistant: The command-prompt started script has a parent process named cmd.exe (or a non-existent process, in case the console has been closed in the mean time). 
The doubleclick-started script should have a parent process named explorer.exe.
