### Figure 4: Distribution of Long-Distance Links
- **Plot (a)**: Summarizes the average link length as a function of Node ID for different link construction algorithms.
- **Plots (b) to (e)**: Provide detailed information about the links constructed by each algorithm. The Y-axis represents the ID of the \( k = \log n \) neighbors for each node on the X-axis. Nodes are consecutively arranged on the hub circle. Total number of nodes: 10000.
- **HistoLink [k1 : k2]**: Indicates that \( k1 \) nodes were queried per round, each providing \( k2 \) estimate reports. 5 exchange rounds were performed.

### Overhead of the Sampling Method
- The overhead is minimal as the samples can be easily multiplexed and piggy-backed over regular keep-alive pings by appending the IP address of the requesting node.
- If samples are uniformly distributed, each node receives \( O(1) \) sample requests per sampling period, resulting in very small overhead.

### Section 5.2: Node Count Histograms
- **Objective**: Evaluate the accuracy of node-count histograms obtained by nodes using the mechanism described in Section 4.2.
- **Histograms**: Provide an estimate of the total number of nodes in the system and help in establishing long-distance links correctly.
- **Accuracy Measurement**: Measured in terms of L1 norm distance from the "true" histogram.

**Experiment Details:**
- 10 rounds of exchanges were performed.
- **Figure 5(a)**: Plots the average accuracy of the histogram (averaged over all nodes) as the parameters for the histogram maintenance process are varied.
- **Observations**:
  - The error is consistently small and decreases rapidly as the number of nodes queried per round increases.
  - Similar patterns are observed when the number of reports queried from each node is increased.
  - This is expected as the number of samples received by each node per round grows linearly with either parameter.

**Figure 5(b)**: Plots the overall node-count estimates produced by each node in a system of \( n = 10000 \) nodes. The experiment was run for 10 exchange rounds with \( k1 = k2 = \log n \). The estimates are tightly clustered around the actual node-count value of 10000.

**Histogram Maintenance Process:**
- Each node queries \( k1 \) randomly sampled nodes and receives \( k2 \) estimate samples from each node.
- Messaging overhead per round per node is proportional to \( k1 \times k2 \).

### Section 5.3: Routing Performance
- **Objective**: Evaluate the overall routing performance of Mercury, considering the effects of random-walk based sampling.
- **Figure 5(c)**: Shows the effect of changing parameters on overall routing performance.

**Observations:**
- The graph shows some fluctuations, but their magnitudes are tiny, likely due to experimental variations.

**Histogram Error (L1-Distance):**
- **Figure 5(a)**: Plots the average histogram error as the number of nodes queried per round is varied.
- **Figure 5(b)**: Shows the node count estimates gathered by each node.
- **Figure 5(c)**: Demonstrates the effect of changing parameters on overall routing performance.
