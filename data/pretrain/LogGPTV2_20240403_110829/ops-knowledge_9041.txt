User: so far I used the Komodo IDE for Python development, but I'm now testing Eclipse with PyDev. Everything works fine, but there is one Komodo feature that I'm missing.
In Komodo I can inspect the running application in a debugger shell. I.e. after hitting a breakpoint I can not only read the content of variables, but I can execute arbitrary Python code (e.g. changing the value of variables) and then continue program execution.
PyDev has also some interactive shell during debugging, but I can only read variables and not change their content. Is this feature not available in PyDev or am I missing something here?
Many thanks,
 Axel
Assistant: Yes you can do that.  Just type in the console what ever commands you want :). I usually have to right click then 

Debug As >> Python run

PyDev is a little bit quirky, but you get used to it.
