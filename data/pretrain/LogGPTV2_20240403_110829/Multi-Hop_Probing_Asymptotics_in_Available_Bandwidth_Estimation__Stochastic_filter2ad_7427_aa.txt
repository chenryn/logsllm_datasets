Abstract
This paper analyzes the asymptotic behavior of packet-train
probing over a multi-hop network path P carrying arbitrar-
ily routed bursty cross-trafﬁc ﬂows. We examine the sta-
tistical mean of the packet-train output dispersions and its
relationship to the input dispersion. We call this relation-
ship the response curve of path P. We show that the real
response curve Z is tightly lower-bounded by its multi-hop
ﬂuid counterpart F, obtained when every cross-trafﬁc ﬂow
on P is hypothetically replaced with a constant-rate ﬂuid
ﬂow of the same average intensity and routing pattern. The
real curve Z asymptotically approaches its ﬂuid counter-
part F as probing packet size or packet train length in-
creases. Most existing measurement techniques are based
upon the single-hop ﬂuid curve S associated with the bot-
tleneck link in P. We note that the curve S coincides with
F in a certain large-dispersion input range, but falls below
F in the remaining small-dispersion input ranges. As an
implication of these ﬁndings, we show that bursty cross-
trafﬁc in multi-hop paths causes negative bias (asymptotic
underestimation) to most existing techniques. This bias can
be mitigated by reducing the deviation of Z from S using
large packet size or long packet-trains. However, the bias
is not completely removable for the techniques that use the
portion of S that falls below F.

Introduction
End-to-end estimation of the spare capacity along a net-
work path using packet-train probing has recently become
an important Internet measurement research area. Several
measurement techniques such as TOPP [14], Pathload [6],
IGI/PTR [5], Pathchirp [16], and Spruce [17] have been de-
veloped. Most of the current proposals use a single-hop
path with constant-rate ﬂuid cross-trafﬁc to justify their
methods. The behavior and performance of these tech-
niques in a multi-hop path with general bursty cross-trafﬁc
is limited to experimental evaluations. Recent work [9] ini-
tiated the effort of developing an analytical foundation for
bandwidth measurement techniques. Such a foundation is
important in that it helps achieve a clear understanding of
both the validity and the inadequacy of current techniques
and provides a guideline to improve them. However, the
analysis in [9] is restricted to single-hop paths. There is
still a void to ﬁll in understanding packet-train bandwidth
estimation over a multi-hop network path.
Recall that the available bandwidth of a network hop is
its residual capacity after transmitting cross-trafﬁc within a
certain time interval. This metric varies over time as well
as a wide range of observation time intervals. However, in
this paper, we explicitly target the measurement of a long-
term average available bandwidth, which is a stable metric
independent of observation time instances and observation
time intervals [9]. Consider an N-hop network path P =
(L1, L2, . . . , LN ), where the capacity of link Li is denoted
by Ci and the long-term average of the cross-trafﬁc arrival
rate at Li is given by λi, which is assumed to be less than
Ci. The hop available bandwidth of Li is Ai = Ci − λi.
The path available bandwidth AP is given by
AP = min
1≤i≤N
(Ci − λi).
(1)
The hop Lb, which carries the minimum available band-
width, is called the tight link or the bottleneck link1. That
is,
b = arg min
1≤i≤N
(Ci − λi).
(2)
The main idea of packet-train bandwidth estimation is
to infer AP from the relationship between the inter-packet
dispersions of the output packet-trains and those of the in-
put packet-trains. Due to the complexity of this relationship
in arbitrary network paths with bursty cross-trafﬁc ﬂows,
previous work simpliﬁes the analysis using a single-hop
path with ﬂuid2 cross-trafﬁc, while making the following
two assumptions without formal justiﬁcation: ﬁrst, cross-
trafﬁc burstiness only causes measurement variability that
can be smoothed out by averaging multiple probing sam-

ples and second, non-bottleneck links have negligible im-
pact on the proposed techniques.
The validity of the ﬁrst assumption is partially addressed
in [9], where the authors use a single-hop path with bursty
cross-trafﬁc to derive the statistical mean of the packet-
train output dispersions as a function of the input prob-
ing dispersion, referred to as the single-hop response curve.
Their analysis shows that besides measurement variability,
cross-trafﬁc burstiness can also cause measurement bias
to the techniques that are based on ﬂuid analysis. This
measurement bias cannot be reduced even when an inﬁnite
number of probing samples are used, but can be mitigated
using long packet-trains and/or large probing packet size.
This paper addresses further the two assumptions that
current techniques are based on. To this end, we extend
the asymptotic analysis in [9] to arbitrary network paths
and uncover the nature of the measurement bias caused by
bursty cross-trafﬁc ﬂows in a multi-hop network path. This
problem is signiﬁcantly different from previous single-hop
analysis due to the following reasons. First, unlike single-
hop measurements, where the input packet-trains have de-
terministic and equal inter-packet separation formed by the
probing source, the input packet-trains at any hop (ex-
cept the ﬁrst one) along a multi-link path are output from
the previous hop and have random structure. Second and
more importantly, the multi-hop probing asymptotics are
strongly related to the routing pattern of cross-trafﬁc ﬂows.
This issue never arises in a single-hop path and it has re-
ceived little attention in prior investigation. However, as
we show in this paper, it is one of the most signiﬁcant fac-
tors that affect the accuracy of bandwidth measurement in
multi-hop paths.
To characterize packet-train bandwidth estimation in its
most general settings, we derive the probing response curve
Z of a multi-hop path P assuming arbitrarily routed bursty
cross-trafﬁc ﬂows. We compare Z with its multi-hop ﬂuid
counterpart F, which is a response curve obtained when
every cross-trafﬁc ﬂow in P is hypothetically replaced with
a ﬂuid ﬂow of the same average intensity and routing pat-
tern. We show, under an ergodic stationarity assumption
for each cross-trafﬁc ﬂow, that the real curve Z is tightly
lower bounded by its ﬂuid counterpart F and that the curve
Z asymptotically approaches its ﬂuid bound F in the entire
input range as probing packet size or packet-train length in-
creases.
Most of the existing techniques are based on the single-
hop ﬂuid response curve S associated with the bottleneck
link in P. Therefore, any deviation of the real curve Z from
the single-hop curve S can potentially cause measurement
bias in bandwidth estimation. Note that the deviation Z −S
can be decomposed as
Z − S = (Z − F) + (F − S).
(3)
The ﬁrst term Z − F is always positive and causes asymp-
totic underestimation of AP for most of the existing tech-
niques. This deviation term and its resulting measurement
bias are “elastic” in the sense that they can be reduced to
a negligible level using packet-trains of sufﬁcient length3.
For the second deviation term F − S, we note that both S
and F are piece-wise linear curves. The ﬁrst two linear seg-
ments in F associated with large input dispersions coincide
with S (i.e., F − S = 0). The rest of the linear segments
in F associated with small input dispersions appear above
S (i.e., F − S > 0). The amount of deviation and the
additional negative measurement bias it causes are depen-
dent on the routing patterns of cross-trafﬁc ﬂows, and are
maximized when every ﬂow traverses only one hop along
the path (which is often called one-hop persistent cross-
trafﬁc routing [4]). Furthermore, the curve deviation F − S
is “non-elastic” and stays constant with respect to probing
packet size and packet-train length at any given input rate.
Therefore, the measurement bias it causes cannot be over-
come by adjusting the input packet-train parameters.
Among current measurement techniques, pathload and
PTR operate in the input probing range where F coincides
with S, and consequently are only subject to the measure-
ment bias caused by the ﬁrst deviation term Z − F. Spruce
may use the probing range where F − S > 0. Hence it
is subject to both elastic and non-elastic negative measure-
ment biases. The amount of bias can be substantially more
than the actual available bandwidth in certain common sce-
narios, leading to negative results by the measurement al-
gorithm and a ﬁnal estimate of zero by the tool.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
derives the multi-hop response curve F assuming arbitrar-
ily routed ﬂuid cross-trafﬁc ﬂows and examines the devi-
ation term F − S. In Section 3 and 4, we derive the real
response curve Z of a multi-hop path and show its relation-
ship to its ﬂuid counterpart F. We provide practical evi-
dence for our theoretical results using testbed experiments
and real Internet measurements in Section 5. We examine
the impact of these results on existing techniques in Sec-
tion 6 and summarize related work in Section 7. Finally,
we brieﬂy discuss future work and conclude in Section 8.
Due to limited space, most of the proofs in this paper are
omitted, and we refer interested readers to [10] for more
technical details.
2 Multi-Hop Fluid Analysis
It is important to ﬁrst thoroughly understand the response
curve F of a network path carrying ﬂuid cross-trafﬁc ﬂows,
since as we show later, the ﬂuid curve F is an approachable
bound of the real response curve Z. Initial investigation of
the ﬂuid curves is due to Melandar et al. [13] and Dovrolis
et al. [3]. However, prior work only considers two spe-
cial cross-trafﬁc routing cases (one-hop persistent routing
and path persistent routing). In this section, we formulate

terns, based on which, we discuss several important prop-
erties of the ﬂuid response curves that allow us to obtain
the path available bandwidth information.
2.1 Formulating A Multi-Hop Path
We ﬁrst introduce necessary notations to formulate a multi-
hop path and the cross-trafﬁc ﬂows that traverse along the
path.
An N-hop network path P = (L1, L2, . . . , LN ) is
a sequence of N interconnected First-Come First-Served
(FCFS) store-and-forward hops. For each forwarding hop
Li in P, we denote its link capacity by Ci, and assume
that it has inﬁnite buffer space and a work-conserving queu-
ing discipline. Suppose that there are M ﬂuid cross-trafﬁc
ﬂows traversing path P. The rate of ﬂow j is denoted by xj
and the ﬂow rate vector is given by x = (x1, x2, . . . , xM ).
We impose two routing constraints on cross-trafﬁc ﬂows
to simplify the discussion. The ﬁrst constraint requires
every ﬂow to have a different routing pattern. In the case of
otherwise, the ﬂows with the same routing pattern should
be aggregated into one single ﬂow. The second routing con-
straint requires every ﬂow to have only one link where it
enters the path and also have only one (downstream) link
where it exits from the path. In the case of otherwise, the
ﬂow is decomposed into several separate ﬂows that meet
this routing constraint.
Deﬁnition 1 A ﬂow aggregation is a set of ﬂows, repre-
sented by a “selection vector” p = (p1, p2, . . . , pM )T ,
where pj = 1 if ﬂow j belongs to the aggregation and
pj = 0 if otherwise. We use fj to represent the selection
vector of the aggregation that contains ﬂow j alone.
There are several operations between ﬂow aggregations.
First, the common ﬂows to aggregations p and q form an-
other aggregation, whose selection vector is given by p(cid:12)q,
where the operator (cid:12) represents “element-wise multiplica-
tion.” Second, the aggregation that contains the ﬂows in p
but not in q is given by p − p (cid:12) q. Finally, note that the
trafﬁc intensity of aggregation p can be computed from the
inner product xp.
We now deﬁne several types of ﬂow aggregation fre-
quently used in this paper. First, the traversing ﬂow ag-
gregation at link Li, denoted by its selection vector ri, in-
cludes all ﬂuid ﬂows that pass through Li. The M × N
matrix R = (r1, r2, . . . , rN ) becomes the routing matrix
of path P. For convenience, we deﬁne an auxiliary selec-
tion vector r0 = 0.
The second type of ﬂow aggregation, denoted by ei, in-
cludes all ﬂows entering the path at link Li, which can be
expressed as ei = ri − ri (cid:12) ri−1 given the second rout-
ing constraint stated previously. The third type of ﬂow
aggregation, which includes ﬂows that enter the path at
link Lk and traverse the downstream link Li, is denoted
as Γk,i = ek (cid:12) ri, where k ≤ i.
The cross-trafﬁc intensity at link Li is denoted by λi. We

Proof: Assumes that the ﬁrst probing packet arrives
at link Li at time instance a1. It gets immediate transmis-
sion service and departs at a1+s/Ci. The second packet ar-
rives at a1 +γi−1. The server of Li needs to transmit s+Ωi
amount of data before it can serve the second packet. If this
is done before time instance a1 + γi−1, the second packet
also gets immediate service and γi = γi−1. Otherwise, the
sever undergoes a busy period between the departure of the
two packets, meaning that γi = (s + Ωi)/Ci. Therefore,
we have
γi = max(cid:18)γi−1,

This completes the proof of the theorem.
As a quick sanity check, we verify the compatibility be-
tween Theorem 1 and the special one-hop persistent routing
case, where every ﬂow that enters the path at link Li will
exit the path at link Li+1. For this routing pattern, we have
