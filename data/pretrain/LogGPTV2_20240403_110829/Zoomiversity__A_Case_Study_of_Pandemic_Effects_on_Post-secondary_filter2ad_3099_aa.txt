Abstract. The ﬁrst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit North Amer-
ica in March 2020, disrupting personal and professional lives, and leading
to work-from-home mandates in many jurisdictions. In this paper, we
examine two years of empirical network traﬃc measurement data from
the University of Calgary’s campus network to study the eﬀects of the
pandemic on a post-secondary education environment. Our study focuses
on the online meeting applications and services used, as well as traﬃc
volumes, directionality, and diurnal patterns, as observed from our cam-
pus edge network. The main highlights from our study include: changes
to inbound and outbound traﬃc volumes; reduced traﬃc asymmetry; sig-
niﬁcant growth in Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and VPN traﬃc; structural
changes in workday traﬃc patterns; and a more global distribution of
campus network users.

1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic aﬀected everyone’s daily life, both personally and pro-
fessionally. Lockdowns, travel restrictions, and stay-at-home orders were in eﬀect
in most parts of the world in 2020, and they had many consequences on people
individually and socially. The way that people work and study changed quite
drastically, with many people relying much more extensively upon the Internet
and online tools for their daily tasks [11].
In a broader sense, the pandemic has provided a glimpse into the possible
Future of Work (FoW) [4,23,29], a term used to describe a ﬂexible work-from-
home society enabled by digital connectivity, telepresence, and computer net-
works. With the continuous move to the cloud infrastructures within the orga-
nizations and universities around the world [12], most people were aware of the
possibility of working remotely before the pandemic occurred, but relatively few
have done it. At the very least, the pandemic accelerated the transition to FoW
and made it real for many more people, changing some mindsets and possibly
inﬂuencing remote work and online learning technologies for the future.

In this paper, we study the eﬀects of the pandemic within the context of a
post-secondary education environment. We do so from a network-level viewpoint,
by studying the changes in the Internet traﬃc patterns into and out of our
campus network. Speciﬁcally, we examine two years of empirical connection-level
network traﬃc data to identify changes in the volume, timing, and directionality
of traﬃc, as well as the application mix. Doing so oﬀers insights into how the
pandemic aﬀected the work and study habits of our campus community.
A main focus in our study is on the use of Zoom video-conferencing software,
which was adopted by University of Calgary (UCalgary) as the preferred solution
for remote teaching and learning. Zoom has been adopted by many universities,
companies, and other organizations for remote communication purposes.
Zoom is a popular and easy-to-use video-conferencing solution. Zoom oﬀers
a free account with some limitations, such as a maximum meeting duration of
40 minutes. However, many organizations (including UCalgary) purchased the
corporate license for Zoom so that their members could use it for teaching and
learning, as well as meetings and conferences, without the duration limit.
Zoom, of course, is not the only video-conferencing solution on the market.
Microsoft Teams and Google Meet are two other online conferencing applications
used by our campus community for meeting purposes. Some features are free for
the public to use, and the rest are accessible only to licensed organizations. Other
popular solutions include FaceTime, Skype, Vidyo, and Webex.
In our work, we study the network traﬃc of three online meeting applications
on our university campus network. We focus on characterizing the network traﬃc
from these applications, as seen on our campus. As a baseline, we provide pre-
pandemic traﬃc measurements from 2019 and the early months of 2020, and
compare 2020 traﬃc with this baseline.
Our main objectives are to answer the following questions:
– How has the campus network traﬃc changed during the pandemic, and why?
– What are the usage patterns for Zoom as the most prominent online video
conferencing application on our campus?
– What other network applications and services are used to support remote
– What are the potential implications of these changes on the future usage of
work and learning?
our campus network?
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
– We compare empirical network traﬃc data from 2019 (pre-pandemic) and
2020 (pandemic) to identify structural changes in traﬃc patterns.
– We identify the emergence of Zoom and Teams as popular applications for
teaching and for meetings, respectively, and characterize Zoom usage.
– We identify temporal and geo-spatial changes in how our research and edu-
cation community accesses and uses campus network resources.
The results from our work should be of value not only to networking
researchers, but also to educators, academic administrators, and IT profession-
als. Using longitudinal data analysis, we provide several key insights on the

growth and evolution of network traﬃc for online learning, and the performance
implications of such traﬃc on a campus edge network.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses prior related
work on network traﬃc characterization and the eﬀects of the COVID-19 pan-
demic. Section 3 describes the methodology for our study, focusing on our net-
work environment, our network traﬃc measurement infrastructure, and our data
analysis tools. Section 4 presents the main high-level results from our study, while
Sect. 5 provides detailed results regarding Zoom traﬃc. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes
the paper.
2 Related Work
Researchers in academia and in industry rely on network traﬃc measurement as
an increasingly important methodology to obtain data, analyze Internet traﬃc,
assess network performance, identify network security issues, and investigate
diﬀerent features of new protocols and applications. The book by Crovella and
Krishnamurthy [9] provides the technical underpinnings of this discipline.
The usage of network traﬃc measurement and workload characterization
techniques is broad and extensive. Classic examples include the characterization
of wide-area TCP connections [25], Web traﬃc [3,6], and email traﬃc [28]. More
recent works have studied video streaming services [1,13], as well as the growth
and evolution of online social networks [15,22,30]. Such studies oﬀer insights
into the changing nature of Internet traﬃc, and its potential eﬀects on network
performance. We follow a similar approach in our work.
The COVID-19 pandemic has aﬀected Internet usage dramatically. Since the
onset of the pandemic, several research works have noted changes in the timing,
volume, and directionality of traﬃc, as many people switched to work-from-
home scenarios. One of the ﬁrst was the weekly blog by Labovitz [16], analyzing
data from several networks in Western Europe. As of March 9, 2020, this report
noted 20-40% increases in traﬃc during the evening peak hours, 3x growth in
teleconferencing apps (e.g., Skype, Zoom), and 4x growth in gaming traﬃc [16].
A later report [17] indicated that aggregate traﬃc was up by over 25%, and that
the normalized peak traﬃc was 25-30% above pre-pandemic levels. Also, DDoS
attacks increased by 40-50% after the pandemic [17]. Similar observations arise
in our work, along with insights that are speciﬁc to Zoom traﬃc.
The Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG) produced a
detailed report on how Internet traﬃc changed, and how network operators and
providers managed the unprecedented circumstances [5]. Though focused on the
US, this report provides valuable insights into network operations from many dif-
ferent vantage points, including core, edge, and ISP locations. The report states
that the Internet, in general, was robust during the pandemic, and continued
to perform well. Several performance issues experienced by some users were
attributed to end-user system conﬁgurations and outdated wireless equipment.
Dramatic growth in VPN usage by campus networks is also reported in this doc-
ument, along with the notable asymmetry in traﬃc growth between upstream
576

and downstream. The busy hours for the downstream were in the evening with
12-25% growth, while the upstream peak hours start in the morning and run
most of the day until about midnight. Our results also conﬁrm VPN traﬃc
growth, and noticable shifts in network usage patterns.
Feldmann et al. [11] provided a multi-perspective look at pandemic eﬀects
on Internet traﬃc, using datasets from ISPs, IXPs, and mobile network opera-
tors. The main highlights were shifts of 15-20% in Internet traﬃc within a week
of lockdown. Their paper noted the emergence of non-hypergiants among the
contributors to traﬃc growth, and identiﬁed a plethora of network applications
being used in work-from-home environments. Our work conﬁrms Zoom as a new
potential hypergiant.
Lutu et al. [20] presented an analysis of the changes in user mobility pat-
terns and how this aﬀected the cellular traﬃc of a UK mobile network operator.
They observed an overall decrease in mobility (i.e., roaming) by 50%, with non-
uniform geographical changes. They reported a 150% increase in voice traﬃc, a
20% overall decrease in download traﬃc, and a 10% increase in uplink traﬃc.
Nonetheless, the network operator was able to maintain service quality stan-
dards. Our work does not address cellular traﬃc at all, but we do see reduced
WiFi usage from having fewer people on campus.
Liu et al. [19] studied how several US providers responded to changes in Inter-
net traﬃc demands during the pandemic. They also identiﬁed some diﬀerences
between rural versus urban users, which can aﬀect QoS/QoE for online learning
applications. The shift to using online meeting applications and platforms for
learning and collaboration is also well documented in the literature [26,27]. Our
work indicates potential performance problems when Zoom is used for teaching
and learning on a large campus edge network.
The closest study to our own so far is by Favale et al. [10], who studied traﬃc
on the campus network of the Politecnico di Torino (PoliTO). They analyzed
the changes in traﬃc patterns due to the restrictions in place in Turin, Italy, and
the switch to online learning solutions. They observed that the campus inbound
traﬃc drastically decreased, since fewer students were on campus, while out-
bound traﬃc more than doubled, due to the remote learning platform installed
at the campus to support all online classroom instruction. Furthermore, they
provided insight into the growth of online collaboration platforms, VPN, and
remote desktop services. Compared to their work, our research spans an entire
calendar year of pandemic-related network traﬃc data (2020), rather than just a
few months, with the previous calendar year (2019) as a baseline. Furthermore,
our campus uses the widely-adopted Zoom platform for remote teaching and
learning, rather than a custom in-house solution. We provide observations on
how the usage of online learning and meeting applications has changed in terms
of connection counts and traﬃc volume, and oﬀer insights into these changes.
A recent paper [7] studied three major videoconferencing systems: Zoom,
Webex, and Google Meet. They used a cloud-based emulated framework to gen-
erate videoconferencing sessions on these applications and then measure, study,
and compare them. They measured streaming delay (lag), as well as a range
Zoomiversity: A Case Study of Pandemic
577
of well-known objective QoE metrics, including PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure), and VIFp (Pixel Visual
Information Fidelity). They found that these systems vary in terms of geographic
location, resulting in diﬀerent QoE. For example, Webex sessions created in US-
west are subject to artiﬁcial detours via relays in US-east, inﬂating their lags.
They saw that high-motion video feeds experience non-negligible QoE degra-
dation on all three systems compared to low-motion video streaming. Finally,
systems react diﬀerently under bandwidth constraints.
Another recent study [21] compared Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google
Meet in an experimental testbed. They tried to ﬁnd the baseline level of Inter-
net performance needed to support common videoconferencing applications for
remote learning. Under simulated conditions, they measured the bandwidth uti-
lization, time to recovery from interruptions, and fairness under competitive
circumstances.
Our work diﬀers from these papers too, as we study empirically-captured
network traﬃc data from thousands of users on our campus network. Our com-
panion paper [8] developed tools to analyze Zoom sessions and meetings from
these captured data and provides a microscopic view of Zoom traﬃc. This paper,
on the other hand, provides a longitudinal (macroscopic) view of Zoom, Teams,
Meet, VPN, and other applications involved in remote working and learning
during the pandemic.
3 Data Collection and Methodology
This section discusses the methods and technologies used for our network traﬃc
characterization study, as well as some of the limitations of our approach. We
start with some brief contextual information about the university environment
that we studied.
3.1 University Environment
UCalgary is a medium-sized university with about 30,000 students. The academic
schedule is semester-based, with the Fall (September to December) and Winter
(January to April) semesters each having a full set of course oﬀerings. There are
also Spring (May to June) and Summer (July to August) semesters, each with
reduced course oﬀerings.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the switch from in-person learning to
remote online learning took place quite abruptly on March 13th, 2020, dur-
ing the Winter semester. Online learning remained the norm throughout the
rest of the calendar year, though a small number of students (20%) were allowed
back on campus in Fall 2020, mainly in capstone and/or lab-based experiential
learning courses with limited enrollments.

Videoconferencing. With the shift to remote learning, the students, staﬀ, and
faculty members started to use online meetings and screen-sharing applications
to continue with the courses, academic tasks, and regular or occasional meet-
ings. The University oﬃcially advised its community to use Zoom for teaching
and learning, and it has been the dominant way of teaching classes since the
lockdown. Microsoft Teams is oﬀered for internal or external meetings. An orga-
nizational license was purchased for Zoom, and Microsoft Teams is an integrated
application within the Oﬃce365 suite available via a campus-wide licence.
Remote Access. Being physically away from campus raised access issues for
almost everyone. For example, many faculty, staﬀ, and graduate students needed
to access computers in their oﬃces or labs to proceed with their work or research.
Even undergraduate students using systems in diﬀerent labs before the lock-
down needed to connect remotely to those systems. Furthermore, certain services
require access from a university IP address, augmenting the demand to connect
to the campus network. Three diﬀerent remote access solutions were oﬀered to
resolve these issues: Secure Shell (SSH), Virtual Private Network (VPN), and
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
Authentication. Our campus network uses an authentication service that
checks user credentials before accessing enterprise resources, such as the wireless
network, learning management system, email, and Oﬃce365 applications.
3.2 Passive Measurement
Passive measurement involves capturing ambient network traﬃc and analyzing
it either online or oﬄine. With this technique, no additional traﬃc is produced,
and the ordinary network traﬃc is not altered in any way. We collected two years
of empirical network traﬃc data using this approach.
Our monitor uses an Endace DAG (Data Acquisition and Generation) packet
capture card. The monitor is installed in the main data center on campus, and
receives from the edge routers a mirrored copy of every packet entering or leav-
ing the campus network. Those packets are then sent to a Zeek (formerly known
as Bro) worker node [24]. For privacy purposes and to reduce storage require-
ments, Zeek aggregates all the packets of the same connection and stores a
summarized entry for that connection. This summary consists of many ﬁelds,
including a unique identiﬁer of the connection, the connection’s 4-tuple of end-
point addresses/ports, the time of the ﬁrst packet, duration of the connection,
and the number of packets and bytes sent by both the originator and responder.
We use ARC (Advanced Research Computing), an existing HPC (High Per-
formance Computing) cluster at UCalgary, for storage, management, and script-
based processing of our traﬃc data. We also use Vertica, an SQL-based big data
analytics platform, to analyze the captured data. Using Vertica is fast and con-
venient for network traﬃc analyses, since it supports parallel execution of SQL
queries on structured data [18].
