ABSTRACT
With a long history of compromising Internet security, Dis-
tributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have been inten-
sively investigated and numerous countermeasures have been
proposed to defend against them. In this work, we propose
a non-standard game-theoretic framework that facilitates
evaluation of DDoS attacks and defense. Our framework
can be used to study diverse DDoS attack scenarios where
multiple layers of protection are deployed and a number of
uncertain factors aﬀect the decision making of the players,
and it also allows us to model diﬀerent sophistication lev-
els of reasoning by both the attacker and the defender. We
conduct a variety of experiments to evaluate DDoS attack
and defense scenarios where one or more layers of defense
mechanisms are deployed, and demonstrate that our frame-
work sheds light on the interplay between decision makings
of both the attacker and the defender, as well as how they
aﬀect the outcomes of DDoS attack and defense games.

INTRODUCTION
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have been
plaguing the cyber space for a long time [29, 5, 26]. Accord-
ing to a VeriSign survey [25], almost two thirds of enterprise
companies were victims of DDoS attacks, and 11 percent
of them were attacked more than six times; also, there is a
high price tag to defend against DDoS attacks as the aver-
age cost was estimated at as much as 2.5 million dollars. To
ﬁght back against DDoS attacks, researchers have proposed
a number of countermeasures, many of which have been
covered in the comprehensive surveys by Mirkovic and Rei-
her [14] and Peng et al. [17]. Performance evaluation of these
methods, however, has been mostly conducted in a static en-
vironment (e.g., simulation [9, 11] or a controlled real-world
testbed [19, 15]) where behaviors of the attacker and the
defender are predeﬁned in an experiment. Although conclu-
sions drawn from these studies shed light on the strengths
and/or weaknesses of proposed defense techniques, they typ-
ically do not take into account strategic thinking of either
the attacker or the defender, and thus fail to characterize
accurately the dynamic interactions between the decisions
made by the attacker and the defender in a real-world DDoS
attack and defense incident.
In a few previous studies, evaluation of DDoS attacks and
defense has been performed in a game-theoretic context [22,
27, 31, 28, 20]. These studies typically formulated DDoS at-
tacks and defense as a static game (or a one-shot game) for
a speciﬁc DDoS defense mechanism such as pushback [12],
and studied the behaviors of the attacker and the defender
in an equilibrium state (e.g., Nash equilibrium). Although
these studies oﬀer insights into how the attacker and the de-
fender behave in a strategic manner in a DDoS attack and
defense game, they suﬀer from the following three major
shortcomings. First, these previous eﬀorts mainly focused
on the equilibrium states, particularly Nash equilibrium, in
553the strategy spaces of the attacker and the defender.
In
practice, however, both the attacker and the defender have
only bounded rationality due to limited information or re-
sources, which makes them diﬃcult, if not impossible, to
always take the best-response actions. This is particularly
true for DDoS attacks and defense because they usually take
place within a short period of time. Second, most previous
studies targeted one speciﬁc defense mechanism by the de-
fender, in which the defender’s decisions lie in how she sets
the parameters in the method, and did not consider exis-
tence of multiple layers of protection against DDoS attacks
commonly deployed in modern enterprise networks. Tradi-
tionally, game theorists use the mixed strategy approach
to integrate multiple possible actions by a player with a
probability distribution, but this method is inappropriate
for modeling defense in depth against DDoS attacks, as it
fails to model correlation among changes to the system state
by diﬀerent defense mechanisms. Third, in a real-life DDoS
attack and defense incident, the strategic thinking of both
the attacker and the defender is aﬀected by many uncertain
factors, such as how many legitimate users are using the
service, how much traﬃc is generated from each user, and
random packet dropping due to congestion at routers. Stan-
dard game theoretic methods such as extensive form games
commonly used in the previous studies often ignore or sim-
plify possible distributions behind these random events, and
thus do not provide a seamless and coherent way of quanti-
fying the eﬀects of these uncertain factors.
Due to these constraints, game theory has not yet been
widely applied in practice to evaluate DDoS attacks and
defense. Against this backdrop, in this work we develop a
game-theoretic evaluation framework, which is able to model
diﬀerent sophistication levels of strategic thinking by the at-
tacker and the defender, oﬀers great freedom in choosing
distributions characterizing legitimate traﬃc, and provides
a seamless method for reasoning among uncertain factors
in DDoS attacks and defense. Based on a semi network-
form game theoretical model proposed recently by Lee and
Wolpert [10], our evaluation framework leverages a Bayesian
graphical model for system state inference, where a set of
random variables are used to characterize system states in
DDoS attacks and defense and a directed acyclic graph to
model their conditional dependencies. For uncertain factors
such as the number of legitimate users which are decided by
the nature, the modeler can use distributions inferred from
historical data of the network. Dependencies among random
variables are modeled based on the underlying mechanisms
that govern the changes of system states. For instance, we
can model diﬀerent packet scheduling mechanisms at routers
and diﬀerent blocking methods by ﬁrewalls in this evalua-
tion framework. Due to the ﬂexibility of modeling depen-
dencies among random variables, the framework also allows
us to study multiple layers of protection against DDoS at-
tacks. Also, the level-K reasoning used in the framework
allows us to model players of diﬀerent sophistication levels.
A na¨ıve defender, for instance, may think that DDoS attacks
would never take place, and a more sophisticated defender,
however, will take into consideration how the attacker re-
sponds if she does this and how she should further respond
accordingly. Level-K thinking naturally reﬂects such type
of reasoning in practice by assuming that a player’s best re-
sponse at a certain level depends on her observations from
the previous one.
In this work, we use the proposed framework to evalu-
ate DDoS attacks and defense in a typical enterprise net-
work that deploys three layers of defense against DDoS at-
tacks, including adding extra bandwidth to the external link,
blocking suspicious traﬃc, and limiting the traﬃc rate from
each source. Assuming that the attacker uses a botnet to
launch DDoS attacks, he has the freedom to choose the num-
ber of bots in the attack and the sending rate per bot. We
also model normal traﬃc from legitimate users, and take
into consideration factors such as costs in adding more band-
width to the external link, capacity of the server, and the
detection rate and false alarm rate of the intrusion detec-
tion system. Using a variety of experiments with diverse
parameter settings, we demonstrate how diﬀerent sophisti-
cation levels of strategic thinking lead to diﬀerent outcomes
of a DDoS attack and defense game, how diﬀerent system
parameters (e.g., average number of legitimate users, band-
width price, server capacity, performance of intrusion de-
tection systems) aﬀect the decisions made by the attacker
and the defender, respectively, and how multiple layers of
defense against DDoS attacks complement each other when
they are put into eﬀect simultaneously.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
In
Section 2, we brieﬂy introduce the related work. Section 3
provides the motivation behind using the semi network-form
game to analyze DDoS attacks and defense. We introduce
system variables used in this framework in Section 4, how
to model conditional dependencies among them in Section 5,
and level-K reasoning in Section 6. We show how to use this
framework to analyze scenarios with a single layer of defense
in Section 7 and those with multiple layers of defense in
Section 8. Section 9 draws concluding remarks of this work.
2. RELATED WORK
The long history of DDoS attacks has inspired numerous
defense techniques. Mirkovic and Reiher proposed a taxon-
omy of DDoS attack and defense mechanisms [14], and Peng
et al. presented a survey of network-based DoS attacks and
defense techniques [17]. Game theory has been previously
applied to gain insights into cyber security issues. Roy et
al.
surveyed game-theoretic solutions to network security
applications, largely along the line of the types of games
used (i.e., static and dynamic games) and whether the in-
formation available to the players is perfect or imperfect,
and complete or incomplete [18]. Manshaei et al. surveyed
previous works on applying game-theoretic techniques to ad-
dress security and privacy problems [13].
Previously, there were a few eﬀorts on conducting game-
theoretic analysis of DDoS attacks and defense. Zang et
al. applied a Bayesian game model to analyze the defense
against DDoS attack traﬃc with unclear signatures [31]. In
their model, the defender is uncertain about the type of the
traﬃc origin, which can be either a legitimate user or an at-
tacker, and thus infers it using Bayesian rules. In [22], Sny-
der et al. introduced a DDoS traﬃc injection game, which is
a two-person zero-sum game with imperfect knowledge. In
the model developed by Wu et al. [27], the attacker attempts
to optimize the attack eﬀect by choosing the most eﬀective
attack traﬃc sending rate or number of zombie machines
to send out attack traﬃc, while the defender optimizes the
eﬀectiveness of ﬁltering attack traﬃc at the ﬁrewall. The en-
tire game works in a continuous setting and the Nash equi-
librium strategy can be computed analytically. In [28], Xu
554probability distribution from the Bayesian network given
some observed information, a player is assumed to sample
it in order to approximate system states. To speed up the
sampling process, the semi network-form game takes advan-
tage of the d-separation property of a Bayesian network and
likelihood weighting [8]. The tricky part in sampling is, how-
ever, how to deal with decision nodes, as no predeﬁned con-
ditional probability distributions are associated with them.
The semi network form game applies the following meth-
ods. First, when a player samples from her own decision
node, she use a predeﬁned satisﬁcing function that reﬂects
her preferences in her decision making. For instance, when
a person sees a car driving towards her, she would prefer to
shun towards the left with probability 30% (choice 1) and
the right with probability 70% (choice 2). Hence, when she
samples from her decision node, she would have 30% of sam-
ples with choice 1 and 70% with choice 2, but which choice
she eventually takes depends on her evaluation of the out-
come based on her utility function. Second, when player A
samples from player B’s decision node, she uses the classical
level-K strategy [3] for reasoning. With this strategy, player
A’s decision at a certain level k depends on how player B
reasons at level k − 1. The rigorous deﬁnition of a semi
network-form game model is provided in Appendix A.
Using the semi network-form game model to evaluate DDoS
attacks and defense has a few advantages. First, it provides
a seamless way of integrating multiple defense mechanisms.
The Bayesian network in it naturally models dependencies
among these components. For example, adding extra band-
width to the external link allows more traﬃc to arrive at
the ﬁrewall, which thus has to deal with more packets when
blocking suspicious traﬃc. Such dependencies are diﬃcult
to capture by traditional game theoretic methods such as the
mixed strategy approach. Second, uncertain factors such as
how much legitimate traﬃc is destined to the server and in-
tensity of background traﬃc can be conveniently modeled as
chance nodes in the framework. Third, the level-K reasoning
strategy oﬀers a natural way for modeling the sophistication
levels in strategic reasoning by both the attacker and the
defender. A na¨ıve attacker, for example, would think there
is no defense at level 0, but a more sophisticated attacker
would take the defender’s potential defense into considera-
tion with higher k in reasoning.
In the following sections, we shall describe our framework
which applies the semi network-form game model to evaluate
DDoS attacks and defense. We will ﬁrst introduce a number
of random variables to describe system states in Section 4,
and in the ensuing section, we will explain how to use a
Bayesian network to model dependencies among these sys-
tem variables. In Section 6, we will discuss how each player
uses this Bayesian network to reason about the adversary’s
move and accordingly derive her best response action.
4. SYSTEM VARIABLES
In this section, we present the random variables that are
used to model the system state. Table 1 summarizes all the
variables introduced to describe the system state. These
variables fall into three groups. The ﬁrst group describes the
network state, such as how much traﬃc arrives at the exter-
nal link and how much traﬃc is served by the server. Since
