**Abstract:**
A recently introduced cellular network-based One-Tap Authentication (OTAuth) scheme allows app users to quickly sign up or log in to their accounts using tokens provided by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) instead of traditional passwords. However, our in-depth security analysis has revealed several fundamental design flaws in popular OTAuth services. These flaws enable an adversary to:
1. Perform unauthorized login and register new accounts as the victim.
2. Illegally obtain identities of victims.
3. Interfere with OTAuth services of legitimate apps.

To evaluate the impact of these issues, we developed a pipeline that integrates both static and dynamic analysis. We examined 1,025 Android and 894 iOS apps, each with over 100 million installations, and confirmed that 396 Android and 398 iOS apps are affected. Our research systematically reveals the threats against OTAuth services and provides suggestions for mitigating these threats.

## I. Introduction
Password-less authentication simplifies user experiences, especially for smartphone users who often struggle with remembering and inputting different passwords for various mobile apps. Recently, a new type of authentication scheme, cellular network-based One-Tap Authentication (OTAuth), has gained popularity. This scheme allows users to log in to an account with just one tap on the screen. When a user launches an app with OTAuth enabled, it automatically communicates with the MNO managing the cellular network and distributing the SIM card. The phone must use the cellular network, not Wi-Fi, during this process. The app then prompts the user to click the "Login" button to complete the authentication.

As a representative instance of Mobile Connect, a universal digital identity service proposed by the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), OTAuth is being adopted globally. Compared to traditional schemes like password-based or SMS-based authentication, OTAuth significantly simplifies the login process by reducing more than 15 screen touches and 20 seconds of operation each time. More importantly, it liberates users from creating and remembering multiple login credentials. However, this convenience also makes it easier for attackers to circumvent user authentication. Despite recent studies on other login security issues, there is a lack of research specifically targeting OTAuth. Therefore, a comprehensive security analysis of OTAuth mechanisms is necessary.

## II. Background
### A. One-Tap Authentication (OTAuth) Scheme
One-Tap Authentication is a third-party-based authentication scheme supported by Mobile Network Operators, similar to Single-Sign-On. For an app that integrates this service, the user can log in to their account with the local phone number of the device with just one click. The local phone number refers to the number bound to the SIM card on the mobile device. As one of the login options, the app displays the masked local phone number. The user can opt to log in this way without typing any credentials, or choose other login methods, such as Single-Sign-On with Google or Facebook. If the local phone number is not associated with any account, the app will typically create a new account and bind it to the local phone number. Compared to other authentication schemes like Single-Sign-On or SMS One-Time-Password (OTP), OTAuth provides a more streamlined and user-friendly experience.

**Contributions:**
- We uncovered several design and implementation flaws in the OTAuth scheme, which is widely used and highly popular among real-world apps.
- Exploiting these flaws, we designed several attacks where an adversary can fully bypass the authentication and perform malicious actions.
- We performed a large-scale measurement to evaluate the impact of these threats, proposing a pipeline that integrates both static and dynamic approaches for detecting potential affected apps. Our results showed that a significant portion of highly popular apps are vulnerable (38.6% for Android and 44.5% for iOS).
- We discussed feasible modifications to enhance the security of the OTAuth scheme.

**Ethical Considerations:**
The SIMULATION attack experiments were conducted using phone numbers and app accounts of the authors, ensuring no impact on other users. We informed the affected MNOs through CNCERT/CC, the authority for vulnerability coordination in mainland China. Solutions to fix related issues were provided, and vulnerabilities were documented under CNVD-2022-04497, CNVD-2022-04499, and CNVD-2022-05690, all rated as high severity (scoring 8.3 out of 10 in CVSS 2.0).
