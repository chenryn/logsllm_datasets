User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Does nginx have dynamic includes? Is there any way to include a config file that gets reloaded on each request (maybe only when is modified)?

Something like:

server {
    ...
    dynamic_include $document_root/.nginx;
}


This could make people able to reproduce in a efficient way .htaccess found in Apache as it is opt-in and wouldn't stat() every folder out there...

Assistant: Normal configuration files are read only once (during startup and when requested externaly), but you can use the HttpLuaModule to have a piece of Lua script to be evaluated at each request. Nginx provides 4 request phases (rewrite, access, content, log) in which Lua scripts can be executed.

Here are some thing you can do with Lua (from manual):


  
  Mashup'ing and processing outputs of various nginx upstream outputs    (proxy, drizzle, postgres, redis, memcached, and etc) in Lua,
  doing arbitrarily complex access control and security checks in Lua before requests actually reach the upstream backends,
  manipulating response headers in an arbitrary way (by Lua)
  fetching backend information from external storage backends (like redis, memcached, mysql, postgresql) and use that information to choose which upstream backend to access on-the-fly,
  coding up arbitrarily complex web applications in a content handler using synchronous but still non-blocking access to the database backends and other storage,
  doing very complex URL dispatch in Lua at rewrite phase,
  using Lua to implement advanced caching mechanism for Nginx's subrequests and arbitrary locations.
