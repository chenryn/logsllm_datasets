ABSTRACT
The idea of using one’s behavior with a pointing device, such
as a mouse or a touchpad, as a behavioral biometric for au-
thentication purposes has gained increasing attention over
the past decade. A number of interesting approaches based
on the idea have emerged in the literature and promising
experimental results have been reported; however, we argue
that limitations in the past experimental evaluations of these
approaches raise questions about their true e(cid:11)ectiveness in a
practical setting. In this paper, we review existing authenti-
cation approaches based on mouse dynamics and shed light
on some important limitations regarding how the e(cid:11)ective-
ness of these approaches has been evaluated in the past. We
present the results of several experiments that we conducted
to illustrate our observations and suggest guidelines for e-
valuating future authentication approaches based on mouse
dynamics. We also discuss a number of avenues for addi-
tional research that we believe are necessary to advance the
state of the art in this area.

INTRODUCTION
Mouse dynamics describe an individual’s behavior with a
computer-based pointing device, such as a mouse or a touch-
pad. Recently, mouse dynamics have been proposed as a be-
havioral biometric, under the premise that mouse behavior
is relatively unique among di(cid:11)erent people. Mouse dynamics

are not the only behavioral biometric to be proposed that
is based on one’s behavior with a human computer inter-
action (HCI) device. Keystroke dynamics, which measure
an individual’s unique typing rhythms, have been the sub-
ject of considerable research over the past few decades and
their use for authentication has shown promising results [9].
Given that much of the interaction between humans and
computers these days involves the use of a pointing device,
using mouse dynamics for authentication was an obvious
next step.
In the context of authentication, biometrics have several
advantages over traditional authentication techniques that
verify identity based on something one knows (e.g. a pass-
word) or something one has (e.g. a hardware token). In par-
ticular, biometrics cannot be forgotten, stolen, or misplaced.
Additionally, HCI-based behavioral biometrics have the ad-
vantage that they are less obtrusive than other biometrics
and do not require special hardware in order to capture the
necessary biometric data.
While authentication with keystroke dynamics has been
studied extensively over the past three decades, mouse dy-
namics has just recently begun to gain interest over the last
decade. In general, mouse dynamics seems to hold promise
as an authentication technique, with some recently proposed
approaches ([2], [5]) reporting error rates better or compa-
rable to other well-established biometrics such as voice and
face recognition. However, we believe that this may be an
overly optimistic assessment of the state of the art due to
limitations in the experimental evaluations that have ap-
peared in the literature. More speci(cid:12)cally, we have observed
that many of the existing approaches require an impractical
amount of mouse data to be collected before an authenti-
cation decision can be made with reasonable accuracy. We
have also observed that in many of the past evaluations, en-
vironmental variables that could potentially in(cid:13)uence mouse
dynamics were not properly controlled from one test sub-
ject to the next. As a consequence, it is unclear whether
the results of those evaluations actually re(cid:13)ect detectable
di(cid:11)erences in mouse behavior among test subjects, or dif-
ferences among their computing environments. To illustrate
and explore these observations, we collected data from a
group of volunteer subjects under tightly controlled condi-
tions and performed several experiments on this data us-
ing implementations of two representative mouse dynamics
techniques from the literature. Additionally, we performed
experiments to test the feasibility of utilizing mouse dynam-
ics for authentication in remote access scenarios, such as
web-based applications. In contrast to the local access sce-
476
nario, it is common for a user to remotely access the same
application from di(cid:11)erent computers, which may impact au-
thentication accuracy.
Speci(cid:12)cally, we make the following contributions in this
paper:
1. We review existing authentication approaches based
on mouse dynamics and identify several pitfalls in the
experimental methodology used to evaluate these tech-
niques. For instance, we show that environmental vari-
ables (including pointing device type) were not proper-
ly controlled across test subjects in some evaluations,
which can signi(cid:12)cantly impact results. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the (cid:12)rst work to call attention
to these important limitations.
2. To quantitatively examine the impact of environmen-
tal variables on existing schemes, we designed rigorous
experiments to evaluate these approaches when envi-
ronmental variables are tightly controlled across sub-
jects. We also tested existing approaches under di(cid:11)er-
ent access scenarios. In a nutshell, our results showed
that (a) higher error rates are observed when variables
are tightly controlled, and (b) existing approaches are
unlikely to be e(cid:11)ective under certain common remote
access scenarios.
3. Based on insight gained from our experimental results
we argue that, while promising, mouse dynamics based
authentication is not yet suitable for practical deploy-
ment. We also discuss a number of avenues for im-
portant future work to improve the viability of this
technique.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the
next section, we provide some general background informa-
tion on mouse dynamics authentication systems. In Section
3, we present an overview of existing techniques from the
literature, followed by a discussion of the shortcomings of
past experimental evaluations in Section 4.
In Sections 5
and 6, we present and discuss our experiments. Finally, we
o(cid:11)er a discussion of several important avenues for additional
work in Section 7, and then conclude the paper with some
(cid:12)nal remarks in Section 8.
2. BACKGROUND
In this section we provide a general overview of mouse dy-
namics authentication (henceforth abbreviated MDA) sys-
tems.
2.1 Enrollment and Veriﬁcation
Like all biometric authentication systems, MDA systems
involve an enrollment phase and a veri(cid:12)cation phase. Before
the system can be used for the (cid:12)rst time, one is required to
enroll, by providing the system with a sample of one’s typi-
cal mouse behavior, which is stored for use during veri(cid:12)ca-
tion. We use the term enrollment signature to denote this
stored behavioral data. During veri(cid:12)cation, the active user’s
mouse activity is captured and compared to the enrollment
signature.
MDA systems can be classi(cid:12)ed according to their mode
of veri(cid:12)cation. Static approaches collect and verify a user’s
mouse data at speci(cid:12)c times (e.g. at login time), while con-
tinuous approaches collect and verify the user’s mouse data
repeatedly throughout the entire session.
2.2 Acquisition and Feature Extraction
Mouse data is captured from the user by a software pro-
gram that intercepts the low-level mouse events generated
by the pointing device, including raw movement, button up
and button down events. Associated with each event may
be several attributes, including: a timestamp, cursor coor-
dinates and event type. Since raw mouse events are typi-
cally too low-level to be useful for behavioral analysis they
are usually aggregated and converted into higher-level ab-
stractions (e.g. point-and-clicks, drag-and-drops, etc.
[2])
from which meaningful behavioral patterns can be detect-
ed. From the high-level abstractions, various statistical and
kinematic features can be extracted and used for behavioral
comparison.
2.3 Behavioral Comparison
Behavioral patterns are detected from a stream of mouse
events at the feature level. Various algorithms have been
used in the literature to detect and compare behavioral pat-
terns. These range from simple distance metrics to complex
machine learning algorithms like neural networks.
2.4 Evaluation Metrics
Like other biometric authentication systems, those based
on mouse dynamics are typically evaluated with respect to
the following metrics:
• False Acceptance Rate (FAR){the probability that the
system will incorrectly label the active user as the same
user that produced the enrollment signature.
• False Rejection Rate (FRR){the probability that the
system will incorrectly label the active user as an im-
postor, when in fact it is not.
• Equal Error Rate (EER){the error rate when the sys-
tem’s parameters (such as the decision threshold) are
set such that the FRR and FAR are equal. The lower
the EER the more accurate the system.
• Veri(cid:12)cation time{the time required by the system to
collect su(cid:14)cient behavioral data to make an authenti-
cation decision.
3. EXISTING APPROACHES
In this section we provide a brief survey of MDA approach-
es proposed over the past decade. In the course of our liter-
ature review, we observed some recurring problems among
the existing techniques, primarily regarding how they were
evaluated.
In the survey, we merely note these problem-
s as we discuss each technique and defer a more thorough
discussion of the problems to Section 4.
3.1 Continuous Veriﬁcation Approaches
A number of MDA approaches for continuous authen-

proach by Ahmed and Traore, low-level mouse events are
aggregated as higher-level actions such as point-and-clicks or
drag-and-drops, characterized by action type, distance, du-
ration and direction [1], [2]. Consecutive actions over some
time frame are grouped into sessions, over which 39 mouse
dynamics-related features are computed. Authentication in-
volves training a neural network on mouse data from a giv-
en user, which can then be used to classify observed mouse
477
behavior at authentication time. An authentication experi-
ment on mouse data collected from the personal computers
of 22 users achieved an average EER of around 2.46%. The
data sessions used in the experiment were around 17 min-
utes in length1, implying a veri(cid:12)cation time of at least 17
minutes. An additional experiment with 7 users, all using
the same computer and mouse for data collection resulted in
an FRR of 6.25% and an FAR of 1.25%; however, the data
sessions in this experiment were 30 minutes in length{nearly
twice the length of the sessions in the main experiment.
Pusara and Brodley presented an approach in which raw
mouse data is preprocessed and grouped into data points,
each corresponding to a summary of mouse events over a
window of con(cid:12)gurable size [10]. Features such as frequen-
cy, angle, distance and speed are extracted for each window.
Parameters for the technique were chosen on a per-user basis
using a validation set and the C5.0 decision tree algorithm
[11] was used for classi(cid:12)cation. Using data from 11 user-
s, collected on their own personal computers, the technique
achieved an average FAR of 0.43% and an average FRR of
1.75% in an authentication experiment. Since parameter-
s were chosen independently for each user, detection time
varied by user, ranging from one minute to 14.5 minutes
depending on the user.
Gamboa and Fred introduced a continuous authentication
approach that aggregates raw mouse events into strokes{
the movement events occurring between two clicks [4], [5].
Each stroke is characterized by 63 spatial, temporal and s-
tatistical features, though this feature space is reduced to
the best subset of features, for each user through a greedy
feature selection process. According to the paper, feature
selection was performed on the same test data used to e-
valuate the approach; we remark that using test data for
feature selection is known to bias the training model toward
the test data, resulting in an overly optimistic estimate of
a classi(cid:12)er’s performance [7]. A statistical model employing
the Weibull distribution as the parametric model was used
for classi(cid:12)cation and authentication decisions were based on
the average classi(cid:12)cation outcome of a sequence of individ-
ual strokes. The detection time was therefore dependent
on the sequence length used. Experiments on data from 50
users, trying various sequence lengths found that sequences
of 50 strokes (equivalent to about 50 seconds of mouse da-
ta) yielded an EER of 2%. The paper did not explicitly
state whether subjects used di(cid:11)erent computers during the
experiment.
Schulz presented a continuous authentication approach in
which the mouse event stream is segmented into curves,
characterized by length, curvature and in(cid:13)ection-based fea-
tures [14]. An enrollee’s behavioral signature is formed by
computing histograms from the curve characteristics of mul-
tiple curves. Veri(cid:12)cation is accomplished by computing the
Euclidean distance between a user’s enrollment signature
and the mouse activity observed during veri(cid:12)cation. An e-
valuation of the system on mouse data from 72 anonymous
users running mouse recording software on their personal
