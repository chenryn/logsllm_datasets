              %CPU  
                     Total percentage of CPU time used by the task. In an SMP environment, the task’s CPU usage will be divided by the total number of CPU’s if option -I has been entered on the command line.  
              CPU  
                     Processor number to which the task is attached.  
              Command  
                     The command name of the task.  
              When reporting global statistics for tasks and all their children, the following values are displayed:  
              PID  
                     The identification number of the task which is being monitored together with its children.  
              usr-ms  
                     Total  number  of milliseconds spent by the task and all its children while executing at the user level (application), with or without nice priority, and collected during the interval of time.  
                     Note that this field does NOT include time spent running a virtual processor.  
              system-ms  
                     Total number of milliseconds spent by the task and all its children while executing at the system level (kernel), and collected during the interval of time.  
              guest-ms  
                     Total number of milliseconds spent by the task and all its children in virtual machine (running a virtual processor).  
              Command  
                     The command name of the task which is being monitored together with its children.  
       -V     Print version number then exit.  
       -w     Report task switching activity (kernels 2.6.23 and later only).  The following values are displayed:  
              PID  
                     The identification number of the task being monitored.  
              cswch/s  
                     Total number of voluntary context switches the task made per second.  A voluntary context switch occurs when a task blocks because it requires a resource that is unavailable.  
              nvcswch/s  
                     Total number of non voluntary context switches the task made per second.  A involuntary context switch takes place when a task executes for the duration of its time slice and then is forced to  
                     relinquish the processor.  
              Command  
                     The command name of the task.  
ENVIRONMENT  
       The pidstat command takes into account the following environment variable:  
       S_TIME_FORMAT  
              If  this  variable  exists  and  its  value  is ISO then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report header.  The pidstat command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)  
              instead.  
EXAMPLES  
       pidstat 2 5  
              Display five reports of CPU statistics for every active task in the system at two second intervals.  
       pidstat -r -p 1643 2 5  
              Display five reports of page faults and memory statistics for PID 1643 at two second intervals.  
       pidstat -T CHILD -r 2 5  
              Display five reports of page faults statistics at two second intervals for the child processes of all tasks in the system. Only child processes with non-zero statistics values are displayed.  
BUGS  
       /proc filesystem must be mounted for the pidstat command to work.  
FILES  
       /proc contains various files with system statistics.
