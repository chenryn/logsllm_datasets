User: I'd like to place a special file in the /usr/bin folder of Ubuntu. Basically I'm trying to write a setup file in python which would do the job.
But administrative privileges are needed to fulfill the job, how to provide my setup with these privileges (provided that I have the password and can use it in my program)?
Assistant: You need to run the program with escalated privileges. Under Ubuntu, this is normally done with the sudo command, which will prompt the user for their password.
