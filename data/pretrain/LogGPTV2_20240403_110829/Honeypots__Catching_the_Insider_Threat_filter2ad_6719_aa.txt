technologies,  primarily 
In  the  past  several  years  there  has  been  extensive 
research 
for 
detection  and  information  gathering  against  external 
threats.  However, little research has been done for one of 
the  most  dangerous  threats,  the  advance  insider,  the 
trusted  individual who knows your internal organization.  
These  individuals  are  not  after  your  systems,  they  are 
after  your  information.    This  presentation  discusses  how 
honeypot technologies can be used to detect, identify, and 
gather information on these specific threats. 
1. 
Introduction 
Honeypots  are  a  powerful,  new  technology  with 
incredible  potential.    They  can  do  everything  from 
detecting  new  attacks  never  seen  in  the  wild  before,  to 
tracking automated credit card fraud and identity theft.  In 
the past several years we have seen the technology rapidly 
develop,  with  new  concepts  such  as  honeypot  farms, 
commercial  and  open  source  solutions,  and  documented 
findings  released.   However, a  great deal  of  research has 
been  focused  on  identifying,  capturing,  and  researching 
external  threats.    While  malicious  and  dangerous,  these 
attacks are often random with attackers more interested in 
how  many  systems  they  can  break  into  then  which 
systems  they  break  into.    To  date,  limited  research  has 
been  done  on  how  honeypots  can  apply  to  a  far  more 
dangerous  and  devastating  threat,  the  advanced  insider.  
This 
individual  knows  your  networks  and 
organization.    Often,  these  individuals  are  not  after 
computers,  but  specific  information.    This  is  a  risk  that 
has  proven  far  more  dangerous,  and  far  more  difficult  to 
mitigate.

This  paper  attempts  to  discuss  how  honeypots,  an 
emerging  technology,  can  apply  to  this  threat.    The 
strategy  and  tactics  of  how  honeypots  are  used  against 
insider  threats,  especially  advanced  insider  threats,  are 
vastly different then those of an external threat.  We will 
address some of the new ways that they can apply to the 
insider.  Many of the ideas discussed here are the result of 
the ARDA Cyber Indications and Warning Workshop, led 
by  the  NRRC1  hosted  at  MITRE.    This  paper  does  not 
cover  proven  solutions.    Instead  it  introduces  novel 
applications of a developing technology.  It is hoped this 
paper promotes discussion and research into new fields. 
2.  Honeypots 
A  honeypot  is  a  unique  security  resource.    It  is 
something  you  want  the  bad  guys  to  interact  with.    The 
definition  of  a  honeypot  as,  defined  by  the  honeypot 
maillist2,  a  public  forum  of  over  5,000  security 
professionals, is: 
A honeypot is an information system resource whose 
value lies in unauthorized or illicit use of that resource. 
What  this  definition  means  is  honeypots  derive  their 
value  from  threats  using  them.    If  the  enemy  does  not 
interact or use the honeypot, then it has little value.  This 
is  very  different  from  most  security  mechanisms.    For 
example,  the  last  thing  you  want  an  attacker  to  do  is 
interact with your firewall, IDS sensor, or PKI certificate 
authority.    Honeypots  are  very  different,  and  it  is  this 
difference  that  makes  them  such  a  powerful  tool  in  your 
arsenal.
First,  honeypots  do  not  solve  a  specific  problem.  
Instead,  they  are  a  highly  flexible  tool  that  has  many 
applications  to  security.    They  can  be  used  everything 
from  slowing  down  or  stopping    automated  attacks, 
capturing  new  exploits  to  gathering  intelligence  on 
emerging  threats  or    early  warning  and  prediction.  
Second,  honeypots  come  in  many  different  shapes  and 
sizes.  They can be everything from a Windows program 
that  emulates  common  services,  such  as  the  Windows 
honeypot KFSensor3, to entire networks of real computers 
to  be  attacked,  such  as  Honeynets.    In  fact,  as  we  will 
discuss later, honeypots don’t even have to be a computer, 
instead  they  can  be  a  credit  card  number,  Excel  spread

All honeypots share the concept; they are a resource or

unauthorized  or  malicious  activity.    For  example,  a 
honeypot  could  be  nothing  more  then  a  webserver 
deployed  in  your  DMZ  network.    The  webserver  is  not 
used  for  production  purposes,  its  does  not  even  have  an 
entry  in  DNS,  its  merely  physically  located  with  other 
webservers.    Any  interaction  with  the  honeypot  is 
assumed  unauthorized  and  most  likely  malicious.    If  the 
webserver  honeypot  is  probed  by  external  systems  from 
the  Internet,  you  have  identified  a  probe  or  attack,  most 
likely the same one your other production webservers are 
facing.    If  your  honeypot  is  probed  by  one  of  the 
production  webservers  on  the  DMZ,  that  can  imply  that 
the  production  webserver  has  been  compromised  by  an 
attacker,  and  is  now  being  used  as  a  launching  pad  to 
compromise other systems on the DMZ.  Its is because of 
this  very  simple  concept  that  honeypots  share  immense 
advantages, including

technologies  which  rely  upon  known  signatures  or 
upon  statistical  detection.    Signature-based  security 
technologies  by  definition  imply  that  “someone  is 
going to get hurt” before the new attack is discovered 
and  a  signature  is  distributed.    Statistical  detection 
also suffers from probabilistic failures – there is some 
non-zero  probability  that  a  new  kind  of  attack  is 
going to go undetected.  Honeypots on the other hand 
can  easily  identify  and  capture  new  attacks  against 
them.  Any activity with the honeypot is an anomaly, 
making new or unseen attacks easily stand out. 
(cid:120)(cid:3) Encryption:    It  does  not  matter  if  an  attack  or 
malicious  activity  is  encrypted,  the  honeypot  will 
capture the activity.  As more and more organizations 
adopt  encryption  within  their  environments  (such  as 
SSH,  IPsec,  and  SSL)  this  becomes  a  major  issue.  
Honeypots  can  do  this  because  the  encrypted  probes

IPv6:    Honeypots  work  in  any  IP  environment, 
regardless of the IP protocol, including IPv6.  IPv6 is 
the new IP standard that many organizations, such as 
the Department of Defense, and many countries, such 
as  Japan,  are  actively  adopting.    Many  current 
technologies, such as firewalls or IDS sensors, cannot 
handle IPv6.

resources, even on the largest of networks.  A simple,

For  insider  threats,  we  will  be  leveraging  these 
advantages.    However,  like  all  technologies,  honeypots 
share several disadvantages.  We have to understand these 
disadvantages to catch our insider. 
(cid:120)(cid:3) Risk:  Honeypots are a security resource you want the 
bad  guys  to  interact  with,  there  is  a  risk  that  an 
attacker could use a honeypot to attack or harm other 
non-honeypot systems.  This risk varies with the type 
of  honeypot  used.    For  example,  simple  honeypots 
such as KFSensor have very little risk.  Honeynets, a 
more complex solution, have a great deal of risk. 
(cid:120)(cid:3) Limited  Field  of  View:    Honeypots  only  see  or 
capture that which interacts with them.  They are not 
a  passive  device  that  captures  activity  to  all  other 
systems.  Instead, they only have value when directly 
interacted  with.    In  many  ways  honeypots  are  like  a 
microscope.  They have a limited field of view, but a 
field  of  view  that  gives  them  great  detail  of 
information.

There  are  two key  types of  honeypots  that play  a  role 
in  indicating  and  capturing  an  advanced  insider  threat, 
Honeynets and honeytokens.  We will now take a moment 
and discuss these two specific types of honeypots. 
2.1  Honeynets 
threats,  both 
Honeynets are one of the most advanced and complex 
honeypots, their primary purposes is to capture extensive 
information  on 
internal  and  external.  
Honeynets are complex in that they are entire networks of 
computers  to  be  attacked.    Nothing  is  emulated.    The 
systems  and  applications  within  a  Honeynet  can  be  the 
same  systems  found  in  your  organization.    Within  these 
systems  you  can  place  additional  information,  such  as 
files,  records  in  databases,  log  entries,  any  information 
you  want  the  attacker  to  interact  with.    Honeynets  have 
this  flexibility  because  they  are  not  a  standardized 
solution,  instead  a  Honeynet  is  a  specialized  architecture 
that  creates  a  fishbowl,  you  can  then  place  any  targets 
systems  you  want  within  this  fishbowl.    Just  like  a 
fishbowl, you can create your own virtual world; however 
instead of adding coral and sand, you add Solaris database 
servers  or  Cisco  routers.    Just  like  a  fishbowl,  you  can 
watch  everything  that  is  going  on,  however  with  a 
Honeynet;  the  attacker  never  realizes  you  are  watching
