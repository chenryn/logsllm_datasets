### Abstract
Markovian Arrival Processes (MAPs) are a tractable class of point processes used to model correlated time series, such as those found in network traces and system logs, which are often used in performance analysis and reliability evaluation. Marked MAPs (MMAPs) generalize MAPs by allowing the modeling of multi-class arrivals with cross-correlations between classes.

In this paper, we present analytical formulas to fit second-order acyclic MMAPs with an arbitrary number of classes. We initially derive closed-form formulas to fit second-order MMAPs with two classes, where the underlying MAP is in canonical form. Our approach leverages forward and backward moments, which have been recently defined but never jointly exploited for fitting. We then show how to sequentially apply these formulas to fit an arbitrary number of classes. Representative storage traces and trace-driven simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

## 1. Introduction
Marked Markovian Arrival Processes (MMAPs) have gained attention as a promising tool for performance analysis and reliability evaluation, particularly for modeling multi-class workloads [1], [2]. An MMAP generalizes a Markovian Arrival Process (MAP) by marking arrivals with a class label, enabling the description of non-Poisson, dependent, and multi-class flows. Compared to other point processes, MMAPs offer the ability to describe cross-correlated multi-class arrivals using continuous-time Markov chains.

However, fitting methods for MMAPs are still in their early stages, and more work is needed to fully exploit the expressive power of marked processes. In this work, we develop novel analytical formulas to fit second-order acyclic MMAPs with an arbitrary number of classes. Our approach first fits the first-order multi-class moments and then matches the underlying MAP, impacting the degrees of freedom in a limited manner. This method is not only tractable but also effective, as demonstrated through representative storage traces and trace-driven simulations.

## 2. Background and Notation
We consider an interval-stationary marked arrival sequence \((X_i, C_i)\), where \(X_i \in \mathbb{R}_+\) is the inter-arrival time between the \((i-1)\)-th and \(i\)-th arrivals, and each arrival is marked with a class label \(C_i \in \{1, \ldots, m\}\).

### A. Multi-Class Moments
For marked point processes, several types of moments can be defined. We follow the approach by Buchholz et al. [4] and define the forward moments as:
\[ F_{j,c} = \mathbb{E}[X_i \mid C_{i-1} = c] \]
These moments capture the expected inter-arrival times given the previous class.

### B. Marked Markovian Arrival Process (MMAP)
An MMAP of order \(n\) with \(m\) classes, denoted as MMAP[m] of order \(n\), can be seen as a hidden-Markov process that generates the marked arrival sequence \((X_i, C_i)\). An MMAP[m] of order \(n\) is specified by a set of \(n \times n\) matrices \((D_0, D_{1,1}, D_{1,2}, \ldots, D_{1,m})\), where \(D_0\) is the sub-generator matrix of the underlying PH (phase-type distribution) of order \(n\), and \(D_{1,c} = (-D_0)P_c\), with \(P_c\) being a sub-stochastic matrix representing the probability of transitioning to class \(c\).

The moment matching problem for an MMAP[m] of order \(n\) involves finding an MMAP such that the moments of \((X_i, C_i)\) match the empirical moments computed from a sufficient number of samples. The degrees of freedom for fitting an MMAP[m] of order \(n\) are at most \(mn^2\). For example, a second-order MMAP[2] has at most eight degrees of freedom.

## 3. Properties and Definitions
We provide the necessary definitions and properties for the fitting methodology. Specifically, we examine the multi-class moments and the representation of MMAPs.

## 4. Fitting Methodology for Two Classes
We derive closed-form formulas to fit second-order MMAPs with two classes, where the underlying MAP is in canonical form. Our approach leverages forward and backward moments, which have been recently defined but never jointly exploited for fitting.

## 5. Sequential Fitting for Arbitrary Number of Classes
We extend our fitting methodology to handle an arbitrary number of classes. The classes are fitted one after the other, ensuring that the resulting MMAP parameters are consistent and accurate. This sequential approach is both tractable and effective, as demonstrated through trace-driven simulations.

## 6. Results
We present results for both random instances and real-world traces. The proposed fitting method is shown to yield accurate results, even when the dataset is not drawn from a second-order MMAP. The effectiveness of our approach is further illustrated through representative storage traces and trace-driven simulations.

## 7. Conclusions
This study demonstrates the utility of MMAPs for modeling real systems with cross-correlated workloads, such as storage systems. The proposed fitting methodology is both tractable and effective, providing a promising tool for performance analysis and reliability evaluation. Future work will focus on extending the methodology to higher-order MMAPs and exploring its applications in various domains.
