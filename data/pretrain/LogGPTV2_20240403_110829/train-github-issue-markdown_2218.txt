 **Jon Brisbin** opened **SPR-8201** and commented
The ApplicationEvent dispatcher should take generics information into account
when deciding whether to call a particular `ApplicationListener`. This would
allow the user to register an `ApplicationListener` for their event subclass
like this:
    public class BeforeSaveEvent extends ApplicationEvent {}
    public class MyListener implements ApplicationListener>{}
When a `BeforeSaveEvent` event is dispatched, only those
`ApplicationListener` that have specified `MyDomainObject` in the generics
clause will be dispatched to the configured listener (such as `MyListener`)
