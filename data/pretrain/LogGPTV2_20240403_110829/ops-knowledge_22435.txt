**User:**
Does anyone know how to set the default path or directory for saving Python scripts before running them? On a Mac, the system defaults to saving scripts in the top-level `~/Documents` directory. I would like to specify a different location. Any ideas?

**Assistant:**
To set a custom default directory for saving and opening Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open IDLE:**
   - Launch the Python IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) on your Mac.

2. **Set the Working Directory:**
   - Go to the `File` menu.
   - Select `Open...` to open an existing Python script, or `New File` to create a new one.
   - When you open a file, IDLE sets the current working directory to the folder where the file is located.

3. **Change the Default Save Location:**
   - If you want to change the default save location, navigate to the desired directory using the file browser when you choose to save your script.
   - Once you save a file in the new directory, IDLE will use this as the default directory for subsequent saves until you change it again.

By following these steps, you can easily set and change the default directory for your Python scripts in IDLE.
