User: Does anyone know where or how to set the default path/directory on saving python scripts prior to running?  
On a Mac it wants to save them in the top level ~/Documents directory. I would like to specify a real location. Any ideas?
Assistant: If you open a module, that sets the default working directory.
Start IDLE.
File -> Open to open your file.  And set the current working directory.
