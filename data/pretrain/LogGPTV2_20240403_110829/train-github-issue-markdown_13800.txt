I've been using HoverProvider to quickly display the origin file of a user
function in Lua.  
I'm using the Markdown syntax for creating a clickable link, which opens the
file in the editor:
`[c:\temp\file.lua](file:c:\temp\file.lua)` -> c:\temp\file.lua
I'm wondering if this link syntax also supports line number, and if it does,
what is the syntax of it?
I believe this question is also generally related to all places where an
extension can display text formatted with Markdown.
