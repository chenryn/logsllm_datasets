I am attempting to use the Atom text editor for writing content in Polish. The default and preferred keyboard layout, often referred to as the "programmer's keyboard," utilizes the AltGr (right Alt) key to input Polish-specific characters: ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ó, ś, ż, and ź.

However, I have encountered an issue where pressing AltGr-o, which should produce the character 'ó', is instead interpreted by the Atom editor (or possibly by MS Windows 7 Home Premium) as Ctrl-Alt-o. This key combination is already bound to the "application:add-project-folder" function in Atom. As a result, it becomes difficult to use Atom for creating or editing Polish-language content.
