I am trying to use Atom to edit contents in Polish language. The default and
preferred keyboard bindings, so called "programmers keyboard", uses AltGr
(right Alt) to enter Polish letters: ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ó, ś, ż, ź.
The problem is that the Atom editor (or perhaps MS Windows 7 Home Pro)
represents AltGr-o, which is used to enter 'ó' character, as Ctrl-Alt-o...
which keybinding is taken by Atom as application:add-project-folder. This
makes it hard to use Atom for content in Polish language...
