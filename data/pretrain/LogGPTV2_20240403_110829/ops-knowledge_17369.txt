Assistant: What is Webalizer:  (for those wondering)

Webalizer is a fast, free web server log file analysis program, written in C, which produces highly detailed, easily configurable usage reports in HTML format.  It was written to solve several problems with currently available analysis packages.

Webalizer Features:


It is written in C to be extremely
fast and highly portable. On a 200
MHz Pentium machine, over 10,000
records can be processed in one
second, with a 40 Megabyte file
taking roughly 15 seconds (over
150,000 records).
Supports standard Common log file
Format server logs. In addition,
several variations of the combined
log file Format are supported,
allowing statistics to be generated
for referring sites and browser types
as well. Now also has native support
for wu-ftpd xferlog FTP and squid log
formats as well.
Generated reports can be configured
from the command line, or by use of
one or more configuration files.
Detailed information on configuration
options can be found in the README
file, supplied with all
distributions.
Supports multiple languages.
Currently, Catalan, Chinese
(traditional and simplified),
Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch,
English, Estonian, Finnish, French,
Galician, German, Greek, Hungarian,
Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian,
Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Malay,
Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese
(Portugal and Brazil), Romanian,
Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene,
Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and
Ukrainian are available.
Unlimited log file sizes and partial
logs are supported, allowing logs to
be rotated as often as needed, and
eliminating the need to keep huge
monthly files on the system.
Distributed under the GNU General
Public License, complete source code
is available as well as binary
distributions for some of the more
popular platforms

Installing through sourcecode


First we need to download the webalizer sourcode first:

wget ftp://ftp.mrunix.net/pub/webalizer/webalizer-2.23-03-src.tgz
Now lets uncompress it

tar zxvf webalizer*
Makesure you have gcc compiler and Gd library installed, you can installed it using yum

yum install gcc gcc-c++ gd-devel
Now go into the webalizer* directory , compile and install it

cd webalizer*
 ./configure
 make
 make install


It is installed and you can checked the version now

webalizer --version
Webalizer V2.23-03 ********other stuff shows here***** 


WEBALIZER CONFIGURATION (single domain)


Create a central directory for the webalizer configuration files

mkdir /etc/webalizer
Create two webalizer configuration files, a.example.conf from the
sample file and put it into /etc/webalizer directory. You need to locate the webalizer.conf.sample files and copy it to /etc/webalizer directory

cp /usr/local/etc/webalizer.conf.sample  /etc/webalizer/a.example.com.conf
Modify LogFile, OutputDir and HostName of the  webalizer config files. For example, fora.example.com.conf

vi /etc/webalizer/a.example.com.conf


and changes the content

LogFile /var/log/httpd/access_log
into
LogFile /var/log/httpd/access_log_1  # it depend on your httpd access_log you can search it on /var/log/httpd/ directory 
OutputDir /var/www/usage/a
into
OutputDir  /home/praetorian-id.org/public_html/webalizer  # it depend on your apache virtual directory that you set on httpd.conf (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf)
HostName       localhost
into
HostName       yourhostname.org  # it depend on your web hostname


Note:You may want to specify other settings specific to the domain, such as HideReferrer,HideSite, etc.


To process all the virtual sites, run the following command:

for i in /etc/webalizer/*.conf; do webalizer -c $i; done


Now you can see the webalizer files on your site, example :

How to set Webalizer on multiple virtual domain :

Tha above tutorial are to set the webalizer for singel domain, how about if  you needed to create webalizer for multiple domain ? , you need to makesure that you have create custom log on your every virtual domain setting on httpd.conf it is usually on /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf , here is the eample :

&lt;VirtualHost 34.14.212.39&gt;
    ServerName test.com
    ServerAlias www.test.com
    DocumentRoot "/home/domains/test.com/htdocs"
    CustomLog "/home/domains/test.com/logs/access_log" common
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


as you can see above, we have set the custom log on /home/domains/test.com/logs/access_log , please also make sure you have create the  /home/domains/test.com/logs directory and set  the permission was set for  domains users

-rw-r--r-- 1 domains users 677485 Dec  1 14:45 access_log
then set the log path on your webalizer conf on /etc/webalizer/

# vi /etc/webalizer/test.conf


LogFile         /home/domains/test.com/logs/access_log
then set it per virtual domain that you have :)

and last thing ,  restart the httpd , if you are using rpm

# service httpd restart


You should see the size of the access_logs on /home/domains/test.com/logs/access_log increase , if not checked the permission and webalizer config on /etc/webalizer/test.com.conf

Do not forget to add cron so the webalizer can be udpated automaticly

crontab -e


add 

1 * * * * /root/dowebalizer &gt;&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1


i will set the crontab every 1 hour to execute the shell script on /root/dowebalizer

Now create the shell script on /root/dowebalizer

vi /root/dowebalizer


enter the following:

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;

my @files = &lt;/etc/webalizer/*.conf&gt;;

foreach my $file (@files) {
        chomp($file);
        system("/usr/local/bin/webalizer -c $file");
}


hit escape and save with w!
