User: How to accelerate the website to shorten page loading time and improve user experience? Please provide a feasible solution.
Assistant: 1. Use CDN network: CDN network (Content Delivery Network) distributes data to each node, so that users can obtain content nearby to improve access efficiency. Static resources (such as JS, CSS, pictures, etc.) can be placed on CDN to speed up page loading. 2. Compress static resources: GZIP compression algorithm can reduce the size of static resources and reduce download time. 3. Use caching technology: Using caching technology can keep the obtained resources in the user's local area and reduce the request time. 4. Optimize pictures: replace large pictures with compressed small pictures, remove unnecessary pictures, etc., to avoid the impact of excessive pictures on loading speed. 5. Avoid using multiple domain names: reduce the use of multiple domain names to request the same resource, and reduce the DNS resolution time. 6. Reduce the size of the cookie file: remove unnecessary information in the cookie, reduce the size of the cookie file, and avoid the impact of the cookie file on the loading speed. 7. Reduce the number of http requests: methods to reduce the number of http requests include merging multiple CSS files and JS files, making multiple images into CSS Sprite (Sprite), etc.
