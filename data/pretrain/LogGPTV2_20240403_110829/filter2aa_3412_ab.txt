# Information Classification: General

## Data Flow Analysis
We need to perform a Data Flow Analysis to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in our code. Below is an example of how to handle Partial Path Traversal.

### Partial Path Traversal - Data Flow
```java
String dirCanonical = dir.getCanonicalPath();
String pCanonical = parent.getCanonicalPath() + File.separatorChar;
if (!dirCanonical.startsWith(pCanonical)) {
    // Handle the case where the directory is not within the expected path
}
```

### Data Flow Analysis
Data Flow Analysis helps uncover hard-to-find vulnerabilities and prevents false positives. Here is an example of a local flow specification for this analysis:

```java
class GetCanonicalPathToStartsWithLocalFlow extends LocalFlowSpec {
    @Override
    public boolean isSource(J.MethodInvocation methodInvocation, Cursor cursor) {
        return new MethodMatcher("java.io.File getCanonicalPath()")
            .matches(methodInvocation);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isSink(Expression expression, Cursor cursor) {
        return InvocationMatcher
            .fromMethodMatcher(new MethodMatcher("java.lang.String startsWith(java.lang.String)"))
            .advanced()
            .isSelect(cursor);
    }
}
```

## Example Case: AWS Java SDK
### CVE-2022-31159
This vulnerability can be mitigated using the data flow analysis techniques described above.

## Vulnerability #3: Zip Slip
Zip Slip is a critical vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary file write operations. Below is an example of how to handle Zip Slip:

### Zip Slip
```java
void zipSlip(File destination, ZipFile zip) {
    Enumeration entries = zip.entries();
    while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
        ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
        File f = new File(destination, e.getName());
        IOUtils.copy(
            zip.getInputStream(e),
            new FileOutputStream(f)
        );
    }
}
```

### Mitigating Zip Slip
To prevent Zip Slip, we need to ensure that the destination file is within the expected directory:

```java
ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
File f = new File(destination, e.getName());
if (!f.toPath().startsWith(destination.toPath())) {
    throw new IOException("Bad Zip Entry!");
}
IOUtils.copy(
    zip.getInputStream(e),
    new FileOutputStream(f)
);
```

### Control Flow Analysis
Control Flow Analysis is crucial for ensuring that the correct checks are in place. Here is an example using OpenRewrite:

```java
File f = new File(destination, e.getName());
if (!f.toPath().startsWith(destination.toPath())) {
    throw new IOException("Bad Zip Entry!");
}
IOUtils.copy(
    zip.getInputStream(e),
    new FileOutputStream(f)
);
```

## Pull Request Generation
### Steps for Generating Pull Requests
1. **Checkout (i.e., Download) Code Repository**
2. **Branch, Apply Diff, & Commit**
3. **Fork Repository on GitHub**
4. **Rename Repository on GitHub**
5. **Push Changes**
6. **Create Pull Request on GitHub**

### File Operations
- **File IO**: Handle file read/write operations.
- **Git Operation**: Perform git commands.
- **GitHub API**: Interact with the GitHub API for repository management.

### Bulk Pull Request Generation Statistics
| Project | PR Generator | Pull Requests | Merge Rate |
|---------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| HTTP Download of Dependencies | Python Bot | 1,596 | 40% |
| CVE-2019-16303: JHipster RNG Vulnerability | Python Bot + Moderne | 3,467 | 2.3% |
| CVE-2020-8597: rhostname array overflow | Python Bot | 1,885 | 7.6% |
| Temporary Directory Hijacking | Moderne | 64 | TBD |
| Partial Path Traversal | Moderne | 24 | TBD |
| Zip Slip | Moderne | 86 | TBD |

### Best Practices for Bulk Pull Request Generation
#### Messaging!
All software problems are people problems in disguise. Effective communication is key.

#### Lesson 1: Sign off all Commits
- Use `--signoff` to sign off on commits.
- Example: `Signed-off-by: Jonathan Leitschuh`
- **Why?** It certifies that you have created the patch or that it was provided under appropriate open-source terms.

#### Lesson 2: Be a Good Commitizen
- GPG Sign your commits to ensure authenticity.

#### Lesson 3: Risks of Using Personal GitHub Account
- Be aware of the risks associated with using your personal GitHub account for bulk pull request generation.

#### Lesson 4: Coordinate with GitHub
- Reach out to GitHub before attempting large-scale pull request generation.
- Contact: PI:EMAIL

#### Lesson 5: Consider the Implications
- Think about the broader implications of your actions on the community and the projects involved.

### Conclusion
As security researchers, we have an obligation to society to identify and fix vulnerabilities. We know these vulnerabilities are out there, and it is our responsibility to address them.
