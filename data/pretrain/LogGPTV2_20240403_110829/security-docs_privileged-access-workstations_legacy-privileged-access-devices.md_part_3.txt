These settings will block unsolicited traffic while still allowing bidirectional communication on connections initiated from the PAW, prevent users with local administrative access from creating local firewall rules that would override the GPO settings and ensure that traffic in and out of the PAW is logged.
      > **Opening up this firewall will expand the attack surface for the PAW and increase security risk. Before adding any addresses, consult the Managing and Operating PAW section in this guidance**.
