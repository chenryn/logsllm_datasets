User: How to configure Nginx reverse proxy on Windows Server?
Assistant: The following are the steps to configure Nginx reverse proxy on Windows Server: 1. Download Nginx, select the Windows version, such as nginx-1.18.0.zip, and extract it to a directory (such as C:\nginx). 2. Open the Nginx configuration file, located at C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf. 3. Configure the upstream server of the reverse proxy. In the http section, add the following code: ``` http { upstream backend { server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; } ... } ``` Among them, backend1.example.com and backend2.example .com is the domain name or IP address of the server you want to proxy. 4. Configure the location of the reverse proxy. In the server section, add the following code: ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } ... } ``` Among them, example.com is the domain name or IP address of the website you want to proxy, and http://backend is the upstream server configured in the previous step. 5. Save the Nginx configuration file and start Nginx: ``` C:\nginx\nginx.exe ``` Nginx reverse proxy has been configured. Access http://example.com in the browser, and you can access the websites on backend1.example.com and backend2.example.com through the Nginx reverse proxy.
