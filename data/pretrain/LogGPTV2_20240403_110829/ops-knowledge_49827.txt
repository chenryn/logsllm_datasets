User: Presently I have a GAE app that does some offline processing (backs up a user's data), and generates a file that's somewhere in the neighbourhood of 10 - 100 MB.  I'm not sure of the best way to serve this file to the user.  The two options I'm considering are:

Adding some code to the offline processing code that 'spoofs' it as a form upload to the blob store, and going thru the normal blobstore process to serve the file.
Having the offline processing code store the file somewhere off of GAE, and serving it from there.

Is there a much better approach I'm overlooking?  I'm guessing this is functionality that isn't well suited to GAE.  I had thought of storing in the datastore as db.Text or Dd.Blob but there I encounter the 1 MB limit.
Any input would be appreciated,
Assistant: I think storing it in the blobstore via a form post is your best currently-available option. We have plans to implement programmatic blobstore writing, but it's not ready quite yet.
