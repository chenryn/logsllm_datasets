I would appreciate the ability to drag windows into designated zones without needing to use the keyboard. However, I also value the flexibility of free window placement and do not want the zoning feature to be constantly active while moving windows.

It would be ideal if users could customize a modifier to enable the zoning feature. For example, using the 5th mouse button as a modifier or enabling a specific mouse action, such as simultaneously pressing the left and right mouse buttons and dragging, to display the zones.
