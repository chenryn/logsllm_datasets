I would love to drag windows to zones without having one hand on the keyboard.
But I also don't want zones enabled always when I move a window, because I
like free placement too.
Wouldn't it be nice when you could set a modifier by yourself? Maybe use your
5th mouse button as a modifier? Or you could also enable something like left +
right mouse down + mouse drag to show zones..
