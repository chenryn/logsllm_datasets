User: I want to be able to schedule an e-mail or more of them to be sent on a specific date, preferably using GAE Mail API if possible (so far I haven't found the solution). 
Would using Cron be an acceptable workaround and if so, would I even be able to create a Cron task with Python? The dates are various with no specific pattern so I can't use the same task over and over again.
Any suggestions how to solve this problem? All help appreciated
Assistant: You can easily accomplish what you need with Task API. When you create a task, you can set an ETA parameter (when to execute). ETA time can be up to 30 days into the future.
If 30 days is not enough, you can store a "send_email" entity in the Datastore, and set one of the properties to the date/time when this email should be sent. Then you create a cron job that runs once a month (week). This cron job will retrieve all "send_email" entities that need to be send the next month (week), and create tasks for them, setting ETA to the exact date/time when they should be executed.
