that the true loss rate is usually within these bounds. We also see
that SLAM tracks the loss rate over time quite well, with its esti-
mated mean closely following the true loss mean.
7. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We believe that SLAM represents a signiﬁcant step forward for
SLA compliance monitoring using active measurements. However,
there are a number of issues that remain. First, there are additional
issues to consider in the network-wide setting. For example, a de-
ployment strategy must be developed to coordinate probe streams
so that links internal to the network are not carrying “too much”
measurement trafﬁc. Another key question is: given a daily (or
based on some other time scale) budget of probes that may be used
to monitor compliance with a SLA, what are the considerations for
optimizing the probe process? Should the probing period be over a

relatively long time scale (e.g., the entire interval of interest), thus
potentially limiting the accuracy of estimates, or should the probing
period be over a shorter time scale, potentially improving estima-
tion accuracy but at the cost of not probing over the entire interval,
thus potentially missing important events? We have assumed in this
paper that perfect accuracy is the goal for compliance monitoring.
However, for some SLAs, a tradeoff (if it is predictable) between
accuracy and measurement overhead may be appropriate. Next,
our examples of distributional inference have focussed on delay.
We plan to more closely examine loss in the future. Finally, while
measuring availability in a simple path-oriented scenario is rather
straightforward, simple application of performance tomography to
infer network-wide availability may not be sufﬁcient in the face of
routing changes.
In summary, this paper introduces a new methodology for SLA
compliance monitoring using active measurements, including new
methods for measuring end-to-end packet loss, mean delay, and de-
lay variation. We propose a new method for obtaining conﬁdence
intervals on the empirical delay distribution. We also describe a
new methodology for inferring lower bounds on the quantiles of
a distribution of a performance metric along a path in a network-
wide setting from a subset of known paths. We implemented these
measurement methods in a tool called SLAM that uniﬁes the var-
ious probe streams resulting in lower overall probe volume. We
evaluated the capabilities of the tool in a controlled laboratory en-
vironment using a range of trafﬁc conditions and in one- and two-

True loss rates are plotted using 10 second intervals. SLAM esti-
mates are plotted using 30 second intervals. Plots shown for long-
lived TCP trafﬁc in the dumbbell topology (top) and self-similar
trafﬁc on route r2 in the star topology (bottom). The upper and
lower bars for SLAM indicate estimates of one standard deviation
above and below the mean using the variance formulation of [37].
hop settings. Our results show that SLAM’s delay and loss rate
estimates are much more accurate than estimates obtained through
standard probe methodologies. Furthermore, we illustrated the con-
vergence and robustness properties of the loss, delay, and delay
variation estimates of SLAM which make it useful in an opera-
tional setting.
