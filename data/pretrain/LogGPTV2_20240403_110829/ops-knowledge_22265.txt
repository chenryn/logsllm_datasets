This can provide users with more convenient, flexible and cost-effective computing services. Cloud computing can be divided into three types according to the level of service provided: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service). Among them, IaaS provides services at the infrastructure level, such as virtual machines, storage, networks, etc.; PaaS provides development environments and tools, allowing enterprises to develop and deploy their own applications in the cloud; SaaS is directly provided to users. Some application software used, such as online document editing, online meeting, etc. In addition, cloud computing can also be divided into private cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud according to the deployment method. Private cloud refers to the private computing resources built by enterprises or individuals on the local or cloud, managed and maintained by dedicated personnel; public cloud is the cloud computing resources open to all users by cloud service providers, multiple users share the same Group computing resources; hybrid cloud is the combination of public cloud and private cloud to meet different business needs, with elasticity and flexibility.
