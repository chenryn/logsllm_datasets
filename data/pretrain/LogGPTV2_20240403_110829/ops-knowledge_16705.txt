User:  company's network operators need to monitor the company's network security status around the clock. Please design a network security monitoring system, including monitoring content, monitoring indicators, and alarm methods.
Assistant: The design of the network security monitoring system is as follows: 1. Monitoring content: the system needs to monitor the company's network security status around the clock, including but not limited to the following: - Network traffic monitoring: monitor the traffic transmitted by the network, and detect abnormal traffic in time; - User behavior monitoring: Monitor user behavior on the network, such as login, file upload and download, etc., and detect abnormal behavior in time; - System security monitoring: monitor the running status of key system services, such as databases, web servers, etc.; - Malicious attack monitoring: monitor all intrusions Log information such as attempts, attacks, viruses, etc.; - Security vulnerability monitoring: monitor system security vulnerabilities, discover and repair vulnerabilities in time. 2. Monitoring indicators: monitoring indicators include the following: - CPU load: monitor whether the CPU usage is normal; - memory usage: monitor whether the memory usage exceeds the preset threshold; - disk space: monitor whether the disk usage exceeds the preset threshold ; - Network traffic: monitor whether the network bandwidth usage reaches the bandwidth limit; - Service status: monitor whether the operation status of key services is normal; - Log information: monitor all log information and find abnormal information in time. 3. Alarm method: The system needs to set up multiple alarm methods, including but not limited to the following methods: - SMS alarm: send the abnormal situation to the designated mobile phone; - Email alarm: send the abnormal situation to the designated mailbox; - Sound Alarm: When an emergency situation is found, a sound alarm will be issued; - Page prompt: The abnormal situation will be directly displayed on the web page, which is convenient for the operator to find and deal with it in time. The above is a basic network security monitoring system design. What needs to be reminded is that the design of this system needs to be flexibly adjusted according to specific business scenarios and risk assessment results to better protect the company's network security.
