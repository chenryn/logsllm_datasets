User: I've noticed that some programs (e.g. hg) allow the user to tab-complete specific parts of the command. For example, if, in an hg repository working directory, I type:
hg qpush --move b8<TAB>
It will try to complete the command with any mercurial patches in my patch queue that start with "b8". 
What I'd like to do is imitate this behavior in my program. That is, I have a series of commands that depend on files within a certain directory, and I'd like to be able to provide tab completion in the shell. Is there an API for providing this on Ubuntu Linux (preferably using python, as that's what my script is written in)?
Assistant: Take a look at the source of the 'cmd' module in the Python library. It supports command completion.
