Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the template extraction:

**Log Line:**
```
NIFF: node node-69 has detected an available network connection on network 10.128.0.0 via interface ee0
```

**Extracted Template:**
```
NIFF: node node-<node_id> has detected an available network connection on network <network_address> via interface <interface_name>
```

**Explanation:**
- `<node_id>`: A placeholder for the unique identifier of the node (e.g., `69`).
- `<network_address>`: A placeholder for the IP address or network range (e.g., `10.128.0.0`).
- `<interface_name>`: A placeholder for the name of the network interface (e.g., `ee0`).

This template clearly identifies the variable components of the log line, making it easier to understand and use for pattern matching or further processing.
