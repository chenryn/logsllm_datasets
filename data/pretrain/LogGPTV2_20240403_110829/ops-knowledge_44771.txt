User: I am thinking about using Google App Engine.It is going to be a huge website. In that case, what is your piece of advice using Google App Engine. I heard GAE has restrictions like we cannot store images or files more than 1MB limit(they are going to change this from what I read in the GAE roadmap),query is limited to 1000 results, and I am also going to se web2py with GAE. So I would like to know your comments. 
Thanks
Assistant: The AppEngine uses BigTable as it's datastore backend.  Don't try to write a traditional relational-database driven application.  BigTable is much more well suited for use as a highly-scalable key-value store.  Avoid joins if at all possible.
