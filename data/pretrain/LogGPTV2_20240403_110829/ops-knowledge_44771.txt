I am considering using Google App Engine (GAE) for a large-scale website. Given the scale, I would appreciate any advice on using GAE. I have heard that GAE has certain restrictions, such as a 1MB limit on storing images or files (although I understand this may change according to the GAE roadmap), and a query result limit of 1000. Additionally, I plan to use web2py with GAE. Could you provide some insights and recommendations based on these considerations?

Thank you.

**Response:**

Google App Engine (GAE) uses BigTable as its datastore backend, which is fundamentally different from traditional relational databases. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Datastore Design:**
   - **Key-Value Store:** BigTable is optimized for use as a highly-scalable key-value store. It excels in scenarios where data can be accessed via unique keys.
   - **Avoid Joins:** Traditional SQL joins are not well-supported in BigTable. Instead, design your data model to minimize the need for joins. Consider denormalizing data where appropriate to improve read performance.

2. **File Storage:**
   - **1MB Limit:** Currently, there is a 1MB limit for storing files directly in the Datastore. However, this limitation is expected to be addressed in future updates, as mentioned in the GAE roadmap.
   - **Cloud Storage:** For larger files, consider using Google Cloud Storage (GCS). GCS is designed for storing and serving large files and integrates well with GAE.

3. **Query Limits:**
   - **1000 Results:** The default limit for query results is 1000. If you need to retrieve more than 1000 results, you can use cursors to paginate through the results.
   - **Optimization:** Ensure your queries are optimized to return only the necessary data. Use filters and indexes effectively to improve performance.

4. **Using web2py:**
   - **Compatibility:** web2py is compatible with GAE, but you will need to ensure that your application adheres to GAE's limitations and best practices.
   - **Customization:** You may need to customize some parts of web2py to work seamlessly with GAE, especially in terms of database interactions and file handling.

By keeping these points in mind, you can leverage the strengths of GAE while mitigating its limitations. If you have specific concerns or need further guidance, feel free to ask.
