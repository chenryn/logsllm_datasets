Three Points 
1. Networked technologies have the 
potential to automate enforcement of the 
law. 
2. Reckless and pervasive automation can 
have disastrous and unintended 
consequences. 
3. This audience is in a unique position to 
defend society and appropriately confront 
law enforcement systems.  
Automated Law Enforcement 
     Any computer-based system that uses input from 
unattended sensors to algorithmically determine that 
a crime has been or is about to be committed then 
takes some responsive action, such as to warn the 
subject or inform the appropriate law enforcement 
agency.  
    Additionally, these systems will be capable of 
automatically imposing some form of punishment.  
Our proposed conceptualization of automated law 
enforcement is based on a model that is subject to 
automation at various points.

    So when I get into a car—a computer that I put my 
body into—with my hearing aid*—a computer I put 
inside my body—I want to know that these 
technologies are not designed to keep secrets from 
me, or to prevent me from terminating processes on 
them that work against my interests.

* Note that this quote is taken a bit out of context.  Mr. Doctorow was 
speculating that he may require a hearing aid at some point in the future.

Quotas Exist 
      August 25, 2011 - This is to remind all PBA members that any threat of retaliation for 
failure to perform a specific numbers of police actions (summonses, stop and frisks, 
arrests etc.) within a specified time period is a violation of the quota law and a 
grievable offense.  We encourage all of our members who experience the threat of 
retaliation or punishment to file an immediate grievance with the PBA.  The attached 
form was developed to expedite the grievance process in these cases.
