### Office Template Macros

**Description:**

Adversaries may exploit Microsoft Office templates to establish persistence on a compromised system. These templates, which are integral to common Office applications, customize styles and are used each time an application starts.

Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros can be embedded into base templates to execute code when the respective Office application starts, thereby achieving persistence. Examples have been discovered in both Word and Excel. By default, Word includes a `Normal.dotm` template that can be modified to include a malicious macro. Excel does not have a default template, but one can be added to automatically load upon startup. Shared templates can also be stored and retrieved from remote locations.

- **Word Normal.dotm Location:**
  - `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Normal.dotm`

- **Excel Personal.xlsb Location:**
  - `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PERSONAL.XLSB`

Adversaries may change the location of the base template by hijacking the application's search order or modifying the `GlobalDotName` registry key. For example, Word 2016 will first look for `Normal.dotm` under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\`. By altering the `GlobalDotName` registry key, adversaries can specify a custom location, file name, and extension for the template. To abuse `GlobalDotName`, adversaries may need to register the template as a trusted document or place it in a trusted location.

Additionally, adversaries may need to enable macros to execute unrestricted, depending on the system or enterprise security policy regarding macro usage.

**Detection:**

Monitor for changes to Registry keys and files related to Office templates. Investigate modifications to base templates, such as `Normal.dotm`, since they should not typically contain VBA macros. Also, review changes to Office macro security settings.

### Virtual Private Server

**Description:**

Adversaries may rent Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) for use during their operations. Various cloud service providers offer virtual machines/containers as a service. By using a VPS, adversaries can obscure their physical location and benefit from the trust associated with reputable cloud service providers. Cloud infrastructure also allows for rapid provisioning, modification, and shutdown of resources.

Acquiring a VPS for later stages, such as Command and Control, can provide adversaries with the advantages of higher-reputation cloud service providers. Adversaries may also acquire VPSs from providers known for minimal registration requirements, allowing for more anonymous acquisitions.

**Detection:**

Internet scans can reveal servers acquired by adversaries. Look for identifiable patterns such as services listening, certificates in use, SSL/TLS negotiation features, or other response artifacts associated with adversary C2 software. Detection efforts may focus on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.

### Confluence

**Description:**

Adversaries may leverage Confluence repositories to extract valuable information. Confluence, often found in development environments alongside Atlassian JIRA, is used to store various types of useful information, including:

- Policies, procedures, and standards
- Physical and logical network diagrams
- System architecture diagrams
- Technical system documentation
- Testing and development credentials
- Work and project schedules
- Source code snippets
- Links to network shares and other internal resources

**Detection:**

Monitor access to Confluence repositories, especially by privileged users. Alert on users retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages, which may indicate programmatic data retrieval. User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms can detect and alert on user-based anomalies. Configure user access logging within Confluence to report access to certain pages and documents through `AccessLogFilter`.

### Pass the Ticket

**Description:**

Adversaries may "pass the ticket" using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. This method, known as Pass the Ticket (PtT), allows adversaries to authenticate to a system using Kerberos tickets without needing an account's password.

Valid Kerberos tickets for [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) are captured via [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). A user's service tickets or ticket-granting ticket (TGT) may be obtained. A service ticket allows access to a particular resource, while a TGT can request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access any resource the user has privileges to access.

A [Silver Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/002) can be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism, enabling access to specific resources and the hosting system. A [Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001) can be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, allowing the generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory.

Adversaries may also create valid Kerberos tickets using other user information, such as stolen password hashes or AES keys. For example, "overpassing the hash" involves using an NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user (i.e., [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002)) and creating a valid Kerberos ticket.

**Detection:**

Audit all Kerberos authentication and credential use events and review for discrepancies. Unusual remote authentication events that correlate with suspicious activity (such as writing and executing binaries) may indicate malicious activity.

### Container Administration Command

**Description:**

Adversaries may abuse container administration services to execute commands within a container. Services like the Docker daemon, Kubernetes API server, or kubelet allow remote management of containers.

In Docker, adversaries can specify an entrypoint during container deployment to execute a script or command, or use `docker exec` to run a command in a running container. In Kubernetes, if an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can gain remote execution in a container via the Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or `kubectl exec`.

**Detection:**

Capture container administration service activities and executed commands through logging of process execution with command-line arguments on the container and the underlying host. Docker daemon logs and Kubernetes system component logs can provide insights into these activities.

---

### File and Directory Discovery

**Description:**

Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or search specific locations on a host or network share for certain information. This information can shape follow-on behaviors, including whether the adversary fully infects the target and attempts specific actions.

Many command shell utilities, such as `dir`, `tree`, `ls`, `find`, and `locate`, can be used to obtain this information. Custom tools may also interact with the [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106). On network devices, adversaries may use the [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) to gather file and directory information (e.g., `dir`, `show flash`, and/or `nvram`).

**Detection:**

Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could gather system and network information. Use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and PowerShell to monitor and detect unexpected or unauthorized use of commands by non-standard users from non-standard locations.

### Dynamic Resolution

**Description:**

Adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure to evade detection. This is achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure to adjust parameters such as domain names, IP addresses, or port numbers.

Dynamic resolution can be used for [Fallback Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008). When contact is lost with the primary command and control server, malware may employ dynamic resolution to reestablish command and control.

**Detection:**

Detecting dynamically generated C2 can be challenging. Approaches include frequency analysis, Markov chains, entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more. Monitor for recently registered or rarely visited domains.

### Masquerade Task or Service

**Description:**

Adversaries may attempt to make tasks or services appear legitimate or benign by manipulating their names. Tasks/services executed by the Task Scheduler or systemd typically have a name and/or description. Many benign tasks and services exist with commonly associated names. Adversaries may give tasks or services names that are similar or identical to those of legitimate ones.

Tasks or services may also have fields, such as a description, that adversaries may attempt to make appear legitimate.

**Detection:**

Look for changes to tasks and services that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that create tasks or services. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as network connections made for Command and Control.

### Asynchronous Procedure Call

**Description:**

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the asynchronous procedure call (APC) queue to evade process-based defenses and potentially elevate privileges. APC injection executes arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

APC injection is commonly performed by attaching malicious code to the APC Queue of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state. A handle to an existing victim process is created using native Windows API calls, and `QueueUserAPC` can be used to invoke a function (such as `LoadLibrayA` pointing to a malicious DLL).

Variations include "Early Bird injection," which creates a suspended process to write and execute malicious code before the process's entry point, and "AtomBombing," which uses APCs to invoke malicious code written to the global atom table.

**Detection:**

Monitor Windows API calls indicative of code injection, such as `SuspendThread`, `SetThreadContext`, `ResumeThread`, `QueueUserAPC`, `NtQueueApcThread`, `VirtualAllocEx`, and `WriteProcessMemory`. Analyze process behavior to determine if a process is performing actions it usually does not, such as opening network connections, reading files, or other suspicious actions that could relate to post-compromise behavior.

### Traffic Duplication

**Description:**

Adversaries may leverage traffic mirroring to automate data exfiltration over compromised infrastructure. Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some devices, used for network analysis. Devices can be configured to forward network traffic to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device.

Adversaries may abuse traffic mirroring to redirect network traffic through infrastructure they control. Malicious modifications to network devices to enable traffic redirection may be possible through [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004) or [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001).

Cloud-based environments also support traffic mirroring. AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define instances to collect traffic from and targets to send collected traffic to.

Adversaries may use traffic duplication in conjunction with [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040), [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056), or [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557) depending on their goals.

**Detection:**

Monitor network traffic for uncommon data flows, such as unusual network communications, suspicious communications, or communications sending fixed-size data packets at regular intervals. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port being used.

### Plist File Modification

**Description:**

Adversaries may modify property list (plist) files to enable other malicious activities and potentially evade and bypass system defenses. macOS applications use plist files, such as `info.plist`, to store properties and configuration settings that inform the operating system how to handle the application at runtime. Plist files are structured metadata in key-value pairs formatted in XML based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD. Plist files can be saved in text or binary format.

Adversaries can modify key-value pairs in plist files to influence system behaviors, such as hiding the execution of an application (i.e., [Hidden Window](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/003)) or running additional commands for persistence (e.g., [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001)/[Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) or [Re-opened Applications](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/007)).

For example, adversaries can add a malicious application path to the `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist` file, which controls apps that appear in the Dock. Adversaries can also modify the `LSUIElement` key in an application’s `info.plist` file to run the app in the background. Adversaries can insert key-value pairs to insert environment variables, such as `LSEnvironment`, to enable persistence via [Dynamic Linker Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006).

**Detection:**

Monitor for common command-line editors used to modify plist files located in auto-run locations, such as `~/LaunchAgents`, `~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm`, and an application's `Info.plist`. Monitor for plist file modification immediately followed by code execution from `~/Library/Scripts` and `~/Library/Preferences`. Also, monitor for significant changes to any path pointers in a modified plist.

---

### AppCert DLLs

**Description:**

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert DLLs loaded into processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) specified in the `AppCertDLLs` Registry key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\` are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously used API functions `CreateProcess`, `CreateProcessAsUser`, `CreateProcessWithLoginW`, `CreateProcessWithTokenW`, or `WinExec`.

Similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055), this value can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. Malicious AppCert DLLs may also provide persistence by continuously being triggered by API activity.

**Detection:**

Monitor DLL loads by processes, specifically looking for DLLs that are not recognized or not normally loaded into a process. Monitor the `AppCertDLLs` Registry value for modifications that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc. Monitor and analyze API calls that are indicative of Registry edits such as `RegCreateKeyEx` and `RegSetValueEx`.

Tools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may overlook AppCert DLLs as an auto-starting location. Look for abnormal process behavior that may be due to a process loading a malicious DLL. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as making network connections for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and conducting Lateral Movement.

### CMSTP

**Description:**

The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. CMSTP.exe accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections.

Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands. Similar to [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1117) / "Squiblydoo," CMSTP.exe may be abused to load and execute DLLs and/or COM scriptlets (SCT) from remote servers. This execution may bypass AppLocker and other whitelisting defenses since CMSTP.exe is a legitimate, signed Microsoft application.

CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088) and execute arbitrary commands from a malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface.

**Detection:**

Use process monitoring to detect and analyze the execution and arguments of CMSTP.exe. Compare recent invocations of CMSTP.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.

Sysmon events can also be used to identify potential abuses of CMSTP.exe. Detection strategy may depend on the specific adversary procedure, but potential rules include:

- To detect loading and execution of local/remote payloads: Event 1 (Process creation) where ParentImage contains CMSTP.exe and/or Event 3 (Network connection) where Image contains CMSTP.exe and DestinationIP is external.
- To detect [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088) via an auto-elevated COM interface: Event 10 (ProcessAccess) where CallTrace contains CMLUA.dll and/or Event 12 or 13 (RegistryEvent) where TargetObject contains CMMGR32.exe. Also, monitor for events, such as the creation of processes (Sysmon Event 1), that involve auto-elevated CMSTP COM interfaces such as CMSTPLUA (3E5FC7F9-9A51-4367-9063-A120244FBEC7) and CMLUAUTIL (3E000D72-A845-4CD9-BD83-80C07C3B881F).

### Multi-hop Proxy

**Description:**

To disguise the source of malicious traffic, adversaries may chain together multiple proxies. Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop proxy. This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source.

**Detection:**

When observing the use of multi-hop proxies, network data from the actual command and control servers could allow correlating incoming and outgoing flows to trace malicious traffic back to its source. Multi-hop proxies can also be detected by alerting on traffic to known anonymity networks (such as [Tor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0183)) or known adversary infrastructure that uses this technique.
