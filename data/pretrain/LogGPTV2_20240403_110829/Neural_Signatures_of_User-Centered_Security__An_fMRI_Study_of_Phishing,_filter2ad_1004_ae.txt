regions 
There  were  also  qualitative  differences  in  activation 
between  processing  warning  and  non-warning  pop-ups. 
Warnings generated statistically significant increase in activity 
in  language  areas  of  the  brain,  such  as  LIFG  and  LMTG 
(Figure  9).  In  addition,  there  was  statistically  significant 
activation  in  bilateral  occipital  cortices,  which  may  provide 
evidence  of  how  much  visual  attention  and  inspection 
participants  were  engaging  in  during  warnings.  On  the  other 
hand,  non-warnings,  which  usually  were  not  a  threat  did  not 
generate any extra activation when compared with the warning 
condition.  
High  impulsivity,  the  tendency  to  act  quickly  without 
considering  the  broader,  especially  future,  consequences  of 
one’s  actions,  has  been  found  to  be  associated  with  several 
psychopathological  conditions  [40,  41].  Impulsive  decisions 
can  affect  user  safety  and  security  in  a  computer  security 
interaction  (as  we  demonstrated  in  the  case  of  phishing).  We 
found  trait  impulsivity  in  our  participants,  measured  by  the 
Barratt’s Impulsivity Scale, to negatively predict brain activity 
in  MPFC  and  precuneus  while  paying  attention  to  security 
warnings  (Figure  10).  Thus,  more  impulsive  participants  had 
less  activity  in  these  regions  during  the  malware  task.  This 
finding  is  consistent  with  findings  from  several  previous 
neuroimaging studies. For example, the precuneus  was found 
to  be  negatively  correlated  with  measures  of  impulsivity  in  a 
response  inhibition  task  [42].  MPFC  grey  matter  volume  has 
also  been  found  to  be  negatively  correlated  with  impulsivity 
[43].

regions  include  right  inferior  parietal  lobule  (RIPL),  right  middle/superior 
temporal  gyrus 
(RMTG/RSTG),  and  cuneus,  as  well  as  bilateral 
middle/superior  temporal  cortex,  and  right  parietal  in  the  postcentral  gyrus. 
(The  second  column  brain  images  do  not  show  any  activation;  they  are 
included for the sake of completeness) 
One  of  the  main  goals  of  this  study  was  to  examine  the 
brain  areas  that  may  mediate  how  people  approach  malware 
warnings.  The  participants  showed  significant  increase  in 
brain  activity  in  several  areas  while  processing  warnings, 
relative  to  non-warnings.  These  regions  include  LIFG  and 
LMTG,  both  primarily  associated  with  processing  language.  
There  was  also  increase  in  activity  in  regions,  such  as  the 
MPFC,  and  in  the  bilateral  occipital  cortices  (see  Figure  9). 
On  the  other  hand,  we  did  not  find  any  increase  in  brain 
activity for the non-warning condition, relative to the warning 
condition.

middle temporal gyrus (LMTG), left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) as well as 
medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and bilateral occipital cortices. 
In  order  to  examine  personality  traits  and  their  impact  on 
computer  security  decisions,  as  in  the  phishing  data  analysis, 
we  used  impulsivity  scores  as  a  covariate  in  a  regression 
analysis  with  brain  activity  while  reading  security  warnings. 
This  analysis  revealed  significant  negative  relationship 
between 
in  MPFC  and 
precuneus (see Figure 10).

B.  Behavioral Data Analysis 
Phishing  Detection  Experiment:  During 
the  phishing 
experiment,  we  instructed  the  participants  to  give  their 
response  during  the  trials  by  pressing  the  buttons  using  their 
index  fingers.  Each  participant  was  asked  to  use  his/her  left 
index finger to respond that the website is fake, and the right 
index  finger  to  respond  that  the  website  is  real.  Our  E-Prime 
interface  automatically  recorded  the  response  made  by  the 
participants and the corresponding response time.   
Based  on  this  recorded  data,  we  collected  statistics  for 
participant  accuracy  (acc)  and  response  time  (time)  for 
different types of trials, as summarized in Table IV. Accuracy 
is  defined  as  the  fraction  of  times  a  particular  trial  was 
correctly identified out of the total number of occurrences for 
that trial. 
We  can  observe  that,  on  an  average  across  all  trials,  the 
participants  spent  3.35  seconds  to  make  a  decision  but  the 
accuracy  was  only  around  60%,  i.e.,  40%  of  the  times,  they 
misidentified  a  fake  website  as  a  real  website  and  a  real 
website as a fake website. This accuracy is only slightly better 
than making a random guess. Prior work by Dhamija et al. [8] 
also  reported  very  similar  results  with  their  computer-based 
lab  study.  As  mentioned  in  Section  V.A,  our  neuroimaging 
data  indicated  strong  brain  activation  in  regions  associated 
with  decision  making  during  both  real  and  fake  judgment, 
particularly more during fake judgment. Although it is unclear 
why fake trials would show increased brain activity in RMFG 
but  poor  accuracy,  it  is  quite  possible  that  the  participants 
were putting more effort to identify fake websites but still not 
able to come up with the correct answers.

The average accuracy of identifying real websites was the 
highest  (about  77%)  and  much  higher  than  the  average 
accuracy of identifying fake websites (about 46%). Similar to 
the findings of our neural imaging data, this suggests that real 
website  detection  is  an  easier  task  compared  to  fake  website 
detection.  Intuitively,  the  accuracies  for  easy  fake  trials  were 
higher than for difficult trials (57% vs. 39%). 
The  average  response  time  for  all  types  of  trials  was 
similar,  over  3  s.  The  average  reaction  time  for  identifying 
easy fake website was the lowest and for identifying  difficult 
fake  website  was  the  highest.  We  also  found  a  statistically 
significant difference between the response time of easy fake 
and  difficult  fake  trials  (paired  t-test;  p-value  =  0.006;  CI  = 
  11 
95%). Easy fake websites had differences easier to distinguish 
than  the  difficult  fake  websites,  so  participants  might  have 
noticed  them  pretty  early  when  making  decision.  Moreover, 
the average time spent on deciding the difficult fake websites 
was  comparatively  more  than  the  time  spent  for  other  trials, 
but  still  the  accuracy  rate  for  difficult  fake  was  the  lowest 
among  all  trials.  The  participants  may  have  spent  more  time 
on  the  difficult  fake  trials  but  still  could  not  detect  them  as 
fake due to the level of difficulty associated with these trials. 
However,  we did not find  significant correlation between the 
response time and accuracy for any of the trials. 
Malware  Warnings  Experiment:  The  data  acquisition 
approach  for  the  malware  experiment  was  similar  to  that  for 
the  phishing  experiment.  The  participant  pressed  a  button 
using his or her left index finger to indicate “No” and a button 
using  his  or  her  right  index  finger  to  input  “Yes.”  For  the 
warnings conditions, pressing “No” was equivalent to heeding 
the  warning  and  “Yes”  was  equivalent  to  ignoring  the 
warning.

Similar to the phishing experiment, we collected statistics 
for  subjects’  accuracy  (acc)  and  response  time  (time)  for  the 
different  conditions,  as  summarized  in  Table  V.  Accuracy  is 
defined as the fraction of times a participant pressed “No” for 
a particular condition out of the total number of occurrences of 
that condition. 
An important observation is that the accuracy for heeding 
the  warnings  was  quite  high  (about  89%),  which  means  that 
participants paid attention to these warnings and chose not to 
“click-through”  most  times.  This  result  is  in  line  with  the 
results  from  a  recent  large-scale  field  study  of  Akhawe  and 
Felt  [11].  It  is  also  validated  by  the  high  brain  activation  in 
brain  regions  associated  with  problem  solving  and  decision 
making as shown by our neuroimaging analysis (Section V.A). 
We  can  also  see  that  participants  spent  shorter  amount  of 
time reacting to  warnings than non-warnings. This difference 
was  also  found  to  be  statistically  significant  (paired  t-test;  p-
value  =  0.04;  CI  =  95%).  Also,  the  probability  of  overriding 
the pop-up was less for warnings than non-warnings. A similar 
effect was observed via our neural data analysis. Overall, this 
indicates  that  the  content  of  warnings  might  have  been 
prominent enough to raise suspicion in the minds of the users, 
resulting in their pressing "No" more quickly. 
VI.  CROSS-EXPERIMENT ANALYSIS 
So  far,  we  have  presented  the  findings  drawn  from  the 
independent analysis of different experiments. One  important 
feature of our study design, involving multiple experiments in 
the  same scanning  session,  was to  facilitate  measuring  users’ 
performance  across  these  experiments.  In  this  section,  we 
present the results from such a cross-experiment analysis. 
A.  Phishing vs. Phishing Control 
task 
the  phishing 
In  order  to  examine  the  overlapping  and  unique  activity 
associated with the phishing task and a visual control task, we 
compared  the  phishing  with  the  phishing  control  experiment. 
While 
involved  participants  making 
judgments  about  whether  the  websites  were  “real”  or  “fake”, 
the  phishing  control  task  presented  the  same  websites  as  the 
stimuli, but the participants were told to relax and view them 
without  engaging  in  any  active  tasks.  Both  tasks  elicited 
significantly increased activity in the visual cortex, perhaps in 
line  with  the  visual  demands  of  the  stimuli.  However,  the 
phishing 
task  showed  significantly  greater  and  unique 
activation  in  various  regions,  such  as  RMFG  and  bilateral 
insula  (see  Figure  11),  a  pattern  not  seen  in  the  phishing 
control experiment. 
task  explicitly  examined  subjects’  ability 
phishing 
to 
distinguish  between  a  “real”  and  a  “fake”  website.  At  the 
neural  level,  we  examined  the  correlation  between  these  two 
tasks in terms of the brain activity in two regions, LMFG and 
RMFG, which are associated with decision-making. We found 
a  significant  positive  correlation  in  both  LMFG  and  RMFG 
activity,  particularly  in  the  RMFG  region  (see  Figures  12(a) 
and 12(b)). 
These  results  suggest  that  both  phishing  detection  and 
malware warnings involve similar, higher level cognitive and 
neural  processes.  We  may  also  infer  that  participants’ 
behavior  in  these  two  distinct  yet  related  tasks  may  be  well-
aligned in that one’s ability to heed malware warnings may be 
associated  with  his/her  decisions  about  the  legitimacy  of  a 
website  and  vice  versa.    Thus,  the  quality  of  online  security 
behavior may be determined by users’ cognitive ability and by 
the  selective  activation  of  specific  brain  areas  in  appropriate 
contexts.  
The  anterior  insula  has  been  implicated  in  a  variety  of 
functions,  such  as  affective  and  cognitive 
judgments. 
Activation  in  anterior  insula,  along  with  MFG,  has  been 
associated  with  making  choices  [44,  45].  The  middle  frontal 
gyrus  also  has  been  found  to  be  playing  a  critical  role  in 
cognitive control especially in selecting an appropriate choice 
of  action  [46].    The  activation  of  these  important  decision-
