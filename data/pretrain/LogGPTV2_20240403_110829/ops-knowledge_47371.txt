User: I'm trying to use the GCS client library with my app engine app and I ran into this - 
"In order to use the client library in your app, put the /src/cloudstorage directory in your sys.path so Python can find it."
First, does this mean I need to move the directory into my sys.path OR does it need to add the ~/src/cloudstorage/ to my PATH environment variable?
Second, when I print sys.version and sys.path from the App Engine Interactive Console, I see a Python Version of 2.7.2, but when I print from my Terminal (on a Mac), I get the Python I want to use and installed via Homebrew - 2.7.5. The sys.path in the Console shows all App Engine paths and the default Python installation - /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7
On my terminal - /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/
I need help understanding how to change this.
** UPDATE **
Okay, I figured out part of this answer. "In order to use the client library in your app, put the /src/cloudstorage directory in your sys.path so Python can find it." means moving the actual directory to the App Engine project directory.
The second piece still remains - why is my Mac PATH environment variable not used in APP Engine. How can I change the default version of Python used by the App Engine (from 2.7.2 to 2.7.5)? This is not related to changing the version in the YAML file.
Assistant: In GAE change the python path via Preferences settings, set Python Path to match your python 27 path.
