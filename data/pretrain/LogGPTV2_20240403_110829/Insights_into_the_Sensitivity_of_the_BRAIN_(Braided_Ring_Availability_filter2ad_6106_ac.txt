### Implementations Deploying 32-bit-based Computing Architectures for Handling Frames

In [22], Paulitsch et al. argue that the error detection coverage credit may be even lower.

We recognize that the described effects are specific to a particular CRC polynomial. To capture such weaknesses in inline integrity, this paper assumes that the undetected error rate of a 24-bit CRC is degraded by a factor of 10, resulting in an undetected error rate of 10 integrity violations per hour. Such integrity errors have significant safety implications. If the CRC size were increased to 32 bits, the undetected error rate would decrease to 0.07 (calculated as \(2^{-28} \times 1.8 \times 10^7\)).

It should also be understood that the safety analysis covers only passive devices and propagation errors, as is the case in FlexRay and TTP/C central guardians. If such relaying devices were to perform active protocol activities, the safety effects could be more severe.

Given these arguments, the model introduces a transition probability for integrity errors once a central guardian becomes arbitrarily faulty. The death states for the star model are defined as follows:

- An integrity fault occurred after one faulty star became arbitrarily faulty.
- More than one arbitrary end system component fault (not the star) occurred because protocol operations (clock synchronization, integration, or startup) cannot be guaranteed to work correctly anymore.
- Two faulty stars are present.

**Table 3: Overview of Dual Star-Specific Parameters**

| Parameter                    | Values                         |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Rate of undetected errors    | 10 (24-bit CRC), 0.07 (32-bit CRC), 0 (ideal reference model) |

In addition to the model parameters in Table 1, the star-specific model parameter introduces a rate for undetected integrity errors per hour (integrity violation) (see Table 3). Error detection for faulty stars is assumed to be near perfect. The CRC checks will likely signal a faulty star's propagation behavior most of the time, enabling near-perfect detection and indication of a failure condition to the driver. Note that the model is only valid for propagation failures and architectures like those in [24][25]. If the star needs to perform active protocol activities or store whole frames, the model may need to be adapted.

### Results and Discussion

This section presents the sensitivity of the BRAIN to certain parameters and compares it to a dual-star architecture. Reliability is the continuity of correct service. Traditionally, reliability results are given over a specific mission time. We argue that the loss of correct operation (missing availability or integrity of the platform) has safety implications. Thus, for our purposes, safety and reliability are synonymous. Safety numbers are often expressed as the probability of failing in an hour. We will present the reliability/safety probability numbers normalized to a per-hour number; i.e., the reliability number is divided by the service interval (the mission time) when the by-wire architecture is assumed to be inspected for failures in detail (scrubbing of any faults, including latent faults). The service interval is 150 hours for all experiments except for the experiment examining the sensitivity to different service intervals. Normalizing the probability facilitates comparison to industry standards like IEC61508. A typical safety number is \(10^{-9}\) failures/hour for highly critical operations. In aerospace, this \(10^{-9}\) number is also applied to a mission, such as a flight of 4-10 hours, resulting in a lower per-hour number. We assume \(10^{-9}\) failures/hour as the target for x-by-wire safety in this paper, inspired by [11]. It is important to note that such numbers must be evaluated in the context of accepted safety requirements, environmental factors, and other influencing factors. Aerospace has recognized similar trade-offs for engine electronics and time-limited dispatch [31].

All experiments show the (normalized) reliability number for different extended operations (the time it takes to get to the repair facility). The one-minute extended operation is assumed to be the (near) immediate repair, which is likely the time it takes for the driver to react to any indications of fault scenarios and to pull the car into a safe place to await towing or repair vehicles. On the other side of the spectrum is "no repair" during service intervals, meaning the driver keeps driving despite failures.

The difference between the near-immediate repair value and the extended operation value under consideration is the "cost" for the extended operation of the by-wire platform. This cost is the decreased safety due to prolonged operation despite subsystem failure. Increased comfort comes at a price. We will discuss targets for safety and the comfort trade-off in the next sections.

Unless varied or mentioned otherwise, the values used to produce the reliability numbers are the representative values in Table 1 and Table 2—namely, the number of active nodes is 10, the time between perfect detection of faults (service or mission interval) is 150 hours, the link failure rate is \(10^{-6}\), the arbitrary and fail-silent component failure rates are \(10^{-7}\) and \(10^{-5}\) respectively, and the extended operation time (repair rate) is 1 hour.

Note that the graphs include lines between the different values, although the x-axis results are not drawn proportionally to their value. This design makes it easier to identify different scenarios or parameters in the graph. The reader should not infer a direct trend from the lines. Also, watch the logarithmic y-axis scales.

#### 5.1. Comparison: BRAIN vs. Dual Star

**Figure 2: BRAIN Configurations**

The BRAIN comes in two configurations with slightly different forwarding algorithms. The full-duplex (FD) BRAIN configuration deploys full-duplex links for direct and skip links, so nodes have dedicated point-to-point links in both directions. The other configuration is a half-duplex (HD) BRAIN where nodes are connected with one shared wire pair, and only one node of the two sharing a link can send at a time to avoid collisions.

The HD BRAIN is the preferred solution for automotive systems, as it has fewer pins (80 over 120) and wires (60 over 80) compared to a 10-node FD BRAIN. The configurations deploy slightly different protocol mechanisms but aim at the same goals—prevention of fault propagation and error detection coverage for propagation. The model of the FD BRAIN is nearly the same, except that more hardware (e.g., redundant links) allows tolerance of more faults, although the greater amount of hardware means that more can fail.

This section compares the extended operation capabilities for two BRAIN configurations and three dual-star configurations.

In the dual-star configurations, frames are protected with a 24-bit CRC for data integrity in Configuration 1 (called "Star (24 bits)") and with 32 bits in Configuration 2 (called "Star (32 bits)"). In Configuration 3, the protection of inline integrity is assumed to be perfect (perfect isolation), and end systems are able to choose the correct data from the correct star, leading to no integrity violations and safety implications in case of an arbitrarily faulty star. A self-checking guardian may be a real implementation of such a near-perfect guardian. Alternatively, diagnosis algorithms at the end systems may provide protection. The third configuration is supplied only for reference to evaluate the impact of inline integrity (CRCs) on the reliability of the platform. Similar reliability numbers may be achievable for triplex stars without reliance on inline integrity if voting is deployed to mask a faulty star.

**Figure 3: Normalized Reliability for BRAIN and Dual-Star Networks**

Overall, the BRAIN is very strong compared to dual-star architectures. While the reference model with perfect inline error detection coverage (called "star (perfect isolation)") is at the same safety level as BRAIN variants, indicating a correct model, the actual dual-star approaches have significantly lower reliability numbers due to imperfect inline integrity (CRC) error coverage, resulting in some integrity violations per hour.

The results show that dual stars with 32-bit CRC can meet the \(10^{-9}\) target only for immediate repair, and the use of the 24-bit version does not meet the \(10^{-9}\) target at all. Given that the number of connectors and links for a dual-star and the HD BRAIN is the same and no additional star component is needed, the BRAIN achieves a significant increase in system dependability.

#### 5.2. Sensitivity to Component Failure Rate

**5.2.1. Arbitrary Mode.** Figure 4 presents the sensitivity of reliability numbers to arbitrary component failures. Such data can support decisions about whether to integrate communication functionality into single chips. The larger the die area, the more likely arbitrary failure modes are according to chip reliability models.

**5.2.2. Fail-Silent Mode.** Figure 5 depicts the sensitivity of the BRAIN to fail-silent component failures. With a low MTBF of 50,000 hours (failure rate of \(2 \times 10^{-5}\)), the two-hour extended operation is very close to the safety target \(10^{-9}\), probably too close if model inaccuracies are considered.

#### 5.3. Sensitivity to Link Failure Rate

**Figure 6** depicts the reliability for varying link failure rates. With an increasing link failure rate, the sensitivity of the reliability seems to increase. At a link failure rate of \(5 \times 10^{-6}\) and one-hour extended operation, the reliability is close to a \(10^{-9}\) safety target.

#### 5.4. Sensitivity to Active Components

**Figure 7** depicts the sensitivity of safety to the number of components. The BRAIN is a ring network, and thus, in addition to a larger number of components that can fail, ring serialization does have a slight impact. To a large extent, the BRAIN's robustness is maintained, but the number of active components can affect overall reliability.
