argue that the error detection coverage credit may  even 
be less.  
We recognize that the described effects are specific to 
a special CRC polynomial. But, in order to capture such 
weaknesses  of  inline  integrity,  this  paper  assumes  that 
the undetected error rate of a 24-bit CRC is degraded by 
a factor of 10; resulting in a rate of 10 integrity violations 
per  hour.  Such  integrity  errors  have  platform  safety 
implication.  If  the  CRC  size  would  be  increased  to 
32bits, the rate would decrease to 0.07 (=2-28 x 1.8 x 107). 
It  should  also  be  understood  that  the  safety  analysis 
covers only passive devices and propagation errors as is 
the case in FlexRay and TTP/C central guardians. If such 
relaying  devices  were 
to  perform  active  protocol 
activities, the safety effects may be more severe.  
Given  these  arguments,  the  model  introduces  a 
transition  probability  for  integrity  errors  once  a  central 
guardian is arbitrarily faulty. The death states for the star 
model are defined as:

In  addition  to  the  model  parameters  of  Table  1,  the 
star-specific  model  parameter  introduces  a  rate  for  the 
undetected integrity  errors per hour (integrity  violation) 
(see Table 3). 
Error detection of  faulty  stars is assumed to  be near 
perfect. The CRC checks will likely signal a faulty star 
propagation behavior for most of the time enabling near 
perfect detection for the indication of a failure condition 
to the driver. Again, please note that the model is only 
valid  for  propagation  failures  and  architectures  like 
[24][25]. Once the star needs to perform active protocol 
activities or stores whole frames, the model may need to 
be adapted.  
5. Results and Discussion 
This section gives the result of the sensitivity  of the 
BRAIN to certain parameters and a comparison to a dual 
star  architecture.  Reliability  is  the  continuity  of  correct 
service. Reliability results are traditionally given over a 
specific  mission  time.  We  have  argued  that  the  loss  of 
correct operation (missing availability or integrity of the 
platform)  has  safety  effects.  Thus,  for  our  purposes, 
safety  and  reliability  are  the  same.  Safety  numbers  are 
often expressed as probability of failing in an hour. We 
will  present  the  reliability/safety  probability  numbers 
normalized  to  a  per  hour  number;  i.e.  the  reliability 
number  is  divided  by  the  service  interval  (the  mission 
time)  when  the  by-wire  architecture  is  assumed  to  be 
inspected  for  failures in detail (scrubbing of any  faults, 
including latent faults). The service interval is 150 hours 
for all experiments except for the experiment examining 
the  sensitivity 
intervals.  The 
normalization of the probability alleviates comparison to 
industry  standard  like  IEC61508.  A  typical  safety 
number is 10-9 failures/hour for highly critical operation 
(in  aerospace,  this  10-9  number  is  also  applied  to  a 
mission,  such  as  a  flight  of  4-10  hours,  resulting  in  a 
lower per hour number). We assume 10-9 failures/hour as 
the target for x-by-wire safety in this paper inspired by 
[11]. It is important to note that such numbers must be 
evaluated in the context of accepted safety requirements, 
environ-mental  factors,  and  other  factors  influencing 
to  different  service 
safety.  Aerospace  has  recognized  similar  tradeoffs  for 
engine electronics and time-limited dispatch [31]. 
All  experiments  show  the  (normalized)  reliability 
number  for  different  extended  operations  (the  time  it 
takes  to  get  to  the  repair  facility).  The  one  minute 
extended operation is assumed to be the (near) immediate 
repair, which is likely the time it takes for the driver to 
react to any indications of fault scenarios and to pull the 
car  into  a  safe  place  to  await  for  towing  or  repair 
vehicles.  
On the other side of the spectrum is “no repair” during 
service  intervals,  which  means  that  the  driver  keeps 
driving despite failures.  
The  difference  between  the  near  immediate  repair 
value  and 
the  extended  operation  value  under 
consideration is the “cost” for the extended operation of 
the  by-wire  platform.  It  is  the  decreased  safety  due  to 
prolonged  operation  despite  subsystem  failure.  The 
increased  comfort  comes  at  a  price.  We  will  discuss 
targets  for  safety  and  the  comfort  tradeoff  in  the  next 
sections. 
Unless varied or mentioned otherwise, the values used 
to produce the reliability numbers are the representative 
values of Table 1 and Table 2 – namely the number of 
active nodes is 10, the time between perfect detection of 
faults  (service  or  mission  interval)  is  150  hours,  link 
failure rate is 10-6, the arbitrary and fail-silent component 
failure  rates  are  10-7  and  10-5  respectively,  and  the 
extended operation time (repair rate) is 1 hour.  
Note  that  the  graphs  include  lines  between  the 
different values, although the x-axis results are not drawn 
proportionally to their value. This design makes it easier 
to identify different scenarios or parameters in the graph. 
The reader should not infer a direct trend from the lines. 
Also watch the logarithmic y-axis scales.

The  BRAIN  comes  in  two  configurations  having 
slightly different forwarding algorithms. The full-duplex 
(FD) BRAIN configuration deploys full-duplex links for 
direct and skip links, so nodes have dedicated point-to-
point links in both directions. The other configuration is a 
half-duplex  (HD)  BRAIN  where  nodes  are  connected 
with one shared wire pair, and only one node of the two 
sharing a link can send at a time to avoid collisions.

the  1-minute

the 10-9 target mentioned for up to the 2-hour extended 
period.  One  hour  was  the  proposed  extended  operation 
that would be needed to achieve the comfort to drive to 
the next garage or home. For the HD BRAIN, this results 
in a “decreased” safety number of 3.92x10-12 to 2.34x10-

safety number that is still acceptable.

make  the  FD  BRAIN  more  robust  to  redundancy

actually slightly more robust compared to the FD BRAIN 
despite less hardware. The additional hardware of the FD 
BRAIN is offset by more parts failing.

Figure 3: Normalized reliability for BRAIN and 
dual-star networks  
Overall, BRAIN is very strong compared to dual star 
architectures.  While  the  reference  model  with  perfect 
inline  error  detection  coverage  (called  “star  (perfect 
isolation)”)  is  at  the  same  safety  level  as  BRAIN 
variants, indicating a correct model, the actual dual star 
approaches  have  significantly  lower  reliability  numbers 
due  to  the  imperfect  inline  integrity  (CRC)  error 
coverage resulting in some integrity violations per hour.  
The results show that dual stars with 32bit CRC can 
meet the 10-9 target only for immediate repair and the use 
of 24bit version does not meet the 10-9 target at all.  
is  needed, 
Given that the number of  connectors and links for a 
dual-star  and  the  HD  BRAIN  is  the  same  and  no 
additional  star  component 
the  BRAIN 
achieves a significant increase in system dependability.  
5.2. Sensitivity to Component Failure Rate 
5.2.1. Arbitrary Mode. Figure 4 presents the sensitivity 
of  reliability  numbers  to  arbitrary  component  failures. 
Such  data  can  support  decisions  about  whether  to 
integrate communication functionality into single chips. 
The larger the die area, the more likely arbitrary failures 
modes are according to reliability models of chips. 
5.2.2. Fail-Silent Mode. Figure 5 depicts the sensitivity 
of  the  BRAIN  to  fail-silent  component  failures.  With  a 
low  MTBF  of  50000  hours  (failure  rate  of  2x10-5)  the 
two hour extended operation is very close to the safety 
target  10-9,  probably  too  close  if  model  inaccuracies 
where evaluated.  
5.3. Sensitivity to Link Failure Rate 
Figure 6 depicts the reliability for varying link failure 
rates. With an increasing link failure rate, the sensitivity 
of the reliability seems to increase. At a link failure rate 
of 5x10-6 and one hour extended operation, the reliability 
is close to a 10-9 safety target.

Figure 7 depicts sensitivity of safety to the number of 
components. The BRAIN is a ring network and, thus, in 
addition to a larger number of components that can fail, 
ring  serialization  does  have  a  slight  impact.  To  a  large
