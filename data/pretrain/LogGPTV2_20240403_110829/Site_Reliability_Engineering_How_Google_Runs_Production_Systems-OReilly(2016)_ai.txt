• A product manager whose schedule is not affected by low-quality automation 	will always prioritize new features over simplicity and automation.The most functional tools are usually written by those who use them. A similar argu‐ment applies to why product development teams benefit from keeping at least some operational awareness of their systems in production.Turnups were again high-latency, inaccurate, and incompetent—the worst of all worlds. However, an unrelated security mandate allowed us out of this trap. Much of distributed automation relied at that time on SSH. This is clumsy from a security per‐spective, because people must have root on many machines to run most commands. A growing awareness of advanced, persistent security threats drove us to reduce the privileges SREs enjoyed to the absolute minimum they needed to do their jobs. We had to replace our use of sshd with an authenticated, ACL-driven, RPC-based Local Admin Daemon, also known as Admin Servers, which had permissions to perform those local changes. As a result, no one could install or modify a server without an audit trail. Changes to the Local Admin Daemon and the Package Repo were gated on code reviews, making it very difficult for someone to exceed their authority; giving someone the access to install packages would not let them view colocated logs. The Admin Server logged the RPC requestor, any parameters, and the results of all RPCs to enhance debugging and security audits.80  |  Chapter 7: The Evolution of Automation at Google
Service-Oriented Cluster-Turnup
In the next iteration, Admin Servers became part of service teams’ workflows, both as related to the machine-specific Admin Servers (for installing packages and rebooting) and cluster-level Admin Servers (for actions like draining or turning up a service). SREs moved from writing shell scripts in their home directories to building peer-reviewed RPC servers with fine-grained ACLs.Later on, after the realization that turnup processes had to be owned by the teams that owned the services fully sank in, we saw this as a way to approach cluster turnup as a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) problem: service owners would be respon‐sible for creating an Admin Server to handle cluster turnup/turndown RPCs, sent by the system that knew when clusters were ready. In turn, each team would provide the contract (API) that the turnup automation needed, while still being free to change the underlying implementation. As a cluster reached “network-ready,” automation sent an RPC to each Admin Server that played a part in turning up the cluster.We now have a low-latency, competent, and accurate process; most importantly, this process has stayed strong as the rate of change, the number of teams, and the number of services seem to double each year.
As mentioned earlier, our evolution of turnup automation followed a path:
1. Operator-triggered manual action (no automation)
2. Operator-written, system-specific automation3. Externally maintained generic automation
4. Internally maintained, system-specific automation
5. Autonomous systems that need no human intervention
While this evolution has, broadly speaking, been a success, the Borg case study illus‐trates another way we have come to think of the problem of automation.
Borg: Birth of the Warehouse-Scale ComputerAnother way to understand the development of our attitude toward automation, and when and where that automation is best deployed, is to consider the history of the development of our cluster management systems.6 Like MySQL on Borg, which demonstrated the success of converting manual operations to automatic ones, and the cluster turnup process, which demonstrated the downside of not thinking carefully enough about where and how automation was implemented, developing cluster man‐6 We have compressed and simplified this history to aid understanding.
Borg: Birth of the Warehouse-Scale Computer  |  81
agement also ended up demonstrating another lesson about how automation should be done. Like our previous two examples, something quite sophisticated was created as the eventual result of continuous evolution from simpler beginnings.Google’s clusters were initially deployed much like everyone else’s small networks of the time: racks of machines with specific purposes and heterogeneous configurations. Engineers would log in to some well-known “master” machine to perform adminis‐trative tasks; “golden” binaries and configuration lived on these masters. As we had only one colo provider, most naming logic implicitly assumed that location. As pro‐duction grew, and we began to use multiple clusters, different domains (cluster names) entered the picture. It became necessary to have a file describing what each machine did, which grouped machines under some loose naming strategy. This descriptor file, in combination with the equivalent of a parallel SSH, allowed us to reboot (for example) all the search machines in one go. Around this time, it was com‐mon to get tickets like “search is done with machine x1, crawl can have the machine now.”Automation development began. Initially automation consisted of simple Python scripts for operations such as the following:
• Service management: keeping services running (e.g., restarts after segfaults)
• Tracking what services were supposed to run on which machines
• Log message parsing: SSHing into each machine and looking for regexpsAutomation eventually mutated into a proper database that tracked machine state, and also incorporated more sophisticated monitoring tools. With the union set of the automation available, we could now automatically manage much of the lifecycle of machines: noticing when machines were broken, removing the services, sending them to repair, and restoring the configuration when they came back from repair.But to take a step back, this automation was useful yet profoundly limited, due to the fact that abstractions of the system were relentlessly tied to physical machines. We needed a new approach, hence Borg [Ver15] was born: a system that moved away from the relatively static host/port/job assignments of the previous world, toward treating a collection of machines as a managed sea of resources. Central to its success—and its conception—was the notion of turning cluster management into an entity for which API calls could be issued, to some central coordinator. This liberated extra dimensions of efficiency, flexibility, and reliability: unlike the previous model of machine “ownership,” Borg could allow machines to schedule, for example, batch and user-facing tasks on the same machine.82  |  Chapter 7: The Evolution of Automation at GoogleThis functionality ultimately resulted in continuous and automatic operating system upgrades with a very small amount of constant7 effort—effort that does not scale with the total size of production deployments. Slight deviations in machine state are now automatically fixed; brokenness and lifecycle management are essentially no-ops for SRE at this point. Thousands of machines are born, die, and go into repairs daily with no SRE effort. To echo the words of Ben Treynor Sloss: by taking the approach that this was a software problem, the initial automation bought us enough time to turn cluster management into something autonomous, as opposed to automated. We achieved this goal by bringing ideas related to data distribution, APIs, hub-and-spoke architectures, and classic distributed system software development to bear upon the domain of infrastructure management.An interesting analogy is possible here: we can make a direct mapping between the single machine case and the development of cluster management abstractions. In this view, rescheduling on another machine looks a lot like a process moving from one CPU to another: of course, those compute resources happen to be at the other end of a network link, but to what extent does that actually matter? Thinking in these terms, rescheduling looks like an intrinsic feature of the system rather than something one would “automate”—humans couldn’t react fast enough anyway. Similarly in the case of cluster turnup: in this metaphor, cluster turnup is simply additional schedulable capacity, a bit like adding disk or RAM to a single computer. However, a single-node computer is not, in general, expected to continue operating when a large number of components fail. The global computer is—it must be self-repairing to operate once it grows past a certain size, due to the essentially statistically guaranteed large number of failures taking place every second. This implies that as we move systems up the hierarchy from manually triggered, to automatically triggered, to autonomous, some capacity for self-introspection is necessary to survive.Reliability Is the Fundamental Feature
Of course, for effective troubleshooting, the details of internal operation that the introspection relies upon should also be exposed to the humans managing the overall system. Analogous discussions about the impact of automation in the noncomputer domain—for example, in airplane flight8 or industrial applications—often point out the downside of highly effective automation:9 human operators are progressively more relieved of useful direct contact with the system as the automation covers more and more daily activities over time. Inevitably, then, a situation arises in which the automation fails, and the humans are now unable to successfully operate the system.7 As in a small, unchanging number.
8 See, e.g., .
9 See, e.g., [Bai83] and [Sar97].
Reliability Is the Fundamental Feature  |  83The fluidity of their reactions has been lost due to lack of practice, and their mental models of what the system should be doing no longer reflect the reality of what it is doing.10 This situation arises more when the system is nonautonomous—i.e., where automation replaces manual actions, and the manual actions are presumed to be always performable and available just as they were before. Sadly, over time, this ulti‐mately becomes false: those manual actions are not always performable because the functionality to permit them no longer exists.We, too, have experienced situations where automation has been actively harmful on a number of occasions—see “Automation: Enabling Failure at Scale” on page 85—but in Google’s experience, there are more systems for which automation or autonomous behavior are no longer optional extras. As you scale, this is of course the case, but there are still strong arguments for more autonomous behavior of systems irrespec‐tive of size. Reliability is the fundamental feature, and autonomous, resilient behavior is one useful way to get that.RecommendationsYou might read the examples in this chapter and decide that you need to be Google-scale before you have anything to do with automation whatsoever. This is untrue, for two reasons: automation provides more than just time saving, so it’s worth imple‐menting in more cases than a simple time-expended versus time-saved calculation might suggest. But the approach with the highest leverage actually occurs in the design phase: shipping and iterating rapidly might allow you to implement function‐ality faster, yet rarely makes for a resilient system. Autonomous operation is difficult to convincingly retrofit to sufficiently large systems, but standard good practices in software engineering will help considerably: having decoupled subsystems, introduc‐ing APIs, minimizing side effects, and so on.10 This is yet another good reason for regular practice drills; see “Disaster Role Playing” on page 401.
84  |  Chapter 7: The Evolution of Automation at Google
Automation: Enabling Failure at ScaleGoogle runs over a dozen of its own large datacenters, but we also depend on machines in many third-party colocation facilities (or “colos”). Our machines in these colos are used to terminate most incoming connections, or as a cache for our own Content Delivery Network, in order to lower end-user latency. At any point in time, a number of these racks are being installed or decommissioned; both of these processes are largely automated. One step during decommission involves overwriting the full content of the disk of all the machines in the rack, after which point an independent system verifies the successful erase. We call this process “Diskerase.”Once upon a time, the automation in charge of decommissioning a particular rack failed, but only after the Diskerase step had completed successfully. Later, the decom‐mission process was restarted from the beginning, to debug the failure. On that itera‐tion, when trying to send the set of machines in the rack to Diskerase, the automation determined that the set of machines that still needed to be Diskerased was (correctly) empty. Unfortunately, the empty set was used as a special value, interpreted to mean“everything.” This means the automation sent almost all the machines we have in all colos to Diskerase.Within minutes, the highly efficient Diskerase wiped the disks on all machines in our CDN, and the machines were no longer able to terminate connections from users (or do anything else useful). We were still able to serve all the users from our own data‐centers, and after a few minutes the only effect visible externally was a slight increase in latency. As far as we could tell, very few users noticed the problem at all, thanks to good capacity planning (at least we got that right!). Meanwhile, we spent the better part of two days reinstalling the machines in the affected colo racks; then we spent the following weeks auditing and adding more sanity checks—including rate limiting—into our automation, and making our decommission workflow idempotent.Recommendations  |  85
CHAPTER 8
Release Engineering
Written by Dinah McNutt Edited by Betsy Beyer and Tim Harvey
Release engineering is a relatively new and fast-growing discipline of software engi‐neering that can be concisely described as building and delivering software [McN14a]. Release engineers have a solid (if not expert) understanding of source code management, compilers, build configuration languages, automated build tools, package managers, and installers. Their skill set includes deep knowledge of multiple domains: development, configuration management, test integration, system adminis‐tration, and customer support.Running reliable services requires reliable release processes. Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) need to know that the binaries and configurations they use are built in a reproducible, automated way so that releases are repeatable and aren’t “unique snow‐flakes.” Changes to any aspect of the release process should be intentional, rather than accidental. SREs care about this process from source code to deployment.Release engineering is a specific job function at Google. Release engineers work with software engineers (SWEs) in product development and SREs to define all the steps required to release software—from how the software is stored in the source code repository, to build rules for compilation, to how testing, packaging, and deployment are conducted.
The Role of a Release EngineerThe Role of a Release Engineer
Google is a data-driven company and release engineering follows suit. We have tools that report on a host of metrics, such as how much time it takes for a code change to be deployed into production (in other words, release velocity) and statistics on what
87
features are being used in build configuration files [Ada15]. Most of these tools were envisioned and developed by release engineers.Release engineers define best practices for using our tools in order to make sure projects are released using consistent and repeatable methodologies. Our best practi‐ces cover all elements of the release process. Examples include compiler flags, formats for build identification tags, and required steps during a build. Making sure that our tools behave correctly by default and are adequately documented makes it easy for teams to stay focused on features and users, rather than spending time reinventing the wheel (poorly) when it comes to releasing software.Google has a large number of SREs who are charged with safely deploying products and keeping Google services up and running. In order to make sure our release pro‐cesses meet business requirements, release engineers and SREs work together to develop strategies for canarying changes, pushing out new releases without interrupt‐ing services, and rolling back features that demonstrate problems.
PhilosophyPhilosophy
Release engineering is guided by an engineering and service philosophy that’s expressed through four major principles, detailed in the following sections.
Self-Service ModelIn order to work at scale, teams must be self-sufficient. Release engineering has devel‐oped best practices and tools that allow our product development teams to control and run their own release processes. Although we have thousands of engineers and products, we can achieve a high release velocity because individual teams can decide how often and when to release new versions of their products. Release processes can be automated to the point that they require minimal involvement by the engineers, and many projects are automatically built and released using a combination of our automated build system and our deployment tools. Releases are truly automatic, and only require engineer involvement if and when problems arise.High Velocity
User-facing software (such as many components of Google Search) is rebuilt fre‐quently, as we aim to roll out customer-facing features as quickly as possible. We have embraced the philosophy that frequent releases result in fewer changes between ver‐sions. This approach makes testing and troubleshooting easier. Some teams perform hourly builds and then select the version to actually deploy to production from the resulting pool of builds. Selection is based upon the test results and the features con‐tained in a given build. Other teams have adopted a “Push on Green” release model and deploy every build that passes all tests [Kle14].88  |  Chapter 8: Release Engineering
Hermetic Builds
Build tools must allow us to ensure consistency and repeatability. If two people attempt to build the same product at the same revision number in the source code repository on different machines, we expect identical results.1 Our builds are her‐metic, meaning that they are insensitive to the libraries and other software installed on the build machine. Instead, builds depend on known versions of build tools, such as compilers, and dependencies, such as libraries. The build process is self-contained and must not rely on services that are external to the build environment.Rebuilding older releases when we need to fix a bug in software that’s running in pro‐duction can be a challenge. We accomplish this task by rebuilding at the same revi‐sion as the original build and including specific changes that were submitted after that point in time. We call this tactic cherry picking. Our build tools are themselves versioned based on the revision in the source code repository for the project being built. Therefore, a project built last month won’t use this month’s version of the com‐piler if a cherry pick is required, because that version may contain incompatible or undesired features.Enforcement of Policies and Procedures
Several layers of security and access control determine who can perform specific operations when releasing a project. Gated operations include:
• Approving source code changes—this operation is managed through configura‐	tion files scattered throughout the codebase
• Specifying the actions to be performed during the release process
• Creating a new release• Creating a new release
• Approving the initial integration proposal (which is a request to perform a build at a specific revision number in the source code repository) and subsequent cherry picks
• Deploying a new release
• Making changes to a project’s build configurationAlmost all changes to the codebase require a code review, which is a streamlined action integrated into our normal developer workflow. Our automated release system produces a report of all changes contained in a release, which is archived with other build artifacts. By allowing SREs to understand what changes are included in a new

release of a project, this report can expedite troubleshooting when there are problems with a release.
Continuous Build and Deployment
Google has developed an automated release system called Rapid. Rapid is a system that leverages a number of Google technologies to provide a framework that delivers scalable, hermetic, and reliable releases. The following sections describe the software lifecycle at Google and how it is managed using Rapid and other associated tools.Building
Blaze2 is Google’s build tool of choice. It supports building binaries from a range of languages, including our standard languages of C++, Java, Python, Go, and Java‐Script. Engineers use Blaze to define build targets (e.g., the output of a build, such as a JAR file), and to specify the dependencies for each target. When performing a build, Blaze automatically builds the dependency targets.Build targets for binaries and unit tests are defined in Rapid’s project configuration files. Project-specific flags, such as a unique build identifier, are passed by Rapid to Blaze. All binaries support a flag that displays the build date, the revision number, and the build identifier, which allow us to easily associate a binary to a record of how it was built.
BranchingAll code is checked into the main branch of the source code tree (mainline). How‐ever, most major projects don’t release directly from the mainline. Instead, we branch from the mainline at a specific revision and never merge changes from the branch back into the mainline. Bug fixes are submitted to the mainline and then cherry picked into the branch for inclusion in the release. This practice avoids inadvertently picking up unrelated changes submitted to the mainline since the original build occurred. Using this branch and cherry pick method, we know the exact contents of each release.Testing
A continuous test system runs unit tests against the code in the mainline each time a change is submitted, allowing us to detect build and test failures quickly. Release engineering recommends that the continuous build test targets correspond to the same test targets that gate the project release. We also recommend creating releases at
2 Blaze has been open sourced as Bazel. See “Bazel FAQ” on the Bazel website, .90  |  Chapter 8: Release Engineering
the revision number (version) of the last continuous test build that successfully com‐pleted all tests. These measures decrease the chance that subsequent changes made to the mainline will cause failures during the build performed at release time.During the release process, we re-run the unit tests using the release branch and cre‐ate an audit trail showing that all the tests passed. This step is important because if a release involves cherry picks, the release branch may contain a version of the code that doesn’t exist anywhere on the mainline. We want to guarantee that the tests pass in the context of what’s actually being released.To complement the continuous test system, we use an independent testing environ‐ment that runs system-level tests on packaged build artifacts. These tests can be launched manually or from Rapid.
PackagingSoftware is distributed to our production machines via the Midas Package Manager (MPM) [McN14c]. MPM assembles packages based on Blaze rules that list the build artifacts to include, along with their owners and permissions. Packages are named (e.g., search/shakespeare/frontend), versioned with a unique hash, and signed to ensure authenticity. MPM supports applying labels to a particular version of a pack‐age. Rapid applies a label containing the build ID, which guarantees that a package can be uniquely referenced using the name of the package and this label.Labels can be applied to an MPM package to indicate a package’s location in the release process (e.g., dev, canary, or production). If you apply an existing label to a new package, the label is automatically moved from the old package to the new pack‐age. For example: if a package is labeled as canary, someone subsequently installing the canary version of that package will automatically receive the newest version of the package with the label canary.Rapid
Figure 8-1 shows the main components of the Rapid system. Rapid is configured with files called blueprints. Blueprints are written in an internal configuration language and are used to define build and test targets, rules for deployment, and administrative information (like project owners). Role-based access control lists determine who can perform specific actions on a Rapid project.Continuous Build and Deployment  |  91
Figure 8-1. Simplified view of Rapid architecture showing the main components of the system
Each Rapid project has workflows that define the actions to perform during the release process. Workflow actions can be performed serially or in parallel, and a workflow can launch other workflows. Rapid dispatches work requests to tasks run‐ning as a Borg job on our production servers. Because Rapid uses our production infrastructure, it can handle thousands of release requests simultaneously.A typical release process proceeds as follows:
1. Rapid uses the requested integration revision number (often obtained automati‐	cally from our continuous test system) to create a release branch.
2. Rapid uses Blaze to compile all the binaries and execute the unit tests, often per‐forming these two steps in parallel. Compilation and testing occur in environ‐ments dedicated to those specific tasks, as opposed to taking place in the Borg job where the Rapid workflow is executing. This separation allows us to parallelize work easily.3. Build artifacts are then available for system testing and canary deployments. A typical canary deployment involves starting a few jobs in our production envi‐ronment after the completion of system tests.
4. The results of each step of the process are logged. A report of all changes since 	the last release is created.
Rapid allows us to manage our release branches and cherry picks; individual cherry pick requests can be approved or rejected for inclusion in a release.92  |  Chapter 8: Release Engineering
Deployment
Rapid is often used to drive simple deployments directly. It updates the Borg jobs to use newly built MPM packages based on deployment definitions in the blueprint files and specialized task executors.For more complicated deployments, we use Sisyphus, which is a general-purpose roll‐out automation framework developed by SRE. A rollout is a logical unit of work that is composed of one or more individual tasks. Sisyphus provides a set of Python classes that can be extended to support any deployment process. It has a dashboard that allows for finer control on how the rollout is performed and provides a way to monitor the rollout’s progress.In a typical integration, Rapid creates a rollout in a long-running Sisyphus job. Rapid knows the build label associated with the MPM package it created, and can specify that build label when creating the rollout in Sisyphus. Sisyphus uses the build label to specify which version of the MPM packages should be deployed.With Sisyphus, the rollout process can be as simple or complicated as necessary. For example, it can update all the associated jobs immediately or it can roll out a new binary to successive clusters over a period of several hours.Our goal is to fit the deployment process to the risk profile of a given service. In development or pre-production environments, we may build hourly and push relea‐ses automatically when all tests pass. For large user-facing services, we may push by starting in one cluster and expand exponentially until all clusters are updated. For sensitive pieces of infrastructure, we may extend the rollout over several days, inter‐leaving them across instances in different geographic regions.Configuration Management
Configuration management is one area of particularly close collaboration between release engineers and SREs. Although configuration management may initially seem a deceptively simple problem, configuration changes are a potential source of insta‐bility. As a result, our approach to releasing and managing system and service config‐urations has evolved substantially over time. Today we use several models for distributing configuration files, as described in the following paragraphs. All schemes involve storing configuration in our primary source code repository and enforcing a strict code review requirement.Use the mainline for configuration. This was the first method used to configure serv‐ices in Borg (and the systems that pre-dated Borg). Using this scheme, developers and SREs modify configuration files at the head of the main branch. The changes are reviewed and then applied to the running system. As a result, binary releases and configuration changes are decoupled. While conceptually and procedurally simple,Configuration Management  |  93
this technique often leads to skew between the checked-in version of the configura‐tion files and the running version of the configuration file because jobs must be upda‐ted in order to pick up the changes.Include configuration files and binaries in the same MPM package. For projects with few configuration files or projects where the files (or a subset of files) change with each release cycle, the configuration files can be included in the MPM package with the binaries. While this strategy limits flexibility by binding the binary and configura‐tion files tightly, it simplifies deployment, because it only requires installing one package.Package configuration files into MPM “configuration packages.” We can apply the her‐metic principle to configuration management. Binary configurations tend to be tightly bound to particular versions of binaries, so we leverage the build and packag‐ing systems to snapshot and release configuration files alongside their binaries. Simi‐lar to our treatment of binaries, we can use the build ID to reconstruct the configuration at a specific point in time.For example, a change that implements a new feature can be released with a flag set‐ting that configures that feature. By generating two MPM packages, one for the binary and one for the configuration, we retain the ability to change each package independently. That is, if the feature was released with a flag setting of first_folio but we realize it should instead be bad_quarto, we can cherry pick that change onto the release branch, rebuild the configuration package, and deploy it. This approach has the advantage of not requiring a new binary build.We can leverage MPM’s labeling feature to indicate which versions of MPM packages should be installed together. A label of much_ado can be applied to the MPM packages described in the previous paragraph, which allows us to fetch both packages using this label. When a new version of the project is built, the much_ado label will be applied to the new packages. Because these tags are unique within the namespace for an MPM package, only the latest package with that tag will be used.Read configuration files from an external store. Some projects have configuration files that need to change frequently or dynamically (i.e., while the binary is running). These files can be stored in Chubby, Bigtable, or our source-based filesystem [Kem11].
In summary, project owners consider the different options for distributing and man‐aging configuration files and decide which works best on a case-by-case basis.94  |  Chapter 8: Release Engineering
Conclusions
While this chapter has specifically discussed Google’s approach to release engineering and the ways in which release engineers work and collaborate with SREs, these practi‐ces can also be applied more widely.
It’s Not Just for Googlers
When equipped with the right tools, proper automation, and well-defined policies, developers and SREs shouldn’t have to worry about releasing software. Releases can be as painless as simply pressing a button.Most companies deal with the same set of release engineering problems regardless of their size or the tools they use: How should you handle versioning of your packages? Should you use a continuous build and deploy model, or perform periodic builds? How often should you release? What configuration management policies should you use? What release metrics are of interest?Google Release Engineers have developed our own tools out of necessity because open sourced or vendor-supplied tools don’t work at the scale we require. Custom tools allow us to include functionality to support (and even enforce) release process policies. However, these policies must first be defined in order to add appropriate fea‐tures to our tools, and all companies should take the effort to define their release pro‐cesses whether or not the processes can be automated and/or enforced.Start Release Engineering at the Beginning
Release engineering has often been an afterthought, and this way of thinking must change as platforms and services continue to grow in size and complexity.
Teams should budget for release engineering resources at the beginning of the prod‐uct development cycle. It’s cheaper to put good practices and process in place early, rather than have to retrofit your system later.It is essential that the developers, SREs, and release engineers work together. The release engineer needs to understand the intention of how the code should be built and deployed. The developers shouldn’t build and “throw the results over the fence”to be handled by the release engineers.Individual project teams decide when release engineering becomes involved in a project. Because release engineering is still a relatively young discipline, managers don’t always plan and budget for release engineering in the early stages of a project. Therefore, when considering how to incorporate release engineering practices, be sure that you consider its role as applied to the entire lifecycle of your product or ser‐vice—particularly the early stages.Conclusions  |  95
