It appears that you're experiencing issues with routing in Safari 10. Specifically, the following code is not functioning as expected:

```javascript
onClick={() => route.push(tab.href, tab.href, { shallow: true })}
```

Additionally, navigating back to the home page is also not working. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this issue. Here are a few steps you can take to diagnose and potentially resolve the problem:

1. **Check for Console Errors:**
   - Open the developer tools in Safari (you can do this by pressing `Cmd + Opt + I`).
   - Go to the "Console" tab and check for any errors or warnings that might provide more context about what's going wrong.

2. **Verify Route Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the `tab.href` value is correctly formatted and matches the expected path.
   - Double-check your route configuration to make sure the paths are set up correctly.

3. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Make sure that all of your dependencies, including the routing library, are up to date.
   - If you are using a specific version of the routing library, check if there are known issues with Safari 10 compatibility.

4. **Simplify the Code:**
   - Try simplifying the `onClick` handler to see if the issue persists:
     ```javascript
     onClick={() => route.push(tab.href)}
     ```

5. **Test in Other Browsers:**
   - Verify if the issue is specific to Safari 10 or if it occurs in other browsers as well.
   - This can help determine if the problem is browser-specific or related to your code.

6. **Check for Known Issues:**
   - Look for any known issues or limitations with Safari 10 and the routing library you are using.
   - You may find relevant information on the library's GitHub issues page or in their documentation.

If you provide more details about your setup, such as the routing library you are using and any error messages, I can offer more specific guidance.
