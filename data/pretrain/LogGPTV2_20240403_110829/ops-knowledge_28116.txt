### Scenario and Requirements

I have developed a Python desktop application (using Python 2.5) to monitor the status of services and databases on the same machine where the application is running. The application needs to be extended to monitor two "sibling" Windows Server 2003 hosts. One host is in my local LAN, and the other is in a different LAN accessible via a VPN.

### Current Application Structure

The application consists of:
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI.py)**: Provides widgets for user input and launches the business-logic script.
2. **Business-Logic Script (console.py)**: Invokes slave Python scripts to check the system's services and database usage/accounts. The results are then returned to the GUI.

### Desired Architecture

To avoid running the application directly on each machine, I want to convert it into a client-server application where:
- Users run `gui.py` locally.
- `gui.py` communicates parameters to server instances of `console.py` running on both Windows hosts.
- The servers execute the system checks and report the results back to the client GUI, which displays them.

### Considered Solutions

1. **Windows Service**:
   - Create a Windows service on each host that runs `console.py` and waits for incoming requests from the clients.
   - **Constraints**: I do not have administrative privileges to install services on the Windows hosts.

2. **SSH Connections**:
   - Open SSH connections from any LAN host to the target Windows host and run `console.py` directly.
   - **Constraints**: Many network protocols, including SSH, are filtered by the corporate firewall.

### Constraints

- **Network Protocols**: Many protocols, such as SSH, are blocked by the corporate firewall.
- **Administrative Privileges**: I do not have administrative privileges on the Windows hosts, so I cannot install system services.

### Possible Solution

I discovered a potential solution by leveraging the fact that `console.py` invokes multiple slave Python scripts, each performing a single system check using standard third-party command-line tools. These tools can be configured to check features on remote hosts.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Modify `gui.py` and `console.py`**:
   - Allow users to specify the target Windows host for the checks.
   - Modify `console.py` to pass the target host information to the slave scripts.

2. **Distribute the Application**:
   - Users can now specify which Windows host to monitor, and the application will perform the checks remotely.

### Example Configuration

- **gui.py**:
  ```python
  # gui.py
  import subprocess

  def start_monitoring(target_host):
      # Launch console.py with the target host as an argument
      subprocess.run(['python', 'console.py', target_host])

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      target_host = input("Enter the target host: ")
      start_monitoring(target_host)
  ```

- **console.py**:
  ```python
  # console.py
  import sys
  import subprocess

  def main():
      target_host = sys.argv[1]
      # Invoke slave scripts with the target host
      subprocess.run(['python', 'slave_script_1.py', target_host])
      subprocess.run(['python', 'slave_script_2.py', target_host])
      # ... more slave scripts

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

- **Slave Script Example (slave_script_1.py)**:
  ```python
  # slave_script_1.py
  import sys
  import subprocess

  def check_service_status(target_host):
      # Use a third-party tool to check the service status on the target host
      result = subprocess.run(['third_party_tool', '--host', target_host, '--check-service'], capture_output=True, text=True)
      print(result.stdout)

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      target_host = sys.argv[1]
      check_service_status(target_host)
  ```

### Conclusion

This approach allows me to create a distributed application without requiring administrative privileges or using blocked network protocols. However, this solution relies on the third-party command-line tools supporting remote host feature checking. If this is not possible, alternative methods would need to be explored.

If anyone has additional suggestions or alternative approaches, I would greatly appreciate your input. Thank you in advance!
