Advanced Wireless Attacks Against Enterprise Networks 
Target Identification Within A Red Team Environment

We have now identified six unique ESSIDs present at the client site. We can cross reference these 
ESSIDs with the results of similar site surveys performed at nearby client sites. Suppose we know 
of another Evil Corp branch office 30 miles away. After driving to the secondary location, we 
discover that none of the third-party entities located at the first branch office are present. 
Suppose that after decloaking hidden networks, we see that the following access points are 
within range.

Out of the ESSIDs shown above, the ones that are highlighted in red were also found at the first 
Evil Corp location that we visited. Given the lack of common third-parties present at each of the 
sites, this is very strong evidence that these ESSIDs are used by Evil Corp, and are therefore in-
scope. 
Expanding The Scope By Identifying Sequential BSSIDs  
Let’s return to the first client site. Notice that the BSSIDs outlined in red increment sequentially. 
As previously mentioned, this usually occurs when the APs are part of the same network. We 
know that EC7293 is in-scope (we confirmed this using geographic cross-referencing). Given that 
the access points serving EC7293 and ECwnet1 are part of the same group of sequentially 
incrementing BSSIDs, we can conclude they are both parts of the same network. Therefore, it 
follows that ECwnet1 is in-scope as well.
