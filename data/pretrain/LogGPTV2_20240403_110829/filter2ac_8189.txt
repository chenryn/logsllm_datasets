**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Gatekeeper Bypass

Adversaries may modify file attributes to bypass Gatekeeper, thereby evading user prompts and executing untrusted programs. Gatekeeper is a key component of Apple's security model, designed to ensure that only trusted applications are executed on a host. It was introduced in macOS Snow Leopard (version 10.6, released in 2009) as an enhancement to the existing File Quarantine feature. Over time, Gatekeeper has evolved to incorporate additional security measures, including code signing, compliance with security policies, and notarization.

Gatekeeper distinguishes between applications that are being run for the first time and those that have been previously opened. This differentiation is part of its mechanism to enhance security and user trust.
