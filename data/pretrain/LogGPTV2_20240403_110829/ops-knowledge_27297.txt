User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Set up a linux shell script cron job on Plesk 9.5.4 Operating system    Linux 2.6.18-028stab089.1
Parallels Plesk Panel version   9.5.4  

Set up a test cron job in Settings>Scheduled Tasks>user "root">
*  *   *   *   *   /var/www/cron/webcrontest.sh &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
The script contains this: 

#!/bin/sh
echo "test" &gt;&gt;/var/www/cron/webcrontest.log


However, nothing gets output in that file.
How could I find out what's the problem? I have no access to the e-mail that the cron jobs could be sent to (not my host, trying to set up a cron job for a client because he doesn't listen when I say it's the sysadmins job).

Assistant: You are discarding any diagnostic information you might have by sending stdout &amp; stderr to /dev/null (&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1).

Try redirecting the output to a file and seeing what it contains

* * * * * /var/www/cron/webcrontest.sh &amp;&gt;/tmp/webcrontest.out


Which will write stdout and stderr to /tmp/webcrontest.out.

Edit: From the comments, you have DOS line endings, use dos2unix to remove the ^M line endings

dos2unix /var/www/cron/webcrontest.sh
