# ðŸš€ Feature request
Thanks a lot for releasing LXMERT model. In the LXMERT model code samples, the
visual feature extraction code (using generalized faster-rcnn: modeling_frcnn)
only in the inference step is given. However, the visual feature extraction
during the training phase is not given. For this reason if we use the same
code for fine-tuning, it raises NotImplementedError as the visual feature
extraction during training is not implemented. Is it possible to share the
visual feature extraction during training?
