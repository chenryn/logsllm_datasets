### Feature Request: Visual Feature Extraction During Training for LXMERT Model

Thank you for releasing the LXMERT model. We appreciate the provided code samples, particularly the visual feature extraction code using generalized Faster R-CNN (modeling_frcnn) for the inference step. However, we noticed that the code for visual feature extraction during the training phase is not included.

When attempting to use the same code for fine-tuning, we encountered a `NotImplementedError` because the visual feature extraction during training is not implemented. 

Could you please provide the code or documentation for visual feature extraction during the training phase? This would greatly enhance the usability and flexibility of the LXMERT model for our fine-tuning needs.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
