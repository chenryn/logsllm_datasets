It is important to recognize that the controls in this section do not provide specific contracting 
language. Acquirers should use this publication as guidance to develop their own contracting 
language with specific C-SCRM requirements for inclusion. The following sections expand upon 
the supplier, developer, system integrator, external system service provider, and other ICT/OT-
related service provider roles with respect to C-SCRM expectations for acquirers.  
Enterprises may use multiple techniques to ascertain whether these controls are in place, such as 
supplier self-assessment, acquirer review, or third-party assessments for measurement and 
adherence to the enterprise’s requirements. Enterprises should first look to established third-party 
assessments to see if they meet their needs. When an enterprise defines C-SCRM requirements, it 
may discover that established third-party assessments may not address all specific requirements. 
In this case, additional evidence may be needed to justify unaddressed requirements. Please note 
that the data obtained for this purpose should be appropriately protected. 
SUPPLIERS 
Suppliers may provide either commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or, in federal contexts, 
government off-the-shelf (GOTS) solutions to the acquirer. COTS solutions include non-
developmental items (NDI), such as commercially-licensed solutions/products. GOTS solutions 
are government-only licensable solutions. Suppliers are a diverse group that ranges from very 
small to large, specialized to diversified, and based in a single country to transnational. Suppliers 
also range widely in their level of sophistication, resources, and transparency/visibility into their 
processes and solutions.  
Suppliers have diverse levels and types of C-SCRM practices in place. These practices and other 
related practices may provide the requisite evidence for SCRM evaluation. An example of a 
federal resource that may be leveraged is the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) 
accreditation for trusted suppliers. When appropriate, allow suppliers the opportunity to reuse 
any existing data and documentation that may provide evidence of C-SCRM implementation.  
Enterprises should consider whether the cost of doing business with suppliers may be directly 
impacted by the extent of supply chain cybersecurity requirements imposed on suppliers, the 
willingness or ability of suppliers to allow visibility into how their products are developed or 
manufactured, and how they apply security and supply chain practices to their solutions. When 
enterprises or system integrators require greater levels of transparency from suppliers, they must 
consider the possible cost implications of such requirements. Suppliers may opt not to participate 
in procurements to avoid increased costs or perceived risks to their intellectual property, limiting 
an enterprise’s supply or technology choices. Additionally, suppliers may face risks from 
customers imposing multiple and different sets of supply chain cybersecurity requirements with 
which the supplier must comply on a per-customer basis. The amount of transparency required 
from suppliers should be commensurate to the suppliers’ criticality, which is sufficient to address 
inherent risk.    
DEVELOPERS AND MANUFACTURERS 
Developers and manufactures are personnel that develop or manufacture systems, system 
components (e.g., software), or system services (e.g., Application Programming Interfaces 
NIST SP 800-161r1

[APIs]). Development can occur internally within enterprises or through external entities. 
Developers typically maintain privileged access rights and play an essential role throughout the 
SDLC. The activities they perform and the work they produce can either enhance security or 
introduce new vulnerabilities. It is therefore essential that developers are both subject to and 
intimately familiar with C-SCRM requirements and controls. 
SYSTEM INTEGRATORS 
System integrators provide customized services to the acquirer, including custom development, 
test, operations, and maintenance. This group usually replies to a request for proposal from an 
acquirer with a solution or service that is customized to the acquirer’s requirements. Such 
proposals provided by system integrators can include many layers of suppliers and teaming 
arrangements with other vendors or subcontractors. The system integrator should ensure that 
these business entities are vetted and verified with respect to the acquirer’s C-SCRM 
requirements. Because of the level of visibility that can be obtained in the relationship with the 
system integrator, the acquirer has the discretion to require rigorous supplier acceptance criteria 
and any relevant countermeasures to address identified or potential risks.  
EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICE PROVIDERS OF INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES 
Enterprises use external service providers to perform or support some of their mission and 
business functions [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5]. The outsourcing of systems and services creates a 
set of cybersecurity supply chain concerns that reduces the acquirer’s visibility into and control 
of the outsourced functions. Therefore, it requires increased rigor from enterprises in defining C-
SCRM requirements, stating them in procurement agreements, monitoring delivered services, 
and evaluating them for compliance with the stated requirements. Regardless of who performs 
the services, the acquirer is ultimately responsible and accountable for the risk to the enterprise’s 
systems and data that result from the use of these services. Enterprises should implement a set of 
compensating C-SCRM controls to address this risk and work with the mission and business 
process owner or risk executive to accept this risk. A variety of methods may be used to 
communicate and subsequently verify and monitor C-SCRM requirements through such vehicles 
as contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, 
and/or supply chain transactions.  
OTHER ICT/OT-RELATED SERVICE PROVIDERS 
Providers of services can perform a wide range of different functions, ranging from consulting to 
publishing website content to janitorial services. Other ICT/OT-related service providers 
encompass those providers that require physical or logical access to ICT/OT or the use 
technology (e.g., an aerial photographer using a drone to take video/pictures or a security firm 
remotely monitoring a facility using cloud-based video surveillance) as a means of delivering 
their service. As a result of service provider access or use, the potential for cyber supply chain 
risk being introduced to the enterprise rises.    
Operational technology possesses unique operational and security characteristics that necessitate 
the application of specialized skills and capabilities to effectively protect them. Enterprises that 
have significant OT components throughout their enterprise architecture often turn to specialized

service providers for the secure implementation and maintenance of these devices, systems, or 
equipment. Any enterprise or individual providing services that may include authorized access to 
an ICT or OT system should adhere to enterprise C-SCRM requirements. Enterprises should 
apply special scrutiny to ICT/OT-related service providers managing mission-critical and/or 
safety-relevant assets. 
SELECTING, TAILORING, AND IMPLEMENTING C-SCRM SECURITY CONTROLS 
The C-SCRM controls defined in this section should be selected and tailored according to 
individual enterprise needs and environments using the guidance in [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] in 
order to ensure a cost-effective, risk-based approach to providing enterprise-wide C-SCRM. The 
C-SCRM baseline defined in this publication addresses the basic needs of a broad and diverse set 
of constituents. Enterprises must select, tailor, and implement the security controls based on: (i) 
the environments in which enterprise information systems are acquired and operate; (ii) the 
nature of operations conducted by enterprises; (iii) the types of threats facing enterprises, mission 
and business processes, supply chains, and information systems; and (iv) the type of information 
processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems and the supply chain infrastructure. 
After selecting the initial set of security controls, the acquirer should initiate the tailoring process 
according to NIST SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organization, in 
order to appropriately modify and more closely align the selected controls with the specific 
conditions within the enterprise. The tailoring should be coordinated with and approved by the 
appropriate enterprise officials (e.g., authorizing officials, authorizing official designated 
representatives, risk executive [function], chief information officers, or senior information 
security officers) prior to implementing the C-SCRM controls. Additionally, enterprises have the 
flexibility to perform the tailoring process at the enterprise level (either as the required tailored 
baseline or as the starting point for policy-, program-, or system-specific tailoring) in support of 
a specific program at the individual information system level or using a combination of 
enterprise-level, program/mission-level, and system-specific approaches.  
Selection and tailoring decisions, including the specific rationale for those decisions, should be 
included within the C-SCRM documentation at Levels 1, 2, and 3 and Appendix C and approved 
by the appropriate enterprise officials as part of the C-SCRM plan approval process. 
C-SCRM CONTROL FORMAT 
Table A-1 shows the format used in this publication for controls providing supplemental C-
SCRM guidance on existing [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] controls or control enhancements. 
C-SCRM controls that do not have a parent [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] control generally follow 
the format described in [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] with the addition of relevant levels. New 
controls are given identifiers consistent with [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] but do not duplicate 
existing control identifiers.

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Ensure that the information systems and the supply chain have 
appropriate access enforcement mechanisms in place. This includes both physical and logical access 
enforcement mechanisms, which likely work in coordination for supply chain needs. Enterprises should 
ensure a detailed definition of access enforcement.

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS 
 Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Prompt revocation is critical to ensure that suppliers, developers, 
system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers who 
no longer require access or who abuse or violate their access privilege are not able to access an 
enterprise’s system. For example, in a “badge flipping” situation, a contract is transferred from one 
system integrator enterprise to another with the same personnel supporting the contract. In that 
situation, the enterprise should disable the existing accounts, retire the old credentials, establish new 
accounts, and issue completely new credentials.

USING C-SCRM CONTROLS IN THIS PUBLICATION 
The remainder of Section 4 provides the enhanced C-SCRM overlay of NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5. 
This section displays the relationship between NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 controls and C-SCRM 
controls in one of the following ways: 
• If a [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] control or enhancement was determined to be an 
information security control that serves as a foundational control for C-SCRM but is not 
specific to C-SCRM, it is not included in this publication. 
• If a [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] control or enhancement was determined to be relevant to 
C-SCRM, the levels in which the control applies are also provided.  
• If a [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] enhancement was determined to be relevant to C-SCRM 
but the parent control was not, then the parent control number and title are included, but 
there is no supplemental C-SCRM guidance. 
• C-SCRM controls/enhancements that do not have an associated [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 
5] control/enhancement are listed with their titles and the control/enhancement text. 
• All C-SCRM controls include the levels for which the control applies and supplemental 
C-SCRM guidance as applicable. 
• When a control enhancement provides a mechanism for implementing the C-SCRM 
control, the control enhancement is listed within the Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance 
and is not included separately. 
• If [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] already captures withdrawals or reorganization of prior 
[NIST SP 800-161] controls, it is not included. 
The following new controls and control enhancement have been added: 
• The C-SCRM Control MA-8 – Maintenance Monitoring and Information Sharing is 
added to the Maintenance control family 
• 
The C-SCRM Control SR-13 – Supplier Inventory is added to the Supply Chain Risk 
Management control family

C-SCRM SECURITY CONTROLS 
FAMILY: ACCESS CONTROL 
[FIPS 200] specifies the Access Control minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must limit information system access to authorized users, processes 
acting on behalf of authorized users, devices (including other information systems), and 
the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to exercise.  
Systems and components that traverse the supply chain are subject to access by a variety of 
individuals and enterprises, including suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. Such access should be defined 
and managed to ensure that it does not inadvertently result in the unauthorized release, 
modification, or destruction of information. This access should be limited to only the necessary 
type, duration, and level of access for authorized enterprises (and authorized individuals within 
those enterprises) and monitored for cybersecurity supply chain impact.  
AC-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should specify and include in agreements (e.g., contracting 
language) access control policies for their suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service 
providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers that have access control policies. These should 
include both physical and logical access to the supply chain and the information system. Enterprises should 
require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-
tier contractors.   
Level(s): 1, 2, 3 
AC-2 
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Use of this control helps establish traceability of actions and actors in 
the supply chain. This control also helps ensure access authorizations of actors in the supply chain is 
appropriate on a continuous basis. The enterprise may choose to define a set of roles and associate a level 
of authorization to ensure proper implementation. Enterprises must ensure that accounts for contractor 
personnel do not exceed the period of performance of the contract. Privileged accounts should only be 
established for appropriately vetted contractor personnel. Enterprises should also have processes in place to 
establish and manage temporary or emergency accounts for contractor personnel that require access to a 
mission-critical or mission-enabling system during a continuity or emergency event. For example, during a 
pandemic event, existing contractor personnel who are not able to work due to illness may need to be 
temporarily backfilled by new contractor staff. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to 
implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and 
agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 
14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

AC-3 
ACCESS ENFORCEMENT 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Ensure that the information systems and the supply chain have 
appropriate access enforcement mechanisms in place. This includes both physical and logical access 
enforcement mechanisms, which likely work in coordination for supply chain needs. Enterprises should 
ensure that a defined consequence framework is in place to address access control violations. Enterprises 
should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant 
sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in 
accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.  
Level(s): 2, 3 
Control Enhancement(s): 
ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Prompt revocation is critical to ensure that suppliers, developers, 
system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers who 
no longer require access or who abuse or violate their access privilege are not able to access an 
enterprise’s system. Enterprises should include in their agreements a requirement for contractors and 
sub-tier contractors to immediately return access credentials (e.g., tokens, PIV or CAC cards, etc.) to 
the enterprise. Enterprises must also have processes in place to promptly process the revocation of 
access authorizations. For example, in a “badge flipping” situation, a contract is transferred from one 
system integrator enterprise to another with the same personnel supporting the contract. In that 
situation, the enterprise should disable the existing accounts, retire the old credentials, establish new 
accounts, and issue completely new credentials.    
Level(s): 2, 3 
ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | CONTROLLED RELEASE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Information about the supply chain should be controlled for release 
between the enterprise and third parties. Information may be exchanged between the enterprise and its 
suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers. The controlled release of enterprise information protects against risks associated 
with disclosure. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
AC-4 
INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT 
Supplemental C- SCRM Guidance: Supply chain information may traverse a large supply chain to a broad 
set of stakeholders, including the enterprise and its various federal stakeholders, suppliers, developers, 
system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. 
Specifying the requirements and how information flow is enforced should ensure that only the required 
information is communicated to various participants in the supply chain. Enterprises should require their 
prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. 
Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with 
Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

Control Enhancement(s): 
INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | METADATA  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The metadata relevant to C-SCRM is extensive and includes 
activities within the SDLC. For example, information about systems and system components, 
acquisition details, and delivery is considered metadata and may require appropriate protections. 
Enterprises should identify what metadata is directly relevant to their supply chain security and ensure 
that information flow enforcement is implemented in order to protect applicable metadata. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DOMAIN AUTHENTICATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Within the C-SCRM context, enterprises should specify various 
source and destination points for information about the supply chain and information that flows 
through the supply chain. This is so that enterprises have visibility of information flow within the 
supply chain.  
Level(s): 2, 3 
INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | VALIDATION OF METADATA 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: For C-SCRM, the validation of data and the relationship to its 
metadata are critical. Much of the data transmitted through the supply chain is validated with the 
verification of the associated metadata that is bound to it. Ensure that proper filtering and inspection is 
put in place for validation before allowing payloads into the supply chain. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PHYSICAL OR LOGICAL SEPARATION OF INFORMATION FLOWS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should ensure the separation of the information 
system and supply chain information36 flow. Various mechanisms can be implemented, such as 
encryption methods (e.g., digital signing). Addressing information flow between the enterprise and its 
suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers may be challenging, especially when leveraging public networks. 
Level(s): 3 
AC-5 
SEPARATION OF DUTIES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should ensure that an appropriate separation of duties is 
established for decisions that require the acquisition of both information system and supply chain 
components. The separation of duties helps to ensure that adequate protections are in place for components 
entering the enterprise’s supply chain, such as denying developers the privilege to promote code that they 
wrote from development to production environments. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to 
implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and 
agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order
