### Key Points

1. **Contracting Language**:
   - The controls in this section do not provide specific contracting language. Acquirers should use this publication as guidance to develop their own contracting language with specific C-SCRM requirements for inclusion.

2. **Verification Techniques**:
   - Enterprises may use multiple techniques to verify if these controls are in place, such as supplier self-assessment, acquirer review, or third-party assessments.
   - Established third-party assessments should be considered first. If they do not meet all specific requirements, additional evidence may be needed. Data obtained for this purpose should be appropriately protected.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Suppliers
- **Types of Solutions**:
  - Suppliers provide either commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or government off-the-shelf (GOTS) solutions.
  - COTS solutions include non-developmental items (NDI), such as commercially-licensed products.
  - GOTS solutions are government-only licensable solutions.
- **Diversity**:
  - Suppliers range from very small to large, specialized to diversified, and can be based in a single country or transnational.
  - They vary in sophistication, resources, and transparency into their processes and solutions.
- **C-SCRM Practices**:
  - Suppliers have diverse levels and types of C-SCRM practices in place, which may provide the requisite evidence for SCRM evaluation.
  - Federal resources like the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) accreditation for trusted suppliers can be leveraged.
- **Cost Implications**:
  - The cost of doing business with suppliers may be directly impacted by the extent of supply chain cybersecurity requirements imposed on them.
  - Suppliers may opt out of procurements to avoid increased costs or risks to their intellectual property, limiting an enterprise’s supply or technology choices.
  - Suppliers may face challenges in complying with multiple and different sets of supply chain cybersecurity requirements from various customers.

#### Developers and Manufacturers
- **Role**:
  - Develop or manufacture systems, system components (e.g., software), or system services (e.g., APIs).
  - Development can occur internally within enterprises or through external entities.
- **Access and Security**:
  - Developers typically maintain privileged access rights and play a critical role throughout the SDLC.
  - It is essential that developers are subject to and familiar with C-SCRM requirements and controls.

#### System Integrators
- **Services**:
  - Provide customized services, including custom development, testing, operations, and maintenance.
  - Respond to requests for proposals with solutions or services tailored to the acquirer’s requirements.
- **Supplier Vetting**:
  - Ensure that business entities involved in the solution are vetted and verified with respect to the acquirer’s C-SCRM requirements.
  - Acquirers have the discretion to require rigorous supplier acceptance criteria and countermeasures to address identified or potential risks.

#### External System Service Providers
- **Outsourcing**:
  - Enterprises use external service providers to perform or support mission and business functions.
  - Outsourcing creates cybersecurity supply chain concerns, reducing the acquirer’s visibility and control over outsourced functions.
- **Risk Management**:
  - Requires increased rigor in defining C-SCRM requirements, stating them in procurement agreements, monitoring delivered services, and evaluating compliance.
  - The acquirer is ultimately responsible and accountable for the risk to the enterprise’s systems and data.
  - Implement compensating C-SCRM controls and work with the mission and business process owner or risk executive to accept the risk.

#### Other ICT/OT-Related Service Providers
- **Functions**:
  - Perform a wide range of functions, from consulting to publishing website content to janitorial services.
  - Include providers that require physical or logical access to ICT/OT or use technology to deliver their services.
- **Risk Considerations**:
  - Access or use by service providers can introduce cyber supply chain risks.
  - Operational technology (OT) has unique operational and security characteristics, necessitating specialized skills and capabilities.
  - Special scrutiny should be applied to ICT/OT-related service providers managing mission-critical and/or safety-relevant assets.

### Selecting, Tailoring, and Implementing C-SCRM Security Controls

1. **Selection and Tailoring**:
   - C-SCRM controls should be selected and tailored according to individual enterprise needs and environments using the guidance in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5.
   - The C-SCRM baseline addresses the basic needs of a broad and diverse set of constituents.
   - Enterprises must select, tailor, and implement the security controls based on:
     - Environments in which information systems are acquired and operate.
     - Nature of operations conducted by enterprises.
     - Types of threats facing enterprises, mission and business processes, supply chains, and information systems.
     - Type of information processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems and the supply chain infrastructure.

2. **Tailoring Process**:
   - After selecting the initial set of security controls, the acquirer should initiate the tailoring process according to NIST SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organization.
   - Tailoring should be coordinated with and approved by appropriate enterprise officials (e.g., authorizing officials, risk executives, chief information officers, or senior information security officers).

3. **Documentation and Approval**:
   - Selection and tailoring decisions, including the rationale, should be included in the C-SCRM documentation at Levels 1, 2, and 3 and Appendix C.
   - Documentation should be approved by the appropriate enterprise officials as part of the C-SCRM plan approval process.

### C-SCRM Control Format

- **Table A-1**: Shows the format used for controls providing supplemental C-SCRM guidance on existing NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 controls or control enhancements.
