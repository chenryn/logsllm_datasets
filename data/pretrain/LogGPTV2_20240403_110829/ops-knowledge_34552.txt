User: I have installed Cygwin Terminal in OS Windows. But I need to install also python and make in cygwin.All of these programs are needed to run petsc library.
Does Someone know how to install these components in cygwin?
Assistant: Look into cygwin native package manager, devel category. You should find make and python there.
