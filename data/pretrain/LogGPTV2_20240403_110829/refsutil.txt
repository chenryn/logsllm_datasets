ReFSUtil
Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows 10
ReFSUtil is a tool included in Windows and Windows Server that attempts to diagnose heavily damaged ReFS volumes, identify remaining files, and copy those files to another volume. This tool comes in the %SystemRoot%\Windows\System32 folder.
%SystemRoot%\Windows\System32
ReFS salvage is the primary function of ReFSUtil, and is useful for recovering data from volumes that show as RAW in Disk Management. ReFS Salvage has two phases: Scan Phase and a Copy Phase. In automatic mode, the Scan Phase and Copy Phase will run sequentially. In manual
mode, each phase can be run separately. Progress and logs are saved in a working directory to allow phases to be run separately as well as Scan Phase to be paused and resumed. You shouldn't need to use the ReFSutil tool unless the volume is RAW. If read-only, then data is still accessible.
Parameters
Parameter
Description
Specifies the ReFS volume to process. The drive letter must be formatted as "L:", or you must provide a path to the volume mount point.
Specifies the location to store temporary information and logs. It must not be located on the .
Specifies the location where identified files are copied to. It must not be located on the .
-m
Recovers all possible files including deleted ones.WARNING: Not only does this parameter cause the process to take longer to run, but it can also lead to unexpected results.
-v
Specifies to use verbose mode.
-x
Forces the volume to dismount first, if necessary. All opened handles to the volume are then invalid. For example, refsutil salvage -QA R: N:\WORKING N:\DATA -x.
WARNING: Not only does this parameter cause the process to take longer to run, but it can also lead to unexpected results.
refsutil salvage -QA R: N:\WORKING N:\DATA -x
Usage and available options
Quick automatic mode
Performs a Quick Scan Phase followed by a Copy Phase. This mode runs quicker as it assumes some critical structures of the volume aren't corrupted and so there's no need to scan the entire volume to locate them. This also reduces the recovery of stale files/directories/volumes.
refsutil salvage -QA    
Full automatic mode
Performs a Full Scan Phase followed by a Copy Phase. This mode may take a long time as it will scan the entire volume for any recoverable files/directories/volumes.
refsutil salvage -FA    
Diagnose phase (manual mode)
First, try to determine if the  is an ReFS volume and determine if the volume is mountable. If a volume isn't mountable, the reason(s) will be provided. This is a standalone phase.
refsutil salvage -D   
Quick Scan phase
Performs a Quick Scan of the  for any recoverable files. This mode runs quicker as it assumes some critical structures of the volume aren't corrupted and so there's no need to scan the entire volume to locate them. This also reduces the recovery of stale files/directories/volumes. Discovered files are logged to the foundfiles..txt file, located in your . If the Scan Phase was previously stopped, running with the -QS flag again resumes the scan from where it left off.
foundfiles..txt
refsutil salvage -QS   
Full Scan phase
Scans the entire  for any recoverable files. This mode may take a long time as it will scan the entire volume for any recoverable files. Discovered files will be logged to the foundfiles..txt file, located in your . If the Scan Phase was previously stopped, running with the -FS flag again resumes the scan from where it left off.
foundfiles..txt
refsutil salvage -FS   
Copy phase
Copies all files described in the foundfiles..txt file to your . If you stop the Scan Phase too early, it's possible that the foundfiles..txt file might not yet exist, so no file is copied to the .
foundfiles..txt
foundfiles..txt
refsutil salvage -C    
Copy phase with list
Copies all the files in the  from the  to your . The files in the  must have first been identified by the Scan Phase, though the scan need not have been run to completion. The  can be generated by copying foundfiles..txt to a new file, removing lines referencing files that shouldn't be restored, and preserving files that should be restored. The PowerShell cmdlet Select-String may be helpful in filtering foundfiles..txt to only include desired paths, extensions, or file names.
foundfiles..txt
foundfiles..txt
refsutil salvage -SL     
Copy phase with interactive console
Advanced users can salvage files using an interactive console. This mode also requires files generated from either of the Scan Phases.
refsutil salvage -IC
