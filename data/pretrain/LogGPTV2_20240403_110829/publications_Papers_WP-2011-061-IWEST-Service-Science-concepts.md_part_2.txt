### Directed at IT Professionals: Development of iOS-Based Services and the ISE Workbench

For the development of iOS-based services, the Integrated Service Engineering (ISE) Methodology [6] was proposed and implemented as the ISE Workbench [7-8]. The ISE Workbench includes a total of 20 editors for modeling services (Figure 2). This tool is well-suited for highly qualified engineers, IT professionals, and technical personnel but is not adequate for non-IT users and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

### Need for New Tools: gUSDL Design Application

To address the needs of non-IT users and SMEs, there is a requirement to develop new tools that implement the gUSDL graphical specification language (see Section 3) and provide an intuitive environment for service design. The gUSDL Design application will enable the creation of services that can be automatically transferred to a compliant service marketplace (see Section 5).

### Understanding Non-IT Professionals

To achieve this goal, it is essential to gain a deep understanding of non-IT professionals, their needs, work, and context. Focus groups and workshops should be conducted to gather input from stakeholders and discuss requirements. Instead of merely evaluating usability against guidelines, a more holistic and systematic approach is recommended. This involves using task analysis frameworks and both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping to capture non-IT professional requirements.

#### Key Activities:

1. **Tool Requirements:**
   - Identify relevant functionalities.
   - Define fine-grained data requirements for service specification.
   - Understand environmental and non-IT professional profiles.
   - Gather usability requirements from non-IT users for the gUSDL Design tool.

2. **Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA):**
   - Break down the activities associated with describing a business service into subtasks.
   - Focus on the physical and observable actions performed by non-IT professionals from SMEs.
   - Translate these actions into functionalities.

3. **Low-Fidelity and High-Fidelity Prototyping:**
   - Use low-fidelity prototypes to explore alternative designs quickly and easily.
   - Use high-fidelity prototypes to provide a close visual representation of the final gUSDL Design tool.

### Validation of the gUSDL Design Tool

The gUSDL Design tool must be validated by modeling several sets of services representing different classes. Ideally, the same services used to validate the graphical language in Section 3 should be re-used to ensure consistency.

### One-Click Service Marketplace

Once services are designed using the gUSDL Design tool, the service specifications need to be uploaded to a service marketplace. This marketplace will bring consumers and providers (e.g., SMEs) together through a centralized channel.

While marketplaces exist for large companies, simpler prototypes are needed to ensure non-professional users can interact comfortably with such a platform. Currently, there is a lack of formalization for non-technical aspects of services, such as pricing, benefits, quality of service, or legal requirements (see USDL specification for a complete list). Therefore, structured information must be included in service marketplaces using rich knowledge representation structures, such as ontologies [25].

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Marketplace Architecture:**
   - Develop an architecture for a service marketplace ecosystem with loosely coupled modules for identity management, billing, bundling, rating, SLA compliance, and integration with social networks for CRM and service delivery platforms.

2. **Service Archive (SAR):**
   - Create a SAR for SME services, which includes all necessary resources (e.g., USDL files, BPEL files, PDF files, HTML files, Java class files, XML files) to trade a service in a marketplace.

3. **Semantic Search Mechanism:**
   - Implement semantic search mechanisms that leverage semantic Web theories. Annotate business services' properties with concepts from classification schemas and taxonomies (e.g., UNSPSC) to develop efficient and effective search algorithms.

### Validation and Usability Testing

The service marketplace should be validated using modern approaches. At this stage, experts and non-IT professionals from SMEs should be involved in expert-based evaluations, such as cognitive walkthroughs, to assess the intuitiveness of using the service marketplace.

### Comprehensive Service Use Cases Set

There is a need for a systematic validation of the languages, methodologies, and tools proposed for the IoS. For example, USDL provides only a few examples of its use and the ISE engineering workbench. Identifying recurring use cases and patterns in various business models, industries, and companies will help non-IT professionals and SMEs learn from examples and apply existing service solutions to their businesses.

**Key Activities:**

1. **Scenario Creation:**
   - Use the vocabulary and phrasing of SME users to create understandable scenarios for service trading, consumption, and provisioning.

2. **Service Storyboarding:**
   - Develop storyboards to show how non-IT users might handle a service using gUSDL, the gUSDL Designer, and the service Marketplace.

3. **Documentation Studying:**
   - Study documentation to identify characteristics, procedures, and rules often written in manuals.

4. **Expert Meetings:**
   - Conduct meetings with industry partners and research partners from economics, psychology, law, and management to identify fundamental aspects of service design.

### Conclusions

The Internet of Services (IoS) has gained renewed importance following the European Parliament's approval of a significant service directive aimed at enhancing competition by removing cross-border market access restrictions for services in Europe. Within the IoS, services will be created and operated using systematic approaches, methodologies, standards, and tools, enabling their trading over the Internet via emerging service marketplaces.

To provide a suitable infrastructure for SMEs to trade business services, four challenges need to be addressed:

1. **Intuitive Graphical Representation Language:**
   - Provide a graphical language to describe services.

2. **Easy-to-Use Design Tool:**
   - Develop a user-friendly tool for designing services.

3. **One-Click Service Marketplace:**
   - Create a marketplace for trading services.

4. **Comprehensive Use Cases:**
   - Compile a set of use cases to document and illustrate how SMEs can describe, design, advertise, and trade services using a one-click marketplace.

Achieving these objectives will enable non-IT professionals from SMEs to access practical solutions and actively participate in the IoS, driving a new "service industry" for provisioning, brokering, reselling, and operating business services.
