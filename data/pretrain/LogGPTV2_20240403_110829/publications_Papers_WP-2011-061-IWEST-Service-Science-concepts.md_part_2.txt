directed at IT professionals. For the development of IoS-based services, the Integrated
Service Engineering (ISE) Methodology [6] was proposed and implemented as the
ISE Workbench [7-8]. The ISE Workbench embodies a total number of 20 editors to
model services (Fig. 2). Clearly, the tool is suitable for highly qualified engineers, IT
professionals and technical people but inadequate for non-IT users and SME.

Therefore, there is the need to develop new tools which implement the gUSDL
graphical specification language (see section 3) and provide an intuitive environment
Service Science: concepts, tools and platforms to support digital services for SME 7
for services. The tool, a gUSDL Design application, provides an environment to
design services which can later be automatically transferred to a compliant service
marketplace (see section 5).
To accomplish this goal, there is the need to understand as much as possible about
non-IT professionals, their needs, their work, and the context of their work, so that the
gUSDL Design tool can support them effectively in designing business services for
SME. Focus groups and workshops need to be carried out to get a group of
stakeholders together to discuss issues and requirements. Rather than purely
evaluating usability against guidelines, we argue that designing service-based
descriptions for SME will benefit from a more holistic and systematic approach.
Namely, by relying on task analysis frameworks, and low-fidelity and high fidelity
prototyping to capture a view on non-IT professional requirements. Important
activities include:
─ Tool requirements. A first objective needs to identify a set of relevant
functionalities, fine-grained data requirements for service specification,
environmental and non-IT professional profiles, and usability requirements from
non-IT users for the gUSDL Design tool.
─ Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA). HTA can be used to break the activities
associated with describing a business service down into subtasks. This will
enable to focuses on the physical and observable actions performed by non-IT
professionals from SME and translate the actions into functionalities.
─ Low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping. Since they are simple and quick to
produce and modify, low-fidelity prototypes enable the exploration of
alternative designs for the gUSDL Design tool constructed based on the ideas
provided by non-IT professionals. High-fidelity prototypes provide a close
visual representation of the final gUSDL Design tool.
The gUSDL Design tool also needs to be validated by modeling several sets of
services that represent distinct classes of services. Ideally, to preserve consistency
across validations, the services used to validate the graphical language described in
section 3 can be re-used to validate the gUSDL Design.
5 One-click service marketplace
Once services are designed using a gUSDL Design tool, service specifications need to
be uploaded for advertisement in a service marketplace. This service marketplace will
bring consumers and providers (e.g. SME) together in a “one-stop” exposure of
business services through a centralized channel.
While marketplaces exist for large companies, for example Software-as-a-Service
initiatives like Salesforce, simpler prototypes are needed to show that non-
professional users are able to interact and feel comfortable with such a platform to
publish and consume services on their own. Currently, there is a lack in formalizing
non-technical aspects of a service, such as pricing, benefits, quality of service or legal
requirements (see USDL specification for a complete list). Therefore, there is the
8 Jorge Cardoso and Paulo Rupino da Cunha
need to include such information in a structured way in service marketplaces by
relying on rich knowledge representation structures, such as ontologies [25], for the
annotation of business services. Hence, ontologies are significant structures for
representing semantics in a generic and formal way [26]. An approach similar to
SAWSDL [27], but applied to USDL, can be a good solution for the IoS. Semantic
annotation languages, like SAWSDL, connect service descriptions with ontological
entities, thus enabling semantic search engine to efficiently and effectively query
them [28].
Messerschmitt [29] provides a good overview of the issues that need to be
considered when developing a marketplace. Additional considerations that need to be
taken care of include:
─ Marketplace architecture. Elaborate an architecture for a service marketplace
ecosystem accounting for loosely coupled modules such as identity
management, billing, bundling, rating, SLA compliance, and integration with
social networks for CRM and integration with service delivery platforms.
─ Service archive. Develop a SAR (Service Archive) for SME services. A SAR is
an entity consisting of one or more resources such as USDL files, BPEL files,
PDF files, HTML files, Java class files, XML files, etc. which contain all the
necessary information to trade a service in a marketplace. Packaging services’
resources into SAR archives makes it easy to reuse and reassemble components
as new services and distribute them to various service marketplaces.
─ Semantic search mechanism. Implement semantic search mechanisms that
capitalize on the use of semantic Web theories. Business services’ properties,
such as the one captured by the business, operational and technical perspective
of USDL, can be annotated with concepts presents in classification schema and
taxonomies (such as UNSPSC). These annotations enable the development of
efficient and effective search algorithms. For SME users and non-IT users this
enables to obtain better results at a lower cost.
The service marketplace needs to be validated using modern approaches and ad hoc
usability testing is not recommended. At this stage, experts and non-IT professional
from SME need to be involved to prepare expert-based evaluations. For example,
cognitive walkthroughs need to be used to evaluate the intuition of using service
marketplaces.
6 Comprehensive service use cases set
So far, there is a lack of a systematic validation of the languages, methodologies and
tools proposed for the IoS. For example, USDL only provides a few examples of the
use of the language and its ISE engineering workbench. Therefore, there is the need to
identify which business models, industries, companies and organizations generate
services which have recurring use cases and patterns. Having a set of use cases and
patterns at hand, non-IT professionals and SME will be able to learn from examples,
and easily and quickly apply existing service solutions to their own business. The
construction of a set of use cases requires an exhaustive exploration of the various
Service Science: concepts, tools and platforms to support digital services for SME 9
dimensions of gUSDL which include, for example, pricing schema, service levels,
strategic partners and alliances, law and cyberlaw, and SLA negotiation. The elements
are to be used to characterize existing services from the industry. Use cases also
provide a consistent, uniform and baseline for the validation of IoS solutions.
Here again, there is the need to rely on contemporary approaches and methods such
as scenarios, storyboarding, cognitive walkthroughs, and case studies to compile a
multi-perspective view on best practices to design, model, advertise, search and
consume SME business services using marketplaces. In particular the following
activities are important:
─ Scenario creation. Using the vocabulary and phrasing of SME users means that
the service trading, service consumptions and service provisioning scenarios can
be understood by non-IT professionals and other stakeholders, and they are able
to participate fully in the development process. In fact, the construction of
scenarios by stakeholders is often the first step in establishing business cases for
other industrial partners’ requirements.
─ Service storyboarding. A storyboard consists of a series of sketches showing
how non-IT users might handle a service using gUSDL, the gUSDL Designer,
and the service Marketplace. When used in conjunction with a scenario, the
storyboard brings more detail to scenarios and offers stakeholders a chance to
role-play with the prototype, interacting with it by stepping through the
scenario.
─ Documentation studying. Studying documentation to identify characteristics,
procedures and rules often written down in manuals is also a good source of
data about the steps involved in a SME service lifecycle.
─ Expert Meetings. Expert meetings need to be conducted with an industry partner
and research partners from the faculty of economics, psychology, law, and
management. The main objective is to identify the fundamental aspects that
make up a service and study how they are typically designed by SME in order to
be made operational.
Services will benefit from the development of domain-specific use cases and
reference models. References models, which are more abstract than domain-specific
architectures, capture a larger class of services and can provide an organizational
structure and organizational principals to service development. A good source of
information for the classification of use cases is the NAICS standard. NAICS has
provision for specific services in the utilities (services such as electricity, heating,
water, and natural gas distribution), finance and insurance (investment and retail
banks, securities industry, stock trading, funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles),
and real estate and rental (real state, rental and leasing services).
7 Conclusions
The research topic of the Internet of Services (IoS) and the concept of service have
acquired a renewed importance since after several years of public debate, the
European Parliament has approved an important service directive. This directive
10 Jorge Cardoso and Paulo Rupino da Cunha
intends to enhance competition by removing restrictions on cross-border market
access for services in Europe. The implications of this measure are significant since
the service sector represents more than 70% of the Gross National Product.
Within the IoS, services will be created and operated relying on a systematic
approach and using proper methodologies, standards, and tools. This will enable their
trading over the Internet using emerging service marketplaces. To provide a suitable
infrastructure for SME to trade business services four challenges need to be addressed
and are discussed in this paper. The first objective targets to provide an intuitive
graphical representation language to describe services. The second objective is to
develop an easy-to-use tool to design services. The third objective targets the
development of a “one-click” service marketplace to trade services. Finally, the fourth
objective is to compile a set of use cases that document and illustrate how SME can
describe, design, advertize, and trade services using a one-click marketplace.
Reaching these four objectives will enable non-IT professionals from SME to have
access to practical solutions and to be an active participant in the IoS. These
developments will give the opportunity to SME to create and drive a new “service
industry” for provisioning, brokering, (re)selling and operating business services.
