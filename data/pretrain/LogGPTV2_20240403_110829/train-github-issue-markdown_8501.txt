Hello everyone,
I have a problem with Chrome extension - React Developer Tools, if I change
component's state it's not changing in the dev tools window (as in the
screenshot below) I am only able to see arrows with title "Reset value".  
Does somebody know how it could be fixed?
Thanks a lot for help!
