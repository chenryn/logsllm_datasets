User: I'm not sure this is possible. Google does not seem to have any answers.
Running Linux Debian can I list all pip packages and size (amount of disk space used) thats installed?
i.e. List all pip packages with size on disk?
Assistant: Here's how,

pip3 show numpy | grep "Location:"
this will return path/to/all/packages
du  -h  path/to/all/packages
last line will contain size of all packages in MB

Note: You may put any package name in place of numpy
