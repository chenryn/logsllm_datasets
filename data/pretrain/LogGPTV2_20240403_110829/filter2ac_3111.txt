### Title: Black Hat US-18: Mainframe [z/OS] Reverse Engineering and Exploit Development

When you speak with any Fortune 500 company that relies on mainframes, they will tell you two things: (1) their business would cease to function without these mainframes, and (2) they do not conduct any security research on them, including vulnerability scans. The most frustrating aspect is that mainframes, despite being different from conventional systems, are still computers and thus susceptible to hacking.

Previous talks on this topic have provided a high-level overview, emphasizing the importance of basic security practices. This talk builds on those discussions by delving into the specifics of mainframe hacking. While earlier presentations covered network penetration testing and privilege escalation, this session will focus on the tools and techniques available for reverse engineering and exploit development on the z/OS platform.

Attendees will be introduced to the various tools that can aid in reverse engineering, such as debuggers like dbx and ASMIDF, and will learn about the challenges associated with using them. Following this, the talk will provide detailed steps for developing your own exploits and buffer overflows on the platform, using languages like C, assembler, and JCL. A demo program will be used to illustrate these concepts, allowing participants to follow along.

Key topics to be covered include:
- APF authorization
- Bypassing RACF/ACEE
- TSO (Time Sharing Option)
- Unix System Services

By the end of the session, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of how to perform reverse engineering and develop exploits on the z/OS mainframe platform.
