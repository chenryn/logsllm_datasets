### Feature Request: Numeric Pixel Size Control for Zones

**Current Functionality:**
Currently, when creating a custom zone, the only method available is through a visual rectangle that can be resized and moved. The default border size is 16 pixels. This approach lacks precision and does not allow for setting explicit dimensions.

**Proposed Enhancement:**
To improve the precision and usability of custom zones, we propose adding the ability to set explicit width and height values. This will enable users to fit fixed-size windows, which is particularly useful for streaming or screen recording purposes.

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Add Numeric Input Fields:**
   - Introduce two text boxes where users can explicitly enter the desired width and height of the zone.
   - These text boxes should also display the current size of the zone in real-time as it is being resized using the mouse.

2. **Dynamic Resizing:**
   - When a user enters specific numeric values for the width and height, the zone should resize to those exact dimensions.
   - Conversely, when the zone is resized using the mouse, the numeric values in the text boxes should update to reflect the current size of the zone.

**Example Workflow:**
- User opens the custom zone creation tool.
- User can either:
  - Enter the desired width and height in the text boxes, and the zone will resize accordingly.
  - Resize the zone using the mouse, and the text boxes will dynamically update to show the current dimensions.

This enhancement will provide more control and flexibility, making it easier to create and manage custom zones for various use cases.
