Allow numeric pixel size control of zones.
currently, when setting a custom zone the only means is by a visual rectangle
which I can resize and move around and the size of the border (16 pixels
default).  
I need to be able to set explicit size for a zone so I can fit fixed size
windows either for streaming or for screen recording purposes.
Add 2 text boxes which will allow me to explicitly enter the zone's width and
height in addition to mouse resize. The numeric text should also show the size
of the current window when resizing with the mouse.
When I enter numeric height / width, the zone will resize accordingly.  
When I resize the zone via mouse, the numeric indicators will show current
size.
