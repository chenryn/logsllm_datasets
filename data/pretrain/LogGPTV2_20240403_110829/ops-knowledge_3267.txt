User: How to use the TCP protocol to realize the connection and data transmission between the client and the server?
Assistant: The TCP protocol is a transmission control protocol that provides reliable data transmission. It realizes the connection and data transmission between the client and the server through the three steps of establishing a connection, transmitting data and releasing the connection. The following are the steps to implement the connection and data transmission between the client and the server using the TCP protocol: 1. The server starts listening and waits for the client to connect. The server uses the socket () function to create a socket, then uses the bind () function to bind it to a specific IP address and port number, and finally uses the listen () function to put it in the listening state. 2. The client creates a socket by calling the socket() function, and then uses the connect() function to connect to the server's IP address and port number. 3. When the client and server are connected, they can communicate through the socket. The client uses the send() function to send data, and the server uses the recv() function to receive data. Both functions are blocked until the data transmission is completed. 4. The client and server can use the close() function to release the connection. The above are the basic steps of using the TCP protocol to realize the connection and data transmission between the client and the server. In practical applications, issues such as error handling, packet loss retransmission, and flow control also need to be considered to ensure data reliability and efficiency.
