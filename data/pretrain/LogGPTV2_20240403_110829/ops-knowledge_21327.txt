User: I have a Scheduled Task on a WinXP SP2 machine that is set up to run a python script:
Daily
Start time: 12:03 AM
Schedule task daily: every 1 day
Start date: some time in the past
Repeat task: every 5 minutes
Until: Duration 24 hours
Basically, i want the script to run every five minutes, for ever.
My problem is the task runs sometime after 23:47 every night (presumably after 23:55) and does not run after that.  What am I doing wrong? Alternatively, is there a different method you can suggest other than using Windows scheduled tasks?
Assistant: At the risk of not answering your question, can I suggest that if what you have to run is important or even critical then Windows task-Scheduler is not the way to run it. 
There are so many awful flows when using the task-scheduler. Lets just start with the obvious ones:
There is no logging. There is no way to investigate what happens when things go wrong. There's no way to distribute work across PCs. There's no fault-tolerance. It's Windows only and the interface is crappy. 
If any of the above is a problem for you you need something a bit more sophisticated. My suggestion is that you try Hudson, a.k.a. Sun's continuous integration server. 
In addition to all of the above it can do cron-style scheduling, with automatic expiry of logs. It can be set to jabber or email on failure and you can even make it auto diagnose what went wrong with your process if you can make it produce some XML output.
Please please, do not use Windows Scheduled tasks. There are many better things to use, and I speak from experience when I say that I never regretted dumping the built-in scheduler.
