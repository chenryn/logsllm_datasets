User: There are various ways to take screenshots of a running application in Windows. However, I hear that an application can be tailored such that it can notice when a screenshot is being taken of it, through some windows event handlers perhaps? Is there any way of taking a screenshot such that it is impossible for the application to notice? (Maybe even running the application inside a VM, and taking a screenshot from the host?) I'd prefer solutions in Python, but anything will do.
Assistant: There will certainly be no protection against a screenshot taken with a digital camera.
