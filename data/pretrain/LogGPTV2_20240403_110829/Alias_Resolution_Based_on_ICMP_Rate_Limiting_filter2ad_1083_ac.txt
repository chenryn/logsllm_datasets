44 ﬁles, each corresponding to a single router. All are Juniper routers. The ﬁles
concern 985 IPv4 and 803 IPv6 addresses/interfaces, from which we removed
436 IPv4 addresses and 435 IPv6 addresses that did not respond to any probes
sent by either Midar, Speedtrap, or Limited Ltd. The resulting dataset consists
of 6,577 IPv4 and 2,556 IPv6 alias pairs. For Switch, a single ﬁle was obtained
on 3 May, with measurements conducted 3–5 May 2019. The ﬁle identiﬁed 173
Cisco routers running either IOS or IOS-XR. From the 1,073 IPv4 and 706
IPv6 addresses listed in the ﬁle, we removed 121 IPv4 and 29 IPv6 unresponsive
addresses. The resulting dataset consists of 4,912 IPv4 and 2,641 IPv6 alias pairs.
Reducing False Positives. We computed the distribution of number of rounds
for refine() to ﬁnalize the alias set for each seed in our dataset: For 79% (98%)
of all seeds, refine() takes 2 (3) more rounds. Note that the minimum of two
rounds is required by design (Sect. 3.4). This basically implies that refine()
only changed the alias set for 20% of the seeds in a single round.
Results. Table 5 presents the precision and recall of Midar, Speedtrap, Limited
Ltd., and the union of both tools on IPv4 and IPv6 ground truth data from the
Internet2 and Switch networks. Note that it is possible for recall from the union
of both tools to be greater than the sum of recall values for individual tools, as
we observe in the Switch results. This arises from the transitive closure of alias
sets identiﬁed from the two tools that leads to the detection of additional alias
pairs. The main ﬁndings of Table 5 can be summarized as follows:
1. Limited Ltd. exhibits a high precision in identifying both IPv4 and IPv6 alias
pairs from both networks with zero false positives.
2. Limited Ltd. can eﬀectively discover IPv6 aliases that state-of-the-art Speed-
trap is unable to ﬁnd. In the Internet2 network that uses Juniper routers,
Limited Ltd. was able to identify 68.4% of the IPv6 alias pairs while Speed-
trap was unable to identify any. In the Switch network that deploys Cisco
routers, Limited Ltd. and Speedtrap show comparable performance by identi-
fying 38.5% and 38.4% of the IPv6 alias pairs, respectively. The results were
242
K. Vermeulen et al.
complementary, with the two tools together identifying 77.2% of the IPv6
alias pairs, a small boost beyond simple addition of the two results coming
from the transitive closure of the alias sets found by each tool.
3. Limited Ltd. can discover IPv4 aliases that state-of-the-art Midar is unable
to ﬁnd. In the Internet2 network, Limited Ltd. identiﬁes 80.0% while Midar
detects 67.3% of aliases. In the Switch networks, Limited Ltd. identiﬁed
49.9% while Midar detects only 9.0% of all aliases.
A couple of detailed observations follow. We conducted follow up analysis on
the behavior of Speedtrap and Midar to ensure proper assessment of these tools.
First, we examined Speedtrap’s logs to diagnose Speedtrap’s inability to detect
any IPv6 aliases for Internet2. We noticed that every fragmentation identiﬁer
time series that Speedtrap seeks to use as a signature, was either labeled as
random or unresponsive. This was not surprising, as prior work on Speedtrap [29]
also reported that this technique does not apply to the Juniper routers that
primarily comprise Internet2. Second, we explored Midar’s logs to investigate
the cause of its low recall for Switch. We learned that only one third of the
IPv4 addresses in this network have monotonically increasing IP IDs.
Limitations and Future Work. Because ICMP rate limiting could be trig-
gered at thousands of packets per second, Limited Ltd. requires the sending
of many more packets than other state-of-the-art alias resolution techniques.
The maximum observed probing rate during the experiments for this paper
was 34,000 pps from a single vantage point during a 5 s round. On Internet2
(Switch), Midar and Speedtrap sent 164.5k (106k) and 4k (12.7k) probe pack-
ets while Limited Ltd. sent about 4,8M (12.7M) packets. In future work, we plan
to explore ways to reduce the overhead of probing and make Limited Ltd. more
scalable.
5 Ethical Considerations
Limited Ltd. works by triggering limits in routers that are there for protective
reasons. This raises ethical concerns, which we discuss below. To evaluate the
impact of Limited Ltd., we have taken two steps: experiments in a lab environ-
ment (Sect. 5.1 and Appendix A), and feedback from operators (Sect. 5.2).
5.1 Lab Experiments
We have run experiments in a lab environment on conservatively chosen hard-
ware (over 10 years old) to show that Limited Ltd. has a controlled impact. Our
ﬁndings are that: (1) routers being probed with Echo Requests by the tool remain
reachable to others via ping with a high probability; and (2) Router CPUs show
a manageable overhead at the highest probing rate, leading us to believe that our
measurements are unlikely to impact the control and data planes. (3) Both Lim-
ited Ltd. and existing measurement techniques impact troubleshooting eﬀorts
Alias Resolution Based on ICMP Rate Limiting
243
(e.g., ping, traceroute). Limited Ltd. does not stand out in terms of impact
compared with other accepted techniques. Appendix A details the experiments
which support these conclusions.
5.2 Real-World Operator Feedback
In addition to lab experiments, we conducted joint experiments with SURFnet
and Switch to evaluate the potential impact of Limited Ltd. The experiment
consisted in running Limited Ltd. on their routers while they were monitoring
the CPU usage. Each run lasted about 1 min. For SURFnet, we ran Limited
Ltd. on two Juniper routers: an MX240 and an MX204. The operator observed a
4% and 2% CPU overhead. The operator also told us that the CPU overhead was
observed on the MPC (line modules) CPU and not the central routing engine
CPU. For Switch, we ran Limited Ltd. on three Cisco routers: an NCS 55A1, an
ASR 9001, and an ASR-920-24SZ-M. On the two ﬁrst routers, the operator told
us that there was no observable change in CPU utilization. On the third router,
which has a lower CPU capacity than the two others, the operator observed a
CPU overhead up to 29%. These results conﬁrm our belief that Limited Ltd. is
unlikely to impact the control and data planes.
6 Conclusion
This paper presents Limited Ltd., a new, high-precision alias resolution technique
for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks that leverages the ICMP rate limiting feature
of individual routers. We have shown that ICMP rate limiting can generate loss
traces that can be used to reliably identify aliases from other interfaces. Limited
Ltd. enables IPv6 alias resolution on networks composed of Juniper routers that
the state-of-the-art Speedtrap technique is not able to identify. As a part of our
future work, we plan to enhance the eﬃciency of Limited Ltd. and explore the
use of ICMP rate limiting for ﬁngerprinting individual routers. Both the source
code for Limited Ltd. and our dataset are publicly available4.

A Ethical Considerations
A.1 Precautions Taken
We take two precautions, that we understand to be community best practice: We
sent all probing traﬃc from IP addresses that were clearly associated via WhoIs
with their host locations, either at our institution or others hosting PlanetLab
Europe nodes. We have also set up a web server on the probing machines with a
contact email, so that any network operators could opt out from our experiment.
We received no notice whatsoever from network operators expressing concern
about our measurements. Though this is a positive sign, it could be that there
are impacts that were not noticed, or that the concerns did not reach us. We
therefore pushed our examination further, as detailed in the following sections.
A.2
Impact on Other Measurements
Limited Ltd.’s find rate() aims to ﬁnd an ICMP Echo Request probing rate
that produces an Echo Reply trace with a loss rate in the [0.05, 0.10] range.
While it is searching for this rate, it can induce a loss rate above 0.10. If it does
so, it proceeds to a binary search to ﬁnd a lower probing rate for which traces
falls within the desired range. Figure 5 shows that loss rates can go as high as
0.60.
The impact on reachability for the IP addresses of that node is that there is a
worst case 0.60 probability that a single ping packet to such an address will not
receive a response if it arrives at the node during the ﬁve seconds of highest rate
probing time. Most pings occur in series of packets, so the worst case probabilities
are 0.36 for two ping packets being lost, 0.22 for three, 0.13 for four, 0.08 for ﬁve,
and 0.05 for six. These are worst case probabilities for the ﬁve seconds at highest
loss rate. Average reachability failure probabilities are 0.22 for one ping packet,
0.05 for two, 0.01 for three, and so on, while a node is being probed at its highest
rate. To judge whether such a level of interference with other measurements is
exceptional, we compare it to the impact of the state-of-the-art Midar tool.
Midar has a phase during which it elicits three series of 30 responses each,
Alias Resolution Based on ICMP Rate Limiting
245
Fig. 6. Example erroneous traceroute result
using diﬀerent methods for each series: TCP SYN packets, to elicit TCP RST or
TCP SYN-ACK responses; UDP packets to a high port number, to elicit ICMP
Destination Unreachable responses; and ICMP Echo Request packets, to elicit
ICMP Echo Reply responses [26]. The probing rate is very low compared to
Limited Ltd.: a mere 100 packets per second across multiple addresses. This is
not a concern for the TCP and ICMP probing. However, the UDP probing taps
into an ICMP rate limiting mechanism that tends to be much less robust than
the typical ICMP Echo Reply mechanism on some routers. ICMP Destination
Unreachable messages are often rate limited at 2 packets per second, which is
1/500th the typical rate at which ICMP Echo Reply messages are rate limited.
(For example, the default rate at which Cisco routers limit ICMP Destination
Unreachable messages is 1 every 500 ms.)
We found that, when an IP address is a traceroute destination, Midar can
completely block ICMP Destination Unreachable messages coming from that
destination. Figure 6 illustrates the impact. The ﬁgure shows two traceroute
results, the top one from before or after Midar being run, and the bottom
one during Midar probing. During the Midar run, we see that traceroute
receives no responses while it is probing hop 15, where the destination is in
fact to be found. The normal functioning of traceroute is to continue probing
at higher and higher hop counts. Only a few seconds later, when traceroute is
sending probes to hop 20, does it start to receive ICMP Destination Unreachable
messages from the destination. The result is an erroneous traceroute, indicating
that the destination is ﬁve hops further away than it actually is. We observed
this erroneous traceroute eﬀect on 2,196 IP addresses out of a dataset of 10,000
IPv4 addresses collected from across the Internet. For both Limited Ltd. and
Midar, transient interference with other measurements can be observed for the
few seconds during which an IP address is being probed. Our conclusion is not
that the diminution in ping reachability induced by Limited Ltd. is necessarily
anodyne. Care should be taken to circumscribe this eﬀect. But we observe that
it does not stand out in terms of its impact on other measurements.
CPU Usage. We now examine the CPU overhead generated by Limited Ltd.,
and its potential impact on the forwarding plane and other features involving
246
K. Vermeulen et al.
the CPU. We have run an experiment in a local network with our own Cisco
(model 3825, IOS 12.3) and Juniper (model J4350, JunOS 8.0R2.8) routers. The
experiment consists in measuring three metrics while find rate() routine of
Limited Ltd., which has the highest probing rate, is running. We measured: (1)
The CPU usage of the router, (2) the throughput of a TCP connection between
the two end hosts, and (3) the rate of BGP updates. ICMP rate limiting is
conﬁgured on both our Juniper and Cisco routers with an access list [10,21],
limiting the ICMP input bandwidth destined to the router to 1,000 packets per
second, which is the default conﬁguration on Juniper routers.
TCP throughput was unaﬀected, at an average of 537 Mbps and BGP updates
remained constant at 10 per second. CPU usage was at 5% for Cisco and 15% for
Juniper when Limited Ltd. was not probing. During the probing, the maximum
overhead was triggered for both at a maximum probing rate of 2,048 packets
per second, with a peak at 10% for Cisco and 40% for Juniper during 5 s. Our
conclusion is that there is an impact of high probing rates on CPU, but we do
not witness a disruptive impact on either the data plane (TCP throughput) or
the control plane (BGP update rate).
