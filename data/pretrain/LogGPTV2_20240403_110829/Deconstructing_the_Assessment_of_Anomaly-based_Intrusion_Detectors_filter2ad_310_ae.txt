### PAYL Payloads and Detector Performance
The presented results for PAYL's detector performance cannot be generalized beyond the single evaluation instance. The variability in training data (TR1.2), the amount of data used (TR3), and the choice of learning parameters, such as the clustering threshold (TR2.3), can significantly influence detector performance. The authors trained the model on two weeks of data (weeks 1 and 3). It remains unclear whether using a different two-week period (e.g., weeks 1 and 2) would yield the same results. Therefore, the results are specific to the single evaluation instance and may not hold if another sample from the same dataset were used. Although PAYL is designed to work in an incremental learning mode, this functionality was not evaluated, leaving the efficacy of the detector in that mode uncertain. In summary, the key uncertainty is whether PAYL can consistently achieve 100% detection accuracy with a low false-alarm rate across different instances of the same dataset.

### Kruegel et al. [26] - Anomaly Detector for Web-Based Attacks
Kruegel et al. [26] evaluated a multi-model based anomaly detector for detecting web-based attacks on individual web-server requests. The evaluation was conducted over three datasets: one from a production web server at Google, Inc., and two from web servers at different universities. They reported a 100% detection rate when tested against twelve attacks injected into the dataset from one of the university web servers. This paper provided a robust example of a reliable evaluation, useful for determining the applicability of the technology in our systems. We were able to account for all factors necessary to confirm the validity of the detection results, but two uncertainties remained regarding the consistency of detection.

#### Uncertainties in Detection Consistency
- **Training Data**: All evaluations were performed using the first 1000 queries to build profiles and compute detection thresholds. It is unclear how changes in the number of queries used for training (TR3) would affect the detection results.
- **Dataset Variability**: The detector was assessed using a test corpus created by injecting attacks into one of the university web server datasets, which showed less variability compared to the other two datasets. It is uncertain whether similar detection performance (100% detection) could be achieved if the same attacks were injected into a more variable dataset, such as the Google dataset (TR1.2).

### Summary of Results from Case Studies
The case studies discussed earlier highlighted how unexplained factors across the evaluation phases affect the validity and consistency of detection results. We summarize the efficacy of the evaluations by counting the multiple possible explanations for the hit and miss results due to these unexplained factors.

#### Analysis Framework
We apply the analysis developed in Section 4.3 and present results for the case studies in Table 3. Each row in Table 3 is filled as follows:
1. For each event, we gather the set of factors influencing validity and consistency from Table 1.
2. For each case study, we record if any of those factors were identified in our previous discussion. There are three possibilities:
   - If no factors were identified, it means there was enough information to explain away the factors (labeled YES).
   - If no factors were identified, another possibility is that assumptions were made to explain away the factors (labeled YES*).
   - If any factors were identified, it means there was insufficient or no information to confidently state that the event was unperturbed (labeled NOINFO).
3. We then use this information along with the framework in Figure 3 to count the possible explanations for hits and misses for the case study.

From a combined perspective of valid and consistent detection, we see that for Mahoney et al. [28] and Wang et al. [29], the uncertainty in the evaluation process induces four possible explanations for a "hit" and six explanations for a "miss." The best example of a reliable evaluation is by Kruegel et al. [26], with only two possible explanations for a hit and zero explanations for a miss. However, their reported hits, while valid, cannot be concluded to be both valid and consistent.

### Conclusions
Our objective was to examine the mechanics of an evaluation strategy to better understand how the integrity of the results can be compromised. We explored the factors that can induce errors in the accuracy of a detector's response, presented a unifying framework of how these error factors interact with different phases of a detector's evaluation, and used our framework to reason about the validity and consistency of the results in three well-cited works.

The framework helps answer the "why" questions often missing in current evaluation strategies, such as why a detector detected or missed an attack. Our contribution is a step toward the design of rigorous assessment strategies for anomaly detectors.
