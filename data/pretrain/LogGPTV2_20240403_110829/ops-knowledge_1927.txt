User: How to reduce database load and improve query speed on a high traffic website? Please provide at least two possible optimization options.
Assistant: 1. Data cache: Cache frequently queried data into memory to reduce the number of visits to the database, thereby reducing database load and improving query speed. You can use tools such as memcached or redis to implement data caching. 2. Database sharding: Divide the database into multiple parts according to certain rules, and each part stores part of the data, reducing the load pressure on a single database. The database can be sharded according to factors such as the region and time of the data, and can also be implemented in two ways: vertical sharding and horizontal sharding.
