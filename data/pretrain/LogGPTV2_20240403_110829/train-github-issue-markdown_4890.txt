##### Detailed description
Is there any developer discussion about not only including OpenVino's
inference engine, but making it the default back-end when it is included? I
went to enable this back end and ended up swimming in legal documents using
scary terms about patent rights and such. So, I'm trying to figure out where
the developer discussion about this took place to maybe help me understand the
legal implications of leaning on apparently proprietary and patent-encumbered
dependencies.
I wasn't sure whether to discuss this here or on the answer site, but just in
case, I've opened the same discussion there as well.
Please feel free to close this out if the answers site is the better site.
##### Steps to reproduce
  * Try to enable Intel inference engine.
  * Start a gofundme to go back to school for the next decade to become a lawyer in order to determine how much of your soul the engine requires, how many of your descendants it includes, or if you'll be filing for bankruptcy soon.
