### TypeID Distribution and Physical Measurements in Power Grids

**TypeID Definitions:**
- **I36**: Measured value, short floating point with a time tag.
- **I13**: Measured value, short floating point without a time tag.

These two typeIDs represent approximately 97% of the Application Service Data Units (ASDUs) exchanged in the power grid.

### Analysis of Physical Quantities and Events

In power systems, some physical quantities, such as frequency and voltage, need to be kept constant at specific values. Other quantities, like current and power, can vary based on consumer demand and generation response. We performed a normalized variance analysis to identify "interesting" events where variables showed unusual changes.

**Power Fluctuations:**
- **Figure 18 (Bottom Plot)**: Shows power fluctuations due to an "unmet load" event caused by a failure. This resulted in a higher frequency because the electric generation exceeded the load. The system operator then sent AGC commands to reduce generation and stabilize the system.
- **Figure 19**: Illustrates the sequence of AGC commands and their effects on generator output.

**Voltage Changes:**
- **Figure 18 (Top Plot)**: Most voltages are within nominal values, but one time series shows a jump from 0 kV to about 120 kV, indicating a generator being brought online. This spike is a signature of the generator being synchronized and connected to the grid.
- **Figure 20**: Details the steps involved in connecting a generator, including ramping up, status changes, and power delivery.

**State Machine for Generator Activation:**
- **Figure 21**: Represents the state machine for the generator activation process, which can be used to verify if future substation activations follow the expected pattern and to justify power variations.

### Summary and Future Work

By performing deep packet inspection (DPI) and extracting physical values from network packets, we can identify anomalies in the physical world and create signatures of normal behavior. These measurements could be useful in Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to correlate cyber-attacks with abnormal physical behavior in the power grid.
