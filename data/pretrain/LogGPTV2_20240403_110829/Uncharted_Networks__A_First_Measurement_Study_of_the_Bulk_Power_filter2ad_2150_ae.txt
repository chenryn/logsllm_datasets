Table 8 summarizes all observed typeIDs with their correspond-
ing physical measurements (e.g., current, power, voltage, frequency,
etc.), and a few typeIDs for which we were not able to identify their
semantic value.
In power systems there are some physical quantities that con-
trollers need to keep constant at a given value (e.g., frequency and
voltages) while other physical quantities are allowed to change
based on consumer demand and the associated response in gener-
ation (current and power). We performed a normalized variance
analysis of each of these time series in order to identify “interesting”
events (events where one variable was changing more than usual).
Our first finding was in the analysis of power, as we can see
power fluctuations in Fig. 18, bottom plot. This was a case of "unmet
load" caused by a failure, it means that there was a lost electric
load at some point, causing the frequency of the power grid to
increase because there was more electric generation than electric
load. The system operator then needs to ask generators to reduce
their production of electricity in order to stabilize the system via
AGC messages; once the electric load is reconnected to the power
grid, the generation is ramped up again. These sequence of AGC
commands and their effect can be seen in Fig. 19.
Figure 18: Voltage and active power fluctuations
Figure 19: The bottom time-series is the AGC control com-
mands, and the top two series show how generators react to
the control actions.
212
Figure 20: The top plot shows the voltages (at the input and
output of a step-up transformer) as the generator was be-
coming active (ramping up), the middle plot shows a change
of status in a circuit breaker that connects the generator to
the power grid, and the bottom plot shows the power fluctu-
ations in power once the generator is connected to the grid.
Figure 21: Signature of Power System Behavior
Another interesting finding was when we measured voltage val-
ues. Fig. 18 (top) shows that most voltages are within the nominal
values; however, we can see that one of the time series jumps from
0kV to about 120kV. This is the signature of when a generator is
put online. Connecting a generator to the power grid requires the
generator to be synchronized to the grid. The measured voltages
have a spike from 0 to its nominal value (a value around 130 kV) in-
dicating that the generator is ready to be connected to the network.
Then the operator takes some time to get the generator ready to
connect it to the network (i.e. equalizing its frequency and phase
to the network’s). When it is connected, it starts to deliver active
power to the power system, the reactive power can show a positive
or negative value since it depends on the voltage needs, so the gen-
erator can consume or produce reactive power. We can see these
steps in Fig. 20: during the generator ramping up duration, both
active and reactive power would remain unchanged until a Status
(middle time-series) changed from 0 to 2, meaning that it closes the
circuit breaker to connect the generator to the power grid. We can
create a state machine representing these relationships in Fig. 21,
and this machine can be used to identify whether or not future
activation of substations follow this expected pattern, or if power
variations are justified or not.
In summary, by performing DPI and extracting physical val-
ues from these network packets, we can identify anomalies in the
physical world, and also create signatures of expected normal be-
havior (e.g., Fig. 21). We expect that these types of measurements
might be useful in future Security Operation Centers (SOCs) for

7 CONCLUSIONS
While there is a growing interest in the research community in
SCADA networks, most of the related work relies on simulations
and testbeds [14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 26], and has not analyzed real-
world deployments. The closest work to ours is the work of Formby
et al. [10] who measured and characterized the TCP connection
dynamics of an electric distribution system. In contrast, our paper
looks at the bulk power system, which is a more fundamental part
of the operation of the grid. In addition, our paper also performs
deep-packet inspection of the SCADA protocol. As far as we are
aware, our paper is the first to take a look at a real-world SCADA
network in the bulk power grid, and in addition perform a deep-
packet inspection analysis of this network.
In addition, we discussed the challenges for not having all equip-
ment is under the same administrative domain. We also profiled
and identified the reasons of the complexity of some connections,
as well as the real-world measurements of physical values and their
behavior during operation.
As more critical infrastructure systems migrate from dedicated
serial communications to Internet-compatible networks, we need to
start investigating these new networks, their expected performance,
and identify unusual behaviors. In addition, the rising threat of cy-
berattacks like those who created blackouts in Ukraine [7] should
motivate more researchers to help develop defenses for these net-
works. In particular, the Industroyer malware [2], which helped
create a blackout in Ukraine, leveraged IEC 104 to send false control
commands to substations. In future work we plan to take a look
at how to create white lists that correlate cyber (e.g., Markov net-
works) and physical (time-series analysis) network measurements
to identify suspicious activities in these networks.
