User: You are looking for an availability monitoring solution for your company's mobile app service. Please list a few solutions that you think are feasible and explain their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: 1. Application built-in usability monitoring function: The corresponding mobile App development framework usually provides built-in usability monitoring function, which can automatically detect and diagnose errors for applications, provide real-time reports and data analysis, and facilitate developers to solve problems in a timely manner. However, this solution can only detect errors within the application, and is not suitable for monitoring external problems such as the network, and may cause runtime performance problems. 2. Third-party usability monitoring tools: There are some third-party tools on the market that provide availability monitoring for mobile applications, such as New Relic and AppDynamics, which can provide functions such as data collection, reporting, and analysis of application performance indicators. This solution is more comprehensive than the built-in functions of the application when monitoring factors such as external networks, and has high data reliability, but it requires additional costs, and the data needs to be uploaded to a third-party platform, and data security issues need to be considered. 3. Self-built availability monitoring platform: If the company has a large scale and technical strength, it can consider building its own availability monitoring platform, which can customize monitoring indicators and early warning rules according to the company's business needs, while ensuring data security. However, this solution requires high cost and time for development and maintenance, and requires continuous optimization of monitoring indicators and adjustment of monitoring and early warning thresholds. 4. Cloud availability monitoring service: Similar to third-party availability monitoring tools, there are also some cloud availability monitoring services to choose from. These cloud services have the advantages of automated deployment, visualized operation, and low cost, and data security issues also need to be considered. Compared with third-party usability monitoring tools, it is more flexible and has outstanding performance in expansion and personalized operations. To sum up, it is impossible to say which solution is the best, which mainly depends on the company's needs, financial budget, technical strength, security requirements and personalized operations. Further explanation: 1. The built-in availability monitoring function of the application is suitable for quick troubleshooting during the development iteration process, but it cannot provide comprehensive monitoring of factors such as external networks. 2. While third-party availability monitoring tools provide comprehensive performance index data and analysis, they require additional costs and involve data upload and security issues. 3. The self-built availability monitoring platform is suitable for large-scale companies that pursue data security and customized monitoring requirements, but the cost and maintenance work are relatively high. 4. The cloud availability monitoring service is more flexible and convenient than third-party tools, and different solutions can be selected according to specific situations. Recommended solution: According to the company's financial budget, technical strength, and security requirements, it is recommended to use third-party availability monitoring tools or cloud availability monitoring services, which can save costs and maintenance work while ensuring data reliability.
