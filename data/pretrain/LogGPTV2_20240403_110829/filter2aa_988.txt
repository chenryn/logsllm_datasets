Overview and Agenda
3
Verisign Confidential and Proprietary
• Attack’s and the data associated with them are ever 
increasing
• Security organizations are now collecting more data 
than analyst can triage
•
Multiple databases with separate UI’s to query
• Passive DNS data
• WHOIS Data
• Malware Repository
• Open Source Intelligence
• How do you sift through terabytes of domains, IP 
addresses, malware strings, assembly code and 
network PCAPs to find that one indicator driving the 
next attack?
The Problem
4
Verisign Confidential and Proprietary
• Leverage a data visualization product to actively query 
multiple data sources quickly and connect nodes.
• Serves as analysis suite
• Significantly expedites data processing
• Focus analyst effort on information that matters
• Many graph-based problems in security
• iDefense has chosen to use Paterva’s Maltego
software to act as a visualization.
• Use open source transforms to expedite 
• Develop custom transforms to access internal and external 
systems
• Automate repeatable processes through the use of machines
The Solution
5
Verisign Confidential and Proprietary
• iDefense identifies a malicious file using the following 
domain for C&C:
• itsec.eicp.net
• Dynamic DNS domain resolving to over 800 IP 
addresses
• Over 500 Second level domain associations
• Manually sifting through all this data would take an 
extreme amount of analyst effort

Verisign Confidential and Proprietary
• Not a 100% solution
• But significantly better than before
• Platform Limitations
• Smaller user base
• Collaborative research is an issue
• There is no undo button – this is a bitch
• Slow update process to client
• Lacks ability to pass-the-graph
• The representation of time in Passive DNS is a hurdle
Problems to Overcome

Live Demo
14
Verisign Confidential and Proprietary
• Not enough companies doing visualization of security 
data
• Platforms need to easily integrate into existing 
databases and solutions
• Analysts need to have a way to save the graph 
connections outside of a platform
• Data should be queried in a graph-based fashion to 
obtain connections without visuals
• Time and other factors need to be accounted for when 
plotting data
Need for More
15
Verisign Confidential and Proprietary
• Visualization is not perfect, but speeds up analyst 
workflow if done properly
• Visual platforms are able to take multiple databases 
filled with potentially overlapping data and show 
connections
• Analyst is still and will always be required to validate 
decisions and identify the most useful information
