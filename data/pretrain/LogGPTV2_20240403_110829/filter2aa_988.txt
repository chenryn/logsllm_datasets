## The Problem

### Challenges in Security Data Management

- **Increasing Volume of Attacks and Data:** The number of attacks and associated data is growing exponentially.
- **Data Overload for Analysts:** Security organizations are now collecting more data than analysts can effectively triage.
- **Multiple Databases with Separate Interfaces:**
  - Passive DNS Data
  - WHOIS Data
  - Malware Repository
  - Open Source Intelligence
- **Efficiency in Analysis:** How do you sift through terabytes of domains, IP addresses, malware strings, assembly code, and network PCAPs to find the one indicator driving the next attack?

## The Solution

### Leveraging Data Visualization

- **Data Visualization Product:** Utilize a data visualization tool to quickly query multiple data sources and connect nodes.
- **Analysis Suite:** Serves as an integrated analysis suite that significantly expedites data processing.
- **Focused Analysis:** Directs analyst efforts towards information that truly matters.
- **Graph-Based Problems:** Many security issues can be addressed using graph-based solutions.
- **iDefense's Choice:** iDefense has selected Patervaâ€™s Maltego software for data visualization.
- **Transforms:**
  - Use open-source transforms to expedite processes.
  - Develop custom transforms to access internal and external systems.
- **Automation:** Automate repeatable processes using machines.

## Targeted Attack Case Study

### Example Scenario

- **Malicious File Identification:**
  - **Domain for C&C:** `itsec.eicp.net`
  - **Dynamic DNS Domain:** Resolves to over 800 IP addresses.
  - **Second Level Domains:** Over 500 associations.
  - **Analyst Effort:** Manually sifting through this data would require an extensive amount of effort.

## Problems to Overcome

- **Not a 100% Solution:** While better than previous methods, it is not perfect.
- **Platform Limitations:**
  - Smaller user base.
  - Collaborative research is challenging.
  - Lack of an undo feature.
  - Slow update process for clients.
  - Inability to pass-the-graph.
  - Representation of time in Passive DNS is a hurdle.

## Need for More

- **Adoption of Visualization:** Not enough companies are utilizing visualization for security data.
- **Integration:** Platforms need to easily integrate into existing databases and solutions.
- **Saving Graph Connections:** Analysts need a way to save graph connections outside of the platform.
- **Graph-Based Queries:** Data should be queried in a graph-based fashion to obtain connections without visuals.
- **Time and Other Factors:** Time and other factors need to be accounted for when plotting data.

---

## Conclusions

- **Visualization Improves Workflow:** While not perfect, visualization significantly speeds up analyst workflows.
- **Connecting Multiple Databases:** Visual platforms can take multiple, potentially overlapping databases and show connections.
- **Analyst Validation:** Analysts are still essential for validating decisions and identifying the most useful information.
