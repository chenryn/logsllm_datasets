User: After i recently updated the gcloud components with gcloud components update to version 108.0.0, i noticed the gcloud preview app deploy app.yaml command has started taking too long every time (about 15 minutes) for my project. Before this it only used to take about a minute to complete.
I figured out that using gcloud preview app deploy --verbosity info app.yaml displays progress of deployment process and I noticed every file in source code is being uploaded every time i deploy including the files in lib directory which has a number of packages installed, about 2000 files in it so this is where the delay is coming from. Since I am new to appengine, i dont know if this is normal. 
The project exists inside a folder of git repo, and i noticed after every deploy, 2 files in default directory, source-context.json and source-contexts.json, are being created and have information about git repo inside. I feel that can somehow be relevant.
I went through a number of relevant questions here but couldnt figure out the issue. It would be great if this can be resolved if its an issue at all because its a big inconvenience having to wait 15 mins to deploy every time.
I only started using google appengine a month ago so please dont mind if the question is incorrect. Please let me know if additional info is needed to resolve this. Thanks
UPDATE: I am using gcloud sdk on ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Assistant: Yes, this is the expected behaviour, each deployment is standalone, no assumption is made about anything being "already deployed", all app's artifacts are uploaded  at every deployment.
Update: Kekito's comment suggests different tools may actually behave differently. My answer applies to the linux version of the Python SDK, regardless of deploying a new version or re-deploying the same version.
