## 1. Introduction
In this work, we propose a novel wireless collaborated hybrid data center architecture that addresses the conflict between network performance and cable complexity using flexible and dynamic wireless transmission.

Several switch-centric tree-based and server-centric recursively designed data center networks have been proposed, achieving high throughput with relatively low cost. However, as data center networks expand, these designs often become impractical. Firstly, they introduce a large number of new switches and cables, significantly increasing cable complexity. Secondly, traffic patterns in data centers are unpredictable, leading to temporary hot spots and flow congestion. Consequently, data center networks must be over-deployed to handle worst-case scenarios. Thirdly, even with known traffic patterns, wired data center networks lack the flexibility to adapt to all traffic patterns. Fourthly, the dense cabling behind racks hinders system cooling and poses challenges such as degeneration, space consumption, and diagnostic difficulties.

The emerging 60 GHz wireless technology offers dense, fast, and cost-effective connectivity. Some works have explored integrating wireless links into data center networks. For instance, Flyways [1] use 60 GHz wireless technology to alleviate hot spots in oversubscribed data center networks. Additionally, a completely wireless data center design using cylindrical racks has been proposed [2]. However, neither approach provides a practical architectural design for wireless collaborated hybrid data centers. Flyways focus on mitigating hot spots rather than overall architecture, and the completely wireless data center is impractical due to its specific requirements, such as cylindrical racks.

In our work, we explore RF-HYBRID, a novel hybrid data center architecture that leverages both wired and wireless links to improve system efficiency. RF-HYBRID reduces cable complexity while maintaining excellent network performance through flexible wireless links. However, several challenges arise in designing and deploying a hybrid network architecture. First, the design space for wireless deployment is extensive, requiring careful placement to create effective wireless detours and shortcuts. Second, the limited range and potential signal blockage of wireless links necessitate multi-hop indirect routing, which should be minimized to enhance overall efficiency. Third, interference between wireless signals must be managed, complicating the design.

The potential contributions of our work are:
1. Proposing an efficient hybrid data center architecture that optimizes the use of wireless links and reduces cable complexity.
2. Designing traffic-aware topology adaptation approaches for wireless links. Specifically, small world shortcuts can reduce packet delivery latency in the absence of congestion, while wireless detours can eliminate hot spots during congestion.
3. Developing a comprehensive and efficient routing and congestion control method for the hybrid data center, including a wireless interference model to validate the system design.

## 2. Prospective Design
### 2.1 Hybrid Data Center Architecture
For the regular wired network, we prefer a 2D torus topology over a tree-based topology for two reasons. First, the 2D torus eliminates the switching fabric and has a more regular structure. Second, when augmented with shortcuts, the torus can exhibit small-world properties, significantly reducing the network diameter. Our hybrid architecture design is applicable to various wired data center networks.

The wireless collaborated hybrid data center architecture forms a small-world graph under low traffic conditions. To construct appropriate shortcuts with wireless links, we propose a location-based shortcut distribution approach (Figure 1). When setting up random shortcuts between nodes, both their lattice distance in the torus and their physical distance between servers/racks are considered. Uniformly distributed shortcuts with the least physical distances are chosen to facilitate wireless links. A novel server/rack layout strategy is also being developed to decrease the physical distance between corresponding wireless-augmented servers. For example, Figure 1 shows a grid-based rack layout instead of a horizontal lane layout to better accommodate concurrent wireless transmissions in limited data center space.

### 2.2 Traffic-Aware Topology Adapting
During traffic congestion, wireless links can form effective detours to relieve hot spots [1]. Constructing wireless detours involves three steps: estimating traffic and predicting demands, locating hot spots, and instantiating the wireless detour. Finally, routing changes to distribute data flows through the detour, improving system throughput under congestion.

### 2.3 Routing and Congestion Control
Optimal shortest path routing in large-scale small-world networks is resource-intensive. Therefore, we assume greedy geographical routing, accepting relatively longer path lengths. A comprehensive routing method that integrates wireless detour routing with small-world network routing is needed. Multi-hop indirect routing should be avoided in both scenarios. Congestion control is primarily achieved through traffic-aware topology adaptation combined with wireless detour routing.

An interference model is required to evaluate and validate the dense deployment of wireless links. D. Halperin et al. [1] provide detailed methods and parameters for modeling 60 GHz propagation, 802.11ad MAC, directional antennas, and data center layouts. Simulations are conducted using the ns-3 simulator [3].
