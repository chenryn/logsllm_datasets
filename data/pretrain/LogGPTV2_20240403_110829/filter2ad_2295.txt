ABSTRACT
This paper introduces a novel wireless collaborated hybrid
data center architecture called RF-HYBRID that could opti-
mize the eﬀect of wireless transmission while reduce the com-
plexity of wired network. RF-HYBRID improves through-
put and packet delivery latency through ﬂexible wireless de-
tours and shortcuts, with a comprehensive routing and con-
gestion control method.

INTRODUCTION
In this work we propose a novel wireless collaborated hy-
brid data center architecture that addresses the conﬂict be-
tween network performance and cable complexity with the
help of ﬂexible and dynamic wireless transmission.
Several switch-centric tree-based data center networks and
server-centric recursively designed data center networks have
been proposed which could achieve high throughput with rel-
atively low expense. Nevertheless, with the sheer expanding
of data center networks, these new designs often fall short
of practicality. Firstly, these elaborately designed topolo-
gies often bring along a large amount of new switches and
cables, and especially lead to tremendously increased cable
complexity. Secondly, the traﬃc patterns of applications
in the data center are diﬃcult to predict, and burst ﬂows
often exist that result in hot spots and ﬂow congestion tem-
porarily. Therefore, in view of the worst case, data center

networks usually have to be over-deployed. Thirdly, even if
the traﬃc patterns are known in advance, the wired data
center network is ﬁxed and not ﬂexible enough to suit every
traﬃc pattern. Fourthly, a large amount of cable bundles
behind racks is disadvantageous for the cooling of the sys-
tem, and cables also face problems of degeneration, space
consumption and diagnostic diﬃculties.
The 60 GHz wireless technology that is now emerging has
the potential to provide dense and extremely fast connectiv-
ity at low cost. Several works have considered introducing
wireless links into data center networks. Flyways [1] uti-
lize the 60 GHz wireless technology to relieve hot-spots in
oversubscribed data center networks. Besides, a novel data
center design for completely wireless data centers built with
cylindric racks is presented [2]. However, neither of them
has proposed a practical architectural design for wireless col-
laborated hybrid data centers. While ﬂyways only consider
wireless aided hot-spot mitigation rather than the overall
architecture, the completely wireless data center falls short
of practicality due to the speciﬁc facilities such as cylindric
racks.
In our work, we will explore a novel hybrid data center
architecture called RF-HYBRID, trying to take advantages
of both wired and wireless links to improve the overall sys-
tem eﬃciency. RF-HYBRID could largely reduce the cable
complexity while preserve the favorable properties of excel-
lent network performance in virtue of ﬂexible wireless links.
Nevertheless, several challenges exist for the design and de-
ployment of hybrid network architecture. First, the design
space of wireless deployment is large. Hence wireless place-
ment should be carefully determined to construct wireless
detours and shortcuts to improve the throughput and la-
tency of the network. Second, since the eﬀective range of
wireless links is limited and the signals could be blocked by
obstacles, multi-hop indirect routing is needed under some
circumstances, while multi-hop routing should be cut down
to the utmost extent to improve the overall eﬃciency. Third,
interference avoidance between wireless signals should also
be taken into consideration which complicates the general
design.
The potential contributions of our work are: (1) we plan
to propose a novel eﬃcient hybrid data center architecture
which optimizes the utilization of wireless links and reduces
the cable complexity. (2) We plan to design traﬃc-aware
topology adapting approaches for wireless links. Speciﬁcally,
small world shortcuts could be constructed to reduce the
packet delivery latency when there is no congestion. On the
contrary, when there is congestion, wireless detours could be

prehensive eﬃcient routing and congestion control method
for the hybrid data center. In addition, the wireless inter-
ference model would be built to validate the system design.
2. PROSPECTIVE DESIGN
In this section, the RF-HYBRID architecture of a regular
wired network augmented with wireless detours and short-
cuts is described, followed by the design of a comprehensive
routing and congestion control method.
2.1 Hybrid Data Center Architecture
For the regular wired network, we would rather choose
2D torus over tree-based topology for two reasons. First,
2D torus eliminates the switching fabric and has more reg-
ular structure. Besides, when augmented with shortcuts,
the torus would obtain small world properties which could
largely reduce the network diameter. However, our design of
hybrid architecture extends to all kinds of wired data center
networks.
The wireless collaborated hybrid data center architecture
is arranged as a small world graph when there is little traﬃc
congestion. In order to construct appropriate shortcuts with
wireless links, we propose a location-based shortcut distri-
bution approach (see Figure 1). More concretely, when we
are setting up random shortcuts between nodes, both their
lattice distance in the torus and their physical distance be-
tween servers/racks are considered. In other words, as long
as the shortcuts are uniformly distributed in the lattice, we
can choose the ones with the least physical distances for the
convenience of wireless links. Moreover, a novel server/rack
layout strategy is also being developed to achieve decreased
physical distance between corresponding wireless augmented
servers. For example, in Figure 1 we adopt a novel grid-
based rack layout rather than the horizontal lane rack layout
in order to improve accommodation of concurrent wireless
transmissions in limited space of data centers.
2.2 Trafﬁc-aware Topology Adapting
When there is traﬃc congestion, wireless links could form
eﬀective detours to relieve hot-spots [1]. There are three
steps to construct wireless detours. First of all, the traﬃc is
estimated and the demands are predicted, and subsequently
the hot-spots are located. Afterwards, the wireless detour is
instantiated. At last, the routing changes towards the detour
to distribute data ﬂows. The adapting topology improves
the system throughput under congestion circumstances.
2.3 Routing and Congestion Control
Optimal shortest path routing in large scale small world
networks is consuming. Therefore we have to assume greedy
geographical routing and hence accept relatively long path
length.
A comprehensive routing method which integrates wire-
less detour routing with the small world network routing is
needed. In addition, multi-hop indirect routing should be
avoided under both circumstances. Congestion control is
mainly done by traﬃc-aware topology adapting combined
with wireless detour routing.
In addition, interference model is required to evaluate and
validate the dense deployment of wireless links. D. Halperin
[1] gives detailed methods and parameters to model 60 GHz
propagation, 802.11ad MAC, directional antennas and data
center layouts. The simulations are done using the ns-3 sim-
ulator [3].
