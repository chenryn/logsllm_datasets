```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ProviderName 'ADFS' | Where-Object { $_.ID -eq '412' -or $_.ID -eq '411' -or $_.ID -eq '342' -or $_.ID -eq '516' -and $_.TimeCreated -gt ((Get-Date).AddHours(-"8")) }
```
### Collate ADFS logs in Microsoft Entra ID
Microsoft Entra Sign-In reports include ADFS sign-in activity when you use Microsoft Entra Connect Health. Filter sign-in logs by Token Issuer Type "Federated".
Here's an example PowerShell command to retrieve sign-in logs for a specific IP address:
```powershell
Get-AzureADIRSignInDetail -TenantId b446a536-cb76-4360-a8bb-6593cf4d9c7f -IpAddress 131.107.128.76
```
Also, search the Azure portal for time frame, IP address and successful and interrupted sign-in as shown in these images.
:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Selectingtimeframe.jpg" alt-text="timeframe":::
*Searching for sign-ins within a specific time frame*
:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Selectingipaddress.jpg" alt-text="ipaddress":::
*Searching for sign-ins on a specific IP address*
:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Selectingstatus.jpg" alt-text="status":::
*Searching for sign-ins based on the status*
You can then download this data as a *.csv* file for analysis. For more information, see [Sign-in activity reports in the Microsoft Entra admin center](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins).
### Prioritize findings
It's important to be able to react to the most critical threat. This threat can indicate that the attacker has successfully obtained access to an account and therefore can access/exfiltrate data; the attacker has the password but may not be able to access the account. For example, they have the password but aren't passing the MFA challenge. Also, the attacker couldn't be guessing passwords correctly but continuing to try. During analysis, prioritize these findings:
- Successful sign-ins by known attacker IP address
- Interrupted sign-in by known attacker IP address
- Unsuccessful sign-ins by known attacker IP address
- Other unknown IP address successful sign-ins
### Check legacy authentication
Most attacks use legacy authentication. There are many ways to determine the protocol of the attack.
1. In Microsoft Entra ID, navigate to **Sign-Ins** and filter on **Client App.**
2. Select all the legacy authentication protocols that are listed.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Legacyauthenticationchecks.jpg" alt-text="authenticationcheck":::
    *List of legacy protocols*
3. Or if you have an Azure workspace, you can use the prebuilt legacy authentication workbook located in the Microsoft Entra admin center under **Monitoring and Workbooks**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/authenticationbook.png" alt-text="workbook":::
    *Legacy authentication workbook*
### Block IP address Microsoft Entra ID for managed scenario (PHS including staging)
1. Navigate to **New named locations**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/Namedlocation.jpg" alt-text="Example of a new named location":::
2. Create a CA policy to target all applications and block for this named location only.
### Has the user used this operating system, IP, ISP, device, or browser before?
If they haven't and this activity is unusual, flag the user and investigate all of their activities.
### Is the IP marked as "risky"?
Ensure you record successful passwords but failed MFA responses, as this activity indicates that the attacker is getting the password but not passing MFA.
Set aside any account that appears to be a normal sign-in, for example, passed MFA, location and IP not out of the ordinary.
### MFA reporting
It's important to also check MFA logs to determine if an attacker has successfully guessed a password but are failing the MFA prompt. The Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication logs show authentication details for events when a user is prompted for multifactor authentication. Check and make sure there are no large suspicious MFA logs in Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [how to use the sign-ins report to review Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication events](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-reporting).
### Additional checks
In Defender for Cloud Apps, investigate activities and file access of the compromised account. For more information, see:
- [Investigate compromise with Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/investigate)
- [Investigate anomalies with Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/investigate-anomaly-alerts)
Check whether the user has access to more resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), domain account permissions, storage, among others.
If there is a data breach, you should inform more agencies, such as the police.
## Immediate remedial actions
1. Change the password of any account that you suspect has been breached or the account password discovered. Additionally, block the user. Make sure you follow the guidelines for [revoking emergency access](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/users-revoke-access).
2. Mark any compromised account as "*compromised*" in Azure Entra ID Identity Protection.
3. Block the IP address of the attacker. Be cautious while performing this action as attackers can use legitimate VPNs and could create more risk as they change IP addresses as well. If you are using Cloud Authentication, then block the IP address in Defender for Cloud Apps or Microsoft Entra ID. If federated, you need to block the IP address at the firewall level in front of the ADFS service.
4. [Block legacy authentication](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication) if it's being used (this action, however, could impact business).
5. [Enable MFA](/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa) if it isn't already done.
6. [Enable Identity Protection](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies) for the user risk and sign-in risk
7. Check the compromised data (emails, SharePoint, OneDrive, apps). See how to use the [activity filter in Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/activity-filters).
8. Maintain password hygiene. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra password protection](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/password-guidance/).

## Recovery
### Password protection
Implement password protection on Microsoft Entra ID and on-premises by enabling the custom-banned password lists. This configuration prevents users from setting weak passwords or passwords associated with your organization:

### Tagging IP address
Tag the IP addresses in Defender for Cloud Apps to receive alerts related to future use:
:::image type="content" source="./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/IPaddresstag.jpg" alt-text="Example of tagging an IP address":::
*Tagging IP addresses*
In Defender for Cloud Apps, "tag" IP address for the IP scope and set up an alert for this IP range for future reference and accelerated response.
