subscribers using each application protocol or category over
the course of each trace set. However, given the likelihood
of customer churn over the course of several months, we did
not extend this assumption across trace sets.
4. RESULTS
4.1 Bytes Transferred
Figures 1 and Figure 2 show the quantity of bytes down-
loaded by residential DSL subscribers relative to the value
observed in January 2011, i.e. prior to the CAA coming
into eﬀect. Figure 1 shows the analysis on the category level
whereas Figure 2 shows the results for a selection of indi-
vidual application protocols. A category or protocol must
have contributed at least one gigabyte per day in order to
be included in either graph.
Overall, traﬃc across all categories decreased 7.5% in Jan-
uary 2012 compared with the volume observed in the previ-
ous year. Unencrypted web traﬃc was mostly static across
all three trace sets but HTTPS traﬃc tripled between Jan-
uary 2011 and January 2012.

Figure 4: Active residential DSL subscribers using
an application from each category, relative to the
subscriber count in January 2011.
There were signiﬁcant decreases in both the P2P and P2P
structure categories. Downloaded traﬃc that was recognis-
able as P2P fell by 69% between January 2011 and Septem-
ber 2011 and recovered only slightly in January 2012. P2P
structure traﬃc, i.e. P2P network maintenance traﬃc, was
less aﬀected but still decreased by 32% in September 2011.
The primary cause for the decrease in both categories ap-
peared to be a decline in BitTorrent usage. Also, Gnutella
UDP traﬃc disappeared almost entirely from the ISP net-
work, accounting for only 5% of the volume that it had in
January 2011.
The Newsgroups and Encrypted categories also experi-
enced sharp declines in traﬃc volumes in September 2011.
Binary newsgroups are commonly used for sharing ﬁles (in-
cluding copyrighted material) while many P2P ﬁle sharing
applications use SSL to encrypt traﬃc. The decrease in
encrypted traﬃc is likely because encryption does not pro-
tect against detection by copyright holders, as they detect
infringements by ﬁnding New Zealand IP addresses partic-
ipating in P2P networks that are sharing the copyrighted
content. Some major newsgroup providers have been shut
down in recent times, e.g. News-Service.com was closed in
November 2011 [1], which may have caused the decline in
NNTP traﬃc in the January 2012 dataset.
Unknown traﬃc also decreased in September 2011, which
shows that the ﬁle sharing traﬃc did not move to new unde-
tectable protocols. Rather, the decline in Unknown traﬃc
leads us to believe that the converse may have been true:
much of the Unknown traﬃc in January 2011 may have been
encrypted P2P traﬃc that we were unable to detect using
libprotoident.
By contrast, there were large increases in downloaded traf-
ﬁc matching the Files, Remote and Tunneling categories.
Figure 2 shows that this was due to the growing use of pro-
tocols such as FTP, SSH, ESP (Encapsulating Security Pro-
tocol) and Teredo. Another protocol worth mentioning that
is not present in Figure 2 is OpenVPN, which was seldom
observed in January 2011 but was much more prominent in
the later trace sets.
Our belief is that much of the growth in these categories
can be attributed to users changing their ﬁle sharing ap-
proach. Rather than participating in P2P exchanges from
home where they can be detected by copyright holders and
issued an infringement notice under the CAA, the user down-
loads ﬁles using a seedbox located in a foreign country. The
ﬁles are then copied directly back to their personal computer
using either a secure tunnel, such as a VPN, or downloaded
from a secure HTTP or FTP service running on the seedbox.
This could also explain the large growth in HTTPS traﬃc.
While Files, Remote and Tunneling traﬃc has grown sig-
niﬁcantly, the total volume of traﬃc matching those cate-
gories was still relatively small compared with P2P traﬃc,
as shown in Table 3. BitTorrent alone was still responsible
for more downloaded traﬃc than any tunneling or remote
access protocols. Furthermore, daily BitTorrent traﬃc de-
creased by 39 GB between January and September 2011
whereas growth in the daily traﬃc matching the Files, Re-
mote and Tunneling categories was less than 5 GB for the
same time period. Daily HTTPS traﬃc grew by 13 GB in
the same time period, but it is unlikely that the entire in-
crease can be attributed to seedboxes, e.g. online shopping,
Internet banking and secure login to social media sites such
as Facebook are also likely contributing factors.
Following the enactment of HADOPI in France, many
users switched to using illegal streaming to access copy-
righted content [10]. We also observed an increase in Stream-
ing traﬃc in the September 2011 data set but the growth
was not enough to suggest an uptake similar to that observed
in France. This may be partly due to New Zealand’s geo-
graphic isolation – the streaming sites hosted are not within
New Zealand and the latency to foreign sites would likely
result in a poor user experience. Rather, we suspect this in-
crease is the result of increased uptake of legal radio, music
and television streaming services which have developed an
increased presence in New Zealand recently.
The CAA was also intended to target uploaders of copy-
righted material. Figure 3 shows the traﬃc transmitted
by residential DSL users, again broken down by category.
Many of the trends observed in downloaded traﬃc were also
present in uploaded traﬃc, such as the decrease in P2P ﬁle
sharing and an increase in the Tunneling and Streaming
categories. Outgoing Mail traﬃc had also increased signif-
icantly, although it is unlikely that this is related to the
CAA.
