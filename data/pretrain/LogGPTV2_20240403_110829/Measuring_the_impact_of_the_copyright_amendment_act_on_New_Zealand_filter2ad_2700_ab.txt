### 4. Results

#### 4.1 Bytes Transferred

**Figures 1 and 2:**
- **Figure 1** shows the quantity of bytes downloaded by residential DSL subscribers relative to the value observed in January 2011, broken down by category.
- **Figure 2** provides a detailed breakdown for a selection of individual application protocols.

A category or protocol must have contributed at least one gigabyte per day to be included in either graph.

**Overall Trends:**
- Total traffic across all categories decreased by 7.5% in January 2012 compared to the previous year.
- Unencrypted web traffic remained relatively static across all three trace sets.
- HTTPS traffic tripled between January 2011 and January 2012.

**Detailed Analysis:**

**P2P and P2P Structure Categories:**
- Recognizable P2P traffic fell by 69% between January 2011 and September 2011, with only a slight recovery in January 2012.
- P2P structure traffic (network maintenance) decreased by 32% in September 2011.
- The primary cause for these decreases was a decline in BitTorrent usage.
- Gnutella UDP traffic nearly disappeared, accounting for only 5% of its January 2011 volume.

**Newsgroups and Encrypted Categories:**
- Both categories experienced sharp declines in traffic volumes in September 2011.
- Binary newsgroups, commonly used for sharing files (including copyrighted material), saw a significant drop.
- Many P2P file-sharing applications use SSL to encrypt traffic, but this did not protect against detection by copyright holders.
- The shutdown of major newsgroup providers, such as News-Service.com in November 2011, likely contributed to the decline in NNTP traffic.

**Unknown Traffic:**
- Unknown traffic also decreased in September 2011, suggesting that file-sharing traffic did not move to new undetectable protocols.
- Instead, much of the unknown traffic in January 2011 may have been encrypted P2P traffic that was undetectable using libprotoident.

**Growth in Specific Categories:**
- There were large increases in downloaded traffic matching the Files, Remote, and Tunneling categories.
- This growth was due to the increased use of protocols such as FTP, SSH, ESP (Encapsulating Security Protocol), and Teredo.
- OpenVPN, which was seldom observed in January 2011, became more prominent in later trace sets.

**User Behavior Changes:**
- The growth in these categories is attributed to users changing their file-sharing approach.
- Users are now downloading files using seedboxes located in foreign countries and then transferring them back to their personal computers via secure tunnels (e.g., VPNs) or secure HTTP/FTP services.
- This behavior also explains the large growth in HTTPS traffic.

**Comparison of Traffic Volumes:**
- While Files, Remote, and Tunneling traffic grew significantly, their total volume was still small compared to P2P traffic.
- BitTorrent alone was responsible for more downloaded traffic than any tunneling or remote access protocols.
- Daily BitTorrent traffic decreased by 39 GB between January and September 2011, while the growth in daily traffic for the Files, Remote, and Tunneling categories was less than 5 GB.
- Daily HTTPS traffic grew by 13 GB, but factors such as online shopping, Internet banking, and secure logins to social media sites also contributed to this increase.

**Streaming Traffic:**
- An increase in Streaming traffic was observed in the September 2011 dataset, but it was not as significant as the increase seen in France following the enactment of HADOPI.
- New Zealand's geographic isolation and latency issues with foreign streaming sites likely contributed to this difference.
- The increase in Streaming traffic is more likely due to the uptake of legal radio, music, and television streaming services in New Zealand.

**Impact on Uploaders:**
- The CAA also targeted uploaders of copyrighted material.
- **Figure 3** shows the traffic transmitted by residential DSL users, broken down by category.
- Similar trends were observed in uploaded traffic, including a decrease in P2P file sharing and an increase in Tunneling and Streaming categories.
- Outgoing Mail traffic also increased, though it is unlikely to be related to the CAA.
