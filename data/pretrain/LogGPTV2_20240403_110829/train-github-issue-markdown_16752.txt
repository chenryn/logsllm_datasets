#### Description
`sklearn.utils.multiclass` `unique_labels()` does not yet allow `"multiclass-
multioutput"` input type for `y` .  
See this comment in the code:
scikit-learn/sklearn/utils/multiclass.py
Line 53 in 3a48f0a
|  At the moment, we also don't allow "multiclass-multioutput" input type.  
---|---  
This type is used by multilabel classifiers such as
`sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`.  
scikit-learn/sklearn/tree/tree.py
Line 763 in 4bba216
|  y : array-like, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_outputs]

So I propose to add support for this. At first glance, it doesn't appear to be
difficult. Is there any reason not to to this?
