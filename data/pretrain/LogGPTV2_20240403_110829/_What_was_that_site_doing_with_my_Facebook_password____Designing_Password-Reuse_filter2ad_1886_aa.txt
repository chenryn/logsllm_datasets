ABSTRACT
Password reuse is widespread, so a breach of one provider’s pass-
word database threatens accounts on other providers. When compa-
nies find stolen credentials on the black market and notice potential
password reuse, they may require a password reset and send af-
fected users a notification. Through two user studies, we provide
insight into such notifications. In Study 1, 180 respondents saw
one of six representative notifications used by companies in situa-
tions potentially involving password reuse. Respondents answered
questions about their reactions and understanding of the situation.
Notifications differed in the concern they elicited and intended
actions they inspired. Concerningly, less than a third of respon-
dents reported intentions to change any passwords. In Study 2, 588
respondents saw one of 15 variations on a model notification syn-
thesizing results from Study 1. While the variations’ impact differed
in small ways, respondents’ intended actions across all notifications
would leave them vulnerable to future password-reuse attacks. We
discuss best practices for password-reuse notifications and how
notifications alone appear insufficient in solving password reuse.

1 INTRODUCTION
People reuse passwords [10, 16, 20, 32, 44, 46, 65]. An average user
may have hundreds of different online accounts [16, 44, 65], and
passwords are unlikely to be completely replaced anytime soon [4].
As password managers [13, 37] and single sign-on systems [3, 55]
have low adoption, password reuse is a common coping strategy.
Password reuse has major ramifications for the security of online
accounts. A breach of one account provider’s password database
puts at risk accounts on other services where login credentials are
the same as, or even just similar to [63], the breached accounts.
Attackers that target large leaks of passwords stored using com-
putationally expensive hash functions (e. g., scrypt) exploit this
password reuse in offline guessing [22]. Attackers try to match iden-
tifiers like usernames and email addresses to previously cracked
credentials. They then transform the already known passwords to
increase their likelihood of correctly guessing passwords [9, 26, 62].
Unfortunately, password breaches are common. The website
haveibeenpwned.com counts billions of compromised account cre-
dentials due to data breaches, including from high-profile services
like Yahoo!, LinkedIn, MySpace, and Dropbox [31, 45]. Thomas et al.
estimated that 7–25 % of passwords traded on black-market forums
match high-value targets like Google accounts [57].
Account providers send a variety of notifications about situa-
tions potentially caused by password reuse. We refer to all such
notifications as password-reuse notifications, regardless of whether
password reuse is explicitly mentioned. To protect their users, some
providers proactively monitor black-market sources for passwords
stolen from other sites, searching for matches in their own password
database [39]. Once aware of such situations, these providers send
notifications to affected users, encouraging them to change their
password. Password-reuse notifications also include notifications
about suspicious login attempts, which may have been triggered
by a password-reuse attack, or notifications requiring a password
reset after a data breach. In a recent example, Twitter asked users
to change not only their Twitter passwords, but also passwords on
services where they had reused their Twitter password [1].
Surprisingly little is known about how users interpret or re-
spond to password-reuse notifications, and how the design of such
notifications impacts users’ understanding and risk perception.
Current password-reuse notifications vary widely, and despite the
frequency with which such notifications are sent, no best practices
have been outlined. This paucity of knowledge contrasts with the
large and rich literature investigating the design of warnings and
notifications about other security-critical tasks, including detecting
phishing [11, 53], TLS-protected browsing [2, 15], malware [6, 7],
and two-factor authentication (2FA) [48]. Many studies have aimed
to help users make better passwords [12, 40, 59] or measured the
prevalence of password reuse [10, 32, 46, 57]. This paper is the first
to explore how to inform users about situations caused by password
reuse and help them recover from the resultant consequences.
Password-reuse notifications face the herculean task of help-
ing users understand and respond to a convoluted situation. Users
have posted on Twitter about their confusion about receiving such
notifications. For example, one tweet about a notification asked,
“What was another site doing with my Facebook password in the
first place?” This may be because understanding the risks of pass-
word reuse requires knowledge of how attackers leverage password
breaches to compromise accounts on other services. Password-reuse
notifications must address this underlying complexity to convince
users to replace reused passwords across all sites with a new, unique
password for each account. We explain the complexity of these is-
sues from the perspective of a fictitious company, AcmeCo, which
we adopt for the remainder of this paper.
We conducted two complementary user studies about password-
reuse notifications. First, we sought to understand how users un-
derstand and perceive existing notifications. We collected 24 noti-
fications sent by real companies in situations that may have been
caused by password reuse. We chose six notifications whose charac-
teristics were representative of the full 24. In Study 1, we conducted
a scenario-based online survey in which 180 Mechanical Turk work-
ers saw one of these six notifications (Sec. 3). We asked respondents
why they might have received such a notification, the feelings the
notification elicits, and what actions they might take in response.
Respondents reported they would be alarmed and confused, and
that they would intend to take action in response to receiving these
notifications (Sec. 4). Some notifications were more effective than
others at encouraging a response. Ultimately, though, participants’
responses misattributed the potential root cause of receiving these
(real, previously deployed) notifications. Only 20.6 % mentioned
the breach of another company’s password database as a potential
cause, and only 18.8 % mentioned password reuse as a factor.
Based on respondents’ perceptions and responses (Sec. 5), we
identified five design goals for password-reuse notifications that
integrated characteristics of notifications that were effective in
Study 1 and improved upon characteristics that were less effective.
We then conducted a follow-up study to analyze a model noti-
fication we believed achieved all five design goals (Sec. 6). This
notification explicitly describes password reuse and the breach of
another provider as the cause of the notification. Additionally, it
forces a password reset, encourages other beneficial security ac-
tions, and is delivered through multiple mediums. Study 2 was again
a scenario-based survey in which 588 Mechanical Turk workers
saw one of 15 variants of this model notification.
While Study 2 respondents perceived our model notification as
official and urgent, they nonetheless misattributed the root cause
of the notification (Sec. 7). Many respondents did not perceive pass-
word reuse as a potential cause of the situation. Additionally, al-
though nearly all respondents stated intentions to change one or
more passwords, most reported plans to create these “new” pass-
words by reusing other passwords of theirs, leaving them vulnerable
to similar attacks in the future. From our collected results, we es-
tablish best practices for maximizing the effectiveness of password-
reuse notifications. However, because password-reuse notifications
may not be sufficient on their own, we conclude with a discussion of
additional steps for holistically addressing password reuse (Sec. 9).
2 BACKGROUND
We summarize prior work on password reuse and warning design.
2.1 Passwords and Password Reuse
Passwords are the dominant method of user authentication for on-
line accounts due to their low cost, immediacy, convenience, and de-
ployability [4, 27]. Although online account providers employ meth-
ods beyond passwords to improve security, such as 2FA [8, 24] and
risk-based authentication [19, 23, 41], solutions such as password
managers face steep adoption barriers [13]. Accounts therefore
remain vulnerable to a number of password-related attacks [61].
Password reuse amplifies the severity of all password attacks.
Once login credentials are compromised, all accounts with those
same credentials become vulnerable. Various studies over the years
have found that users reuse a majority of their passwords across
sites [10]. Users have dozens of accounts, but only a few passwords
that they cycle through [14, 16, 44, 54, 65]. Users reuse passwords
to minimize the burden of memorization [17, 20], and they do so
especially often for accounts they consider lower value [20, 54].
Even if users do not reuse passwords verbatim, they often modify
existing passwords when creating new ones [34, 44, 52].
We consider password breaches to be cases where a hacker ille-
gally obtains login credentials from a vulnerable system [30]. Once
an account is breached, any other accounts sharing the same creden-
tials become vulnerable [26]. Breaches are frequent, with over 4.5
billion credentials reported stolen in 2016 [30]. Leveraging stolen
credentials enables attackers to perform online guessing with some
success. Thomas et al. accumulated over 1.79 billion non-unique
usernames and passwords from credential leaks, finding that 7–25 %
of those credentials would enable attackers to log into a compro-
mised account holder’s Google account [57]. Credential-stuffing,
which automates logging into as many sites as possible with the
stolen login credentials, generates more than 90 % of login traffic
on many of the world’s largest websites and mobile apps [51]. Once
accounts have been compromised, attackers may use them for spam,
financial data, or distributing malware [43, 56].
2.2 Security Warnings and Notifications
A large body of prior work has researched security warnings and
notifications broadly. Some examples include encouraging users to
adopt 2FA [48] and detecting phishing [11, 53]. In their study of 25
million Google Chrome and Firefox users, Akhawe et al. found that
user experience has a significant impact on behavior and that users
often do look at warnings [2], contrary to other findings that users
are susceptible to habituation and often ignore web warnings [5, 6].
Despite extensive prior work measuring password reuse, very
few studies have examined password-reuse notifications. Jenkins et
al. evaluated the efficacy of just-in-time fear appeals in warnings —
“persuasive messages intended to better help someone be aware of
a threat and to persuade them to engage in protective action” — at
preventing users from reusing passwords, finding that such appeals
resulted in a significant decrease in password reuse [33]. This sug-
gests that notifications could encourage better password creation
and management strategies. There is a need, however, to isolate
what is effective or ineffective about these notifications. While Zou
et al. studied reactions to notifications of the Equifax data breach,
their work did not examine password reuse [66]. Huh et al. studied
the notification LinkedIn sent users after their password database
was breached, finding that less than half of participants changed
their LinkedIn password upon receiving this notification [29]. While
they asked respondents to self-report their actual reactions to re-
ceiving a single notification in the wild, we comparatively evaluate
many different notifications, isolating the factors that contribute to
particular reactions and understanding. Furthermore, while Huh
et al. studied a notification that LinkedIn sent their users encour-
aging them to change their LinkedIn passwords due to a breach
of LinkedIn, we focus on cases where cross-site password reuse
substantially complicates the situation. To our knowledge, prior
work has neither focused on notifications about cross-site password
reuse nor compared such notifications.
3 STUDY 1
Study 1 explored current password-reuse notifications. It investi-
gated user perceptions of, and reactions to, such notifications. Both
Study 1 and Study 2 were approved by our IRB.
As both Study 1 and Study 2 rely on respondents’ self-reports of
their feelings and actions they would intend to take, percentages
reported below should not be taken as ground truth. Rather, we use
our survey findings to inform the design of improved password-
reuse notifications. While observing notification response in the
wild may produce more accurate absolute reports of behavioral
response, such observational studies fail to allow us to understand
why people may react in certain ways and improve those reactions.
Thus, similar to prior work on SSL warnings [15], we use Study 1 to
identify potential areas of improvement for current password-reuse
notifications, developing a model notice that we evaluate in Study 2.
3.1 Recruitment and Survey Structure
We recruited participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, requiring
that workers be 18 years or older, live in the US, and have a 95 %+
approval rate. We advertised our study as a survey about “online
account notifications.” To avoid recruitment biases, we did not
mention security or privacy. Study 1 was a scenario-based survey
expected to take 15 minutes. Respondents were compensated $2.50.
Respondents were first introduced to the survey scenario: “In
the following survey, you will be asked to imagine that your name
is Jo Doe. You have an online account with a major company called
AcmeCo and can access your account through both a website and
a mobile application. Imagine that this account is important to you
and that it is like other accounts you may have, such as for email,

cations. The name of the condition identifies the provider
that currently uses that text.
