## Abstract
Password reuse is a widespread practice, and a breach in one provider's password database can compromise accounts on other services. When companies detect stolen credentials on the black market, they may notify affected users and require a password reset. Through two user studies, we provide insights into the effectiveness of such notifications. In Study 1, 180 respondents evaluated six representative notifications, revealing that less than a third intended to change their passwords. In Study 2, 588 respondents evaluated 15 variations of a model notification. Despite minor differences, respondents' intended actions would still leave them vulnerable to future attacks. We discuss best practices for designing password-reuse notifications and highlight the limitations of relying solely on notifications.

## 1 Introduction
Password reuse is a common practice among users, who often have hundreds of online accounts [10, 16, 20, 32, 44, 46, 65]. Despite the availability of password managers [13, 37] and single sign-on systems [3, 55], these solutions have low adoption rates, making password reuse a prevalent coping strategy. This practice has significant security implications, as a breach at one service can compromise accounts on other services where the same or similar credentials are used [63].

Attackers exploit password breaches by matching identifiers like usernames and email addresses to previously cracked credentials, then transforming known passwords to increase their chances of guessing correctly [9, 26, 62]. Websites like haveibeenpwned.com report billions of compromised credentials from high-profile breaches, including Yahoo!, LinkedIn, MySpace, and Dropbox [31, 45]. Thomas et al. estimated that 7–25% of passwords traded on black-market forums match high-value targets like Google accounts [57].

To protect users, some providers monitor black-market sources for stolen passwords and notify affected users, encouraging them to change their passwords. These notifications can also include alerts about suspicious login attempts or required password resets after a data breach. For example, Twitter recently asked users to change their passwords on other services where they had reused their Twitter password [1].

Despite the frequency of such notifications, little is known about how users interpret and respond to them. Current password-reuse notifications vary widely, and no best practices have been established. This contrasts with the extensive literature on the design of warnings and notifications for other security-critical tasks, such as phishing detection [11, 53], TLS-protected browsing [2, 15], malware [6, 7], and two-factor authentication (2FA) [48]. Many studies have focused on helping users create better passwords [12, 40, 59] or measuring the prevalence of password reuse [10, 32, 46, 57]. This paper is the first to explore how to inform users about situations caused by password reuse and help them recover from the consequences.

Password-reuse notifications face the challenge of helping users understand and respond to complex situations. Users often express confusion about receiving such notifications, as understanding the risks of password reuse requires knowledge of how attackers leverage breaches. Notifications must address this complexity to convince users to replace reused passwords with unique ones for each account. We use a fictitious company, AcmeCo, to explain these issues.

We conducted two complementary user studies to understand and improve password-reuse notifications. In Study 1, we collected 24 real-world notifications and selected six representative ones. We surveyed 180 Mechanical Turk workers, asking about their perceptions and intended actions. Respondents reported alarm and confusion, with only 20.6% attributing the notification to a breach of another company's database and 18.8% mentioning password reuse.

Based on these findings, we identified five design goals for effective password-reuse notifications and conducted a follow-up study (Study 2) with 588 participants evaluating 15 variants of a model notification. While respondents perceived the model notification as official and urgent, many did not attribute the root cause to password reuse. Although most intended to change their passwords, they planned to reuse other existing passwords, leaving them vulnerable to future attacks. We establish best practices for effective password-reuse notifications and discuss additional steps to address password reuse holistically.

## 2 Background
### 2.1 Passwords and Password Reuse
Passwords remain the dominant method of user authentication due to their low cost, immediacy, convenience, and deployability [4, 27]. Despite the availability of 2FA [8, 24] and risk-based authentication [19, 23, 41], password managers face steep adoption barriers [13]. Accounts remain vulnerable to various password-related attacks [61].

Password reuse amplifies the severity of these attacks. Once credentials are compromised, all accounts with the same credentials become vulnerable. Studies show that users reuse a majority of their passwords across sites [10], often modifying existing passwords when creating new ones [34, 44, 52]. Password breaches, where hackers illegally obtain login credentials, are frequent, with over 4.5 billion credentials reported stolen in 2016 [30]. Attackers use stolen credentials for online guessing and credential-stuffing, which generates over 90% of login traffic on many major websites and mobile apps [51]. Compromised accounts can be used for spam, financial fraud, or distributing malware [43, 56].

### 2.2 Security Warnings and Notifications
Extensive research has been conducted on security warnings and notifications, including 2FA adoption [48] and phishing detection [11, 53]. Akhawe et al. found that user experience significantly impacts behavior and that users do look at warnings [2], contrary to other findings that users often ignore web warnings [5, 6].

Few studies have specifically examined password-reuse notifications. Jenkins et al. found that just-in-time fear appeals in warnings can reduce password reuse [33]. Zou et al. studied reactions to Equifax data breach notifications but did not focus on password reuse [66]. Huh et al. found that less than half of participants changed their LinkedIn password after receiving a notification about a breach [29]. Our study evaluates multiple notifications, isolating factors that contribute to specific reactions and understanding, focusing on cross-site password reuse.

## 3 Study 1
### 3.1 Recruitment and Survey Structure
We recruited participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, requiring them to be 18 years or older, live in the US, and have a 95%+ approval rate. The study was advertised as a survey about "online account notifications" to avoid recruitment biases. Study 1 was a scenario-based survey expected to take 15 minutes, and respondents were compensated $2.50.

Respondents were introduced to a scenario involving an important online account with a fictitious company, AcmeCo. They were then shown one of six representative notifications and asked about their perceptions and intended actions. Table 1 summarizes the prominent characteristics of the six notifications.
