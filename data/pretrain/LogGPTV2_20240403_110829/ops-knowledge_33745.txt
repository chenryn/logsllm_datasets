User: I've made a game and I'd like to save the highscore.  So I need a place to do that. I chose to put it in the C:\All Programs directory. My problem is that that directory name isn't the same on every computer. For example on mine it's C:/Program Files (x86).
So my question:
Is there a way, to discover that path on any computer?
PROBLEM SOLVED:
os.getenv('PROGRAMFILES')
Assistant: I second @iCodez's answer to use os.getenvto get the path string from a system environment variable, but you might want to use the paths defined for APPDATA or LOCALAPPDATA instead. 
Windows permissions settings on the Program Files directory may prevent a standard user account from writing data to the directory. 
I believe the APPDATA and LOCALAPPDATA paths were designed for just such a use. On my system, APPDATA = C:\Users\myname\AppData\Roaming and LOCALAPPDATA = C:\Users\myname\AppData\Local. My user account has full read/write permission for both directories.
