Hi there! I am writing a suite of Playwright tests. So far it has mostly been
a joy to use.
However, I have run into some issues when parallelizing tests. I am pretty
sure that this functionality does not exist, but if it does, happy to learn
more about it.
The vast majority of my tests are independent and can be run in parallel
without any issues. Test objects are created at the start of the test and
cleaned up at the end. No problem. However, I have a few tests that
necessarily affect global state in the application. These can still clean
themselves up at the end so the state at the end of the test is the same as
the start. However, they can't be run in parallel with any other test because
their effects while running will mess with other tests.
So far I have solved this by only using one worker and running no tests in
parallel. This is not ideal, as it slows tests down a bit. **Is there (or can
there be) some way to run all tests with the specified number of workers but
run x tests (demarcated somehow in the test) only by themselves?**
I looked into https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe-serial
and thought I had found a way to do this, but this appears to only run tests
in a given `describe` block in serial and not be what I'm actually looking
for.
My next attempt is probably going to be to try to use some sort of semaphore
to get certain tests only to run on their own, but this will be kinda hacky
and it would be nice if the framework natively supported this feature.
Thank you!
