• Man-in-the-middle attack. This adversary tries to
actively participate in the pairing of two devices. His
goal is that one or both of the devices believe the
pairing protocol has completed successfully and the
resulting secret is only known to the two devices. We
make the assumption that such an adversary can relay,
alter and inject messages on the wireless channel as
well as record the electromagnetic signals transmitted
on the body channel. In addition, the adversary can
send electromagnetic signals at the the devices and
the person involved in the pairing, but similarly to the
remote pairing scenario, we assume that the adversary
is not in physical contact with any of the two devices.
Fig. 3. An adversary interferes with the wireless channel and records the
electromagnetic leakage from the human body channel.
We call this communication channel the human body channel.
The devices can also communicate with each other on a
wireless channel (see Figure 2). The wireless channel does
not have to provide any particular security guarantees for the
device pairing to work.
The human body channel is formed when a person is in
physical contact with both devices. If a person touches both
devices at the same time, one with each hand, the human body
acts as a transmission medium for intra-body communication
and both devices can send and receive messages on this
channel. The human body channel also allows the devices to
extract physical properties of received messages to validate
if they have indeed been sent over the body channel, i.e.,
“through” the person who is currently touching both devices.
B. Attacker Model
We specify three different adversaries: An adversary who
eavesdrops on the device pairing process, and adversary who
tries to perform remote pairing with a body channel enabled
device, and an adversary who launches a man-in-the-middle
attack during the pairing of two devices.
•
Remote pairing. This adversary tries to perform re-
mote pairing with a body channel enabled device. The
adversary does not have physical access to the target
device and therefore can not authorize the device to
pair by simply touching it. Due to the inability to
touch or hold the target device, the adversary can not
establish a body channel for the pairing process, but
he can attempt to initiate the the device pairing by
sending radio waves from a distance. He might do so
while the target device is on its own or while a person
is in physical contact with the device. It is important
to consider such a scenario since a person could be
touching the target device accidentally or be part of
an ongoing pairing execution.

three adversaries, we assume that
For all
they can only
establish an actual body channel if they are able to touch the
devices or the person involved in the pairing. The devices can
extract physical properties of the messages received on the
body channel and detect with high accuracy if a message is an
induced radio wave from an outside source. We thus consider
the human body channel as read-only for any signal source
other than the devices which are being paired and held by the
same person. We show that this is a reasonable assumption in
Section VIII. For the read-only property of the body channel
to hold, we state a minimum distance of 50 cm between the
adversary and the person involved in the pairing.
Like all other pairing protocols, our proposed pairing
mechanism can not prevent denial of service attacks. Hence,
we do not address attacks that have the sole goal of disrupting
the communication between the devices.
V. DEVICE PAIRING PROTOCOL
Two devices, henceforth referred to as Alice and Bob,
jointly agree on a secret using a wireless channel and the
human body channel. Alice and Bob follow the device pairing
protocol outlined in Figure 4. If the protocol terminates, it
guarantees that the secret is only known to Alice and Bob,
provided they have not revealed it
to any other party, of
course. The resulting mutual secret can, for instance, be used
in subsequent communication between the devices.
The protocol relies on the fact that Alice and Bob can
independently verify if the messages they receive on the body
channel have traveled through a human body. If they both
conclude that the physical properties of the received messages
match with the characteristics of the body channel, they must
be communicating with each other through the same person.
In that case, Alice and Bob must be held simultaneously
by the same person and the pairing protocol can terminate
successfully.
A. Protocol Description
The device pairing protocol consists of two steps: key
agreement and key conﬁrmation. Alice, who initiates the
protocol, chooses a private key a and picks a random nonce

The high-level goals of the adversary are to either eaves-
drop on the trafﬁc between two legitimate devices, place
himself as a man-in-the-middle, or perform remote pairing
with a target device.
In this section we show that neither a passive nor active
adversary can achieve these goals. We assume that the adver-
sary has full knowledge of the protocol including the public
parameters g and p.
A. Passive Eavesdropping
To show that our device pairing protocol is secure against
purely passive eavesdropping, we observe that the only in-
formation available to the adversary at the end of the key
agreement part of the protocol are the identities of the two
devices A and B, the freshly picked nonces Na and NB,
as well as the public Difﬁe-Hellman parameters ga and gb.
The identities are public and do not constitute information
leakage. The two nonces are freshly picked independently
from the private key, so they can not reveal any information.
If the computational Difﬁe-Hellman assumption holds for the
underlying group, then the adversary can not get the key K
from this information.
Furthermore, we observe that the only additional informa-
tion the adversary can obtain from the key conﬁrmation part
of the protocol are the two different MACs RN and LN . The
MACs are computed using the key K (or a derived MAC-
key), however assuming the MAC scheme is secure against
existential forgery, RN and LN do not reveal information about
the key.
B. Remote Pairing
In order for a remote adversary (i.e., an adversary that is
not physically being held by the same human as the device)
to perform device pairing, the adversary has to execute the
protocol with an honest device. Without loss of generality we
assume that the adversary takes the role of Alice, i.e., executes
the protocol with Bob.
The adversary must proceed according to the protocol
otherwise Bob will abort. After the key agreement part of the
protocol, the adversary does indeed share a key K(cid:48) = (gb)a(cid:48)
with Bob. However, in the key conﬁrmation part, after receiv-
ing RN = MACK(cid:48)(A(cid:107)B(cid:107)NA) from the body channel, the
adversary must send LN = MACK(cid:48)(RN(cid:107)NB) back on the
body channel. By the read-only property of the body channel
this can only be done with negligible probability (as explained
in Section VIII), thus a remote attacker can not successfully
complete the protocol with Bob (or Alice).
C. Active Eavesdropping and Man-in-the-middle Attacks
To demonstrate that our device pairing protocol is secure
against an active man-in-the-middle attack, we observe the
following. In order for the adversary to place himself in
the middle between Alice and Bob, he must either run the
protocol with each of them or interfere in an ongoing pairing
session between Alice and Bob. Furthermore, the adversary
must replace or modify at least one of the key agreement
messages, as this would otherwise be passive eavesdropping.

key agreement and the body channel (dotted arrows) for the key conﬁrmation.
NA. She then sends her identity A, (ga mod p) and the freshly
picked nonce NA to Bob on the wireless channel. Bob then
picks a private key b and a nonce NB and sends his identity B
together with (gb mod p) and the nonce back to Alice. Alice
and Bob can now independently construct a mutual secret
K and complete the key agreement phase. However, at this
point, Alice and Bob can not yet be certain if K is indeed a
mutual secret only known by them, since the wireless channel
is unauthenticated.
The key conﬁrmation phase follows immediately after the
key agreement. Bob computes a message authentication code
(MAC) RN using the newly created key K (or a derivative
thereof). The MAC is constructed over the concatenation of
the identities and nonces, and is sent to Alice over the “body
channel”. Alice veriﬁes the MAC RN , and veriﬁes that the
message came through the body channel (as described in
Section VIII). If both checks succeed, Alice knows that K
is a freshly generated secret shared with Bob. By sending RN
to Alice, Bob demonstrates that he can transmit messages over
the body channel and must be connected to Alice through the
same human body. He also conﬁrms that he knows K and
proves that Alice must have been communicating with him in
the preceding key exchange.
Finally Alice computes a MAC of RN using K, and sends
the result to Bob through the body channel. Bob veriﬁes the
MAC and the body channel like Alice did before. This proves
to Bob that Alice is in possession of K and can transmit on
the body channel.
Termination of the protocol guarantees that the mutual
secret K is known to Alice and Bob, and only to them provided
none of them revealed it to any other party. Moreover, Alice
and Bob can be sure that they were both held by the same
person when they ran the pairing protocol. If any of the
veriﬁcation steps fail, the protocol will terminate with an error.

As we showed above for the remote pairing attack, the
adversary can not successfully complete the protocol alone
with either Alice or Bob. The protocol does not terminate
in either case, since the body channel is read only for the
adversary and thus the key conﬁrmation fails.
Any modiﬁcation of the public DH contributions ga or gb
will, except with negligible probability, cause Alice and Bob
to disagree on the key. For example, if the adversary replaces
gb with gb(cid:48)
, we have
KA = (gb(cid:48)
)a (cid:54)= (ga)b = KB,
which will result in the veriﬁcation of RN to fail in the
key conﬁrmation part. Interference with any of the other
parameters sent in the protocol, A, B, NA or NB, will also
cause the veriﬁcation of RN to fail, assuming the underlying
MAC scheme is second pre-image resistant. By the read-only
property of the body channel, the adversary can not modify or
replace RN . Nor can he replace LN after Alice has aborted
the protocol, as a result Bob will also abort.
The only remaining option for the adversary is to initiate
two sessions simultaneously with both Alice and Bob, and then
rely on them to complete the key conﬁrmation phase. For this
to succeed the adversary must create two sessions where all
the nonces, identities and public parameters are the same, since
these are inputs to the MAC-function in the key conﬁrmation
part of the protocol. If all parameters are identical in the two
sessions, and Alice and Bob are both being held by the same
human, the protocol would succeed, but the adversary would
just have done passive eavesdropping (and learned nothing as
shown above).
D. The Human Body Channel
The security of the protocol relies on the assumption that
the human body channel is read only for the adversary. This
assumption models the fact that the receiving device can tell
the difference between messages sent by an external transmitter
and a device which is physically connected to the person
performing the pairing. The receiving device can thus ignore
any message that originates from an external source, which is
equivalent to saying that the channel is read only.
In the following sections we will document experiments
that verify this particular channel property and we state the
assumptions that need to be made in order for the property to
hold.

into an electric signal which is ampliﬁed and emitted through the touch-
electrode of the transmitter. The touch-electrode of the receiver is connected
to a software deﬁned radio which captures the incoming signal.

IMPLEMENTATION
Our design of the intra-body communication channel is
inspired by [33]. The authors of [33] are among the ﬁrst
to report reliable intra-body transmission based on capaci-
tive coupling. Their designed receiver front-end achieves a
transmission distance that spans the entire body. Our goal is
to establish hand-to-hand transmission which typically reach
around 180 cm for adults. We therefore adopted the impedance
matching network proposed in [33] and followed the design
choices found in Table I.
A. Measurement Setup
In order to simulate the pairing protocol between two
devices, we designed a proof of concept for a body channel
transmitter and receiver. For the purpose of our prototype set-
up, we did not implement two transceivers, but a separate
transmitter and receiver. A more ﬁnished apparatus could com-
bine the circuitry into two body channel transceivers that are
capable of sending and receiving messages, i.e., bidirectional
transmission.
The front-end of our receiver and transmitter implemen-
tation follow the exact same construction, which consists of
two electrodes, the ground electrode and the touch-electrode.
The person who pairs two devices only touches the touch-
electrodes. The ground electrodes are ﬂoating. We describe
the design of the electrodes in more detail in the following
section.
We used lab measurement devices to implement the actual
transmitter and receiver (see Figure 5). An arbitrary waveform
generator acts as the transmitter and a software deﬁned radio is
the receiver. The waveform generator and the software deﬁned
radio are both controlled by a workstation computer that is
used to specify the messages sent over the body channel and
processes the signal received by the software deﬁned radio.
The receiver electrodes are directly connected to the software
deﬁned radio to record the incoming signal. The transmitter

electrodes are connected to the waveform generator through an
ampliﬁer to boost the generated signal to the required 5 mW
sending power.
For safety reasons and to minimize cross-talk, we made
sure that the connections between the measurement devices are
optically isolated. We also placed transmitter and receiver in
such a way that they are separated by 120 cm and at least 200
cm away from any other electric conductor. Transmitter and
