User: I want to perform a comparison of multiple implementations of basically the same algorithm, written in Java, C++ and Python, the latter executed using Pypy, Jython and CPython on a Mac OS X 10.6.4 Macbook Pro with normal (non-SSD) HDD.
It's a "decode a stream of data from a file" type of algorithm, where the relevant measurement is total execution time, and I want to prevent bias through e.g. OS an HDD caches, other programs running simultaneously, too large/small sample file etc. What do I need to pay attention to to create a fair comparison?
Assistant: To get totally unbiased is impossible, you can do various stuff like running minimum processes etc but IMO best way is to run scripts in random order over a long period of time over different days and get average which will be as near to unbias as possible.
Because ultimately code will run in such environment in random order and you are interested in average behavior not some numbers.
