User: My problem is that i want to do something like this in linux console
telnet 192.168.255.28 > process.py
i.e i would  like to do some transformation with console telnet output using python script. I'm see Popen in python for this case, but i can't understand how can i get input from telnet if it do not stop all time..
Pleas any ideas.
Assistant: As xitrium mentioned, it would be better if you used telnetlib. You can dispense with the whole mess of shell redirection etc.
If you do something like telnet foo | process.py, you can read your programs stdin (sys.stdin) to get the output of the telnet program. When you're happy, you can exit and terminate the pipeline. subprocess.Popen would be used if you're trying to open the telnet program as a subprocess of the interpreter. I'm not sure you wanted that. 
In any case, telnetlib is the right way to go it seems. If you simply want an output text processor, consider perl. It's strengths lean in that direction.
