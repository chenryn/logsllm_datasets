in using HMA. These results suggest that HMA is usable and
desirable.
11 Conclusion
In this work, we have shown that apps can collect a signiﬁcant
amount of static and runtime information about other apps,
to ﬁngerprint them. Our analysis has shown that many third
parties are interested in learning about the apps installed on
people’s phones. Moreover, we have shown that there are no
existing mechanisms for hiding the presence of an app from
other apps. We have proposed HMA, the ﬁrst solution that ad-
dresses this problem. HMA does not require any modiﬁcations
to the Android OS and preserves the key functionalities of
apps. The results of our evaluation and user study suggest that
HMA is usable and of interest to users.

26P is deﬁned based on the estimation about the number of sensitive apps
that users of the HMA App Store can have, because Android does not permit
duplicate package names for apps. Average users have around 80 apps on
their phones, therefore P is at most 80.

30A signature-protected permission is a permission that the system grants
only if the requesting app is signed with the same certiﬁcate as the app that
declared the permission.
31We omit the app-update operation, because app-update and app-
