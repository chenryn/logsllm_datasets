User: Please provide a complete DevOps process, including code management, build and deployment, automated testing, monitoring and troubleshooting.
Assistant: complete DevOps process should include the following links: 1. Code management First, you need to choose an appropriate code management tool, such as Git, SVN, etc. Developers use code management tools to perform operations such as code submission, merging, and branch management. 2. Build and deploy After the developer submits the code, use an automated build tool, such as Jenkins, to build and package it. After the build is complete, use automated deployment tools, such as Docker, Ansible, etc., to automatically deploy the application to the test environment, pre-release environment, and production environment. 3. After the automated test developers submit the code, they will use automated testing tools, such as Selenium, JUnit, etc., to conduct automated testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. After the test is completed, the test result is fed back to the developer, and the illegally executed code is returned to the developer for repair. 4. Monitoring Real-time monitoring of the running status of the application by collecting application logs, indicators, and abnormal data. Visual monitoring tools such as Grafana can be used. 5. Troubleshooting If a failure occurs during the running of the application, it needs to be eliminated by means of log analysis and debugging techniques. In general, the DevOps process needs to closely integrate development, testing, deployment, operation and maintenance, etc., improve efficiency and quality through automated tools and processes, and achieve continuous delivery and continuous improvement.
