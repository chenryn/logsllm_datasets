User:  For some common network attack methods (such as DDoS attack, SQL injection, XSS attack, etc.), please list the security precautions.
Assistant: 1. DDoS attack defense measures: - Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to filter malicious requests - Use CDN technology to distribute server deployment to disperse attack traffic - Limit the request speed of a single IP address - Use reverse proxy for traffic filtering and caching - Installation DDoS defense equipment, such as firewalls, load balancers and traffic filters 2. SQL injection attack defense measures: - Effective filtering and escaping of user input data - Use parameter queries on the server side to avoid the process of SQL statement splicing - Use precompiled statements to dynamically replace variables through placeholders, avoiding direct splicing and passing parameters - Restrict database user permissions so that they can only query and update specific tables - Regularly upgrade database software and use the latest version 3. XSS attack Defensive measures: - Effective filtering and escaping of user input data - Set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to prevent untrusted script execution - Use HTTP Only Cookie to limit the accessible range of Cookie to HTTP requests, while Not broken in JavaScript - Avoid user input of HTML, HTML tags can be converted using tools like Markdown - Regularly upgrade the security of your web application In addition, strengthen the security protection of passwords and user sessions, and use encrypted transmission mechanism to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information. In addition, developers should also pay attention to whether the security libraries and frameworks used in the code are vulnerable, and update them at any time.
