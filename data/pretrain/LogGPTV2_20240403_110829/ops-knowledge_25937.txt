User: Use the Ansible automation tool to implement one-click deployment and configuration of multiple servers, improving deployment efficiency and consistency.
Assistant: Ansible is a Python-based automation tool that automates deployment and configuration management on multiple servers. It uses the SSH protocol to connect and execute tasks, and you can customize the operations that need to be performed by defining task lists and variables. The following are the steps to use Ansible for one-click deployment and configuration of multiple servers: 1. Install Ansible: Install Ansible on a management server, you can use the package manager that comes with the operating system or the installation package provided by the official website to install . 2. Configure SSH: Make sure that the SSH connection is realized between the management server and the target server. You can use public key and private key pair for authentication, or user name and password for authentication. 3. Create an Ansible inventory file: In the Ansible inventory file, you can define information such as the list of hosts to be managed, the host's IP address, port number, login user, and password. The default location of the inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts. 4. Write an Ansible playbook file: In the playbook file, you can define a list of tasks that need to be performed on the target server, such as installing software and configuring system parameters. 5. Run Ansible playbook: Execute Ansible playbook on the management server through the ansible-playbook command, Ansible will automatically execute the defined task list, and connect to the target server through SSH for operation. Through the above steps, automatic deployment and configuration management of multiple servers can be realized, which improves efficiency and consistency. At the same time, Ansible also supports custom modules and plug-ins, which can extend its functionality and flexibility.
