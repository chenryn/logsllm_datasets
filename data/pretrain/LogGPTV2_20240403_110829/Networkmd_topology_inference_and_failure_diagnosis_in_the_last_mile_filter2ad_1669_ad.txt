# NetworkMD: Topology Inference and Failure Diagnosis in Last-Mile Distribution Networks

## 1. Introduction
NetworkMD (Network Management and Diagnosis) is an automated framework for inferring topologies and diagnosing failures in last-mile distribution networks, such as cable networks. This paper presents the methodology, evaluation, and applications of NetworkMD.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Data Preparation
In our dataset, some modems were never observed to be faulty or offline. These modems were excluded from the analysis. Among the 53 failure instances, 20 were identical to previous observations, providing no additional information and thus were also excluded. The resulting failure instance matrix \( X \) has dimensions 33 × 1471.

### 2.2 Algorithm Application
Using \( X \) as input, we applied both Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and k-means algorithms to identify Failure Groups (FGs). For the k-means algorithm augmented with geographic information, we set the parameter \( \lambda \) to 0.05, which yielded the best results for this dataset.

### 2.3 Results
The results are summarized in Table 1. NMF and k-means with geographic information showed similar accuracy, with NMF having a slightly lower false negative rate. Without geographic information, k-means could not converge, making it unsuitable for high-dimensional data. The k-means algorithm with geographic information requires careful tuning of \( \lambda \), which can be challenging in practice. Therefore, NMF is more suitable for practical NetworkMD systems.

| Algorithm             | False Positive Rate | False Negative Rate |
|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| NMF                   | 0.09                | 0.106               |
| k-means with geo      | 0.133               | 0.249               |
| k-means without geo   | N/A                 | N/A                 |

### 2.4 Error Analysis
The false positive and false negative rates were higher than those observed in simulations. Potential reasons include:
- **Insufficient Failure Instances:** Many interfaces rarely failed during the monitoring period.
- **Failure Correlation:** Several interfaces often failed together, leading to higher false positive rates.
- **Non-Random Failure Noise:** Repeater failures under certain interfaces caused higher false negative rates.
- **Misconfigurations:** Incorrect modem connections in the topology led to higher error rates.

Manual examination of the dataset indicated that insufficient failure instances were the most prominent cause of inaccuracy. Merging interfaces that rarely failed into one FG reduced the false positive rate to below 5%.

## 3. Modem Failure Estimation
As an application of NetworkMD, we demonstrate how to reduce the overhead of active probing by estimating modem failures. The process involves four steps:
1. **Monitoring:** NetworkMD monitors all modems to derive FG compositions.
2. **Probing:** A subset of modems is randomly selected for probing when a failure event is detected.
3. **Identification:** The greedy min-set-cover algorithm identifies responsible FGs.
4. **Estimation:** The combination of failure explanations and FG composition estimates the statuses of unprobed modems.

To evaluate the effectiveness, we partitioned the failure instance matrix \( X \) into training and testing datasets. We emulated probing 20% of the modems based on the testing dataset and estimated the failure statuses of the remaining 80%. The estimation error was measured as the ratio of mistakenly estimated modems to total unobserved modems. NMF-based methods achieved an estimation error as low as 5%, outperforming k-means, which had at least 7% error regardless of the training data size.

## 4. Related Work
### 4.1 Network Management Systems
Commercial systems like OpenView, SMARTS, and iGlass provide frameworks for monitoring and handling failures but can only discover failures of directly monitored devices.

### 4.2 Unobservable Metrics
Studies have used Bayesian reasoning, risk modeling, and other techniques to handle unobservable metrics. However, these approaches assume known relationships between events and causes, which is not always the case in our setting.

### 4.3 Topology Inference
Research in topology inference and discovery typically requires traceroute-like probing or access to BGP routing tables, which are not available in last-mile cable networks. Network tomography techniques, while useful, are not directly applicable to binary status indicators in cable networks.

## 5. Conclusions and Future Work
NetworkMD provides an unsupervised learning algorithm for creating FGs based on end-to-end failure patterns. It uses NMF and k-means, with the latter benefiting from geographic information. The framework is effective in both simulated and real-world settings. Future work includes combining FGs with geographic information for physical failure localization, flagging potential misconfigurations, and reducing the overhead of active probes.
