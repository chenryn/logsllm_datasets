provenance model for SDN control and data planes that fo-
cuses on SDN-speciﬁc dependency explosion factors (e.g., de-
fault ﬂow rule dependencies), and 2) relevant attack analy-
sis techniques of particular interest to network practitioners
(e.g., network summarization).
10 Conclusion
We presented PICOSDN, a provenance-informed causal ob-
servation tool for SDN attacks. PICOSDN leverages a ﬁne-
grained provenance model to allow practitioners to recon-
struct past control and data plane activities, to analyze them
for root causes when control plane attacks occur, to under-
stand the scope of attacks’ effects on other network activities,
and to succinctly summarize the network’s activities and evo-
lution. We evaluated PICOSDN using recent control plane
attacks, and we found that PICOSDN is practical for runtime
collection and ofﬂine analysis.
