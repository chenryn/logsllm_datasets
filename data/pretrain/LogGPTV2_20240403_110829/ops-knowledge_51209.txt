User:  How to optimize image size and operating efficiency when using Docker to build images?
Assistant: 1. Adopt a suitable base image: choose a minimal base image, and avoid choosing a base image that contains a large number of unnecessary components. 2. Use multiple RUN instructions: In this way, different operations can be stored in different image layers, so as to avoid excessive copying and damage effects in later operations. 3. Streamline unnecessary installation packages: After the installation is complete, delete unnecessary installation packages. 4. Use .dockerignore to ignore unnecessary files and folders: You can reduce the number of files in the build process, thereby reducing the size of the generated image. 5. Use cache in construction: that is, cache the pre-built image layer during construction for reuse next time. 6. Try to avoid using the latest tag: At different times, the content of the mirror can change like a tagged version, and versioned tags are a better choice. 7. The same program runs in multiple containers: Using tools such as Docker-compose or Swarm, the same program can be divided into multiple containers to run, reducing the operating efficiency of a single container.
