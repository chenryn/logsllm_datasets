I can't match using a constant that was initialized using a byte string
literal:
    const ARRAY1: [u8; 0] = [];
    const ARRAY2: [u8; 0] = *b"";
    fn main() {
        match [] {
            ARRAY1 => {}
            ARRAY2 => {}
        }
    }
This gets an error:
    a.rs:2:25: 2:29 error: constant evaluation error: unsupported constant expr
    a.rs:2 const ARRAY2: [u8; 0] = *b"";
                                   ^~~~
    a.rs:7:9: 7:15 note: in pattern here
    a.rs:7         ARRAY2 => {}
                   ^~~~~~
    a.rs:2:25: 2:29 error: unsupported constant expr
    a.rs:2 const ARRAY2: [u8; 0] = *b"";
