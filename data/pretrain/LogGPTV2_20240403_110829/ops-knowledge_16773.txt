I am trying to install the Leap Motion SDK into Enthought Canopy. The "Hello World" page on the Leap Motion documentation mentions that I need to place the following four files into my "current directory":
- `Sample.py`
- `Leap.py`
- `LeapPython.so`
- `libLeap.dylib`

However, I am unsure how to find my current directory. I have tried several approaches, including typing `python Sample.py` in the terminal, which returns the following error:
```
/Users/myname/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python: can't open file 'Sample.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```
I have also attempted to place the four files in the `MacOS` directory, but I still encounter the same error. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

**Suggested Solution:**

1. **Create a New Directory:**
   - Create a new folder on your computer and place the four files (`Sample.py`, `Leap.py`, `LeapPython.so`, and `libLeap.dylib`) inside it.

2. **Open the File with the Correct Python Interpreter:**
   - Right-click on `Sample.py` and select "Open With."
   - Choose `Python Launcher.app (2.7.6)` from the list. Ensure that this version of the Python Launcher matches the built-in Python version on your Mac.

If `LeapPython.so` is correctly constructed, the script should run successfully.

This approach should help you resolve the issue and get the Leap Motion SDK up and running in Enthought Canopy.
