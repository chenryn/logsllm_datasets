User: I am trying to install the leap motion sdk into Enthought Canapy. The page called Hello World on leap motion mentions i need to put these four files:
Sample.py, Leap.py, LeapPython.so and libLeap.dylib
into my "current directory". I don't know how to find my current directory. I have tried several things including typing into terminal "python Sample.py" which tells me:
/Users/myname/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python: can't open file 'Sample.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
I've tried to put the 4 files in the MacOS file, but it still gives me this error. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Assistant: Try this:
Put the four files into one folder.
Right click on the Sample.py until it says "Open with" and gives some choices.
Select Python Launcher.app (2.7.6) # This version of Python Launcher must match the Mac built in Python Version.
If your version of LeapPython.so is constructed correctly, it should run.
