Hi, when using it, simple switch the button up to xl one. When you try to
generate a prediction of words; it will simply never load regardless of what
all the other setting are on. Every other gpt2 model size works; expect the xl
one. Tried it on Android and Linux same problem and different browsers Firefox
and Google Chrome same problem nothing to with addons cause the same problem
occurs with them all off.
