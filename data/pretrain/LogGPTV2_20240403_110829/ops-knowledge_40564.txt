However, some popular web server software and their advantages and disadvantages are listed below for reference: 1. Apache HTTP Server Advantages: Widely used, high stability and security, many supported modules and plug-ins, and strong scalability. Cons: Relatively poor performance, high memory and CPU consumption. Applicable scenarios: small websites and internal company applications. 2. Nginx advantages: stable performance, low memory and CPU consumption, suitable for high concurrent requests, support reverse proxy and load balancing. Disadvantages: The configuration is more complicated, not all Apache modules are supported, and the documentation is relatively small. Applicable scenarios: high-performance websites and applications that handle a large number of HTTP requests. 3. Microsoft IIS Advantages: easy to use and manage, highly integrated with Windows operating system, supports multiple Web technologies and extensions. Cons: Does not support all operating systems and software, relatively little support for non-Microsoft applications. Applicable scenarios: applications and websites based on Windows servers 4. Lighttpd Advantages: stable performance, very low memory and CPU consumption, many supported modules and plug-ins, suitable for processing static content. Disadvantages: Not as rich in functions as Nginx and Apache, and does not support multiple process models. Applicable scenarios: Web servers with static content, suitable for handling a large number of concurrent requests. Comprehensive consideration, the choice of web server software needs to be determined according to specific business scenarios. For example, Lighttpd is suitable for sites that process static content, Nginx is suitable for high-concurrency web applications, and Microsoft is suitable for applications that need to support multiple web technologies and operating systems at the same time.
