It seems like you're encountering an issue while trying to activate a virtual environment on a Windows system. The `source` command is specific to Unix-like systems and won't work in a Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the issue:

### 1. Create the Virtual Environment
You have already created the virtual environment, which looks good. Just for reference, here are the steps you followed:

```sh
c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
The --no-site-packages flag is deprecated; it is now the default behavior.
Using real prefix 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python'
New python executable in venv\Scripts\python.exe
File venv\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg exists with different content; not overwriting
Installing setuptools.................done.
Installing pip...................done.
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows, you need to use the `activate` script located in the `Scripts` directory of your virtual environment. Here’s how to do it:

#### Using Command Prompt:
1. Open the Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```sh
   cd c:\testdjangoproj\mysite
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

#### Using PowerShell:
1. Open PowerShell.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```sh
   cd c:\testdjangoproj\mysite
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```

### 3. Verify Activation
Once activated, your command prompt should change to show the name of the virtual environment, like this:
```sh
(venv) c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>
```

### 4. Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues, consider the following:

- **Ensure Python and virtualenv are installed correctly:**
  - Check the version of Python and virtualenv:
    ```sh
    python --version
    virtualenv --version
    ```

- **Check the path to the `activate` script:**
  - Ensure that the `activate` script exists at `c:\testdjangoproj\mysite\venv\Scripts\activate`.

- **Execution Policy in PowerShell:**
  - If you are using PowerShell, ensure that the execution policy allows scripts to run:
    ```sh
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

- **Administrative Permissions:**
  - Sometimes, running the Command Prompt or PowerShell as an administrator can resolve permission issues.

### 5. Additional Notes
- You mentioned using Python 7, but the latest stable version of Python is currently 3.9. Please ensure you are using a supported version.
- The `--no-site-packages` flag is indeed deprecated and no longer necessary in recent versions of `virtualenv`.

By following these steps, you should be able to activate your virtual environment successfully. If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about the error messages you are seeing.
