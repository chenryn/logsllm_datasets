##### Description of the problem
In the latest version (r92) the stormtrooper collada model has an incorrect
boundingBox.  
I tried the BoxHelper:
    const box = new THREE.BoxHelper(object, 0xff0000);
    scene.add(box);
or a manual approach:
    const boundingBox = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(trooper);
    const size = boundingBox.getSize();
    const center = boundingBox.getCenter();
    const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(size.x, size.y, size.z);
    const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ wireframe: true, color: 0x0000ff });
    const box2 = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    box2.position.set(center.x, center.y, center.z);
    scene.add(box2);
Both approaches result in the model not being in the boundingbox:

I already figured out that this started with r87,  
r86 didn't have this issue:

example code:  
r86: `r86...stijndeschuymer:bounding-box-test`  
r87: `r87...stijndeschuymer:bounding-box-test-r87`
I'm currently trying to figure out what causes this, but I'm quite new to
three.js,  
so I'd highly appreciate it if someone pointed me in the right direction!
