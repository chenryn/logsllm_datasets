User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Domain controller virtualised? Today we suffered from a hard drive failure on an old server that was acting as a domain controller (Windows Server 2008). It was also sharing our printers and acting as a DNS server. Luckily, all the user files and folders were on a seperate server that's backed up to an external hard drive. 

As a side project of mine I have been gradually learning more about virtualisation. So now that I have got to rebuild our domain controller I wondered if it was a good time to move the DC to a virtual machine. 

We now have the following servers:


HP ProLiant DL360 G4 3.0GHz Xeon  4GB RAM. 73GB HDD.      x3
HP ProLiant DL360 G4 2.4GHz 3GB RAM. 292GB HDD
HP ProLiant ML110 G6 3.0GHz 8GB RAM. 250GB HDD


Currently the three DL360's have VMware ESXI 4.1 installed and the ML110 is the domain file server which is also running VMware vCenter server. 

Currently the only VM's that are in use are a couple of Windows XP machines that I converted to virtual machines as a test case. 

We have ~35 workstations all running Windows XP Pro SP3, 2 LAN Printers and a seperate server that's maintained by an outside contractor. 

The biggest issue with the domain has always been that users log in for about 2 minutes then move to another workstation (we are an animal hospital with nurses and vets all moving around the building), because of this the login time is almost always too long in the users opinion. To be fair 30 seconds does seem like a long time when there is a sick animal waiting on their attention!

So my question(s);


Would you stick with a domain or downgrade to a workgroup?
How would you use the hardware available if using a domain?
Anything glaringly obvious that will cause problems that I may have missed in relation to the hardware and VMware vSphere?

Assistant: Yeah, AD rocks for policy, security, and a whole slew of other benefits.
I'm partial to another virtualization platform; but ESXi works great; sounds like a good setup to me.
Might consider using thin clients instead of full workstation, and a terminal server (or two or three) backing them. Login time would be almost eliminated as they move around (their session would simply be redirect to the new thin client). 

Terminal Servers can be virtualized, and depending on what you're trying to accomplish exactly, VDI might be a better way to go (each user gets a VM with XP or Win7, a Terminal Server Gateway takes care of connecting the right user the to right VM).

MS even recently released a version of Windows just for turning old PCs into thin clients (so you don't have to buy new hardware until you want to). Though your DL380s are somewhat lacking in RAM, which would have to be remedied before going with Terminal Services.

If you're not familiar with Termainal Services (requirements, licensing, and benefits) you might want to get a consultant involved who can look at your situation more closely. It's a bit of a leap to make for a company your size, but the user experience and productivity benefits might easily make up for the costs.
