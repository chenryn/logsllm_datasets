hi,
i have a dialog with `autoScrollBodyContent={true}` and it works on a desktop.
but when opening the dialog on a mobile device (nexus6), the scrollbar is not
on the right edge of the dialog it is about 1cm inside the dialog. when using
the chrome-inspector you can simulate this behaviour with other small devices
too (iphone, etc).
when removing the style
    box-shadow: 0 14px 45px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25), 0 10px 18px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22); 
with the inspector, the scrollbar appears exactly on the right side of the
dialog. but the shadow disappears :-(
