TRUE STORY 
WHAT IS RED TEAMING 
The term originated within the military to describe a team whose purpose is to penetrate 
security of "friendly" installations, and thus test their security measures. The members are 
professionals who install evidence of their success, e.g. leave cardboard signs saying "bomb" 
in critical defense installations, hand-lettered  notes  saying  that  “your  codebooks  have  been  
stolen" (they usually have not been) inside safes, etc. Sometimes, after a successful 
penetration, a high-ranking security person will show up later for a "security review," and "find" 
the evidence.  Afterward, the term became popular in the computer industry, where the 
security of computer systems is often tested by tiger teams. 
How do you know you can put up a fight if you have  
never taken a punch? 
REASONS TO CONDUCT 
•
Real world test to see how you will hold up against a highly 
skilled, motivated and funded attacker 
•
The only type of testing that will cover a fully converged 
attack surface 
•
Impact assessment is IMMEDIATE and built to show a 
maximum damage event

RFID OVERVIEW 
RFID  TAG FREQUENCIES 
WHO USES IT? 
Legacy 125-kilohertz proximity technology is still in place at around 70% to 80% of all 
physical access control deployments in the U.S. and it will be a long time before that 
changes, says Stephane Ardiley, product manager at HID Global. 
WHO IS VULNERABLE? 
• Government facilities (contractors too) 
• Medical Facilities 
• Financial Institutions 
• Nuclear facilities 
• Power/Water Facilities 
• Education 
• List  is  endless….

RISK MITIGATION 
REMEDIATION/RISK MITIGATION 
•
Standard RFID asset protection/best practices 
•
Protection strategies of badge systems (physical and electronic) 
• Protection against blended threads/Red Team targeted attacks 
•
Custom card formats and Time To Reverse (TTR) 
•
Protect badge systems with VLANs, 2-factor authentication or isolation 
•
Training – Staff and Guards 
•
Log Monitoring – IPS?
