**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
Bug, specifically in the documentation.

**What is the current behavior?**
The documentation for Refs and the DOM states:
> The `ref` attribute takes a callback function, and the callback will be executed immediately after the component is mounted or unmounted.

However, when I create a stateful component like the following:

```javascript
class ScrollHelper extends React.PureComponent {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("ScrollHelper componentDidMount");
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log("ScrollHelper componentWillUnmount");
  }

  render() {
    console.log("ScrollHelper render");
    return <div ref={(obj) => console.log("ScrollHelper ref", obj)}></div>;
  }
}
```

and use it within an application, the observed behavior does not match the documentation. The log output is as follows:

1. **First Render:**
   - `ScrollHelper render`
   - `ScrollHelper componentDidMount`
   - `ScrollHelper ref`

2. **Data Changes Elsewhere in the App:**
   - `ScrollHelper ref`
   - `ScrollHelper render`
   - `ScrollHelper ref`

3. **Further Data Changes:**
   - `ScrollHelper ref`
   - `ScrollHelper render`
   - `ScrollHelper ref`

4. **Data Changes Causing Unmount:**
   - `ScrollHelper ref`
   - `ScrollHelper componentWillUnmount`

**What is the expected behavior?**
According to the documentation, I would expect the `ref` callback to be called exactly **two** times during the events above:
- Once (with the component instance) after `ScrollHelper componentDidMount`.
- Once (with `null`) before `ScrollHelper componentWillUnmount`.

Instead, the `ref` callback is being called every time the component re-renders, even though it is clearly the same component instance each time (as evidenced by the lack of additional `componentDidMount` logs).

**Which versions of React, and which browser/OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**
- **React Version:** 15.4.1
- **Browser/OS:** Not specified
- **Previous Versions:** Behavior in earlier versions is unknown.
