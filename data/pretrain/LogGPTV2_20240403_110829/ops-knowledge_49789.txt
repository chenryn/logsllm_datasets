User: I am on MAC 10.9 with XCode 4.6.3 and have command line tools installed
I am trying to compile pycrypto-2.1.0 using 
python setup.py build and getting following error


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ld: warning: ignoring file build/temp.macosx-10.6-intel-2.7/src/MD2.o, file was built for unsupported file format ( 0xcf 0xfa 0xed 0xfe 0x 7 0x 0 0x 0 0x 1 0x 3 0x 0 0x 0 0x 0 0x 1 0x 0 0x 0 0x 0 ) which is not the architecture being linked (i386): build/temp.macosx-10.6-intel-2.7/src/MD2.o

locate is giving 

$ locate libdnsinfo.dylib
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/usr/lib/system/libdnsinfo.dylib
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk/usr/lib/system/libdnsinfo.dylib
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS6.1.sdk/usr/lib/system/libdnsinfo.dylib

These path are also added to PATH.
Following is command and error

Any idea to fix this?
Assistant: Use libdns_services instead, libdnsinfo.dylib is no more supported by latest sdk.
