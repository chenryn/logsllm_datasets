### Abstract
This paper presents quantitative data on SMTP traffic to MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) based on packet traces taken in December 2000 and February 2004. The analysis reveals that the volume of email increased by 866% between these two periods. Local mail hosts utilizing DNS black lists generated over 470,000 DNS lookups, accounting for 14% of all DNS lookups observed at the CSAIL border gateway in 2004, compared to just 0.4% in December 2000. The distribution of the number of connections per remote spam source followed a Zipf-like distribution in 2004, suggesting that DNS black lists may be less effective in fully mitigating spam. We examined seven popular DNS black lists and found that 80% of identified spam sources were listed in at least one of these lists. Some DNS black lists are highly correlated, which should be considered when estimating the likelihood of a host being a spam source.

## 1. Introduction
Unsolicited bulk email, commonly known as "spam," constitutes a significant portion of internet email traffic [9]. One common technique to block spam is address-based filtering, where mail from hosts suspected of sending spam is rejected. Once identified, the IP addresses of such hosts are registered in centrally maintained databases, often referred to as DNS black lists (DNSBLs). These databases can be queried via standard DNS lookups, allowing mail recipients to deny emails from listed hosts.

Over the years, the number of DNSBLs has increased, each offering various lists of IP addresses based on different criteria, such as open relays, virus sources, or actual spam sources. In this paper, we first provide a classification of DNSBLs, highlighting their varying focuses and coverage. We then analyze SMTP and DNSBL traffic using packet traces from CSAIL, comparing data from 2000 and 2004.

Our key contributions include:
- Characterizing the incoming SMTP workload and resulting outgoing DNSBL workload between 2000 and 2004.
- Observing the distribution of spam sources, which follows a Zipf-like distribution in 2004 but not in 2000.
- Showing that 80% of spam sources identified in our spam traps are listed in some DNS black list, with some lists being highly correlated.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of DNS black lists and their use in combating spam. Section 3 describes our data collection methodology and dataset. Section 4 analyzes the membership and relationships of several black lists. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our results and discusses future work.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Mail Life-cycle
Email, including spam, is delivered through a series of mail transfer agents (MTAs). After composition, the sender's MTA transfers the email to the recipient's MTA, possibly through intermediate relays. The final MTA delivers the email to the recipient's mailbox. MTAs use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to relay mail, which includes mechanisms for weak authentication and authorization.

### 2.2 Black Lists
Initially, spammers used their own accounts to send spam, but this became easy to block. To evade detection, spammers began using open relays and, more recently, compromised client machines. Various lists of spam sources, called black lists, are maintained and used to filter out spam. These lists can be accessed via DNS, making them efficient and scalable.

We classify black lists based on their focus (e.g., RFC compliance, open relays, actual spam sources) and how aggressively they add addresses. Table 1 summarizes 31 widely used black lists, showing a significant increase in the number of black lists in use since 2000.

### 2.3 DNSBL Clients
DNS black list clients are typically built into MTAs or run as separate programs during final delivery. MTAs check DNS black lists to determine if the sending MTA is listed, and can refuse to accept the mail. Post-delivery filtering tools like SpamAssassin also use DNS black lists to score and filter spam.

## 3. Data
### 3.1 DNS Traffic
DNSBL-related traffic now constitutes a significant portion of DNS lookups at CSAIL. We define a DNS lookup as a series of packets related to a single domain name. We identify DNSBL-related lookups by examining DNS A queries and manually verifying the names. Table 2 summarizes the DNSBL-related DNS lookups, showing a substantial increase from 0.4% in 2000 to 14% in 2004.

### 3.2 Inbound SMTP Traffic
We use Bro to preprocess raw TCP packet traces, providing summaries of each TCP connection. We consider only established or rejected inbound SMTP connections. Inbound SMTP traffic to CSAIL increased significantly between 2000 and 2004, with the number of successful inbound SMTP connections increasing by 11.9 times. Figure 1 shows the number of inbound connection attempts per remote host, revealing a long-tailed distribution.

## 4. Analysis of DNS Black Lists
We examine the membership and relationships of several DNS black lists, finding that 80% of spam sources identified in our spam traps are listed in at least one DNS black list. Some lists, like SORBS and DSBL, are highly correlated, which should be factored into spam source likelihood estimates.

## 5. Summary and Future Work
In summary, our analysis shows a significant increase in spam traffic and DNSBL usage at CSAIL between 2000 and 2004. The distribution of spam sources follows a Zipf-like distribution, and 80% of identified spam sources are listed in DNS black lists. Future work will focus on further refining the classification of DNS black lists and exploring more advanced filtering techniques.
