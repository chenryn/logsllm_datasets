### bitsadmin setaclflag

The `bitsadmin setaclflag` command sets the access control list (ACL) propagation flags for a specified job. These flags determine whether the owner, group, discretionary access control list (DACL), and system access control list (SACL) information should be maintained with the file being downloaded.

#### Syntax
```shell
bitsadmin /setaclflag <job> <flags>
```

#### Parameters
- **job**: The display name or GUID of the job.
- **flags**: One or more of the following values:
  - `o`: Copy owner information with the file.
  - `g`: Copy group information with the file.
  - `d`: Copy discretionary access control list (DACL) information with the file.
  - `s`: Copy system access control list (SACL) information with the file.

#### Examples
To set the ACL propagation flags for the job named `myDownloadJob` to maintain the owner and group information with the downloaded files, use the following command:
```shell
bitsadmin /setaclflag myDownloadJob og
```

This command ensures that the owner and group information is preserved during the download process.
