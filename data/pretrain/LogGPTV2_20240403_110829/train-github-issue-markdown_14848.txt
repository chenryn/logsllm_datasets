## 📝 Provide a description of the new feature
Could you please add an option to FancyZones, that will let you remove the
displaying of the zone numbers when changing zones. A font type and size
option would be nice also, for those who wish to keep the display of zone
numbers. The numbers are a bit unsightly for those who appreciate skinning.
_What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the scenario
this would be used?_
## To improve the overall appearance of FancyZones. Zones are Zones, once they
are created, they don't need numbers to provide any additional functionality.
The zone colours and active zone is colour highlighted.
