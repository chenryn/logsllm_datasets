    struct Foo(T);

    impl Foo {

produces duplicate definition error for `foo`:
    test.rs:9:2: 9:13 error: duplicate definition of value `foo`
    test.rs:9       fn foo() {}
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~
    test.rs:6:2: 6:13 note: first definition of value `foo` here
    test.rs:6       fn foo() {}
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~
    error: aborting due to previous error
Since `Foo` and `Foo` are different types, it seems that their impls
should not be interfering with each other.
