If I use a SPAN tag with class="visible-xs" then I expect to get the element
visible only on extra small screens. This happens, but the problem is that it
is visible using display=block, thus if I put two SPAN tags like this next to
each other, they are on separate lines, instead of on one line. I probably
need it to remain display=inline, since it is a span, not div. Any chance to
workaround this? Any chance to get this fixed in bootstrap? Thank you
