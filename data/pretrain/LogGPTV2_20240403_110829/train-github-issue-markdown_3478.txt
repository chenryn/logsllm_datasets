When using a `<span>` tag with the class `visible-xs`, I expect the element to be visible only on extra small screens. This works as expected; however, the issue is that the element is displayed as a block, which causes multiple adjacent `<span>` tags to appear on separate lines instead of on the same line. 

Since `<span>` elements are typically inline by default, I would prefer them to remain as `display: inline` rather than `display: block`. Is there a way to work around this issue? Additionally, is it possible for this behavior to be corrected in Bootstrap? Thank you.
