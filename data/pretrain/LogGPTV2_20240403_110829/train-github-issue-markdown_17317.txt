Perhaps I overlooked it browsing through the json file but i didn't see
another means to achieve transparency and i'm not a fan of the acrylic effects
blurring factor or the fact that it turns off when the window is not selected.
The traditional console provides for a static opacity just like in most nix
envs, i'd hope it's just a matter of time before it's implemented here?
