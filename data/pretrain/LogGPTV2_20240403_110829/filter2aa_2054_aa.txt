Wireless Public Safety Data Networks  
Operating on Unlicensed Airwaves:  
Overview and Profiles

Updated – March 2007 
From the firefighters who died on 9/11 to the rescue workers struggling to help victims of Hurricane 
Katrina, recent crises have demonstrated that the absence of reliable and interoperable voice and 
data communications among public safety agencies is an urgent national dilemma.  While the need 
for voice interoperability among first responders is a fundamental and long-standing public safety 
issue that must be resolved in a timely manner, many communities across the nation have already 
begun to supplement their voice communication networks with wireless broadband data networks 
operating over unlicensed spectrum—most notably the 2.4 GHz “Wi-Fi” band.  
These cutting-edge mobile high-speed data networks complement voice systems and serve as a cost-
effective means to deliver applications such as streaming video for surveillance and disaster response, 
fast downloads of suspect mug shots or building blueprints, and access to public safety databases.  By 
providing first responders with more resources in the field—and reducing the time they need spend in 
the office – these wireless data networks act as a “force multiplier,” improving overall public safety. 
From TV to Public Safety  
America’s upcoming transition to digital television (DTV) offers the potential both to solve the 
voice interoperability problem once and for all, as well as to foster the development of high-
quality, high-speed wireless data networks, by freeing up valuable and desperately needed 
airwaves in the prime 700 MHz TV band spectrum.  These airwaves travel farther using less power 
and better penetrate through obstacles—which would significantly boost the quality and reduce the 
cost of deploying community, municipal, and regional wireless broadband networks which could be 
utilized for public safety.  Today, such networks primarily utilize the crowded 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band, 
which has less favorable propagation characteristics than the lower-frequency 700 MHz TV bands.   
The DTV transition involves the future use of two different sets of frequencies (channels) that are 
currently underutilized by TV broadcasting: channels 2-to-51 and channels 52-to-69.

After the DTV transition is complete, channels 2-to-51 will remain allocated to DTV. However, 
because an average of only seven full-power local TV broadcast stations operate in each of the 
nation’s 210 local TV markets, the TV band will continue to have many vacant, unassigned 
channels (known as TV “white spaces”) even after the DTV transition. Congress has recognized 
that opening vacant, unassigned channels between channels 2 and 51 for unlicensed access would 
foster the development of commercial and community wireless broadband networks as well as data 
networks for public safety agencies.  See below for profiles of jurisdictions that are currently 
utilizing wireless broadband data networks operating on unlicensed spectrum for public safety 
applications. Bipartisan bills directing the FCC to complete its long-standing proceeding to open the 
TV white spaces for unlicensed use (Docket 04-186) have been introduced in both houses of 
Congress. Senators John Kerry (D-MA) and Gordon Smith (R-OR) have introduced a Senate bill, 
and Representatives Jay Inslee (D-WA) and Nathan Deal (R-GA) have introduced a House bill, 
both entitled “The Wireless Innovation Act of 2007.” These bills resume last year’s bipartisan 
Congressional push to open up the white spaces (last year’s Senate bill was approved by the 
Commerce Committee, but failed to reach a full floor vote).   
At the completion of the DTV transition, channels 52-to-69 are set to be cleared of broadcasting 
entirely and reallocated for public safety agencies and for auction to commercial wireless services.  
Congressional budget legislation focusing on the DTV transition, passed in both houses in 2006, 
imposes a hard deadline of February 17, 2009 for the clearance of channels 52-to-69. According to 
the FCC’s current plan, 24 MHz, or four TV channels (63, 64, 68 and 69), will be allocated to 
public safety agencies in harmonized, nationally-contiguous bands that will be used primarily for 
interoperable voice communication between first responders of different jurisdictions. The rest of 
the channels are currently set to be auctioned to commercial wireless service providers.  
Several private enterprises, most notably Frontline Wireless, LLC, and Cyren Call, Inc., have 
proposed plans to utilize portions of this returned TV band spectrum to deploy nationwide 
wireless broadband networks for shared use by public safety and commercial services. These 
proposals operate from the principle that although public safety systems must be designed for 
peak demand, actual demand is, at most times, far below that.  Regardless of the strengths and 
weaknesses of the individual proposals, they show that public safety and commercial users can 
efficiently share physical networks, with public safety users getting priority, thereby ensuring 
adequate communications capacity in an emergency. This is not only an efficient use of wireless 
broadband spectrum, but it would also allow public safety to share infrastructure financed by 
commercial entities. Several jurisdictions profiled below have already demonstrated this 
efficiency using municipal and regional wireless data networks operating on unlicensed spectrum. 
As broadband data applications become an even more critical part of public safety 
communications, access to more and better spectrum and networks becomes critical. This can 
potentially come through proposals for nationwide networks on licensed spectrum such as those 
discussed above – or by allowing unlicensed access to the vacant TV channels between 2 and 51 
on a market-by-market basis for the development of community, municipal, and regional wireless 
broadband networks. The latter option holds the promise of opening up considerable amounts of 
prime spectrum, particularly in rural and small town markets, for both public access and for 
public safety, while not reducing the availability of returned 700 MHz spectrum for auction to 
commercial wireless providers. 
The following snapshots convey just a few examples of the multitude of ways in which 
communities around the country are already utilizing today’s extremely limited amount of 
unlicensed public airwaves below 3 GHz for public safety broadband data networks:

Examples of Public Safety Wireless Broadband Data Networks  
on Unlicensed Airwaves 
Corpus Christi, Texas 
Type of Implementation: 2.4 GHz Wireless Mesh Network 
Service Area: 147 Square Miles 
Application(s): see below 
Corpus Christi, a city of 293,000 located on the Gulf of Mexico, recently completed a 
multipurpose wireless broadband network. Public safety officers are among the primary users of 
the network. Indeed, the new network enables a multitude of applications to enhance public 
safety, including: 
• 
Aerial Video Surveillance: The city’s Aerial Video Surveillance is designed to enable 
officials to see a live aerial view of a situation—such as a major fire or sporting event—
or for routine surveillance. In such a system, an “eye in the sky” (a video camera 
mounted on a five-foot-long unmanned helicopter) transmits video images back to the 
ground via the city’s wireless mesh network.  
• 
Automated Vehicle Location: The city’s Automated Vehicle Location is deployed in 
140 of its police vehicles and 50 of its Fire and EMS vehicles. AVL uses global 
positioning system (GPS) technology to pin-point location, elevation, and velocity of 
these vehicles. Public safety officials can track the position of public safety vehicles on a 
map located at each dispatching station. 
• 
Emergency Disaster Response: Trailer-mounted communications towers that run on 
solar power are designed to be set up at the scene of a major accident or fire, or other 
disaster area that is located outside the reach of the city’s wireless network. These 
“towers on wheels” can link with the city’s network and provide public safety officials a 
way to use devices—such as handheld PDAs, emergency VoIP phones, and video 
surveillance cameras—in areas where communications infrastructure has been damaged. 
• 
Mobile Data Computers: More than 100 of the city’s public safety vehicles are 
equipped with mobile data computers. These computers use the city’s wireless network to 
run high-end applications such as in-car streaming video and car-to-car messaging. They 
also allow officials access to sex offender databases, mug shots, and satellite imagery.  
• 
Electronic Field Study: The city’s wireless network can allow police and fire officials to 
view images of a location—such as maps and building floor plans—in their vehicles, 
allowing them to make logistical decisions before they arrive at the scene.  
Washington, DC 
Type of Implementation: 700 MHz Wireless Broadband System on Experimental License 
Application: Mobile broadband access for law enforcement 
The District of Columbia has been piloting the Wireless Accelerated Responder Network 
(WARN) since January 2005.  Operating on the 700 MHz band utilizing an experimental license 
granted by the FCC, the system shows the potential benefits of deploying a network in the 
beachfront TV band spectrum.  No more than 120 access points are required to cover the entire 
District of Columbia with access to WARN, as compared to the approximately 37,000 sites that 
would be needed to cover the same area on the 4.9 GHz public safety licensed band.  WARN was 
implemented to test a host of broadband data applications for public safety.  These include 
creating ad hoc video surveillance networks in areas that need monitoring, broadband data access 
for squad cars and other mobile units, even remote analysis of suspicious packages using 
specially equipped HAZMAT suits. The network boasted 99.7% availability in 2005, and offers 
average connection speeds of 3 Mbps downstream, and 300 kbps upstream.  
San Mateo, California 
Type of Implementation: 2.4 GHz Wireless Mesh from Tropos Networks 
Application: Mobile broadband access for law enforcement 
San Mateo was the nation’s first municipality to use a citywide Wi-Fi network for public safety 
purposes. The mesh network provides police vehicles mobile access to critical law enforcement 
applications. Using laptops in their vehicles, officers have wireless broadband access to 
LAWNET, a county-wide Intranet for law enforcement that connects officers to the Amber Alert 
System, the Sex Offender Database and other databases. From anywhere in the hot zone, officers 
can now download DMV records, including high resolution photos, conduct in-field photo 
lineups, and perform other tasks that previously required them to return to headquarters. In the 
future, officers will have access to live video feeds of security cameras and access to the city’s 
Geographic Information System (GIS).  The network, operating entirely on unlicensed spectrum, 
is providing a significant return on investment by keeping police officers in the field 1.5 hours 
longer per shift.   
Morrow and Umatilla Counties, Oregon 
Type of Implementation: 2.4 GHz Proxim Tsunami Broadband Wireless Access System  
Service Area: 600 Square Miles in Morrow and Umatilla Counties 
Application: Public Safety First-Responders System 
In a county without a single traffic light, the Morrow County Emergency Management 
Department has built a 600-square-mile wireless broadband network to monitor the region 
surrounding the Umatilla Chemical Depot, a U.S. Army-built storehouse for the destruction of 
chemical weapons, in case of a disaster. The primary intent of the network is to coordinate 
evacuation and emergency responses in case of a major incident. Police will be able to view live 
video footage on laptops, divert traffic and organize evacuations. Emergency medical workers 
can send medical data to hospitals while en route and know ahead of time which hospitals can 
accommodate more patients. Though a hazmat emergency has not yet occurred, routine use of the 
network has caused an estimated 65 percent reduction in paperwork, as police use it to monitor 
traffic flow, communicate on the go with dispatchers, download data and file reports from the 
road, saving an estimated half of the 4,000 or so hours each officer spends on such bureaucratic 
tasks each year.  The ubiquitous network is also open free to the public – and for a moderate fee 
to businesses, providing a valuable service in sparsely populated northeaster Oregon. 
New Orleans, Louisiana 
Type of Implementation: 2.4 GHz Wireless Mesh from Tropos Networks 
Application: Unlicensed wireless surveillance camera network  
Prior to the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans decided to set up a real-time video 
surveillance network to monitor strategic
