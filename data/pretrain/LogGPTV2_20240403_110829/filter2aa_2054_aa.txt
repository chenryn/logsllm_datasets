#### Overview and Profiles

Recent crises, from the 9/11 attacks to Hurricane Katrina, have highlighted the critical need for reliable and interoperable voice and data communications among public safety agencies. While the necessity for voice interoperability among first responders is a long-standing issue, many communities across the United States have begun to supplement their voice communication networks with wireless broadband data networks operating over unlicensed spectrum, particularly in the 2.4 GHz "Wi-Fi" band.

These advanced mobile high-speed data networks complement existing voice systems and provide cost-effective solutions for applications such as streaming video for surveillance and disaster response, rapid access to suspect mug shots or building blueprints, and connectivity to public safety databases. By equipping first responders with more resources in the field and reducing the time they spend in the office, these wireless data networks serve as a "force multiplier," enhancing overall public safety.

### Transition from Television to Public Safety

The upcoming transition to digital television (DTV) in the United States presents an opportunity to address both the voice interoperability problem and the development of high-quality, high-speed wireless data networks. This transition will free up valuable and much-needed airwaves in the 700 MHz TV band, which offer superior propagation characteristics—traveling farther and better penetrating obstacles. This would significantly improve the quality and reduce the cost of deploying community, municipal, and regional wireless broadband networks for public safety. Currently, such networks primarily use the crowded 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band, which has less favorable propagation properties compared to the lower-frequency 707 MHz TV bands.

The DTV transition involves the reallocation of two sets of frequencies: channels 2-to-51 and channels 52-to-69. After the transition, channels 2-to-51 will remain allocated to DTV. However, due to the limited number of full-power local TV broadcast stations (an average of seven per market), many channels will remain vacant, known as TV "white spaces." Congress has recognized that opening these white spaces for unlicensed access could foster the development of commercial and community wireless broadband networks, as well as data networks for public safety agencies.

Bipartisan bills directing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to open the TV white spaces for unlicensed use (Docket 04-186) have been introduced in both houses of Congress. Senators John Kerry (D-MA) and Gordon Smith (R-OR) have introduced a Senate bill, and Representatives Jay Inslee (D-WA) and Nathan Deal (R-GA) have introduced a House bill, both titled "The Wireless Innovation Act of 2007." These bills build on last year's bipartisan efforts, with the Senate bill approved by the Commerce Committee but failing to reach a full floor vote.

Upon completion of the DTV transition, channels 52-to-69 will be cleared of broadcasting and reallocated for public safety agencies and auctioned to commercial wireless services. Congressional budget legislation, passed in 2006, sets a hard deadline of February 17, 2009, for the clearance of these channels. According to the FCC's plan, 24 MHz, or four TV channels (63, 64, 68, and 69), will be allocated to public safety agencies in harmonized, nationally contiguous bands, primarily for interoperable voice communication between first responders from different jurisdictions. The remaining channels are set to be auctioned to commercial wireless service providers.

Several private enterprises, including Frontline Wireless, LLC, and Cyren Call, Inc., have proposed plans to utilize portions of the returned TV band spectrum to deploy nationwide wireless broadband networks for shared use by public safety and commercial services. These proposals aim to ensure that public safety systems, designed for peak demand, can efficiently share physical networks with commercial users, with public safety users receiving priority. This approach not only optimizes the use of wireless broadband spectrum but also allows public safety to share infrastructure financed by commercial entities.

As broadband data applications become increasingly crucial for public safety communications, access to more and better spectrum and networks is essential. This can be achieved through proposals for nationwide networks on licensed spectrum, as discussed above, or by allowing unlicensed access to the vacant TV channels between 2 and 51 on a market-by-market basis. The latter option holds the promise of opening up significant amounts of prime spectrum, especially in rural and small-town markets, for both public access and public safety, without reducing the availability of returned 700 MHz spectrum for commercial auctions.

### Examples of Public Safety Wireless Broadband Data Networks on Unlicensed Airwaves

#### Corpus Christi, Texas
- **Type of Implementation:** 2.4 GHz Wireless Mesh Network
- **Service Area:** 147 Square Miles
- **Applications:**
  - **Aerial Video Surveillance:** Enables live aerial views of situations, such as major fires or sporting events, using a video camera mounted on an unmanned helicopter.
  - **Automated Vehicle Location (AVL):** GPS technology pinpoints the location, elevation, and velocity of police and Fire/EMS vehicles, allowing officials to track their positions.
  - **Emergency Disaster Response:** Solar-powered, trailer-mounted communication towers provide connectivity in disaster areas outside the city’s network, enabling the use of handheld PDAs, emergency VoIP phones, and video surveillance cameras.
  - **Mobile Data Computers:** Equipped in over 100 public safety vehicles, these computers run high-end applications such as in-car streaming video and car-to-car messaging, and provide access to sex offender databases and satellite imagery.
  - **Electronic Field Study:** Allows police and fire officials to view maps and building floor plans in their vehicles, aiding in logistical decision-making before arriving at the scene.

#### Washington, DC
- **Type of Implementation:** 700 MHz Wireless Broadband System on Experimental License
- **Application:** Mobile broadband access for law enforcement
- **Details:**
  - The District of Columbia has been piloting the Wireless Accelerated Responder Network (WARN) since January 2005, operating on the 700 MHz band with an experimental license from the FCC.
  - WARN demonstrates the potential benefits of deploying a network in the beachfront TV band spectrum, requiring only 120 access points to cover the entire district, compared to 37,000 sites needed in the 4.9 GHz public safety licensed band.
  - Applications include ad hoc video surveillance networks, broadband data access for squad cars, and remote analysis of suspicious packages using specially equipped HAZMAT suits.
  - The network offers 99.7% availability and average connection speeds of 3 Mbps downstream and 300 kbps upstream.

#### San Mateo, California
- **Type of Implementation:** 2.4 GHz Wireless Mesh from Tropos Networks
- **Application:** Mobile broadband access for law enforcement
- **Details:**
  - San Mateo was the first municipality to use a citywide Wi-Fi network for public safety, providing police vehicles with mobile access to critical law enforcement applications.
  - Officers use laptops in their vehicles to access LAWNET, a county-wide Intranet for law enforcement, connecting them to the Amber Alert System, Sex Offender Database, and other databases.
  - The network, operating entirely on unlicensed spectrum, keeps police officers in the field 1.5 hours longer per shift, providing a significant return on investment.

#### Morrow and Umatilla Counties, Oregon
- **Type of Implementation:** 2.4 GHz Proxim Tsunami Broadband Wireless Access System
- **Service Area:** 600 Square Miles
- **Application:** Public Safety First-Responders System
- **Details:**
  - The Morrow County Emergency Management Department has built a 600-square-mile wireless broadband network to monitor the region surrounding the Umatilla Chemical Depot.
  - The network coordinates evacuation and emergency responses, allowing police to view live video footage, divert traffic, and organize evacuations.
  - Emergency medical workers can send medical data to hospitals while en route and know which hospitals can accommodate more patients.
  - Routine use of the network has reduced paperwork by an estimated 65%, saving officers about half of the 4,000 hours spent on bureaucratic tasks each year.
  - The network is also open to the public for free and to businesses for a moderate fee, providing a valuable service in sparsely populated northeastern Oregon.

#### New Orleans, Louisiana
