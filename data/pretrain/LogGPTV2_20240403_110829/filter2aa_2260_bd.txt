The Northern Mariana Islands designated the entire Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) as its 
metropolitan area (area), which consists of a chain of 14 volcanic islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.  Of these 
14 islands, 3 are inhabited: Saipan, Tinian, and Rota.  However, about 90 percent of CNMI’s population lives on 
Saipan, which is the capital.

The Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) Working Group was established in 2005 to create the TICP 
and includes local and state agencies (e.g., public health, state police, Port Authority).  The area has a mix of formal and 
informal partnerships among agencies that would be supported by formalized agreements.  Although some preliminary 
planning has begun, CNMI does not have a strategic plan for interoperable communications in place.  Through federal 
grant funds, organizations within CNMI give some consideration to regional communications interoperability, but have 
faced considerable decline in local funding (e.g., pullout of garment companies, decline of tourism).  Despite the 
governance challenges the territory faces, with the mayor’s participation on the governance committee and the governor 
acting as the final decision-maker on interoperability decisions, the area’s leaders demonstrate that interoperability is a 
political and fiscal priority. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Clarify federal membership in the decision-making group (e.g., TICP Working Group), and document roles and 
responsibilities  
• 
Develop, document, and formalize agreements (e.g., signed memorandum of understanding [MOU] with defined 
roles and responsibilities) among all participating agencies relating to regional interoperability 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements (e.g., MOUs, intergovernmental agreements) in the TICP and store them in an 
accessible format 
• 
Establish a regular review process to ensure that agreements remain current and relevant 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational TICP) with participant 
approval, adoption, and acceptance, that takes into account a long-term communications funding strategy (beyond 
grants) 
• 
Align local and CMNI-wide strategic planning efforts to ensure regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term (e.g. 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding that is consistent 
with the strategic plan 
• 
Continue to champion a governance structure that will support regional communications interoperability, and 
involve senior regional government leadership on long-term funding plans

The Northern Mariana Islands incorporated existing policies and procedures (e.g., from the Civil Defense Office very 
high frequency [VHF] systems policies) into the TICP.  Since these SOPs were already well established and used 
frequently, the public safety agencies in the area were well positioned to adopt the TICP.  However, because the area’s 
previous SOPs relate to the old system, the area should take steps to ensure the TICP includes updated SOPs that relate 
to the new 800 megahertz (MHz) system.  The area has begun to disseminate these polices and procedures (e.g., 
distributed to dispatch centers, available with gateways) to participating agencies.  Because of the limited scope of the 
exercise, interoperable communications solutions were not always required, and participants were therefore unable to

demonstrate proficiency in executing all of the SOPs listed in the TICP (e.g., fixed gateway request not observed, 
mobile gateway request procedures not followed).  The area began implementing National Incident Management 
System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) less than 6 months ago, which implies that the area is still in the 
earlier stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures.  This fact was evident during the exercise, as the 
participants did not demonstrate familiarity with command and control processes (e.g., no incident command was 
established, incomplete and inaccurate ICS Form 205).  
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to distribute updated regional interoperability SOPs (e.g., document demonstrated exercise procedures not 
originally included in the TICP)  
• 
Develop training policies and requirements for inclusion in the TICP 
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises to SOPs (include TICP implementation of communications unit) 
and for NIMS/ICS to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS 
compliance

The CNMI regularly uses its shared 800 MHz system in day-to-day, task force, and mutual aid situations.  While 
proficient in daily use, during the TICP validation exercise, participants experienced difficulties in demonstrating 
familiarity and proficiency in a tactical response situation using CNMI’s interoperable communications equipment (e.g., 
radio cache and gateways).  Although the scope of the exercise was not sufficient to require the use of any interoperable 
assets, evaluators noted that when participants did attempt to communicate via the shared systems, “no solution was 
observed to compensate for the significant queuing noted,” and cellular and landline telephones communications were 
relied upon heavily. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of and procedures for territory’s interoperability resources (e.g., radio 
cache, gateway) to improve proficiency 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day 
activities

The CNMI operates an 800 MHz, trunked, Motorola SmartZone™ radio system that the Department of Public Safety 
(DPS), Emergency Management Office (EMO), Public Health, Department of Public Works, Customs and Border 
Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement use.  Repeaters are located on Mt. Tapotchao, a console and 
central electronics bank are located at DPS, and another console is located at EMO.  The Ports Authority, Utility 
Corporation, and Mayor's Office each run their own VHF radio systems.  CNMI incorrectly specified cache radios in its 
TICP.  The actual number of caches and the radios in them is unknown.   The SmartZone system is 14 years old, and 
Motorola no longer makes parts for it.  Furthermore, the CNMI jurisdictions are separated by large bodies of water, 
which makes reliable communications using their current system very difficult.  The need for interoperability is 
apparent and would be easier with much newer technology (e.g., T1 or microwave backhaul links).  CNMI would like to 
replace this system with a Project 25 system but does not have the funding for such an undertaking.

In March 2006, the Puerto Rico Communications Interoperability Committee (PRCIC) was established to 
develop the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) for the area.  The PRCIC has operational, 
technical, and training working groups that include municipal, commonwealth, and federal agencies.  The 
PRCIC is dedicated to developing interoperability across the commonwealth as a whole through strategic 
planning efforts.  Although there are currently only informal agreements and partnerships among public 
safety agencies in the area, beyond the operational focus of the TICP, the area is working toward 
implementing the formalized TICP and regional SOP.  The area does not currently base funding and 
equipment procurement decisions on regionwide interoperable communications goals, but is working to 
develop a more strategic, long-term funding plan.  Recently in the area, there has been a commendable 
movement toward improving interoperability with the establishment of the PRCIC, but the area does not 
have a sustained history of dedicated fiscal and political support for interoperable communications.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to support the decision-making group through regularly scheduled meetings and actively 
working issues to address regional (tactical and strategic) interoperability  
• 
Continue to document and formalize agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all 
participating agencies to achieve regional interoperability 
• 
Continue the interoperability strategic planning process toward the development and implementation of a 
strategic plan, with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance 
• 
Align regional and territorywide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional communications 
interoperability needs are met 
• 
Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term interoperability planning and sustainable 
funding 
• 
Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into a strategic plan, considering funding models 
(in addition to grants) that can leverage regional and territorywide strategic planning efforts 
• 
Involve additional political leaders in championing a governance structure that would more fully support 
territorywide interoperability

The area has the capability of using multiple interoperable communications methods for day-to-day 
operations, but reports infrequent use and flexibility for incident interoperability.  For example, during the 
exercise, the participants were able to demonstrate use of the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Agency 
(PREMA) gateway; however, EMS was not able to effectively communicate with the Fire Department.  The 
radio cache was not used, and the shared system was used to support Police and Fire on different talk groups, 
but not as an interoperability method.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional communications interoperability resources to 
improve proficiency (e.g., shared system, gateway)

The Puerto Rico Police Department (PRPD) currently owns the only two trunked systems on the island.  A Motorola® 
SmartNet II™ 800 megahertz (MHz) analog trunked system is supported by three tower sites and covers the City of San 
Juan and its vicinity.  An EF Johnson® MultiNet™ 800 MHz analog trunked system is supported by 11 tower sites and 
covers all the other municipalities in Puerto Rico.  Interoperability between the two systems is achieved by a fixed 
gateway and multi-protocol portable radios.  PRPD is the only user of these systems.  Most of the other public safety 
agencies are on very high frequency and ultra high frequency simplex systems.  The PRPD also owns a large number of 
fixed and mobile gateways.  Fixed gateways are installed at all the police regional headquarters for interoperability.  
Currently, these gateways are configured as standalone units.  However, there is a plan to interconnect the equipment 
for remote operation.  PREMA is currently acquiring a number of gateways as well.

The Virgin Islands Office of Homeland Security established a communications committee to oversee the 
development and implementation of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).  The 
committee has local, state, and federal representation, including administrators from St. Thomas, St. John, 
and St. Croix.  Although the area created regional SOPs in developing the TICP and organizations have 
accepted the plan, it is not yet in practice across the islands.  The area indicates that there is a strategic plan 
addressing funding and operations; however, it is unclear if there is a strategic plan that incorporates 
interoperable communications beyond the operational focus of the TICP operational policies and procedures.  
It appears that limited and fragmented interoperable communications funding plans exist today (relying 
primarily on grants); the area plans to align budget management and equipment procurement with strategic 
interoperability goals but has not demonstrated that a long-term plan is currently in place.  The area’s leaders 
have demonstrated an understanding of the importance of interoperable communications and are working on 
further developing political and fiscal support. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to support the decision-making group through regularly scheduled meetings and actively 
working issues to address regional (tactical and strategic) interoperability  
• 
Continue to involve territory and federal organizations in the decision-making group and document roles 
and responsibilities as part of group support territory wide interoperability 
• 
Document and put into practice the necessary interoperability agreements to ensure consistent 
communications plans 
• 
In addition to the TICP, continue to develop and document a strategic plan with participant approval,

The Virgin Islands has the capability to use shared channels and gateways on a daily basis.  Although the 
gateway solutions are frequently used, there remains but one equipment manager for the nine gateways 
across the islands.  Officials indicated that interoperable communications were effectively used during a 
recent real-world event.  During the exercise, evaluators witnessed some evidence that the practitioners were 
less than familiar with some of their interoperability assets and their use.  For example, the participants used 
the gateway but set it up in a location that could have impeded use.  The multidisciplinary use of shared 
channels and the shared systems was minimal, which may have resulted in the lack of seamless 
interoperability.  During the exercise, EMS was unable to communicate back to its dispatcher on either the 
EMS or mutual aid channels once they entered the Water and Power Authority gate.  As such, an effective 
use of the mutual aid channel was not demonstrated and the use of the channel never designated by the 
Incident Command.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources (e.g., resolve shared 
channel and gateway issues involving state and federal agencies) to improve proficiency 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Virgin Islands National Guard is transitioning from an 800 megahertz system to a VHF system.  The Virgin Islands 
Office of Homeland Security intends to establish a radio cache in the future.
