chosen source node S (i.e., TX = TSX + TXS). At the same
time, relying on the NetFlow data sets, we also obtain the
measured trafﬁc demand between each AS and the NetFlow
collector AS, the regional ISP from which the NetFlow data
was obtained.
Fig. 5(a) compares model-generated trafﬁc volumes
with NetFlow-derived trafﬁc volumes by showing volume
vs. rank distributions.5 In the case of the NetFlow-derived
volume measurements,
the trafﬁc demand starts to fall
steeply after rank 1000 or so, while the model-generated
demand does not. This deviation is likely due to a de-
ﬁciency of the type-1 Pareto distribution (used to model
Pweb and PRA) as suggested by Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 5(b),
we plot the cumulative trafﬁc demand ratio; i.e., we ex-
amine what percentage of the total trafﬁc demand the top-
x percent ASs are responsible for. The actual trafﬁc de-
mand ratios of the top-ranking ASs (up to rank 30 or so)
are matched well by our model, but for the same reason as
before, the generated demand ratios start to deviate consid-
erably from their actual counterparts when we include the
lower-ranking ASs.
Finally, to compare model-generated and actual demand
in terms of outbound and inbound trafﬁc proﬁles, we plot
in Fig. 6 for each node or AS X on the x-axis the volume
of trafﬁc from X to S, and on the y-axis the volume of
trafﬁc from S to X. Since we already know that our model
is inadequate for predicting small ASs’ trafﬁc demand, we
focus in the ﬁgure on the large ASs (i.e., top-1000 ASs in
terms of their total trafﬁc demand) to get an idea about how
well our model predicts the inbound/outbound trafﬁc for
the critical large ASs. Fig. 6(a) shows the proﬁle obtained
from using NetFlow measurements, while Fig. 6(b) de-
picts the proﬁle resulting from our model-generated inter-
domain demand. As the trafﬁc proﬁle of an AS moves fur-
ther below the diagonal line, its business proﬁle becomes
increasingly that of a web service provider. Conversely, an
AS whose trafﬁc proﬁle is located above the diagonal line
is a typical residential access provider. Comparing the two
proﬁles in Fig. 6, we see that the NetFlow-derived values
are comparable to their model-generated counterparts, with
less concentration around the diagonal, though.
To illustrate the effect of parameterization of our gravity
model (2), we consider the parameter β. which determines
how variable the transit quality of different networks is. A
high value of β means that the transit quality of the higher-
tier ASs is signiﬁcantly better than that of the lower-tier
ASs, and a low value of β implies a more uniform transit
quality. In an extreme case where β = 0, the transit quality

Path Length
Figure 7: Topological distribution of trafﬁc (ω = ρ = 1.0)
of all transit networks is considered the same. As described
in Section 5, the friction factor Fij, which is a function of
β, reﬂects the transit quality of the path bottleneck and is
thus a topological metric that depends on graph connectiv-
ity. To examine the effect of β in terms of its impact on the
topological distribution of trafﬁc demand, for a given path
length l, let Sl denote the total sum of trafﬁc exchanged
between every pair of ASs that are distance l apart. We are
interested in understanding how, depending on the param-
eter β, Sl changes with different path length l.
Fig. 7 shows the probability density functions of Sl for
different values of β. As β increases, the entire density
function is shifted to the left. Intuitively, in a high-β set-
ting, the total trafﬁc demand is more likely to be dominated
by the demand between close-by source-destination pairs;
demand between far-away pairs becomes negligible, (long
paths are more likely to encounter a bottleneck than short
paths and will be avoided). In short, a high-β setting im-
itates an Internet environment where trafﬁc demand tends
to be highly localized [22]. In contrast, in a low-β setting,
trafﬁc demand tends to be less sensitive to the bottleneck
quality between source and destination, resulting in distant
source-destination pairs exchanging non-negligible amount
of trafﬁc.
Besides the parameter β, we also examine the pairwise
rank correlation matrix Στ = {τij} and study the trafﬁc
proﬁles resulting from different degrees of rank correlation.
As expected, increasing pairwise rank correlation results
in higher correlation between outbound trafﬁc associated
with web hosting utility and inbound trafﬁc attributed to
residential access utility. Due to space limitation, we do
not include the detailed results.
7 Conclusions
The Internet AS environment is a setting where establish-
ing “ground truth” is notoriously difﬁcult. For example,
while it is relatively easy to infer AS maps of the Internet
from publicly available BGP-derived data, the underlying
measurements are known to provide only a very incomplete
picture of Internet connectivity at the AS-level [5]. In turn,
this creates signiﬁcant challenges for accurately modeling
the Internet’s AS topology and large unresolved problems
as far as validating the resulting models is concerned.
In this paper, we are concerned with an even more elu-
sive aspect of the Internet’s AS environment, namely the
AS-level trafﬁc matrix giving the trafﬁc demand between
any pair of connected ASs. For one, there exists no equiva-
lent of the publicly available BGP-derived data, and this
has led researchers to pursue a mostly model-based ap-
proach. Even worse, for fear of losing competitive ad-
vantage, ASs are very reluctant to provide any AS-related
data. As a result, AS-speciﬁc trafﬁc data is by and large
not publicly available, causing researchers to look for “sur-
rogate” measurements that are publicly available or obtain-
able (i.e., via measurement experiments that can be per-
formed by anyone connected to the Internet) and that may
shed some light on the nature of the actual inter-AS trafﬁc
demand. As far as model validation is concerned, this sit-
uation causes nightmares, because on top of examining the
validity of a proposed model, it ﬁrst requires checking that
the considered surrogate measurements are indeed suitable
and relevant as substitutes for the largely unavailable data.

Notes
1Recent years have seen accelerated migration of dialup modem users
to broadband subscription and, according to some recent statistics, DSL
subscription in the US nearly doubled in 2003 (point-topic.com).
2Since trafﬁc on the FastTrack/KaZaA network has declined sharply
in the past few years and continues to decline, we did not include it in our
study.

5The random parameterization of κw and κr reﬂect AS-dependent
variations of trafﬁc components.
By developing a ﬂexible approach to generating inter-AS
trafﬁc matrices, we make four speciﬁc contributions:
1. Identiﬁcation of relevant surrogate measurements that
are publicly obtainable/available;
2. Derivation of AS-speciﬁc statistics from the measure-
ments in 1 that are the key inputs to a general gravity
model for inter-domain trafﬁc demand;
3. Generation of inter-domain trafﬁc demand from the
gravity model in 2 that are not obviously inconsistent
with actual demand;
4. Methodology for validating AS-level trafﬁc demand
models that puts to good use the few and rare pro-
prietary data sets that some ISP have been willing to
share with the networking research community.
While many of the speciﬁc details of our approach can
be questioned and much room for improvements exist,
we have demonstrated that overall, it is not only feasible,
but also generates realistic inter-AS trafﬁc demand with
Internet-like characteristics. The chosen parameterization
makes our model an attractive object for exploring “what-
if” scenarios; by relating it to recent successful attempts at
modeling intra-AS trafﬁc demand, our model provides an
initial framework within which one can start exploring the
impact of intra-AS trafﬁc engineering on inter-AS trafﬁc
engineering and vice versa.
