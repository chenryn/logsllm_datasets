Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of spawning an instance on a hypervisor. The instance sync for the host was not matching, so the InstanceList was re-created. The image was checked and found to be in use on the node. An active base file was identified. The instance was then plugged into the network and resumed. Finally, it took 20.80 seconds to build the instance.
