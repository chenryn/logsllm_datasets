ABSTRACT 
We motivate a new line of image forensics, and propose a novel 
approach  to  photographer  identification,  a  rarely  explored 
authorship  attribution  problem.  A  preliminary  proof-of-concept 
study shows the feasibility of our method. Our contribution is a 
forensic  method  for  photographer  de-anonymisation,  and  the 
method also imposes a novel privacy threat.

1  INTRODUCTION 
We consider such a research problem: given a single photo, how 
to determine who was the cameraman? This is in general a hard 
problem,  except  for  selfies  and  except  if  the  photographer’s 
shadow became visible in the photo or her image was captured 
by a reflective object in the photo, such as a subject’s eyes.  
This problem is interesting to intelligence agencies. For example, 
a photo of a secret military facility in Russia can be valuable to the 
Central Intelligence Agency of USA. However, when the photo gets 
leaked by a mole inside the CIA, Russia’s anti-spy operatives would 
be keen to work out who took the photo in the first place.  
The problem is interesting to law enforcement agencies, too. For 
example, when the Scotland Yard are tipped off by a photo from an 
anonymous source that offers clues to a criminal investigation, it is 
likely to gain further information to accelerate their investigation by 
identifying the person behind the camera. 
Moreover, the problem is also interesting to privacy researchers. 
The  answer  to  the  research  question  will  likely  provide  novel 
methods of privacy intrusion by de-anonymising a photographer of 
any concerned photo on the Internet, and motivate novel research 
for protecting photographers’ anonymity.  
Not all photographers care that it is public knowledge that some 
photos  are  taken  by  them.  But  in  some  circumstances,  some 
photographers would care if some photos are linked to them as the 
people behind the camera.  
From the forensic perspective, a technique that does not identify 
the  photographer  100%  of  the  time  can  still  be  practically  useful,

since 
Complemented with other  means  such  as  surveillance, it is highly 
likely for intelligence agencies or law enforcements to pin down the 
concerned photographer accurately.  
We first review related work, and show that existing approaches 
do  not  resolve  the  research  question  we  are  asking.  Then,  we 
propose a new approach, and demonstrate its feasibility by a proof-
of-concept but realistic simulation study. Our method is applicable 
to both digital and film photography, in theory. 
2  RELATED WORK 
Visual stylometry. Artists like Claude Monet and Vincent van 
Gogh  demonstrate  distinctive  styles  in  their  paintings.  In  the  past 
hundreds  of  years,  people  relied  on  stylistic  analysis  to  tell  apart 
genuine fine art from fakes. It became an emerging research area in 
recent  years  to  apply  signal  processing  and  machine  learning 
methods to analyse painting images for artist identification [1, 2]. 
Similarly,  some  photographers  display  peculiar  styles  in  the 
photos  they  produce.  For  example,  widely  regarded  as  one  of  the 
best portrait photographers of all time, Yousuf Karsh is known for 
distinctive features in his portraits due to lighting, composition and 
posture.  Ernst  Haas  showed  a  distinctive  personal  style  in  his 
impressionist  colour  photography,  too.  Therefore,  it  is  a  natural 
extension  to  develop  photographer  identification  methods  from 
painting artist identification.  
However, a training set of photos a priori, usually of a large size, 
is  needed  for  each  concerned  photographer  to  make  machine 
learning  methods  to  work.  This  approach  will  hardly  work  if  the 
given  photo  is  the  only  available  one  taken  by  a  suspect 
photographer, since it is impossible to collect a training set of photos 
for the photographer. On the other hand, if a photographer’s style is 
not sufficiently sophisticated, it is easy for somebody else to emulate. 
This  can  be  exploited  to  fool  machine  learning  algorithms,  and  to 
frame a photographer.  
Camera fingerprint [3,4]. CCD or CMOS imaging sensors are a 
digital camera’s heart. Due to sensor design and imperfections of the 
sensor manufacturing process, systematic artefacts (usually known 
as sensor pattern noises) form an equivalent of a digital fingerprint 
that  can  identify  a  camera.  Such  fingerprints  are  intrinsically 
embedded in each image and video clip created by a digital camera. 
Forensic  applications  of  camera  fingerprints  include  1)  source 
camera  identification  (which  camera  was  used  to  produce  this 
image?),  and  2)  device  linking  (were  two  images  produced  by  the 
same camera?).  
Camera  fingerprint,  in  theory,  can  link  a  photo  to  a  specific 
camera, if a reference fingerprint can be established for the camera, 
e.g.  when  the  camera  is  physically  accessible,  or  a  set  of  photos 
taken by the same camera is otherwise available. However, camera 
fingerprint  does  not  link  a  photo  to  a  specific  user  of  the  camera. 
This  is  an  issue  when  the  same  camera  has  been  used  by  many 
people.  Moreover,  camera  fingerprint  can  be  easily  removed  from 
each photo, entirely disabling its forensic applications. The camera 
fingerprint technique has been developed for digital cameras, and it 
does not work for traditional film photography.  
Image  metadata  has  a  limited  forensic  application.  For 
example, it can link a digital image to a camera model at most, not to 
a specific camera, let alone a photographer. On the other hand, film 
photography does not produce any such metadata.  
All the methods discussed above do not really provide a solution 
behind  the  wall.  The  camera’s  angle  of  view  is  90°,  which  many 
lenses  can  achieve  in  photography,  and  the  camera  is  oriented 
towards the corner formed by the floor and the wall. 
The  ground  and  wall  surfaces  are  flat  and  modelled  with 
ambient-light  and  diffuse-light  coefficients  of  0.1  and  0.9, 
respectively. The resolution of the rendered scene is 1600x900 pixels. 
The  bit  depth  is  16  bits  per  colour  channel,  in  RGB  format;  this 
allows minimizing numerical errors.  
The photos P1 and P2 are acquisitions of the underlying 3D scene 
described above, from the point of view of the camera, taken with 
and  without  the  presence  of  the  photographer,  respectively. 
Accordingly,  every  picture  is  a  rendered  version  of  the  scene 
computed through the POVRay software.
