more pronounced for client-facing IP addresses (90th percentile =
6150 pkts, 95th percentile = 8187 pkts). Recall that we identified
some 87% of all logged traffic to be related to scanning activity
(Section 4.3). Thus, the additional traffic that the CDN telescope
logs is mostly related to scans — the result from localized scans, as
we will show in the next section.
7.2 Baseline Composition
Impact of scanning on baseline radiation: Our findings from
both our telescope as well as from the UCSD darknet show that vir-
tually all IPv4 addresses receive a baseline of roughly 3000 packets
on a daily basis, as of November 2018. With our tools to detect and

ground radiation: The baseline of unsolicited traffic re-
duces by some ≈90% when removing packets resulting from
Internet-wide scans, while localized spikes persist.
characterize scanning activity in hand, we now re-visit this obser-
vation. Figure 12 shows our four example CDN machines featured
in Section 3. Here, we show both the packet totals on client-facing
and on operations IP address, as well as after filtering out source
IP addresses that carry out full or partial Internet-wide scans (we
exclude source IP addresses that have a Pearson r > 0.7 over the
entire time period). Here, we can see that the traffic logged by the
two machines on top (only baseline radiation) reduces by more
than 90%, leaving only some 10% of logged packets that can not
be attributed to Internet-wide scanners. The bottom-left example
shows CDN-agnostic spikes, and we note that removing random
scan activity shifts the number of logged packets by some ≈ 2.8K
packets, but that the spikes remain visible; they are not part of
random scans. The last example shows that the baseline radiation
received on the operations interface mostly cancels out when re-
moving scanners, while CDN-targeted packets remain visible, yet
again shifted by some ≈ 2.8K packets.
Baseline and position in the address space: We conclude with
the following observations: (i) Routed IPv4 addresses receive a
baseline of some 3000 packets on a daily basis as a result of Internet-
wide scans of the IPv4 space. Thus, when seen on a per-IP basis, a
large majority of background radiation in today’s Internet is a result
of such scanning activity, and the positioning of the vantage point
in the IPv4 space does not affect this baseline. (ii) We see localized
scanning activity that we can clearly separate from the baseline
caused by Internet-wide scans. The visibility of localized scanning
activity is heavily dependent on the location of the telescope IP
addresses in the IPv4 space.
7.3 Long-term Baseline Evolution
In this study, we focus on the month of November 2018. While
our findings of the baseline scan radiation are remarkably stable
over the course of this month, we next ask if this observation holds
on longer timescales and/or if there are long-term trends when it

isolate, and characterize scanning activity allow for separation of
these scanning types. Our metrics, e.g., to track randomness of
scans, are general and could be leveraged to dissect background
radiation in other vantage points as well.
Threat identification: Our finding that most background radia-
tion a typical IPv4 address receives relates to scanning activity, and
that there is a relatively steady level of baseline scanning activity
has practical value both for researchers as well as network opera-
tors. We find that virtually any routed IPv4 address can expect to
receive baseline scan radiation day-in-day-out. We believe that cur-
rent levels of baseline scan radiation can easily be determined, be
it from telescope datasets available to the research community [2],
or—given its largely even distribution across the address space—
even from background radiation gathered from a smaller number
of machines. Once a baseline radiation level is established, network
operators can readily determine if their individual hosts or infras-
tructure receive significantly higher levels of radiation and scan
activity, indicating that they might indeed be the target of localized
scans. An operator could adapt our method and partition addresses
into buckets (not necessarily /8s, but could be, e.g., routed prefixes,
or addresses of the network’s infrastructure versus those of clients,
or of peering or customer networks), and then leverage our method
to assess randomness, and definitively detect scans that are focused
on subsets of their network.
8.2 Future Work
Understanding localized scans: Our finding of widespread local-
ized scanning activity begs the question of what are the root causes
of this activity. Our distributed vantage point clearly shows that
many of these scans target narrow regions of the address space,
when compared to Internet-wide scans, and yet we do not have def-
inite knowledge of the full extent of selected targets of these scans
across the entire IPv4 space. While proportionality is a reasonable
assumption to assess coverage for partial Internet-wide scans; a
broad range of activity is plausible for localized scans, and open for
further research. So far, we have classified locality of scan target se-
lection by routed prefixes and ASes. Leveraging other external data,
such as IP hitlists, and data gathered from honeypots, could further
illuminate localized and stateful target selection strategies. Further,
we propose to study long-term characteristics (e.g., months) of indi-
vidual source IP addresses. We have shown widespread evidence of
repeated, and sometimes changing, activity of scan sources. Long-
term behavioral analysis could shed further light on root causes for
scan activity (e.g., botnet infections vs. repeated targeted scanning
campaigns). Unsolicited IPv6 traffic, currently a small fraction of
the probing traffic, is more likely due to responses from forward
DNS queries (as comprehensive scanning of the IPv6 address space
is not practical), and could become significant with the growth of
IPv6 connectivity, which we plan to assess.
Correlating scans and cyberattacks: Our vantage point has the
attribute that it both elucidates scanning activity, but is also subject
to cyberattacks day-in-day-out. Visibility into both activities could
provide the rare opportunity to track both the scanning of IPv4
space for newly discovered vulnerabilities, as well as subsequent
cyberattacks carried out by infected devices.

comes to baseline radiation. Figure 13 shows, for three years, the
daily average number of packets logged at the firewall of each CDN
server on each public-facing IPv4 address. Since we are interested
in a robust estimate of baseline radiation, we show the median,
as well as the 25th and 75th percentile, removing machines that
received significantly more or less traffic than the average case.
Over the course of three years, we see a 3-fold increase in baseline
activity, starting from ≈ 1000 packets in early 2016, to some ≈ 3100
in December 2018. There is a pronounced spike in late 2016, early
2017. This spike coincides precisely with the widespread infections
of the Mirai botnet, which resulted in increased scanning activity,
evidenced in another network telescope [8]. Mirai activity leveled
off in 2017, but we see a steady increasing trend of baseline radiation
over the course of the next 1 1/2 years. If trends of the last years
continue, we can expect overall scanning activity, and the resulting
baseline radiation, to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.
8 DISCUSSION
In this section, we first discuss pertinent implications of our work
for researchers and network operators, and introduce avenues for
future work.
8.1 Implications
Our work has implications both for the research community, as
well as practical implications for network operators.
Interpretation of scan data: The perhaps most important finding
of our work is the evidence of widespread localized scanning activ-
ity in today’s Internet. Such scans pose a potentially greater threat,
since these scanning actors may target individual networks and
hosts, as opposed to Internet-wide scans, which is an important con-
sideration, e.g., when leveraging darknets to track phenomena such
as Botnets or exploitation of vulnerabilities (e.g., [8, 12, 20]). While
darknets, especially large ones, provide excellent visibility into ran-
dom scanning activity, we find that they severely underestimate the
number and volume of localized scans carried out, and may miss
the sources behind these scans entirely. Even when leveraging live
vantage points for monitoring scanning traffic, such as our CDN
telescope, potentially dangerous scans such as on ports 8291 and
7547 (recall § 6.2) would not stand out in aggregated statistics, but
only become visible once we identify and isolate localized scans as
a distinct category. Our introduced tools and metrics to identify,
