I wonder if you could combine a built-in support for RTL languages.  
You can require users to add the class rtl the body tag and accordingly change
the necessary parts in the system.
Example body tag:  
Example css rule:  
body.rtl {  
direction: rtl;  
}  
body.rtl .navbar .nav > li {  
float: right;  
}
