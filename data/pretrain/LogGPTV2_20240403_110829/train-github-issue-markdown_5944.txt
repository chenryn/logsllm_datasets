Hi
a bunch of examples seem to be missing `import numpy as np`. At least for me
they throw `NameError: name 'np' is not defined`.
Following examples seem to be missing `import numpy as np` (non exhaustive):
  * scipy.signal.spectrogram
  * scipy.signal.periodogram
  * scipy.signal.welch
`scipy.__version__` gives `1.4.1`. However, the examples seem to be the same
in the current master.
Maybe I am missing something? Any help is appreciated!  
Thanks :)
