Assistant: You won't get there from here.

Either make sure that your version, edition and operating system are the same as the client. If so, you may get away with doing a restore from a physical copy of the data files (DBF) and control files.

If not, you are best off asking for a database export (either old-fashioned exp, or preferably a datapump export). That is a 'logical' copy of the tables/data etc and it is much easier to pull that into a different environment.
