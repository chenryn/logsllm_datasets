We have an issue with some of our run scripts that utilize the "start" command
and have isolated it to the changes in 1809 vs 1803. This seems to be
different from the other issues that have been identified.
Specifically, when using `start` to call a command/program that exists in a
directory other than the current, calling directory, and using the `/min` or
`/max` parameters, the command/program is not found. Providing an explicit
path to the command fixes this.
Example:
In 1803, the following command worked.
    start /D "%PROGRAMFILES%\IIS Express" /min iisexpress.exe /path:%WEBPATH% /port:%WEBPORT%
In 1809, it says that the command or program `iisexpress.exe` cannot be found.
Removing /min fixes this. Running the command from the IIS Express folder
fixes this. Adding the IIS Express folder to the `%PATH%` fixes this. To me
this highlights another issue in the implementation of the /min flag in 1809,
that it does not seem to be searching for commands in the directory provided.
After further testing it seems that any command prompts open or commands that
are available which run from the `start`ed process are successfully executed
in the target path. For instance, passing in `dir` to `start` successfully
outputs the IIS Express directory in the new window.
I'm wondering if there is a difference in how the 'command' is being
processed. That is, if it was previously being processed as a _command_ but
now it's being processed as a _program_ , and it can't find the 'program' in
the local directory. If so IMO this is a breaking change to the functionality.
One option would be to add a flag (that I've not been able to find in the
directory) of hard-defining the provided 'command as a _command_ instead of a
_program_. Another would be a flag that allows the path for not finding a
target _program_ to fall through into executing as a _command_. Lastly, the
code for detecting if the _program_ exists should prepend the target path to
it, either by default or with a flag. This is all speculation though, as I
can't see the source.
