User: I'm using Python in Terminal on Mac OSX latest. When I press enter, it processes the code I've entered, and I am unable to figure out how to add an additional line of code e.g. for a basic loop.
Assistant: The answer here is far more simple. If you want to continue in the next line after a loop like 
while b<1:
when you press enter you get prompted with 
...
then you "have to make an indent" by space of tab and only then you can put more code after the three dots like
...   (tab or space)   print b
then when you press enter the code is not going to be executed but you get another ... where you can keep typing you code by making the new indent
keep the indent the same
that is it
