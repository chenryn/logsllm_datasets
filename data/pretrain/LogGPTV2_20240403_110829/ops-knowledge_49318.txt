User: I am working on a website that I want to host on App Engine. My App Engine scripts are written in Python. Now let's say you could register on my website and have a user profile. Now, the user Profile is kind of extensive and has more than 50 different ndb properties (just for the sake of an example).
If the user wants to edit his records (which he can to some extend) he may do so through my website send a request to the app engine backend.
The way the profile is section, often about 5 to 10 properties fall into a small subsection or container of the page. On the server side I would have multiple small scripts to handle editing small sections of the whole Profile. For example one script would update "adress information", another one would update "interests" and an "about me" text. This way I end up with 5 scripts or so. The advantage is that each script is easy to maintain and only does one specific thing. But I don't know if something like this is smart performance wise. Because if I maintain this habbit for the rest of the page I'll probably end up with about 100 or more different .py scripts and a very big app.yaml and I have no idea how efficiently they are cached on the google servers.
So tl;dr:
Are many small backend scripts to perform small tasks on my App Engine backend a good idea or should I use few scripts which can handle a whole array of different tasks?
Assistant: Adding to Dan Cornilescu’s answer, writing/saving an instance to the database re-writes to the whole instance (i.e. all its attributes) to the database. If you’re gonna use put() multiple times, you’re gonna re-write the who instance multiple times. Which, aside from being a heavy task to perform, will cost you more money.
