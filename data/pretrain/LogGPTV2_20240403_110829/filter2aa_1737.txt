Caveats
• Virtually all research in this area assumes that the 
attacker has already managed to infect at least one host
• Attacker has physical or near-physical access
• Exfiltration is of small pieces of data
PwC
Previous research
• Van Eck phreaking – e.g. Kuhn (2003); Halevi and Saxena (2012)
• AirHopper (Guri et al 2014) – radio frequencies
• BitWhisper (Guri et al 2015) – heat
• VisiSploit (Guri et al 2016) – codes & camera
• Fansmitter (Guri et al 2016) – acoustic
• SPEAKE(a)R (Guri et al 2016) – speakers to mics
• xLED (Guri et al 2017)
• Hasan et al (2013) – great overview of techniques
• Including ALS for mobile devices
• Lots more!
PwC
ALS
• Ambient Light Sensor
• Increasingly common
• Laptops
• Monitors
• Smartphones
• Tablets
• Smartwatches
PwC
Design
• The plan:
• Create malware to read light (lux) values from the ALS through 
the API
• Malware executes different commands according to changes in 
the intensity
• Problems:
• Hurr durr, I’ll just shine this massive torch onto my laptop to 
execute commands
• Need exfil capability

• Hanspach and Goetz (2014)
• Used system designed for underwater communication
• Covert acoustical mesh networks

Soundcard woes

Soundcard woes
• Apply multiple fade-ins / fade-outs
• Then amplify the track:

Mitigation
• TEMPEST standards
• Remove/disable ALS
• Screen filters
• White noise
• Ultrasonic detectors
• Disable microphones/speakers
Part II
Surveillance and counter-surveillance
•
Laser microphone
•
Passive infrared motion detector
•
Drone to clone to pwn
•

•
Active infrared motion detector
PwC
Laser microphone
PwC
Completed listener and laser units

But that music choice though
I love the sound of 
sound converted to 
light and then 
converted back to 
sound again in the 
morning.

PwC
Sniffing, analysing and cloning IR signals
• Similar principle to RF signals
• Assuming fixed codes (not rolling)
• Need to listen to the signal
• Analyse
• Replay the cloned signal on an Arduino
• See Major Malfunction (2005) – compromising hotel 
payment systems via infrared TV remotes
PwC
Sniffing the signal
• Use an RTL-SDR
• rtl_ir
• Forked from librtlsdr
PwC
Sniffing the signal
• IR receiver and Arduino
• IRLib library
PwC
PwC
Analysis and replay
PwC
Analysis and replay
• If signal is a known protocol, can just play back the code
• e.g. standby signal from my TV remote:
• NEC 0x2FD48B7
PwC
Analysis and replay
• If signal is unknown, read edges/delays into an array using 
IRLib or IRremote library
• Play array back
PwC
Passive IR motion detectors
• Bypasses – see Porter and Smith (2013)
• Move slowly
• Mask body heat
• Overwhelm sensor with heat (like a lighter)
• False alarms

Mitigation
• Vibrations/speakers/wire screens/coverings on windows
• Double-glazing or curved glass can cause problems
• Where possible, use alarms with physical keypads to disarm, not 
remotes
• If using remotes, go for ones which: 
• Use encrypted rolling code algorithms, anti-jamming, etc
• Are paired uniquely to a device
Part III

Annoying malware analysts

AstroDrone
PwC
Delayed Auditory Feedback (speech jamming)
• Has been around since the 1950s
• SpeechJammer - Kurihara and Tsukada (2012)
• I built a software version
PwC
Speech jamming
PwC
Demotivating malware analysts
• Inspired by Domas (2015)
• “Psychological warfare in reverse 
engineering”
• Created malware where the flow graph in 
disassemblers represents an image

PwC
AstroDrone
• Many drones have ultrasonic altimeters
• I’ve demonstrated with the Parrot AR 2.0
• But any drone with an ultrasonic altimeter is likely 
to be affected
• 22.5Khz or 25Khz (configurable via telnet)
PwC
AstroDrone
PwC
Effects
• Either launches the drone upwards at speed
• I now have a dented ceiling
• And a broken drone
• Or causes it to stick to the floor 
• But not crash – rotors still turn
• Liu et al (2016) – ultrasonic attacks against autonomous cars
• Lots of attacks against drones generally
• Robinson (2015)
• Son et al (2015)
• Luo (2016)
PwC
Animal repellent alarm
• PIR
• If high, sends out an ultrasonic pulse
• Adjustable frequency (0-50Khz)
• Adjustable sensitivity

Pros & Cons
• Pros
• Great for physical engagements / air-gaps
• Difficult to detect  / defend against
• Very little trace
• Cheap to design and develop
• Cons
• Usually require proximity to targeted systems
• Subject to interference
• Range and power depend on resources
PwC
Mitigations
• First step is knowing these techniques and attacks exist
• And that inputs/outputs can often be easily manipulated and 
accepted as genuine
• Where possible/feasible, block inputs/outputs to a system, or 
ensure they have a reliable failover
• Be aware of clone-and-replay attacks
• Be aware of the limitations of some security products
• e.g. fixed codes, susceptible to jamming, etc
PwC
Future research
• Exfiltration via IR 
• Acoustic keylogging
• Further work on drone repellents
• Tracking and targeting
• Identification through video 
• Combo of infrared and sound

Hopefully, you’re on the left rather than the right…
