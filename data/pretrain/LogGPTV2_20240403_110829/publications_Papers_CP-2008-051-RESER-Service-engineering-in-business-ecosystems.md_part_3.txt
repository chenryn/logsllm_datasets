### Decomposition of Enterprise Architecture into Smaller Models and Differentiation of Stakeholder Perspectives

#### Zachman Framework Overview
The Zachman Framework is a widely recognized methodology for organizing and categorizing the artifacts of an enterprise architecture. It breaks down the architecture into smaller, more manageable models, each tailored to the perspectives of specific stakeholders. The framework is structured around six interrogatives (What, How, Where, Who, When, Why) and five perspectives (Planner, Owner, Designer, Builder, User). Each cell in the matrix represents a unique model or artifact that addresses a specific aspect of the enterprise architecture.

| **Perspective** | **What** | **How** | **Where** | **Who** | **When** | **Why** |
|-----------------|----------|---------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Planner**     | List of Things | List of Business Processes | List of Locations | List of Organizations | List of Events | List of Business Goals/Strategies |
| **Owner**       | Business Model | Business Process Model | Logistics Model | Human Interface | Business Schedule | Business Plan |
| **Designer**    | Logical Data Model | System Architecture | Distributed Systems Architecture | Human Interface Architecture | Processing Structure | Business Rule Model |
| **Builder**     | Physical Data Model | Technology Design | Technology Architecture | Presentation Architecture | Control Structure | Design Rules |
| **User**        | Functioning Enterprise | Usable Data | Working Functions | Usable Network | Organized Workforce | Implemented Strategy |

### Integration of Methodologies in the ISE Framework

The ISE (Innovative Service Engineering) Framework integrates the Zachman Framework with the phases of Service Engineering (SE): requirements analysis, service design, and service implementation. These phases are mapped to Zachman’s different abstraction layers: strategic, conceptual, logical, and technical. The ISE Framework provides specific models and methods for each layer, reducing complexity by breaking down each layer into five dimensions: service description, workflow, people, data, and rules. Artifacts from each dimension can be transformed between layers, ensuring a cohesive and integrated approach.

#### Key Principles of the ISE Framework:
1. **Flexibility in Analysis**: Dimensions do not need to be analyzed and modeled in a specific order.
2. **Comprehensive Modeling**: All dimensions of one layer are combined into a complete model for the layer-specific stakeholders.
3. **Simplicity and Uniqueness**: Each abstraction layer features a simple, basic, and unique model.
4. **Clear Differentiation**: Layers are separated and clearly differentiated, with no overlapping.
5. **Iterative Transformation**: Information from artifacts is transformed iteratively between layers.

### Abstraction Layers of the ISE Framework

#### 1. Strategic Perspective
The strategic perspective focuses on identifying market and business requirements for an e-service. This involves analyzing the market, competitors, and the company's strategy and capabilities. Established business methods are used to derive semi-formal results, which are then formalized using Osterwalder’s Business Model Ontology. The main components of the business model include:

- **Service Description**: Value Proposition, Distribution Channels, Customer Relationships, and Revenue Model.
- **Workflow**: Infrastructure Management, Value Configuration, and Capabilities.
- **Data**: Immaterial Resources required for the e-service.
- **People**: Relevant Stakeholders (Target Customers, Actors, and Partners).
- **Rules**: Policies and guidelines for the e-service.

This layer is primarily for top management (CEOs, CIOs, CFOs) who make investment decisions based on the developed business models.

#### 2. Conceptual Perspective
The conceptual perspective refines the strategic artifacts and operationalizes them. Business architects and analysts work to transform the strategic vision into more detailed and operational models. The key models and their requirements include:

- **Service Description**: E-service functionality, monetary, quality, legal, and security aspects.
- **Workflow**: E-service behavior, task sequences, and capabilities.
- **People**: Organizational hierarchies, roles, and responsibilities.
- **Data**: Information necessary for tasks, using UML Class Diagrams and Entity-Relationship Diagrams.
- **Rules**: Implementation of rules and policies using SRML and SBVR.

#### 3. Logical Perspective
The logical layer bridges the gap between design and implementation by defining the abstract technical details of the e-service. The models in this layer are not executable but provide a foundation for transformation into executable models. Key models and requirements include:

- **Service Description**: Technical non-functional requirements, QoS, and e-service interface.
- **Workflow**: Graph-oriented definition of the e-service workflow using BPMN.
- **Data**: Semantic data model using OWL UML-Profile.
- **People**: Abstract representation of user interaction using Diamodl.
- **Rules**: Visual modeling of rules using F-Logic UML-Profile.

IT analysts are responsible for refining and creating the final version of the workflow, adding constructs for error handling, fault-tolerance, and transactions.

#### 4. Technical Perspective
The technical layer defines the technical specifications for the e-service, transforming the abstract models into executable or interpretable ones. Key models and requirements include:

- **Service Description**: E-service interface, operations, data types, and security aspects using WSDL and WS-standards.
- **Workflow**: Executable specification of the e-service workflow using BPEL.
- **Data**: Formal representation of e-service data artifacts using OWL.
- **People**: Specification of the user interface using CAP notation.
- **Rules**: Interpretable rules using F-Logic.

IT developers are responsible for implementing the technology and refining all other models.

### Validation – ISE Workbench
The ISE Workbench is a tool designed to support the validation and implementation of the ISE Framework. It provides a comprehensive environment for modeling, transforming, and validating the artifacts across the different abstraction layers, ensuring that the e-service meets the specified requirements and is ready for deployment.
