communication systems that use open and proprietary network
protocols can expose ADS to targeted cyber-attacks. The
possible attacks on the ADS include:
1) Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack: Many components of
the ADS are sensitive to timing and require real-time commu-
nication to ensure secure and optimal operation of system.
An attacker could Ô¨Çood a vital communication link with
fabricated packets, causing key packets to be dropped, leading
to abnormal operation of the system [20].
2) Man-in-the-Middle and Eavesdropping Attacks: The dis-
tribution system spans large geographic areas and communica-
tion lines may well be physically unprotected in places. Con-
trollers often communicate through unencrypted protocols that
can be identiÔ¨Åed and analyzed by any network analysis tool by
tapping into the cable in unguarded location. An attacker can
modify the sensor values to the controller, potentially causing
the controller to give control commands that send the system
into an unsafe state [21]. Related to this, eavesdropping attacks
may involve passive listeners of network trafÔ¨Åc that reveal
sensitive information about the status of physical devices [22].
3) Insider Attack: A person that has some combination
of authorized access of or access to a particular system, is
commonly considered an insider [23]. Not all insiders are
inherently malicious but given that they have knowledge and
access of a system that others may not have, may have
unusually large ability to damage a system, either maliciously
or accidentally. For example, insiders could compromise the
system by installing malicious software or hardware equipment
on systems not easily accessible by others.
Thus, a variety of possible attacks against conÔ¨Ådentiality,
integrity, and availability of ADS exist, with the most damag-
ing ones being those in which controllers are made to perform
actions that put the system in a physically unsafe state.
III. HYBRID CONTROL NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION
SYSTEM FOR ADS
In this section, we present our HC-NIDS solution for ADS
applications. In this paper, we focus on NIDS rules for the
FLISR system, as it is one of the widely-used applications of
ADSs, although we believe that our technique can apply to
ADSs more broadly. We Ô¨Årst describe the detailed operation
of the FLISR system, and then introduce our approach for
securing this application against cyber attacks.
A. Fault Location, Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR)
Permanent failures of any distribution system equipment,
including cables and overhead lines, would cause power outage
for electricity customers. Traditionally, distribution system op-
erators had limited monitoring and control access on distribu-
tion equipment, which made it a difÔ¨Åcult and time-consuming
process to manually locate the fault, dispatch the maintenance
crew, and Ô¨Ånally restore the service for customers.
Integration of remotely-controlled sectionalizing switches
(SSs) and fault detectors (F Ds) along with peer-to-peer
communication between the protection devices enable the
application of automatic FLISR in ADS. The FLISR function
would automatically detect feeder faults, determine the fault
location, isolate the faulted section of the feeder, and restore
service to healthy portions of the feeder [18]. This automation
of the process would considerably reduce the customers‚Äô
outage duration and improve the reliability of the distribution
system [3]. The typical radial distribution feeder, shown in
Fig. 1, is used to exemplify the FLISR process. The feeder
consists of four lines sections (Li) which are equipped at both
sides with SSs and F Ds. The main feeder energizes the four
load points (LPi) through a circuit breaker (CB). Consider a
permanent fault that occurs on line section L3 in Fig. 1. The
FLISR process operates as follows:
1. Fault Location: The CB of the main feeder detects the
fault, operates and de-energizes all the four downstream
load points.
2. Fault Isolation: Fault detectors F D4 and F D5 report the
location of the fault to the master station. Accordingly,
an opening command is sent by the master station

to sectionalizing switches SS4 and SS5 to isolate the
faulted section.
3. Service Restoration: The master station sends a closing
command to the feeder CB; therefore load points LP1
and LP2 are re-energized.

B. Hybrid Control NIDS (HC-NIDS)
Our ‚Äúhybrid control‚Äù use of NIDS is designed to perform
real-time monitoring and analysis of network trafÔ¨Åc and detect
actions that do not conform to a set of predeÔ¨Åned operational
rules and policies. We leverage the Bro Network Monitoring
Framework [17], but our technique could be implemented in
other IDS frameworks as well. We assume that the Modbus
TCP protocol is utilized as the communication protocol be-
tween the controllers in FLISR, although our approach applies
equally well to other protocols such as DNP3, and indeed the
Bro IDS that we use also contains a DNP3 parser, in addition
to a Modbus parser.
We use Bro to monitor the network trafÔ¨Åc of the FLISR
system, and is responsible for identifying any actions that are
not consistent with the physical operation and network com-
munication rules of the Hybrid Control scheme that describes
FLISR‚Äôs legitimate operation during faults. For this reason, as
described earlier, we refer to our approach as Hybrid Control
NIDS (HC-NIDS). The Ô¨Årst layer of the HC-NIDS is an event
engine which captures the network trafÔ¨Åc, detects every single
Modbus packet and forwards the packets to analyze within the
second layer which is the rules layer. We deÔ¨Åne the following
intrusion detection rules which reÔ¨Çect the communication rules
and speciÔ¨Åc operation procedure of the FLISR:
1. IP Address: Any request packet that has an IP address
different than the FLISR master‚Äôs IP address indicates
an attempt of attack.
2. Valid Command: Only commands to write in single
controller input (function code=5) are allowed. The write
commands intend to open/close CBs and SSs. Packets
that include any other commands are not acceptable.
3. FLISR Operation Procedure: The communication pattern
in Fig. 2 shows the valid communication procedure
between the controllers in FLISR system. Any deviation
from the pattern in Fig. 2 may reÔ¨Çect an attack.
4. Operation Cycle Duration: The time gap between two
‚Äúwrite‚Äù commands speciÔ¨Åed in the expected packet
sequence (one operation cycle) has a relatively constant
value. SigniÔ¨Åcant deviations from the average cycle
duration suggest a possible attack.
5. Circuit conservation laws: The voltages, currents, and
Ô¨Çows of power in the FLISR circuit should be consistent
with the circuit conservation laws, i.e., current, voltage
and power balance, before and after the control action.
Inconsistencies in the conservation laws, considering the
tolerance margins, may be the results of a false action.
The novelty of our intrusion detection rules is that they
focus speciÔ¨Åcally on well-deÔ¨Åned operational procedures and
the way in which commands are sent via the network to
manipulate the FLISR system, rather than focusing solely on
malformed packets or other types of network packets that are
harmful but agnostic to the operations of the system under
control. The captured packets are analyzed to check their
consistency to the rules. If a packet contains a command that
would trigger a deviation from the normal behavior of FLISR
as reÔ¨Çected by the intrusion detection rules, a log entry or alert
is triggered.

IV. CASE STUDIES USING OUR APPROACH
In order to demonstrate the utility of our approach in
protecting cyber vulnerabilities of the FLISR system, we
implemented different attack scenarios whose main purpose is
to either confound the system or retrieve important information
about the system‚Äôs state. Our primary goal in describing this
assessment is to demonstrate that by leveraging knowledge
of the system‚Äôs expected behavior, our approach can observe
a broad range of potential classes of intrusions, in addition
to the typical
intrusion detection rules that many existing
NIDS employ. Attack scenarios in subsection A show cases
where a traditional NIDS works well by checking that the
information in network layer are not violated. The rest of the
attack scenarios demonstrate capabilities largely speciÔ¨Åc to the
approach used in the HC-NIDS.
The experimental set-up of our implementation, as shown in
Fig. 3, consists of physical devices, PLCs, and the HC-NIDS.
We used two Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 series PLCs, model
CPU 1212C AC/DC/RLY, that are conÔ¨Ågured to emulate the
FLISR system‚Äôs tasks and communicate through the Modbus

TCP protocol. The master controller emulates the FLISR mas-
ter station and receives as input data the status of the F Ds, that
are implemented by digital switches. The slave controller in
Fig. 3 emulates the actions of circuit breaker and sectionalizing
switches. In order to perform the FLISR functions, the slave
controller receives queries from the master controller to enable
or disable the circuit breaker and sectionalizing switches.
The control algorithm of the FLISR is programmed on both
controllers using the ladder logic programming language on
the SIMATIC STEP 7 Basic software.
