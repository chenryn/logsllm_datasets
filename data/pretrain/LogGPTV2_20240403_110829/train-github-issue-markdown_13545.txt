The type definitions are causing TS2300/Duplicate identifier errors due to
collision with ES6. Exact output is:
    514     bold(): string;
            ~~~~
    node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es6.d.ts(514,5): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'bold'.
    109     bold: string;
            ~~~~
    typings/globals/colors/index.d.ts(109,5): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'bold'.
It appears that the tscparams file for this is preventing the error from
appearing in the unit tests. According to the package's documentation, using
the 'colors/safe' module would not override the string classes native methods
and would do away with this error. But, as the definitions do not have this
sub module, Typescript does not allow the import of 'colors/safe'.
