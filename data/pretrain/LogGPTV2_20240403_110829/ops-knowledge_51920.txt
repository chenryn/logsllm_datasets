User: Or any other normal scripting language for that matter. I know there is VBScript and JScript. But I don't really like those for any kind of computing.
I would really love to have python or ruby (or perl) interpreter installed with windows by default so when I write small console applications I wouldn't need to distribute whole python installation with it via py2exe(or similar).
Do you know if there is such incentive? Do you think this would be possible? Or it's not acceptable for Microsoft?
Assistant: Microsoft makes it pretty obvious they want you to use their version of everything.  So what is in it for them to have Python or any other language as part of their Windows operating system?    
They want you to program for Microsoft Internet Explorer using Microsoft Active Server Pages with Microsoft Visual Basic on Microsoft Internet Information Server, back-ended by Microsoft SQL Server running on top of Microsoft Windows.  It goes on and on like this...
It makes perfect sense from a business perspective when you think about it.
So... Will we see competing "products"--even open source ones--installed by default on Windows?  Not gonna happen anytime soon.
