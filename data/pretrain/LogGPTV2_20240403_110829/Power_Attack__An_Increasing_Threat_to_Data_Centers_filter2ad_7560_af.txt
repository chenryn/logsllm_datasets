### Power Capping and Its Limitations

Power capping can mitigate power attacks to some extent, but it cannot completely prevent them. A control period of 2 minutes for power to return after a power spike is significant, allowing an attacker to launch multiple attacks within this interval. The three main reasons for the limitations of power capping are:

1. **Long Control Period**: A 2-minute interval between power spikes is long enough for an attacker to initiate multiple attacks.
2. **Inadequate Prevention**: Power capping is designed primarily to allow more aggressive power oversubscription in data centers, which can actually increase the risk of power attacks.
3. **No Attack at Valley is Successful**: Attacks during low-power periods (valleys) are not as effective, but they can still contribute to overall system instability.

In summary, while power capping can mitigate power attacks, it cannot fully prevent them due to the long control period and the primary design goal of enabling power oversubscription.

### Server Consolidation and Energy Proportionality

Servers often consume a significant amount of power even when idling. Recent studies show that current servers draw about 60% of their peak power at idle, far from the ideal of energy proportionality, where a server's energy consumption would be proportional to its workload. An energy-proportional server would consume minimal energy at idle and increase its energy consumption proportionally with workload intensity. Given that the average server utilization in typical data centers is only 20-30%, energy-proportional servers could lead to substantial energy savings.

**Server Consolidation:**
A recent power management strategy, server consolidation, involves dynamically migrating and consolidating workloads onto a smaller number of servers and shutting down others to save energy. For example, several studies have proposed VM placement solutions that use live VM migration for server consolidation. While these solutions reduce overall energy consumption, they may also increase the risk of power attacks. 

**Risks of Server Consolidation:**
- **High Utilization and Power Consumption**: Consolidated workloads on fewer servers typically result in high utilization and, consequently, high power consumption per server.
- **Rack and PDU Overload**: Consolidated workloads are often placed on servers in the same rack or connected to the same PDU for easier management, leading to higher power consumption in specific areas. This can push these areas closer to the edge of a power outage, providing an attacker with better opportunities to launch power attacks.

### Future Implications of Energy Proportionality

Future server hardware will likely become more energy proportional, but this can also provide more opportunities for power attackers. Energy proportionality allows for more aggressive power oversubscription, increasing the likelihood of power outages. For instance, a non-energy-proportional server with a peak power of 200 W consumes 160 W at 20% utilization, allowing a rack with a 2000 W rated power limit to host 12 such servers. In contrast, an energy-proportional server consuming 40 W at 20% utilization could allow the same rack to host up to 50 servers. An attacker could then easily increase the power consumption to 4000 W by raising the server utilization to 40%, causing a significant overload and tripping the circuit breaker.

### Mitigation Methods

Defending against power attacks is challenging due to three main factors:

1. **Power Oversubscription**: Although power oversubscription reduces operational costs, it exposes data centers to power attacks. As data centers scale up, power oversubscription becomes more aggressive to accommodate more servers.
2. **Power Monitoring**: Accurately monitoring power consumption in large-scale data centers is difficult and costly. Current solutions approximate power consumption via utilization-based modeling, which is imprecise.
3. **Cloud Services**: With easy access to cloud services, attackers can consume computing resources like normal users, making it difficult to distinguish and deny their service requests.

Despite these challenges, feasible approaches exist to mitigate power attacks:

- **Fine-Grained Power Tracking**: Estimating the power consumption of individual incoming requests and taking corresponding actions can help defend against power attacks at the server level. Shen et al. [31] built models to estimate power consumption throughout the execution life of requests, effectively throttling high-consumption request rates and suppressing power spikes.
- **Power Balancing**: At the cluster and data center levels, a new load balancing strategy called power balancing uses estimated power consumption to distribute incoming service requests. This approach minimizes the chance of tripping a branch circuit breaker by evenly distributing high-power requests across different branch circuits.
- **Per-Server UPS**: Deploying a mini-UPS for each server can protect against short power outages. However, replacing data-center-level UPS with tens of thousands of mini-UPSes is a complex task that requires time and careful planning.

### Related Work

While we are the first to propose the concept of power attack, numerous studies have focused on power management in various computing environments:

- **Data Center Power Management**: Studies have aimed to save energy by adjusting workload distribution algorithms and reducing power consumption of individual servers. Despite these efforts, data centers still face high power provisioning pressure and rely on power oversubscription.
- **Power Consumption and Circuit Breakers**: Fu et al. [13] demonstrated the relationship between power consumption and the time to trip a circuit breaker, providing theoretical support for more aggressive power oversubscription.
- **HPC Benchmarks**: Kamil et al. [16] analyzed the power consumption patterns of different HPC benchmarks, supporting the argument that different workloads lead to varied power consumption patterns.
- **Server Consolidation and Power Consumption**: Previous studies on server consolidation have focused on the power and energy savings before and after VM migration. Our work highlights the additional power consumption during migration, which can be exploited by malicious attackers.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of power oversubscription in data centers and introduce the concept of power attack. We explore different attack vectors in PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS environments, demonstrating that a power attack can significantly increase power consumption and trip circuit breakers. Our experimental results show that a power attack can increase power consumption by over 30% in different environments and can bring down a PDU or an entire data center. We discuss the impact of various power management schemes on power security and propose effective defenses to mitigate power attacks.

### Future Work

We will further explore more efficient and stealthy power attack vectors in different data center environments and systematically study defense techniques, develop prototypes, and conduct experiments to evaluate their effectiveness in real scenarios.
