**Abstract:**
Home appliance manufacturers aim to gather user feedback to enhance their products and services, thereby building a smart home system. To assist these manufacturers, we propose a federated learning (FL) system that incorporates a reputation mechanism. This system enables manufacturers to train machine learning models based on customer data, allowing them to predict future customer requirements and consumption behaviors. The system's workflow consists of two stages:

1. **Initial Model Training:**
   - Customers use their mobile phones and mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to train the initial model provided by the manufacturer.
   - Data from various home appliances are collected via mobile phones, and the initial model is downloaded and trained using local data.
   - After training, customers sign their local models and send them to the blockchain. The blockchain ensures that records are tamper-proof, making malicious activities traceable.

2. **Model Aggregation:**
   - Manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners to calculate the averaged model from the received local models.
   - One miner, chosen as the temporary leader, uploads the final global model to the blockchain.

To protect customer privacy and improve test accuracy, we apply differential privacy to the extracted features and introduce a new normalization technique. Experimental results show that our normalization technique outperforms batch normalization under differential privacy. Additionally, we design an incentive mechanism to encourage more customers to participate in the crowdsourcing FL task.

**I. Introduction**

Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart home systems have gained significant popularity in recent years, aiming to enhance the quality of life. According to a report by Statista [1], the global smart home market size is expected to reach $53.3 billion by 2022. These systems are powered by advanced technologies such as IoT devices, smartphones, wireless communications, cloud and edge computing, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies enable manufacturers to maintain seamless connections among smart home appliances, generating vast amounts of data.

Federated learning (FL) allows analysts to utilize locally generated data in a decentralized manner without uploading it to a centralized server, thus preserving data utility and privacy. To help home appliance manufacturers leverage this data, we designed an FL-based system. Our system considers home appliances of the same brand in a family as a unit, with a mobile phone collecting data periodically and training the machine learning model locally [2]. Given the limited computational power and battery life of mobile phones, part of the training task is offloaded to the MEC server. The blockchain smart contract then aggregates the locally trained models to generate a global model.

However, Melis et al. [3] demonstrated that gradient updates can leak significant information about customers' training data, and attackers can recover data from uploaded gradients [4]. Additionally, the federated approach is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks [5], and there are information leakage risks in third-party MEC servers [6]. To address these security and privacy issues, we adopt blockchain and differential privacy. Apple successfully applies differential privacy in FL to enhance the privacy of its voice assistant service Siri [7].

In our system, manufacturers upload an initial model with initialized parameters, which customers download and train with their local data. The blockchain helps the crowdsourcing requester (manufacturer) audit for malicious updates, reducing costly service fees. For large models, we propose using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) [8] as a distributed storage solution.

**Contributions:**
1. We propose a hierarchical crowdsourcing FL system to help home appliance manufacturers improve their service quality and optimize appliance functionalities.
2. We introduce a new normalization technique that outperforms batch normalization in test accuracy while preserving the privacy of extracted features. Differential privacy is used to prevent adversaries from inferring sensitive information.
3. Our blockchain-based system ensures accountability for all model updates, preventing malicious updates.

- Section III presents related work.
- Section IV introduces our system design.
- Section V discusses the advantages and disadvantages of our system.
- Section VI presents experimental results.
- Section VII discusses how we prevent information leakage using differential privacy.
