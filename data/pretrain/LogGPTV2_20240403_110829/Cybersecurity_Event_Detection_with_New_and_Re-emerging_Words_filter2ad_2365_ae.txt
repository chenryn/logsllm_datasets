### Case Studies

#### Lokibot Detection
On April 2, 2019, W2E detected an event related to Lokibot, where some tweets contained download URLs for the malware. One of the URLs, `bluewales.ml/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Panel/five/fre.php`, was flagged as malicious by VirusTotal on April 4, 2019. This case demonstrates W2E's capability to collect recent indicators of compromise (IOCs) and detect threats before they are widely recognized.

#### Drupal (CVE-2018-7602)
W2E detected a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Drupal, an open-source content management framework, on April 25, 2018. The detection was made using the keywords "drupal" and "cve-2018-7602." The Drupal Security Team strongly recommended immediate updates due to the high severity (CVSS score of 9.8). This case highlights the importance of early detection and prompt mitigation of vulnerabilities.

#### Firebase (Data Breach)
Firebase, a Backend-as-a-Service from Google, experienced a data breach where thousands of iOS and Android apps leaked sensitive user data due to misconfigured backends. W2E detected this issue on June 20, 2018, with the keywords "firebase," "android," and "database." Despite only two tweets mentioning "firebase" on the day of detection, W2E's re-emerging words detection algorithm successfully identified the threat, providing an early alert.

#### Marvell Avanstar (WiFi Firmware Bug)
A WiFi firmware bug in the Marvell Avanstar chip was publicly disclosed on January 18, 2019. W2E's early detection capabilities allowed for timely alerts, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in identifying and reporting emerging security issues.
