User: I've tried many variations of this command: idle.py -e filepath, but it simply starts IDLE like normal, not opening any extra windows for editing, and not throwing any errors.
So how can I do the equivalent of opening IDLE, file>open>filepath via the command line (or perhaps even a Python module)?
Assistant: Just add IDLE's path to your PATH environment variable.
For example I created an environment variable called IDLE_PATH and set the value to C:\Python27\Lib\idlelib
Then in my PATH variable I added ;%IDLE_PATH%; and open a new cmd prompt or in console2 just open a new tab and run idle <file_name> to open the file, you will be able to do this from any directory. In IPython console add an ! before the command, for example !idle test.py.
Congrates, Now you're a python pimp!
