I am impressed with Django. Currently, I am a Java developer, and I would like to create some cool websites for personal use. However, I want to host these sites in a third-party environment. 

My question is: Can I host a Django application on Google App Engine? If so, how can I do that? Are there any existing websites built with Django that are already hosted on App Engine?

**Answer:**

Google App Engine does support Django, and you can find a few versions of Django in the `google_appengine/lib/django_1_3` directory. You can specify which version of Django you want to use in your `app.yaml` file.

However, it's important to note that the built-in Django version provided by App Engine is not a full release. If you need the full admin functionality of Django, you might have to use an alternative like `django-nonrel`. Nevertheless, I would recommend exploring the NoSQL data structures provided by App Engine, particularly the NDB model, as it offers powerful and efficient data handling capabilities. This approach will help you better understand and leverage the underlying infrastructure of App Engine.

To get started, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK.
   - Set up a new project in the Google Cloud Console.
   - Clone or create your Django application.

2. **Configure `app.yaml`:**
   - Define the runtime and entry point for your application.
   - Specify the Django version if needed.

3. **Adapt Your Application:**
   - Modify your Django models to use the NDB model or another compatible NoSQL solution.
   - Adjust settings and configurations to work with App Engine.

4. **Deploy Your Application:**
   - Use the `gcloud` command-line tool to deploy your application to App Engine.
   - Test your application in the App Engine environment.

By following these steps, you can successfully host your Django application on Google App Engine and take advantage of its robust and scalable infrastructure.
