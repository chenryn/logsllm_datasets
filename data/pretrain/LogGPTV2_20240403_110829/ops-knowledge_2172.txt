User: I am impressed with django.Am am currenty a java developer.I want to make some cool websites for myself but i want to host it in some third pary environmet.
Now the question is can i host the django application on appengine?If yes , how??
Are there any site built using django which are already hosted on appengine?
Assistant: Appengine comes with built in Django, if you look under your (google_appengine/lib/django_1_3) lib dir you will see a few versions. You can define what version you want to be used in your app.yaml 
It isn't a full release of Django and if you do want to have full admin functionality of Django you might have to use something like nonrel but personally I would say its not necessary and you stand to gain more by getting to understand the underlying nosql structure of appengine, in particular the NDB model is very useful
