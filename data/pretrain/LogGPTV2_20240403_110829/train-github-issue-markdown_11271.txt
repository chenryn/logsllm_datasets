  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
This issue is similar to #8963, to which I added a comment. If children are
added to a drawer where `persistent=true`, the component will spill onto the
page.
The component position should update automatically in order to stay hidden or
provide the caller with the information needed to resize the component.
@oliviertassinari said: "The resolution should be about adding an action
property to the Slider so people can programmatically update the position."
## Current Behavior
Currently the drawer content spills onto the page when children are added
while the drawer is closed.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
See a demo here:

## Context
I'm using a bottom anchored persistent drawer for a list of file uploads. The
drawer content has a `max-height`, but the exact height isn't specified. I
want the drawer to be the right height to only be as large as needed to cover
the list of uploaded files. Currently, as completed uploads are added to the
list, if the drawer is closed, the content will spill onto the page until the
drawer is opened and then closed again.
