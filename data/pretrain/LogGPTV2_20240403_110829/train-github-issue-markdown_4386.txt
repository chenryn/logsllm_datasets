I have a package of reusable components that use styled-jsx that I import into
my Next.js app (version 2.4.0).
The styles of the components in the package do not get rendered on the server
and results in a flash of unstyled content on page load.
Is there an approach that's taken for cases like this?
My only hack has been to import the styled-jsx files separately into my app
and add the style to the render using `` but that
results in duplicate styles when the component's styles get attributed by the
client.
Any help would be greatly appreciated
