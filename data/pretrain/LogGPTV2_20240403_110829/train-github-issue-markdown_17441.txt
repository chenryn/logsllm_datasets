# Feature request
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
By default next.js automatically routes /api/file, we need a way to access the
api through relative path. It is currently forbidden in next.js probably due
to the need to support SSR, though it should be possible to supply the address
where api could be accessed from the req header.
## Describe the solution you'd like
add something like appAddress in context parameter of getInitialProps
## Describe alternatives you've considered
.env or other configuration setting to customize, though it creates overhead
for a usual use-case.
