**Recovering Lost/Overwritten Data in MSSQL 2008 Table**

I am in urgent need of professional advice regarding the recovery of lost or overwritten data in our MSSQL 2008 table. We are currently facing a critical issue due to a human error, and I am seeking guidance on how to proceed.

### Situation Overview

- **Database Version**: MSSQL Server 2008
- **Issue**: We removed the primary key and replaced existing data with new data, resulting in the loss of critical business data in the child tables.
- **Context**: This was a human error, and there was no disk failure.

### Current Status

1. **Last Backup**: The most recent backup file is from a month ago, making it impractical for recovery.
2. **Daily Backups**: We had set up a Maintenance Plan to back up the database at 12 AM every day, but these backup files are nowhere to be found.
3. **Transaction Logs**: A colleague suggested that we might be able to recover data from the transaction logs. However, when I attempt to restore from the transaction log via `Task > Restore`, the option is grayed out and unavailable.
4. **Maintenance Plans**: Upon checking `Management > Maintenance Plans`, I could not find any restore points, indicating that our maintenance plan may not have been functioning correctly.

### Questions

1. Is it possible to recover lost or overwritten data from the MSSQL table using third-party tools?
2. Are there any other methods or steps we can take to recover the data?

### Potential Solutions

If your database is in full recovery mode and the transaction chain is intact (i.e., you have a full backup plus all subsequent transaction logs), it may be possible to recover some or all of the data by analyzing the transaction logs.

#### Steps to Consider

1. **Check Recovery Mode**: Ensure that your database is in full recovery mode. If it is, transactions are logged and can be read from the transaction log.
2. **Use DBCC LOG Command**: You can try to read the transaction log yourself using the `DBCC LOG` command. This is a complex task and requires a good understanding of SQL Server internals.
3. **Third-Party Tools**: Consider using third-party tools such as ApexSQL Log or Quest Toad. These tools can help in parsing and recovering data from transaction logs.

### Conclusion

We are in a serious situation and need immediate assistance. Any advice or recommendations on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.
