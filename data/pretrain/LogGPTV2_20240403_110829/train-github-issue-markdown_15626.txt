https://github.com/diginikkari/webkit-issue
**Test file (self-contained)**
    test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto('http://127.0.0.1:5173/');
        // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
        await page.frameLocator('#wallsio-iframe').getByText('j4z3r').click();
    });
**Steps**
  * [Run the test]
  * [...]
**Expected**
Test should pass.
**Actual**
Test is failing in webkit when runned in github actions with **ubuntu-latest**
-runner. In trace it is showing: `Failed to load resource: Unacceptable TLS
certificate` error.
Tests are working fine in MacOs. Tests are also working when using Docker
image: `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.32.0-focal`. This could be related to
#15410.
