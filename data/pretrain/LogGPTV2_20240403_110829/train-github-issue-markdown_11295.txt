## Expected Behavior
Use new Next.js plugin for TypeScript
## Current Behavior
Use a hack to transpile TypeScript to JSX and then let Next.js handle it.
## Context
With the release of Next.js v5 the current example with TypeScript is outdated
and can be simplified with the new next-typescript plugin.
