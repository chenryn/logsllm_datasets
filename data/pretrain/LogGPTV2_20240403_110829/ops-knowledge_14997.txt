Assistant: System bottlenecks may be high CPU and memory usage on the server. The possible reasons are as follows: 1. There are some time-consuming operations that need to occupy more CPU resources, resulting in high CPU usage. 2. The system load is too high, resulting in high CPU and memory usage. 3. System memory leaks, resulting in increasing memory usage. The optimization scheme is as follows: 1. Optimize the code to reduce the CPU usage. For example, avoid code that causes high CPU usage, such as infinite loops or recursion. 2. For the problem of excessive system load, consider increasing the number of servers and distributing the load to multiple servers. 3. For the problem of memory leaks, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive memory inspection and tuning of the system. For example, check whether there is a memory leak in the code, and properly handle the creation and destruction of objects, etc. You can also consider using some memory detection tools, such as Valgrind, etc., to find memory leaks and other memory problems.
