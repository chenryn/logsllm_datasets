We can then establish our bounds on the initial uncertainty
as follows.
then her belief and her observation are incompatible. Let o and
b be the adversary’s observation and initial belief respectively.
She will then only try values a in Γb for which pρ(o | a) > 0 if
her belief and observation are compatible. Otherwise, as the
evidence contradicts her belief, she will throw it away and
only use the observation.
Now let Γb,o denote the set possible adversary’s choices
according to both her belief and her low observation. Then
Γb,o = ( argmaxa∈A pβ(a | b, o)
argmaxa∈A pρ(a | o)
if b ⋄ o,
otherwise.
Then we deﬁne the a posteriori belief-vulnerability as follows.
Deﬁnition 7: Let A be the high input of a program, O its
low output and B the adversary’s initial belief about A. Then
the belief-vulnerability of A given O, denoted V(A | O : B), is
deﬁned as
Theorem 1: Let A be a random variable and B be the
additional information about A. Then
V(A | O : B) = Xo∈OXb∈B
pρ(b, o)V(A | o : b),
(12)
H∞(A | B) ≤ H∞(A : B) ≤ H∞(A | B) + log(cid:16) 1
ζ(cid:17),
|Γb| Pa∈Γb pρ(a | b)(cid:1)/V(A | b).
where ζ = minb∈B(cid:0) 1
Note that ζ in the above theorem is strictly greater than
zero since we consider admissible beliefs for some positive ǫ.
Hence the upper bound is well deﬁned.
Proof: From Lemma 10, Lemma 2, Lemma 3 and
Lemma 4 we have
H∞(A | B) ≤ H∞(A : B).
The second part of the inequality follows from Lemma 6 and
from the fact that the adversary’s belief is ζ-accurate.
Finally, we show that when A is uniformly distributed, we
can obtain a better upper bound. We begin by recalling a result
proven in [35].
Lemma 7: If A is uniformly distributed and the program is
deterministic then H∞(A | O) = log(cid:0) |A| / |O|(cid:1).
Thus we have the following corollary of Theorem 1.
Corollary 1: If A is uniformly distributed and the actual
correlation pρ(b | a) is deterministic then
log(cid:16) |A|
|B| (cid:17) ≤ H∞(A : B) ≤ log(cid:16) |A|
|B| (cid:17) + log(cid:16) 1
ζ(cid:17),
where ζ is deﬁned as in the above theorem.
B. A posteriori belief-vulnerability
We now deﬁne our belief-vulnerability conditioned to the
low observations of the adversary. Note that in this case, the
adversary’s low observations could help her sort out inaccurate
beliefs. Indeed, if an observation o contradicts her initial belief
about extra information b, that is there is no high input a in Γb
such that pρ(o | a) > 0, then to try values in Γb is pointless. A
belief b is compatible (from the adversary’s point of view) to
an observation o, denoted b⋄o, if there exists a in Γb such that
pρ(o | a) > 0. For instance, if the adversary initially believes
that A is an odd number while observing a low output o of the
program which is only possible for even numbers high inputs,
where V(A | o : b) = 1
|Γb,o| Pa∈Γb,o pρ(a | o, b).
We now show how to compute V(A | O : B) under the
assumption that the extra information B and the low observable
O are actually independent.
V(A | O : B) = Xo∈O
pρ(b, o)V(A | o : b)
|Γb,o| Xa∈Γb,o
pρ(a | o, b)(cid:17)
pρ(a | o, b)pρ(b, o)
= Xo∈OXb∈B

|Γb,o| Xa∈Γb,o

pρ(o, b | a)pρ(a)
pρ(b | a)pρ(o | a)pρ(a)
Thus we have the following proposition.
Proposition 3: Let A be the high input of a program, O its
low output and B the adversary’s extra information about A.
If O and B are independent, then
V(A | O : B) = Xo∈OXb∈B
1
|Γb,o| Xa∈Γb,o
pρ(b | a)pρ(o | a)pρ(a).
We then deﬁne our remaining uncertainty as follows.
Deﬁnition 8: Let A be the high input of a program, O
its low output and B the adversary’s initial belief about A.
The remaining uncertainty about A after observing O, denoted
H∞(A | O : B), is deﬁned as
H∞(A | O : B) = log(cid:16)
1
V(A | O : B) (cid:17)
Example 4: Consider the following program, with A and B
as in Example 3, then O = {0, 1, 2}.
PROG C5:
BEGIN
O := ⌊ log(A + 1) ⌋;
END
Both the program and the adversary’s assumed correlation
are deterministic, it is therefore easy to compute the adver-
sary’s belief conditional matrix pβ(a | o, b) and the associated
possible choices Γo,b. The result is shown in Table III. Thus
under the assumption that B and O are actually independent
we have
pρ(b | a)pρ(o | a)pρ(a)
pρ(b | a)pρ(o | a)

Hence V(A | O : B) ≥ 1
2 , meaning that the remaining uncer-
tainty H∞(A | O : B) is always less than or equal to 1 regardless
the actual correlation between A and B. Thus PROG C5 leaves
the high value very vulnerable to be guessed. Recall that the
initial uncertainty H∞(A : B) (see Example 3) can be arbitrary
high when the accuracy of the adversary’s belief is very low.
This implies that a deliberate reverting of the parity of the
high value in order to confuse the adversary is of very little
use when the adversary can see the output of PROG C5. Indeed,
even if her initial belief is wrong, the observation allows her
to correct it. Table IV summarises the remaining uncertainty
for PROG C5 when the actual correlation is ρ1, ρ2 and ρ3.
We now establish both a lower bound and upper bound
to our remaining uncertainty. To this end, we establish some
auxiliary results.
We ﬁrst extend the notion of initial belief’s accuracy and
the partial order ≪ to the adversary’s post-beliefs as follows.
An adversary’s post-belief is (at least) ω-accurate if
∀o ∈ O, ∀b ∈ B,
1
|Γb,o| Xa∈Γb,o
pρ(a | o, b) ≥ ω · V(A | o, b).
Let ≪O denote the partial order on Beliefs induced by the ob-
servations O such that (cid:0) pβ(a), pβ(b | a)(cid:1) ≪O (cid:0) p′

As in the previous subsection, we can show that a 1-accurate
post-belief is an information and that the remaining uncertainty
is a decreasing function of the accuracy of the adversary post-
belief.
Lemma 8: Let A be the high input of a program, O its
low output and B be an additional information about A. If the
adversary’s post-belief is 1-accurate then
H∞(A | O : B) = H∞(A | B, O).
Lemma 9: (cid:0) pβ(a), pβ(b | a)(cid:1) ≪O (cid:0) p′
H∞(A | O : B) ≥ H∞(A | O : B′).
β(a), p′
β(b | a)(cid:1) implies
We then establish the following bounds for the belief-
vulnerability based remaining uncertainty.
Theorem 2: Let A be a random variable, B be the additional
information about A and O be the low output of the program.
Then
H∞(A | O, B) ≤ H∞(A|O : B) ≤ H∞(A | O, B) + log(cid:16) 1
η(cid:17),
|Γo,b| Pa∈Γo,b pρ(a | o, )(cid:17) / V(A | o, b).
where η = mino∈O, b∈B(cid:16)
1
Finally we have the following corollary of Theorem 2.
Corollary 2: If A is uniformly distributed and both the
protocol and the actual correlation between A and B are
deterministic then
log(cid:16)
|A|
|O| · |B|(cid:17) ≤ H∞(A | O : B) ≤ log(cid:16)
|A|
|O| · |B|(cid:17) + log(cid:16) 1
η(cid:17).
We conclude this section by showing that in case of belief’s
absence (i.e., the initial knowledge of the adversary is reduce
to trivial information) then our deﬁnitions are equivalent to
the vulnerability-based deﬁnitions of Smith.

Correlation matrices
We denote by IUx the initial uncertainty computed using
approach x ∈ {c, v, bv} where c, v and bv denote the consensus,
vulnerability and belief-vulnerability approaches respectively.
Ditto for RUx and ILx.
We begin by PROG C1 of Example 1. Since A is uniformly
distributed then IUc = IUv = log |A| = 2. Furthermore,
= 1 = RUc since PROG C1
is deterministic. Thus, when we do not take into account
the attacker’s belief, then ILc = ILv = 1. Now let consider
the uniformly ω-accurate attacker’s belief. Then from the
RUv = log(cid:0)|A| / |O|(cid:1) = log 4
