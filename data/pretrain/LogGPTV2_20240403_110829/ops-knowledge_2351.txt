User: Please introduce the CAP theory and BASE theory in distributed systems respectively.
Assistant: CAP theory: CAP theory is an important theory in distributed systems. Its core concept is: in distributed systems, consistency (Consistency), availability (Availability), and partition tolerance (Partition Tolerance) can only satisfy two requirements at the same time. , it is impossible to satisfy all three at the same time. Consistency refers to the fact that all data copies of a distributed system should be consistent at the same point in time. Availability refers to the ability of the system to provide external services at any time. Partition fault tolerance means that there may be network partitions among the nodes in the distributed system. The partitioned nodes cannot communicate with each other, but after the partition is over, the system should be able to return to normal. In the CAP theory, each system must choose a trade-off between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Different choices of the system will produce different effects. BASE theory: BASE theory is a supplement and a strict expansion of the traditional ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, persistence) transaction processing model. BASE is proposed based on the summary of the practice of large-scale distributed systems. Its core idea is: in order to achieve scalability, we need to give up strong consistency, but adopt a basically usable, soft state, and eventual consistency approach. Basic availability means that the distributed system can guarantee the normal use of core functions in the face of large concurrent access or partial component failure. Soft state refers to allowing the data in the system to exist in an intermediate state, and this intermediate state will not affect the overall effectiveness of the system. Final consistency means that after a period of time, the data in the distributed system can finally reach a consistent state. In short, the BASE theory is a theory produced to solve problems such as high availability, high performance, and high scalability. Unlike the ACID principle, which tolerates inconsistent states, BASE improves system flexibility and scalability by using a more flexible model on large-scale distributed systems.
