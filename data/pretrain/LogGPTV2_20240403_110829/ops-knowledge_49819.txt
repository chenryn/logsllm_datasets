I understand that you have two `.pyo` files, `config.pyo` and `model.pyo`, and you want to modify them. Here is a more structured and professional way to present your request and the solution:

---

**Problem Description:**

I have two Python-optimized bytecode files, `config.pyo` and `model.pyo`, which I need to modify. I have attempted to decompile these files using `decompyle`, but the decompiled source code is not perfect, as indicated by the verification process.

**Specific Modifications:**

1. **`config.pyo`**:
   - The decompiled source code contains an array of user IDs:
     ```python
     ADMIN_USERIDS = [116901, 141, 349244, 39, 1159488]
     ```
   - I would like to change one of these IDs.

2. **`model.pyo`**:
   - The decompiled source code contains a conditional statement:
     ```python
     if (productsDeveloperId != self.getUserId()):
     ```
   - I would like to change the `!=` operator to `==`.

**Current Approach:**

- I am considering disassembling or hex-editing the `.pyo` files to make these changes.
- I have tried using `decompyle` for decompilation, but the results are not perfect.
- I am new to reading Python bytecode and am looking for a reliable method to achieve these modifications.

**Questions:**

1. How can I disassemble or modify the `.pyo` files to change the specific values?
2 - Are there any Python disassemblers or tools that can help with this task?

**Additional Information:**

- I am aware that IDA Pro up to version 6.0 does not have a `.pyc` decompilation module.

**Suggested Solutions:**

1. **Using `uncompyle6` or `decompyle3`**:
   - These are more recent and robust decompilers for Python bytecode. You can try using them to get a better decompiled version of your `.pyo` files.
   - Install `uncompyle6` using pip:
     ```sh
     pip install uncompyle6
     ```
   - Decompile the `.pyo` files:
     ```sh
     uncompyle6 config.pyo > config.py
     uncompyle6 model.pyo > model.py
     ```

2. **Manual Bytecode Editing**:
   - If the decompiled source is still not perfect, you may need to edit the bytecode directly.
   - Use a Python disassembler like `dis` to inspect the bytecode:
     ```python
     import dis
     with open('config.pyo', 'rb') as f:
         dis.dis(f.read())
     ```
   - Identify the bytecode instructions corresponding to the values you want to change.
   - Use a hex editor to modify the bytecode directly. Be cautious with this approach as it requires a good understanding of Python bytecode.

3. **Alternative Tools**:
   - Consider using `pycdc` or `retdec` for decompilation, which might provide better results.
   - For more advanced analysis, you can use `ghidra` or `radare2`, which support Python bytecode and offer powerful disassembly and decompilation features.

By following these steps, you should be able to make the necessary modifications to your `.pyo` files. If you encounter any specific issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
