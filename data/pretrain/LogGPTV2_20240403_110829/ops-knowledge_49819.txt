User: I have 2 .pyo python files that I can convert to .py source files, but they don't compile perfectly as hinted by decompyle's verify.
Therefore looking at the source code, I can tell that config.pyo  simply had variables in in an array:
ADMIN_USERIDS = [116901,
 141,
 349244,
 39,
 1159488]
I would like to take the original .pyo and disassembly or whatever I need to do inorder to change one of these IDs.
Or....
in model.pyo the source indicates a 
if (productsDeveloperId != self.getUserId()):
All I would want to do is hex edit the != to be a == .....Simple with a windows exe program but I can't find a good python disassembler anywhere.
Any suggestions are welcomed...I am new to reading bytecode and new to python as well.
Assistant: IDA up to 6.0 doesn't have a .pyc decompilation module.
