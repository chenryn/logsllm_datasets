**Type of Request:**  
FEATURE REQUEST

**Description:**

After integrating OpenID Connect (OIDC) into Kubernetes, it would be beneficial to have an endpoint that provides information about the currently logged-in user. This information should include the username, UID, groups, and roles. The endpoint should return JSON data similar to the following:

```json
{
  "username": "me",
  "uid": "myuid",
  "groups": [
    "admins",
    "devs",
    "etc"
  ],
  "roles": [
    "adminrole",
    "userrole",
    "etc"
  ]
}
```

This feature would serve several purposes:
1. **Testing OIDC Setup:** Users can easily verify that OIDC is configured correctly.
2. **Dashboard Display:** The Kubernetes dashboard can show the currently logged-in user.
3. **External Tool Integration:** Developers can use this endpoint to verify and display the logged-in user's information in external tools.

**Expected Behavior:**

When a user makes a request to the endpoint with a valid bearer token, the response should include the user's information in JSON format. For example:

```sh
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ASDFV..." https://myapi.k8s.io/api/path/to/whoami
{
  "username": "me",
  "uid": "myuid",
  "groups": [
    "admins",
    "devs",
    "etc"
  ],
  "roles": [
    "adminrole",
    "userrole",
    "etc"
  ]
}
```

Thank you for considering this feature request.
