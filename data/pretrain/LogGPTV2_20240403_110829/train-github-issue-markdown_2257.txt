Once OIDC is integrated, it would be helpful to have an endpoint that will
reply with information about the logged in user, mainly the username, uid,
groups and roles. Something similar to OpenShift's /oapi/v1/users/~ service.
Ideally this would return json similar to:
    {
      "username":"me",
      "uid":"myuid",
      "groups":[
                      "admins",
                      "devs",
                      "etc",
                    ],
      "roles":[
                   "adminrole",
                   "userrole",
                   "etc"
                ]
    }
That way someone can easily test that OIDC is setup correctly, the dashboard
can show who the logged in user is and external tool developers can
verify/display the logged in user.
**What you expected to happen** :
    $ curl -H "Authorization: bearer ASDFV..." https://myapi.k8s.io/api/path/to/whoami
    {
      "username":"me",
      "uid":"myuid",
      "groups":[
                      "admins",
                      "devs",
                      "etc",
                    ],
      "roles":[
                   "adminrole",
                   "userrole",
                   "etc"
                ]
    }
