User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How is it possible to receive Access Denied errors even after assigning the right permissions? I've been working on a server migration recently, and cleaning up permissions issues on some cloned Windows 2008 servers. I routinely use procmon to narrow down permissions issues and fix them, then resume testing.

Something that boggles my mind is when I assign the proper permissions, and then run the test again, and still receive the same "ACCESS DENIED" error in procmon for the same exact user that I just assigned Full Control on for that directory or registry key that fails.

How is this technically possible? Other than not having the proper ACL set, why would ACCESS DENIED be returned?

In this specific headache, I have an Active Directory account that we use to run our services that need to be able to span multiple servers, and it consistently receives ACCESS DENIED errors on HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID. I have tripled checked that this user has Full Control access on this key, yet it still happens.

For what it's worth, here are the details from procmon:

Assistant: Most likely the token for the user has not been regenerated. When a user logs in / authenticates a security token is generated to them with all of their permissions. When alterations to permissions take place the user needs to have their security token regenerated either with the local SAM or the domain controller. Usually that is only an issue for user rights assignments and not object permissions though.

Another possibility is the concept if denials taking precedence over allows. It's possible for a denial to be higher up the inheritance chain that is cascading down and causing the permission problems.
