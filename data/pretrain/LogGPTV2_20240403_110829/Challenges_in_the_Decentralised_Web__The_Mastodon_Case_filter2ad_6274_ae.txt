overview of these various protocol can be found in [21].
Researchers have also looked at security and privacy in the
DW [40, 44], mostly around securing data management. For ex-
ample, various projects have attempted to decentralise data, e.g.,
DataBox [38], SOLID [32], and SocialGate [26]. These operate local
datastores for individual users, e.g., running on a physical home
appliance. Applications wishing to access user data must be granted
permission, potentially through a prior negotiation mechanisms.
Social Network Measurements. A number of measurement
studies have analysed “centralised” social networks like Face-
book [39, 49] and Twitter [10, 15, 27]. These have revealed a range
of properties, including attributes of the social graph and content
generation. Bielenberg et al. performed the first study of a DW
application, Diaspora [5]. When inspecting its growth, they found
a network far smaller than the one we observe on Mastodon. There
has been a small set of recent works that focus on Mastodon. Zig-
nani et al. collected and released Mastodon datasets, as well as
exploring several features, e.g., the social graph, placement of in-
stances and content warnings [54, 55]. Also, studies have focused
on friend recommendations [47] and sentiment analysis [9]. We
complement these works with a focus on availability, covering the
key aspects of federation. We also inspect the nature and deploy-
ment of instances, as well as their topical interests. To the best of
our knowledge, this paper constitutes the largest study to date of
Mastodon.
7 CONCLUSION
This paper presented a large-scale measurement study of the Decen-
tralised Web (DW) through the lens of Mastodon. We focused on
exploring challenges arising from two key innovations introduced
by the DW: (i) the decomposition of a global service into many
independent instances; and (ii) the process of federation, whereby
these instances collaborate and interact.
We found that Mastodon’s design decision of giving everyone
the ability to establish an independent instance of their own has
led to an active ecosystem, with instances covering a wide variety

instance (AS) failures.
these were largely peer-to-peer, e.g., LifeSocial.KOM [18] and Peer-
SON [7], and relied on entirely decentralised protocols. Unfortu-
nately, they did not achieve widespread adoption partly due to chal-
lenges related to both performance [4] and reliability [25]. Thus, a
new wave of DW platforms has emerged that rely on a server-based
federated model, e.g., Mastodon. Before that, the most successful
platform was Diaspora, which saw growth around 2011 [19]. Di-
aspora offers Facebook-like functionality using a federated model
similar to Mastodon. However, unlike Mastodon, it relies on be-
spoke protocols (rather than standards), and its user population has
since stagnated.
Since Diaspora’s creation, several (semi-)standard federation pro-
tocols have been proposed allowing instances to exchange data [41].
These include OStatus [37], which allows real-time interaction be-
tween instances; WebFinger [24] for discovering information about
entities on other instances; and ActivityPub [1] for publishing in-
formation about social activities. Attempts have also been made
to standardise the format of these data structures, e.g., ActivityS-
treams [2]. This standardisation efforts have had a dramatic impact

of topics. However, a common theme in our work has been the
discovery of apparent forms of centralisation within Mastodon. For
example, 10% of instances host almost half of the users, and certain
categories exhibit remarkable reliance on a small set of instances.
This extends to hosting practices, with three ASes hosting almost
two third of the users.
Our simulations further confirmed that these natural pressures
towards centralisation lead to potential points of failure. For exam-
ple, it was possible to reduce the LCC in the federation graph from
92% of all users to just 46% via the removal of five ASes. Similarly,
outages in just 10 instances can remove almost half of all toots.
This is not a theoretical problem: we discovered regular instance
(and even occasional AS) outages. Looking for possible mitigations,
we experimented with simple replication strategies to find that
availability can be dramatically improved by copying toots onto
secondary instances, i.e., by reducing the level of centralisation.
Interestingly, the subscription-based strategy (loosely employed by
Mastodon currently) is not as effective as a random strategy, due
to the propensity to replicate toots onto the same set of instances
where the followers are based.
We argue that if these problems are ignored, the DW may risk
converging towards a semi-centralised system. As part of future
work, we plan to explore the longer term properties of the DW more
generally. We will also work on mitigations to some of the identi-
fied concerns (beyond the toot replication discussed in Section 5.2),
including decentralised defenses against, e.g., malicious bots. One
example of a possible mitigation is the existing instance blocking
supported by Mastodon; our future work will investigate the im-
pact that this has on the social graph and how it can be used to
filter malicious content. Importantly, we argue that mitigations and
innovations (e.g., replication) should not depend on the exposure
of user information to remote instances, and plan to experiment
with building privacy-preserving federation mechanisms. Finally,
we intend to study the effects of hate speech activities, as well
as alt-right communities like Gab [52] starting to use Mastodon
forks [34].
