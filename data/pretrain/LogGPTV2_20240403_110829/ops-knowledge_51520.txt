User: Please analyze the HTTP request process of an application, and explain the function and significance of each link.
Assistant: Usually, an application's HTTP request process includes the following links: 1. Domain name resolution (DNS resolution) resolves the domain name entered by the user into an IP address so that the client can establish a connection. The function of this link is to find the IP address of the server, so that the client can initiate a request to the server. 2. TCP connection (three-way handshake) The client and server establish a connection through the TCP protocol. The role of this link is to ensure that a reliable connection is established between the client and the server to facilitate data transmission. 3. Send HTTP request The client sends an HTTP request to the server, including request method, URL, request header, request body and other information. The role of this link is to tell the server what data the client needs and how to process the request. 4. Server processing request The server receives and processes the HTTP request sent by the client, and performs corresponding processing according to different types of requests and request header information. The function of this link is to perform corresponding processing according to the request of the client, and send the data or results back to the client. 5. Send HTTP response The server sends an HTTP response to the client, including response header, response status code, response body and other information. The role of this link is to respond to the client's request, including the request result or data. 6. Disconnect the TCP connection (wave four times) The client and server are disconnected through the TCP protocol. The role of this link is to end the entire request response process and release connection resources for the initiation of the next request.
