User: I'm looking for a Bash equivalent of Python's os.path.join. I'm trying to prompt the user for a directory path, which then will be used (with the help of path join equivalent) to do other stuff.
Assistant: You might be looking for the readlink command. You can use readlink -m "some/path" to convert a path to the canonical path format. It's not quite path.join but it does provide similar functionality.
Edit: As someone pointed out to me readlink is actually more like os.path.realpath. It is also a GNU extension and not available on all *nix systems. I will leave my answer here in case it still helps in some way.
