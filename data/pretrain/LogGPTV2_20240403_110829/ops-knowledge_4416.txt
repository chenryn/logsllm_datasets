User: I have installed java and using it in internal command with variable name:PATH and variable value: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_60\bin . Now i want add python to internal command. What variable name do I give so that it works.I tried with Name: PTH and Value:C:\Python34; its not working.
Assistant: You can create a new variable name, for example MY_PYTHEN=C:\Pythen34 . Then you need to add the variable name into system variable PATH such as,
PATH = ...;%MY_PYTHEN%
PATH is a Windows system default variable.
