Impact of central frequency: Theoretically, reducing
the central frequency can enlarge the service area, because
it can increase the signal wavelength and therefore raise the
distance required for the channel uncorrelation. In this test,
we reduce the central frequency from 2.4 GHz to 1.2 GHz
to remeasure the four metrics at Positions 1 and 2, the ra-
tio of desired signal power to jamming signal power remains
unchanged (i.e 1), and the results are shown in Table 2. For
the 2.4 GHz central frequency shown in table1, when the
receiver is moved 0.3 meter away from the desired location,
the channel cross-decorrelation is 1.21 and 1.16 at Positions
1 and 2 respectively. For the 1.2 GHz central frequency
shown in table2, a similar channel cross-decorrelation, i.e.,
1.25 at Positions 1 and 1.12 at position 2, is achieved with
an increased distance of 0.45 meter. Thus, a lower frequency
can cause a larger service area. This experimental observa-
tion is consistent with the theoretical conclusion.
Impact of signal to jamming power ratio: As dis-
cussed in Section 6.2, we can reduce the service area size
by decreasing the ratio of desired signal power to jamming

signal power. Unlike previous experiment settings that use
a ratio of 1, we decrease the ratio from 1 to 0.5 to test the
impact in position 1 and 2, and our experimental observa-
tion matches the previous discussion result. Speciﬁcally, as
shown in table1 with a ratio of 1, the throughput reduces to
approximately 0 when the receiver is 0.3 meter away from a
desired location. However, with a ratio of 0.5, the through-
put reaches zero when the receiver is 0.2 meter away from
the desired location as shown in table3. So the service area
shrinks with the decreasing signal to jamming power ratio.

8.7 Pinpoint Accuracy
We test how accurate the prototype system can pinpoint
the service to a desired location in a meeting room. Figure
12 shows the positions of the transmitter and receivers. We
place the transmitter in the front of the room (i.e. posi-
tion 0) and the desired receiver in the middle of the room
(i.e. Position 1). We also place 8 eavesdroppers scattering
around the desired receiver (i.e. at Positions 2 to 9). The
wireless communication system operates on the central fre-
quency of 2.4GHz and adopts the binary phase shift keying
(BPSK) modulation. The power ratio of the desired signal
to jamming signal is set to 1 and the bit rate is 1Mbps.

The pinpoint accuracy is displayed in Table 4. The re-
ceiver at the desired location can approximately achieve
a SNR of 14dB, a packet delivery rate of 99.27%, and a
throughput of 0.98, while eavesdroppers at undesired loca-
tions get a much worse performance. For example, an eaves-
dropper at position 5 can only achieve a SNR of 1.6dB, a
packet delivery rate of 23.26%, and a throughput of 0.03.

transmitter than the receiver (e.g. position 4), its perfor-
mance is still quite limited (e.g., a SNR of 0.8dB, a packet
delivery rate of 13.70%, and a throughput of 0.02) due to
the poor jamming signal cancelation.
9. RELATED WORK
The proposed pinpoint system utilizes multiple antennas
to deliver the service data to desired locations. The ex-
isting Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) techniques
(e.g., [20] and [1]) also explore multiple antennas to achieve
high transmission eﬃciency. The antennas used in MIMO
systems can send same signals to enhance the reliability of
the data transmission (e.g., [20]), or diﬀerent signals to in-
crease the capacity of the wireless channel (e.g., [1]). With
the proliferation of beamforming techniques [2], multiple di-
rectional antennas have been recently integrated into MIMO
systems to grant the wireless accesses to diﬀerent users si-
multaneously. This technique is known as MU-MIMO. How-
ever, MIMO and MU-MIMO techniques do not aim to pin-
point service data to desired locations. For these techniques,
any user residing in the signal coverage range of the antennas
can hear the transmit data.
There exist two other recent papers that are relevant to
this one. The scheme proposed in [21] utilizes multiple di-
rectional antennas to deliver the service to desired locations.
Speciﬁcally, each antenna sends diﬀerent portion of an orig-
inal message, and thus this message can be reconstructed at
locations where transmit signals overlap each other. How-
ever, due to the lack of channel calibration, an attacker with
high-gain, directional antennas can still capture the transmit
signals to recover the original information, even if they are
not at the desired locations. The scheme presented in [22]
proposes to jam undesired locations to prevent illegal ac-
cesses to the conﬁdential data, whereas this paper provides
service to desired locations through jamming entanglement.
Both papers are complementary to each other.
10. CONCLUSION
In the paper, we propose the pinpoint waveforming sys-
tem to enable location-restricted service access control. To
design such a system, we create the channel calibration tech-
nique that compensates the channel distortion and enables
signals sent by diﬀerent transmitters to arrive at the desired
receiver with the same shapes. We also created the jamming
entanglement technique that introduces jamming signals to
signiﬁcantly reduce the SNR at the eavesdropper but raise
the SNR at the desired receiver. We develop a prototype
system using USRPs and the experiment evaluation results
validate the feasibility of the proposed system.
