I am aware that VBScript and JScript are available, but I find them unsuitable for most of my computing needs. It would be ideal if Python, Ruby, or Perl interpreters were included by default in Windows. This way, when I develop small console applications, I wouldn't need to distribute the entire Python installation using tools like py2exe.

Is there any initiative to include such scripting languages in Windows? Do you think this is feasible, or is it not acceptable for Microsoft?

Assistant: One possible solution is to create a custom Windows installation disc with the desired scripting or programming language pre-installed. You might also want to explore this topic further on SuperUser.com or through a Google search.
