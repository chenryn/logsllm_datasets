User: Or any other normal scripting language for that matter. I know there is VBScript and JScript. But I don't really like those for any kind of computing.
I would really love to have python or ruby (or perl) interpreter installed with windows by default so when I write small console applications I wouldn't need to distribute whole python installation with it via py2exe(or similar).
Do you know if there is such incentive? Do you think this would be possible? Or it's not acceptable for Microsoft?
Assistant: You could create your own Windows Installation-Disc with the wished script or programming language installed on default..
Perhaps search on SuperUser.com (or Google) for this matter.
