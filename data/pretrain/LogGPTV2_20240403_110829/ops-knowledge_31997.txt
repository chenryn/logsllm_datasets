User: i have thousands of servers(linux), some only has python 2.x and some only has python 3.x, i want to write one script check.py can run on all servers just as $./check.py without use $python check.py or $python3 check.py, is there any way to do this?
my question is how the script check.py find the Interpreter no matter the Interpreter is python2.x and python3.x
Assistant: Considering that Python 3.x is not entirely backwards compatible with Python 2.x, you would have to ensure that the script was compatible with both versions.  This can be done with some help from the 2to3 tool, but may ultimately mean running two distinct Python scripts.
