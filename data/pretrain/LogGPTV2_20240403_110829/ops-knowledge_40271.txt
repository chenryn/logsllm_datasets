User: How to find and kill a process on a specified port using a Linux command?
Assistant: Use the following command to find the process of the specified port: ``` lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER ``` where PORT_NUMBER is the port number to be found. Use the following command to kill the PID of the specified process: ``` kill PID ``` where PID is the process ID of the process to be killed. Therefore, the two commands can be combined, namely: ``` kill $(lsof -t -i :PORT_NUMBER) ``` This command will use the `lsof -t` option to get the PID of the process and put it Pass to the `kill` command to kill the process.
