User: In a highly concurrent web system, how to perform load balancing and fault recovery? Please analyze and provide suitable solutions.
Assistant: Load balancing refers to the technology of distributing user requests to multiple servers to improve system performance, increase availability, and achieve unlimited expansion. Web system load balancing mainly includes hardware load balancing and software load balancing: 1. Hardware load balancing: request distribution and traffic control are realized through hardware devices (such as load balancers). The hardware load balancer has functions such as high-speed cache and SSL offloading, which can effectively reduce the load pressure on the web server and improve the performance and availability of the system. 2. Software load balancing: Realize request distribution and flow control by installing software. Software load balancing can use open source software such as Nginx, HAProxy, LVS, or commercial software (such as F5 BIG-IP). Fault recovery refers to the ability to quickly restore the normal operating state of the system after a Web system failure occurs. The failure recovery of the Web system mainly has the following methods: 1. Automatic failure recovery: By monitoring the running status of the Web server, once the server is found to be abnormal, it will automatically perform failover and recovery. 2. Redundant backup: Redundant backup is used to solve the single point of failure problem of the Web system. Master-slave backup, dual-machine hot backup, etc. can be used. 3. Data backup: By regularly backing up system data to prevent data loss or damage. 4. Gray scale release: Deploy the new version of the system to a small number of servers for testing, and then release it in full to reduce the risk of system failure. To sum up, in a high-concurrency web system, hardware load balancing or software load balancing can be used to implement request distribution and flow control; at the same time, automatic fault recovery, redundant backup, data backup, and grayscale publishing can be used and other ways to ensure the availability and stability of the system.
