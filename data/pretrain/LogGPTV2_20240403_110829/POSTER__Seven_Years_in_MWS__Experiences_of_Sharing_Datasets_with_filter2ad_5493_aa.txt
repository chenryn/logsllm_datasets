ABSTRACT
In 2008, the anti-Malware engineering WorkShop (MWS)
was organized in Japan. The main objective of MWS is
to accelerate and expand the activities of anti-malware re-
search. To this end, MWS aims to attract new researchers
and stimulate new research by lowering the technical ob-
stacles associated with collecting the datasets that are cru-
cial for addressing recent cyber threats. Moreover, MWS
hosts intimate research workshops where researchers can
freely discuss their results obtained using MWS and other
datasets. This paper presents a quantitative accounting of
the eﬀectiveness of the MWS community by tracking the
number of papers and new researchers that have arisen from
the use of our datasets. In addition, we share the lessons
learned from our experiences over the past seven years of
sharing datasets with the community.

INTRODUCTION
In the (cid:12)eld of anti-malware research, collecting and an-
alyzing data is a widely established approach towards un-
derstanding this rapidly evolving target. To accelerate this
highly data-driven research, it would be the most eﬀective to
stimulate new research and to attract new researchers from

various disciplines, e.g., cyber security, networking, machine
learning, and bioinformatics.
However, collecting useful data for anti-malware research
is not an easy task for individual researchers because of sev-
eral technical obstacles. For instance, operating a honeypot
is a commonly used technique to collect malware. Although
there are publicly available honeypot software packages, in-
stalling, con(cid:12)guring, and securely operating a honeypot gen-
erally requires considerable eﬀort and experience.
To (cid:12)ll this gap, the anti-Malware engineering WorkShop
(MWS) [1] was organized in 2008. The objective of MWS
is to accelerate and expand the activities of anti-malware
research by sharing community datasets among researchers.
In addition, MWS has hosted intimate research workshops
where researchers can discuss their research results obtained
using MWS and other datasets. Moreover, to encourage stu-
dent participation in the community, MWS also hosts com-
petitions (the MWS Cup), which employ the MWS Datasets.
To facilitate the goals of stimulating research and attract-
ing new researchers, the MWS Datasets have been developed
with the following noteworthy features. First, the datasets
are applicable to several attack phases: 1) probing, 2) infec-
tion, and 3) malware activities after infection, as illustrated
in Fig. 1. Second, some of the datasets assist researchers
in performing the long-term analysis. One of the datasets
was collected from 2008 to 2013, and provides communica-
tion logs from a server-side, high-interaction honeypot. In
addition, in response to attack vector transition, a drive-
by download dataset has been provided since 2010. Finally,
datasets have been developed to facilitate the correlation
of various datasets collected by diﬀerent research institutes
and industries. For example, forensic data regarding phase

by tracking the number of papers and new researchers

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides a brief summary of our datasets. In Section
3, we quantify the eﬀectiveness of the MWS community by
tracking the number of papers and new researchers that have
arisen from the use of our datasets and discuss the lessons
learned from our experiences. Section 4 discusses the related
eﬀorts to dataset sharing and Section 5 concludes our work.
2. MWS DATASETS
As shown in Fig. 1, the MWS Datasets cover three at-
tack phases, i.e., probing, infection, and malware activities.
Table 1 summarizes the datasets shared in the MWS com-
munity and their relationships. A brief overview of each
dataset is provided below:
1) Probing.
The NICTER Darknet Dataset is a set of packet traces
collected using the darknet monitoring system, NICTER [12].
Researchers can access realtime datasets using the Platform
as a Service (PaaS) environment. The set of darknets covers
approximately 210 K unused IP addresses.
2) Infection.
The CCC DATAset contains the data collected from
server-side, high-interaction honeypots that are operated by
the Cyber Clean Center [3] in a distributed manner. These
datasets contain the list of hash digests for collected malware
samples, packet traces collected on the honeypots, and the
logs of malware collection.
The IIJ MITF Dataset is a set of logs collected from
server-side, low-interaction honeypots operated by MITF [5].
As shown in Table 1 (a), this dataset can be directly cor-
related with the CCC DATAset because the data collection
period and the format of logs are common among the two
datasets.
The D3M is a set of packet traces collected from the web-
client, high-interaction honeypot system, Marionette [9]. This
data focuses on the drive-by download attacks of crawling
malicious web sites. The datasets contain packet traces for
two periods: at the time of infection and after the infection.
The latter employs the dynamic malware analysis system,
Botnet Watcher [10].
3) Malware activities.
The PRACTICE Dataset is a collection of long-term
packet traces collected from the dynamic malware analysis
system operated by the PRACTICE project [6]. The longest
analysis period is approximately one week.
The FFRI Dataset is a set of logs collected from the
dynamic malware analysis systems Cuckoo sandbox [2] and
yarai analyzer Professional [4]. The analyzed malware sam-
ples are randomly chosen from large-scale malware archives
collected from various sources.
The MARS for MWS is a set of malware dynamic anal-
ysis data collected from not-virtualized physical servers us-
ing a fake DNS server [11]. The dataset includes the mem-

ory dump and its forensic data. The malware samples an-
alyzed in the MARS datasets were collected from the CCC
DATAset (Table 1 (b)).
3. SEVEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCES
MWS has been held as a part of Computer Security Sym-
posium (CSS), which is the largest domestic security re-
search conference in Japan. Figure 2 presents the number of
papers re(cid:13)ecting malware-related topics presented at CSS.
The launch of MWS has signi(cid:12)cantly contributed to the in-
crease in the number of anti-malware research papers. In-
terestingly, not only the number of papers presented at the
MWS sessions but also the number of papers presented at
other sessions has increased.
Table 2 illustrates the growth of the MWS community.
The number of research groups in our community tripled
from 2008 to 2014. Among these research groups, roughly
30 groups constantly made yearly contracts with the MWS
organizing committee for the use of the datasets. We also
counted the number of new research groups. The new re-
search groups are those that have not worked in malware-
related research in the past and their (cid:12)rst paper on malware-
related research was presented at MWS. From the results,
we may conclude that MWS has successfully expanded the
activities of anti-malware research over the past seven years.
Finally, Table 3 lists the outcomes of MWS with respect to
the number of published papers that utilized MWS Datasets.
Note that the numbers given for 2014 are as of July 12, 2014.
In the past (cid:12)ve years, the total number of publications has
reached 30. It is also indicative of the eﬀectiveness of the
