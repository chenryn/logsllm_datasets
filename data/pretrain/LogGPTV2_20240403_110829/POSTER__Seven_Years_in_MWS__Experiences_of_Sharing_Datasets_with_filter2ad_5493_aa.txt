## Abstract
In 2008, the Anti-Malware Engineering Workshop (MWS) was established in Japan to accelerate and expand anti-malware research. MWS aims to attract new researchers and stimulate new research by lowering the technical barriers associated with collecting essential datasets for addressing recent cyber threats. Additionally, MWS hosts intimate research workshops where researchers can freely discuss their findings using MWS and other datasets. This paper quantifies the effectiveness of the MWS community by tracking the number of papers and new researchers that have emerged from the use of our datasets. We also share the lessons learned from our experiences over the past seven years of sharing datasets with the community.

## 1. Introduction
In the field of anti-malware research, collecting and analyzing data is a well-established approach to understanding rapidly evolving threats. To accelerate this data-driven research, it is most effective to stimulate new research and attract new researchers from various disciplines, such as cybersecurity, networking, machine learning, and bioinformatics.

However, collecting useful data for anti-malware research is challenging for individual researchers due to several technical obstacles. For example, operating a honeypot, a common technique for collecting malware, requires significant effort and experience, even with publicly available honeypot software packages.

To address these challenges, the Anti-Malware Engineering Workshop (MWS) was organized in 2008. The primary objective of MWS is to accelerate and expand anti-malware research by sharing community datasets among researchers. MWS also hosts intimate research workshops where researchers can discuss their results obtained using MWS and other datasets. Additionally, MWS hosts competitions (the MWS Cup) to encourage student participation in the community.

The MWS Datasets have been developed with several notable features:
1. **Applicability to Attack Phases**: The datasets cover three attack phases: probing, infection, and post-infection malware activities.
2. **Long-Term Analysis**: Some datasets, such as the communication logs from a server-side, high-interaction honeypot, were collected from 2008 to 2013.
3. **Response to Attack Vectors**: A drive-by download dataset has been provided since 2010.
4. **Data Correlation**: Datasets facilitate the correlation of various datasets collected by different research institutes and industries.

The main contributions of this paper are:
- Quantifying the effectiveness of community data sharing by tracking the number of papers and new researchers that have arisen from the use of our datasets.
- Sharing the lessons learned from our experience over the past seven years of sharing datasets with the research community.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief summary of our datasets. Section 3 quantifies the effectiveness of the MWS community and discusses the lessons learned. Section 4 discusses related efforts in dataset sharing, and Section 5 concludes our work.

## 2. MWS Datasets
As shown in Figure 1, the MWS Datasets cover three attack phases: probing, infection, and malware activities. Table 1 summarizes the datasets shared in the MWS community and their relationships. A brief overview of each dataset is provided below:

1. **Probing**:
   - **NICTER Darknet Dataset**: Packet traces collected using the darknet monitoring system, NICTER, covering approximately 210,000 unused IP addresses. Researchers can access real-time datasets using the Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment.

2. **Infection**:
   - **CCC DATAset**: Data collected from server-side, high-interaction honeypots operated by the Cyber Clean Center. Includes hash digests for collected malware samples, packet traces, and logs of malware collection.
   - **IIJ MITF Dataset**: Logs collected from server-side, low-interaction honeypots operated by MITF. Can be directly correlated with the CCC DATAset due to common data collection periods and log formats.
   - **D3M**: Packet traces collected from the web-client, high-interaction honeypot system, Marionette, focusing on drive-by download attacks. Contains packet traces at the time of infection and after infection, using the dynamic malware analysis system, Botnet Watcher.

3. **Malware Activities**:
   - **PRACTICE Dataset**: Long-term packet traces collected from the dynamic malware analysis system operated by the PRACTICE project. The longest analysis period is approximately one week.
   - **FFRI Dataset**: Logs collected from the dynamic malware analysis systems Cuckoo sandbox and yarai analyzer Professional. Analyzed malware samples are randomly chosen from large-scale malware archives.
   - **MARS for MWS**: Malware dynamic analysis data collected from non-virtualized physical servers using a fake DNS server. Includes memory dumps and forensic data. The malware samples analyzed in the MARS datasets were collected from the CCC DATAset.

## 3. Seven Years of Experiences
MWS has been held as part of the Computer Security Symposium (CSS), the largest domestic security research conference in Japan. Figure 2 shows the number of papers reflecting malware-related topics presented at CSS. The launch of MWS has significantly contributed to the increase in the number of anti-malware research papers. Not only has the number of papers presented at MWS sessions increased, but the number of papers presented at other sessions has also risen.

Table 2 illustrates the growth of the MWS community. The number of research groups in our community tripled from 2008 to 2014. Approximately 30 groups consistently made yearly contracts with the MWS organizing committee for the use of the datasets. We also counted the number of new research groups, defined as those that had not previously worked in malware-related research and whose first paper on malware-related research was presented at MWS. From the results, we conclude that MWS has successfully expanded the activities of anti-malware research over the past seven years.

Finally, Table 3 lists the outcomes of MWS with respect to the number of published papers that utilized MWS Datasets. As of July 12, 2014, the total number of publications reached 30, indicating the effectiveness of the MWS community in fostering research and collaboration.
