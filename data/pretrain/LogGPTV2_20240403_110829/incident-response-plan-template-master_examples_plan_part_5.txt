### Recover
`TODO: Customize recovery steps for ransomware.`
`TODO: Specify tools and procedures for each step, below.`
> **We do not recommend paying the ransom:** it does not guarantee a solution to the problem. It can go wrong (_e.g._, bugs could make data unrecoverable even with the key).  Also, paying proves ransomware works and could increase attacks against you or other groups.[[2, paraphrased]](#ransomware-playbook-ref-2)
1. Launch business continuity/disaster recovery plan(s): _e.g._, consider migration to alternate operating locations, fail-over sites, backup systems.
1. Recover data from known-clean backups to known-clean, patched, monitored systems (post-eradication), in accordance with our [well-tested backup strategy](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource).
    * Check backups for indicators of compromise
    * Consider partial recovery and backup integrity testing
1. Find and try known decryptors for the variant(s) discovered using resources like the No More Ransom! Project's [Decryption Tools page](https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html).
1. Consider paying the ransom for irrecoverable critical assets/data, in accordance with policy `TODO: Expand and socialize this decision matrix`
    * Consider ramifications with appropriate stakeholders
    * Understand finance implications and budget
    * Understand legal, regulatory, and insurance implications
    * Understand mechanisms (_e.g._, technologies, platforms, intermediate vendors/go-betweens)

# Roles
The following are the descriptions, duties, and training for each of the defined roles in an incident response.
`TODO: Customize roles, descriptions, duties, and training, if necessary.`
## Structure of Roles
* Command Team
  * [Incident Commander](#role-incident-commander-ic)
  * [Deputy Incident Commander](#role-deputy-incident-commander-deputy)
  * [Scribe](#role-scribe)
* Liaison Team
  * Internal [Liaison](#role-liaison)
  * External Liaison
* Operations Team
  * [Subject Matter Experts](#role-subject-matter-expert-sme) (SMEs) for Systems
  * SMEs for Teams/Business Units
  * SMEs for Executive Functions (_e.g._, Legal, HR, Finance)
During larger complex incidents, the role structure may be adjusted to account for the creation of sub-teams. Read about how we handle [complex incidents](/before/complex_incidents.md) for more information.
This is a **flexible structure**: every role will not be filled by a different person for every incident. For example, in a small incident the Deputy might act as the Scribe and Internal Liaison. The structure is flexible and scales based on the incident.
## Wartime vs. Peacetime
On incident response calls ("wartime"), a different organizational structure overrides normal operations ("peacetime"):
* The Incident Commander is in charge. No matter their rank during peacetime, they are now the highest ranked individual on the call, higher than the CEO.
* Primary responders (folks acting as primary on-call for a team/service) are the highest ranked individuals for that service.
* Decisions will be made by the IC after consideration of the information presented. Once that decision is made, it is final.
* Riskier decisions can be made by the IC than would normally be considered during peacetime.
* The IC may go against a consensus decision. If a poll is done, and 9/10 people agree but 1 disagrees. The IC may choose the disagreement option despite a majority vote.  Even if you disagree, the IC's decision is final. During the call is not the time to argue with them.
* The IC may use language or behave in a way you find rude. This is wartime, and they need to do whatever it takes to resolve the situation, so sometimes rudeness occurs. This is not personal, and something you should be prepared to experience if you've never been in a wartime situation before.
* You may be asked to leave the call by the IC, or you may even be forcibly kicked off a call. It is at the IC's discretion to do this if they feel you are not providing useful input. Again, this is not personal and you should remember that wartime is different than peacetime.
## Role: All Participants
### Description
All participants in an incident response have the responsibility to help resolve the incident according to the incident response plan, under the authority of the Incident Commander.
### Duties
#### Exhibit Call Etiquette
* Join both the call and chat.
* Keep background noise to a minimum.
* Keep your microphone muted until you have something to say.
* Identify yourself when you join the call; State your name and role (_e.g._, "I am the SME for team x").
* Speak up and speak clearly.
* Be direct and factual.
* Keep conversations/discussions short and to the point.
* Bring any concerns to the Incident Commander (IC) on the call.
* Respect time constraints given by the Incident Commander.
* If you join only one channel (call or chat), do not actively participate, as it causes disjoined communication.
* **Use clear terminology, and avoid acronyms or abbreviations. Clarity and accuracy is more important than brevity.**
##### Reference: Common Voice Procedure
Standard radio [voice procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_procedure#Words_in_voice_procedure) **is not required**, however you may hear certain terms (or need to use them yourself). Common phrases include:
* **Ack/Rog:** "I have received and understood"
* **Say Again:** "Repeat your last message"
* **Standby:** "Please wait a moment for the next response"
* **Wilco:** "Will comply"
**Do not** invent new abbreviations; favor being explicit over implicit.
#### Follow the Incident Commander
The Incident Commander (IC) is the leader of the incident response process.
* Follow instructions from the incident commander.
* Do not perform any actions unless the incident commander has told you to do so.
* The commander will typically poll for strong objections before tasking a large action. Raise objections if you have them.
* Once the commander has made a decision, follow that decision (even if you disagreed).
* Answer any questions the commander asks you in a clear and concise way.  Answering "I don't know" is acceptable. Do not guess.
* The commander may ask you to investigate something and get back to them in X minutes. Be ready with an answer within that time.  Asking for more time is acceptable, but provide the commander an estimate.
### Training
Read and understand the incident response plan, including the roles and playbooks.
## Role: Incident Commander (IC)
### Description
The Incident Commander (IC) acts as the single source of truth of what is currently happening and what is going to happen during an major incident.  The IC is the highest ranking individual on any incident call, regardless of their day-to-day rank.  They are the decision maker during an incident; they delegate tasks and listen to subject matter experts to resolve the incident.  Their decisions made as commander are final.
Your job as an IC is to evaluate the situation, provide clear guidance and coordination, recruiting others to gather context/details. **Do not perform any investigation or remediation:** delegate these tasks.
### Duties
Resolve the incident as quickly and as safely as possible using the incident response plan as a framework: lead the team to investigate, remediate, communicate.  Use the Deputy to assist you, and delegate to relevant liaisons and experts (SMEs) at your discretion.
1. Help prepare for incidents,
    * Setup communications channels for incidents.
    * Funnel people to these communications channels when there is a major incident.
    * Train team members on how to communicate during incidents and train other Incident Commanders.
1. Drive incidents to resolution,
    * Get everyone on the same communication channel.
    * Collect information from team members for their services/area of ownership status.
    * Collect proposed repair actions, then recommend repair actions to be taken.
    * Delegate all repair actions, the Incident Commander is NOT a resolver.
    * Be the single authority on system status
1. Facilitate calls and meetings,
    * Gain consensus (Poll During a Decision)
    * Provide status updates
    * Reduce scope (dismiss attendees when possible)
    * Spin off sub-teams
    * Transfer command when necessary
    * Sign off calls
    * Maintain order
    * Get straight answers
    * Handle executive swoop such as
        * Overriding the Incident Commander
        * Anti-motivation
        * Information requests
        * Questioning severity
    * Handle disruptive or belligerent responders
1. Post Mortem,
    * Creating the initial template right after the incident so people can put in their thoughts while fresh.
    * Assigning the post-mortem after the event is over, this can be done after the call.
