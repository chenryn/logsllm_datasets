User: Folks,
I believe there are two questions I have: one python specific and the other NFS.
The basic point is that my program gets the 'username', 'uid', NFS server IP and exported_path as input from the user. It now has to verify that the NFS exported path is readable/writable by this user/uid.
My program is running as root on the local machine. The straight-forward approach is to 'useradd' a user with the given username and uid, mount the NFS exported path (run as root for mount) on some temporary mount_point and then execute 'su username -c touch /mnt_pt/tempfile'. IF the username and userid input were correct (and the NFS server was setup correctly) this touch of tempfile will succeed creating tempfile on the NFS remote directory. This is the goal.
Now the two questions are:
(i) Is there a simpler way to do this than creating a new unix user, mounting and touching a file to verify the NFS permissions?
(ii) If this is what needs to be done, then I wonder if there are any python modules/packages that will help me execute 'useradd', 'userdel' related commands? I currently intend to use the respective binaries(/usr/sbin/useradd etc) and then invoke subprocess.Popen to execute the command and get the output.
Thank you for any insight.
Assistant: There is a python suite to test NFS server functionality.

While it's for NFSv4 you can simply adopt it for v3 as well.
