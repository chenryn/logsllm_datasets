**Data Collection and Analysis**

We implemented a data collection tool to gather snapshots of the IFTTT ecosystem. From November 2016 to April 2017, we collected approximately 200 GB of data, with each snapshot averaging around 12 GB. The data includes only publicly shared applets, not private ones. This methodology is similar to that used in [28], but our dataset is larger and covers a longer period.

**3.2 Data Characterization**

Our analysis reveals steady growth in services and applets over the six-month period. Compared to 11/24/2016, on 4/1/2017, the number of services, triggers, actions, and applet add counts increased by 11%, 31%, 27%, and 19%, respectively, indicating growing popularity.

For the snapshot on 3/25/2017:
- Number of services: 408
- Number of triggers: 1490
- Number of actions: 957
- Number of applets: 320K
- Total add count: 23M

**Service Semantics**

We classified services into 13 categories based on their descriptions, trigger lists, action lists, and external websites. Categories 1-4 relate to IoT devices, while categories 5-13 are non-IoT services. More than half (51.7%) of services are for IoT devices, accounting for 16% of overall IFTTT applet usage.

**IoT Usage**

Table 3 lists the top IoT-related trigger services, action services, triggers, and actions. The top three services are Alexa, Philips Hue, and Fitbit. Most triggers and actions are simple, such as "turn on light." Figure 2 shows a heat map of interactions among different service categories, highlighting the roles of IoT and non-IoT services.

**Applet Properties**

Figure 3 shows the distribution of applet usage. The top 1% (10%) of applets contribute 84.1% (97.6%) of the overall add count. Non-IoT applets often sync social networks, get notifications from online services, or trigger actions at specific times/locations. IoT applets often coordinate smart home devices or bridge IoT devices with non-IoT services.

In our dataset, there are 135,544 user channels, significantly more than the number of services (around 400). Most applets (98%) are created by users, and 86% of the add count belongs to user-made applets.

**4. Applet Execution Performance**

We measured the performance of IFTTT by conducting controlled experiments. The key metric is Trigger-to-Action (T2A) latency, which is the delay from the trigger condition being met to the action execution. We selected seven popular applets (A1-A7) and measured their T2A latency using our testbed. A Test Controller was used to automate the experiments and measure the latency.

**Table 3: Top IoT-Related Trigger Services, Action Services, Triggers, and Actions**

| Top Action Services | Add Count (in million) | Top Triggers | Add Count (in million) | Top Trigger Services | Add Count (in million) |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Philips Hue | 1.2 | Turn on lights (Hue) | 1.2 | Amazon Alexa | 1.2 |
| LIFX | 0.2 | Change color (Hue) | 0.2 | Fitbit | 0.2 |
| Nest Thermostat | 0.2 | Blink lights (Hue) | 0.2 | Nest Thermostat | 0.1 |
| Google Assistant | 0.1 | Turn on color loop (Hue) | 0.2 | Google Assistant | 0.1 |
| Harmony Hub | 0.2 | Set temperature (Nest Thermostat) | 0.2 | UP by Jawbone | 0.1 |
| Android Smartwatch | 0.1 | Start activity (Harmony Hub) | 0.2 | Nest Protect | 0.07 |
| Wemo Smart Plug | 0.1 | Send a notification (Android watch) | 0.2 | Automatic | 0.06 |

**Table 4: Popular Applets Used in Controlled Experiments**

| Applet | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A1 | If my Wemo switch is activated, add line to spreadsheet. |
| A2 | Turn on my Hue light from the Wemo light switch. |
| A3 | When any new email arrives in Gmail, blink the Hue light. |
| A4 | Automatically save new Gmail attachments to Google Drive. |
| A5 | Use Alexa’s voice control to turn off the Hue light. |
| A6 | Use Alexa’s voice control to activate the Wemo switch. |
| A7 | Keep a Google spreadsheet of songs you listen to on Alexa. |
