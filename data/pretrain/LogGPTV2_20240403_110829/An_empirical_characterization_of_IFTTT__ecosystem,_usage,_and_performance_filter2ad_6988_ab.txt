that the trigger belongs to), action name, action service, and add
count. Add count is the number of this applet being installed by
users. It quantifies the popularity of an applet and is similar to the
installation count of a mobile app.
We implemented the above data collection tool. Every week from
November 2016 to April 2017, we used the tool to take a “snapshot”
of the IFTTT ecosystem by performing the aforementioned crawl-
ing. About 200 GB data was collected during the six-month period
(∼12GB each snapshot). Note our data only contains the applets that
are publicly shared, as opposed to users’ private applets. Previous
IFTTT measurements [27, 28] also share this limitation. Note that
the crawling methodology is conceptually similar to the one used
by [28], but we captured a much larger dataset for a longer period
as shown in Table 2.
3.2 Data Characterization
We now analyze the data to reveal the up-to-date landscape of
IFTTT usage. First we notice that across the weekly snapshots
collected over the six-month period, services and applets kept
growing steadily. Compared to 11/24/2016, on 4/1/2017, the number
of services, triggers, actions, and applet add count increase by 11%,
31%, 27%, and 19%, respectively, indicating the IFTTT platform is
gaining popularity. Next, without loss of generality, we characterize
a particular snapshot collected on 3/25/2017 where the number
of services, triggers, actions, applets, and total add counts are
408, 1490, 957, 320K, and 23M respectively. We also notice the
significant increase of the applet size compared to prior studies: 67K
in 6/2013 [27], 224K in 9/2015 [28], and ∼320K in our dataset.
Service Semantics. For each service, we examine its service
description, trigger list, action list, and its external website if needed.
We then classify the service into one of the 13 categories listed

Xianghang Mi et al.
Figure 3: Add count per
applet.
Figure 2: Heat map of inter-
actions
in Table 1 based on our domain knowledge. Given the number of
services is moderate (∼400), the classification was done manually to
ensure its accuracy. In Table 1, Service Category 1 to 4 relate to IoT
devices, including controlling specific smart home devices, general
smart home hubs/controllers, wearable devices, and connected cars.
Within Category 1, we observed more than 20 types of devices
as exemplified in §1. Category 5 to 13 belong to non-IoT services
such as web applications, cloud storage, RSS feeds, smartphone,
email, time, and location. For each service category, Table 1 lists (in
percentage) its number of services, its trigger add count (i.e., the
total add count of applets whose triggers belong to a service within
this category), and its action add count. Overall, we find that the
services provided by IFTTT are extraordinarily rich. More than half
(51.7%) of services are for IoT devices. They account for 16% of the
overall IFTTT applet usage (based on the add count). This again
contrasts the most recent IFTTT measurement in 2015 [28], which
barely observed IoT related channels and recipes (i.e., services and
applets).
IoT Usage. Table 3 lists the top IoT-related trigger services,
action services, triggers, and actions. Based on their add counts, the
top-3 services are Alexa (Amazon’s intelligent personal assistant for
smart home devices like Amazon Echo), Philips Hue (smart lighting),
and Fitbit (a wearable activity tracker), followed by other popular
gadgets such as Nest Thermostat and Google Assist – IFTTT indeed
provides a way to identify popular smart home and wearable devices
on the market as well as their key usage scenarios in a “centralized”
manner (assuming their vendors publish partner services). The vast
majority of triggers and actions (e.g., “turn on light”) and henceforth
their applets are rather simple, due to the simple interfaces exposed
by most IoT devices, as well as the fact that most tasks (in the smart
home context) we want to automate are indeed simple [27]. Figure 2
plots a heat map illustrating the interaction among different service
categories. The intensity of the color block at Row i and Column j
indicates the add count of applets whose trigger and action belong
to service category i and j, respectively. We find that IoT services
may serve as both triggers (usually paired with service categories
of 1, 5, 9) and actions (paired with service categories of 1, 7, 9, 12).
Regarding non-IoT services, as illustrated in Table 1 and Figure 2,
popular services used as triggers include social networks (Category
10), online services (Cat. 7), RSS feeds (8), and time/location (12).
Many content providers such as YouTube and NYTimes have their
own IFTTT partner services. For actions, unlike IoT actions that
usually perform device control, non-IoT actions are mostly used
to notify users via push notification/email (Cat. 9), to log events to
cloud storage (6), or to publish posts to social networks (10).

Applet Properties. Now we shift our focus from services to
applets. Figure 3 quantifies the overall applet usage by ranking the
applets (X-Axis) by their add count (Y-Axis). It exhibits a heavy-tail
distribution: the top 1% (10%) of applets contribute 84.1% (97.6%)
of the overall add count. We thus next focus on the top applets.
For non-IoT applets whose neither trigger nor action relates to
IoT, we observe several top use cases such as syncing different
social networks, getting notifications from online services, and
triggering actions at certain time/locations. For IoT applets whose
either trigger or action relates to IoT, IFTTT acts as a virtual smart
home hub in the cloud by coordinating smart home devices (e.g.,
Amazon Echo and lights). More interestingly and commonly, IFTTT
helps bridge IoT devices with non-IoT services in the cloud.
In IFTTT, besides service providers, an end user can also create
her applets and share them with other users by publishing them
on her “channel”. In our dataset, we observe 135,544 user channels,
which is several orders of magnitude more compared to the number
of services (around 400). Although triggers and actions can only be
provided by services, most applets (98%) are home-made by users.
The number of published applets per user also follows a heavy-tail
distribution: the top 1% (10%) of users contribute 18% (49%) of all
applets. Also 86% of add count belong to user-made applets, which
thus dominate the applet usage.
4 APPLET EXECUTION PERFORMANCE
This section measures the performance of IFTTT by conducting
controlled experiments.
Trigger-to-Action (T2A) Latency is a key performance metric
for applet execution. It is the delay from time TT when the trigger
condition is met to time TA when the action is executed. We pick
seven popular applets A1 to A7 listed in Table 4 and measure their
T2A latency using our testbed in §2.1. All these applets were created
and deployed using regular user accounts. They are chosen to
cover a variety of IoT devices and their interactions with web
services: A1 to A4 cover different usage scenarios (IoT→WebApp,
IoT→IoT, WebApp→IoT, and WebApp→WebApp); A5 to A7 use
Amazon Alexa as the trigger, which will be found to be treated
specially by IFTTT. To facilitate the experiments, we introduce
in Figure 1 a Test Controller ❾ that serves two roles. First, it
automates the experiments by activating the trigger. For example,
to programmatically control Alexa, it plays pre-recorded voice
commands. The second role of ❾ is to measure the T2A latency by
recording TT and TA.
Figure 4 shows the T2A latency for the seven applets using the
