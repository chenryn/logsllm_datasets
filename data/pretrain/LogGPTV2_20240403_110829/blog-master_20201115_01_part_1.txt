## 背景    
在PostgreSQL中通过外部表访问SQL Server的数据, 方法较多:  
1、odbc_fdw  
2、tds_fdw  
3、ogr_fdw

# CONNECTING TO SQL SERVER FROM LINUX USING FDWS  
There are two PostgreSQL FDWs (currently maintained) I know of for connecting to SQL Server from a Linux/Unix PostgreSQL box. There is the TDS Foreign Data wrapper (tds_fdw driver) which relies on the Free TDS driver. This is a fairly light-weight FDW since it just relies on TDS which is commonly already available on Linux installs or an easy install away. Unfortunately when I tried to use it on windows (compiling my usual mingw64 way), while it compiled and installed, it crashed when I attempted to connect to my SQL Server 2008 R2 box table, so I gave up on it for the time being as a cross-platform solution. One thing I will say about it is that it accepts ad-hoc queries from what I can see, as a data source, which is pretty nice. So we may revisit it in the future to see if we can get it to work on windows. I'm not sure if tds_fdw would support SQL Server spatial geometry columns though would be interesting to try.  
The second option, which as you may have noticed, we spent much time talking about is the ogr_fdw foreign data driver. ogr_fdw utilizes UnixODBC on Linux, iODBC on MacOSX and Windows ODBC on windows for connecting to SQL Server. The ogr_fdw big downside is that it has a dependency on GDAL, which is a hefty FOSS swiss-army knife ETL tool that is a staple of all sorts of spatial folks doing both open source and proprietary development. The good thing about ogr_fdw, is that since it is a spatial driver, it knows how to translate SQL Server geometry to it's equivalent PostGIS form in addition to being able to handle most of the other not-so spatial columns.  
Although GDAL is big, the good news is that, PostGIS relies on it as well since PostGIS 2.0 to support raster functionality. That was one of my ulterior motives for pushing raster into the PostGIS extension in 2.0: There will come a day when PostgreSQL will need to reach out to vast different kinds of spatial and not-so spatial data and GDAL would be a convenient ring to do so, so lets start planting the roots.. This makes compiling and installing ogr_fdw on Linux pretty trivial if you already have PostGIS with raster support installed and even easier now that PGDG Yum packages it in the repo.  
Until recently, I've only used ogr_fdw on Windows and have been very happy with it connecting to all sorts of datasources from open-street map extract, dbase files, excel spreadsheets, MS Access databases, and SQL Server, it's a real gem. That is not to say it couldn't stand for many improvements. For a good chunk of these like OSM and MySQL and SQLite, GDAL doesn't rely on ODBC and uses the native drivers directly. Recently people have been writing me about how they can use it on Linux to connect to SQL Server. Yes, my jaw dropped, Linux people want to connect their PostgreSQL to SQL Server, why the heck would they want to do that. I thought maybe it's a good idea to try this out myself to experience first hand issues people are running into rather than simply relaying the information between people on what they tried that worked and didn't work. So here is my naive attempt to do so and distill the body of information that people have been sending me.  
There are two UnixODBC drivers you can use for connecting to SQL Server. There is the TDS based one, and in theory, if you are on CentOS/Red Hat EL (5,6) or SUSE Linux EL 11, you can also use the Microsoft provided via: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh568454%28v=sql.110%29.aspx which I have not attempted, but may in a future article.  
We'll use the more commonly available TDS driver which I think works on pretty much all Linux/Unix and MacOSX systems. This I am doing on a CentOS 7 box.  
If you installed ogr_fdw or PostGIS using, yum, then you probably have UnixODBC installed, to verify do this:  
```  
sudo yum list installed | grep unixODBC  
```  
We get this for output  
```  
unixODBC.x86_64                  2.3.1-10.el7                          @base  
```  
I should note, that if GDAL isn't compiled with UnixODBC support, you have a much harder hurdle to jump. Luckily as far as I can tell, I think GDAL is generally compiled with UnixODBC support on Linux and possibly on Mac as well.  
Next see what drivers you have installed already  
```  
odbcinst -d -q  
```  
On our CentOS 7 box, got returned:  
```  
[PostgreSQL]  
[MySQL]  
```  
## Setting up UnixODBC connection using TDS ODBC Driver  
Here are the following steps. Much of this information is gleaned from unixODBC - MS SQL Server. You need to do this if FreeTDS didn't show up as an option when querying odbc manager.  
1、Install FreeTDS Driver  
```  
sudo yum install freetds  
```  
This is a RedhatEL/CentOS/Fedora way, on Ubuntu you'd probably need to replace yum install with apt-get sudo yum install freetds  
```

Transaction Summary  
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================  
Install  1 Package  
Total download size: 1.1 M  
Installed size: 9.8 M  
Is this ok [y/d/N]: y  
```  
2、Verify you got FreeTDS compiled with UnixODBC support.  
```  
tsql -C  
```  
Output should look something like  
```  
Compile-time settings (established with the "configure" script)  
                            Version: freetds v0.91  
             freetds.conf directory: /etc  
     MS db-lib source compatibility: yes  
        Sybase binary compatibility: yes  
                      Thread safety: yes  
                      iconv library: yes  
                        TDS version: 4.2  
                              iODBC: no  
                           unixodbc: yes  
              SSPI "trusted" logins: no  
                           Kerberos: yes  
```  
3、Find where the library is installed  
```  
ldconfig -p | grep libtdsodbc.so  
```  
Should output something like  
```  
libtdsodbc.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) => /lib64/libtdsodbc.so.0  
```  
4、Now connect as postgres account. Create a driver template file, doesn't really matter where you put it or call it, since it will be copied by the installer, contents should contain  
```  
vi tds.driver.template  
[FreeTDS]  
Description     = FreeTDS for connecting to Sybase and SQL Server  
Driver          = /lib64/libtdsodbc.so.0  
```  
Make sure to replace the driver with whatever path ldconfig gave. We called ours tds.driver.template  
5、Install the driver template  
```  
su postgres      
odbcinst -i -d -f tds.driver.template  
```  
Should get an output:  
```  
odbcinst: Driver installed. Usage count increased to 1.  
    Target directory is /etc  
```  
6、Verify you now have TDS driver  
```  
odbcinst -d -q  
```  
Output should now include FreeTDS  
```  
[root@centie source]# odbcinst -d -q  
[PostgreSQL]  
[MySQL]  
[FreeTDS]  
```  
7、Register a connection to your SQL Server box  
To do this we need to create a datasource template file and register that with odbcinst manager similar to what we did with the driver as follows:  
Create a file call it tds-testmssql.datasource.template and has contents as follows. Note the [..] is the name you want to refer to your data source and should be different for each database you want to connect to.  
```  
vi tds-testmssql.datasource.template  
[MSSQLTDSTest]  
Driver  = FreeTDS  
Description     = My test database  
Trace   = No  
Server      = 192.168.1.25  
Port      = 1433  
Database        = Northwind  
TDS Version      = 7.3  
```  
using a server name or fully qualified domain name instead of the ip of the SQL Server works just as well.  
Note: From other people's experiences I been informed that TDS Version needs to be 7.3 or above to work with ogr_fdw.  
Then run:  
```  
odbcinst -i -s -f tds-testmssql.datasource.template  
```  
8、Test by connecting:  
```  
isql -v MSSQLTDSTest your_user_name your_password  
```  
You should be able to execute queries on console. For a simple exercise try this:  
```  
SELECT @@VERSION  
```  
Should output something like:  
```

## Connecting to SQL Server using ogr_fdw  
Connecting to SQL Server using ogr_fdw is more or less the same at this point regardless of if you are using Windows or Unix/Linux.
