Consider:
    let connection = await Deno.connectTls({hostname: "google.com", port: 443})
    // No ‘await’.
    connection.read(new Uint8Array(2048))
    await connection.write(new Uint8Array([0x0D, 0x0A]))
    console.log("yo")
I’d expect the `connection.write(...)` promise to resolve eventually, but
instead it does not (and the process blocks without ever logging `"yo"`).
