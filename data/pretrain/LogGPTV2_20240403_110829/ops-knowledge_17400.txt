User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why would you use EAP-TTLS instead of PEAP? As I understood EAP-TTLS and PEAP share same level of security when implemented in wireless networks. Both only provide server side authentication via certificate. 

The drawback of EAP-TTLS can be non native support in Microsoft Windows so every user has to install additional software. 

The benefit of EAP-TTLS can be support for less secure authentication mechanisms (PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP) but why would you need them in modern and properly secure wireless system?

What are you opinions? Why should I implement EAP-TTLS instead of PEAP? 
Let's say that I have most Windows users, medium Linux users and least iOS, OSX users.

Assistant: Client restrictions


iOS clients won’t support EAP-TTLS with PAP (only MsCHAPv2) unless you manually (via a computer) install a profile.
Windows clients won’t support EAP-TTLS out-of-box (you’ll need to install a software like secure2w), unless they have Intel wireless cards.
Android support almost all combinations of EAP and PEAP.




Password database restrictions

Thus, the real problem is how your passwords are stored. 

If they are in:


Active Directory, then you can use EAP-PEAP-MsCHAPv2 (Windows boxes) and EAP-TTLS-MsCHAPv2 (with iOS clients).
If you store passwords on LDAP, you can use EAP-TTLS-PAP (Windows boxes) but you will be lost about iOS.




Important Security Concerns


Both EAP-TTLS and PEAP use TLS (Transport Layer Security) over EAP(Extensible Authentication Protocol). 


As you may know, TLS is a newer version of SSL and works based on certificates signed by a trusted central authority (Certification Authority - CA).

To establish a TLS tunnel, the client must confirm it is talking to the correct server (In this case, the radius server used to authenticate users). It does that by checking if the server presented a valid certificate, issued by a trusted CA.

Problem is: normally, you won’t have a certificate issued by a trusted CA, but one issued by an ad-hoc CA you made just for this purpose. Operational system will complain to users that it doesn't know that CA and users (as oriented by you) will happily accept that.

But this poses a major security risk:

Someone can setup a rogue AP inside your business (in a bag or even on a laptop), configure it to talk to his own radius server (running on his laptop or at the own rogue AP).

If your clientes find this AP to have a stronger signal then your access points, they will try connecting to it. Will see an unknown CA (users accept), will establish a TLS tunnel, will send authentication information on this tunnel and the rogue radius will log it.

Now the important part: if you are using a plain text authentication scheme (PAP for example), the rogue radius server will have access to your users passwords.

You can solve that by using a valid certificate issued by a Certification Authority both iOS, Windows (and Android) trust. Or, you can distribute the CA root certificate to your users and inform them to refuse connecting when they see certificate problems (good luck with that).
