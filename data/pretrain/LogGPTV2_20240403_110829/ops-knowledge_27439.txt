User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: My exact problem was (Fatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using '"') on windows 10. So I navigated to the "C:\Python33\Lib\site-packages" and deleted django folder and pip folders then reinstalled django using pip and my problem was solved.
