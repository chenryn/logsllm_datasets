Abstract
The entertainment industry, facing a formidable threat from peer-to-
peer piracy networks, is exploring every possible means to attack these
networks. The industry is also employing defensive strategies to protect
media and media players from those who would extract and copy their
content. These content protection systems depend on the computer indus-
try’s newly announced ‘trusted computing’ technologies. While ‘trusted
computing’ technologies may better protect media and media players from
content extraction by pirates, we assert that the very same technologies
can be employed to better protect pirates and their peer-to-peer distribu-
tion networks from the entertainment industry.

Introduction
The viability of content piracy hinges on the resource costs of and risk from two
required steps: extracting content from its protected form and then distributing
copies of that content. History demonstrates that advances in technology often
reduce these costs. The latest such advance comes in the form of extraction
tools and peer-to-peer networks that automate both steps of the piracy process
and put them in the hands of the average consumer. In response, the enter-
tainment industry is looking to protect their content using ‘trusted computing’
technologies, which aims to place content extraction technology back outside the
reach of the average consumer. We explore the implications of such technologies
and argue that history, against the hopes of the entertainment industry, may
continue to repeat itself.
1.1
A brief economic history of piracy
The cost of pirated goods is a function of the costs of extracting content and
distributing copies. We refer to the one-time extraction cost as e (sometimes
1
called the ﬁrst-copy cost) and the per-copy distribution cost as d. The total per-
copy cost of pirating n copies thus equals e
n + d, where the cost of extraction is
amortized over the number of copies. Using this simple formula as a guide, we
brieﬂy review the evolution of the economics of piracy and set a framework for
understanding the reasoning behind the anti-piracy techniques used in the past
and those being proposed today.
Before the days of consumer-writable media, the cost of piracy was dom-
inated by the per-copy distribution cost d. No eﬀort was expended to make
it costly to extract content from media. This one-sided approach makes sense
when one considers the components of the distribution cost d: the resource costs
related to purchasing and writing media and the legal liability costs associated
with the distribution of pirated content in countries that enforce intellectual
property laws. The direct eﬀect of high resource costs is to limit the number
of pirates. Because the average consumer could not aﬀord to produce pirated
media, the entertainment industry could easily aﬀord to pursue legal action
against those few with the ﬁnancial resources for engaging in piracy. Such legal
actions had the eﬀect of increasing liability, which ultimately resulted in further
increases in per-copy distribution costs.
The advent of audiotape and videotape made recording technology and me-
dia available at a reasonable cost, and the widespread acceptance of consumer
VCRs created a demand for pirated video content.1 These technology changes
dramatically reduced d, and the entertainment industry reacted by endeavoring
to increase e.
In particular, the industry introduced anti-piracy mechanisms into content-
players and recorders in order to raise the cost of extraction high enough so that
this cost could only be justiﬁed if amortized over a large number of copies. Con-
sumer VCRs were built with technology that would refuse to record audio and
video signals from sources of copyrighted content [8]. In parallel, the entertain-
ment industry also employed patent protection and industry license agreements
to force manufacturers to include anti-piracy mechanisms in their content play-
ers. These legal barriers were meant to exclude from the content-player market
any manufacturer not complying with the anti-piracy design requirements. In-
creasing e made casual piracy prohibitively expensive, and the entertainment
industry again kept piracy at bay by investigating and prosecuting only a small
number of distributors.
The development of digital content players and cheap digital media again
dramatically changed the economics of piracy by driving the resource costs re-
lated to purchasing and writing media to near zero.2 In addition, digital media
eliminated the problem of copy degradation and further drove down the costs
of distribution. At ﬁrst, the entertainment industry reacted by delaying the
1Even though the proliferation of pirated content was limited by imperfections introduced
as copies of copies were made on analog media, these consumer technologies reduced d to the
point where the number of potential pirates could increase dramatically.
2At the time of this writing, storage costs were approximately 30 cents per gigabyte for
removable media, such as DVDs/CDs, and $1 per gigabyte for ﬁxed storage, such as hard
disks.

introduction of high-density, writable digital media into the consumer market.
However, once personal computers (PCs) advanced to the point where com-
pressed audio and video was easy to play and distribute across the Internet, it
no longer made economic sense to block the sale of high-density, writable drives
to consumers. Writable CD-ROM drives are now standard equipment on PCs,
and drives that also write to DVD will soon take their place.
A primary goal of the DVD format was to protect digital video from piracy.
As with VCRs, legal barriers and economic incentives were put in place to
ensure that manufacturers could only produce a DVD reader if it included anti-
piracy mechanisms to thwart content extraction and reverse engineering [2, page
431]. Once again, the industry’s legal eﬀorts would then focus on a smaller set
of larger pirate distributors. For these reasons the industry has ﬁercely pro-
tected the DVD format, ﬁling suit under the new Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (DMCA) to keep video content extraction tools out of the hands of con-
sumers [11, 12]. The entertainment industry has also tried, rather unsuccessfully,
to retroﬁt the CD format with similar content-extraction protections [4].
Napster was the ﬁrst system to integrate the end user into the distribution
process. The reduction in the per-copy cost of pirated content was so signiﬁcant
that the market for pirated music and video content exploded.
The market
growth was aided by an image of legitimacy resulting from extensive press cov-
erage and professional looking software. Having failed to protect content on
CDs, the recording industry attacked the distribution channel, suing Napster
as it would any other large distributor of pirated content. Though Napster’s
centralized infrastructure failed to survive legal attack, newer systems such as
Gnutella and Kazaa evolved to use distributed infrastructures more resilient to
legal action against individual components. While the Recording Industry As-
sociation of America (RIAA) is working to bring makers of piracy applications
into US jurisdiction [5] and break the corporate veil [19], these piracy networks
are designed to live on long after the demise of their creators.
Without an eﬀective way to raise extraction costs or eliminate the current
peer-to-peer distribution channels using legal attacks, the entertainment indus-
try has undertaken a two-pronged eﬀort to raise the per-copy distribution cost
seen by individual consumers. On the legal front, the industry is using high pro-
ﬁle litigation against a few individuals, in hopes of raising in all consumers the
perceived liability of using these networks [18]. It is a strategy that appears to be
having an eﬀect [14]. The industry is also learning to use a technical approach
to raising distribution costs. In particular, it is attacking the conﬁdentiality,
integrity, and availability of peer-to-peer distribution networks.
1.2
Enter ‘trusted computing’
While attacking channels for distributing pirated content has not been without
beneﬁt, it also has costs and limitations.
Thus, the entertainment industry
continues to explore new ways of protecting the content stored on media and
played by software. In particular, ‘trusted computing’ technologies promise to
enable media players within a PC to execute with the same level of resistance
3
to piracy that one would expect from a proprietary hardware player, such as
those used to play DVDs. If these technologies succeed, extracting content from
the media of the future will be signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult than ripping a CD is
today.
Part of the success of the entertainment industry’s anti-piracy eﬀort relies on
its ability to make content extraction inconvenient enough to deter the general
public. To be successful, the industry must also deter those individuals and de-
feat those systems that distribute pirated content. In short, the industry would
like to return to the days when investigation and legal actions were suﬃcient to
counter a reasonably sized set of professional pirates.
1.3
Roadmap
The per-copy cost of piracy,
e
n + d, is at the heart of the ongoing battle be-
tween the entertainment industry and content pirates. In Section 2 we explain
how ‘trusted computing’ technologies will be used to protect media players from
content-extraction attacks, increasing the pirate’s cost of extraction, e. We de-
scribe attacks that may be employed against peer-to-peer distribution of pirated
content in Section 3. If successful, these attacks will increase the pirate’s dis-
tribution costs, d, and reduce the number of copies, n, that the network is able
to distribute. In Section 4, we explore a how the ‘trusted computing’ technolo-
gies described in Section 2 can be used by pirates to secure their peer-to-peer
networks against the attacks of Section 3.

Protecting Content
To protect their content, owners will encrypt it before writing it to media or
otherwise transmitting it to media players.
Media players will be required
to provide a minimum level of resistance to content-extraction attacks before
content-owners will entrust them with the decryption keys. Because the PC
platform was not designed to resist such attacks, media players running on to-
day’s PCs cannot make such guarantees. Not surprisingly, the leading forces in
the PC market formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA), now
succeeded by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), to introduce technologies
that will enable PCs and their applications to obtain the trust of the enter-
tainment industry. Microsoft has also introduced similar technologies as part
of its next-generation secure computing base for Windows, formerly known as
Palladium.
These eﬀorts introduce into commodity computing hardware a private key
of a public key pair, as described in Arbaugh, Farber, and Smith’s early work
on secure boot processes [3]. After placing the private key into the hardware,
the manufacturer creates a signed certiﬁcate vouching that the hardware into
which the key was placed exhibits certain properties, such as tamper-resistance,
and that only this hardware was given the public key. The hardware may make
claims, or attest to statements, to a remote entity by signing these claims with
4
it’s private key. Trust in the claims certiﬁed by this remote attestation [1] process
is only as strong as the trust in the entities that has signed oﬀ on the claims.
Once claims regarding the identity and anti-piracy properties of the hardware
and BIOS have been established, the BIOS may then attest to the identity
of the code it will next execute, the operating system.
In a ﬁnal transitive
step, an operating system trusted by the remote entity may then attest to the
identity and integrity of the application it is running. In order to reduce the
number of digital signatures required, hardware registers may be used to collapse
these steps into a single claim by the hardware. Alternative approaches place
full responsibility for protecting clients in the hardware, removing the need for
attestation of the operating system [17].
If each link in the chain is trustworthy then a remote entity may rely upon
a client application to behave with the trust properties, such as resistance to
content-extraction, for which the application has been certiﬁed. Because oper-
ating systems rely upon hardware for their correct operation, and applications
rely upon operating systems for their correct operation, each attestation step
builds on the prior trust layers. If any layer turns out not to be trustworthy, it
may subvert all the layers above it.
Once a trust infrastructure is in place, the entertainment industry may pro-
tect its content by encrypting it and only transmitting the keys to those plat-
forms built from components (hardware, operating system, and applications)
that it trusts. In order to ensure the conﬁdentiality of the keys that protect
content and the unencrypted content itself, additional operating services are re-
quired to protect them while applications use them. Speciﬁcally, the operating
system must protect the applications’s memory and, if keys are to be stored
locally, its ﬁle storage. Operating system services will also be required to pro-
tect the content on its way to the screen or audio card, lest content be stolen
in a digital format on its way to the user. Microsoft’s next-generation secure
computing base for Windows provides each of these services under the names
curtained memory, secure storage, and secure input and output.
However, if humans are to eventually hear the protected audio signals and
view the protected video signals, then this protected content can also be recorded.
Since video cameras and music recorders can record and store any information
perceivable to human eyes and ears, secure output paths all the way from com-
puter to user are therefore impossible. A motivated attacker, who purchases the
highest quality viewing or listening equipment and pairs it with equipment that
can record the experience, will be able to produce a copy that is good enough
to please a vast number of consumers. These limitations are acceptable if the
goal is only to increase the cost of extraction enough to deter consumers, not
professional pirates, from making copies.
