User: I have setup a run configuration in Eclipse and need to send SIGINT (Ctrl+C) to the program. There is cleanup code in the program that runs after SIGINT, so pressing Eclipse's "Terminate" buttons won't work (they send SIGKILL I think). Typing CTRL+C into the Console also doesn't work.
How do I send SIGINT to a process running inside an Eclipse Console?
(FWIW I am running a Twisted daemon and need Twisted to shutdown correctly, which only occurs on SIGINT)
Assistant: in some versions, you can do the following.
In the Debug perspective, you can open a view called "Signals"
(Window/Show View/Signals" or Left-Bottom Icon).
You will get a list of all supported signals. Right-click and "Resume
with Signal" will give you the result you need.
