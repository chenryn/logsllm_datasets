### Title: Black Hat Asia 2023: Grand Theft House - RF Lock Pick Tool to Unlock Smart Door Locks

**Abstract:**

In recent years, the adoption of smart door locks in homes and offices has surged, driven by the desire for enhanced convenience and security. These locks leverage wireless technology, enabling seamless connectivity within IoT-enabled environments. However, as RF (Radio Frequency) technology has made our lives more convenient, it has also introduced significant security threats. Despite a decade of advancements, many of these vulnerabilities remain unaddressed due to vendors' inadequate understanding of the security implications of proprietary RF protocols.

In this presentation, we will provide an in-depth analysis of the implementation and vulnerabilities of smart door locks, with a focus on secure rolling code algorithms that utilize Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and cipher-based message authentication. Our study, which encompassed over 20 different models from 10 popular vendors, revealed that a "master key" attack is possible on several of these models. This means that once a specific model is compromised, any lock of the same model can be easily opened, allowing unauthorized access to homes and offices.

We will demonstrate a live hack using a tool we developed, which we call the "RF Lock Pick." This device, costing approximately $20 to build, can unlock any smart door lock of the same model that has been cracked. We will also cover the reverse engineering process, detailing how hackers can identify security functionalities, analyze RF signals, and create sniffer receivers to decode and decipher messages.

Furthermore, we will discuss potential mitigation strategies from the vendor's perspective and propose the adoption of one-way RF link authentication as a more secure alternative. By addressing these vulnerabilities, we aim to enhance the overall security of smart door locks and protect users from potential intrusions.

**Key Points:**
- **Background:** Increasing adoption of smart door locks and the associated security risks.
- **Methodology:** In-depth analysis of 20+ models from 10 vendors.
- **Vulnerability:** Master key attack possible on multiple models.
- **Demonstration:** Live hack using the RF Lock Pick tool.
- **Reverse Engineering:** Process for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Recommendations for vendors to enhance security.
- **Future Direction:** Proposal for one-way RF link authentication.

This presentation aims to raise awareness about the current security gaps in smart door locks and provide actionable insights for both users and manufacturers to improve the security of these devices.
