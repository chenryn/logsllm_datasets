## Security Program Hierarchy of Needs
1. **Compliance**
2. **External Validation**
3. **Continuous Monitoring**
4. **Secure System Design**
5. **Secure Network Architecture**
6. **People and Processes**

## Caveats and Considerations
- **Organizational Support:** Building a security program requires support from the organization.
- **Business Alignment:** Security must align with business objectives.
- **Realistic Expectations:** Be realistic about what can be achieved with limited resources.
- **Prioritize Time Management:** Allocate time to address ongoing issues and prevent firefighting.
- **Do the Right Thing:** Focus on implementing the right security measures, even if they are not perfect.

## People and Processes
### Within the Organization
- **Identify Key Personnel and Roles:** Understand who is involved and their responsibilities.
- **Negotiate Ownership:** Establish clear ownership of systems and processes, ideally using a RACI matrix.
- **Accountability:** Ensure that individuals take accountability seriously.
- **Set and Communicate Expectations:** Clearly define and communicate expectations.

### The Business
- **Data Ownership:** The business owns the data and compliance.
- **Liability:** The business will face fines and legal consequences for non-compliance.

### Within IT
- **Recruit Help:** Engage IT personnel in your security plans.
- **Liaison Role:** A good sysadmin or network person can serve as a security liaison.

### Embedding Security
- **Embed Security in Processes:** Make security an integral part of all processes.
- **Consistency through Automation:** Use automation to ensure consistency and enhance security.

### Process Documentation
- **Document Processes:** Create simple checklists or flow charts to document processes.
- **Integrate Security:** Identify where security can be integrated into existing processes.
- **Examples:**
  - Standardized Equipment Purchasing
  - Server and Workstation Management
  - Inventory Management

### Know Your Environment
- **Device Inventory:** Identify and map all devices on your network.
- **Network Maps:** Create both physical and logical network maps.
- **Endpoint Uses:** Document the roles and uses of endpoints (servers, workstations, phones, printers, etc.).
- **User Functions:** Understand user roles and business functions.
- **Sensitive Data:** Identify where sensitive data is stored and how it is used.
- **Automate Inventory:** Automate inventory management and alert on changes.

## Secure Network Architecture
1. **Group Endpoints:** Divide network endpoints into groups based on roles, risks, and trust levels.
2. **Create Zones:** Define network zones based on roles.
3. **Identify Risks:** Assess the risks each zone faces.
4. **Default Deny:** Deny all traffic by default.
5. **Security Controls:** Place security controls at zone boundaries for necessary traffic.

### Security Controls
- **Firewalls**
- **Protocol Enforcement**
- **IDS/IPS**
- **Netflow Information**
- **Deep Packet Inspection**
- **File Extraction and Analysis**
- **Centralized Logging**

## Secure System Design
### For Servers
- **Minimize Zone Crossings:** Systems should cross as few security zones as necessary.
- **Segment Traffic:** Use host-based firewalls to segment traffic within zones.
- **Centralized Logging:** Implement centralized logging.
- **Backups:** Regularly back up data, and use snapshots for virtualized environments.
- **Automate Account Provisioning:** Automate the creation and management of user accounts.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Aim for SSO to centralize authentication and access control.

### For Workstations
- **Standardized Image:** Design a standardized desktop image.
- **Least Privilege:** Enforce least privilege principles, avoiding local admin rights.
- **Centralized Administration:** Centralize workstation administration.
- **Automatic Updates:** Enable automatic updates.
- **Antivirus and Additional Defense:** Use antivirus and additional defense layers like EMET.
- **MAC Filtering:** Implement MAC filtering at switchports.

## Continuous Monitoring
### Host Monitoring
- **IP/Port Scans:** Conduct periodic IP and port scans.
- **Vulnerability Scans:** Perform regular vulnerability scans.
- **Log Review:** Automate log review.
- **VPN Access:** Monitor VPN access by IP and region.
- **Dropped Packets:** Track dropped packets sourced from the DMZ.
- **Privileged Accounts:** Review event logs for privileged accounts.
- **New Users and Group Memberships:** Monitor new users and group memberships.
- **Netflow Anomalies:** Detect and investigate netflow anomalies.

### Forensics and Incident Response
- **Snort with ETPro Ruleset:** Use Snort for intrusion detection.
- **urlsnarf and tcpdump:** Capture and analyze DNS traffic.
- **Cuckoo Sandbox:** Analyze suspicious binaries.
- **Immunityâ€™s El Jefe:** Monitor processes.
- **WMI for Remote Windows IR:** Use WMI for remote incident response.
- **Free/Open Source DFIR Tools:** Utilize tools like Mandiant Redline, FTK Imager, and Autopsy.

### Continuous Improvement
- **Introduce New Tools:** Regularly introduce new monitoring tools to identify and fix new problems.

## External Validation
- **External Auditors:** Consider external auditors to review your environment.
- **Industry Standards:** Verify against industry standards.
- **Penetration Testing:** Conduct external penetration testing.

## Compliance
- **Byproduct of Good Security:** Compliance should be a byproduct of a strong security program.
- **Remediation Plans:** Most auditors will accept remediation plans, even if they span multiple years.
- **Progress Over Perfection:** Slow progress is still progress.
