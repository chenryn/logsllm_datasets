tracker to appear in our dataset
We make several observations. First, we see the emer-
gence of different tracking behaviors:
the ﬁrst cookie-
based tracker in our data is from 1996: microsoft.com
as a Vanilla tracker on digital.net. The ﬁrst Per-
sonal
is in 1999:
go.com shows up on 5 different sites that year, all
also owned by Disney:
disney.com, espn.com,
sportszone.com, wbs.net, and infoseek.com (ac-
quired by Disney mid-1999 [1], before the date of our
measurement). The existence of a Personal tracker that
only appeared on sites owned by the same company dif-
fers from today’s Personal tracking ecosystem, in which
social media widgets like the Facebook “Like” button ap-
pear on many popular sites unafﬁliated with that tracker
(Facebook, in this case) [60].
More generally, we see a marked increase in quanti-
ties of trackers over time, with rises in all types of track-
ing behavior. One exception is Forced trackers — those
relying on popups — which are rare and peaked in the
early 2000s before popup blockers became default (e.g.,
in 2004 for Internet Explorer [54]). Indeed, we see third-
party popups peak signiﬁcantly in 2003 and 2004 (17 and
30 popups, respectively, compared to an annual mean of
about 4), though we could not conﬁrm all as trackers for
Figure 4. Additionally, we see an increasing variety of
tracking behavior over time, with early trackers nearly
all simply Vanilla, but more recent rises in Personal, An-
alytics, and Referred tracking.
We can also consider the complexity of individual
trackers, i.e., how many distinct tracking behaviors they
exhibit over each year’s dataset. (Note that some behav-
iors are exclusive, e.g., a tracker cannot be both Personal
and Vanilla, but others are nonexclusive.) Table 4 sug-
gests that there has been some increase in complexity in
recent years, with more trackers exhibiting two or even
three behaviors. Much of this increase is due to the rise
in Referred or Referred Analytics trackers, which receive
cookie values shared explicitly by other trackers in addi-
tion to using their own cookies in Vanilla behavior.

maximum number of APIs used increases over time, but the
max API users are not necessarily the most popular trackers.
browsers and persist identiﬁers even across cookie dele-
tion. Though the use of these APIs does not necessarily
imply that they are used for tracking (and we know of no
published heuristic for correlating API use with genuine
ﬁngerprinting behaviors), the use of these APIs neverthe-
less allows third parties to gather potentially rich infor-
mation about users and their machines. The full list of
37 ﬁngerprint-related APIs we measure (based on prior
work [3, 4, 15, 56, 57]) is in Appendix A.
We now consider third parties that are proliﬁc users
of ﬁngerprint-related APIs, calling many APIs on each
