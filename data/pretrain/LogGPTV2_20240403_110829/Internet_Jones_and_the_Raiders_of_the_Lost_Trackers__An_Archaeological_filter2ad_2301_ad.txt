### Tracker Evolution in Our Dataset

We have made several key observations regarding the emergence and evolution of different tracking behaviors within our dataset. The first cookie-based tracker, categorized as a Vanilla tracker, appeared in 1996 on digital.net, originating from microsoft.com. The first instance of a Personal tracker was observed in 1999, with go.com appearing on five different sites that year, all owned by Disney: disney.com, espn.com, sportszone.com, wbs.net, and infoseek.com (which was acquired by Disney in mid-1999 [1]). This early form of Personal tracking, where a tracker was limited to sites owned by the same company, contrasts with today's ecosystem, where social media widgets like the Facebook "Like" button are ubiquitous across many unaffiliated sites [60].

### Trends in Tracking Behaviors

Over time, we observed a significant increase in the number of trackers, with a rise in all types of tracking behavior. One notable exception is Forced trackers, which rely on popups. These were relatively rare and peaked in the early 2000s before popup blockers became standard (e.g., in 2004 for Internet Explorer [54]). Specifically, third-party popups reached their peak in 2003 and 2004, with 17 and 30 popups respectively, compared to an annual mean of about 4. However, not all of these could be confirmed as trackers for Figure 4.

Additionally, the variety of tracking behaviors has increased over time. Early trackers were almost exclusively Vanilla, but more recent years have seen a rise in Personal, Analytics, and Referred tracking.

### Complexity of Individual Trackers

We also analyzed the complexity of individual trackers, defined as the number of distinct tracking behaviors they exhibit each year. Table 4 shows that there has been an increase in complexity in recent years, with more trackers exhibiting two or even three behaviors. Much of this increase is attributed to the rise in Referred or Referred Analytics trackers, which receive cookie values shared explicitly by other trackers in addition to using their own cookies in Vanilla behavior.

### Fingerprint-Related APIs

We also measured the use of JavaScript APIs that can be used for browser fingerprinting, allowing third parties to gather rich information about users and their machines, even after cookie deletion. While the use of these APIs does not necessarily imply tracking, it provides the potential for such activities. The full list of 37 fingerprint-related APIs we measured (based on prior work [3, 4, 15, 56, 57]) is provided in Appendix A.

### Prolific API Users

Finally, we examined third parties that are prolific users of fingerprint-related APIs, calling multiple APIs on each site. Table 5 lists the most prolific API users for each year, with ties broken by coverage (the number of sites on which they appear). The maximum number of APIs used increases over time, but the most prolific API users are not necessarily the most popular trackers.

In summary, our analysis reveals a dynamic and evolving landscape of web tracking, with increasing complexity and diversity in tracking behaviors and the use of advanced techniques like fingerprinting.
