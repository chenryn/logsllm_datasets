## Current Bug
In production mode, I encounter an error related to the ripple effect on buttons. This issue does not occur in development mode.

Initially, I suspected a minification problem and reviewed my webpack configuration for Uglify. The configuration appears to be correct:

```javascript
new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
    sourceMap: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    parallel: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    compress: {
        warnings: false,
        drop_console: false,
    }
}),
```

When I click on a button with the ripple effect, the following error is logged in the console:

```
Error: Minified React error #44; visit http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=44 for the full message or use the non-minified dev environment for full errors and additional helpful warnings.

    at batchedUpdates (react-dom.production.min.js:171)
    at Q (react-dom.production.min.js:54)
```

I have identified that the `Transition.js` file is the source of the problem, and this issue only occurs when I click on a button. Therefore, I deduce that the ripple effect is the cause of the error.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
