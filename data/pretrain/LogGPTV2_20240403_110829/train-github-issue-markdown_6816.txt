## Current Bug
In production mode i have this error happening because of the ripple effect on
the Buttons. In development mode it's working perfectly.
I thought it was a minifying problem but i checked my webpack configuration
for Uglify and it seems to be good:
            new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
                sourceMap: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
                parallel: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
                compress: {
                    warnings: false,
                    drop_console: false,
                }
            }),
When i click on a Button with the effect i got this error in the console :
    Error: Minified React error #44; visit http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=44 for the full message or use the non-minified dev environment for full errors and additional helpful warnings.

I found that Transition.js is the problem and it happens only when i click on
a Button, so i deduce that it should be the ripple effect.
If you have questions ?
