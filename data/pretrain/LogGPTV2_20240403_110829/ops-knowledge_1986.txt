User:  How to build a highly available web server cluster and realize automatic failover?
Assistant: To build a highly available web server cluster, the following points need to be considered: 1. Load balancing: distribute requests to multiple servers through load balancing, thereby improving concurrency and scalability. 2. Data synchronization: Synchronize data to multiple servers to ensure data consistency. 3. Automatic failover: Set up automatic failover to ensure service availability. The following are the specific steps: Step 1: Build a server cluster You can use load balancing tools such as LVS or Nginx to build a load balancing server, and distribute requests to multiple web servers by setting different IP addresses. For the web server, you can use web server software such as Apache, Nginx, and IIS. Step 2: Data synchronization You can use tools such as MySQL master-slave replication or Galera Cluster to synchronize database data to multiple web servers to ensure data consistency. For other data that needs to be synchronized, tools such as rsync and scp can be used for synchronization. Step 3: Failover You can use Pacemaker, Heartbeat and other tools to set automatic failover. When the main server fails, the service will be automatically transferred to the standby server to ensure the availability of the service. It should be noted that the consistency of database data needs to be considered during failover, and master-slave replication of the database and VIP (Virtual IP) can be used to ensure the reliability of failover. Through the above steps, you can build a highly available web server cluster and realize automatic failover.
