# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I would like to see an Insiders edition made that updates daily like VSCode.
Otherwise a model similar to MS Edge and VS Code extensions: Monthly: stable,
beta: weekly, and alpha: daily.
If not updating from the Store (preferably it wouldn't matter), being able to
get changes from either clicking "Update" (manual update) or automatically
updating (configurable in settings) would be highly desired. ConEmu has this
feature and it's great but I'd prefer Windows Terminal.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
ConEmu has it going directly to the github release page. This would probably
be best for Windows Terminal as well. We don't have a stable yet but alpha can
be auto-built binaries created daily at midnight EST or whatever time the
Console team feels is appropriate. Beta would be auto-built binaries made
weekly. These auto-built binaries would have a summary listing all PRs (which
you could click on and examine yourself if desired) that were made since the
last binary. An auto-delete feature would need to be in place for daily
binaries to prevent the list from getting too long. Basically once a new
binary was built, the previous one would be deleted (with some checks ensuring
the build was successful and can be run and logic checking if no PRs were made
that day, then don't create a new build).
# A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
In the About dialog or in the new settings UI that's getting built, provide an
option to update with a "Check for updates" option. A setting for
automatically checking and installing updates if available.
