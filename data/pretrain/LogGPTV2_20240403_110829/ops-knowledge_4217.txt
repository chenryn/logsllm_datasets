User: Our website is suffering from large-scale DDoS attacks, please provide an effective solution to DDoS attacks.
Assistant: 1. Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network): A CDN can help withstand large-scale DDoS attacks because a CDN can spread traffic across the entire CDN network, reducing the burden on your website. 2. Use anti-DDoS high-defense IP: anti-DDoS high-defense IP can block DDoS attack traffic and forward legitimate traffic directly to the website. This solution is more common when dealing with small attacks. 3. Upgrade bandwidth and hardware: Large-scale DDoS attacks require more network bandwidth and processing power. Upgrading bandwidth and hardware can help a website defend against large-scale DDoS attacks. 4. Use a firewall: A firewall can detect and block malicious attack traffic to protect the website. The firewall can also configure IP blacklist and whitelist to prevent unauthorized access and malicious attacks. 5. Support distributed architecture: Distributed construction of the website can distribute the traffic to different servers, and prevent a certain node from becoming the focus of the attack when an attack occurs. 6. Collaborative work: DDoS attacks are highly real-time and uncertain. Working together is important to help websites respond quickly and defend against attacks. In addition, it is also necessary to update security policies in a timely manner and achieve offensive and defensive situational awareness.
