**Can I write a web application that can be hosted on both Windows (IIS web server) and Linux (Apache or lighttpd) without any changes?**

When developing a Python web application, it is possible to create a solution that is portable across different web servers and operating systems. By default, Python web applications are designed to be platform-agnostic, allowing them to run on multiple environments with minimal or no changes.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Web Frameworks**: 
   - Many popular Python web frameworks, such as Django, Flask, FastAPI, Plone, Zope, CherryPy, and TurboGears, come with built-in development servers. These frameworks abstract away many of the underlying details, making it easier to develop and deploy your application.
   - For production environments, you might want to use a more robust web server like Apache or Nginx. These servers can be configured to work with your Python application, often using WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) or FastCGI.

2. **WSGI and FastCGI**:
   - **WSGI** (Web Server Gateway Interface) is a standard for communication between web servers and web applications. It allows you to run your Python application behind a variety of web servers, including Apache, Nginx, and IIS.
   - **FastCGI** is another protocol that can be used to interface between the web server and your Python application. It is known for its performance and scalability, especially in high-traffic scenarios.

3. **Apache Configuration**:
   - If you choose to use Apache, you can configure it to work with your Python application using modules like `mod_wsgi` for WSGI applications or `mod_python` for Python Server Pages (PSP). Since Apache runs on both Windows and Linux, this setup will be portable across these platforms.
   - For example, with `mod_wsgi`, you can deploy your Django or Flask application on both IIS (using ISAPI_WSGI) and Apache without significant changes.

4. **Performance and Scalability**:
   - While the built-in development servers provided by Python frameworks are suitable for development, they are not optimized for production. Placing your application behind a full-fledged web server like Apache or Nginx can provide better performance, security, and scalability.
   - You can also consider using a reverse proxy setup where the web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) handles static content and load balancing, while forwarding dynamic requests to your Python application.

### Example Frameworks:
- **Django**: A high-level framework that follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern. It includes an ORM, authentication, and other features out of the box.
- **Flask**: A lightweight and flexible framework that is easy to get started with. It is highly extensible and can be used for small to medium-sized applications.
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

### Conclusion:
By using a well-chosen Python web framework and adhering to standards like WSGI or FastCGI, you can develop a web application that is portable across different web servers and operating systems, including Windows (IIS) and Linux (Apache or lighttpd).
