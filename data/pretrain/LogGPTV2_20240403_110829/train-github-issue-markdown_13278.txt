Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your explanation:

---

When an "accordion-group" is opened, its corresponding "accordion-toggle" element receives the "collapsed" class. This class is removed when the "accordion-group" is closed.

However, if one "accordion-group" is already open and we attempt to open another, the "collapsed" class is not being added to the "accordion-toggle" of the previously opened "accordion-group."

P.S. I apologize for any English language errors; I am French.
