I explain.
When we open an "accordion-group", his "accordion-toggle" receives a
"collapsed" class. And this class will be removed when we close this same
"accordion-group".
But now, if we have an "accordion-group" opened and we want to open another,
"collapsed" class was not appended to previous "a.accordion-toggle".
P.S. : Sorry for my english (i'm french).
