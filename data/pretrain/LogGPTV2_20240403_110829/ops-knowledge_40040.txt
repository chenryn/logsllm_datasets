I have been using the `dnspython` module in my Python projects. Recently, I attempted to use it on a new Linux installation, but I encountered an issue where the module is not being loaded. Despite my attempts to clean up and reinstall, the problem persists.

Here are the details of my environment and the steps I have taken:

```bash
$ python --version
Python 2.7.3

$ sudo pip install dnspython
Downloading/unpacking dnspython
  Downloading dnspython-1.11.1.zip (220Kb): 220Kb downloaded
  Running setup.py egg_info for package dnspython

Installing collected packages: dnspython
  Running setup.py install for dnspython

Successfully installed dnspython
Cleaning up...

$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import dns
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named dns
```

To further diagnose the issue, I checked the versions of Python and pip:

```bash
$ which python
/usr/bin/python

$ python --version
Python 2.7.3

$ pip --version
pip 1.0 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
```

I also have a firewall installed on the new machine. Although I am unsure if it should affect the import, I tried disabling it, but the issue still persists.

Additionally, I installed `dnspython` 2.0.0 from the GitHub source, but running `pip list` showed the old version 1.2.0. It only worked after I uninstalled the old version with `pip uninstall dnspython`, leaving just version 2.0.0. After that, the `import dns` command ran smoothly.

Thank you for your help.
