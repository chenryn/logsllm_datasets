User: I am looking to ingest and write Avro files in GCS with the Python SDK. Is this currently possible with Avro leveraging the Python SDK? If so how would I do this? I see TODO comments in the source regarding this so I am not too optimistic.
Assistant: You are correct: the Python SDK does not yet support this, but it will soon.
