User: Does anyone know where or how to set the default path/directory on saving python scripts prior to running?  
On a Mac it wants to save them in the top level ~/Documents directory. I would like to specify a real location. Any ideas?
Assistant: For OS X:
Open a new finder window,then head over to applications.
Locate your Python application. (For my mac,it's Python 3.5)
Double click on it.
Right click on the IDLE icon,show package contents.
Then go into the contents folder,then resources.
Now,this is the important part:
(Note: You must be the administrator or have the administrator's password for the below to work)
Right click on the idlemain.py,Get Info.
Scroll all the way down. Make sure under the Sharing & Permissions tab,your "name"(Me) is on it with the privilege as Read & Write.
If not click on the lock symbol and unlock it.
Then add/edit yourself to have the Read & Write privilege.
Lastly,as per Ned Deily's instructions,edit the line:
os.chdir(os.path.expanduser('~/Documents'))
with your desired path and then save the changes.
Upon restarting the Python IDLE,you should find that your default Save as path to be the path you've indicated.
