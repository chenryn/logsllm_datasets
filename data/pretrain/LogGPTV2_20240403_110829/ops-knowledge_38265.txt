**Setting a Default Save Directory for Python Scripts on macOS**

If you are using a Mac and would like to set a specific directory as the default location for saving your Python scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Python IDLE Application:**
   - Open a new Finder window.
   - Navigate to the "Applications" folder.
   - Locate the Python application (e.g., "Python 3.x").

2. **Access the IDLE Package Contents:**
   - Right-click (or Control-click) on the Python application and select "Show Package Contents."
   - Navigate to the `Contents` folder, then to the `Resources` folder.

3. **Modify the IDLE Configuration:**
   - Find the `idlemain.py` file within the `Resources` folder.
   - Right-click on `idlemain.py` and select "Get Info."
   - Scroll down to the "Sharing & Permissions" section.
   - Ensure that your user account has "Read & Write" permissions. If not, click the lock icon at the bottom right to unlock it, then change the permissions to "Read & Write."

4. **Edit the Default Save Directory:**
   - Open `idlemain.py` with a text editor (e.g., TextEdit or a code editor like Sublime Text or VSCode).
   - Search for the following line:
     ```python
     os.chdir(os.path.expanduser('~/Documents'))
     ```
   - Replace `'~/Documents'` with the path to your desired default directory. For example:
     ```python
     os.chdir(os.path.expanduser('/path/to/your/directory'))
     ```
   - Save the changes and close the file.

5. **Restart IDLE:**
   - Restart the Python IDLE application.
   - When you save a new script, the default directory should now be the one you specified.

By following these steps, you can set a custom default directory for saving Python scripts on your Mac.
