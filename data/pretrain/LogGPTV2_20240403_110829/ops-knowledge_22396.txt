User: I am debugging a Python code for Maya through the remote debugger in PyCharm. 
The remote debugger can catch breakpoints as expected if the code is run at the command line, but it fails to do that if the Python code is running inside Maya's Script Editor. 
The Python code is running on a Ubuntu machine while the PyCharm remote debugger is running on Windows.
I launch Maya on the Ubuntu machine from the directory that contains the script. The path mapping of PyCharm is simply set to "." for the Windows path that contains the same python script. Can you help me with this problem? Thanks a lot.
Assistant: The break points are for the ide to catch only. Maya's script editor is just a text box with fancy things
