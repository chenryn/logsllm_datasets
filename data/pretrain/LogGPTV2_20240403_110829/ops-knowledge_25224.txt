User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Please analyze the following multiple lines of logs
 0 08:09:11 combo creating device node '/udev/vcs2'
 1 08:09:11 combo creating device node '/udev/vcsa2'
 2 14:41:57 combo Detected 731.219 MHz processor.
 3 08:09:11 combo creating device node '/udev/vcsa2'
 4 08:09:11 combo creating device node '/udev/vcs2'
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: check pass; user unknown 和 authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*>  user=root
B: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*> 和 session closed for user <*>
C: check pass; user unknown 和 ALERT exited abnormally with [1]
D: creating device node '/udev/<*>' 和 Detected <*>.<*> MHz processor.
