### Analysis and Discussion

#### Total Miss
We find that 11.5–15.7% of facts were not recalled by users, suggesting they may be fake. This rate is less than half the fake answer rate for security questions [67]. Further investigation revealed that about half of these "fake facts" failed authentication because users used initials instead of full names during LEP creation but reverted to full names during authentication. This issue can be addressed with better authentication prompts.

#### Long-Term Recall
In May 2015, we invited all participants from our performance study to authenticate with their LEPs and passwords again. A total of 54 participants returned. The time between creation and authentication ranged from 104 to 231 days, with a median of 120 days. Table 3 shows the long-term authentication success in rows 9–12. Both LEP and password recall declined, but the decline was more pronounced for passwords (66%) compared to LEPs (17–47%). Therefore, LEPs are more robust for long-term recall than passwords.

#### Security Question Recall
Security questions have a wide range of recall rates after 3–6 months, from 6.4% for frequent flyer numbers to 79.2% for city of birth [67]. LEP recall with four-fact and three-fact authentication is 53–73.6%, which falls within the range of more memorable security questions.

#### Reuse
We also explored the strength of LEPs and passwords against a password-reuse attacker. The results are shown in Table 3, rows 18–19. We first investigated how many out of 10 passwords were identical for each user. A LEP fact is considered identical to another if their answers would match during authentication, accounting for capitalization, reordering, punctuation, and extraneous words. A LEP l1 is identical to LEP l2 if all of l1’s facts match l2. There were 2.7–3.1% identical LEPs, compared to 5.7% identical passwords.

Next, we investigated how many of a user's ten passwords were sufficiently similar, such that a password-reuse attacker could easily guess one if they knew the other. To define similarity, we borrowed from the Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) [46] design. Two tokens t1 and t2 are similar if more than 1/2 of the items in t2 also appear in t1. For passwords, items are characters, and for LEPs, items are facts. This definition allows us to use pam_cracklib to detect similar passwords. A password op1 is similar to op2 if:
1. More than half of op1’s characters appear in op2 (including palindromes and rotated versions).
2. Op1 differs from op2 only in case.

There were 4.6–15.4% similar LEPs in semi-guided and guided categories, respectively, compared to 31.6% similar passwords. Thus, passwords were reused more than twice as often as LEPs, and guided LEPs were reused 3× more often than semi-guided LEPs.

One possible reason for the low LEP reuse is the way we prompted users for LEPs. Whenever a LEP was to be created, we offered a randomly selected topic from our list. Users could reject topics until they found one they wanted to discuss. These prompts seem to have stimulated diverse memories, reducing LEP reuse. Servers adopting LEPs should use such prompts to lower reuse.

#### Time to Create and Authenticate
Table 3, rows 20–21, shows the median time to create and authenticate a LEP or password. LEPs require 6.7× longer to create and 3.3–4.6× longer to authenticate than passwords. This is expected, as LEPs require users to read questions and provide input that is approximately five times longer than a password.

#### Storage
LEP answers should be concatenated and stored as one or several hashes. For all-fact authentication, we store only one hash per LEP. If we allow M-fact authentication (M = 3, 4, or 5), we need to create, hash, and store combinations of facts. 77% of participants would need up to M combinations of facts for each LEP, where N is the number of all facts.

### Usability, Deployability, and Security

- **Usability**: LEPs are more robust for long-term recall and have lower reuse rates.
- **Deployability**: Servers should use diverse prompts to reduce LEP reuse.
- **Security**: LEPs are more secure against password-reuse attacks and have comparable recall rates to memorable security questions.

This structured approach provides a clear and professional presentation of the data and analysis.
