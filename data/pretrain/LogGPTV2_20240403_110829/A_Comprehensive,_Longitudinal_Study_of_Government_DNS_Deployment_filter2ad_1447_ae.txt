### Minimum Cost for DNS Registration with GoDaddy

The minimum cost to register any domain name with GoDaddy was $300. In cases where available domains are found through defective delegations, the cost to exploit these dangling records is relatively low, making it a potentially attractive target for malicious actors.

### V. Discussion

#### A. Limitations

1. **Scope of Domains Examined:**
   - Some governments may use additional domains beyond those associated with their national portals. By examining each country individually, we might have identified these additional domains. However, language and cultural variations, as well as the presence of sites spoofing government resources, complicate such a search.
   - Including only domains that we could confirm with high confidence would introduce additional bias. Therefore, at this stage, we maintained a relatively narrow, objectively-defined scope. We plan to expand the dataset in future work.

2. **Active Measurements:**
   - Our data were collected from a single vantage point in the United States. Different results might be obtained if additional vantage points were used. This could occur if authoritative nameservers respond differently based on the IP addresses from which queries are sent.
   - Since e-government websites are unlikely to distribute content from multiple sites or use geolocation-based content, we do not anticipate significant variations across multiple vantage points. Conducting measurements from additional vantage points will be an interesting direction for future work, but with a lower priority.

3. **Repetition of Measurements:**
   - As noted in Section III-C, we repeated certain measurements to account for transient failures. However, we did not repeat all measurements. Specifically, we re-ran queries for a subset of domains to ensure consistency and reliability.

### VI. Related Work

#### A. DNS Deployment Strategies

- Several studies have evaluated the robustness of DNS authoritative server deployments, often using replication as a key metric. For example:
  - Danzig et al. (1992) [32] examined the robustness of second- and third-level domains in the .edu namespace.
  - Callahan et al. (2013) [31] conducted measurements of authoritative server replication in a residential network over 14 months.
  - Hao et al. (2015) [30] characterized DNS deployment strategies and evaluated redundancy for the Alexa top 1 million domains.
  - Allman (2018) [21] evaluated trends in the number and topological diversity of authoritative servers for .net, .org, and .com domains over a 9-year period.

- Researchers have also examined common misconfigurations in ADNS deployments. For instance:
  - Pappas et al. (2004) [50] highlighted defective delegations and cyclic dependencies.
  - Kalafut et al. (2010) [51] measured the prevalence and causes of non-existent authoritative servers.
  - Phokeer et al. (2016) [52] studied defective delegations for reverse domains in AFRINIC.
  - Sommese et al. (2020) [39] measured inconsistencies between parent and child zones, showing how these can negatively impact load distribution and increase latency.
  - Akiwate et al. (2020) [20] examined zone inconsistency and defective delegation over 10 years for several TLDs.

#### B. Region-Specific DNS Research

- Previous studies have focused on regional DNS issues, such as:
  - Kagwe and Muthoni (2012) [55] examined 2000 .ke domains.
  - Hosein et al. (2019) [56] reported challenges to DNS resilience in small island nations.
  - Shi (2007) [57] examined the conformance of Chinese government domains to the China Government Domain Name Standard.
  - Islam (2008) [58] examined Bangladeshi government domain names.

- These works highlight unique challenges and patterns for various countries or geographic regions. However, none cover the same set of research questions we attempt to answer, making our study the first to examine government ADNS deployment across a wide range of countries.

- Previous research has also investigated the use of protocols designed for DNS security, focusing on regional or country-specific patterns. For example:
  - Chung et al. (2017) [59] examined how registrar policies affect DNSSEC deployment.
  - Visoottiviseth and Poonsiri (2019) [60] focused on DNSSEC deployment in Thailand.
  - Singanamalla et al. (2020) [61] examined the deployment of CAA records for governments around the world.

### VII. Conclusions

In this work, we have shown that DNS misconfigurations persist, even among critically important domains, such as those maintained by governments. Specifically, while the vast majority of domains had replicated nameservers, less than three-fourths had their nameservers located in different networks, and less than a third had them in different autonomous systems. We observed a significant increase in the number of domains relying on providers like Cloudflare and Amazon, highlighting the trend towards dependence on a few providers, even among government domains. Additionally, we uncovered defective delegations for more than 29% of the domains studied and disagreements between zones for more than 76%. Hundreds of these cases are associated with dangling records that could be exploited for domain hijacking. The prevalence of these errors among government domains is concerning, as these domains serve as authentic sources for citizens. Any failures or compromises may undermine the trustworthiness of the digital resources provided by governments. We hope that our study will promote awareness of DNS robustness and provide insights for addressing DNS misconfigurations in the future.
