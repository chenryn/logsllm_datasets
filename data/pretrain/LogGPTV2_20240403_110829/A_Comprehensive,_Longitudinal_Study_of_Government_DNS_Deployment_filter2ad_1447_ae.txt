The minimum cost to register any of the dns with GoDaddy
was 300 USD. As in the case with available domains found
through defective delegations, the cost to leverage one of these
dangling records is not high, and may easily merit the reward
for some adversaries.
V. DISCUSSION
Several of the limitations and assumptions of this work
have been mentioned previously in the context of the relevant
measurements. We reiterate some here for clarity. We also
discuss what we consider promising approaches to addressing
the issues we have highlighted.
A. Limitations
Some governments may use domains besides the one as-
sociated with the national portal for many of their resources.
By examining each country individually, we might have been
able to identify these domains. However, language and cultural
variations, as well as the presence of sites spooﬁng government
resources would complicate such a search. Including domains
that we could conﬁrm with conﬁdence would introduce addi-
tional bias. Thus, at this stage of the work, we kept a relatively
narrow, objectively-deﬁned scope. We will further expand the
dataset in our future work.
For the active measurements, our data were collected from
a single vantage point in the United States. It is possible
that we might obtain different results if using additional
vantage points. Such a situation could arise if the authoritative
nameservers we studied only answer queries from a speciﬁc
range of IP addresses, or return different responses based on
the IP addresses from which queries are sent. However, since
e-government websites are unlikely to distribute content from
multiple sites and use geolocation-based content, we do not
anticipate the results would vary greatly across multiple van-
tage points. Thus, conducting measurements from additional
vantage points will be an interesting direction for future work,
but with a lower priority.
As noted in Section III-C, we repeated certain measurements
to account for transient failures. However, we did not repeat
all that we might have. Speciﬁcally, we re-ran queries for a

for updating the parent zone may or must require the child
zone operator to conﬁrm changes out-of-band [10]. These
provisions defend against DNS hijacking. Indeed, to combat
such attacks, some researchers recommend implementing de-
fensive measures such as registry locks that would explicitly
require human interactions to change a domain’s authoritative
nameservers [48], [49].
VI. RELATED WORK
The previous works pertinent to our research include those
studying ADNS robustness, centralization, and misconﬁgura-
tions, as well as those speciﬁcally focused on government or
regional DNS resources.
A. DNS Deployment Strategies
Several studies have evaluated the robustness of DNS au-
thoritative server deployments, often using replication as a key
metric. In an early work (1992), Danzig et al. [32] examined
this aspect of deployments for second- and third-level domains
in the .edu namespace. Callahan et al. [31] conducted measure-
ments of authoritative server replication when evaluating DNS
trafﬁc captured in a residential network for 14 months between
2011 and 2012. Hao et al. [30] elaborated on measurements of
redundancy by characterizing DNS deployment strategies and
evaluating redundancy for domains using different strategies.
Their work focused on ADNS deployments for the Alexa top
1 million, and data was collected in 2014 and 2015. In a study
covering a 9-year period (2009-2018), Allman [21] evaluated
trends in the number and topological diversity of authoritative
servers for domains’ in the .net, .org and .com domains.
From a different perspective, researchers have also exam-
ined various common misconﬁgurations in ADNS deploy-
ments. Pappas et al. [50] highlighted defective delegations
and cyclic dependencies. Their measurements were conducted
using passive DNS from a university campus and active
measurements for domains randomly sampled from reverse
zone ﬁles. They demonstrated the negative impacts of mis-
conﬁgurations on performance within the DNS. Kalafut et
al. [51] measured the prevalence and causes of cases where
an authoritative server appearing in NS records with corre-
sponding glue A does not actually exist, i.e., it cannot be
resolved. The authors studied the .asia, .com, .info, .mobi, .net,
and .org zones. Phokeer et al. [52] studied the prevalence
of defective delegations for reverse domains in AFRINIC.
Sommese et al. [39] measured inconsistency between parent
and child zones, and showed how these inconsistent records
could negatively impact load distribution and increase latency
for DNS resolutions. Their study examined the .com, .org and
.net and root zones using data captured in 2019. Akiwate et
al. [20] examined similar problems using 10 years’ worth of
zone ﬁles for several TLDs. Issues such as zone inconsistency
or defective delegation often indicate the presence of dangling
DNS records, which form the focus of other works [37], [53].
They may also indicate typos, and [54] examines the threat
posed by such cases.
B. Region-Speciﬁc DNS Research
Also of interest are previous studies with a focus on regional
DNS. In a 2012 study, Kagwe and Muthoni examined 2000
.ke domains [55]. In [56], the authors reported some of the
challenges to DNS resilience for small
island nations. In
2007, Shi [57] examined to what extent domains belonging
to government entities in China conformed to the China
Government Domain Name Standard. The study covered do-
mains for 316 provincial governments and prefectures listed in
2005 and 2006. In 2008, Islam [58] examined domain names
belonging to sites operated by the Bangladeshi government.
These works highlight the unique challenges and patterns for
various countries or geographic regions. However, none of
them covers the same set of research questions we attempt
to answer, making ours the ﬁrst to study government ADNS
deployment across a wide range of countries.
Previous research has also investigated the use of protocols
designed for the security of the DNS, focusing on regional or
country-speciﬁc patterns, sometimes on governments. In [59],
the authors examined how registrar policies affect DNSSEC
deployment, focusing on a few generic TLDs as well as the
.se and .nl ccTLDs. Visoottiviseth and Poonsiri also examined
DNSSEC, focusing on deployment in Thailand [60]. Similarly,
in 2020 researchers examined the deployment of CAA records
for governments around the world [61].
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have shown that DNS misconﬁgurations
persist, even among critically important domains, such as those
maintained by governments. In particular, we found that while
the vast majority of domains had replicated nameservers, less
than three fourths had their nameservers located in different
networks, and less than a third had them in different au-
tonomous systems. We noticed an increase of multiple orders
of magnitude in the number of domains relying on providers
such as Cloudﬂare and Amazon, highlighting the trend towards
dependence on a few providers, even among government
domains. Finally, we uncovered defective delegations for
more than 29% of the domains studied and disagreement
between zones for more than 76%. Hundreds of these cases
are associated with dangling records that could be exploited
for domain hijacking. The prevalence of these errors among
government domains is of considerable concern since these
domains typically serve as authentic sources for citizens. Any
failures or compromise may undermine the trustworthiness of
the digital resources provided by governments. We hope that
our study will promote the awareness of DNS robustness and
provide insight for addressing DNS misconﬁgurations in the
future.
