User: In a large enterprise, how to effectively manage IT users in the organization to ensure that resources are not wasted and user needs are met?
Assistant: The following are recommendations for effective management of IT users: 1. Organize IT users Ensure that all IT users know exactly about the IT resources in the organization, such as computers, software, network and data storage resources, and develop appropriate policies to manage these resources. 2. Periodic review of IT users and resources Establish an IT user and resource management process based on audits and periodic reviews to ensure that IT user permissions and access remain reasonable and appropriate, and address issues in IT resource management in a timely manner. 3. Provide training Provide the training required by IT users so that they can better use the provided IT resources and comply with the IT policies, procedures and guidelines within the organization. 4. Implement an IT Service Management or IT Service Desk Management System in an organization using an IT Service Management System to improve support responsiveness, visibility and communication for IT users and maximize the benefits of IT assets. 5. Set the correct permissions to ensure that only authorized users can access IT assets, especially those assets with sensitive information. Also, make sure that unrelated users do not consume valuable IT resources in the IT system. 6. Manage IT purchases and spending Ensure there is a department or individual responsible for managing IT purchases and spending to minimize costs and ensure that all IT assets are what the organization needs and are not overbought or disposed of. 7. Conduct follow-up audits Follow up internal audit rules to conduct proper follow-up audits of IT spending, IT resources, and IT training. Also, ensure that proper risk management practices are implemented on IT systems and IT resources to reduce the risk of data breaches, cyber-attacks and other security issues.
