ABSTRACT
Mnemonic strategy has been recommended to help users generate
secure and memorable passwords. We evaluated the security of 6
mnemonic strategy variants in a series of online studies involving
5, 484 participants. In addition to applying the standard method
of using guess numbers or similar metrics to compare the gen-
erated passwords, we also measured the frequencies of the most
commonly chosen sentences as well as the resulting passwords.
While metrics similar to guess numbers suggested that all variants
provided highly secure passwords, statistical metrics told a differ-
ent story.
In particular, differences in the exact instructions had
a tremendous impact on the security level of the resulting pass-
words. We examined the mental workload and memorability of 2
mnemonic strategy variants in another online study with 752 par-
ticipants. Although perceived workloads for the mnemonic strategy
variants were higher than that for the control group where no strat-
egy is required, no signiﬁcant reduction in password recall after 1
week was obtained.

INTRODUCTION
Passwords have been the most widely adopted user authentica-
tion mechanism in the past and are likely to continue to be an im-
portant part of cybersecurity for the foreseeable future due to their
ease of use and wide deployment [8, 9, 19]. At the same time, it
is well known that there is a tension between the security and us-
ability of passwords [3, 28]. Oftentimes, secure passwords tend to
be difﬁcult to memorize (i.e., less usable), whereas passwords that
are memorable tend to be predictable. The security community has
been trying to come up with password generation strategies that
can help users generate secure and usable passwords. Candidate
strategies have been suggested by sources ranging from the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [29] to online
comics [2], and from security experts’ essays [31, 32] to online
help forums. However, these suggestions are often based on in-
tuitions instead of scientiﬁc knowledge. Little is actually known
about which strategies are effective in helping users create usable
and secure passwords.

Perhaps the most widely recommended and studied strategy is
that based on mnemonic sentences: Take a memorable sentence,
abbreviate the words, and combine them to form a password. The
strategy is generally known as the mnemonic sentence-based strat-
egy (for short, the mnemonic strategy). It appears that the general
assessment is that this is a good strategy. It is recommended by
NIST [29] and by security experts [31, 32]. To our knowledge,
three studies on this strategy have been reported, by Yan et al. [44,
45], Vu et al. [40], and Kuo et al. [24]. One standard approach
for evaluating the strength of passwords is to use password crack-
ing tools or models to check how many collected passwords can be
cracked [21, 22, 23, 27, 34, 37]. Based on this approach, Yan et
al. [44, 45] claimed that passwords generated using the mnemonic
strategy are as strong as random passwords, while the other studies
reached a somewhat mixed conclusion regarding its security [24,
40].
These existing studies, however, have limitations. First, they are
based on samples of small sizes, with less than 150 passwords un-
der the strategy in each of the three studies. Second, the approach
of relying only on checking how many passwords can be cracked
to assess the security is ﬂawed. Although such assessment provides
useful information about how such passwords fare against today’s
state of the art cracking methods, the results are often caused by
the incompatibility of the cracking techniques and the nature of the
mnemonic strategy. Even developing a strategy-speciﬁc cracking
method, as done in [24], is insufﬁcient. It is always possible that
one has overlooked some highly effective attack techniques.
We conducted a much larger study to evaluate 6 variants of the
mnemonic strategy and compared them against a control group.
When assessing the security of the variants, we went beyond the
methods used in existing studies in two ways. First, we adopted the
approach of using statistical quantities to measure the distributions
of the passwords, as articulated by Bonneau [7]. In particular, we
chose to use the β-guess-rate (λβ) [11], which measures the ex-
pected success for an attacker limited to β guesses per account. We
chose to use β = 1 and β = 10, both because they were suggested
in [12] as appropriate for defense against online guessing attacks
and because a larger β is not very meaningful for our sample sizes
(close to 800). Second, we developed a method for attacking pass-
words resulted from the mnemonic strategy, and demonstrated the
effectiveness of this attack.
We chose two of the variants and evaluated their usability in a
separate user study, in which password creation time, short-term
(i.e., within a few minutes of creation) and long-term (i.e., after 1
week) password recall, and the workload required in both password
creation and retention are evaluated.
Our studies were conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. They
were found to be eligible for exemption from IRB review because
it is research involving survey procedures, and human subjects can-
not be identiﬁed from the recorded information. Our institution’s
IRB has also allowed us to share the collected data with other re-
searchers. (The participants were warned not to use their real pass-
words.)
Contributions. The current paper is the ﬁrst to investigate the se-
curity of password generation strategy variants on a large scale.
We recruited a total number of 5, 484 participants, for an average
of 783 participants per condition, when evaluating the security of
the variants. In addition, we recruited 752 participants for evalu-
ating the usability of two variants against a control condition. Our
studies improve the understanding of password generation strate-
gies through the following contributions.
• We show that using the standard cracking-based methodol-
ogy, password sets obtained under all variants have similar
strengths and are all much more secure than the baseline.
However, using β-guess-rates, we found that using generic
instructions that have been suggested in the literature resulted
in 2.5% of the group choosing the same sentence, and the
top 10 sentences chosen by 7.8% of the group. We have also
found that converting a sentence to a password adds limited
entropy. These two facts together suggest that this variant of
mnemonic strategy is no more secure than the baseline.
• We show that combining explicit instruction of choosing a
personalized sentence that is unlikely to be chosen by others,
with the inclusion of such personalized examples, dramati-
cally increases the security of the resulting passwords. Fur-
thermore, using only the explicit instruction or the examples
alone results in less secure distributions.
• We show that the instructions for the mnemonic strategy
found in the literature and recommended by security experts
are not optimal in inducing secure password distributions.
• We found that requiring personalized choice of sentences in
mnemonic strategy variants does not reduce the usability of
the mnemonic strategy.
To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to observe and experimentally
validate the inﬂuence of the instructions and the examples accom-
panying the strategy description on the security of the resulting
passwords. It is intuitively understood that precise instructions and
demonstrative examples can improve the ease of applying a strat-
egy to generate passwords. However, the relationship between the
level of security, the instruction wording, and the examples has not
been studied before.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss re-
lated work in Section 2. We present an overview of the ﬁrst study
and the methodology used for evaluating security of the variants in
Section 3, and the evaluation results are presented in Section 4. We
then present the study regarding usability of the variants in Sec-
tion 5. We discuss the consequence of our ﬁndings as well as our
studies’ limitations in Section 6, and conclude with Section 7.
2. RELATED WORK
Evaluation of the mnemonic strategy. Yan et al. [44, 45] con-
ducted a study with college students who were given accounts on
a central computing facility. The students were randomly assigned
to three groups. The control group (95 members) were asked to
create a password with at least seven characters long that contained
at least one non-letter. The random password group (96 members)
received a sheet of paper with the letters A through Z and the num-
bers 1 through 9 printed repeatedly on it; participants were asked
to close their eyes and randomly pick eight characters. (They were
also advised to keep a written record until they had memorized the
password.) The mnemonic password group (97 members) were
told to create a sentence of 8 words and choose letters from the
words to make up a password, mixing upper-case and including at
least one non-letter. Yan et al. [44, 45] found that very few users
asked the system administrator to reset their passwords. Responses
to an email memorability survey showed that the mnemonic pass-
words were similar to the control group in terms of difﬁculty to use,
and the random passwords were found to be signiﬁcantly more dif-
ﬁcult. An attack with dictionaries (with permutations with digits)
cracked 32% for the control group, 8% for the random password
group, and 6% for the mnemonic password group. The authors
concluded “We’ve debunked another folk belief that random pass-
words are better than passwords based on mnemonic phrases. In
our study, each appeared to be as strong as the other.”
We argue that the fact that a password is generated by a sentence
that can be found on the Internet does not necessarily mean that
it is weak, given that there are likely billions or tens of billions of
sentences on Google-indexed pages. Similarly, that a size-400, 000
dictionary can crack 4% of password seems more like an indicator
of strength to us. Using a list of 400, 000 top passwords from Rock-
you, one could crack 32% of the passwords in the Yahoo password
dataset [1], and 39% of the passwords in the phpBB dataset [1]. Our
interpretation of the data in [24] is that mnemonic sentence-based
passwords are signiﬁcantly stronger than the baseline, as measured
by passwords in the Yahoo and phpBB dataset, with two caveats.
First, this is based on cracking results obtained by using their par-
ticular dictionary. Second, the conclusion may not be statistically
signiﬁcant because the dataset is small.
Other related work. One standard approach to study the strength
of password choices under different settings is to use password
cracking tools or probabilistic password models to check the num-
Vu et al. [40] studied two variations of the mnemonic strategy:
(A) Choose a sentence containing at least 6 words, and use the ﬁrst
letters from each word as the password; (B) strategy A with an ad-
ditional requirement that users should embed a special character or
digit in the password. Forty Psychology students were each asked
to create 3 passwords using one of the above strategies. In terms of
memorability, they found that participants using strategy B “took
two times longer to recall the passwords, made almost twice as
many errors before being able to recall the password, and com-
pletely forgot the password twice as often”. Within 12 hours, the
L0phtCrack4 (LC4) password cracker cracked all passwords gen-
erated with strategy A, whereas only 5% of the passwords from
strategy B were cracked.
Kuo et al. [24] conducted a study in which 144 subjects were
asked to generate mnemonic passwords, with 146 subjects in the
control group. For the control group, they used John the Ripper’s
1.2 million-word English dictionary, and were able to crack 11%
of the 146 passwords. For the mnemonic group, they collected
129, 000 sentences from the Internet and, with some mangling, cre-
ated a 400, 000-entry mnemonic password dictionary. Using this
dictionary, they cracked 4% of the 144 mnemonic passwords. A
bruteforce attack cracked an additional 8% in the control group,
and an additional 4% in the mnemonic group. Kuo et al. also
searched the Internet (using Google) for the sentences used by the
users to generate passwords, and were able to ﬁnd 65% of them
on the Internet. Based on this evidence, the authors concluded that
“Mnemonic phrase-based passwords are not as strong as people
may believe, ...”.
ber of passwords cracked [22, 27, 33, 34, 38], e.g., when fac-
ing different password policies [21, 23], when presented with
different password strength meters [15, 37], when forced to
change passwords due to organizational change of password poli-
cies [35], when forced to change passwords due to expiration [46],
when “persuaded” to include extra randomness in their password
choices [17], when allowed to replace some characters from a ran-
domly generated password [20], and when facing different guid-
ance and feedback [33]. The strength of passwords was generally
represented by using the guess number graphs, which plot the per-
centage of passwords cracked in the dataset vs. the number of pass-
word guessing attempts. Ma et al. [26] proposed the probability
threshold graphs which convey the same information as guess num-
ber graphs when assessing the quality of passwords. Bonneau [7]
proposed metrics for studying the overall level of security in large
password datasets, based only on the distribution, and not on the
actual password strings.
Schechter et al. [30] recommended to strengthen user-selected
passwords against statistical guessing attacks by allowing users to
choose any passwords they want, so long as it is not already too
popular with other users. We follow the method of using statistical
quantities to assess strength of distributions, as advocated by [7].
Some have suggested that users should simply use password
managers and remember just one password. Password managers,
however, create their own security, reliability, and convenience
problems [14, 25, 36, 47, 48]. Perhaps the biggest concern is that
a password manager software takes the security of all critical web-
sites out of the hand of the user and puts it in one piece of soft-
ware, creating a single point of failure and an attractive target for
attackers at the same time. Recently, Xing et al. [43] showed that
Unauthorized Cross-App Resource Access (XARA) vulnerabilities
on Apple OS X and iOS enable malicious applications to read pass-
words saved into Apple Keychain and passwords saved in the pop-
ular 1Password password manager. These results demonstrate the
risk of relying on one password manager for all critical websites.
3. STUDY 1: SECURITY
We studied 6 variants of mnemonic strategy. In such a strategy,
a participant is asked to ﬁrst select an easy-to-remember sentence,
and then convert the sentence into a password.
Table 1 gives the detailed descriptions of the 6 variants in our
study. We urge readers of this paper to read Table 1 before pro-
ceeding, as the differences in the strategy descriptions are impor-
tant parts of the study. Below is a summary.
• MneGenEx (Mnemonic-Generic-Example, with generic in-
struction and a generic example, similar to what used in Kuo
et al. [24]),
• MnePerEx (Mnemonic-Personalized-Example, with empha-
sis on using personalized choices of sentences that other peo-
ple are unlikely to use and a personalized example),
alized choice of sentences, but no example),
• MnePer (Mnemonic-Personalized, with emphasis on person-
• MneEx (Mnemonic-Example, with multiple personalized
examples, but no emphasis on personalized choices of sen-
tences),
• MneSchEx (Mnemonic-Schneier-Example, with some em-
phasis on personalized choices and mixed examples, sug-
gested by Schneier in [31, 32]),
• MneYanEx (Mnemonic-Yan-Example, with some emphasis
on personalized choices in some examples, used by Yan et
al. [44, 45] in their studies).
In addition to the 6 variants, a control group Control, in which
we ask for passwords containing at least 8 characters without any
extra restriction, was included in the study as well.
3.1 Study Design
We conducted the study through Amazon Mechanical Turk
(MTurk), and all participants were at least 18 years old. We limited
our data collection to participants from the United State because
the strategy variants were constructed using the English language.
The study was divided into 7 rounds, one for each of the 7 condi-
