as a service [17]. Moreover, service providers should be more trans-
parent about attacks they see and potential resiliency measures
they have in place. Furthermore, they should also be judicious,
and transparent, in their use of other third-party services as these
transitive dependencies amplify the impact.

Analyzing Third Party Service Dependencies in Modern Web Services: Have We Learned from the Mirai-Dyn Incident?
IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
8.3 Future Work
A few natural future directions include incorporating analysis
of dependencies among websites, measuring capacity of service
providers to give a better picture of their individual vulnerability,
designing a defense metric that utilizes these measurements to
estimate robustness of a website. We also envision using our frame-
work to build a service that given a website analyzes its complete
dependency structure and enables the website administrator to
make informed policy decisions on choosing new service providers.
Moreover, this dependency analysis can also be extended to study
service-level dependencies e.g., payment processors, messaging
platforms, CRM etc. We can also perform interesting case studies
on e-commerce, education, or government sector etc., to analyse
their third party dependencies.. Moreover, to categorize third party
providers, we can also extend our analysis to use other heuristics
such as abuse emails etc. This can further increase the robustness
of our algorithms mentioned in Section 3.
Availability
Our code is also publically available 2. All of the information we
analyze is publicly visible and does not raise any ethical issues.
Acknowledgments
We thank our shepherd, Kimberly C. Claffy, and all anonymous
reviewers for their insightful comments on this paper. We would
also like to acknowledge the contributions of Carolina Zarate and
Hanrou Wang in helping with a similar dependency analysis of
popular websites in 2016 and thank Antonis Manousis for his valu-
able feedback. This research has been supported in part by NSF
