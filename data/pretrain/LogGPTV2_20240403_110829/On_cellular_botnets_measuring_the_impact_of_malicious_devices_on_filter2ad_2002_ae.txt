Appendix
TM1 Client Modiﬁcations
We modiﬁed TM1 to enable control over the rate at which our ma-
licious clients inject attack trafﬁc into the HLR. Our modiﬁcation
involves adding a new test parameter, request rate, to the conﬁgura-
tion ﬁle, which will be parsed by the main control node, and passed
to the remote control nodes and ﬁnally to all the client processes.
We also altered major part of the client process, which contains
approximately 4400 lines of code, to allow multi-threading.
To regulate the attack trafﬁc, the desired amount of attack trafﬁc
is divided by the number of available attack client machines. The
remote control node at each client machine in turn splits the as-
signed amount of attack trafﬁc among the client processes running
on the machine. In each process, the main thread spawns working
thread(s) and creates the transaction request at the assigned request
rate. It randomly selects the transaction type based on the percent-
age deﬁned in the conﬁguration ﬁle and puts such request into the
queue. One or more working threads continuously retrieve requests
from the queue at a time (based on the availability of the requests in
the queue), prepare the SQL request, submit it to the HLR, and wait
for the result. They are also responsible for transaction rollback and
commit.
Each working thread creates a connection to the HLR when it
is initialized. This connection is maintained throughout its lifetime
(as with the original TM1, which each client maintains the database
connection throughout the run). Each thread also maintains a copy
of the transaction data structure and global variables table to avoid
contention and deadlock.

GSM Simulator Architecture
We use the GSM simulator built in [60] to demonstrate RACH
throughput.
In total, the project contains nearly 10,000 lines of
code (an addition of approximately 2,000 lines) and supporting
scripts. A high-level overview of the components is shown in Fig-
ure 19, where solid and broken lines indicate message and report-
ing ﬂows, respectively. Trafﬁc is created according to a Poisson
random distribution through a Mersenne Twister Pseudo Random
Number Generator [25]. The path taken by individual requests de-
pends on the ﬂow type. We focus on the data path as the behavior of
SMS and voice messages were explained in the previous iteration
of the simulator.
If the network has not currently dedicated resources to a ﬂow on
the arrival of a packet, it is passed to the RACH module. This ran-
dom access channel is implemented in strict accordance with 3GPP
TS 04.18 [4] and is tunable via max_retrans and tx_integer
values.
The accuracy of simulation was measured in two ways. The
components used by voice and SMS were previously veriﬁed us-
ing a comparison of baseline simulation against calculated block-
ing and utilization rates. With 95% conﬁdence, values fell within
±0.006 (on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0) of the mean. The simple nature
of the PDCH module allowed veriﬁcation of correctness through
baseline simulations and observation.
