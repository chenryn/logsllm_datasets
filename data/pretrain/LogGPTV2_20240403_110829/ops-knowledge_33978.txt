User: How to monitor and analyze the operation of container clusters in real time by using log collection systems such as ELK or EFK?
Assistant: Using log collection systems such as ELK or EFK, you can monitor and analyze the operation of container clusters in real time. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Install and configure a log collection system such as ELK or EFK to ensure that the log data of the container can be collected correctly. 2. Configure a log driver in the container to output the container's logs to the log collection system. 3. Set log search and filter conditions in the log collection system to monitor and analyze container logs in real time, such as finding specific log events, counting container usage, and identifying exceptions. 4. Configure alarm rules, and when an abnormal situation occurs, an alarm will be sent to notify relevant personnel in time. 5. Regularly analyze the log data of the container cluster to identify potential problems and provide suggestions for improvement.
