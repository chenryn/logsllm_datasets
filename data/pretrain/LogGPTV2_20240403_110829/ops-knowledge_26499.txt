User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Bad practice to have a "god" password? Is it bad security practice to have a password that will allow you to access any user account on a website for support purposes?  The password would be stored in a secure manner and would be super complex.  Huge mistake?

Assistant: This sounds very much like an "Administrator" account, which typically otherwise has unlimited access to the things that it's the administrator of.

The security implications of an admin account are pretty well-understood, as are the best practices. I won't go in to all the details, but your implementation breaks with best-practice on one key feature: traceablity.

You want to be able to tell who did what, especially when it comes to administrators. If an admin can log in to my account using his password, then there's no way for an auditor after-the-fact to determine what was done by me versus what was done by the admin.

But if instead the admin logs in to his OWN account with his super-secure password, then through the access he has through his own account performs some action I could have done as well -- well then now we can have a log telling who did what. This is pretty key when the manure hits the fan. And even more so when one of the admin accounts get compromised (which it will, despite your best efforts).

Also, say the business grows and you need 2 admins. Do they share the superawesome password? NO NO NO. They both get their own admin accounts, with separate tracing and logging and all that. Now you can tell WHICH admin did what. And, most importantly, you can close one of the accounts when you fire one of the admins for stealing the donuts.
