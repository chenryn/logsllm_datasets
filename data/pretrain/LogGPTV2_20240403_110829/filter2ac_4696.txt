### Title: Black Hat Asia 2019: Intel VISA - Through the Rabbit Hole

The complexity of x86-based systems has reached a point where even specialists cannot fully grasp all aspects. Recent discoveries, such as the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, along with numerous issues in the Intel Management Engine, highlight the intricate nature of these platforms. As a result, chip manufacturers must employ various methods for manufacturing verification and post-silicon debugging.

We have discovered that modern Platform Controller Hubs (PCH) and CPUs contain a full-fledged logic signal analyzer, which allows real-time monitoring of internal lines and buses. This is a gold mine for researchers. A vulnerability we previously identified, INTEL-SA-00086, enabled us to study this technology, known as Intel Visualization of Internal Signals Architecture (VISA). We believe VISA is used for verifying chips on the manufacturing line. With a vast array of settings, VISA allows for the creation of custom rules for capturing and analyzing signals. However, VISA documentation is subject to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and is not available to the public.

In our presentation, we will demonstrate how to access the full capabilities of VISA without any hardware modifications, using only publicly available motherboards. By leveraging VISA, we were able to partially reconstruct the internal architecture of the PCH and discovered dozens of devices within the chip that are invisible to the user but can access critical data. We will show how to read signals from PCH internal buses, such as the IOSF Primary and Side Band buses, and the Intel ME Front Side Bus, as well as other security-sensitive internal devices.

Join us to explore the inner workings of Intel's VISA and uncover the hidden layers of your system's architecture.
