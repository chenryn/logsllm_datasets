User: Python works on multiple platforms and can be used for desktop and web applications, thus I conclude that there is some way to compile it into an executable for Mac, Windows and Linux.
The problem being I have no idea where to start or how to write a GUI with it, can anybody shed some light on this and point me in the right direction please?
Assistant: Since python is installed on nearly every non-Windows OS by default now, the only thing you really need to make sure of is that all of the non-standard libraries you use are installed.
Having said that, it is possible to build executables that include the python interpreter, and any libraries you use.  This is likely to create a large executable, however.
MacOS X even includes support in the Xcode IDE for creating full standalone GUI apps.  These can be run by any user running OS X.
