I would like the following to work:
    julia> x, ys... = (1,2,3)
    ERROR: syntax: invalid assignment location "ys..."
This would also let us write function signatures like:
    julia> foo((a, bs...), c, ds...) = bs
    ERROR: syntax: invalid assignment location "bs..."
Which would be useful for e.g. JuliaDiff/ChainRulesCore.jl#128 (comment)
