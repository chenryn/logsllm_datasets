**User:**
Are there any hosting services available for simple applications developed using Tornado, similar to Google App Engine? Is it possible to host such an application on Google App Engine? The app I am developing is a basic student data management system (with functionalities like adding, removing, and searching records). I have developed this app using Python.

Thank you in advance.

**Assistant:**
At Heroku, the WebSockets protocol is not yet supported on the Cedar stack. However, if your Tornado application does not require WebSockets, Heroku can still be a viable option. For hosting Tornado applications that need WebSockets, you might want to consider other platforms like DigitalOcean, AWS, or even Google Cloud Run, which offer more flexibility for real-time communication features.

Additionally, Google App Engine does support Tornado applications, but you will need to ensure that your application is configured correctly to run on the platform. You can find detailed documentation and guides on how to deploy Tornado apps on Google App Engine on their official website.
