Question: Alice and Bob are using a symmetric block cipher to encrypt their communications. They are considering the security implications of various attributes of the block cipher in use. Which of the following attributes would they need to consider ensuring the confidentiality of their messages? (Select all that apply)
"A": "The block cipher should allow for multiple plaintext inputs to be mapped to the same ciphertext output to confuse potential attackers.",
"B": "The block cipher should be deterministic so that it always produces the same ciphertext output for a given plaintext input and key.",
"C": "The block length and key length must be chosen appropriately to prevent brute-force attacks by increasing the number of possible keys.",
"D": "The block cipher should use a different key for encryption and decryption to enhance the security of the communication."
Answer: BC
