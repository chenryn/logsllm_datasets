User: I have used standart ide for python - IDLE for a long time. It has convinient debug. I can write script, press F5 and it is possible to use all objects in terminal.
Now i want working with eclipse and pydev plugin. Is there any similar way to debug in eclipse?
Assistant: Yes, there is.
Just start debugging - as far as I know, you have to set breakpoint, otherwise program just run to the end. And when stopped at breakpoint, in console window, click open console icon -> choose pydev console -> PyDev Debug Console.
Let me know if it works for you.
