User: I'm under the impressions that Python runs in the Triforce smoothly. A program that runs in Windows will run in Linux. Is this sentiment correct?
Having said that, if I create my application in QT For Windows, will it run flawlessly in Linux/Mac as well?
Thanks.
Assistant: Generally - as long as you don't use code that is not covered by Qt classes - yes.
I have several time just recompiled applications I wrote in Linux(64bit) under Windows, and the other way arround. It works for me every time.
Depends on your needs, you might also find compiler problems, but I am sure you will know how to work around them. Other people mentioned some issues you should look for, just read the other posts in the question.
