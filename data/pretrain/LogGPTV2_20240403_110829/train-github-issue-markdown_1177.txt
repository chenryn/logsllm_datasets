The use case:
I'm running FastAPI behind a nginx reverse proxy, at the path
`http://localhost/api/`. The documentation front ends (swagger and redoc) are
expecting `openapi.json` at `http://localhost/openapi.json` but it's actually
routed at `http://localhost/api/openapi.json`.
Setting `openapi_url` to `/api/openapi.json` also changes the `openapi.json`
path, so now it's looking for (through the proxy)
`http://localhost/api/api/openapi.json`.
Ideally, it'd be great if we could specify the "public path" for the api.
That's how e.g. vue does it
