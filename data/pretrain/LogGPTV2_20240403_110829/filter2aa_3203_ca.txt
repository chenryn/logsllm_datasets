### RADIUS Attributes and Connection Request Processing

The RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol is used for authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) of network access. When a connection request is received, the RADIUS server evaluates the RADIUS attributes included in the request. Based on a set of predefined authorization rules and the information stored in the user account database, the RADIUS server either authenticates and authorizes the connection, sending a RADIUS Access-Accept message, or denies the request, sending a RADIUS Access-Reject message. The Access-Accept message can include connection restrictions that the access server enforces throughout the session.

#### Network Policy Server (NPS) and Internet Authentication Service (IAS)

- **NPS** (Windows Server 2008) and **IAS** (Windows Server 2003) are industry-standard RADIUS servers.
- They support various user account databases, including the local Security Accounts Manager (SAM), Windows NT 4.0-based domains, and Active Directory.
- For Active Directory, NPS and IAS can authenticate and authorize user or computer accounts in the domain, two-way trusted domains, and trusted forests with domain controllers running Windows Server 2008 or 2003.

#### User Account Databases

A user account database is a repository of user accounts and their properties. The RADIUS server uses this database to verify authentication credentials and obtain user account properties, which include authorization and connection parameters. If the user accounts are stored in a different type of database, a RADIUS proxy can forward the authentication request to a RADIUS server with access to the required database.

### RADIUS Proxies

A RADIUS proxy routes RADIUS connection requests and accounting messages between RADIUS clients and RADIUS servers. It uses information within the RADIUS message to route it to the appropriate RADIUS client or server. This is particularly useful when AAA must occur across multiple RADIUS servers in different organizations.

- **RADIUS Client**: An access server that originates connection requests or accounting messages, or another RADIUS proxy.
- **RADIUS Server**: The final RADIUS server that performs authentication and authorization, or another RADIUS proxy.

#### NPS and IAS as RADIUS Proxies

- NPS (Windows Server 2008) and IAS (Windows Server 2003) can also function as RADIUS proxies.
- They can route RADIUS messages between RADIUS clients and RADIUS servers, acting as a central switching point.

### NPS or IAS as a RADIUS Server

When used as a RADIUS server, NPS or IAS provides:

1. **Central Authentication and Authorization**: Manages all access requests from RADIUS clients and proxies.
2. **User Credential Verification**: Uses an Active Directory-based domain or the local SAM to authenticate user credentials.
3. **Connection Authorization**: Enforces connection constraints based on account dial-in properties and network policies (NPS) or remote access policies (IAS).
4. **Accounting Recording**: Stores accounting requests in a local log file or forwards them to an SQL server database for analysis.

#### Use Cases

- **Active Directory or Local SAM**: As the user account database for access clients.
- **Routing and Remote Access**: Centralize configuration and accounting for multiple dial-up, VPN, or site-to-site routers.
- **Outsourced Access**: Manage authentication and authorization for service providers.
- **Heterogeneous Access Servers**: Centralize AAA for a diverse set of access servers.

### Configuration Steps

#### Installing NPS (Windows Server 2008)

1. Open **Server Manager**.
2. Add the **Network Policy and Access Services** role.
3. Follow the wizard to complete the installation.

#### Installing IAS (Windows Server 2003)

1. Open **Add or Remove Programs**.
2. Select **Networking Services** and add the **Internet Authentication Service**.
3. Complete the installation by following the prompts.

#### Creating a RADIUS Client

- **NPS Server**:
  1. Open **Network Policy Server**.
  2. Navigate to **RADIUS Clients and Server**.
  3. Right-click **RADIUS Clients** and select **New RADIUS Client**.
- **IAS Server**:
  1. Open **Internet Authentication Service**.
  2. Right-click **RADIUS Clients** and select **New RADIUS Client**.

### Network and Remote Access Policies

- **Authentication**: Verifies the credentials of the access client.
- **Authorization**: Determines if the connection attempt is allowed based on account dial-in properties and network or remote access policies.
- **Connection Restrictions**: Can specify settings such as idle timeout, maximum session time, encryption strength, and packet filters.

### NPS or IAS as a RADIUS Proxy

- **Message Routing**: Routes RADIUS messages between RADIUS clients and servers.
- **Logging**: Records information about forwarded messages in an accounting log.

### Connection Request Processing

- **Connection Request Policies**: Determine whether to process the message locally or forward it to another RADIUS server.
- **Remote RADIUS Server Groups**: Specify the set of RADIUS servers to which messages are forwarded.

### Chapter Summary

- **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**: Extend private networks over shared or public networks using authentication, encapsulation, and encryption.
- **RADIUS**: A standard protocol for AAA, implemented in NPS (Windows Server 2008) and IAS (Windows Server 2003).
- **NPS and IAS**: Use network or remote access policies to determine authorization and connection request policies to handle incoming RADIUS messages.

### Glossary

- **Access Client**: A device requiring network access.
- **Access Server**: A device providing network access.
- **RADIUS Proxy**: Routes RADIUS messages between clients and servers.
- **RADIUS Server**: Processes RADIUS requests and sends responses.
- **VPN**: A secure connection over a public network, emulating a private link.
