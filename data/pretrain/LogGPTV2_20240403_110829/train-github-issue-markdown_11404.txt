# Environment
    Windows build number: 18950
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.3
    Any other software? Python, Firefox, Visual Studio, etc. They shouldn't impact this problem.
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Open the Windows Settings app.
  2. Change from dark mode to light mode, or vice versa.
# Expected behavior
The Windows Terminal title bar color will change after a simple change in the
Settings app and adapt to the rest of the Windows environment.
# Actual behavior
The Windows Terminal title bar color stays the same after the Settings app
dark/light mode change. I have to restart the app in order for the Terminal
title bar to obey the Settings change.
(Not talking about accent color, by the way)
