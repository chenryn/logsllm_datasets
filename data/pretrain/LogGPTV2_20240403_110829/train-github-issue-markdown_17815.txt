Debug code leftover in production is smelly, but there are cases where this
occurs (for example you are debugging somethin in production and you run the
same codebase in development and production mode on different ports or
domains).
In such a case it would help alot if the `dump` function would be replaced
with an empty stub (or something that sends warning messages to the logger
that there is a forgotten `dump` function in the code) to not exit at this
position with an "call to undefined function".
