# Analysis of ADSL Traffic and Performance Limitations

## 1. Introduction
This document presents an analysis of the root causes affecting the throughput and performance of ADSL traffic, focusing on a case study involving over one thousand clients. The study reveals that most of the observed limitations are due to application-level constraints, particularly in P2P (Peer-to-Peer) applications like eDonkey and BitTorrent.

## 2. Data and Methodology
The analysis is based on one day's worth of ADSL traffic generated by more than one thousand clients. We used a TCP root cause analysis (RCA) tool to identify the primary factors limiting throughput. The data was collected and analyzed to understand the impact of different root causes on access link utilization.

## 3. Results and Discussion

### 3.1 Root Causes of Throughput Limitations
The main root causes identified in the analysis are:
- **Application limitation**: This is the most common cause, where the application itself limits the throughput.
- **Network limitation**: This occurs when a distant link in the network is the bottleneck.
- **Access link saturation**: This happens when the local access link is fully utilized.

### 3.2 Impact on Download Traffic
In the download direction, the traffic limited by a distant bottleneck reaches a significant proportion in the late afternoon, almost as important as the application-limited download traffic. This peak in the late afternoon suggests higher overall network utilization after working hours, leading to increased cross-traffic in aggregating links. Interestingly, the amount of traffic limited by the access link remains very low, indicating that these two groups represent different types of clients.

### 3.3 Access Link Utilization
To understand how the three main root causes impact the access link utilization, we focused on the 30-minute period during which each client achieved its highest instantaneous throughput. The results show:
- **Uplink Utilization**: For unshared bottlenecks, the uplink utilization is close to 100% in approximately 70% of cases. In the remaining 30%, the utilization ranges between 40% and 85%, possibly due to a distant downlink or misclassification.
- **Downlink Utilization**: Application-limited traffic, primarily from eDonkey, results in poor downlink utilization. This is likely due to users setting low upload rate limits in their P2P applications, even though they have multiple parallel download connections.

### 3.4 Comparison with Previous Studies
Previous studies, such as the work by Zhang et al. [4], found that congestion (similar to network limitation) and host window limitation (TCP end-point) were the most common limiting factors. However, these studies were conducted in 2001-2002, before the widespread use of P2P applications like eDonkey. Our findings suggest that the current landscape is dominated by application-level limitations, particularly in P2P traffic.

### 3.5 Implications for Service Providers and Users
By severely limiting the aggregate upload rate, P2P users ensure that their traffic does not interfere with other activities such as web browsing or IP telephony. However, this comes at the cost of very long download times, making the current rate limitation strategies inefficient from a user's perspective. For service providers, this low access link utilization means lower overall network utilization, but it also leaves room for dramatic changes if new P2P applications or upgrades increase uplink usage.

## 4. Conclusions
Our analysis of one day's ADSL traffic from over one thousand clients shows that most of the traffic is application-limited, particularly in P2P applications. Other root causes, such as network limitations and access link saturation, play a minor role. The implications of these findings include inefficient P2P download times for users and low overall network utilization for service providers.
