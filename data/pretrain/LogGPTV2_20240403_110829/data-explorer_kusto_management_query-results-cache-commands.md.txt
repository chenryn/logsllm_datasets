# Query results cache commands
The query results cache is a cache dedicated for storing query results. For more information, see [Query results cache](../query/query-results-cache.md).

   Use this command to show statistics exposed by the results cache.
* [`Clear cache(rhs:string)`](clear-query-results-cache-command.md):
   Use this command to clear cached results.
