millisecond-level. Hence, the data consumer can take a less
cost to access the data that is previously encrypted in an
IBBE ciphertext.
From the above experimental results, our ACCRE scheme
provides an eﬃcient way for data owners to protect their
data. Before outsourcing the data to the DSP, the data
owners can encrypt the data at a very low cost through the
IBBE so that a group of authorized users can access. When
deciding to transmit the outsourced data to a user equipped
with IBE, the data owner takes an even less time to generate
a conversion key. The ﬁle conversion mechanism transforms
an IBBE encrypted ﬁle into an IBE encrypted one so that
the IBE user can recover the data without altering his/her
IBE decryption key nor spending much time. During the ﬁle
conversion, the DSP, the Admin and the IBE user are not
required to take part in the process. These features make
our ACCRE a prominent solution to transform an encrypted
ﬁle into another ﬁle that can be easily accessed by a mobile
device.
In this paper we proposed a new encryption paradigm,
referred to as asymmetric cross-cryptosystem re-encryption
(ACCRE) to convert encrypted data for resource-asymmetric
computing devices. The novelty of the ACCRE is that it
integrates a complicated yet versatile IBBE scheme and a
simple yet eﬃcient IBE scheme with a secure ciphertext con-
version from the former to the latter. This feature renders
the ACCRE especially suitable for the applications where
an IBBE and an IBE are deployed for resource-asymmetric
computing devices and a conversion mechanism is required
to transform the complicated IBBE ciphertext into a sim-
ple IBE ciphertext aﬀordable to resource-limited access de-
vices. We constructed an ACCRE scheme with short ci-
phertexts and secret keys by proposing a key blinding tech-
nique and using an IBE scheme compatible with an ex-
isting IBBE scheme. We proved the security of the pro-
posed ACCRE scheme in a rigorous deﬁnition. The theo-
retical and experimental analyses showed that mobile users
take little costs to access encrypted data. We note none
of existing re-encryption schemes between diﬀerent cryp-
tosystems, i.e., the Matsuo PKE-to-IBE scheme [31] and
our IBBE-to-IBE scheme, are secure against collusions from
the proxy and non-authorized users but cannot prevent col-
lusion attacks from a malicious proxy and authorized re-
encryption receivers. This may incurs practical vulnerabili-
ties in some applications. Hence, it seems interesting to de-
sign re-encryption scheme secure against this kind of strong
colluding attacks.

APPENDIX
A. PROOF OF THEOREM 1
The IBBE scheme involved in ACCRE system has been
proved to be secure in [10]. The underlying IBE scheme is
a variant of the IBE scheme [3] in that the random value
in the denominator of the secret key’s exponent in the IBE
scheme [3] is replaced by the hashed value H(ID) in our
scheme. Using H as a random oracle, we can still obtain a
secure IBE scheme by manipulating the random values in
queried secret keys.
We now prove the security of ACCRE after the introduc-
tion of ﬁle conversion. Given an adversary A breaking the
ACCRE, we build an algorithm B which interacts with A
to break the security of the IBBE scheme in [10] or the IBE
scheme. As deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1, we have to respond to A’
CKReveal(S → ID) queries. To do so, we need to call the
key generation oracle of the IBBE scheme and then leverage
the output keys to run the CKGen algorithm to obtain the
requested conversion keys. If the adversary A queries a con-
version key for the challenge identity set S
(which is allowed
by the security deﬁnition), the algorithm B cannot simulate
such a key since the deﬁnition of the security of the IBBE
forbids generating a decryption key for the challenge iden-
tity set. To overcome this problem, we make B output the
correct keys with a determined probability, while outputs
random keys with the complementary probability. Then,
similar to [9], we create a table (β ∈ {0, 1}, S, ID, CK),
where β = 1 means that B outputs a correct key and β = 0
means that B outputs a random key. We also need to prove
the indistinguishability of the correct conversion keys and
random ones in A’s view.
The algorithm B ﬁrst runs the setup algorithm of the
IBBE scheme [10] to get public key P K. The algorithm B
also maintains a table (β, S, ID, CK) initialized to be empty.
Algorithm B interacts with adversary A as follows.

Phase 1. The adversary A makes the following queries:

Reveal(ID (cid:54)∈ S
). Algorithm B responds by generat-
ing a decryption key. It ﬂips a random β ∈ {0, 1} so
that Pr[β = 1] with a probability θ which we will deter-
mine later. When β = 0, or (0,∗, ID,∗) exists on the
table, where ∗ denotes the wildcard, B aborts. Oth-
erwise, B calls the key generation oracle of the IBBE
scheme by taking in ID to output a secret key for ID
and returns this key to A. Finally, algorithm B writes
(β,∗, ID,⊥) in the table.
CKReveal(S → ID). Algorithm B ﬂips a random β ∈
{0, 1} just as in the Reveal stage. If β = 1 and S (cid:54)= S
∗
,
or (1, S,∗,⊥) exists on the table, algorithm B requests
the key generation oracle of the IBBE scheme to create
a secret key with identity in S and applies this key to
the CKGen algorithm to generate a conversion key
CK from S to ID, then B gives CK to A. Otherwise,
B returns a random conversion key CK = (D, R0, R1),
where D is a random element of G and (R0, R1) can be
seen an IBE ciphertext for some message. Finally, B
writes (β, S, ID, CK) in the table.

Phase 2. Phase 1 is repeated except the forbidden queries

(cid:48) ∈ {0, 1} and
We now determine the upper-bounded probability of B in
breaking the security of the IBBE scheme [10] and the IBE
scheme. We note that B perfectly simulates the real scheme
if it does not abort and always outputs correct keys. We
ﬁrst describe the probability that B aborts. Let qK denote
the number of A’ secret key queries. Then the probability
of B aborting in phase 1 and phase 2 is θqK . Besides, the
probability that B aborts in the challenge phase is 1 − θ.
Hence, the probability that B aborts in the whole game is
θqK (1−θ), which has a maximum value 1−1/(qK +1). Using
this value, we can obtain the probability that B aborts is at
least 1/e(1 + qK ).
We next discuss the probability of A in distinguishing a
correct key from a random one. The random conversion key
R← GT , and the correct
is in the form of (D, R0, R1), where D
conversion key is in the form of (SKIDj F (k), E0, E1), where
(E0, E1) is an IBE ciphertext for k. We can see that SKIDj
is randomized by F (k). The only way to distinguish these
two keys is to distinguish (R0, R1) from (E0, E1). However,
this is equivalent to breaking the security of the IBE scheme.
Then the probability of A in distinguishing correct keys from
random keys is negligible.
The adversary’s successful distinguishability of the mes-
sage encrypted in the challenge ciphertext is identical to
breaking the security of the IBBE scheme.
Therefore, given the advantage AdvA of A breaking the
security of our scheme, the algorithm B can break the se-
curity of the IBBE scheme with an advantage 1 and the
security of the IBE scheme with an advantage 2, satisfying
1 + 2 ≥ AdvA/e(1 + qK ).
