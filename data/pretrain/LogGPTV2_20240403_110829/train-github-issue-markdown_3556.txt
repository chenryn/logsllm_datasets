It would be nice if Symfony core provide Javascript bundle to inject common
javascript library e.g. jQuery to make the standard way for common use.
My idea, If we can just include javascript library (global modular) to our
project with just config in our config file (app/config/config.yml or any
place) it will be nice for download and use public bundles from any vendors
who required same javascript library with out conflict or duplicate.
This's same composer idea and may use in this case.
