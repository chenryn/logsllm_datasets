It would be beneficial if the Symfony core provided a JavaScript bundle to inject common JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery, to establish a standardized approach for their use. Ideally, developers should be able to include global modular JavaScript libraries in their projects simply by configuring them in the `config.yml` file (or another appropriate configuration file). This would facilitate the seamless integration of public bundles from various vendors that depend on the same JavaScript libraries, thereby avoiding conflicts or duplication.

This concept aligns with the principles behind Composer and could potentially be implemented in a similar manner. For more information, you may refer to the following resource: [Jam by Caolan McMahon](https://github.com/caolan/jam).

It would be highly beneficial if the Symfony core included a JavaScript bundle to manage the injection of common JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery. This would provide a standardized method for their use across projects.

Ideally, developers should be able to include global modular JavaScript libraries in their projects by simply adding a configuration in the `config.yml` file (or another appropriate configuration file). This approach would streamline the process of integrating public bundles from various vendors that depend on the same JavaScript libraries, thereby avoiding conflicts or duplication.

This concept is similar to how Composer manages PHP dependencies and could be implemented in a comparable way. For further reference, you can explore the [Jam project by Caolan McMahon](https://github.com/caolan/jam), which provides a similar functionality for JavaScript.
