User: Please explain the concept of a RESTful API and provide an example of a web application using the REST architecture.
Assistant: RESTful API is an API design specification based on the HTTP protocol, which allows clients to access resources on the server by requesting verbs such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE under the HTTP protocol and passing parameters. These resources are usually XML and JSON data of the website, or files such as pictures and videos. The design concept of RESTful API is to simplify the communication between client and server and improve the performance and scalability of Internet applications. An example of a web application using the RESTful API architecture is Twitter. Twitter's API provides a variety of API endpoints, including resources such as users, tweets, lists, and CRUD operations on these resources. Clients can obtain, modify, and delete Twitter resources by calling different API endpoints. The data format returned by these API endpoints is usually JSON or XML.
