User: Is it possible to update an AppEngine task in the task queue?
Specifically, changing the eta property of the task to make it run at a different time?  
In my scenario, each item in my datastore has an associated task attached to it. If the element is updated, the task needs to updated with a new eta.
I currently set the name of the task explicitly as the id of the item using name=item.key().id() so that I can uniquely refer to the task.
When the task is called and deleted, the name doesn't get freed immediately (I think). This causes issues because I need to re-add the task as soon as it gets executed.
Assistant: With pull queues, you can use modify_task_lease to set the ETA relative to the current time (even if you do not currently have the task leased).
You can't change the ETA of a pull queue task.
Each task's name remains unavailable for seven days.
