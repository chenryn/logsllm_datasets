It is noticeable that Deﬁnition 3 also implies the deﬁnition
of a hybrid PRE scheme. When a PRE scheme β deﬁned by
Deﬁnition 3 is a hybrid PRE scheme, it means that the users
in scheme β can use diﬀerent auxiliary information auxβ to
generate their public keys with diﬀerent types.
Furthermore, we adaptively deﬁne the security of the new
general deﬁnition of PRE. The security is IND-CPA of PRE.
Comparing with the traditional IND-CPA deﬁnition of PRE,
the new deﬁnition additionally allows any adversary to query
public keys by issuing auxiliary information. Moreover, any
adversary must choose a queried public key as a challenge
public key that he wants to attack. The other details of the
new IND-CPA deﬁnition of PRE have the same essence with
its traditional deﬁnition.

query (cid:104)P Kβ(cid:105) to C; C retrieves record (P Kβ, SKβ)

Then challenger C generates the master public and secret
parameters by running Setupβ, generates the correspond-
ing public key for the challenge auxiliary information by
running Extractβ and sends this public key to adversary
B. This generated public key is taken as the challenge pub-
lic key that adversary B wants to attack. So in Challenge

3. THE PROPOSED GHPRE SCHEME
Taking a PKE scheme α = (Setupα, Extractα, Encα,
Decα) and a PRE scheme β = (Setupβ, Extractβ, Encβ,
Dec-1β, RKβ, ReEncβ, Dec-2β) as building blocks, the
proposed GHPRE scheme γ consists of the following seven
algorithms: (1) Algorithm Setupγ sets up the PRE scheme
β and the PKE scheme α; (2) Algorithm Extractγ generates
a pair of public and private keys of β or of α, or generates a
pair of temporary (or one-time) public and private keys of
β; (3) Algorithm Encγ generates an initial PRE ciphertext
of β; (4) Algorithm Dec-1γ decrypts an initial PRE cipher-
text of β; (5) Algorithm RKγ generates a re-encryption key
that can re-encrypt any initial PRE ciphertext of β into a
re-encrypted PRE ciphertext, and the re-encrypted PRE ci-
phertext can be decrypted by any intended private key of α;
(6) Algorithm ReEncγ re-encrypts an initial PRE cipher-
text of β; (7) Algorithm Dec-2γ decrypts a re-encrypted
PRE ciphertext generated by algorithm ReEncγ. We can
ﬁnd that algorithm Encγ generates the same ciphertext with
algorithm Encβ. It implies that the GHPRE scheme γ is
very convenient to be transparently employed while β is run-
ning in practice.
Let x ∈ {α, β} and t ∈ {0, 1} be two variants, where t will
be used to distinguish the temporary key and the users’ real
key. The GHPRE scheme γ are as follows:
• Setupγ(1k) → (MPγ, MSγ) takes a security parame-
ter 1k as input, generates (MPα, MSα) ← Setupα(1k)
and (MPβ, MSβ) ← Setupβ(1k), and initializes γ
by returning the master public and secret parameters
MPγ = (MPα, MPβ) and MSγ = (MSα, MSβ).
