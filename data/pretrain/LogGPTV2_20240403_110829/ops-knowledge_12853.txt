User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题WindowsServer 2012, Multiple users and multiple IPs We have server with 4 additional IPs. we have 4 users that use RDP to connect to the server. I'd like each user have separate IP for connecting and this IP will be showing when he'll use internet (browser etc.) on the server.

Is it possible?

Assistant: Let me give you multiple answers, I hope it is what you need:


Can I access a Windows Server via RDP through all the available IP adresses?


Yes. You can disable the connection to RDP for specific IPs in the Windows firewall, but if you enable RDP it should work by default with all IPs that are configured on the server.


Can different users access the server via RDP from different source IP addresses?


Same as above: yes, but you can block different IPs or even IP ranges for RDP access in the Windows firewall. Like above, if you enable RDP, it should work by default.


Can the RDP users use external IP addresses?


Of course. But if by external IP adresses you mean that they access the server from the internet: it is possible to configure your internet gateway to do so (open port 3389 from external addresses to the RDP server, and use port forwarding to the server if it is using non-routable IP addresses), but IMHO it is absolutly not recommended. Windows Server should not be put on the internet without additional security gateways in-between. But if all your users are sitting behind the same gateway and are using public IP addresses (had that configuration in my last job...), there is absolutly no problem with accessing the servers via RDP.


Can I see who acessed the server by using a specific server IP address?


I do not know a way doing this only with the windows server. If you have a firewall or any routing device with logging capabilities between your clients and the server, you could log the traffic between these IPs. But as far as I know the Windows log only shows you the originating IP address of the client, not the IP of the server. One way to be able to see this on the server is to run a packet tracer like Wireshark in the background with a capture filter only logging RDP related events.
