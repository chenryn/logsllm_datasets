User: How to achieve concurrent sharing of a shared data volume between containers in the Kubernetes cluster to avoid data read and write conflicts?
Assistant: Shared storage volumes can be used in a Kubernetes cluster for concurrent sharing between containers. Common shared storage volumes include NFS, GlusterFS, and Ceph. When in use, it is necessary to ensure that each container can access the shared storage volume, and the read and write operations on the shared data volume need to avoid concurrency conflicts, which can be achieved by using the file lock mechanism or database transactions. At the same time, data needs to be backed up and restored to avoid data loss.
