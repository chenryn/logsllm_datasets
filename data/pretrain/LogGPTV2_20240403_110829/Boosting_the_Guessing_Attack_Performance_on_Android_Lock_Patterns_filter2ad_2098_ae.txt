C. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP FOR CAMERA
AND LIGHTNING
For smudge attacks to work best, we carefully tested several
camera and lighting conditions. The target device was placed in
front of that camera attached to a paperboard (see Figure 19), and
the angle between the camera lens and touchscreen was set to 30
○.
D. EXPERIMENT RESULTS FOR DETER-
MINING THRESHOLD VALUES IN THE
SEGMENT DECISION PROCEDURE
We associated “existing segments” with positive answers (P )
and “non-existing segments” with negative answers (N). The def-
inition of true positive (T P ), false positive (F P ), true negative
(T N), and false negative (F N) can be summarized as follows:
● T P : “existing segments” correctly classiﬁed as “existing seg-
ments”;
Figure 19: To take a picture needed for smug attack, a smart-
phone was placed under a bright light source, and in front of a
high-resolution camera.
● F P : “non-existing segments” incorrectly classiﬁed as “exist-
● T N: “non-existing segments” correctly classiﬁed as “non-

ing segments”;
segments”.
To evaluate the performance of the segment decision procedure
with varying threshold values, we used the following four mea-
the proportion of correctly classiﬁed segments;
sures:● Accuracy:
(T P+ T N)~(P+ N)
● Precision: the proportion of segments classiﬁed as “existing
segments” that actually are “existing segments”;(T P)~(T P+
F P)
● Recall: the proportion of “existing segments” that were accu-
rately classiﬁed;(T P)~(T P+ F N)
● F-measure: the harmonic mean of precision and recall;(2∗
P recision∗ Recall)~(P recision+ Recall)

E. FISHER’S EXACT TEST RESULTS FOR
FALSE POSITIVE AND FALSE NEGA-
TIVE ANALYSIS
We performed the Fisher’s Exact Test to identify rate differences
between pattern segments that are statistically signiﬁcant (see Ta-
ble 4). Table 4 shows the test results where signiﬁcantly different
cases are represented in bold font. “FP segment” denotes a non-
existing segment that is identiﬁed more frequently as an existing
segment in one of the three additional tasks compared to the device
unlocking task. “FN segment” denotes an existing segment that is
identiﬁed more frequently as a non-existing segment in one of the
three additional tasks compared to the device unlocking task.
Table 4: Fisher’s Exact Test results for the comparison of the
false positive and negative rates between unlocking screen and
each of post tasks (calling, messaging or using Facebook). If
p-value≤ 0.05, we use a bold font to represent its signiﬁcance.
through Private Notes. Instead of using GT-2 (which is what we
used in the optimized smug attack), we used the 3-gram Markov
model with the Laplace smoothing technique to compute occur-
rence probabilities of all possible patterns, which overall produced
the best results in the case of pure Markov model-based guessing
attack. The top 20 most popularly used Android lock patterns are
shown in Figure 21, and here are some interesting observations:
Short length. Except for the 3rd, 17th and 18th patterns, the
lengths of all other patterns are less than or equal to 5.
Small number of turns. Except for the 15th, 18th and 19th
patterns, all other patterns have just one or two turns in them.
No crossing points. All of those patterns have no crossing points.
Popular directions. Except for the 20th pattern, the rest of all
patterns start from the left side of the grid and move to the right
side. Also, all of them start from the top of the grid and move to the
bottom. We believe that those characteristics are strongly related to
the directions in which many written languages are interpreted—
we looked at the country information of the users of Private Notes
available on Google Play to conﬁrm this. Such trends indicate that
information about users’ geographical location and language may
provide useful guessing hints for adversaries.

Based on those characteristics, we surmise that many users pre-
fer using simple patterns with small number of turns that can be
drawn quickly. Such user patterns would be susceptible to smudge
attacks, shoulder-surﬁng attacks, and guessing attacks.
