Question: You are encrypting a message that ends with the binary sequence `1011100` using a block cipher with a block size of 128 bits. You decide to use CBC mode for encryption. To ensure integrity and proper decryption, you need to pad the message to make it a multiple of the block size. According to best practices for padding in CBC mode, how should you pad the end of this message?
"A": "Pad the message with zeros until it reaches 128 bits in total length.",
"B": "Pad the message with a sequence of bits that corresponds to the number of padding bits needed.",
"C": "Append a new block of 128 bits that contains a pattern unique to the padding process.",
"D": "No padding is necessary; proceed with encryption using only the provided binary sequence."
Answer: B
