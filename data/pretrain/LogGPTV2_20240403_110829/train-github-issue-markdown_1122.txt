hi,  
here is my site  
richer-poorer.com/devsite.  
its in magento. magento use prototype.js file. but with that file included my
reponsive menu only work one time. after that clicking on collapse button does
nothing.  
I cant remove the prototype.js because that causes magento to stop.  
Can anyone help about it?  
I have tried both (Placing jquery file before prototype as well as in the
footer) but result is same.
