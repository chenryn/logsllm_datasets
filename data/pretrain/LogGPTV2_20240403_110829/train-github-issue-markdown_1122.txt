Hello,

I'm reaching out for assistance with an issue on my Magento site, [richer-poorer.com/devsite](http://richer-poorer.com/devsite).

The problem I'm encountering is related to the responsive menu. Specifically, the menu only functions correctly the first time it is used. After that, clicking the collapse button does not produce any response.

Magento relies on the `prototype.js` file, and I cannot remove it as doing so causes the site to malfunction. I have attempted to place the jQuery file both before the `prototype.js` file and in the footer, but the result remains the same.

Could anyone provide some guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you,
[Your Name]
