### Different Parameters and Setup

External threats primarily arise from the selection of malware samples for FODA (Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis). Currently, our FODA malware samples are sourced exclusively from the GENOME project. Given that GENOME originated in 2010, it may contain a significant number of outdated malware samples. To ensure the relevance and timeliness of our malware dataset, we need to investigate the malicious behaviors present in other contemporary malware collections. Another threat stems from the public availability of AMTs (Anti-Malware Tools) that we can audit. Specifically, for tools based on dynamic analysis, access to the source code is essential for effective debugging and testing. At present, we only have the source code for TAINTDROID. In the future, we plan to audit additional AMTs that rely on dynamic analysis.

### Countermeasures for Generated Malware

Based on our experiments with generated malicious apps and the detection results from AMTs, we propose three key recommendations for future research in Android malware detection:

1. **Refined Source & Sink Pattern:**
   - The identification of sources and sinks is a fundamental step for both static and dynamic analysis tools. These tools track the flow of information from sources through the program or runtime environment. However, most existing works [8, 20, 27, 34] identify sources and sinks by matching them with Android APIs, such as SUSI [40]. This approach has limitations, as some sources cannot be represented by APIs. For example, the number of incoming calls can be obtained via `PhoneStateListener.onCallStateChanged`, and malware can use `toString` to fetch specific latitude and longitude data, bypassing AMT tracking. A more refined pattern for sources and sinks would enhance the detection of privacy leaks.

2. **Comprehensive Consideration of Communication Channels:**
   - Android provides multiple communication channels, including Intents, system memory, and persistent storage. Additionally, side-channel attacks have emerged in the Android ecosystem [15]. These advanced techniques complicate malware detection. Therefore, modern detection methods must stay abreast of these evolving attack vectors and continuously update their domain knowledge.

3. **Correct Understanding of Malicious Behaviors:**
   - Current machine learning-based approaches often lack a deep understanding of the core malicious behaviors. Features extracted from apps are often disjointed or not directly related to malicious activities. Although machine learning tools achieve high accuracy in training (91.4%), they perform poorly in detecting generated malware in real-world scenarios (less than 9.5%, § 7.3). By integrating static analysis to extract relationships between different features, machine learning approaches can improve their performance, even at the cost of some efficiency [25, 51, 52].

### Related Work

#### Android Malware Generation
- Aydogan and Sen [10] proposed using a genetic algorithm to generate Android malware. The new malware variants, derived from the crossover and mutation of malware in GENOME [55], were shown to evade anti-virus detection.
- Cani et al. [12] used µGP to automatically create undetectable malware and inject it into benign apps to form Trojan horses.

#### Malware Evasion Techniques
- Christodorescu et al. [16] provided a formal definition for obfuscation, which hackers can use to modify malware to evade detection. Petsas et al. [39] introduced heuristics to detect if malware is running on an emulated or real device, thereby deciding whether to execute malicious behavior. These heuristics include static (e.g., IMEI code, routing table), dynamic (e.g., sensor data), and hypervisor (e.g., QEMU scheduling) checks.

#### Anti-malware Auditing
- Christodorescu and Jha [16] tested commercial anti-virus tools using four types of obfuscation techniques and proposed an algorithm to extract unique signatures for malware identification.
- ADAM [53] is an automated platform for testing and auditing Android anti-virus tools, employing transformation techniques to generate polymorphic malware and test various anti-virus tools.
- DROIDCHAMELEON [41, 42] collected three types of transformation attacks in Android and used them to audit off-the-shelf detection tools.
- Huang et al. [29] evaluated the detection capabilities of 30 top anti-virus tools, focusing on malware scanning and engine updating, revealing evasion hazards and null-protection windows during updates.

### Conclusion

We propose a feature model to describe malware behaviors for better understanding and detection. MYSTIQUE, our Android malware generation framework, automatically generates malware with specific features. The generated malware is used to explore the aggressiveness of attack features and the effectiveness of evasion techniques. We provide 10,000 generated malicious apps to evaluate emerging AMTs and enhance the security of the Android ecosystem.
