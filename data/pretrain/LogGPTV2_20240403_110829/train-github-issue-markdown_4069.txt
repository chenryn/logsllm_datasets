### Issue Type
- Bug Report

### Component Name
- Ansible Main Program

### Ansible Version
When attempting to check the version, I encountered the following error:
```bash
root@docker-build-test:/mnt/src/ansible/ansible/bin# ./ansible --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./ansible", line 46, in <module>
    from ansible.module_utils._text import to_text
ImportError: No module named _text
```

### Configuration
- Building `ansible` from source.
- A system-installed `ansible` version 2.0.0.2 is present, installed via Ubuntu 16.04 for aarch64.

### Operating System / Environment
- Ubuntu 16.04 on ARMv8 (aarch64)
- Running on a 96-core server hosted on Packet.net

### Summary
After installing several test dependencies and successfully passing all tests, I encountered an issue when trying to run `ansible --version` from the `bin/` directory of the distribution. The command fails with an `ImportError` indicating that the `_text` module cannot be found. A similar, but not identical, issue is documented as #18582.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the current distribution from the GitHub repository, specifically the `devel` branch.
2. Verify the branch is up-to-date with the remote `origin/devel`.
   ```bash
   # git status
   On branch devel
   Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/devel'.
   ```

### Expected Results
I expected the `ansible --version` command to print the version number.

### Actual Results
The command fails with the following traceback:
```bash
root@docker-build-test:/mnt/src/ansible/ansible/bin# ./ansible -vvvv --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./ansible", line 46, in <module>
    from ansible.module_utils._text import to_text
ImportError: No module named _text
```

### Additional Notes
- This issue may be related to the build process or the environment configuration.
- Further investigation is needed to determine if this is a local setup issue or a broader problem with the `devel` branch.
