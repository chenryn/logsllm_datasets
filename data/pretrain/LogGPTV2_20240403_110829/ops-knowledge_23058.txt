User: I have to open a system file and read from it. This file is usually only readable by root (the super user). I have a way to ask the user for the superuser password. I would like to use this credentials to open the file and read from it without having my entire program running as a superuser process. Is there a way to achieve this in a multiplatform way?
Assistant: What you're looking for is called privilege escalation, and it very much depends on the platform you're running on. In general, what your program would have to do is run a portion as the superuser. On unix systems, for instance, you might be able to use sudo to read the contents of the file. 
But as mentioned, this really depends on what system you're running on.
