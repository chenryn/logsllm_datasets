User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题error: Failed to initialize NSS library I am getting error when installing updates or patches in RHEL-7.7.3..

error: Failed to initialize NSS library

There was a problem importing one of the Python modules

required to run yum. The error leading to this problem was:

 

   cannot import name ts

 

Please install a package which provides this module, or

verify that the module is installed correctly.

 

It's possible that the above module doesn't match the

current version of Python, which is:

2.7.5 (default, Aug  2 2016, 04:20:16)

[GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4)]

 

If you cannot solve this problem yourself, please go to

the yum faq at:

  http://yum.baseurl.org/wiki/Faq

HOW can I resolve it?

Assistant: If you're like me, trying to save a server buckled under as-usual-unnecessary package-management force, from a rescue/chroot environment,
— be sure to bind-mount a valid /dev filesystem inside the chroot.
For, as strace -f rpm --help shows, it needs a /dev/urandom.

Enlightenment props go to  this GitHub issue which highlighted the /dev/urandom thing which I definitely seen near ENOENT in strace log, but somehow didn't pay attention to. I've bind-mounted /{proc,sys} as well, for good measure. The issue went away; server rescued, yay!
