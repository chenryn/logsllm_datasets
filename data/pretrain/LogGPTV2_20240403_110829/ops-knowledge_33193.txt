User: Not sure what the above error means.  I just installed ghmm on my mac and get this error every time I do a import ghmm.  I do not get this message on my ghmm install on my linux machine and other than that all functions appear to be fine.
I wondering if anyone has seen this before and if there's anything I can do to get rid of this.  The only thing I did different between the two installs was the autogen.sh file was refering to "libtoolize" which doesn't exist on my mac so I changed it to its replacement "glibtoolize" which allowed it to compile and install fine.
Any suggestions on what this error actually means(and hopefully how I can solve it) would be great.
(I couldn't find the answer on google but this program does not appear to be specific to ghmm)
Assistant: eaj is correct that initstate needs more than 8 bytes for state information. The best way to do this for ghmm is with either the --enable-gsl or --with-rng=bsd option for ./configure. --with-rng=bsd makes the type "ghmm_rng_state_t" 8 bytes instead of 1. See rng.h in the ghmm directory.
