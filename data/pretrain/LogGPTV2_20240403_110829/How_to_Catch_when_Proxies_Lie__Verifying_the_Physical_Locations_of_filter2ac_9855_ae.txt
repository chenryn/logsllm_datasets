which practically guarantees they are on the same local network.
It would be valuable to have a measurement tool that is as user-
friendly as the existing Web-based tool, but as accurate as the
command-line tool. The Web-based tool could reliably record the
time for a single round-trip, and perhaps also avoid some of the
Windows-specific overhead and noise, if it could use the W3C
Navigation Timing API [1]. This API gives Web applications access
to detailed information about the time taken for each stage of an
HTTP query-response pair. Unfortunately, it can only be used if
each server involved allows it, and currently none of the RIPE Atlas
anchors and probes do. We plan to discuss the possibility with
the RIPE team. Of course, as we mentioned above, the fact that
active geolocation from a Web application is possible at all arguably
constitutes a privacy leak in Web browsers, and we also plan to
discuss that with the browser vendors.
RIPE Atlas anchors tend to be on subnetworks with more stable,
less congested connectivity to the global backbone than is typical
for their locale. That could mean each anchor’s CBG++ bestline, cali-
brated from measurements of round-trip times to the other anchors,
215
overestimates the distance packets can typically travel from that an-
chor. Overestimation leads only to greater uncertainty in predicted
locations, whereas underestimation leads to failure (as discussed in
Section 5.1). Still, this is a source of error that should be quantified.
We are considering adding other measurement constellations, such
as the CAIDA Archipelago [6] and PlanetLab [37], to our landmark
set. This would allow us to compare the delay-distance relation-
ships observed across constellations to those observed within a
single constellation, and thus investigate the degree of overestima-
tion. Additional constellations would also improve our landmark
coverage outside Europe and North America. All of the above are
also concentrated in the “developed world,” but in sparse networks,
each new landmark helps a great deal [16].

A UNCERTAINTY AND CONTINENTS
Uncertain prediction regions include more than one country, or
even more than one continent. Since a prediction region is always
contiguous, we expect uncertainty among groups of neighboring
countries, but which groups? We briefly examine this question with
a pair of confusion matrices, one for continents and the other for
of countries. All data is for the proxies, not the crowdsourced test
hosts.

IMC ’18, October 31–November 2, 2018, Boston, MA, USA
Figure 23: Confusion matrix among countries. Blue tinting marks groups of countries on the same continent.
The lines separating continents are somewhat arbitrary. For this
analysis, we chose to include Mexico with Central America, Turkey
and Russia with Europe, all of the Middle East with Africa, and all
of Malaysia and New Zealand with Oceania.
Intercontinental uncertainty is as one would expect: Europe/
Africa/Asia, Asia/Oceania/Australia, North/Central and to a lesser
extent South America. The country matrix, however, reveals that
just about every country within a continent can share a predic-
tion region; the exceptions are more interesting. Many southern
African countries seem more likely to be confused with Asia than
their neighbors, and not just the Indian subcontinent, but all the
way to Japan. Similar effects appear for Oceania. This may reflect
neighboring countries or islands in these areas not being connected
directly, only through a more developed hub.
