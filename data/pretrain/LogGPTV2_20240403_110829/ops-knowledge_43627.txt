**User:**
I need to know, when I run my Python script from the terminal, how many modules are loaded by default, which I do not have to import to use? Which modules can I directly use?

My system environment is Ubuntu 11.04.

**Assistant:**
When you run a Python script from the terminal, certain built-in functions and types are available without needing to import them. These include basic data types like `int`, `str`, `list`, and `dict`, as well as fundamental functions such as `print()`, `len()`, and `type()`.

However, most of the modules in the Python Standard Library, such as `os`, `sys`, `math`, and `datetime`, must be explicitly imported before they can be used. For example, you would need to import the `os` module with `import os` before you can use its functions.

To see a list of all the built-in functions and types that are available without importing, you can refer to the `builtins` module. You can print all the names in the `builtins` module using the following code:

```python
import builtins
print(dir(builtins))
```

This will give you a comprehensive list of what is available by default.

If you are specifically interested in the modules that come with the standard library, you can find a complete list in the official Python documentation for your specific version of Python. For Python 2.7 (which is the version typically included with Ubuntu 11.04), you can refer to the [Python 2.7 Standard Library documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/).
