EFI Performance tuning: Air
• Superchargers and 
Turbochargers
– Create “boost”
– Increase cylinder 
pressure
– Increase heat
• Boost is a volume knob
– Huge Garrett GT4202  
– 800+ whp
Continued on next page…
EFI Performance tuning: Air
• More boost More problems
– Boost pressurizes more air in the 
cylinders.  The ECU needs to toss 
more fuel into the mixture.
– Fuel injectors, fuel pumps, and 
motors all have physical 
limitations
• More vigilant maintenance
– Most car owners aren't 
responsible enough to care for 
boosted motors

EFI Performance tuning: KNOCK
• More boost More problems…
• Knock is when the air fuel mixture ignites 
without the ECU firing the spark plug
– Knock occurs when temperature and cylinder 
pressures are too high causing the mix to ignite   
without spark
– AKA “ping”
“detonation”

• An ECU listens to knock 
sensors attached to the 
engine
• If it detects knock, it will 
switch to different 
settings
– Ex. Richer fuel, less 
timing advance

• Because auto manufactures play it safe, the 
ECU can be remapped to make more power
– Especially if you help the engine in other ways 
ward off knock
• This also helps take full advantage of 
aftermarket parts because factory ECU   
parts will only up the performance to a 
certain point
– Ex. A larger exhaust

Fixing knock with octane
• Octane and other tricks for coping with knock
– Reduce cylinder temperatures
• A richer AFR can cool the cylinder charge
• Cool boosted air 
– Intercoolers
– Decrease cylinder pressure
• Less ignition advance
– Increase fuel octane
A direct quote from Stone (p. 80): "The attraction of high octane 
fuels is that they enable high compression ratios to be 
used.
Higher compression ratios give increased power output and 
improved economy [assuming the same power of engine] ... The 
octane number requirements for a given compression ratio vary 
widely, but typically a compression ratio of 7.5 requires 85 octane 
fuel, while a compression ratio of 10.0 requires 100 octane fuel.
Continued on next page…
Fixing knock with octane
• This is why most re‐flashed cars and trucks 
require premium grade fuels
• The higher compression ratio is also why 
turbocharged and supercharged motors 
require premium octane
– Higher octane fuels lets you 
get away with 
running more boost and more ignition advance 
making more power

Super Duper Hi‐Tech stuff
• What if you live in one of unfortunate states 
that passes off 91 octane as premium fuel?
• Mix in some E85 
– 100 octane
• Water injection
– WWII Fighter planes
– Cools combustion 
– 50/50 Methanol  H20

Some final thoughts
• The green movement
• Fuel economy legislation
– Don’t forget about those 
of us who enjoy driving
• The ECU will play a big 
role in enforcing fuel 
economy
• How about a law that 
forces everybody to drive 
40 MPH to conserve fuel?
