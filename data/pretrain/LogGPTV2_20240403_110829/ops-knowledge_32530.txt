User: Please introduce the concept of distributed systems, and common problems and solutions in distributed architectures.
Assistant: distributed system is a computer system composed of multiple computers and multiple communication devices, which are connected to each other through a network to work together to achieve a common task. Distributed systems are designed to improve system reliability, scalability, and performance. Common problems in distributed architectures include: 1. Data consistency: Since there may be communication failures or transmission delays in different parts of the distributed system, even if data has been updated synchronously between multiple nodes, data between different nodes may Still inconsistent. In order to ensure data consistency, it is necessary to adopt corresponding consistency protocols, such as Paxos, Raft, ZAB, etc. 2. Load balancing: For high-concurrency application systems, requests need to be distributed to multiple servers to balance the load. Common load balancing strategies include round robin, least number of connections (Least Connections), etc. 3. Fault tolerance: There may be problems such as node downtime or network failure in the distributed system. In order to ensure the availability of the system, it is necessary to adopt relevant fault tolerance strategies, such as backup, fault tolerance mechanism, retry mechanism, etc. 4. Security: Distributed systems need to ensure data security and privacy. In order to ensure security, technologies such as access control, identity authentication, data encryption, and firewalls need to be adopted. Common solutions include: 1. Distributed cache: For high-concurrency application systems, build a distributed cache to reduce the load on the database and improve the read and write performance of the system. 2. Service registration discovery: By building a service registration discovery mechanism, micro-service governance, service configuration, and service discovery of distributed systems can be realized. 3. Distributed transaction: By adopting a distributed transaction mechanism, the data consistency of the distributed system can be guaranteed, such as XA, TCC, local message table, etc. 4. Container technology: By adopting container technology (such as Docker), various service components in distributed systems can be quickly built, deployed, expanded and managed.
