Question: You are reviewing the security of an OAuth Authorization Server implementation. You notice that during the OAuth flow, the AS does not properly validate the `redirect_uri` parameter. Which of the following implications can this have for the security of the application?
"A": "Allows the AS to grant clients access to resources without user consent.",
"B": "Could lead to tricking the AS into sending an authorization code to an attacker-controlled server.",
"C": "The AS can mistakenly issue refresh tokens instead of authorization codes.",
"D": "Enhances the security by adding randomness to the redirect process."
Answer: B
