User: I have a python application which I cant edit its a black box from my point of view. The python application knows how to process text and return processed text.
I have another application written in Java which knows how to collect non processed texts.
Current state, the python app works in batch mode every x minutes.
I want to make the python 
processing part of the process: Java app collects text and request the python app to process and return processed text as part of a flow.
What do you think is the simplest solution for this?
Thanks,
Rod
Assistant: Expose one of the two as a service of some kind, web service maybe. Another option is to port the python code to Jython
