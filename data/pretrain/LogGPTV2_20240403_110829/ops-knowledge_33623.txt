**User:**

I am planning to start a mid-sized web project and would appreciate recommendations on the best language and framework to use. I am proficient in Java and Python and am looking for a solution that is relatively simple to implement.

Is Google App Engine (GAE) a good option? I am drawn to its overall simplicity and free hosting, but I have some concerns:
- How difficult is it to achieve performance comparable to a standard SQL solution with the GAE datastore?
- Does GAE support full-text search?
- Can I filter objects by multiple parameters effectively?

What are your thoughts on using Java with the Stripes framework? Should I consider an additional framework for database management?

**Update:**

Thank you for your advice. After careful consideration, I have decided to use Django with Eclipse/PyDev as my IDE. Python and Django offer a simple and elegant solution, are widely used, and come with excellent documentation. The only minor drawback is that I may need to purchase a VPS, but I believe it should be straightforward to migrate the project to Google App Engine if needed, which offers a certain level of free hosting.

**Assistant:**

I have developed several applications on Google App Engine using Python over the past year. One of the key advantages of GAE is the ease with which you can get an application up and running quickly. This alone is a significant benefit.

While you may not be fully familiar with the GAE datastore yet, it is extremely well-documented, and there are numerous resources available to help you overcome any challenges. The community and official documentation are both very supportive, making it easier to navigate and optimize your application's performance.
