and cluster malicious domain names, thus their accuracy will
be impacted as well (e.g., malicious and benign domains could
be clustered when their WHOIS records are redacted together
by a provider).
Based on Observation 1, the systems developed under those
papers have to be re-engineered as the majority of WHOIS
providers now follow the GDPR. In addition, as most non-EEA
domains are redacted as well (per Observation 5), the impact
could be escalated. For attackers exploiting domain registration
systems, escaping the detection and tracing becomes much
easier, even when they are not EEA citizens.
B. Remediation
The ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation proposes a tiered-
access framework to be enabled by registrars and registries,
in order to allow the usage of WHOIS data under legitimate
purposes (e.g., law enforcement and commercial litigation).
We ﬁnd that some providers have already implemented such
systems (e.g., https://tieredaccess.com by Tucows).
However, a recent survey [25] has shown that the issue of data
visibility has not been addressed: over 70% access requests
have been denied by WHOIS providers under reasons like no
court order is shown. The IETF proposed Registration Data
Access Protocol (RDAP) [77] to replace the WHOIS protocol
in the future, and it is designed to allow speciﬁcally authorized
people to access private registration data. However, we have
not found instructions or links about the authorization process
in the existing systems.
In the long term, we believe deploying the tiered-access
framework and RDAP is still the right direction, though their
operational model should be better designed (e.g., the hurdle
to security researchers should be minimized). In the short
term, we suggest ICANN reﬁne the requirements listed in the
Temporary Speciﬁcation and suggest a data redaction policy
that can balance data utility and privacy. As one example,
registration information (including name, email address and
street) is very useful for domain clustering. Currently, these
ﬁelds are usually replaced by ﬁxed values, such as “redacted
for privacy” or empty values, making domain clustering less
effective. To address this issue, the use of fuzzy hashing [32]
could be suggested, which tells the distance between two ﬁelds
without revealing their original values.
VII. DISCUSSION
Overall, our measurement results show that the GDPR’s
impact on the Internet domain community is substantial:
most WHOIS providers actively redact WHOIS records for
compliance. On the other hand, we also ﬁnd a non-negligible
number of partially- or non-compliant providers, with some of
them making mistakes during data redaction. Below we list
a few recommendations to different stakeholders in hopes of
better compliance under the GDPR.
Recommendations. Based on our discussion with registrars,
the 1-week window between the ICANN Temporary Speci-
ﬁcation and GDPR effective date is too short, which leads
to excessive data redaction for non-EEA domains. A more
efﬁcient format for the discussion between legal authorities and
technical communities should be adopted to leave more time
for policy execution. This could beneﬁt the stakeholders when
new privacy policies like the CCPA are enforced. Secondly,
though the language of the ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation
leaves room for how to redact data, it turns out more confusion
is created among WHOIS providers. Implementation ﬂaws
have been identiﬁed for data redaction. Additionally, as the
document
leaves ﬂexibility for the data protection scope,
some registrars are uncertain about what domains should be
protected and therefore sanitize every WHOIS record, though
ICANN’s intention is to limit the changes to EEA domains
only (drawn from our discussions with ICANN staff). We
suggest that ICANN make more speciﬁc instructions, attach
a best practice guidance for technical operators and provide
tools for compliance checking instead of relying on complaint
reports.
For WHOIS providers, we recommend them to revisit their
redaction process and ﬁx errors, e.g., only masking a portion
of the registrant’s ﬁelds. Tools need to be developed to enable
periodical inspection and automated error ﬁxing. Auxiliary
systems for email forwarding or tiered WHOIS access should
be deployed by every provider to ensure legitimate requests
(e.g., messages from security researchers) can be fulﬁlled.
Finally, we also call attention from security researchers and
companies who leverage WHOIS data to build applications like
malicious domain detection. These applications need to be re-
assessed or adjusted (e.g., retraining the detection model by
removing the redacted ﬁelds) to maintain the same level of
effectiveness. Alternatively, researchers could push regulators
for restricted API access (to accessing data and automati-
cally sending notiﬁcations to registrants) and cooperate with
large domain registrars for a more uniformed data redaction
approach, which balances privacy protection and research
needs. An example could be the adoption of fuzzy hashing
on the protected ﬁelds, instead of using the same redaction
string. Moreover, security researchers could also evaluate the
inﬂuence of different redaction methods.
Online checking tool. To help WHOIS providers gain a
clearer view of their current GDPR compliance status of
WHOIS data, we design and release an online checking tool (at
https://whoisgdprcompliance.info). A user repre-
senting the provider can view the weekly outlier ratio and a
sample of outlying domain names under his/her organization
after identity veriﬁcation. From our discussions with large
registrars and ICANN staff, they have shown interest in using
the tool.
VIII. RELATED WORK
Works have been published to understand real-world im-
pact of the GDPR. Previous studies focused on web privacy
and usable security, as well as compliance checking.
GDPR and web privacy. The expanded territorial scope of the
GDPR has pushed many websites to adjust their web privacy
policies. By monitoring popular websites of the EU member
states and inspecting webpages, [42] reported that many web-
sites have deployed new privacy policies and displayed cookie
consent notices. Different types of cookie notices were found
to be displayed to visitors according to their country [39].
Recent works measured the impact of the GDPR on the online
tracking ecosystem [55], [96] and advertising business [103],
[102]. Some of our ﬁndings echo with the discoveries on the
web, e.g., timely response to the GDPR.
GDPR and usable security. Cookie consent notices become
prevalent due to GDPR enforcement and users are required
to take actions (e.g., click “Accept Cookies” button) for ac-
knowledgment. How people interact with the notices depends
on their implementations, but problematic designs have been
identiﬁed [104]. When ﬁlled with deceptive and misleading
language, the consents can be misinterpreted by users [78],
[79]. While opt-out options are provided, the practical imple-
mentation of web cookies makes it difﬁcult for users to avoid
being tracked [90], [50], [49], [27], and some even conﬂict with
the regulations (e.g., mark acceptance even when an explicit
opt-out is received from the user) [72]. Overall, these ﬁndings
call for clearer guidelines for consent notices.
GDPR compliance check. Based on semantic analysis,
[80]
proposed a framework to analyze legal documents for GDPR
compliance and detect violations of privacy norms. Similarly,
[45] leveraged knowledge graph to generate rules and regula-
tions mandated for cloud data providers and customers. Au-
tomated approaches such as those based on machine learning
were proposed to analyze privacy documents [24], [35], [91].
For example, [35] extracted privacy policies based on users’
in-context privacy concerns.
GDPR-compliant system design. Some recent works start to
rethink the system design in the era of the GDPR or measure
the cost of compliance. [92] showed that the performance of a
GDPR-compliant database will scale poorly as the volume of
personal data increases. Frictions between cloud-scale systems
and the GDPR has also been discussed [93]. Those works show
building clean-slate GDPR-compliant systems is non-trivial.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we report the ﬁrst systematic and large-
scale measurement study on the GDPR compliance process
of domain WHOIS data providers,
in order to understand
the compliance timeline, implementation ﬂaws, scope of pro-
tection and collateral damage on security applications. We
highlight that the enforcement of the GDPR has brought a
profound impact on domain WHOIS services, and identify
various ﬂawed implementations of GDPR compliance. We also
show that the scope of privacy protection is usually excessive
in practice, causing a global impact on the WHOIS system.
To quantify the impact on academic research, we conduct a
survey study on security papers and ﬁnd 69% surveyed papers
need to use redacted WHOIS information. The results call for
a review of current data redaction strategies, and we release
an online checking tool to help the stakeholders gain a better
view of the compliance status.
