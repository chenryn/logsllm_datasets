ATT&CK ID:S0180
ATT&CK Technique Name:Volgmer
Volgmer installs a copy of itself in a randomly selected service, then overwrites the ServiceDLL entry in the service's Registry entry. Some Volgmer variants also install .dll files as services with names generated by a list of hard-coded strings.[130][131][132]
