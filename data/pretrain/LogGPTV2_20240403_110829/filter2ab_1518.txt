**Title: BlackHat Asia-20: Patching Loopholes: Discovering Backdoors in Applications**

In the digital age, applications play a crucial role in our daily lives, enabling us to perform a wide range of tasks, from everyday activities to the storage of sensitive data. However, the security of these applications is a critical concern. As the cybersecurity lead for the Singapore Government, GovTech is committed to securing government applications through proactive security assessments.

Given the diverse and expansive application landscape, we employ a variety of techniques to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. These methods include fuzzing, source code reviews, and reverse engineering, which help us uncover new and existing security flaws.

In this presentation, we will delve into the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used to detect backdoors that developers may have inadvertently or intentionally introduced into two specific applications: a Windows-based thick client and an iOS application. These backdoors, often unknown to users, pose significant risks to the security and integrity of the applications and the data they handle.
