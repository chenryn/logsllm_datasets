ABSTRACT
We study the problem of how to share the cost of a backbone
network among its customers. A variety of empirical cost-
sharing policies are used in practice by backbone network
operators but very little ever reaches the research literature
about their properties. Motivated by this, we present a sys-
tematic study of such policies focusing on the discrepancies
between their cost allocations. We aim at quantifying how
the selection of a particular policy biases an operator’s un-
derstanding of cost generation.
We identify F-discrepancies due to the speciﬁc function
used to map traﬃc into cost (e.g., volume vs. peak rate vs.
95-percentile) and M-discrepancies, which have to do with
where traﬃc ismetered (per device vs.
ingress metering).
We also identify L-discrepancies relating to the liability of
individual customers for triggered upgrades and consequent
costs (full vs. proportional), and ﬁnally, TCO-discrepancies
emanating from the fact that the cost of carrying a bit is not
uniform across the network (old vs. new equipment, high vs.
low energy or real estate costs, etc.).
Using extensive traﬃc, routing, and cost data from a tier-1
network we show that F-discrepancies are large when looking
at individual links but cancel out when considering network-
wide cost-sharing. Metering at ingress points is convenient
but leads to large M-discrepancies, while TCO-discrepancies
are huge. Finally, L-discrepancies are intriguing and esoteric
but understanding them is central to determining the cost a
customer inﬂicts on the network.

INTRODUCTION
After several years of growth during which Internet Ser-
vice Providers (ISPs) have enjoyed healthy proﬁt margins,
we are entering a new era in which margins are progressively
declining. This is due to intense competition that pushes
prices down, while at the same time traﬃc increases faster
than the ability of technology to reduce capital (CAPEX)
and operational (OPEX) expenses. The viability of an ISP
in such a competitive ecosystem will largely depend on its
ability to understand and manage its costs.
Understanding and optimizing the total cost of ownership
(TCO) of a network, i.e. both CAPEX and OPEX, is an
important aspect of network operations and therefore it has
received substantial attention from procurement, network
development, and network planning departments of large
telcos [23]. However, the impact of individual customers
on the cost of the network, which in the case of backbone
networks are other (smaller) networks and big enterprises, is
much less understood. There are multiple reasons for this,
including the diﬃculties of monitoring usage statistics for
each customer at each device, variable per device TCO, and
non-linearities of cost-capacity functions. There is also the
issue of which customer’s additional traﬃc demand forces
the operator to upgrade his network in order to maintain
the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for all customers, that
is, which customer is liable for a triggered upgrade and to
what extent.
Overcoming such challenges and quantifying in detail how
individual customers aﬀect the TCO of a network is crucial
and can be used for provisioning and operations purposes,
including routing and peering. It can also be used for creat-
ing better tariﬀ schemes, e.g., to give discounts to customers
inﬂicting low costs or justify premiums in the opposite case.
Tariﬀs are also inﬂuenced by additional factors including
regulation, competition, and demand, and thus their rela-
tionship to cost is not necessarily directly proportional. In
this paper we analyze a wide range of cost-sharing policies
used in practice by backbone operators and contrast their
outcome using extensive input data from a tier-1 backbone
network, including 590 ingress interfaces to large customers,
691 main backbone links, and 71 core routers spread over 3
continents. Our main objective is to see how the selection
of a certain cost-sharing policy impacts the picture that an
operator has about which customers generate high costs.
Our main contributions are:

ments such as a backbone network. 1

priate parameterization.
• We analyze multiple cost-sharing policies of varying
complexity and accuracy under various settings. Our
analysis reveals large discrepancies among diﬀerent
policies when splitting the cost of an individual
network element among the customers that use it:
in 20% of cases the ratio of costs associated by two
diﬀerent policies is under 0.5 or over 2. This in turn
implies that operators must be careful
in selecting
among diﬀerent policies since their cost-allocation
outcomes may vary widely for individual devices or
small networks.

case, individual discrepancies at the device level cancel
out as one sums them up across a network. This in
turn points to an opportunity for selecting cost-sharing
policies from the least complicated side of the spectrum
without risking much sacriﬁce in terms of accuracy.
• Metering only at ingress links (which is the de-facto
norm in monitoring the customer’s usage) may greatly
under- or over-estimate the actual costs, depending on
the locality of the traﬃc and temporal characteristics
of the customer.
• We study additional aspects of cost-sharing related to
the issues of liability for triggered upgrades, and dis-
crepancies due to non-uniform TCO costs of diﬀerent
network elements.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we
give an overview on what determines the cost of a back-
bone network and present why the sharing of these costs
is a challenging task. We present our methodology in Sec-
tion 3, where we introduce four diﬀerent aspects that af-
fect the quantiﬁed costs of the customers. We describe our
datasets in Section 4. We investigate the costs of customers
and the severity of the diﬀerent types of discrepancies in Sec-
tion 5. Afterwards, we review the related work in Section 6
while we draw the conclusions of our work in Section 7.
2. BACKGROUND
What contributes to the cost of a backbone? The
cost of a network consists of CAPEX and OPEX for all de-
vices and Points-of-Presence (PoPs). The CAPEX is the
one-time cost paid whenever equipment is bought and in-
stalled [23]. It depends on the amount of traﬃc the device
must carry at a speciﬁc level of Quality-of-Service (QoS). A
key observation is that the capacity needed to guarantee a
certain QoS depends on the peak traﬃc that needs to be car-
ried. This is because for a given capacity, QoS is minimized
when the traﬃc peaks.
The OPEX corresponds to operational costs such as real
estate, energy, and personnel. It also depends on the amount
of traﬃc and the QoS; however, that dependence is more
elastic. The cost sharing policies we discuss are generic
1Our methodology is suﬃciently general to be applied in
settings beyond backbone networks, such as 3G networks,
datacenters, etc., but we do not examine such cases here.
Why is it diﬃcult to split cost among customers?
From the above discussion, one may conclude that splitting
the cost among customers is straightforward: for each device
of the network each customer should pay in proportion to
his contribution to the peak traﬃc carried by the device and
then sum up over all devices. Things, however, are not that
simple:
• Accounting complications. It is diﬃcult to know
for each network device the contribution of each cus-
tomer to its peak. This is because backbone opera-
tors need to measure and keep state at many points in
the network, which requires costly monitoring equip-
ments. In addition, computing traﬃc rates introduces
the problem of identifying the appropriate time-scale
for the computation owing to the limited resources of
the monitoring tools.
• Liability complications. If we were to build from
scratch a new network for a ﬁxed set of customers of
known demand, then the cost attributed to each cus-
tomer should be proportional to the sum of its con-
tributions to the peaks of individual devices. Split-
ting costs based on the contribution to the peak is
indeed exact, but only for this “oﬄine problem”. How-
ever, in reality, networks are not deployed as a single
event but grow organically with the addition of new
customers and the ramping up of their traﬃc. Un-
der this more realistic case, peak-based cost-sharing is
not guaranteed to be fair. Consider for example the
case in which a network is already operating at the
maximum utilization allowed by QoS constraints and
a small new customer triggers an expensive upgrade
that leads to a new network with plentiful unallocated
capacity (upgrades typically involve large jumps, e.g.,
1Gbps to 2.5Gbps, to 10Gbps, etc.). Peak-based cost
sharing would attribute to the new customer only a
small fraction of the overall cost. Is that fair? The an-
swer depends on what happens with the unallocated
capacity.
If the network can easily sell it to new or
existing customers then indeed it is fair. If, however,
selling this leftover capacity is not guaranteed, then
the new customer may have a larger liability for the
upgrade costs.
For the above reasons, we will present a methodology in
which we ﬁrst compare among policies of varying complexity,
and then switch to comparing among policies that assign
diﬀerent liability levels.
3. METHODOLOGY
In this section, we present a thorough classiﬁcation of the
discrepancies between methods when a backbone operator
quantiﬁes the costs that its customers inﬂict on the network.
By discrepancy we mean the diﬀerence in a customer’s costs
according to two cost sharing policies. Each type of discrep-
ancy reveals a separate facet of the challenge of customer
cost quantiﬁcation. These facets relate to the following ques-
tions:
• How does the backbone operator compute the cost of
the customers?
510• What kind of traﬃc metering does the backbone op-
erator apply in the network?
• Which customers are liable for the incurred costs?
• How diverse are the costs of the components of the
network?
Before presenting the taxonomy of discrepancies, we ﬁrst
introduce the metric we use to quantify the discrepancies of
a pair of cost sharing procedures. Let N denote the set of
customers who utilize resources in the network. Let A and B
denote the sets of costs allocated to each customer using two
diﬀerent cost sharing policies. It holds that |A| = |B| = |N|.
Accordingly, ai ∈ A denotes the cost of customer i ∈ N
quantiﬁed based on the ﬁrst cost sharing policy while bi ∈ B
represents customer i’s cost based on the second policy. We
deﬁne the discrepancy of the costs of customer i as
d(ai, bi) = max! ai

• Volume-Customer. We measure the amount of
data that a single customer sends on a speciﬁc net-
work device (e.g., on a single link) for the whole an-
alyzed time period. Afterwards, we share the cost of
the device proportionally to the traﬃc volumes of the
customers using it. Hence, the cost of customer i for
device l is:
cl
i = cl · &t∈T xl
&j∈N&t∈T xl
i(t)
j(t)
• 95Percentile-Customer. We distribute the cost
of the device proportional to the 95th percentile [12]
of the customers’ traﬃc that traverses the particular
device:
cl
i = cl ·
P95’. . . , xl
&j∈N P95’. . . , xl
i(t), . . .(
j(t), . . .(

where P95() denotes the 95th percentile of the argu-
ments.

We use this measure of discrepancy because it describes the
relation of the costs with a simple, comprehensible value.
We use several statistics of the customers’ individual dis-
crepancies to quantify the discrepancy of two cost sharing
policies including the 95th percentile and the median.
• Peak-Customer. Under this policy, we share the
expenditure of the network device proportional to the
customers’ maximum usage volumes for the given time
interval:
We now describe how we determine the aggregate cost
that the sharing policies distribute. A network consists of
various network devices, such as routers and links. Let L
denote the set of devices of the network. Let xl
i(t) denote
the traﬃc volume of customer i ∈ N on network device
l ∈ L during the time interval t ∈ [1, T ]. Furthermore, let cl
denote the cost of network device l ∈ L.
The cost of a speciﬁc device depends on the maximum
amount of traﬃc that it has to carry during a certain time
interval. Thus, we obtain cl by examining the available ca-
pacity rates of the device (e.g., 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, etc.) and
then using the cost of the smallest device whose capacity
satisﬁes the requested Service Level Agreement (SLA) for
the given traﬃc demand. We assume that the backbone
operator fulﬁlls its SLA by upgrading its devices when uti-
lization hits the 50% threshold. To this end, we assume that
the costs follow a step function C : R → R. Thus, the cost
of device l is
cl = C#max

3.1 F-discrepancies
The ﬁrst source of discrepancies between cost allocation
methods is the function that the backbone operator uses
to compute the contribution of the customers to the aggre-
gate cost. We next present four policies that strike diﬀerent
balances between precision and resource needs, which we
discuss in more details at the end of this section. We con-
sider these methods because backbone operators apply some
of these policies (e.g., the 95Percentile-Customer and the
Aggregate-Peak-Device) in practice to determine the costs a
customer inﬂicts and consequently the price the customers
pays. For example, one can easily map some of the tar-
