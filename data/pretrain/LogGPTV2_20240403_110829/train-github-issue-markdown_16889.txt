I create a table like Table wich contains  
`CheckBox Name LastName`.  
When I translate from one page to another I find that the headers `Name` and
`LastName` translate from one page to another due to the length of their
strings.  
I added a style for TableCell :
    width: 40%
But this doesn't solve the problem. How can I fix the headers columns to not
translate from one page to another due the length of strings?
