I've stumbled over many sites that are using "weak" ciphers, and deno doesn't
provide a mechanism to make fetch calls to those sites, it instead errors out
with:
    TLS alert received: Message {
        typ: Alert,
        version: TLSv1_2,
        payload: Alert(
            AlertMessagePayload {
                level: Fatal,
                description: HandshakeFailure,
            },
        ),
    }
I've checked #10447 and while it's related, this is more of a broad issue
rather than a single site, because contacting every affected website operator
and get them to upgrade their suite is not feasible. Instead, having an option
to disable cipher alerts and proceed with the connection would be ideal,
especially for those that are coming from node (where this limitation doesn't
exists) and want to migrate/create an API based on deno.
