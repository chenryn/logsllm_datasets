Security Economics
– A Personal Perspective

ABSTRACT
This paper describes the origins of security economics. The
birth of this thriving new discipline is sometimes credited to
a talk I gave at ACSAC in December 2001, but the story is
more complex. After sabbatical visits to Berkeley in 2001–
2 to work with Hal Varian, we organised the ﬁrst Work-
shop on the Economics of Information Security in June 2002.
Since then the ﬁeld has grown to encompass arguments over
open versus proprietary systems, the econometrics of online
crime, the behavioural economics of security and much else.
It has started to have a signiﬁcant impact on policy, with
security-economics studies of cybercrime and infrastructure
vulnerability being adopted as policy in the EU, while secu-
rity economics PhDs have got inﬂuential jobs in the White
House and elsewhere.

1. EARLY DAYS
The ACSAC organisers have asked me to talk about the
history of security economics. This subject is often consid-
ered to have been started by a paper I gave at ACSAC in
December 2001, entitled “Why Information Security is Hard
– An Economic Perspective” [2]. This paper had actually
been put together from the new material on security eco-
nomics which I’d written in my ‘Security Engineering’ book
that ﬁrst appeared in the summer of 2001 [3], and had al-
ready got its ﬁrst public airing at SOSP as an invited talk
in October of that year. Other people also contributed sig-
niﬁcantly to getting the subject oﬀ the ground. I’ve been
digging through the old emails to refresh my memory of
what happened.
I ﬁrst got to know Hal Varian, then an economics professor
at Michigan, by email when we served on a program com-
mittee together. He then moved to Berkeley and I arranged
to meet him for dinner while I was at the IEEE Security
and Privacy event in Oakland in May 2000. After dinner,

he drove me back to the Claremont, and we still had so much
to talk about that we sat there in his car for about an hour,
missing most of the conference drinks reception.
Hal had been thinking about the various online payment
systems that were competing then, and from which Pay-
Pal would later emerge as the victor. He understood the
importance of liability assignment as a critical feature of
the growth of credit cards and was thinking about how this
insight might apply there. He’d come across my 1993 pa-
per “Why Cryptosystems Fail” which studied ATM fraud
and described some of the liability shifts in debit card pay-
ments [4]. I’d been wondering why US banks spent less on
security than British banks, despite bearing more liability
for card fraud. I recalled I’d mentioned this in a 1994 paper
‘Liability and Computer Security’ [5], and it still puzzled
me. Hal suggested it was a classic case of moral hazard: UK
banks were shielded by inappropriate liability laws, so they
got lazy and careless, leading to an epidemic of fraud, and
gave me a copy of a new book, ‘Information Rules,’ that
he’d written with Carl Shapiro [34]. A few days later, he
sent me a draft of a column he’d written for the New York
Times discussing this [39], which talked of diﬀuse responsi-
bility leading to DDoS attacks and suggested placing more
liability on ISPs; he also pointed me at law-and-economics
analysis of where liability should go [35].
Hal’s book had a big impact on my thinking. That sum-
mer, I was busy completing my ‘Security Engineering’ book,
and increasingly I found that it was the story about incen-
tives that linked up the diﬀerent case histories and made
them speak to the systems engineering principles that I was
trying to distill and explain. On 9 September I emailed Hal
to say that having read it a couple of times, I was “getting
more and more aware of security failures that occur because
people don’t understand the underlying network economics”.
I asked him to proofread the security-economics arguments
in the draft chapters on e-commerce and assurance, which
became sections 19.6, 19.7 and 23.2, as these were where I
used sustained economic arguments. His feedback was very
useful in polishing these. There were plenty bits and pieces
of economics elsewhere in the book; for example chapter 22
incorporates John Adams’ thinking on the risk thermostat
and other examples or moral hazard, giving an early entry
to behavioral ideas, while section 22.6 on ‘Economic issues’,
summarises a variety of other arguments about incentives.
As I’d been hired to the Cambridge faculty in 1995, I
was due a year’s sabbatical in 2001–2, and following this
lively and productive exchange I started talking to Hal about
taking some of that sabbatical in Berkeley, at which he was
139
enthusiastic. He also sent me a copy of his undergraduate
microeconomics textbook.
Although Hal was an important inspiration for the early
work on security economics, he was not alone. Andrew
Odlyzko had already remarked that the poor user-friendliness
of both Microsoft software and the Internet is due to the
fact that both Microsoft and the Internet achieved success
by appealing to developers at least as much as to users [31];
extending this insight to security was obvious once I’d read
Hal’s book.
My book ﬁnally went oﬀ to the printers in January 2001.
I’d extracted from Wiley, the publisher, an agreement that
I could carve out the new material on security economics
into a paper, and this became ‘Why Information Security is
Hard – An Economic Perspective’ which appeared at AC-
SAC in December 2001 and got about 17 listeners. In fact,
it had already appeared as an invited paper before then at
the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in Banﬀ,
Alberta in October 2011 where the audience was somewhat
larger. The idea that platforms like Windows are insecure
not because Microsoft engineers are careless, but because
Microsoft had to appeal to developers at least as much as
to end users in order to win platform races against the Mac
and against OS/2, seemed to grab the SOSP crowd as a
new and interesting angle. The paper also exposed them to
the consequences of statistical failure models [14], where the
black hats can attack anywhere but the white hats must de-
fend everywhere; and the eﬀects of asymmetric information
in creating lemons markets [1].
2. FROM 9/11 TO THE FIRST WEIS
By the time I gave the SOSP talk at Banﬀ, the 9/11 at-
tacks had taken place, and security had suddenly become
salient to a lot of people who hadn’t given it much thought
before. My own thoughts on the attacks were still evolving,
but I put a few paragraphs on them in the ACSAC version
of the paper just before the submission deadline. Like many
people I was seriously alarmed that an enraged overreaction
would do serious damage to the prospects for peace in the
Middle East and for civil liberties, but I saw the invasion of
Afghanistan as inevitable. I drew an analogy with piracy in
the early 19th century, where the infant USA fought the ﬁrst
Barbary war with Algeria and Tunisia in 1801–5 because of
attacks on US shipping, despite its aversion to colonialism
and noted: “Liberals faced tough moral dilemmas: was it
acceptable to conquer and colonise a particular territory, in
order to suppress piracy and slavery there?”
I also remarked that “I believe that the kind of economic
arguments advanced here will be found to apply to protect-
ing bricks as much as clicks”. As the war rhetoric ramped
up, it was clear that no individual could push back on the
public mood; the few academics who bravely tried to warn of
the ever-less rational approach to risk (such as John Adams)
were given a hard time in the media or just ignored. I reck-
oned that the best contribution I could make would be to
build up the systematic approach. The academic method,
like the proverbial mills of God, may grind slow but it grinds
everything pretty small in the end. Our mission should be
to understand risk, systems, crime and conﬂict; to build the
models; to collect the data; and to be ready with solid policy
advice once the world returned to its senses.
From Banﬀ I ﬂew to Berkeley and spent October-November
2001 there on sabbatical. Hal and I talked about security
with other economists, such as Carl Shapiro and Suzanne
Scotchmer, and laid plans to hold the ﬁrst Workshop on the
Economics of Information Security. I got acquainted with
the work of George Akerlof, a Berkeley professor who’d just
won the Nobel for his pioneering work on asymmetric infor-
mation; his ‘market for lemons’ paper describes how used
cars sell at a discount because buyers can’t tell good ones
from bad ones. This applies in spades to security products.
Other inﬂuences included Jack Hirshleifer, the founder of
conﬂict theory. By then search engines had arrived in the
form of Altavista, so we were able to ﬁnd a number of iso-
lated early articles applying economic ideas to security, track
down their authors and invite them.
Next stop was Singapore for two weeks at the end of
November and start of December; while there I taught a
crypto course and read a lot on environmental economics. I
started to think about other aspects of lockin – for exam-
ple, it cost Brazil a fortune to move its cars from petrol to
alcohol – and about scaremongering, which was a big topic
in the environmental debate at the time as well as the main
response to 9/11 of many governments and security ven-
dors. After Christmas at home, it was on the road again;
I spent January–February 2002 at MIT, mostly working on
technical topics such as API security and next-generation
peer-to-peer systems; this led in due course to two large col-
laborative projects between Cambridge and MIT.
I went back to Berkeley for May-June 2002, staying from
the Oakland conference through WEIS. We started to re-
alise that with security economics we’d hit a sweet spot.
The theoretical computer science crowd at Berkeley were
working simultaneously on algorithmic mechanism design;
the ﬁrst paper may have been one of Hal’s [37], but a recent
(2001) paper by Nisan and Ronen [29] was inspiring security
work such as the paper by Joan Feigenbaum and others on
strategy-proof BGP routing [16]. At SIMS, John Chuang
was also working on networks, mechanism design and secu-
rity. (There would be some exchange with this community
over the years with overlap in authorship between WEIS and
conferences such as ACM EC and Gamesec.)
The high point of the trip was WEIS. Hal and I had not
been the only people to talk of security and economics, but
WEIS brought the threads together. What had previously
been occasional scattered observations suddenly acquired
critical mass and became a ‘discipline’.
In addition to my early papers on ATM security, there was
a paper of Hal’s, “Economic Aspects of Personal Privacy”,
which in 1996 had described how markets for information
could enhance welfare if they stop us being pestered by ir-
relevant ads [38]. Hal in turn cited a 1996 Comm ACM
paper by Laudon, which discussed market failures in pri-
vacy and suggested a national information market by ex-
tending celebs’ right to get compensation for commercial
use of their images to ordinary mortals and their “data im-
ages”) [26]. Carl Landwehr pointed us at US DoD concerns
at security market failure dating from 1991 when an NRC
report pointed this problem out [28].
New work at the ﬁrst WEIS included Alessandro Acquisti
introducing behavioural economics into the ﬁeld. He applied
it to the economics of privacy on which he’d worked with
Hal as part of his thesis, showing that the Pareto-optimal
outcomes envisaged in Hal’s 1996 paper could be prevented
by information asymmetry caused by uncontrolled informa-
tion spread, user myopia, and the small size of the market
140
for privacy. On the practical side, Jean Camp proposed a
market in vulnerabilities, which rapidly turned into reality.
She’d ﬁrst written on security economics in 2000 at ISW,
where she proposed tradable ’pollution’ permits for insecure
systems. (Vulnerability markets took oﬀ rapidly, with two
startups already in 2002.) On the theory side, Larry Gor-
don, Marty Loeb and Bill Lucyshyn applied the literature
on trade associations to analyse the need for information
sharing on security vulnerabilities within speciﬁc industries,
an issue that had become salient with the US government
promotion of ISACs. For Microsoft, Barb Fox introduced us
to the economics of standards, describing how Netscape had
abandoned SSL and that “dead dinosaurs get eaten”.
