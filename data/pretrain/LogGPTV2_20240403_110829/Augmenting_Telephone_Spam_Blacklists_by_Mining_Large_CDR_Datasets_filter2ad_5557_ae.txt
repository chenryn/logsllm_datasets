Table 5). To this end, we queried these numbers on Baidu again
three months after the initial query in July 2017. Please note that
these numbers did not have any complaints in July, when Baidu
was initially queried. Table 6 lists the number of queried unknown
numbers, unknown numbers that have received complaints three
months later, unknown numbers that on the query date still did not
have complaints, and unknown numbers that Baidu did not have
any information for. The table also reports the ratio of unknown
numbers with complaints over all the unknown numbers that were
re-queried (“cmp to all ratio” column).
only show the spam numbers in the figure). As it can be observed,
the eight labeled spam numbers construct a fully-connected graph
which indicates that these spam numbers called a lot of destination
numbers with overlapping prefixes. We count the number of dis-
tinct common destination number prefixes for each pair of spam
numbers (28 pairs in total), and list the min, max, and average of
the number of common prefixes among them in Table 7.

The percentage of newly labeled spam numbers that received
complaints later out of all numbers identified as spam by our system
is above 70% for all the three days. This suggests that most of the
potentially harmful numbers that our system predicted as spam
actually received complaints from regular users according to Baidu.
As a result, these results show that our system is capable of detecting
new, previously unknown numbers as spam in very early stages.
This could help service providers to quickly add these numbers to
their blacklists and warn users if they receive a call from them.
6.4 Case Study
In this section, we study one of pure spam clusters that was gener-
ated on 07/15 as an example. This cluster contained eight labeled
spam numbers and 28 unknown numbers. The labeled spam num-
bers are listed as follows:
0015317092663
0015317212923
0015317268089
0015317801086

Figure 11 shows the pairwise correlation in terms of common
prefixes of destination numbers called by these eight spam numbers.
In the figure, red nodes represent spam source numbers, and the
edges indicate the existence of both 6- and 7-digit common desti-
nation prefixes among nodes (for clarity and to avoid clutter, we
Figure 11: Spam numbers in a sample cluster and their com-
mon destination number prefixes
We can observe that these spam numbers not only share a large
number of common 6- and 7-digit destination prefixes, but also have
common prefixes among themselves, that is the source numbers
themselves are also similar. This is interesting as our clustering
approach does not consider prefix similarity among source numbers.
So this case shows that common prefix of destination numbers,
one set of features used in our proposed detection system, is a
good indicator of spam number similarity that could separate the
spam and benign numbers from each other. Also, this example
demonstrates that spammers could employ colluding numbers and
distribute the destination numbers from their hit list among these
source numbers.

Unfortunately, obtaining real-word CDR datasets is very difficult,
due to regulatory and privacy-related constraints. Because of this,
our evaluation is based on CDR data collected from a single collab-
orating telephone network provider based in China. It is possible
that the thresholds we set for our evaluation, including the number
of digit for the prefix-based features, may need to be adjusted for
datasets collected in other countries, where the format of telephone
numbers may be different. However, our paper lays the ground
work for performing such tuning.
The main challenge faced by our system is due to caller ID spoof-
ing. To evade detection, spammers may attempt to leverage spoof-
ing more aggressively, and to partition the set of target destination
numbers so to minimize the prefix overlap between colluding spam
numbers. While this may be theoretically possible, it is not clear
how costly this could be for the spammers. In fact, as we mentioned
earlier in the paper (Section 1), spam numbers are typically reused
for several days. Furthermore, telephone networks are currently
in the process of implementing caller ID authentication protocols,
which will make spoofing more difficult and will naturally prolong
the life of phone numbers involved in spam campaigns, thus making
blacklisting more effective.
We also need to consider that computing the pairwise distance
matrix between phone numbers is an expensive operation, which
a compute cost that grows quadratically with the number of in-
put source numbers. To alleviate this issue, we have made use of
parallelized computation. However, memory pressure is also a con-
cern, besides the time needed for computation. Fortunately, both
problems could be further mitigated by computing an approximate
distance matrix, by leveraging methods such as locality sensitive
hashing [12] and highly scalable clustering algorithms such as
Birch [24]. In essence, these methods would allow us to find a
coarse-grained clustering, where points in a coarse-grained cluster
represent spam numbers that are close up to a given lax threshold.
Then, exact pairwise distances would need to be computed only
for points within the same cluster, thus dramatically reducing the
complexity of our clustering module.
8 CONCLUSION
We present a novel detection system that aims to discover tele-
phone numbers involved in spam campaigns. Given a small seed
of known spam phone numbers, our system uses a combination of
unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to mine
new, previously unknown spam numbers from large datasets of call
detail records (CDRs). We described how our system could be used
to expand the phone blacklist, and supported our contributions by
conducting experiments over a large dataset of real-world CDRs
provided by a leading telephony provider in China. The experimen-
tal results show that our system is able to greatly expand on the
initial seed of known spam numbers by up to about 250% with no
false positives.
