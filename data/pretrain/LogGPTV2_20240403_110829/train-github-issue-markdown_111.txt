    Not sure if this is the correct place to raise the issue or not. One annoyance I found
    while looking at Go is that every page on golang.org has the same title. This is really
    annoying for using the reference documentation with numerous tabs for different packages
    open as it is hard to know which tab is for the package I want. It would be useful if
    the titles reflected the content of the page.
