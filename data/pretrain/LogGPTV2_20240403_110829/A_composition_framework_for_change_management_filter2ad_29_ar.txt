Ensure Common Understanding 
Communication activities in this process phase focus on informing end users and  
Stakeholders  regarding  post-deployment  support  and  changes  to  the  system  
or processes. Communication messages serve to inform involved parties about  
the close out and transition of the OCM-related project eforts to the operational  
support organization. Figure 2-3 shows the Communication Knowledge Area goal  
in the Closing Process Phase. 
Communication  is  imperative  in  educating  key  Stakeholders,  project  team 
members,  and  other  resources  about  the  process  of  closing  out  the  project 
and  transferring  the  responsibilities  to  the  support  organization.  A  lack  of 
communication at this stage may lead to confusion in responsibilities, inability 
to  obtain  ongoing  maintenance  from  the  support  organization,  incomplete 
actions, or unresolved issues. 
Figure  2-4  provides  the  inputs,  roles,  skills,  activities,  tools,  and  outputs  of 
Communication in the Closing Process Phase.

Project Team Role/Responsibility Changes: As the project team is dispersed, 
the  team,  executive  leadership,  and  other  identified  individuals  need  to  be 
aware of who will be responsible for communications and OCM-related issues 
post deployment. It is not uncommon that diferent resources become involved 
in  the  operations  support  of  the  new  processes  and  systems;  therefore,  it  is 
important  to  plan  and  manage  the  transition  of  communications  to  clearly 
identified resources. 
Timeline:  End  users  and  Stakeholders  need  to  be  aware  of  transition  and 
closeout activities. The OCM Practitioner should review the Project Schedule 
and collaborate with the Project Manager to communicate projected start and 
end dates for key Closing Process Phase activities. 
The OCM Practitioner may utilize the Communication Action Log started in the 
Planning  Process  Phase  to  track  all  Closing  Process  Phase  communications. 
This  working  document  allows  the  OCM  Practitioner,  Project  Manager, 
Project  Sponsor,  and  other  key  individuals  to  monitor  the  dissemination  of 
communications throughout the Closing Process Phase. 
Communication Mechanisms:  Working with the Project Manager and team, 
the OCM Practitioner helps identify OCM communication mechanisms, whether 
existing  or  new,  for  ongoing  communications  post  deployment.  Existing 
mechanisms  may  include  any  of  the  communication  or  feedback  channels 
identified in earlier process phases. For more information on communication 
and feedback mechanisms, review the Communication Knowledge Area sections 
of the Planning and Executing Process Phase chapters. New mechanisms may 
include: 
•  Help Hotline: A centralized call center number that is communicated 
and available to obtain support. There may need to be a mechanism to 
distinguish between end users and external Stakeholders given diferent 
needs for support hours and types of help. 
•  Alerts: System-generated alerts to provide key system or other solution  
information can be extremely timely and helpful in communicating  
pertinent information such as critical changes, downtime, or other updates. 
•  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): Ofen intranets or extranets can provide 
self-help information for the new processes and systems through the use 
of FAQs. Before deployment, an initial list should be developed by the 
operational support team and be available and published to help with 
anticipated questions. These FAQs evolve based on help commonly sought 
by users that can be addressed in FAQs.

Training serves to educate end users and Stakeholders on the new solution prior 
to implementation. In the Closing Process Phase, training resources working 
with  the  OCM  Practitioner  evaluate  the  efectiveness  of  end  user  training 
in  order  to  identify  and  address  any  additional  training  needs,  as  shown  in 
Figure 2-5. The Training Knowledge Area remains critical for project success, 
as it influences the ability for end users and Stakeholders to master changes 
brought about by the technology implementation and successfully transition 
to the future state.

2.3.1 Inputs 
In order to complete the Closing Process Phase Training activities, the training 
resources and the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the 
following inputs: 
Training Plan: The Training Plan, developed in the Executing Process Phase, 
sets the stage for the training development, delivery, and evaluation processes. 
Training  Curriculum:  The  training  curriculum,  developed  in  the  Executing 
Process Phase, provides a high level overview of the training program, including 
courses, course descriptions and objectives, delivery channels, and intended 
audiences. The training curriculum is based on the requirements set forth in the 
Training Plan and serves as a valuable input to material development, training 
delivery, and training evaluation.

2.3.3 Activities 
It  is  important  for  training  resources  such  as  the  Training  Lead,  Instructors, 
Facilitators and Coaches, who may work with the OCM Practitioner, to evaluate 
the efectiveness of the end user training program. To evaluate the training, the 
following questions should be asked: 
•  Did end users gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities set forth  
in the training objectives? 
•  Are they able to use the new system and any new processes?

•  Are there any gaps that need to be addressed? 
Two Training activities occur during this process phase: 
•  Evaluate training 
•  Coordinate development and delivery of ongoing training 
Evaluate Training 
Regardless of the efort put into assessing training needs, developing training 
materials, and delivering a training program, there may be ongoing end user 
training  needs  post  implementation.  Utilizing  surveys,  feedback  from  those 
involved, and system data will allow the Training Lead and associated resources 
working with the OCM Practitioner to collect training metrics and identify any 
gaps or opportunists for additional training. 
Evaluating the training program is key in determining the efectiveness of the 
Training  Plan,  curriculum,  and  materials,  and  identifying  opportunities  to 
provide  additional  training,  as  needed.  The  Methods  of  Evaluation  model  of 
training evaluation, developed by Donald Kirkpatrick , consists of four levels of 
evaluation as shown in the table below. 
Evaluation 
Category 
Description 
Reaction 
This category measures participants’ reactions to the training:  
•  Did participants feel the training program was useful in 
their jobs? 
•  Were they satisfied with the instructor/room/schedule? 
•  Was the material presented relevant and eficiently 
presented? 
Reaction training feedback obtained at the conclusion of 
the training sessions helps to refine the training program, 
content, and/or materials.

Category 
Knowledge 
Description 
This category measures the extent to which learning 
objectives have been met. 
•  Did the participants gain the necessary knowledge,  
skills, and abilities? 
•  Can they demonstrate these knowledge, skills,  
and abilities? 
Knowledge can be measured using several methods,  
including practical or written tests, completing simulations,  
or demonstrating skills in a test or actual environment. 
Transfer of 
Learning 
This category measures a participant’s ability to 
demonstrate new knowledge, skills, and abilities in the  
real world future state. 
•  Can participants perform their new job roles with 
minimal support? 
•  What potential gaps can be identified? 
Gaps in transfer of learning should be identified by  
observing end users performing tasks in the new system and  
by reviewing metrics related to an end user’s performance. 
Impact/ 
Results 
This category measures the impact that training has had on  
the implementation and organization. Impact/results can  
be assessed through calculation of a return on investment. 
While each of these areas are helpful in the evaluation, the training resources 
and OCM Practitioner should focus on the Knowledge and Transfer of Learning 
evaluation categories described in the Methods of Evaluation table above. It 
is  important  to  understand  if  the  training  program  achieved  the  identified 
objectives and, if so, if end users are able to transfer the new knowledge, skills, 
and abilities into their new working environment.
