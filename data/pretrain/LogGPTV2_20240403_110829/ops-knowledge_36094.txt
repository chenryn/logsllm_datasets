Question: Consider the following Java code snippet:

  Long total = 0L;
  for (long j = 0; j < 1000000; j++) {
    total += j;
  }

Which of the following changes could improve the performance of this code?
"A": "Replace 'Long' with 'long' when declaring the 'total' variable to avoid unnecessary autoboxing.",
"B": "Use a 'HashMap' to store each increment operation instead of a primitive operation.",
"C": "Change the loop condition to iterate until 'Long.MAX_VALUE' to increase the range of values.",
"D": "Wrap the loop inside a synchronized block to ensure thread safety."
Answer: A
