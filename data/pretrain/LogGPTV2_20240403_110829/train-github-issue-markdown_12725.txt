##### Feature Request
I like sticking with Three.js' built in animation system so everything works
off the same clock. Most of the stuff you find on the internet suggests using
a third party tweening api, but that must be out of date because
AnimationClip.js really takes care of business for just about anything you
want. However, I don't see any way to pass an easing function to guide the
interpolation process. It looks like the mixer autonomously makes the decision
later and everything comes out linear.
Any chance you could let us pass an easing function on creation of a clip?
Best Regards
