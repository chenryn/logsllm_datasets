User: Please answer the following questions. How to expand the logical volume (LV) of Linux?
Assistant: 1. View the current logical volume and volume group Use the commands `lvdisplay` and `vgdisplay` to view the current logical volume and volume group information. 2. Extend the physical volume of the volume group. If the volume group where your logical volume is located does not have enough free space, please add a physical volume. You can use the `fdisk` command or a partitioning tool such as GParted to create a new partition and add it to the volume group. 3. Extend the logical volume Use the `lvextend` command to extend the size of the logical volume. For example, the following command will increase `/dev/vg1/lv1` by 10GB: ``` lvextend -L +10G /dev/vg1/lv1 ``` 4. Extend the file system using the `resize2fs` command (EXT file system) or ` xfs_growfs` command (XFS filesystem) to grow a filesystem on a logical volume. For example, the following command extends the filesystem on `/dev/vg1/lv1` to the new size of the logical volume: ``` resize2fs /dev/vg1/lv1 ``` or ``` xfs_growfs /dev/vg1/lv1 ` `` 5. Verify that the expansion was successful using the `df -h` command. You should now be able to see the new capacity of the logical volume.
