Abstract
Voice over IP (VoIP) has become a popular protocol for
making phone calls over the Internet. Due to the poten-
tial transit of sensitive conversations over untrusted net-
work infrastructure, it is well understood that the con-
tents of a VoIP session should be encrypted. However,
we demonstrate that current cryptographic techniques do
not provide adequate protection when the underlying au-
dio is encoded using bandwidth-saving Variable Bit Rate
(VBR) coders. Explicitly, we use the length of encrypted
VoIP packets to tackle the challenging task of identifying
the language of the conversation. Our empirical analysis
of 2,066 native speakers of 21 different languages shows
that a substantial amount of information can be discerned
from encrypted VoIP trafﬁc. For instance, our 21-way
classiﬁer achieves 66% accuracy, almost a 14-fold im-
provement over random guessing. For 14 of the 21 lan-
guages, the accuracy is greater than 90%. We achieve
an overall binary classiﬁcation (e.g., “Is this a Spanish
or English conversation?”) rate of 86.6%. Our analysis
highlights what we believe to be interesting new privacy
issues in VoIP.

Introduction
Over the last several years, Voice over IP (VoIP) has
enjoyed a marked increase in popularity, particularly as
a replacement of traditional telephony for international
calls. At the same time, the security and privacy impli-
cations of conducting everyday voice communications
over the Internet are not yet well understood. For the
most part, the current focus on VoIP security has centered
around efﬁcient techniques for ensuring conﬁdentiality
of VoIP conversations [3, 6, 14, 37]. Today, because of
the success of these efforts and the attention they have re-
ceived, it is now widely accepted that VoIP trafﬁc should
be encrypted before transmission over the Internet. Nev-
ertheless, little, if any, work has explored the threat of
trafﬁc analysis of encrypted VoIP calls.
In this paper,
we show that although encryption prevents an eavesdrop-
per from reading packet contents and thereby listening in
on VoIP conversations (for example, using [21]), trafﬁc
analysis can still be used to infer more information than
expected—namely, the spoken language of the conversa-
tion. Identifying the spoken language in VoIP communi-
cations has several obvious applications, many of which
have substantial privacy ramiﬁcations [7].
The type of trafﬁc analysis we demonstrate in this pa-
per is made possible because current recommendations
for encrypting VoIP trafﬁc (generally, the application of
length-preserving stream ciphers) do not conceal the size
of the plaintext messages. While leaking message size
may not pose a signiﬁcant risk for more traditional forms
of electronic communication such as email, properties of
real-time streaming media like VoIP greatly increase the
potential for an attacker to extract meaningful informa-
tion from plaintext length. For instance, the size of an en-
coded audio frame may have much more meaningful se-
mantics than the size of a text document. Consequently,
while the size of an email message likely carries little in-
formation about its contents, the use of bandwidth-saving
techniques such as variable bit rate (VBR) coding means
that the size of a VoIP packet is directly determined by
the type of sound its payload encodes. This informa-
tion leakage is exacerbated in VoIP by the sheer num-
ber of packets that are sent, often on the order of tens or
hundreds every second. Access to such large volumes of
packets over a short period of time allows an adversary to
quickly estimate meaningful distributions over the packet
lengths, and in turn, to learn information about the lan-
guage being spoken.
Identifying spoken languages is a task that, on the sur-
face, may seem simple. However it is a problem that
has not only received substantial attention in the speech
and natural language processing community, but has also
been found to be challenging even with access to full
acoustic data. Our results show an encrypted conversa-

tion over VoIP can leak information about its contents,
to the extent that an eavesdropper can successfully in-
fer what language is being spoken. The fact that VoIP
packet lengths can be used to perform any sort of lan-
guage identiﬁcation is interesting in and of itself. Our
success with language identiﬁcation in this setting pro-
vides strong grounding for mandating the use of fixed
length compression techniques in VoIP, or for requiring
the underlying cryptographic engine to pad each packet
to a common length.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We be-
gin in Section 2 by reviewing why and how voice over IP
technologies leak information about the language spoken
in an encrypted call. In Section 3, we describe our design
for a classiﬁer that exploits this information leakage to
automatically identify languages based on packet sizes.
We evaluate this classiﬁer’s effectiveness in Section 4,
using open source VoIP software and audio samples from
a standard data set used in the speech processing com-
munity. We review related work on VoIP security and
information leakage attacks in Section 5, and conclude
in Section 6.

Information Leakage via Variable Bit
Rate Encoding
To highlight why language identiﬁcation is possible in
encrypted VoIP streams, we find it instructive to first re-
view the relevant inner workings of a modern VoIP sys-
tem. Most VoIP calls use at least two protocols: (1)
a signaling protocol such as the Session Initiation Pro-
tocol (SIP) [23] used for locating the callee and estab-
lishing the call and (2) the Real Time Transport Proto-
col (RTP) [25, 4] which transmits the audio data, en-
coded using a special-purpose speech codec, over UDP.
While several speech codecs are available (including
G.711 [10], G.729 [12], Speex [29], and iLBC [2]),
we choose the Speex codec for our investigation as
it offers several advanced features like a VBR mode
and discontinuous transmission, and its source code is
freely available. Additionally, although Speex is not
the only codec to offer variable bit rate encoding for
speech [30, 16, 20, 35, 5], it is the most popular of those
that do.
Speex, like most other modern speech codecs, is based
on code-excited linear prediction (CELP) [24]. In CELP,
the encoder uses vector quantization with both a fixed
codebook and an adaptive codebook [22] to encode a
window of n audio samples as one frame. For example,
in the Speex default narrowband mode, the audio input is
sampled at 8kHz, and the frames each encode 160 sam-
ples from the source waveform. Hence, a packet contain-
ing one Speex frame is typically transmitted every 20ms.
In VBR mode, the encoder takes advantage of the fact
that some sounds are easier to represent than others. For
example, with Speex, vowels and high-energy transients

require higher bit rates than fricative sounds like “s” or
“f” [28]. To achieve improved sound quality and a low
(average) bit rate, the encoder uses fewer bits to encode
frames which contain “easy” sounds and more bits for
frames with sounds that are harder to encode. Because
the VBR encoder selects the best bit rate for each frame,
the size of a packet can be used as a predictor of the bit
rate used to encode the corresponding frame. Therefore,
given only packet lengths, it is possible to extract infor-
mation about the underlying speech. Figure 1, for exam-
ple, shows an audio input, the encoder’s bit rate, and the
resulting packet sizes as the information is sent on the
wire; notice how strikingly similar the last two cases are.
As discussed earlier, by now it is commonly accepted
that VoIP trafﬁc should not be transmitted over the Inter-
net without some additional security layer [14, 21]. In-
deed, a number of proposals for securing VoIP have al-
ready been introduced. One such proposal calls for tun-
neling VoIP over IPSec, but doing so imposes unaccept-
able delays on a real-time protocol [3]. An alternative,
endorsed by NIST [14], is the Secure Real Time Trans-
port Protocol (SRTP) [4]. SRTP is an extension to RTP
and provides conﬁdentiality, authenticity, and integrity
for real-time applications. SRTP allows for three modes
of encryption: AES in counter mode, AES in f8-mode,
and no encryption. For the two stream ciphers, the stan-
dard states that “in case the payload size is not an inte-
ger multiple of (the block length), the excess bits of the
key stream are simply discarded” [4]. Moreover, while
the standard permits higher level protocols to pad their
messages, the default in SRTP is to use length-preserving
encryption and so one can still derive information about
the underlying speech by observing the lengths of the en-
crypted payloads.
Given that the sizes of encrypted payloads are closely
related to bit rates used by the speech encoder, a perti-
nent question is whether different languages are encoded
at different bit rates. Our conjecture is that this is in-
deed the case, and to test this hypothesis we examine
real speech data from the Oregon Graduate Institute Cen-
ter for Speech Learning and Understanding’s “22 Lan-
guage” telephone speech corpus [15]. The data set con-
sists of speech from native speakers of 21 languages,
recorded over a standard telephone line at 8kHz. This
is the same sampling rate used by the Speex narrowband
mode. General statistics about the data set are provided
in Appendix A.
As a preliminary test of our hypothesis, we encoded
all of the audio files from the CSLU corpus and recorded
the sequence of bit rates used by Speex for each file. In
narrowband VBR mode with discontinuous transmission
enabled, Speex encodes the data set using nine distinct
bit rates, ranging from 0.25kbps up to 24.6kbps. Fig-
ure 2 shows the frequency for each bit rate for English,
Brazilian Portuguese, German, and Hungarian. For most
bit rates, the frequencies for English are quite close to
those for Portuguese; but Portuguese and Hungarian ap-
pear to exhibit different distributions. This results sug-
gest that distinguishing Portuguese from Hungarian, for
example, would be less challenging than differentiating
Portuguese from English, or Indosesian from Russian
(see Figure 3).
Figures 4 and 5 provide additional evidence that bi-
gram frequencies (i.e., the number of instances of con-
secutively observed bit rate pairs) differ between lan-
guages. The x and y axes of both ﬁgures specify ob-
served bit rates. The density of the square (x, y) shows
the difference in probability of bigram x, y between the
two languages divided by the average probability of bi-
gram x, y between the two. Thus, dark squares indicate
