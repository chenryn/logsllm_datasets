Given a role:
web_server /  
tasks /  
main.yml  
files /  
httpd.conf
And a task:
  * name: sync | httpd confnig  
synchronize: src=httpd.conf dest=/etc/apache2/conf.d/widget.conf
You'll get an error because it assumes httpd.conf is based in the same
directory you call ansible playbook from. The copy module however will happily
check files/ for you.
