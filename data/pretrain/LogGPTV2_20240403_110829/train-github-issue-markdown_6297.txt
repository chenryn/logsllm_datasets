We started getting this deprecation warning but I don't know what to do with
it. Is there somewhere in your documentation that would explain this more?
Thanks! Example log:
https://github.com/astropy/astropy/runs/6838665326?check_suite_focus=true
    matplotlib._api.deprecation.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: The checkdep_usetex function
    was deprecated in Matplotlib 3.6 and will be removed two minor releases later.
    Use Vendor the code instead.
We use it like this:
     TEX_UNAVAILABLE = not matplotlib.checkdep_usetex(True)
Hard to tell from the traceback where this is coming from inside matplotlib
because the warning went through a generic `matplotlib/_api/deprecation.py`.
