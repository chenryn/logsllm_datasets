### Identifying Common Followers and Conversations Using TweetBeaver

#### Finding Common Followers
TweetBeaver offers a feature to quickly identify common followers between two Twitter accounts, which can be particularly useful in investigations. For instance, if Twitter user `jms_dot_py` is suspected of embezzlement and has been observed interacting with `humanhacker` about tax evasion, you can use TweetBeaver to find the 371 people who follow both accounts. This narrows down the list of potential suspects from a combined 45,500 followers to a more manageable number, though it still requires careful analysis.

#### Analyzing Conversations
Once you have identified two users of interest, you can focus on their conversations. TweetBeaver provides a convenient way to extract and present these conversations in a spreadsheet format. In a hypothetical scenario, six conversations between the author and `jms_dot_py` were identified, as shown in Figure 11.12.

#### Downloading a User’s Friends List
This feature allows you to collect a list of accounts that a target follows. Unlike Facebook, where mutual approval is required, this list includes all accounts the target follows. 

#### Bulk Lookup Feature
In early 2018, TweetBeaver introduced a bulk lookup feature that can process up to 15,000 Twitter usernames in a single query. This feature was tested extensively and proved to be highly effective. As a demonstration, the following accounts were entered into the bulk lookup utility:
- @InnocentOrg
- @IntelTechniques
- Inteltechniques
- jms_dot_py
- SultrvAsian
- HydeNS33k
- humanhacker
- WestCornfield

#### Finding Common Friends
Similar to finding common followers, this feature identifies the accounts that both targets follow. For example, TweetBeaver identified 57 common friends between two accounts. Some of these accounts include:

- Example Account 1
- Example Account 2

#### Downloading a User’s Followers List
This feature provides a list of accounts that follow the target. While it may not contain actual friends, all associated accounts should be investigated. The data can be downloaded as a CSV file, allowing for sorting by location or popularity, as shown in Figures 11.13 and 11.14.

#### Real-World Application
In a real-world scenario, this feature was used to investigate a suspicious Twitter account making violent threats against a celebrity. Despite the suspect sanitizing the account, the bulk lookup utility allowed the extraction of followers and followed accounts. Sorting by location revealed a strong presence in a specific Midwest city, and some of these accounts were geo-enabled, providing home addresses for two individuals.

#### Additional Insights
- **Total Audience Reach:** Determines whether the target has genuine followers or "fake" ones.
- **Total Impressions:** Provides an accurate measure of the target's audience size.
- **Total ReTweets:** Indicates how engaged the target's audience is with the content.
- **Total Audience Favorites:** Confirms engagement from the target's audience.
- **Tweet Sentiment:** Reveals the positive or negative tone of comments.
- **Tweet Types:** Distinguishes between original content and ReTweets of others.

By leveraging these features, investigators can gain valuable insights and narrow down their search for relevant information.
