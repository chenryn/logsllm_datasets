Find common followers of two accounts: This is a newer feature which can quickly identify people of interest 
based on co-targets. Consider the following. Twitter user jms_dot_py has been identified as a suspect in your 
embezzlement investigation. He seems to be very friendly with Twitter user humanhacker, and he once discussed 
tax evasion within public posts with this new second person of interest. Humanhacker has 33,000 followers and 
jms_dot_py has 12,500. There is no great way to look through these in order to find other suspects. However, 
TweetBeaver quickly identified the 371 people who follow both targets. This can be much more manageable, 
but is still a lot of data.
Find conversations between two users: Once you have identified two people of interest, you can focus on 
the conversations between them. You could replicate this with the previous Twitter operators, but this route 
presents a nice spreadsheet of the results. In my scenario, 1 located six conversations between me and 
jms_dot_py. Figure 11.12 displays one result.
Download a user’s friends list: This option collects a target's list of accounts that he or she follows. This is 
similar to a typical friends list on Facebook, but approvals on either end are not required.
In early 2018, TweetBeaver introduced the bulk lookup feature which can accept up to 15,000 Twitter 
usernames. This is quite impressive, and 1 have put it through many tests. This feature allows you to input 
numerous accounts within one query’. As a demonstration, I added every’ Twitter account mentioned in this 
chapter up to this point into the TweetBeaver bulk lookup utility’. The entry’ appeared as follows.

Find common friends of two accounts: Similar to the above, this only looks at the "friends" of each target. 
In other words, the people each target follows on Twitter. At the time of this writing, TweetBeaver identified 
the 57 people of interest. The following were two of the accounts.
Download a user’s followers list: This is a list of the people who follow the target on Twitter. This is less 
likely to contain actual friends, but all associated accounts should be investigated.

This immediately’ created a CSV spreadsheet which was downloaded to my’ computer. Figures 11.13 and 11.14 
display screen captures of the data. This gives me an immediate view into the accounts. If I had hundreds or 
thousands of Twitter usernames, this would allow me to sort by’ location or popularity’. 1 could also sort by’

Real World AppHcation: The day this feature was released, I was investigating a suspicious Twitter account 
associated with violent threats toward a celebrity. The suspect had sanitized the account which prohibited 
obtaining valid location data. However, the suspect had numerous followers and people he was following. Using 
TweetBeaver, 1 could extract these accounts easily and supply them to the bulk lookup utility. 1 then sorted his 
friends by location which revealed a strong presence in a specific Midwest city. Of those target accounts of 
interest, I could see that a few were Geo-enabled. This provided home addresses for two people.
