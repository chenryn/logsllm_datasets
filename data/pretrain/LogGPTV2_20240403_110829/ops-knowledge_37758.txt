User: What would be the optimal way to develop a basic graphical application for Windows based on a Python console script? It would be great if the solution could be distributed as a standalone directory, containing the .exe file.
Assistant: I would recommend that you use IronPython, which is Microsoft's implementation of Python for the .NET framework.
