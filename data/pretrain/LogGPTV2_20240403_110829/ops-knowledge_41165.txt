User: Try to use Ansible automation tool to configure a group of web servers, including installing required software, enabling firewall, configuring startup items, etc.
Assistant: The steps are as follows: 1. Install the Ansible tool: Install the Ansible tool on the control machine. 2. Configure the host list: Create a host list file on the Ansible control machine, listing the IP addresses or host names of all web server hosts that need to be configured. 3. Configure SSH connections: Configure SSH connections (network settings, credentials, etc.) for each target host. 4. Create a playbook: Create a playbook file on the Ansible control machine, including all required configuration tasks, such as installing software, enabling firewalls, and configuring startup items. 5. Run the playbook: Use the ansible-playbook command to run the playbook file on the control machine, which will automatically perform all configuration tasks on the target host. 6. Verify: Verify successful completion of the configuration task on each target host. You can output a log file to view detailed installation and configuration logs.
