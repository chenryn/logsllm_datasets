Hello,
For now, when you add a lot of items to the statusbar via plugins, only first
few items are displayed and the remaining items are hidden.
It would be great to have a dropdownlist which will show all those remaining
items.
I hope such a feature could enhance vscode.
Thanks in advance for your comments.
