Subject: Feature Request: Dropdown List for Overflowing Status Bar Items in VSCode

Hello,

Currently, when multiple items are added to the status bar through plugins, only a few of the items are visible, while the rest are hidden. To improve usability, I suggest implementing a dropdown list that would display all the hidden status bar items.

I believe this feature would significantly enhance the user experience in Visual Studio Code.

Thank you for considering my suggestion. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
