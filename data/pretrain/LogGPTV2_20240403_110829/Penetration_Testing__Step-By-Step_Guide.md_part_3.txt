methods. There are many methods defined by RFCs and several
vendor specific methods and new proposals exist. EAP is not a wire
protocol; instead, it only defines message formats. Each protocol
that uses EAP defines a way to encapsulate EAP messages within
that protocol's messages.
Note
Decrypting Wi-Fi frames will not show all the traffic as a clear text,
because Some traffic is encrypted from the source or application.
Example is https traffic which is encrypted by the browser application
and then encrypted again by the Wi-Fi protocol, when the Wi-Fi
frame is decrypted the result is https encrypted data.

2.8. Fake access Point
By creating Free Wi-Fi Access point or fake access point hackers can easily
attract people to connect to their Access point, especially in public places that
have open Wi-Fi networks, when a victim connect to Fake Access Point he
will get full access to internet but all of his traffic is passing through the
attacker PC. The attacker can see all the victim unencrypted traffic, can
present the victim with fake login screen to steal his credentials and can see
victim emails.
Fake access Point can be created very easily using Alfa card or any wireless
card that can be set to monitor mode and can inject packets , there are many
software tools available to allow us crate access point such as Wifipumbkin3
tool.
Exercise 8 Creating Fake Access point using Wifipumpkin3
1. Download and install wifipumpkin3 from GitHub
#git clone https://github.com/P0cL4bs/wifipumpkin3.git
#apt install libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential
#apt install python3-pyqt5
#cd wifipumpkin3
#python3 setup.py install
If installation is successful you get the following message at the end of
installation
“Finished processing dependencies for wifipumpkin3==1.0.0”
Before starting Wifipumpkin3 make sure both networks adapters are
running , the Alfa card should be in managed mode and should not be
connected to any Wi-Fi network
S_E_Oblako
2. Start wifipumpkin3
#wifipumpkin3 -i wlan0

2.9. Securing Wireless Network
Now that we know how to test the security of all known wireless encryption
(WEP/WPA/WPA2), it is relatively easy to secure our networks against these
attacks if we know all the weaknesses that can be used by hackers.
- WEP: WEP is an old encryption, and it’s really weak, as we seen in the
course there are a number of methods that can be used to crack this
encryption regardless of the strength of the password and even if there is
nobody connected to the network. These attacks are possible because of
the way WEP works, we discussed the weakness of WEP and how it can
be cracked, some of these methods even allow you to crack the key in a
few minutes.
- WPA/WPA2: WPA and WPA2 are similar, the only difference between
them is the algorithm used to encrypt the information but both
encryptions work in the same way. WPA/WPA2 can be cracked in two
ways:
If WPS feature is enabled then there is a high chance of
obtaining the key regardless of its complexity, this can be done
by exploiting a weakness in the WPS feature. WPS is used to
allow users to connect to their wireless network without
entering the key, this is done by pressing a WPS button on both
the router and the device that they want to connect, the
authentication works using an eight digit pin, hackers can brute
force this pin in relatively short time (in an average of 10
hours), once they get the right pin they can use a tool called
reaver to reverse engineer the pin and get the key, this is all
possible due to the fact that the WPS feature uses an easy pin
(only 8 characters and only contains digits), so it's not a
weakness in WPA/WPA2, it's a weakness in a feature that can
be enabled on routers that use WPA/WPA2 which can be
exploited to get the actual WPA/WPA2 key.
If WPS is not enabled, then the only way to crack WPA/WPA2
is using a dictionary attack, in this attack a list of passwords
(dictionary) is compared against a file (handshake file) to check
if any of the passwords is the actual key for the network, so if
the password does not exist in the wordlist then the attacker
will not be able to find the password.
S_E_Oblako
Conclusion:
- WEP encryption is an old encryption method and have major
vulnerability and should not be used at all, as it can be cracked easily
regardless of the complexity of the password and even if there is
nobody connected to the network.
- Use WPA2 with a complex password, make sure the password
contains small letters, capital letters, symbols, and numbers.
- Enterprises that have Active Directory and wireless controller should
integrate the access to the Wi-Fi with Active directory so no shared
Wi-Fi password is used.
- WPS feature is disabled in Wi-Fi Routers as it can be used to crack
your complex WPA2 key by brute-forcing the easy WPS pin.

Post Connection Attacks
After gaining access to the network through Wi-Fi, hackers will
move to the next stage of the attack which is discovering the
networks and looking for systems, Databases and application
vulnerabilities, in this chapter you will learn tools to discover the
network such as Nmap tool, launching man in the middle attacks
and more.
S_E_Oblako
3. Post Connection Attacks
After Gaining access to the network we are going to move to discovering the
network and what devices are connected to the network, we have three
methods to discover the network.
3.1. Network discovering
- Network discover command tell us all the devices that connected to the
network and the type and IP address of the device.
The wireless card should be in client mode and have IP address from the
network
Exercise 9: Using Network Discovery tool netdiscover
#netdiscover -i wlan0 -r 192.168.0.1/24
S_E_Oblako
Exercise 10: Using Network discovery tool arp-scan
- if you are facing problems with netdiscover (with Kali 2020.2 version
netdiscover is not stable and sometimes does not show any devices in
the scan ).
- arp-scan does the same job and it comes loaded part of kali
- To use arp-scan tool
#arp-scan –help
#arp-scan -I wlan0 192.168.0.0/24
Repeat the above command more than one time because of the nature of
arp protocol
3.2. Using NMAP tool
- Nmap is a network discovery tool that can be used to gather detailed
information about any client in the network, Nmap is a very large tool
and have many uses in penetration testing and there are dedicated
courses to teach Nmap.
- We shall have a look at some of Nmap features to discover connected
clients and gather more information about them.
- We are going to use Zenmap version of Nmap (Gui based Nmap tool).
- Prior to Kali version 2020.1 Zenmap comes part of Kali distribution and
no need to install it.
- Download zenmap
# cd Downloads
#wget https://nmap.org/dist/zenmap-7.80-1.noarch.rpm
S_E_Oblako
- Convert .rpm file using Alien to a .deb file
#apt-get update
#apt install alien
#alien #zenmap-7.80-1.noarch.rpm
- Install using dpkg
#dpkg -I zenmap_7.80_all.deb
S_E_Oblako
- Start zenmap
#zenmap
S_E_Oblako
Exercise 11: using Nmap
- In Kali type the following command to start Nmap tool
#zenmap
- In the Target field enter the IP address or a subnet as shown in the
screenshot below
S_E_Oblako
S_E_Oblako
Note
The above exercise is to make you familiar with NMAP tool. Nmap
is main tool that used in all vulnerability assessment tools that
hackers start with to discover open ports in servers. Open port means
a service that could be exploited and lead to server penetration. We
are going to use NMAP in other penetration tests throughout this
book.
S_E_Oblako
3.3. Man in the Middle Attacks (MiTM)
Man in the middle Attack is one in which the attacker secretly intercepts and
relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating
directly with each other. MiTM attackers pose a serious threat to online
security because it gives the attacker the ability to capture and manipulate
sensitive information in real-time. The attack is a type of eavesdropping
(Eavesdropping is the unauthorized real-time interception of a private
communication, such as a phone call, instant message, videoconference, or
fax transmission. The term eavesdrop derives from the practice of standing
under the eaves of a house, listening to conversations inside) in which the
entire conversation is controlled by attacker. Sometimes referred to as session
hijacking attack, MiTM has a strong chance of success when the attacker can
impersonate each party to the satisfaction of the other.
A common method of executing a MiTM attack involve distributing malware
that provide attacker with access to the user’s Web browser and the data it
sends and receives during transactions and conversations. Once the attacker
has control, he can redirect users to fake site that looks like the site the user is
expecting to reach. The attacker can then create a connection to the real site
and act as a proxy to read, insert and modify the traffic between the user and
the legitimate site. Online banking and e-commerce sites are frequently the
target of MiTM attacks so that the attacker can capture login credentials and
other sensitive data.
Most cryptographic protocols include some of endpoint authentication
specifically, are made to prevent MiTM attacks. For example, the transport
layer security (TLS) protocol can be required to authenticate one or both
parties using mutually trusted certificate authority. Unless users take heed
warnings when suspected certificate is presented, however, MiTM attack can
still be carried with fake or forged certificates.
MiTM attacker can also exploit vulnerabilities in wireless router’s security
caused by weak or default passwords. For example, a malicious router, also
called evil twin or fake access point can be setup in a public place like a café
or hotel to intercept information traveling through the router.
Type of MiTM attacks:
ARP spoofing
DNS Spoofing
STP mangling
S_E_Oblako
DHCP Spoofing
ICMP redirection
And more
3.4. ARP Spoofing
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is very essential for computers
communications as it tell the client device who is the router, the protocol is
not secure, the client will accept any ARP packets saying that “I am the
router“, and start sending packets to that destination, this weakness in the
protocol is used to start ARP spoofing . ARP Spoofing is extremely hard to
protect against if the attacker has the wireless password.
S_E_Oblako
ARP Protocol main security issues:
- Each ARP Request/response is trusted.
- Client can accept response even if it did not sent request.
ARP Spoofing
We are going to do MiMT attack using APR spoofing by telling a client that
we are the router, in the same time we tell the Router that we are the clients.
Exercise 12: ARP Spoofing using arpspoof tool
- In this Exercise we are going to use the virtual environment that we
created in virtual box and we are going to spoof the Windows machine
from Kali Linux and let it direct all its packets to Kali Linux machine.
- Go to virtual Box and make sure that both Kali Linux and Windows
machine shows the following
S_E_Oblako
- Start both Kali and Windows virtual machines.
- In this exercise we are going to do arpspoof telling the windows
machine that kali is the router and another arpsoof command to tell the
router that Kali is the windows machine.
- Then we can use wireshark in Kali to see the traffic between the
windows machine and the router because the traffic is going through
Kali machine .
- In windows machine run the following command ( to see ARP table)
arp -a
- In Kali install arpspoof tool (dsniff)
#apt install dsniff
S_E_Oblako
- In Kali open terminal windows and type:
#arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.0.2.6 -r 10.0.2.1
-i = is the interface in Kali linux that we are going to use to
make MiMT attack
-t = target machine IP address
-r = Router IP address
- Go to windows machine and run command arp -a again
S_E_Oblako
- Now we need to enable IP forwarding in Kali machine to allow it to
pass Windows machines packets to the router.
- Do not close the arpspoof terminals
- Open new terminal windows and type the following command
#echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
- To Monitor the traffic start wireshark and start capturing
- In Windows 10 machine go to http site
S_E_Oblako
In Kali check wireshark and filter for http
S_E_Oblako
3.5. MiTM with Bettercap tool
BetterCAP is a powerful, flexible, and portable tool created to perform
various types of MITM attacks against a network, manipulate HTTP, HTTPS
and TCP traffic in real time, sniff for credentials and much more.
There are a lot of materials online, especially from the official bettercap
website, which document how the tool is used and some of the improvements
that have been done to it over the years..
Betterrcap website: www.bettercap.org
Exercise 13: Installing Bettercap tool
1. Start Kali terminal and update Kali Linux
#apt-get update
#apt-get install bettercap
2. Start bettercap by typing
#bettercap -iface eth0 (eth0 is the Kali interface that we are going to use for
Bettercap)
3- Type help to see the commands that can be used and the modules inside
bettercap tool and the status of each module if is running or not.
S_E_Oblako
4- To see how to use a module you can type help followed by the module
name
S_E_Oblako
5- For example if I want to see how to use net.recon module
6- Turn on the net.recon module then start Windows machine , you will see
that the module will discover the Windows machine.
7- Net.probe module send probe packets to all of the subnet that the
Bettercap reside on and net.recon record the responses from clients in a
nice table and enabling net.probe module will automatically start
net.recon module
8- Type help
S_E_Oblako
9- Type net.show
Exercise 14: ARP Spoofing with Bettercap
1. Start bettercap
2. Start arp spoof module
#bettercap -iface eth0
>help arp.spoof
S_E_Oblako
3. Set the arp.spoof parameter to fullduplex to monitor both, the
victim machine and the router
4. Set the target victim machine to be arp spoofed (windows machine)
S_E_Oblako
Note
you can change any module in better cap the same way, just type set
followed by the module name and then the parameter as shown in the
help.
You can use tab to autocomplete the parameter name.
5. Turn the module on
6. Go to Windows machine and type arp -a
7. To see the traffic of Windows machine you need to start another
Bettercap module which is net.sniff
>net.sniff on
S_E_Oblako
8. Stop arp.spoof module
S_E_Oblako
Exercise 15: Intercepting HTTP traffic with Bettercap
HTTP traffic is not encrypted so when Man in the middle attack initiated
against a target computer and that target is using http traffic to login to a site,
all his traffic will visible to the hacker running MiMT attack even he can see
his username and password. In the following exercise we are going to use
Bettercap to intercept traffic from virtual Windows machine. when the
windows user login to http website we will see his credentials because it is
not encrypted.
1. Start Kali and setup bettercap as shown in the screen shot below
2. In Windows machine open web browser and go to the following website
http://testing-ground.scraping.pro/login
login as admin and password 12345
S_E_Oblako
3. Look at the Bettercap output in Kali
S_E_Oblako
S_E_Oblako
Exercise 16: Automating Bettercap attacks using Caplets
Bettercap has a feature called “caplet” , this feature allow automation of any
job we need to do in Bettercap by typing the series of commands that
required to do the job in text editor then save the file under the root directory
with .cap extension. In the following exercise we are going to create .cap file
for the previous exercise of arp spoofing and calling the .cap file from
bettercap when we start Bttercap.
1. Open mousepad text editor in Kali
2. Inside mousepad type all the commands that entered in the
previous exercise in order to start arp spoofing and sniff the
result.
3. Save the file to the /root directory
4. Make sure that you exit previous Bettercap session by typing exit
5. Type #betttercap -iface eth0 -caplet arpspoof.cap
S_E_Oblako
6. To make sure that arp.spoof run with all required modules enabled
type >help
S_E_Oblako
7. To see all the available caplets that come with Better cap
#cd /usr/share/bettercap/caplets
8. We need to move the arpspoof caplet that we created to
/ usr/share/bettercap/caplets
S_E_Oblako
9. Modify the arpspoof caplet file to have more sniffing capabilities by
adding option to sniff local
#mousepad arpSpoof.cap
Inside the file add the following line
Set net.sniff.local true
