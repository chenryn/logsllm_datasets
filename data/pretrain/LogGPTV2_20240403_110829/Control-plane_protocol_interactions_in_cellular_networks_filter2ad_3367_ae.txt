6.2 Fate Sharing for Voice and Data
The instance S5 is an operational problem in dual-domain op-
erations. In our experiments, we keep observing fate-sharing on
transmission rates between PS and CS domains. When both PS
and CS are accessing the 3G network on the phone, the PS data
rate decreases signiﬁcantly, compared with the case of accessing
3GPS only. This is due to improper cross-domain (CS/PS) cou-
pling between PS and CS in 3G. It is implemented by carriers, and
does not appear to be a design slip in the standards.
Figure 9 plots the downlink and uplink speed when the PS ser-
vice is enabled with/without the CS call at different hours of a day.
When both services are concurrently enabled, downlink and up-
link data rates (expect the uplink rate in OP-I) decrease. It seems
reasonable since PS and CS are competing for the shared radio re-
source. However, given that the best 3G CS voice is 12.2kbps [11],
the actual PS data rate degrades beyond expectation (a small or
mild drop expected). The downlink decline is up to 3.5-5.8 Mbps,
about 73.9% in OP-I and 74.8% in OP-II. The uplink speed drop in
OP-II reaches 96.1% (for OP-I, one 51.1% drop observed).
We ﬁgure out that, the large rate drop in PS is due to the inap-
propriate cross-domain channel sharing. In general, CS voice and
PS data have different requirements. The CS trafﬁc requires high
resilience and low loss to ensure timely delivery and reduce voice
message retransmission. It thus prefers the more robust, low-rate
modulation scheme (e.g., 16QAM). In contrast, PS trafﬁc prefers
high data rate for faster access. It thus prefers high-rate modulation
(e.g., 64QAM). Our protocol trace analysis shows that, both carri-
ers conﬁgure the phone via the RRC protocol. The phone transfers
both CS and PS trafﬁc over the shared channel and apply the same
modulation scheme. The modulation scheme is chosen so that the
CS trafﬁc is satisﬁed ﬁrst, at the cost of PS rate degradation. Fig-
ure 10 gives an example trace collected in OP-I. We see that, before
the voice call is made, the used modulation scheme is 64QAM, thus
offering downlink speed up to 21Mbps. Once the voice call starts,
both OP-I and OP-II disable 64QAM. The highest-rate modula-
tion turns 16QAM, thus reducing the theoretical downlink speed to
11Mbps. The user thus suffers from large rate drop in its data ser-
vice. Certainly, a tradeoff between performance and radio resource
control exists. Sending CS and PS trafﬁc over the shared channel
may reduce carriers’ resource waste [23]. However, it is achieved at
the cost of large PS rate decline. The above measurements indicate
that current tradeoff is not a good practice from users’ perspective.
A different sharing scheme may yield better results. Consider
each shared channel used by multiple users allow each to adopt
3G Failures Propagated to 4G System
his own modulation scheme; The modulation scheme may change
over time due to varying signal strength. Also, one device can use
multiple channels. Instead of coupling the CS and PS trafﬁc from
the same device on the shared channel, we can cluster PS sessions
from multiple devices and let them share the same channel while
CS sessions are grouped together and sent over the shared channel
using the same modulation scheme. An alternative approach is to
allow CS and PS to adopt their own modulation scheme. This way,
diverse requirements of CS and PS trafﬁc can both be met.
Insight 5: When two domains have different goals and properties,
their services should be decoupled as possible. Otherwise at least
one domain’s demands can be sacriﬁced.
6.3
S6 is a cross-system coupling case found from our experiments.
The involved protocols are MM in 3G and EMM in 4G. The usage
scenario is to make phone calls in 4G from the LTE phone. In this
setting, CSFB is again used. The 4G carrier thus uses its legacy 3G
system for the call. During the inter-system changes due to CSFB,
location updates are performed in both 3G and 4G. However, such
updates may fail. In both OP-I and OP-II, the error message on
location area update failure in 3G is propagated to 4G. The 4G user
may consequently become out of service, and the operator gains
no beneﬁt. Note that, location update is triggered during periodic
refresh or CSFB calls, in addition to user mobility. The problem
appears to be partly due to improper operational practice, and partly
due to the standards that fail to specify the procedure.
Two location updates in 3G are performed when using CSFB for
voice calls. The ﬁrst update is needed after the 4G→3G switching
once the call starts. It is initiated by the device. The standards state
that this update action can be deferred until the call completes [5];
this helps to reduce the latency when serving the call in 3G. When
the call completes, the second location update in 4G is done after
the device switches back to 4G. It is done by the network. The
update is ﬁrst processed by MME in 4G, which relays the update
request to MSC in 3G. Therefore, based on the standards, two lo-
cation updates in 3G are activated.
Among the two location updates, one is deemed redundant. It
yields no beneﬁt, but incurs penalty. Which speciﬁc update does
harm depends on the carrier. In OP-I, the ﬁrst update hurts. The
reason is that the delayed update is done once the call terminates.
Since the inter-system switching back to 4G is fast, the device-
initiated ﬁrst update is disrupted. This incomplete update status is
propagated from 3G to 4G, which sends the device a message with
error type “implicitly detach”. Upon receiving the error, the device
enters the “out-of-service” state. Note that the 3G system already
completes the second update, and the ﬁrst one is unnecessary. In
OP-II, the second update causes damage. The ﬁrst update is com-
pleted ﬁrst, since it takes more time for the carrier to switch from
3G back to 4G. The success of the ﬁrst update may trigger MSC in
3G to refuse the second update that is relayed by MME to 3G. It
thus replies to 4G MME with an error type “MSC temporarily not
reachable”. A detach request is sent by 4G to the device, and user
enters the “out-of-service” state.

Note that both carriers make their decision with plausible ex-
cuses.
If location update in 3G fails, it does harm the 4G LTE
user. The user may miss incoming calls. Such incoming calls can-
not reach the mobile user if its location update fails. This is why
both carriers share and act on the error messages regarding loca-
tion update failures in 3G and 4G. However, this error-handling
process should be conﬁned between 3G MSC and 4G MME inside
the network infrastructure. Indeed, they can collaborate to resolve
the failures. The error-handling actions should not be directed and
exposed to the device. This malpractice can be avoided.
Insight 6: For the same functions in different networks, they should
be coordinated to reduce the conﬂict. Particularly, the internal fail-
ure from one network should not be propagated to another network.
7. USER STUDY
To assess the real-world impact, we conduct two-week user study
with 20 volunteers, including students, faculty members, engineers
and technology-unsavvy people. 12 people use 4G-capable phones,
while others use 3G-only phones. We observe 190 CSFB calls,
146 CS calls in 3G, 436 inter-system switches (380 switches are
caused by 190 CSFB calls), and 30 attaches induced by (re)starting
user devices or auto recovery from the out-of-service state. Table 5
summarizes the results for six instances S1-S6.
S1 (§5.1): In S1, a user in 3G fails to switch to 4G if its PDP con-
text is deactivated. In our study, we observe 218 4G→3G switches
due to CSFB calls (190), user mobility (10) and carrier operations6
(8). 129 of them are made while mobile data is ON, and 4 S1 events
are observed. This results in about 3.1% (4/129) for S1 events in
case of 4G→3G switches with enabled mobile data.
S2 (§5.2): S2 results in the attach failure. 30 attaches are ob-
served but none of them fails. It implies that S2 rarely occurs. This
can be due to that all are performed in the area with good coverage
(the weakest signal strength is -95dBm).
S3 (§5.3): In S3, users do not immediately return to 4G when a
CSFB call ends. Among 190 CSFB calls, 103 (39 in OP-I and 64
in OP-II) are made while mobile data is enabled. Table 6 shows
the duration in 3G after their CSFB calls end. OP-I users usu-
ally switch back to 4G within 3 seconds. It is because OP-I uses
“RRC Connection Release with redirect,” which can be triggered at
RRC Non-IDLE state. However, OP-II users get stuck in 3G much
longer because OP-II performs “inter-system cell selection,” which
occurs only at RRC IDLE state. We note that all are shorter than
that in validation experiments. This is because the duration of get-
ting stuck in 3G depends on the lifetime of ongoing data sessions.
S4 (§6.1): We mainly consider the HOL blocking for 3G CS
calls. We check whether there is any location area update done in
1.2 s right after the outgoing call starts, because this update takes at
least 1.2 s to complete (§6.1). We observe 79 outgoing calls out of
146 CS calls in 3G. Six (i.e., 7.6%) are affected. In case of longer
location area updates (>1.2 s), the ratio is larger.
6Note that it may be still triggered by user mobility. However, we
cannot justify it since GPS is not always turned on by participants.

Figure 11: Solution overview.
S5 (§6.2): We examine how often CS calls affect PS data trafﬁc
and how much data is affected during a call. It is observed that
77.4% 3G CS calls (113 out of 146) happen while data trafﬁc is
ongoing. For these calls, the average duration is 67s, and the av-
erage affected data volume is 368KB. Most calls (109/113) affect
the data volume less than 550KB, whereas the remaining four calls
have impact on more than 4MB data (the largest one is 18.5MB).
S6: (§6.3): In addition to S1, the failure of location update re-
quired by CSFB calls make the users fail to switch back to 4G after
a CSFB call. It turns out to happen in 5 out of 190 calls (2.6%).
This study with small samples may not accurately quantify the
real-world impact and can be further improved with more partici-
pants. The result partly conﬁrms that current cellular networks are
largely successful. However, it also shows that the found issues
do occur in our daily life and affect our real mobile usage. More-
over, though some issues arise with small or negligible probability
during normal usage, they may be manipulated and inﬂated if ma-
licious exploits are launched against cellular networks or users.
8. SOLUTION
We now present our solution, as shown in Figure 11. It has three
modules of layer extension, domain decoupling and cross-system
coordination. We next elaborate on each component.
Layer Extension. We propose a slim layer with reliable transfer
for the out-of-sequence signaling in §5.2 at the EMM, and then par-
allelize independent operations in §6.1. In the former, the slim layer
is inserted between EMM and RRC. Its reliable transfer ensures the
end-to-end in-order signal exchange between the phone and MME.
To be compatible with the current system, it bridges the interfaces
between EMM and RRC and encapsulates the information of reli-
able transfer function. For the latter,
location update should be
decoupled from the CS or PS service request for MM and GMM,
respectively. Each of MM/GMM maintains two parallel threads.
One is for the location update, whereas the other is for remaining
functions including the outgoing CS/PS service request. The out-
going CS/PS service request is given higher priority than location
update, since the former procedure implicitly does the latter.
Domain Decoupling.
Two domains are coupled at the RRC
layer. Therefore, we propose a domain decoupling module in RRC.
It aims to eliminate the unnecessary interference (e.g., triggered
events in §5.3, modulation downgrade in §6.2) from one domain
to another. For the triggered events, one domain should not be
constrained by another domain. That is, when CSFB is triggered
in the CS domain, it should perform 3G→4G switch when the call
ends. If the switch condition is satisﬁed (e.g., 4G is available), the
switch will be executed, not blocked by the operations in the PS
domain. To this end, the base station adds a CSFB tag to assist the
subsequent inter-system switching.
To avoid the modulation downgrade, the 3G RRC can decouple
PS and CS services by assigning different channels. Therefore,
PS and CS services can be transmitted with different modulation
schemes (e.g., 64QAM for PS and 16QAM for CS). To enable the
232decoupling, we distinguish CS/PS trafﬁc and assign radio resource
independently. Both can be satisﬁed within the current standard
and system. First, Radio Link Control (RLC, refer to Figure 1) can
exploit the source of trafﬁc (different modules and interfaces used
for CS and PS) to differentiate voice and data trafﬁc. Second, the
standard allows to assign one device multiple radio channels, each
of which can be conﬁgured separately.
Cross-system Coordination.
The similar functions in differ-
ent systems should be coordinated because they seek to serve the
similar purpose, despite using (slightly) different system-speciﬁc
approaches. The key is to (1) share the information with each other
and (2) collaborate to enforce proper operation. Speciﬁcally, 4G
EPS bearer context and PDP context are equivalently critical to en-
