### Description
I have following form types: `ContactType.php` and `SendContactType.php`.  
I have following entities with constraints: `Contact.php` and
`SendContact.php`.
They code for theose files can be seen at: https://gist.github.com/1199860.
The problem is with the `something` field of `ContactType`.  
When that field is something simple (type `text` for example) everything
works.  
If the value is shorter that 3 the error gets added to field's error list.
But when that field is of type `repeated` something gets broken. When
assertion  
fails the error gets added to the outermost form instead of "something" field.
Basically with this code:
            $form = $this->get('form.factory')->create(new SendContactType());
            $form->bindRequest($request);
            if (!$form->isValid()) {
                var_dump($form->getErrors());
            }
A non-empty array is unexpectedly dumped with the error/message that shouldn't
be there but down the tree.
### My analysis
Basically what happens in this case is that the `propertyPath` put together
during validation graph walking doesn't match  
any of the patterns later generated in
`DegelatingValidator::buildFormPathMapping()` etc. This happens  
when a form embeds another form containing a type `repeated` field.
The propertyPath generated for `something` field is `string(32)
"children[contact].data.something"`.  
The patterns DelegatingValidator generates and tries to match it against:
    string(25) "/^children\.data\.(?!\w)/"
    string(30) "/^children\.data\.agree(?!\w)/"
    string(36) "/^children\[contact\]\.data\.(?!\w)/"
    string(49) "/^children\[contact\]\[something\]\.data\.(?!\w)/"
    string(54) "/^children\[contact\]\[something\]\.data\.first(?!\w)/"
    string(55) "/^children\[contact\]\[something\]\.data\.second(?!\w)/"
    string(41) "/^children\[contact\]\[something\](?!\w)/"
    string(43) "/^children\[contact\]\.data\.message(?!\w)/"
    string(28) "/^children\[contact\](?!\w)/"
The last one in this list is first that matches and that's why the error gets
added to form, but it really should match earlier.
