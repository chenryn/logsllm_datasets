User: How to optimize SQL query performance? Please provide some SQL query performance optimization methods and techniques.
Assistant: Methods and techniques for SQL query performance optimization include: 1. Write high-performance SQL query statements. Use indexes, avoid table joins, avoid subqueries, use appropriate aggregate functions, etc. 2. Use appropriate indexes. Indexes can improve query performance, but too many or inappropriate indexes can affect performance. 3. Optimize the structure of the table. The unreasonable structure of the table will affect the query performance, for example, too many fields will increase the query time. 4. Use a partition table. Partitioned tables can improve query performance, especially on large datasets. 5. Optimize the functions in the query statement. Both aggregate functions and scalar functions affect query performance, and you need to choose an appropriate function. 6. Avoid subqueries. Subqueries will be slower, try converting subqueries into JOIN statements. 7. Optimize the size of the query result set. Query only the data you need, avoiding unnecessary columns and rows. 8. Make full use of the database cache. Database caching can reduce disk access and improve query performance. 9. Use an appropriate database connection pool. Connection pooling reduces the overhead of creating and destroying connections. 10. Regularly maintain the database. Clean up useless data, optimize tables, rebuild indexes, and more.
