research, these slides will most likely change.

Some Common Questions
What is a hardware trojan?
Why should I care about this?
Doesn’t my anti-virus protect against this?
Why bother with hardware when software is so easy?

Some Answers
We deﬁne Hardware Trojans to be malicious alteration of 
hardware, that could, under speciﬁc conditions, result in functional 
changes to the system. 
Most products will go through multiple locations before it reaches 
the consumer (ie Design - US, HDL - Israel, Fab - China) and 
attacks can occur anywhere along this line
Most security practices assume the hardware is secure or trusted
Hardware can be easy to manipulate and disguise
Active TEMPEST anyone?

Quick Scenario (or is it?)
New “super secure” smart card comes out
Banks adopt as main method of authentication, wide 
adoption takes place
DOD CAC, EZ-PASS, etc
Device weak against 0-day attack
accidental? intentionally inserted? how did it get there?
Banks confronted by bad guys
Admit ﬂaw in chip - people lose faith in system, banks lose money
Deny ﬂaw in chip – hope no one else ﬁnds out, banks lose money
Pay blackmail – fund/encourage further attacks, no guarantee of good faith

Hardware Trojans
DC16 Demonstration of Hardware Trojans (Kiamilev/
Hoover)
Optical Trojan - Blink LED faster than human eye can 
see, optical to audio reads out key, data, password, etc
Thermal Trojan - Heat up and cool component by 
running electricity to it, creating changing IR signature
RF Trojan - Run current through a wire or pin creating 
EM waves that can be picked up by off the shelf radio

Our Power Trojans
Use the power lines to leak data
Similar to Barisani/Bianco’s research but still unique
Offers bidirectional communication
Does anyone monitor power lines?
Other examples of the concept: X10, PowerLine 
Ethernet, Broadband over Power, etc
7
Crash course in Electricity
Voltage = Current * Resistance (Ohm’s Law, V=IR)
Power = Current * Voltage (Power Law, P=IV)
AC is alternating current (60Hz US, 50Hz Europe)
DC is direct current (think batteries)
Power line uses AC, Power supply converts AC to DC
8
Getting Data Out - Part 1
Consuming power means more power draw on AC line
Increasing load on CPU increases power usage
Modulate load on AC line by modulating CPU usage
Measure power line and read in signal
Data successfully exﬁltrated
9
Getting Data In - Part 1
PSU provides DC at: +12V,+5V,+3.3V,-12V,-5V
Conversion: 120VAC=>12VDC=>5VDC=>3.3VDC
12V rail poorly regulated, used for motors on drives
5V and 3.3V rails highly regulated
12V rail effected by variations in 120VAC
Modulate with VARIAC, read out 12V using 
motherboard sensors

Faraday’s Cage - the horror!
A Faraday Cage blocks out all external static electric 
ﬁelds
Keeps out signals (ex: Wiﬁ, Cellphones, Radio, GPS, 
etc)
Used in Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility 
to make “TEMPEST” proof
Forgot one thing...everything needs power
Can’t run off batteries forever ;)

Demo
Visit http://www.cvorg.ece.udel.edu for video 
demos created that will be conducted live during 
the talk.  We will also post the demos we 
conduct during out talk.

Ampliﬁed Active TEMPESTs
Coin new phrases: passive and active TEMPEST to 
describe their creation
Passive TEMPEST: Traditional TEMPEST attack, 
accidental side effects of technology 
Active TEMPEST: Actively created through the 
modiﬁcation of hardware to create TEMPEST 
conditions
Think about all the TEMPEST attacks ampliﬁed...
13
Can we amplify ours?
14
Why yes, we can! How?
15
With a little help from a few 
discreet electronic bits
16
Getting Data Out - Part 2
Modify Power Supply
Attach microcontroller to the AC line
Connect microcontroller to system
Use 60Hz signal as carrier and do crazy modulation
Make it appear as noise, truly disguising itself
Pass data from PSU to CPU disguised as fan speed 
sensor or by modulating internal power rails
17
Getting Data In - Part 2
Use same setup as described previously
Add small circuit to demodulate signal (more capacitors 
and resistors? oh no! They might just ﬁt in with the rest)
Fan speed sensor right? Should connect back and 
report data somehow
Connect microcontroller to the PSU’s fan connector
Data leaks in using sensors again by reporting varying 
RPMs to motherboard sensor

Do you get the not so 
hidden message?
pay attention! don’t make us bring out tHe bIg guns!
people should take a Look aT hardware, it’s not that 
scary
trusted coMputIng, needs a serious looK
lEt’s not live through a battleSTAr galactica scenario...
More effort could help defeAT software attacks
you can TRUST us, we’re professionals (just ask DOD)
I just spot a fed! now can you? :)
