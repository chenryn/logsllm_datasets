### Common Questions
1. **What is a hardware trojan?**
2. **Why should I care about this?**
3. **Doesn’t my anti-virus protect against this?**
4. **Why bother with hardware when software is so easy?**

---

### Answers
- **Definition:** A hardware trojan is a malicious alteration of hardware that can result in functional changes to the system under specific conditions.
- **Supply Chain Vulnerability:** Products often pass through multiple locations (e.g., design in the US, HDL in Israel, fabrication in China), providing multiple points for potential attacks.
- **Security Assumptions:** Most security practices assume that hardware is secure or trusted, which is not always the case.
- **Ease of Manipulation:** Hardware can be easily manipulated and disguised.
- **Active TEMPEST:** An example of a potential threat that can be amplified through hardware modifications.

---

### Scenario
- **New "Super Secure" Smart Card Released:** Banks adopt it as their primary authentication method, leading to widespread use.
- **Vulnerability Discovered:** The device is weak against zero-day attacks.
- **Possible Scenarios:**
  - **Admit Flaw:** Loss of consumer trust and financial losses for banks.
  - **Deny Flaw:** Risk of further discovery and financial losses.
  - **Pay Blackmail:** Encourages further attacks with no guarantee of resolution.

### DC16 Demonstration of Hardware Trojans
- **Optical Trojan:** Blinks an LED faster than the human eye can see, allowing optical-to-audio data exfiltration.
- **Thermal Trojan:** Heats and cools components by running electricity, creating a changing IR signature.
- **RF Trojan:** Generates EM waves by running current through a wire or pin, which can be picked up by off-the-shelf radios.

---

### Our Power Trojans
- **Concept:** Use power lines to leak data.
- **Uniqueness:** Similar to Barisani/Bianco’s research but with bidirectional communication.
- **Monitoring:** Power lines are often unmonitored.
- **Examples:** X10, PowerLine Ethernet, Broadband over Power, etc.

---

### Crash Course in Electricity
- **Ohm’s Law:** Voltage = Current * Resistance (V=IR)
- **Power Law:** Power = Current * Voltage (P=IV)
- **AC vs. DC:** AC is alternating current (60Hz in the US, 50Hz in Europe), while DC is direct current (e.g., batteries).
- **Power Conversion:** Power lines use AC, which is converted to DC by power supplies.

---

### Getting Data Out - Part 1
- **Principle:** Increasing CPU load increases power usage, modulating the load on the AC line.
- **Process:** Measure the power line and read the signal to exfiltrate data.

---

### Getting Data In - Part 1
- **Power Supply Voltages:** +12V, +5V, +3.3V, -12V, -5V.
- **Conversion Path:** 120VAC => 12VDC => 5VDC => 3.3VDC.
- **Regulation:** 12V rail is poorly regulated, used for motors; 5V and 3.3V rails are highly regulated.
- **Modulation:** Modulate the 120VAC using a VARIAC and read out the 12V using motherboard sensors.

### Faraday’s Cage - The Horror!
- **Function:** Blocks external static electric fields and signals (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellphones, radio, GPS).
- **Use Case:** Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) to make it “TEMPEST” proof.
- **Limitation:** Everything needs power, and batteries cannot run indefinitely.

### Amplified Active TEMPESTs
- **Passive TEMPEST:** Traditional TEMPEST attack, accidental side effects of technology.
- **Active TEMPEST:** Created through the modification of hardware to intentionally create TEMPEST conditions.
- **Amplification:** Consider all TEMPEST attacks amplified.

---

### Can We Amplify Ours?
- **Yes, We Can! How?**
  - **Electronic Components:** Use discreet electronic bits to amplify the signal.
  - **Getting Data Out - Part 2:**
    - Modify the power supply.
    - Attach a microcontroller to the AC line.
    - Connect the microcontroller to the system.
    - Use the 60Hz signal as a carrier and apply complex modulation.
    - Disguise the data as noise.
    - Pass data from the PSU to the CPU via fan speed sensors or by modulating internal power rails.
  - **Getting Data In - Part 2:**
    - Use the same setup.
    - Add a small circuit to demodulate the signal.
    - Connect the microcontroller to the PSU’s fan connector.
    - Report varying RPMs to the motherboard sensor to leak data.

### Hidden Message
- **Attention:** Pay attention! Don't make us bring out the big guns!
- **Hardware Security:** People should take a look at hardware; it's not that scary.
- **Trusted Computing:** Needs a serious look.
- **Prevention:** More effort could help defeat software attacks.
- **Trust:** You can trust us, we’re professionals (just ask DOD).
- **Spotting Feds:** I just spotted a fed! Now can you? :)
