# Domain Account and Exchange Server RCE

## Overview
- **Domain User / Domain Computer**: More than one Exchange Server.
- **From a Domain Account to Exchange Server RCE**:
  - All group members have local administrator privileges on Exchange Servers.
  - **Exchange Trusted Subsystem**:
    - Relaying NTLM over SMB to WinRM:
      - Based on HTTP/HTTPS, supports NTLM authentication.
      - HTTP: Signing and sealing are enabled.
      - HTTPS: Channel Binding is set to Relaxed.

## Available Services
- **Relaying NTLM over SMB to SMB**:
  - SMB signing is enabled by default on Exchange Server.
- **Relaying NTLM over SMB to MSRPC**:
  - NCACN_NP port 445 (SMB).
  - NCACN_IP_TCP port 135 + a dynamic port assigned by EPM.
  - Available services: MS-TSCH, MS-RPRN, MS-SCMR, MS-SAMR, etc.
  - RPC clients can set the auth type to `RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT` to use NTLMSSP.

### Vulnerabilities
- **Relaying NTLM authentication to MSRPC over NCACN_IP_TCP**:
  - **CVE-2020-1113**: Found by @sploutchy from Compass Security.
  - **MS-TSCH on Task Scheduler service**: CVE-2021-1678, found by Eyal Karni and Alex Ionescu from CrowdStrike.
  - **MS-RPRN on Printer Spooler service**: Found by Eyal Karni and Alex Ionescu from CrowdStrike.

## DCOM and NTLM Authentication
- **DCOM** allows COM objects to be used over the network and is based on MSRPC.
- **NTLM authentication to 172.19.0.100:135 (ISystemActivator)**:
  - `ISystemActivator::RemoteCreateInstance(CLSID, IID, â€¦)`
  - **Client**: OBJREF StringBindings NCACN_TCP_IP 172.19.0.100[8652]
  - **Server**: NTLM authentication to 172.19.0.100:8652, Object RPC request, and response.
- **Port 135 and a Dynamic Port**:
  - Signing and sealing are not force-enabled on DCOM servers.
  - DCOM clients can set the auth level to `RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT` to avoid signing and sealing.

## WMI and DCOM
- **WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)**:
  - Based on DCOM, allows administrators to manage remote computers.
- **Exploitable COM Objects**:
  - **MMC20.Application**:
    - `Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand`: Found by @enigma0x3 from SpecterOps.
    - Available on the latest Windows Server 2019 by default.
    - Requires authenticating to only two RPC interfaces.

## Exploit Chain
- **Exchange1** -> **XLAB\attacker** -> **Exchange2**:
  - **Printer Bug**: XLAB\Exchange1$ NTLM authentication.
  - Relay the NTLM authentication to DCOM `ISystemActivator`.
  - Relay the NTLM authentication to DCOM `IDispatch`.
  - Invoke `cmd /c calc`.

## Patches and Mitigation
- **Fixed on Patch Tuesday in June and assigned CVE-2021-26414**.
- Manually set `RequireIntegrityActivationAuthenticationLevel = 1` on DCOM servers.
  - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ole\AppCompat\RequireIntegrityActivationAuthenticationLevel`
  - Force enable `RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY`.

## Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation
- **Previous methods after Exchange RCE**:
  - **WriteDACL on the Domain Object + DCSync**: Fixed in 2019.
  - **Abuse DNS Admins group**: Fixed in 2019.
  - **Abuse the ForceChangePassword right on domain users**:
    - Force change passwords of domain users.
    - Unable to recover the victim user's original password.
  - **Abuse the WriteDACL right on domain users**:
    - Set SPN on domain users and perform the Kerberoasting attack.
    - Sometimes it's hard to brute force passwords if there is a complex password policy.

## Exploit Primitives
- **Group Policy Creator Owners**
- **Exchange Windows Permission**
- **Exchange Trusted Subsystem**
- **Attacker**: XLAB\Exchange1$
  - **RCE**
  - **Member Of**: Add Member, Create OU, Create GPO, Move objects to other containers, Write Distinguished Name, Delete from containers.

### Steps
1. Add users to high-privileged groups.
2. Create new Organizational Units.
3. Create new Group Policy Objects.
4. Move user/computer objects to OUs.
5. Design a new lateral movement method using Evil OU and Evil GPO.
6. Design a new privilege escalation method using EvilComputerOU and EvilComputerGPO.

## GPO Manipulation
- **SharpGPO**: A new red team tool for remotely manipulating GPOs.
  - Get/New/Remove OU, GPO, gPLink, Security Filtering.
- **SharpGPOAbuse (@FSecureLabs)**:
  - Create malicious group policies.
  - User Immediate Task.
  - Computer Immediate Task.

## Mitigation
- Switch to Active Directory split permissions model to effectively limit Exchange rights in Active Directory.

## Conclusion & Takeaways
- **For Red Teams**:
  - Two new Exchange Server vulnerabilities.
  - A new lateral movement/privilege escalation method.
- **For Blue Teams**:
  - Patch all vulnerable Exchange Servers and the Windows Servers where they are running.
  - Switch your Exchange Servers to Active Directory split permissions model if possible.
  - Restrict NTLM usage as much as possible.
