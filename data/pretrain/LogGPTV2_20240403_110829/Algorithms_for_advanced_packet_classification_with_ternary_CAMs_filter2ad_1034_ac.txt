chunks. Each of the chunks takes 2k(cid:0)1 bits to represent, leading to
a total of (2k(cid:0)1):W=k bits. Hence, the number of extra bits needed
is (2k(cid:0)1):W=k(cid:0)W . The worst case expansion is 2W=k(cid:0)1, since
there can be 2 entries corresponding to each of the W=k levels ex-
cept the root level, which can have at most 1 entry. Finally, the addi-
tional logic introduced for modifying the search key can be imple-
mented in a few hundred gates; the logic does not affect throughput
of the search, though it adds a few cycles of latency to the search.
For region-based range encoding scheme, n unique ranges
form at most 2n(cid:0)1 non-overlapping subranges, which are di-
vided equally into r regions. log 2 r bits are needed to represent
a region and (2n(cid:0)1)=r bits are needed to represent the non-
overlapping subranges within that region, leading to a total of
log2 r + (2n(cid:0)1)=r extra bits per entry. Any range can span many
regions fully and at most 2 regions partially. The portion of the

Table 5: Comparison of worst-case expansion of DIRPE and Region-
based range encoding schemes [11, 22] for various extra bits available
for a single ﬁeld.To calculate worst case for region based scheme, we
assume that the database has less than 1024 unique ranges. Note that
using zero extra bits corresponds to using preﬁx expansion.

range in the fully spanned regions can be represented using pre-
(cid:2)x expansion using at most 2 log2 r(cid:0)2 entries, and the 2 partial
regions using 1 entry each, leading to a worst-case expansion of
2 log2 r. We can further reduce the worst-case expansion of this
scheme by applying DIRPE on the representation of the range on
W 0= log2 r bits.
Table 5 compares the worst-case expansion of DIRPE and the
region-based range encoding scheme for a database with 1024
unique ranges in a single (cid:2)eld. For the latter scheme, the worst-case
was calculated by picking the value of r which produced the low-
est expansion while not exceeding the given number of extra bits.
DIRPE outperforms the region-based scheme for the same number
of additional bits used.
3.3.1 Evaluation of DIRPE on Real-life and Random
Databases
Table 6 compares the expansion of DIRPE and region-based
range encoding for a real-life database.2 Despite being database-
independent, DIRPE out-performs the database-dependent region-
based scheme even on real-life databases. For this particular
database, we found that there are 1408 unique ranges in one (cid:2)eld
and 256 unique ranges in another (cid:2)eld. As the number of unique
ranges increases, DIRPE would perform increasingly better. The
fact that DIRPE has better worst-case expansion and update prop-
erties makes it an attractive choice in many systems.
In Figure 3, we plotted the relative size of the database that can
be stored in a given amount of TCAM as a function of the num-
ber of DIRPE bits used, i.e., assuming that one has a TCAM large
enough to store a database, how larger a database can be stored in
the same TCAM as a function of number of DIRPE bits. We ob-
serve that by using 32 total extra bits (recall that rules have two
(cid:2)elds), we are able to accommodate about 50% more rules.
Figure 4 plots the variation of relative capacity improvement for
random database with two range (cid:2)elds. The graph also plots the
improvement in the worst-case bounds for comparison. Not surpris-
ingly, the results for a random database are much better(cid:151)by using
32 bits per entry for DIRPE, the stored database size can be dou-
bled. When considering the worst-case pre(cid:2)x expansion, by using
32 bits for DIRPE, the size of the stored database can be quadru-
pled. To understand exactly how DIRPE improves the expansion, in
Figure 5, we plot the frequency distribution of the number of rules

description provided in [11].

that expand to a given number of TCAM entries for pre(cid:2)x expan-
sion and for DIRPE using 8 bits. Compared to pre(cid:2)x expansion,
DIRPE pushes the distribution to the left uniformly, instead of re-
ducing the expansion of a subset of ranges decided by the database.
An interesting question is how the effectiveness of DIRPE varies
for different widths of the range (cid:2)eld. Note that for (cid:2)elds of larger
width, database-dependent schemes require prohibitively large sup-
port logic in the packet processor when databases have more than a
few tens of unique ranges. Figure 6 shows the effect of number of
