determined for a single victim. The attacker can ﬁx two of the
variables to his liking and solve for the third.
When the attack targets a military GPS receiver, the attacker can-

not change the data content of the messages and is restricted to δA
which is greater than or equal to the transmission delay from the
satellite to the attacker. Hence, the claimed satellite location in the
message is the correct location of the legitimate satellite: LA

4.2 Spooﬁng to One Location
Result 1. One or more receivers Vj ∈ V can be spoofed to any
one location L(cid:48) using a single attacker antenna. Spooﬁng multiple
receivers to the same location L(cid:48) will generally lead to different
time offsets δ(cid:48)
j at each victim.
(12)
The reason for this is that the time-differences of arrival of the
individual satellite signals determine the location that each receiver
will compute.
If the spoofed signals are all sent from the same
attacker antenna, all victims will obtain the same time-differences.
A detailed proof is given in Appendix A, along with a discussion
of the resulting time differences at the victims.
4.3 Spooﬁng to Multiple Locations
We next consider multiple receivers at distinct physical loca-
tions P1, . . . , Pn that the attacker tries to spoof to the locations
L(cid:48)
1, . . . , L(cid:48)
n. Following Result 1, an attacker can spoof any number
of receivers in the transmission range to the same coordinates L(cid:48)
with differing δ(cid:48)
j. If the victims have a way of establishing (coarse)
relative distances, e. g., by estimating their respective distances vi-
sually, or can detect their mutual time offsets, they are able to de-
tect such attacks. Therefore, we will now focus on attacks in which
multiple victims are shifted to a set of new locations that preserve
their mutual distances and mutual time offsets.
As stated in Result 1, if the attacker is using only one transmis-
sion antenna, any possible placement of this antenna will lead to
two victims computing their location to the same coordinates L(cid:48),
with a small time synchronization error. Hence, the attacker can-
not use only one antenna to shift the victims to different locations.
We will now show that, using multiple antennas, the attacker can
spoof two victims to any locations while preserving their mutual
time offsets, with certain restrictions on the time offset in the case
of military GPS receivers.
Result 2. Two receivers at the physical locations P1 (cid:54)= P2 can
1, δ(cid:48)

by P A

the victims
are located at P1 = (1, 0, 0) and P2 = (−1, 0, 0), the physical
distance between the victims is |P1 − P2| = 2. The attacker wants
to spoof the two victims to the locations L(cid:48)
2 =
(0, 2, 0), both with time offset zero: ∆(cid:48)

P2 based on b(cid:48)
Result 3. A necessary condition for a successful GPS group spoof-
ing attack is that ∀Vj, Vk,∀si, b(cid:48)
In other words, the difference b(cid:48)
ijk of the perceived pseudoranges
j and L(cid:48)
of each signal sA
k
must be smaller than or equal to the distance between the victims’
physical locations Pj and Pk. From Equation 11 and the triangle
inequality it follows that bijk ≤ |Pj − Pk|. Since it must hold that
ijk > |Pj−Pk| for any si, then there is no possible
ijk = bijk, if b(cid:48)

As we know from Result 2, for two victims, all possible an-
tenna placements for the attacker lie on a hyperboloid deﬁned by
Pj, L(cid:48)
i . We will now extend this result to the case of
ijk ≤
three and more victims. In the following, we assume that b(cid:48)
|Pj − Pk| is fulﬁlled ∀Vj, Vk and ∀si, i. e., it is physically possible
to spoof the locations of the receivers.

Result 4. In a GPS group spooﬁng attack on three victims V1, V2, V3
to speciﬁc locations L(cid:48)
j, all possible attacker
placements P A
lie on the intersection of two hyperboloids deﬁned
i
by b(cid:48)
This can be shown by constructing two hyperboloids using b(cid:48)
i12
and b(cid:48)
i13 as in Result 2. Both hyperboloids yield the possible place-
ments of attacker’s antennas to achieve the correct pseudorange for
V1, V2 or V1, V3, respectively. Each point on the intersection of the
two hyperboloids has a speciﬁc δA
i and is at the correct distance to
all three victims. Therefore, all points of this space curve are valid

to solve the group spooﬁng problem.
We can extend our example from Result 2 by a third victim
placed at P3 = (1, 5, 0), which is spoofed to L(cid:48)
3 = (1, 1, 0) with
δ(cid:48)
3 = 0. This reduces the possible locations from the hyperboloid as
shown in Figure 5(a) to the intersection curve of the hyperboloids
constructed using b(cid:48)
