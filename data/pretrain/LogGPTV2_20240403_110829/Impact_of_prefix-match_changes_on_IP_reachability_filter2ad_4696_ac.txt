addresses it covered were still reachable (Feb 18,
2009).
dress range continued receiving about the same amount of
traﬃc. Note that the traﬃc volume drops to zero at some
points, meaning that no packets were captured by Netﬂow
during that 5-minute period of time. Because of the correc-
tion for sampling, the corrected bytes at each 5-minute in-
terval tend to be multiples of the smart sampling threshold.
But this example still shows that even if the most-speciﬁc
preﬁx is withdrawn, the less-speciﬁc preﬁx may still be used
to deliver the traﬃc.
Figure 4 shows the traﬃc volume for another address
range, which changes to a less-speciﬁc preﬁx from a diﬀerent
origin AS, corresponding to the third row in Table 3. In this
case, the address range changed from a /20 to /9 preﬁx for
about 15 minutes. As illustrated in the ﬁgure, although a
less-speciﬁc preﬁx is available in the routing table, the traf-
ﬁc volume dropped to zero. If we take the sudden drop of
traﬃc as evidence of the address range becoming unreach-
able, this example illustrates the point that the existence
of a preﬁx in the routing table does not necessarily imply
that the preﬁx is reachable. Of course, it is possible that
the destinations in the address range were still reachable in
this example, but because of low volume, the traﬃc was not
sampled by Netﬂow. As part of our ongoing work, we are
working on techniques for detecting big changes in traﬃc
volume using Netﬂow records, and analyzing the ﬁelds in
these records, such as the number of packets and TCP ﬂags,
to better infer when a collection of IP addresses have become
unreachable.

Figure 4: After the BGP withdrawal, the IP ad-
dresses matched a less-speciﬁc preﬁx; still, no traﬃc
to these destination IP addresses was observed until
after the more-speciﬁc preﬁx was announced again
(Feb 18, 2009).
5. RELATED WORK
Our paper relates to earlier studies that used BGP mea-
surement data to analyze the relationship between IP pre-
ﬁxes [5, 6, 7, 8]. For example, the work on BGP policy
atoms [5, 6] showed that groups of related preﬁxes often have
matching AS paths, even when viewed from multiple van-
tage points; typically, a more-speciﬁc preﬁx had diﬀerent AS
paths than its corresponding less-speciﬁc preﬁx [5]. Other
researchers analyzed BGP table dumps to understand the
reasons why each preﬁx appears in the interdomain routing
system, and the reasons include delegation of address space
to customers, multihoming, and load balancing [7, 8]. Our
results in Table 3 present a similar classiﬁcation scheme,
though focused on the changes in the longest-matching pre-
ﬁx rather than a static analysis of a BGP table dump.
Our work also relates to earlier analysis of BGP routing
dynamics [9, 10, 11, 2]. These studies analyzed announce-
ment and withdrawal message for each destination preﬁx,
and group related BGP update messages to identify BGP
convergence events and route ﬂapping. Whereas these stud-
ies treated each IP preﬁx independently, our analysis of BGP
update dynamics focuses on the relationship between nested
preﬁxes. Still, we draw on the results in these earlier studies
when selecting thresholds for identifying phenomena such as
BGP path exploration and route ﬂapping. Our paper also
relates to measurement studies of preﬁx hijacking and par-
ticularly subpreﬁx hijacking [12, 13] that triggers a change in
the longest-matching preﬁx. However, our study considers
a wider range of causes of preﬁx-match changes.
Previous studies have also characterized IP reachability
through direct or indirect observations of the underlying
data-plane paths used to forward packets [14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20]. Most of these studies involve active probing
(using ping, traceroute, or custom tools) [14, 15, 16, 17],
sometimes triggered by passive observations of reachability
problems [14, 15]. Other work has focused on analysis of pas-
sively collected traﬃc measurements (such as Netﬂow data
or Web server logs) to detect possible routing changes or
reachability problems [18, 19, 20].
In contrast, our paper
has focused primarily on how the longest-matching preﬁx,
used in packet forwarding, changes over time. That said,
these previous studies are quite relevant to our ongoing anal-
ysis of the Netﬂow data to understand the impact of these
preﬁx-match changes on end-to-end reachability.
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we analyze BGP routing changes that af-
fect the longest-matching preﬁx used for packet forwarding.
We ﬁnd that preﬁx-match changes are relatively common,
accounting for more than 13% of BGP update messages.
Ignoring these preﬁx-match changes can lead to mislead-
ing conclusions for researchers and practitioners alike. A
BGP withdrawal does not necessarily imply that IP ad-
dresses have become unreachable, if the route for another
(less-speciﬁc) preﬁx can successfully deliver the traﬃc. A
BGP withdrawal can also make a previously unreachable
destination reachable again, if the withdrawal marks the end
of a subpreﬁx-hijacking event. Or, a withdrawal may have
no impact at all on packet forwarding, if all the IP addresses
match more-speciﬁc preﬁxes. These distinctions can only be
made by understanding the nesting of preﬁxes and tracking
changes in the longest-matching preﬁx over time. Our joint
analysis with the Netﬂow data illustrates the cases where
the relationship between BGP updates and IP reachability
could be counterintuitive.
In our ongoing work, we want to connect our analysis of
preﬁx-match changes with the eﬀects on end-to-end reach-
ability in the data plane. Given the practical limitations
of active probing, we plan to investigate how much informa-
tion we can infer from passive traﬃc measurements, whether
Netﬂow data (as in our preliminary analysis) or ﬁne-grained
packet traces. Our long-term goal is to ﬁnd ways to extract
the maximum amount of useful information from passively-
collected measurement data. We believe the analysis in this
paper is an important ﬁrst step in that direction.
