User: Please introduce how to use Git for code version management.
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system, which is often used for collaborative development, version management, history, feature branches, code backtracking, etc. The following are the steps to use Git for code version management: 1. Install Git First, you need to install Git on your local computer. You can download the latest version from the Git official website and follow the prompts to install it. 2. Create a repository Create a new Git repository on your local computer, which can be initialized with the `git init` command. 3. Add files Add the files that need version management to the Git warehouse, and you can use the `git add` command to add them. 4. Submit files Use the `git commit` command to submit the added files to the warehouse, and you can add comments when submitting. 5. Branch management Use Git for branch management, you can use the `git branch` command to create a new branch, the `git checkout` command to switch to a different branch, and the `git merge` command to merge different branches. 6. Version rollback During the code development process, errors may occur or you need to roll back to a previous version. You can use the `git log` command to view the commit history, and use the `git reset` command to return the code version to Scroll to a specific revision. 7. Interact with the remote warehouse If multiple people need to collaborate on development or backup code, you can interact with the local warehouse and the remote warehouse. You can use the `git remote` command to set the remote warehouse address, and use the `git push` command to push the code from the local warehouse to the remote warehouse, or use the `git pull` command to pull the code from the remote warehouse to the local warehouse update in . The above are the basic steps of using Git for code version management, and the specific operations can be adjusted according to needs and situations.
