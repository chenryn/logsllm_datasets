# Analysis of Communities of Interest in Data Networks

## 1. Introduction
This paper presents a methodology and initial results for characterizing communities of interest (COIs) in data networks. We define COIs as sets of hosts that frequently interact with each other, capturing different types of interactions. Our analysis focuses on the stability and variability of these COIs over time.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Definitions of COIs
- **Popularity COI**: A host is part of the COI if it interacts with a certain percentage of other hosts.
- **Frequency COI**: A host is part of the COI if it interacts with a target host at least once in every time bin over a larger time period.

### 2.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing
We collected network traffic data and preprocessed it to identify the interactions between hosts. The data was then used to compute the COIs for different time periods and bin sizes.

### 2.3 Analysis of Popularity COI
- **Union and Intersection Sets**: We calculated the union and intersection of the COI sets over different time windows (e.g., 3, 6, and 11 weeks).
- **Stability**: The intersection set size indicates that servers present in the COI in the first week have a high probability of remaining in the COI for the entire period, regardless of the threshold. For example, with a 5% threshold, 66 out of the initial 94 servers remained in the intersection set after 11 weeks.
- **Growth of Union Set**: The union set grows slowly, suggesting that the number of new servers added each week is low, making manual verification feasible.

### 2.4 Analysis of Frequency COI
- **Definition**: A host is part of the Frequency COI if it interacts with a target host at least once in every time bin over a larger time period.
- **Evaluation**: We calculated the Frequency COI for each host for each week of our data, using different bin sizes (12, 24, 60, and 120 hours). The Overall Frequency COI is the union of all per-host Frequency COIs for a given bin size.
- **Behavior Over Time**: As the bin size increases, the COI set becomes more inclusive, and the set size increases. The union and intersection set sizes also increase with larger bin sizes. For a fixed bin size, the union set size increases as the time window increases, while the intersection set size decreases.

### 2.5 Overall COI
- **Combining COIs**: We combined the Popularity COI and Frequency COI to form the Overall COI.
- **Out-of-Profile Interactions**: We defined interactions with hosts outside the Overall COI as out-of-profile interactions. We calculated the distribution of these interactions for different threshold and bin-size pairs.
- **Results**: For a 6-week period, 50% of local hosts had less than 6 out-of-profile interactions, and 90% had no more than 20. For an 11-week period, the corresponding numbers were 10 and 31, respectively.
- **Impact of Popularity COI**: As the Popularity COI becomes more inclusive (threshold closer to zero), it contributes more significantly to the Overall COI. This suggests that the Popularity COI captures important infrequent interactions.

## 3. Conclusions
- **Host Behavior**: Hosts typically act as both clients and servers, requiring explicit management.
- **Stability of COIs**: Broad COI definitions show similar distributions over daily and monthly timescales, indicating stability.
- **Core COIs**: Core COIs, representing core host interactions, show significant stability over several weeks.
- **Future Work**: We are moving from aggregate COI characterization to finer-grained per-host characterization to provide models that accurately capture host behavior.
