of a ﬁeld is empty, we ﬁll it with a dummy value (“none”).
We also need to take extra care of pseudonymized values
which might be GDPR-compliant. In contrast to anonymized
strings (e.g., “redacted for privacy”), pseudonymized values
are uniquely generated for different data subjects. For in-
stance, a provider could use [hash_1]@example.com
and [hash_2]@example.com (where [hash_1] and
[hash_2] are different hash strings) to mask two email ad-
dresses. However, WHOIS strings with pseudonymized values
are hardly clustered together, which increases the outlier ratio
and affects the accuracy. To eliminate its impact, based on
manual analysis on DG, we apply the following rules to handle
pseudonymized values.
the domain name itself
contains
(e.g., “owner of
example.com”), we replace the domain name with a
ﬁxed string “domain”.
● Domain name in redacted values. If a redacted value
● Number in registrant name. If the registrant name con-
● Email address. As summarized in Table I,
tains a digital number (e.g., “customer no. 123456”), we
replace the number with a ﬁxed string “number”.
the email
address ﬁeld can be replaced by a pseudonymized email
address or a hyperlink to a web form. Given that the
pseudonymized values under a WHOIS provider tend to
be generated automatically (e.g., using hash values of the
same length), we use a quadruple template to represent
this ﬁeld, including 1) the length of the local-part of the
email address; 2) the domain of the email address; 3) the
domain of the link to the web form; 4) the number of
phrases in this ﬁeld, separated by white space (some reg-
istrars ﬁll multiple phrases in this ﬁeld). In Figure 3’s ex-
ample (1a79a4d60de6718e8e5b326e338ae533@
example.com), the length of the local-part is 32, and
the domain name of the email address is example.com.
The value is not a web link, thus the third part is ﬁlled
with “none”. Finally, the number of phrases is 1.
The set of WHOIS strings with the same main key can
be considered as a text corpus, and we use TF-IDF [94] to
compute their term frequencies as features. TF-IDF is widely
used to generate statistical features for document clustering
and we use it for a similar purpose. We use white spaces, tab
characters and punctuation as separators to split terms.
Step III: Clustering WHOIS strings. The WHOIS strings
generated in Step II comprise all ﬁelds that should be pro-
tected, thus we choose to cluster them as a whole for efﬁciency.
We cluster WHOIS strings based on the TF-IDF features and
compute the outlier ratio to infer the degree of GDPR com-
pliance for a WHOIS provider. We leverage DBSCAN [46], a
density-based clustering algorithm which can detect outliers,
for the task. DBSCAN treats clusters as high-density areas
separated by low-density areas. It does not require the number
of clusters to be speciﬁed ahead, which can ﬁnd arbitrarily-
shaped clusters and scale to large datasets. For WHOIS strings
under the same main key, we use DBSCAN to mark the outliers
and calculate their ratio over the number of total records.
The only parameter of DBSCAN is min_samples which
speciﬁes the minimum size of a cluster, and we empirically
set it to 25.
For GDPR-compliant providers, we expect that protected
WHOIS records are similar and thus clustered together. How-
ever, domains with the same contact information (e.g., regis-
tered in bulk by the same registrant) can also form clusters,
which lowers the outlier ratio. Such clusters are different
from “GDPR-compliant clusters” in that personal information
is included. Therefore, we leverage the NER (Named-entity
Recognition) annotator of the Stanford CoreNLP Natural Lan-
guage Processing Toolkit [71] to ﬁnd clusters containing infor-
mation of natural persons. The toolkit is based on trained CRF
(Conditional Random Field) sequence taggers and a system for
processing temporal expressions, and can recognize a given
named entity as PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION
and MISC. In our setting, if one sample of WHOIS strings
within a cluster contains names labeled as “PERSON”, we
label all records in the cluster as outliers. Though the time
consumed by applying CoreNLP on a record is non-negligible,
the overall overhead is small thanks to the clustering process
executed beforehand.
To enable large-scale analysis, we implement the clustering
module with MapReduce [41] and scikit-learn [82], and run
the program on a Hadoop cluster. The WHOIS strings are
preprocessed by mappers, allocated to reducers according to
their main keys, and clustered by all reducers in parallel. Due
to the memory limit (2GB) of each reducer machine, we only
keep a random sample of 20,000 records under each main key.
On average, the clustering task of each main key ﬁnishes in 3
minutes, and it takes 25 minutes to analyze one-week data of
all WHOIS providers.
Step IV: Classifying WHOIS providers. With the outlier
score computed for each main key value (different provider,
region, data subject and week), we classify a WHOIS provider
by the level of GDPR compliance. The outlier scores under
each provider will be compared against a set of thresholds and
we leverage the ground-truth dataset (i.e., DG) to determine

their values. From our prior observations in Figure 4, we assign
three compliance levels to the WHOIS providers:
● Fully-compliant. Over
● Partially-compliant. 50%-95% WHOIS records

are
redacted. 4 providers fall into this category.
Next, we generate the weekly outlier scores of the 50
providers on the entire 104 week’s data (from Jan 2018 to Dec
2019). Table III shows a sample of providers and weeks. The
degree of changes differs signiﬁcantly by the three categories
before and after the GDPR enforcement deadline, indicating
the effectiveness of clustering on the larger dataset. However,
using one outlier score to classify a provider is not enough,
due to the sampling done by our industrial provider and
GCChecker. We experiment with different statistical metrics
on the sequence of outlier ratios and ﬁnd two that are most
distinguishing: 1) the number of weeks (N W ) in 2019 when
the outlier ratio is below 0.05, and 2) the drop (D) of the
average outlier ratios before May 2018 and after May 2018.
In Figure 6, we plot N W and D of the 50 providers and ﬁnd
the ranges are largely different by the three categories. In the
end, we set two conditions to classify a provider by comparing
N W and D to thresholds:
● Condition 1: If N W is over 40, the WHOIS provider is
● Condition 2: When Condition 1 is not satisﬁed, if D is
categorized as “fully-compliant”.
over 0.2, the WHOIS provider is categorized as “partially-
compliant”, otherwise categorized as “not compliant”.
6According to the ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation, domain holders may
consent WHOIS providers to release their real contact information. From the
behavior of 84% providers in DG, we consider 5% unprotected records as a
conservative upper bound of “fully-compliant”.

C. System Evaluation
In this section we ﬁrst evaluate the key components of
GCChecker separately, then its end-to-end effectiveness.
Data preprocessing rules. In Step II, three data preprocessing
rules are generated from DG to handle pseudonymized ﬁeld
values, and here we assess their generality across other WHOIS
providers. To this end, we use the entire dataset collected in
Dec 2019 and randomly sample 20 EEA records under each
provider for manual inspection, resulting in 10,200 WHOIS
records from 510 providers (including the 50 providers in DG).
We ﬁnd no additional pseudonymized values that should be
preprocessed.
Clustering and NER annotator. In Step III, DBSCAN and
CoreNLP are used to mark unprotected WHOIS records as
outliers. To evaluate the performance of this module, we
run the program on DG where 5,647 records have been
manually labeled as unprotected. The system reports 4,691
outlying records, in which 4,620 are also manually labeled
as unprotected, so precision is 98.4% (4,620/4,691) and recall
is 81.8% (4,620/5,647). The false positives are resulted from
unpopular choices of redacted values, while false negatives are
large domain holders not correctly recognized by CoreNLP.
While the high precision ensures most GDPR-compliant
records can be identiﬁed, the recall is less satisfactory. A
potential effect of false negatives is that providers may receive
lower outlier ratios than the actual ratio of unprotected records,
and we assess the distribution of errors on results of DG.
For the 42 fully-compliant providers, we ﬁnd they only have
clusters of protected WHOIS records (which should not be
outliers), so they are not affected by false negatives. By
contrast, 6 in 8 partially- and non-compliant providers have
clusters of large domain holders that are not identiﬁed as
outliers, and their outlier ratio can be lowered by 0.07 to
0.38 (0.17 on average). However, considering the compliance
degrees we set, 49 of 50 providers (including 5 providers which
receive a lowered outlier ratio) still get an outlier ratio in
the range of their corresponding categories. Only one non-
compliant provider receives an outlier ratio of 0.49 (lowered
by 0.38 because of false negatives), which falls into the range
of partially-compliant. This provider can be correctly classiﬁed
as not compliant, if we compare its sequence of weekly outlier
ratio against the conditions in Step IV, as in other weeks the
provider is given outlier ratios in the correct range. Therefore,
the impact of false negatives on the ﬁnal result is expected to
be insigniﬁcant.
End-to-end effectiveness. To evaluate the end-to-end effec-
tiveness of GCChecker (i.e., whether the output WHOIS
provider category is correct), we compile a test set (termed
as DT ) of 20 WHOIS providers, including 10 registrars and
10 registries. The 20 providers are randomly selected beyond
the 50 providers in DG (but they should also have enough EEA
records for analysis)7. Similarly, for each provider we sample
1,000 EEA records collected in Dec 2019, manually label each
record, and give its level of GDPR compliance based on the
ratio of unprotected records. We label 17 providers as fully-
compliant (e.g., ID-1239), 1 as partially-compliant (ID-1725)
7Because in DG we select the top 50 providers, the 20 providers in DT
are smaller in domain share.
and 2 as not compliant (e.g., ID-52). Further, the clustering
results on DT show that only the one partially-compliant
provider receives a lowered outlier ratio by 0.08 because of
false negatives, but the output ratio (0.24) is still in the correct
range (i.e., 0.05 to 0.50 for partially-compliant providers).
We then run GCChecker on the 2-year dataset to generate
the weekly outlier ratio for each provider and compare them
against our conditions. All 20 providers are correctly classiﬁed
by GCChecker, suggesting that the system performs well
end-to-end.
Choice of system parameters. There are several parameters
in the design of GCChecker and here we discuss our choices
on them. In Step II, DBSCAN takes min_samples as the
minimum size of a cluster. A high value results in more
outliers, which potentially removes more unpopular choices
of redacted values from clusters. Also, fewer providers can
be analyzed because more EEA records are required for each
week. By contrast, a low value results in more clusters,
including those of large domain holders, which affects the
accuracy. We set this value to 25 and our evaluation shows that
the system generally works well end-to-end, while ensuring
that 143 providers can be analyzed in a weekly basis (in
Section IV).
In Step IV, the conditions classifying WHOIS providers
are established based on thresholds (i.e., N W and D). The
thresholds are selected from clustering results of providers in
DG on the 104-week dataset (see Figure 6). Combined with
the provider categories we set, a WHOIS provider is classiﬁed
as fully-compliant only if the outlier ratio is stable enough at
a low level (i.e., remain lower than 0.05 for a long period,
through N W ).
Limitations. 1) We are unable to directly run GCChecker
on WHOIS providers with a small number of EEA records in
the weekly time window (e.g., ID-420 Alibaba Cloud based
in China). For long-tail providers, we loosen the time window
to 2 months to aggregate more EEA domains for clustering,
and provide a separate analysis in Section V. By this change,
we are able to signiﬁcantly increase the number of providers
to be assessed. Though ﬁner-grained dynamics are missing
for this analysis (e.g., how providers act right before and
after the GDPR enforcement deadline), the general degree of
compliance can be learned. 2) The recall of outlier detection
(81.8%) could be improved. Identifying whether a WHOIS
record is protected is challenging, due to a lack of context in
the WHOIS records. We use the NER-based method which is
considered as the best-effort approach by the NLP community.
Combined with DBSCAN, we ﬁnd that the system generally
works well end-to-end based on evaluations. 3) The GDPR and
ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation give EEA registrants rights
to allow WHOIS providers to publish their real contacts. We
cannot identify whether the unprotected records are consented
solely from data analysis. As we choose 5% unprotected
records as a conservative upper bound for “fully-compliant”,
providers with a large number of EEA users allowing to
publish their real data could be classiﬁed as otherwise. For
providers not classiﬁed as fully-compliant by GCChecker,
we have been reporting the results to them and list some of
the feedback in Section IV. We also release an online tool for
WHOIS providers to check their compliance status (discussed
in Section VII).
D. Ethical Considerations
The major ethical considerations of this study are the col-
lection of WHOIS records and the analysis of (non-redacted)
personal data inside the WHOIS dataset. To avoid overloading
the WHOIS servers, our industrial partner enforces strict rate
limit when sending WHOIS queries. We are informed by our
industrial partner that they have not received warnings from
any WHOIS provider so far. The same data collection method
has also been used by previous works [70], [62], [61], [63]
