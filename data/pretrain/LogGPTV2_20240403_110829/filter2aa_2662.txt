HACKERS VS. DISASTERS
Our hacker brains are pre-wired to find alternate 
uses for many devices. We look at the world as a 
puzzle to solve in everything we do. We can 
come up with the most extraordinary solutions 
to problems under the most extraordinary 
circumstances.
Hacker skills are largely compatible with the 
skills necessary to survive in the wilderness or 
during a natural disaster.
HACKER SKILLS FOR WILDERNESS 
AND DISASTER SURVIVAL
PART 1
Have you seen Survivorman?

Michael “theprez98” Schearer
• Previous speaker at DEFCON, ShmooCon, 
HOPE and other conferences
• Contributor to several Syngress books
Why you should listen to me (maybe)
• Military experience
• Graduate of the Department of 
Defense’s Survival, Evasion, 
Resistance and Escape (SERE) 
school
• Other survival and outdoor 
training
• Skills learned from experiences 
(both good and bad!)
Why you should be skeptical
I am not this guy…
…or this guy
• I am not a survival expert; other people (maybe 
some of you) know more than I do
• Survival skills will vary based upon experience, 
training, geography, weather, time of year and 
other factors
Why you should care:
Natural disasters
• Tornadoes
– ~1300 tornadoes per year since 2000
– $427 million of damage per year since 1950
• Hurricanes
– ~10 named (Atlantic) storms per year since 1944
– $1.6-6.2 billion of damage per year since 1950
– Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused an estimated 
$45 billion dollars in damage
Why you should care:
Natural disasters/Pandemics
• Earthquakes
– 19.4 magnitude 7.0+ earthquakes per year
– $4.4 billion in damage per year
• H1N1 Flu Pandemic (as of July 24/29)*
– 43,771 cases, 302 deaths (U.S.) 
– 134,503 cases, 816 deaths (worldwide)
In 2008, there were 9 weather events whose damage 
costs exceeded $1 billion and caused 256 deaths
Why you should care:
Influenza waves
Why you should care:
Large scale/long term power outages
• On August 14, 2003, cascading shutdowns at over 100 power 
plants resulted in 61,800 megawatts of power being lost to 50 
million people
• In January 2009, 68 counties and 36 cities in Kentucky, totaling 
525,00 people, lost power in a powerful winter storm; many 
people lost power for several weeks
Why you should care:
The bottom line
• People underestimate how physically 
demanding the outdoors can be
• Thousands of people get lost every year on 
simple day trips with no maps, inadequate 
supply of food and water, lack of warm clothes
• Many people are unprepared to live without 
power for anything longer than a few hours
• The time when something bad happens is too 
late to start thinking about being prepared
What I did*
• Traveled to “remote” areas for primitive 
overnight camping
• One day’s supply of food and water
• No shelter
• Video camera, limited other supplies
I attempted “real life” demonstrations as a 
means of showing how the Hands-On 
Imperative can apply to survival situations
Appalachian mountains

National Seashore

OMG! PONIES!
Five Basic Survival Skills
• Fire
• Shelter
• Signaling
• Food and Water
• First Aid
Q. Which is most important?
A. It depends.
FIRE
“What disaster makes it so that guns and matches don't 
work? If you want to survive, buy a case of ammo and 
some waterproof matches.”
--Penn Jillette, “End of the World,” Bullshit!
Fire
• Fire provides warmth, light, and comfort
• Allows for cooking and boiling
• Matches and lighters: Ok, but…
• Bow drill fire on the fly? Think again…
• Fire sticks, dryer lint, steel wool and batteries
• FireSteel
The bottom line: have multiple fire-starting 
methods available at all times
Fire
SHELTER
“Clothing is shelter in close proximity to the body.”
--Donald C. Cooper, National 
Association for Search and Rescue
Shelter
• Provides some degree of protection from the 
elements as well as psychological comfort
• The shelter you choose to build will be highly 
dependent upon location, time of year, 
weather and other circumstances
• Clothing is shelter in close proximity to the 
body; wear layers to be able to shed and add
Shelter
• Select your site considering availability of 
water (and avoiding water), protection from 
the elements, and proximity to resources
• If you need to break or destroy something to 
help you stay alive, do it!
The things you use to make a shelter are often 
the “perfect camouflage” from those searching 
for you
Shelter
SIGNALING
“The irony of survival is that for all the planning and 
preparation you do to stay alive in the wild, all you 
really want to do is to go home.”
--Les Stroud, Survive!
Signaling
• Once your immediate safety is taken care of, 
prepare your signals to be ready at any time
• Mirrors/Flashlights/Flares/Chemicals
• Signal fire, triangle, day/night
• Personal Locator Beacon (PLBs)
• SPOT satellite messenger
• SendAnSOS.com
Signaling
FOOD AND WATER
“It is wise to bring some water, when one goes out to 
look for water.”
--Arab proverb
Food and water
• You can live 4-6 weeks without food
• You can only live 2-10 days without water
• Very hot, very cold, very dry, and windy 
environments are all bad for water needs
• Waterborne illnesses (giardia)
• Boiling water
• Eating ice/snow?
• Drinking your own urine?!
Food and water
• “The Myth of Wild Edibles”: identification, 
availability, season, latitude
• Insects/bugs/other various critters
• Fish and small game: traps, snares, falls
• Water needs increase with more food
Food and water
FIRST AID
Lou: A bandage keeps a boo-boo
Louise: or an "owie" clean and safe.
Lou: We're the Safety Patrol.
Louise: We're here to keep people safe.
Dad: Kids, aren't you forgetting something?
Lou: We are?
Louise: I thought we covered everything.
Dad: You forgot to kiss it and make it better.
Louise: Oops.
Lou: Oh, right.
-- Lou and Lou: Safety Patrol
First aid
• Do not panic
• STOP: Stop, Think, Observe, Plan
• First Aid & CPR
• Eyes, Feet, Hands, Stomach (Stroud Survival 
Tip)
PREPARATION
“Luck is what happens when preparation meets 
opportunity.”
--Seneca
Given the will to survive, 
thriving in the wild or in a 
disaster situation or in the 
wilderness is largely a matter 
of preparation combined with 
the “hacker” ingenuity to find 
creative solutions under 
extraordinary circumstances.

sunscreen
• Extra food and water
• Extra clothes
• Headlamp/flashlight

experts recommend supplementing the essentials
Bug Out Bag

evacuation (~72 hours)
– One gallon of water per day per person

– Etc…
• Contents dependent upon location and 
individuals (kids, elderly, pets, medicine…)
FINAL THOUGHTS
“Man can live about forty days without food, about 
three days without water, about eight minutes 
without air, but only for one second without hope.”
--Author unknown
Final Thoughts
• Don’t be squeamish about breaking or 
destroying something to help you stay alive
• You are not Jack Bauer, MacGyver, or 
Survivorman; you need practice to survive
• Employ the Hands-On Imperative: “Don’t 
consider what it is, but what it could be”
Your psychological strength together with the 
will to survive is the most important survival skill
