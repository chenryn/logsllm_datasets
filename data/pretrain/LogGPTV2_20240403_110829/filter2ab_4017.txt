ATT&CK Technique Name:User Account Management
Ensure that user accounts with administrative rights follow best practices, including use of privileged access workstations, Just in Time/Just Enough Administration (JIT/JEA), and strong authentication. Reduce the number of users that are members of highly privileged Directory Roles.[5] In AWS environments, prohibit users from calling the sts:GetFederationToken API unless explicitly required.[7]
