**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Account Management

To enhance security and adhere to best practices, it is essential to manage user accounts with administrative rights carefully. This includes:

- Utilizing **privileged access workstations** to ensure that administrative tasks are performed in a secure environment.
- Implementing **Just in Time (JIT) and Just Enough Administration (JEA)** to grant elevated privileges only when necessary and for the minimum required duration.
- Enforcing **strong authentication methods** to verify the identity of users before granting access.

Additionally, reduce the number of users who are members of highly privileged directory roles to minimize the potential attack surface.

In AWS environments, restrict users from calling the `sts:GetFederationToken` API unless it is explicitly required. This helps prevent unauthorized access and enhances overall security.
