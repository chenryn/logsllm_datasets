User: I want to create a bytecode-only distribution from distutils (no really, I do; I know what I'm doing). Using setuptools and the bdist_egg command, you can simply provide the --exclude-source parameter. Unfortunately the standard commands don't have such an option.

Is there an easy way to strip the source files just before the tar.gz, zip, rpm or deb is created.
Is there a relatively clean per-command way to do this (eg just for tar.gz or zip).
Assistant: "the standard commands don't have such an option"?
Do you have the latest version of setuptools installed? And did you write a setup.py file?
If so, this should work: python setup.py bdist_egg --exclude-source-files.
