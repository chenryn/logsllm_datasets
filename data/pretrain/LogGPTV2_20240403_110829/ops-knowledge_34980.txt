User: Please explain what is a reverse proxy server and what is its main purpose?
Assistant: reverse proxy server is an intermediary that forwards client requests to one or more hidden backend servers. These backend servers may be located in different locations (different data centers, different cities, or different countries) and may provide different applications or services. Its main purpose is to: 1. Load balancing: The reverse proxy server can evenly distribute client requests to multiple back-end servers to reduce the load pressure on the back-end servers and improve performance and stability. 2. Cache static content: the reverse proxy server can cache static content (such as pictures, videos, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to reduce the load pressure on the back-end server and speed up the response time of the client. 3. Safe access: The reverse proxy server can hide the real IP address and port number of the back-end server, making it difficult for attackers to directly access and attack the back-end server, and can protect the back-end server from malicious attacks through some security mechanisms. 4. Unified entrance: The reverse proxy server can be used as a unified entrance to integrate the services of multiple back-end servers to facilitate client access and management.
