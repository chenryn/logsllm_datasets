### Issue with `sudo` Command on CentOS 5.3 VPS Server

**Environment:**
- **Operating System:** CentOS 5.3
- **Hosting Provider:** Linode
- **VPS Setup:** Fresh installation of CentOS 5.3, followed by a `yum update` to apply recent patches.

**Problem Description:**
After installing the `sudo` package (which was not included by default), I edited the `sudoers` file and configured it successfully. When I log in via SSH as a regular user and use `sudo` to execute commands that require root privileges, I receive the following error message:

```
audit_log_user_command(): Connection refused
```

Despite this error, the `sudo` command is executed. However, there is no record of the command in the system logs, as evidenced by the following command:

```bash
grep sudo /var/log/messages
```

This command returns only one line referencing the `yum install`.

### Analysis and Solution

**Cause:**
The error message `audit_log_user_command(): Connection refused` occurs because the `auditd` service, which is responsible for logging audit events, is not enabled or compiled into the kernel by default in CentOS 5.3. This is a cosmetic issue and does not affect the functionality of the `sudo` command.

**Solution:**

1. **Compile a New Kernel with `auditd` Support:**
   - You can compile a new kernel (version > 2.6.23) and enable `auditd` support by setting the `CONFIG_AUDIT=y` option during the kernel configuration.
   - This will allow the `auditd` service to log `sudo` commands correctly.

2. **Update `sudo` Package:**
   - Alternatively, you can try updating to a newer version of the `sudo` package. This might resolve the issue, although the specific outcome may vary depending on your environment.

**Steps to Compile a New Kernel:**

1. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
   sudo yum install kernel-devel
   ```

2. **Download and Extract the Kernel Source:**
   ```bash
   wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.4.0.tar.gz
   tar -xzf linux-5.4.0.tar.gz
   cd linux-5.4.0
   ```

3. **Configure the Kernel:**
   ```bash
   make menuconfig
   ```
   - Navigate to `Security options` and enable `Audit support` by setting `CONFIG_AUDIT=y`.

4. **Compile and Install the Kernel:**
   ```bash
   make
   sudo make modules_install
   sudo make install
   ```

5. **Reboot the System:**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

After following these steps, the `auditd` service should be able to log `sudo` commands, and the error message should no longer appear.

**Note:**
- Compiling a new kernel is an advanced task and should be performed with caution.
- Ensure you have a backup of your current system before making any changes.

If you prefer not to compile a new kernel, you can continue to use `sudo` as is, and the error message can be safely ignored.
