I was just messing around with some toy problems and discovered that you could
create multiple methods with the same signature when using concrete types in
parametric methods:
    julia> foo(a::Int64, b::Int64) = a + b
    foo (generic function with 1 method)
    julia> foo{T foo{A methods(foo)
    #3 methods for generic function "foo":
    foo{T<:Int64}(a::T, b::T) at none:1
    foo{A<:Int64,B<:Int64}(a::A, b::B) at none:1
    foo(a::Int64, b::Int64) at none:1
If a parametric type variable uses a concrete type shouldn't that type replace
the type variable in the signature?
