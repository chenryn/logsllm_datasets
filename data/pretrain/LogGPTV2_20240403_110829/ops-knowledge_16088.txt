Emergency response plan - establish an emergency response plan and specify the emergency response process for system administrators; - implement regular drills to improve the efficiency and level of emergency response. 10. Remote access management - limit the connection time, times and concurrent connections of remote access; - set remote access parameters, prohibit root user login and access, etc. Related tools: 1.
