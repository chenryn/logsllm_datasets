User: Please use the Ansible automation tool to write a deployment script that can be used on multiple machines
Assistant: The following is a sample Ansible deployment script that can be used for deployment on multiple machines: 1. Suppose we have 3 target machines to deploy: ``` [web] 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3 ``` 2. Create a file named `deploy.yml` which is the main configuration file for Ansible playbook. ``` --- - name: Deploy App to Web Nodes hosts: web become: yes tasks: - name: Install Required Dependencies apt: update_cache: yes name: - python3 - python3-pip state: present - name: Clone App Repository git: repo: https://github.com/yourusername/yourapp.git dest: /tmp/yourapp register: git_clone_result - name: Install App Dependencies pip: requirements: /tmp/yourapp/requirements.txt - name: Run App command : /tmp/yourapp/start.sh ``` 3. Run the following command to execute the deployment script: ``` $ ansible-playbook deploy.yml ``` This will log in to each target machine using ssh, execute each tasks to install dependencies, clone the code repository, install application dependencies and run the application. This example is just a basic script, you can modify it according to your actual needs. For example, if your application needs a .env file to configure environment variables, you can add some tasks to copy the .env file to the target machine.
