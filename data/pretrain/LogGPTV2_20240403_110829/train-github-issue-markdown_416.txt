So far I really like Atom 1.0 - it's got a long way to go, but it will get
there. We needed an editor like this.
Anyway: the only thing bothering me was how quickly it installed itself
(Windows 8.1, 64 bit). Even though that might sound like a _good_Â¨thing, it
isn't. When I double-click the installer I get no options, no information
whatsoever. Only a screen "Atom is installing and will launch when ready." For
some people this might be the best approach, but for a whole lot of others it
isn't.
Some options would be great. I am thinking: file association, installation
directory, packages to include with installation (I for one don't need all
packages that are included on default install) and so on. I could understand
that file association and package control aren't included (though I'd really
like that) but why not the ability to choose your own installation directory?
