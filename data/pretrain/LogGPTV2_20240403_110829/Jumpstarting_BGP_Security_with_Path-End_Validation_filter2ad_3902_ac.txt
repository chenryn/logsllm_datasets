### Success Rate of Randomly Selected Attackers

Our results demonstrate that path-end validation significantly enhances security, reducing the attacker's success rate with their optimal strategy (a 2-hop attack) to 5.8% when only 20 adopters are present. This improvement surpasses both RPKI (8.3%) and partial deployment of BGPsec (8.2% when all top 100 ISPs adopt). In fact, path-end validation nearly achieves the best possible outcome before BGP is deprecated, i.e., a 5.3% attacker success rate when BGPsec is fully deployed (but the attacker can still advertise legacy BGP routes).

### Results for Specific Classes of Attackers and Victims

The above results are based on scenarios involving random attackers and/or victims. Given that over 85% of ASes on the Internet are stubs (ASes with no customer ASes), this skews the results towards stub attackers and victims. To understand how an attacker's or victim's size and position within the ISP hierarchy affect the results, we conducted simulations for different classes of attackers and victims. We considered four categories:
1. Large ISPs (with 250+ customers)
2. Medium ISPs (with 250 > customers ≥ 25)
3. Small ISPs (with 25 > customers ≥ 1)
4. Stubs (with no customers)

We generated results, similar to those in Figure 2a, for all 16 combinations of these categories.

### Detailed Analysis of Attacker-Victim Scenarios

Our analysis of all 16 attacker-victim scenarios reveals that with relatively few adopters (ranging from less than 10 to 100, depending on the categories of the attacker and victim), path-end validation makes the next-AS attack less effective than the 2-hop attack. Due to space constraints, we present results for the two extremes: the most central ASes (transit-wise), i.e., large ISPs, and the least central ASes, i.e., stubs. Figures 3a and 3b show the results for scenarios where the attacker is a large ISP and the victim is a stub, and vice versa. As expected, large ISPs are powerful attackers, as indicated by their high success rates, while stubs are weak attackers. However, path-end validation has the same qualitative effect in both scenarios: even with a small number of adopters, the attacker is better off bypassing path-end validation and announcing a longer (2-hop) path.

### Effectiveness of k-Hop Attacks

Figure 4 illustrates the success rate of an attacker launching a "k-hop" path-manipulation attack when no defense is deployed. The x-axis represents the number of hops (k), and the y-axis shows the average success rate of a randomly selected attacker launching a k-hop attack on a randomly selected victim. For reference, we also include the success rate of the attacker when BGPsec is fully deployed but legacy BGP advertisements are allowed [33] (line 2).

This figure captures the key idea behind path-end validation. When k = 0, the attacker is simply performing a prefix hijack (i.e., announcing itself as the destination of the prefix). This is much more effective than a 1-hop attack (the next-AS attack). Indeed, this type of attack (and subprefix hijacking) is precisely what RPKI is designed to prevent. Additionally, while the 1-hop attack is more beneficial to the attacker than the 2-hop attack, the 2-hop attack does not significantly outperform the 3-hop attack. We conclude that path-end validation provides the best security against path-manipulation attacks, balancing deployability and efficiency.

### Geography-Based Deployment

A potential strategy for boosting initial deployment of path validation mechanisms is for governments to incentivize large ISPs in their countries to adopt them. We investigate whether such local adoption can protect local communication, i.e., ASes in that geographical region, and compare path-end validation and BGPsec as potential mechanisms. This is important because many end-users access content from servers in their geographic region due to the popularity of content delivery networks and communicate with local services (banking, healthcare, etc.), and to ensure the availability of critical national infrastructures.

Using the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) division of the world into five geographic regions, we considered adoption only by ISPs in a particular region. We then measured how many benign ASes in the region are fooled into taking a malicious route to a victim in the region advertised by attackers (both internal and external to the region).

Figure 5 shows the fraction of North-American ASes that an attacker can attract when trying to capture traffic to a North-American AS. With only 10 adopters, path-end validation protects communication between two ASes in North America, even if the attacker is co-located in North America (Figure 5a), reducing the attacker’s success rate to just above 13% with their best strategy (2-hop attack). Similar results for Europe, presented in Figure 6, show that the top 20 European ISPs need to adopt the protocol to achieve a similar effect. We also find that RPKI provides a relatively high level of security for European ASes against external attackers (see Figure 6b). However, Europe still benefits from the deployment of path-end validation, which gradually decreases the attacker’s success rate until, with the top 100 ISPs adopting the defense, the attacker’s best strategy becomes the 2-hop attack, yielding a 11.2% success rate. These results provide significant motivation for adoption, considering recent attacks on ASes from Iceland and Belarus [2], and the emphasis on routing security by the European Union. We contrast these results with BGPsec under the same partial deployment, which provides only marginal benefits over RPKI, as shown in line 2 of both figures.

### Revisiting High-Profile Past Incidents

Our results in Section 4.2 quantify the average success rate of random attackers and victims. What about specific attacker-victim cases? We revisit four recent high-profile prefix-hijack incidents to illustrate the immediate security benefits of deploying path-end validation with RPKI:
1. Syria-Telecom hijacks YouTube [9] on December 9th, 2014
2. Indosat hijacks over 400,000 prefixes on April 3rd, 2014 [1]
3. Turk-Telecom hijacks DNS resolvers in Google, OpenDNS, and Level3 on March 29, 2014 [5]
4. Opin Kerfi’s (an ISP in Iceland) repeated prefix-hijacks [2] in December 2013

Some of these incidents are attributed to benign configuration errors, while others are suspected attacks. Since this section considers the scenario where RPKI is fully deployed, such prefix-hijacks can be detected and mitigated. We thus consider the next-AS attack, which is not prevented by RPKI, with respect to the same attacker-victim pairs.

No simulation framework can capture all intricacies of interdomain routing (e.g., ASes’ actual routing policies). Our aim is to get a high-level idea of path-end validation’s potential influence in these concrete scenarios. We computed, for every attacker-victim pair, the next-AS attacker’s success rate with X adopters from the largest ISPs, where X = 0, 5, ..., 100. Figure 7 describes the attacker’s success rate for path-end validation and for BGPsec in partial deployment. Even with a modest number of path-end validation adopters, the attacker’s best strategy is to launch the 2-hop attack and avoid detection by the path-end validation mechanism (see Figure 7a). In contrast, BGPsec exhibits far inferior security benefits (see Figure 7b).

Figure 7c plots the attacker’s success rate in each deployment scenario (X = 0, 5, ..., 100 adopters) for their best attack strategy among the two (next-AS and 2-hop) against the path-end validation defense. For example, in the Turk-Telecom case, before any AS adopts path-end validation, the attacker’s best strategy is the next-AS attack, resulting in a success rate of almost 25%, attracting nearly a quarter of the Internet. As more large ISPs adopt the path-end validation defense, the success of the next-AS attack is significantly decreased. Indeed, even with 15 adopters, the attacker is better off switching to the 2-hop attack to bypass the path-end validation mechanism, and the attacker’s success rate remains fixed at about 5%.

### Robustness Tests

Our evaluation so far has considered deployment by a small set of the very top ISPs. We now evaluate the security benefits where path-end validation or BGPsec are adopted by some of the top ISPs. The results in Figure 8 compare path-end validation to BGPsec under probabilistic deployment scenarios. The x-axis describes 11 deployment scenarios, where for each value x, the corresponding deployment scenario is as follows: We consider, for a specified probability p (p = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75), the set of x_p top ISPs. We then select each of these ISPs as an adopter with probability p. Hence, in deployment scenario x, the expected number of adopters is x. The measurement for each deployment scenario is repeated 20 times, and Figure 8 plots the averaged results.

We observe that as path-end validation benefits from the adoption of the top ISPs on the Internet, the attacker’s success rate naturally grows as the probability for adoption reduces. However, even in this probabilistic deployment scenario, path-end validation yields good results, significantly outperforming BGPsec. For example, for an adoption rate of 50%, path-end validation still provides significant benefits, and the attacker is better off switching to the 2-hop attack with only 60 adopters. BGPsec under a similar scenario provides only marginal 0.2% improvement over RPKI.

This difference between the two defenses against path-manipulation attacks under probabilistic adoption is particularly important when considering the effort required for deployment (see discussion in Section 2): while path-end validation was designed to be easy to deploy and only introduces changes to the BGP router’s configuration, BGPsec requires new hardware and is therefore expected to have a long period until it is extensively deployed [21].

### RPKI in Partial Deployment

RPKI deployment is still far from ubiquitous, with only about 6% of IP prefixes advertised in BGP being in the RPKI repository [37]. Understanding the root causes for RPKI’s slow adoption is beyond the scope of this work and is an important direction for future research. Our focus here is to show that path-end validation can provide benefits without waiting for extensive RPKI deployment.

We use the simulation framework presented in Section 4 to evaluate interdomain routing security when adopters deploy RPKI with path-end validation, but all other ASes deploy neither mechanism.

**Prefix Hijacks:** Since we consider the case where RPKI is very partially deployed, attackers may perform prefix hijacks, i.e., advertise the same prefix as the victim AS, with the plausible excuse of a benign misconfiguration error (when detected) [7]. Although hijacking attacks are blocked by RPKI adopters, they can be very effective when RPKI is insufficiently deployed.

**Security Evaluation:** In Figure 9, we plot the attacker’s success rates when launching a prefix hijack, which is filtered by adopters. (We already quantified path-end validation’s effectiveness against next-AS attacks in Section 4.) The dashed reference line describes the next-AS attacker’s success when RPKI is fully deployed but with no path-end validation deployment. Figure 9a plots the average attacker’s success rate for uniformly chosen attacker and victim pairs. We find that when 20 large ISPs adopt RPKI, the attacker is better off launching a next-hop attack than a prefix hijack to circumvent RPKI. This is where the benefits of path-end validation start to become apparent. We conclude that even in early stages of RPKI adoption, path-end validation can provide tangible security benefits over RPKI. This should be contrasted with the deployment of BGPsec, which relies on extensive RPKI deployment [33]. Similar measurements focusing only on the security benefits for large content providers, described in Figure 9b, show the same trends.

### Handling Other Attacks

Path-end validation focuses on authenticating the 1-AS-hop suffix of a BGP advertisement to protect against next-AS attacks. We next describe two simple extensions to RPKI, designed to defend against other path-manipulation attacks.
