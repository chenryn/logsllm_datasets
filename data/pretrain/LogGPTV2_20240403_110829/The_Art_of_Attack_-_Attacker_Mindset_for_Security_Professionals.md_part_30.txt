breach to an asset theft. On top of this, the threat landscape is evolving
and new technologies are constantly being rolled out. Transformation
is often disguised as evolution, like the “cloud.” Even with this, you
must have the ability to rapidly respond and decisively resolve crises,
providing the most effective deterrents and setting the stage for future
operations where possible. Should deterrence fail, it is imperative that
you be able to defeat attacks of any kind. Especially important is the
ability to deter or defeat simultaneous or nearly simultaneous attacks,
even if they are happening at a distance but occurring in overlapping
time frames— which means the whole organization must be on the
same page, treating security as an absolute. Training and being able to
recognize events for what they are is critical.
The ability to rapidly defeat initial attack advances means you
must be prepared to conduct several smaller- scale contingency
operations so that you can stabilize a situation. All of this proves
that simply having a policy isn’t enough. Communication and care-
ful training, companywide, is called for, and in light of escalating
security breaches, there is a need for decisive, mitigating action that
is swift and effectual.
You will have to recalibrate your security approach from mainly
technology-b ased defenses, including processes and education, to

become proactive. It takes laser focus, commitment, and a sharp,
modern leadership to do so in a way that sticks. This level of com-
munication and ultimately foresight within your organization is the
only way to change habits and culture.
Cybercrime is constantly evolving, and the growing increase in
the number of threats that use social engineering techniques is a
cause for concern in several businesses. All it takes is one user to
click on a malicious link, and a firm’s network can be brought to a
grinding halt. Cyberthreats have increased in large numbers, and
the transaction and compromise time has decreased.
It should be noted that, although sophisticated attackers might
know much of the information contained in this book, most attack-
ers only know it in essence, which is adequate, but not enough to
effect real change in terms of security. Having an in- depth under-
standing of AMs will allow us, always, to be ahead of those less care-
ful, less diligent attackers. This is a massive benefit to our clients,
who depend on us to give them more than a step-b y- step account
of the actions we take to circumvent their defenses. To best protect
them, we should be able to give our clients a comprehensive under-
standing of their whole landscape as we perceive it, not only how
we bypassed some of their defenses arbitrarily. As a business, you
should expect this. For businesses reading, employing AMs affords
you exactly this.
Security as a whole needs to be broken down into the pieces
recognizable to the cultural and technical backdrop you oper-
ate within. There is no one- size- fits- all for security. You must ana-
lyze each piece of your landscape and tooling, identify any faults,
and perform regular maintenance. When it has all been sewn
back together, the hope is that it equals more than the sum of its
parts. You will experience unintended consequences of securing
your business in this way. However, even if your changes do not
seem good at first, it is critical to remember that antifragility comes
through volatility: it’s best you have put that into action rather than
an adversary.
268 AFTER AMs
AMs on the Spectrum
America, possibly tied with the UK and Iran, is a sophisticated
cyber superpower. America is good at offense, but we are also the
most targeted. We have many systems of interest to profit from,
to steal from and to spy on, so we are targeted frequently. We are
one of the most vulnerable from this perspective, too, because we
are one of the most connected—everything is connected, from
our refrigerators to our water treatment facilities. Because of this,
we face many challenges: one is to remain skeptical and honest
in evaluating our utility as attackers— meaning we must also not
become complacent and self- assured that we are ahead of the real
bad guys or that because we can identify what tactics and strategies
have been applied by them in the past we know what they will do
in the future.
As companies engaging AMs experts, you face a similar prob-
lem. Business as a whole can struggle in identifying their own short-
comings and in realistically understanding how and why they will
become targets. Corporate AMs is recognizing this and enlisting
the help of experts. AMs specialist–proficient, unbiased red teams,
pentesters and social engineers with the ability to look at the organ-
ization as a whole do make an irrefutable difference— specifically
when they are correctly scoped, competently structured, and
encouraged to carry out their objectives without improper influ-
ence or constraint. To reiterate: AMs is a way of thinking and acting
that puts ethical attackers in the mind and shoes of the unethical.
In doing so, we, as companies and industries, get to benefit from
their work in the short term (in getting an honest assessment of our
threat landscape, an alternative analysis of our vulnerabilities and
security gaps and the chance to fix our shortcomings) and in the
long term (through sharing information and being able to better
recognize trends, similarities, and how threats evolve).
Your business is subject to the full spectrum of crises—a
spectrum you as a business should understand but of which the
complexities may allude you. AMs requires a distinct way of think-
ing and operating— employing a self- aware, curious, creative,
Staying Protected— The Business 269
confident, agile mentality and maintaining the ability to communi-
cate and explain your organization through their eyes. Their meth-
ods cannot become predictable or culturally ingrained, nor will
they become Complacent with your security and threat landscape.
To help your business combat the full spectrum of threats, ethical
attackers employing AMs will be disruptive, but this is the busi-
ness’s opportunity to become antifragile. Holistically, I believe this
is our function aligned with each businesses. An additive would be
sharing information within the community and subcommunities
to identify trends and patterns more quickly and effectively, speak-
ing for both the attacker in this case and the company. Assuredly,
all data is sensitive data. Through employing the use of AMs, you
will be able to assess more clearly and accurately what can be used
against you and how.
Final Thoughts
Security is a tough task for many organizations. Most aren’t in the
business of security, which makes it hard to think through its lens.
Organizations typically do not build security programs designed
to be robust; they build them with defensive technology and test
them offensively to the best of their ability. This approach can often
fail to consider the users of that technology, their understanding
of security and policy. Additionally, not all attacks use technology.
Social engineering is the practice of using influence, deception and
manipulation to breach security—i t’s human versus human. This is
not solved if defenses amount to firewalls, intrusion detection sys-
tems, patch management, and compliance checks. Attackers, both
ethical and malicious, count on this blind spot and use it to their
advantage.
As an attacker, we are always acting as the adversary for the
greater good of security. We think objectively about the environment
we are aiming to secure, unencumbered by its cultural biases,
internal assumptions, and the information that exists only in its
literature, such as handbooks and mission statements, and not in
270 AFTER AMs
its everyday workings. We know a skewed view of anything will
gain us nothing.
Use AMs to your advantage as an organization. Use our curios-
ity and persistence to gain a new, informed perspective. Use our
wily ways of processing information, even that which seems innoc-
uous, to get smarter on how actual attackers size you up and plan
their attacks. Employ our specific brand of mental agility to show
you how we can adapt to your cultural norms to move around unde-
tected. Finally, use our self-a wareness: we know what we can lever-
age and through that, you can become a self-a ware company that
knows your current limits and your greatest strengths.
Finally, it has become increasingly clear to me that behavioral
and cultural revolution in the realm of security and policy is immi-
nent and, ultimately, business security will not be adequate unless
the focus is centered on people.
Summary
• There is a simple formula to keep ahead of attackers and protect
your business from a faceless, shapeless threat capable of strik-
ing at any time:
Employ tactical and combative methods internally through the
attacker mindset to identify security gaps + (b) be willing to
change, employing corporate humility, to mitigate vulnerabili-
ties and security gaps.
• Attackers will weaponize information for the good of their objec-
tive and every action they take will be in support of the objective;
they will not break pretext and they will strategize and optimize
an attack with only the end in mind. Be ahead of them. Think
like them and mitigate accordingly.
• Start with the end in mind: security.
Staying Protected— The Business 271
Key Message
If you aren’t implementing AMs in some way to benefit your secu-
rity posture, you aren’t taking your own security, your employees’
security, or your customers’ security seriously.
You will not care about the money you should’ve spent on this
type of security when you either cannot make money anymore or
you have to pay a huge fine.
