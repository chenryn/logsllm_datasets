User: It it's possible, of course.
For example - I can download python-dbus like this:
    $ sudo apt-get download python-dbus
But what I should to do next, with this .deb package in my current virtualenv?
Assistant: An alternative solution is to install globally, then followed by allowing the virtualenv to be able to see it.
As an example, let's say we want to install matplotlib for Python 3:

sudo apt update # Update first
sudo apt install python3-matplotlib  # Install globally
sudo pip3 install -U virtualenv  # Install virtualenv for Python 3 using pip3
virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ./venv #the system-site-packages option allows venv to see all global packages including matplotlib
source ./venv/bin/activate #activate the venv to use matplotlib within the virtualenv
deactivate  # don't exit until you're done using the virtualenv
