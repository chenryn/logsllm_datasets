### Title: CDPwn: Exploiting Layer 2 Zero-Days to Compromise Millions of Enterprise Devices

The security vulnerabilities in proprietary Layer 2 protocols are often overlooked by the research community, yet they can have significant implications for the devices and networks that rely on them. Our team has uncovered five zero-day vulnerabilities in a widely used proprietary Layer 2 protocol. This protocol is enabled by default on all affected products and across all ports, significantly expanding the potential attack surface.

**Threat to Network Appliances:**
The first set of vulnerabilities targets enterprise-grade switches and routers from multiple vendors. These network appliances are critical assets, as they provide access to all network segments and are ideally positioned for traffic exfiltration. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain full control over the network appliance, enabling lateral movement between the VLANs it serves and effectively breaking network segmentation.

**Threat to IP Phones and IP Cameras:**
The second set of vulnerabilities affects a large number of IP phones and IP cameras, with tens of millions of these devices in use globally by both individuals and organizations. By sending a specially crafted broadcast packet, an attacker can simultaneously take over all IP phones and cameras in a network. Once compromised, these devices can be used to eavesdrop on calls and view video feeds, creating a powerful spying tool.

**Demonstration:**
In our presentation, we will demonstrate both attack scenarios. We will show the full impact of compromising an organization's enterprise switch and the alarming potential of a single packet to take over enterprise-grade IP phones and cameras. Our goal is to highlight the severity of these vulnerabilities and the importance of addressing them to ensure the security of enterprise networks.
