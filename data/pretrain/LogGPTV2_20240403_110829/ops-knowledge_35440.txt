User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I convince my boss that storing third party passwords in plaintext is a bad idea? Keeping things vague - I work at a company that handles compliance issues for our clients. Very often, this means we need to log onto their various accounts for various entities. We store their username and password, both to make it easier for them to remember and have access to, and for us to be able to log onto their account. 

Ignoring the complete and total security nightmare of sharing logins for a minute, the username and passwords appear to be stored in plaintext. Hurray.

How can I convince my boss, and the higher ups, that A) This is a terrible idea, B) a better method/way of storing these

Assistant: Why is it a terrible idea?

By recording others' login credentials, the company is taking upon itself a liability. Since the company is now responsible for malice that could occur using those credentials, the company should take steps to minimize the risk. In addition, companies that interact with yours have to take upon the liability of trusting you, something that can harm business if an incident goes public (as mentioned by symcbean)

Storing passwords in plaintext (as you know) provides no protection against that risk.

What is a better solution?

As you mentioned in a comment, what you need is something like a password manager. In fact, what you want is a password manager.

Since there is a lot of room for error when it comes to cryptography, I suggest using an established password manager. You can find countless comparisons online, but in the end your choices include ones based around a GUI (like 1password, LastPass, keepass, etc) or one based an cli for automated access (like pass or via the LastPass cli)
