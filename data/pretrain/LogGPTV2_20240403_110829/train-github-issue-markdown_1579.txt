    1. What is a short input program that triggers the error?
    import "fmt"
    const FE = "xFE"
    func main() {
       fmt.Println(uint8(string(254)[0]))
    }
    2. What is the full compiler output?
    missed typecheck [2b5b15067950]
    .   LITERAL-I120 u(1) a(1) x(0+0) uint8
    prog.go:8: internal compiler error: missed typecheck
    3. What version of the compiler are you using?  (Run it with the -V flag.)
