In our scheme (II), the proposed signcryption algorithm is based on “Sign-
then-Encrypt” methodology, which can be viewed as the standard version of
Boyen’s ID-based signcryption algorithm [6]. Therefore, we have
Theorem 2. In the random oracle, the proposed signcryption algorithm in our
scheme (II) is semantically secure against adaptively chosen ciphertext attacks
and unforgeable secure against adaptively chosen message attacks based on the
assumption BDHP is intractable.
Theorem 3. Our proposed LVS schemes are both satisfy the property of non-
transferability based on the assumption of BDHP is intractable.
Proof. Firstly, the third party can be convinced by the proof that the signer
indeed generate a signature. From the result of [26], we know that it is impossible
for the limited veriﬁer to forge a universal designated veriﬁer signature to cheat
the Judge.
Secondly, the Judge cannot transfer the proof to convince any other party.
In scheme (I), the proof is the pair (a, d). We have proved that the Judge is
fully able to generate an indistinguishable pair. In scheme (II), the proof is just
a universal designated veriﬁer signature. Therefore, the non-transferability of
(cid:6)(cid:7)
both schemes is obvious.

5.2 Eﬃciency
We compare the eﬃciency of our schemes with that of Araki et al.’s scheme. In
Table 1, we denote P the pairings operation, M the point scalar multiplication
in G1, E exponentiation in G2 and R reversion in Zq. We ignore other operations
such as hash in all schemes.

In Araki et al.’s scheme, both of the conﬁrmation and denial protocol need
rounds of interactive communication. However, the conﬁrmation protocol in our
schemes is performed in a non-interactive manner. Moreover, our scheme does
not require the denial protocol. The Judge can be convinced by a proof that
the signer indeed generated a signature. Because the proposed scheme can be
converted into an ordinary one for public veriﬁcation when necessary, the signer
cannot repudiate his signature.
Suppose the length of a point in G1 is |q|, and the length of an element of
G2 and the message m is |p|. Table 2 presents the comparison of communication
cost between Araki et al.’s scheme and ours.

6 Conclusions
The ordinary digital signature provides the functions of integration, authenti-
cation, and non-repudiation for the signed message. Anyone can verify the sig-
nature with the signer’s public key. However, it is unnecessary for anyone to be
convinced the validity of the signature in some situations. It is suﬃcient for a
designated recipient, who will try to preserve the signer’s privacy if the signer
follow some speciﬁed rules, to verify the signature. Limited veriﬁer signature was
introduced to solve this problem. If the signer violated the rules, the designated

recipient (namely, limited veriﬁer) can provide a proof to convince a judge that
the signer indeed generated the signature for the message. Also, the limited ver-
iﬁer can also convert the signature into an ordinary one for public veriﬁcation
when necessary. In this paper, we ﬁrstly present the precise deﬁnition and clear
security notions for (convertible) limited veriﬁer signature, and then propose
two new (convertible) limited veriﬁer signature schemes from bilinear pairings.
Moreover, we proved that our schemes achieved the desired security notions in
the random oracle.
In our schemes, the conﬁrmation protocol does not need the interactive com-
munication and the conversion does not need the cooperation of the original
signer. Therefore, they are much eﬃcient than previous scheme.
