  * VSCode Version: 0.10.11
  * OS Version: OS X 10.11.4
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. All I have to do is open Visual Studio Code and it will give me these error. I am not able to save, and some of the keyboard commands don't work such as backspace.
Troubleshooting:
  1. I've deleted all my extensions from `~/.vscode/extensions` but still experience the same errors.
  2. I've completely uninstalled VS Code by using App Cleaner to make sure I got every app file possible, yet it still gave errors after I installed a fresh copy from the website.

**EDIT:** Actually... I think I may have found the issue. This happens when I
open a remote file from within FileZilla by right clicking on the **remote**
filename and clicking on view/edit. What this does is open the file in VSCode
and shows the temp location of the file as a very long string.
I feel like it may be this that is causing the issue because after downloading
the file and **then** opening it, everything is working fine.
Is there any log that I can submit to see if I'm right?
