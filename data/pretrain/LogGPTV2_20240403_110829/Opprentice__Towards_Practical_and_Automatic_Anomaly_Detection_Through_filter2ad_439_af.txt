In addition, although machine learning is a promising
solution, applying it in designing a practical system needs to
be careful as it presents several interesting challenges, such as
imbalance class and irrelevant and redundant features. We explore
and solve some of them in this paper. We believe that Opprentice
provides a new schema to bridge the gap between practical opera-
tional demands and the state-of-art anomaly detectors. In our future
work, we plan to work on the several issues mentioned in §6, and
apply the idea of Opprentice to other network operation tasks such
as automating intrusion detection and network troubleshooting.
