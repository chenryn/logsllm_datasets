User: Is there official documentation on the Python website somewhere, on how to install and run multiple versions of Python on the same machine on Linux?
I can find gazillions of blog posts and answers, but I want to know if there is a "standard" official way of doing this?
Or is this all dependent on OS?
Assistant: On Windows they get installed to separate folders, "C:\python26" and "C:\python31", but the executables have the same "python.exe" name.  
I created another "C:\python" folder that contains "python.bat" and "python3.bat" that serve as wrappers to "python26" and "python31" respectively, and added "C:\python" to the PATH environment variable.  
This allows me to type python or python3 in my .bat Python wrappers to start the one I desire.
On Linux, you can use the #! trick to specify which version you want a script to use.
