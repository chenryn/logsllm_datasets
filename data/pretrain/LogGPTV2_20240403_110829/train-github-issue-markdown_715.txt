# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
The application will now be accessible for download as an .exe file, independent of the Windows Store. This change is crucial because, due to company policies, I am unable to use the app in my work environment, where it is most needed.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
The app can be distributed as an .exe setup file that includes an auto-update feature. This will ensure that users always have the latest version of the application, even when they are not using the Windows Store.
