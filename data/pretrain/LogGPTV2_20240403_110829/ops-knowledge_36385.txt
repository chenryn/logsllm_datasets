User: I use

python 2.7 
pyodbc module
google app engine 1.7.1

I can use pydobc with python but the Google App Engine can't load the module. I get a no module named pydobc error.
How can I fix this error or how can use MS-SQL database with my local Google App Engine.
Assistant: You could, at least in theory, replicate your data from the MS-SQL to the Google Cloud SQL database. It is possible create triggers in the MS-SQL database so that every transaction is reflected on your App Engine application via a REST API you will have to build.
