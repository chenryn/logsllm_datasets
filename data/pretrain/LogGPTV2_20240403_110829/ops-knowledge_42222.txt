User: How to run celery worker on Windows without creating Windows Service? Is there any analogy to $ celery -A your_application worker?
Assistant: It's done the same way as in Linux. Changing directory to module containing celery task and calling "c:\python\python" -m celery -A module.celery worker worked well.
