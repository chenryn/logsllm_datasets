and j ~ 52 for the NERSC Seaborg system is not estimated
due to the divergence problem in solving the 2-dimensional
linear equation with the Newton-Raphson method. For the
in-house system and the LANL HPC system, some esti(cid:173)
mated values are rejected, whereas the value is estimated
without rejection in the case of the NERSC Seaborg sys(cid:173)
tem. More precisely, the values for the time period 37 ~ j ~
82, 102 ~ j ~ 141, and 196 ~ j ~ 261 for the in-house sys(cid:173)
tem and 8 ~ j ~ 2097 for LANL HPC system are rejected,
where j denotes the time index (Le. the number of samples
used to estimate the T -year return values).
Although the estimated T -year return values fluctuates
over tilne, the fluctuations of the T -year return value are
smaller than those of the sample average of the repair times
shown in Figure 4. Also, Figure 6 (c) shows some periods
when the estilnated value does not fluctuate at all. This sug(cid:173)
gests that the estimation of the T -year return value for the
NERSC Seaborg system is robust. The estimated T -year re(cid:173)
turn value for the LANL HPC system declines slowly while
that for the in-house system and the NERSC Seaborg sys(cid:173)
tem are statistically stable over time. We think that this slow
convergence is due to the multitude of the observed samples
of the LANL HPC system.
5 Conclusion
It requires large numbers of data samples to study the
statistical properties of repair times. We studied the tail dis(cid:173)
tribution of repair times for three large IT systems using
systematically collected data. We found that repair times of
three different IT systems have quasi-heavy-tailed distribu(cid:173)
tions. This suggests that the sample repair time estimated
at a certain time could change dramatically if we observe
the IT system in some period. In fact, we have seen that the
sample mean and the sample variance of the repair times
of the three IT systelTIS have large fluctuations and do not
appear to converge over several years.
Since the mean time to repair is not a robust metric for
evaluating the availability of an IT system, a new method
to evaluate the system availability with the T -year return
value is proposed. We calculated the T -year return value
for the three IT systems by modeling the repair time with
the Generalized Pareto distribution. The I-year return value
and I-month return value for the three systems are found
to be close to those of the expected values, which suggests
that the T -year return value calculated as in this paper can
reliably predict the value that the repair time exceeds on
