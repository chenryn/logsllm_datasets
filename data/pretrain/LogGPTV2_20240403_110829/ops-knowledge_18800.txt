User: Analyze types of cyber attacks and provide preventive measures.
Assistant: 1. DDos attack prevention measures: a. Install a firewall. b. Configure DOS attack protection equipment, focusing on blacklist IPs for various abnormal traffic. c. Modify the default port to limit the access frequency of the same IP. d. Cooperate with ISP for protection. e. Establish load balancing equipment, which can not only prevent DDOS attacks, but also help website content respond to user requests quickly. 2. Preventive measures for SQL injection: a. Filter and verify user input information. b. Perform error nesting processing on all codes involving database operations in the program. c. Turn off the error prompt of the program, and direct the error information to the system log file when the program makes an error. d. Use the prepared defense script or use the defense mechanism of the database itself when necessary. e. Upgrade, update and patch the database software in time. 3. XSS attack prevention measures: a. Filter and escape the user input information. b. Use HTTPS/SSL to prevent information from being tampered with or cracked. c. Turn off the browser's automatic form submission function. d. Check and update all JavaScript code used in the program to avoid using known vulnerabilities. e. Monitor all target files from the network, especially in file upload pages. 4. CSRF attack prevention measures: a. Fix the loopholes in the program. b. Use protection measures, such as CSRF Token. c. Add verification codes to strengthen user authentication and avoid automated attacks. d. Limit all possible operations to POST submission, and perform a second confirmation on the POST request. e. Configure HTTP header files to avoid user data leakage and ensure website security. 5. Information Leakage Prevention Measures: a. Access Restrictions. For sensitive information within the company, an access authority system is established to strictly limit access by unauthorized users. b. Data plane encryption. For sensitive information, it is recommended to encrypt during transmission, especially when information is transmitted on a public network, technologies such as VPN should be used to encrypt transmission. c. Domain Separation. Sensitive data and platform architecture should be separated to avoid data leakage due to platform architecture being attacked. d. Periodic security audits. Regularly monitor and analyze website security issues, and update, repair and optimize. 6. Penetration attack prevention measures: a. Verify password strength. The password should not be too simple. Changing the password habitually can effectively improve the security of the password. b. Establish a multi-layer identity authentication mechanism. Restrictions are placed on the user registration page, requiring users to provide detailed identity information, and verifying user identities through various channel services to ensure that it is difficult for bad actors to fake their identities. c. Check the program code to prevent hackers from hacking due to random modification of the program code by internal employees. Code audits, error checking, and vulnerability analysis should be performed on a regular basis. d. Implement data encryption and data backup technology to ensure data security. Data encryption not only provides a strong bulwark against cyber-attacks, but also makes the system invulnerable if compromised, which increases the availability of the website. e. Establish a complete system monitoring and visual management model to discover and quickly deal with network attacks to prevent further damage.
