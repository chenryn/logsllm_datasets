I'm getting an issue where throwing an unhandled error turns into an infinite
loop because the guarded callback wrapper fails to extract the error from the
event:

This causes the reconciler to ignore the error, thus triggering it again.
To reproduce, I flipped `useSyncScheduling` to `false` in `ReactDOMFiber` (not
sure if that was important), started `examples/real-world` from Redux and
added a `throw` to its `User` component.
