Question: Consider a software module designed to aggregate customer profiles. The module includes an object that represents a customer profile with the following sub-elements: Personal Information, Account Details, Preferences, Transaction History, and Related Accounts. Each sub-element is a complex data type containing additional structures. What are the potential implications of this design on the software's performance and security?
"A": "The design may lead to performance issues due to the complexity and size of the customer profile object.",
"B": "The design simplifies the data model and is likely to enhance the overall performance of the software.",
"C": "If an attacker can interact with the code handling the customer profiles, the performance issues could be exploited to introduce vulnerabilities.",
"D": "The use of complex data types for sub-elements ensures faster data retrieval and processing, thus improving the software's security."
