Ensuring That Distributed ppm Is Not Disabled
By default, the router’s period packet management process (ppm) runs sessions distributed to the Packet
Forwarding Engine in addition to the Routing Engine. This process is responsible for periodic
transmission of packets on behalf of its various client processes, such as Bidirectional Forwarding
Detection (BFD), and it also receives packets on behalf of client processes.
In addition, ppm handles time-sensitive periodic processing and performs such processes as sending
process-specific packets and gathering statistics. With ppm processes running distributed on both the
Routing Engine and the Packet Forwarding Engine, you can run such processes as BFD on the Packet
Forwarding Engine.
Distributed ppm Required for ETH-DM
Ethernet frame delay measurement requires that ppm remains distributed to the Packet Forwarding
Engine. If ppm is not distributed to the Packet Forwarding Engines of both routers, ETH-DM PDU frame
timestamps and ETH-DM statistics are not valid.
Before you start ETH-DM, you must verify that the following configuration statement is NOT present:
[edit]
routing-options {
ppm {
no-delegate-processing;
236
}
}
If distributed ppm processing is disabled (as shown in the stanza above) on either router, you must re-
enable it in order to use the ETH-DM feature.
Procedure to Ensure that Distributed ppm is Not Disabled
To ensure that distributed ppm is not disabled on a router:
1. Display the packet processing management (PPM) configuration to determine whether distributed ppm
is disabled.
• In the following example, distributed ppm is enabled on the router. In this case, you do not need to
modify the router configuration:
[edit]
user@host# show routing-options
ppm;
• In the following example, distributed ppm is disabled on the router. In this case, you must proceed
to Step 2 to modify the router configuration:
[edit]
user@host show routing-options
ppm {
no-delegate-processing;
}
2. Modify the router configuration to re-enable distributed ppm and restart the Ethernet OAM
Connectivity Fault Management process ONLY IF distributed ppm is disabled (as determined in the
previous step).
a. Before continuing, make any necessary preparations for the possible loss of connectivity on the
router.
Restarting the ethernet-connectivity-fault-management process has the following effect on your
network:
• All connectivity fault management (CFM) sessions re-establish.
• All ETH-DM requests on the router terminate.
237
• All ETH-DM statistics and frame counts reset to 0.
b. Modify the router configuration to re-enable distributed ppm. For example:
[edit]
user@host# delete routing-options ppm no-delegate-processing
c. Commit the updated router configuration. For example:
[edit]
user@host# commit and-quit
commit complete
exiting configuration mode
d. To restart the Ethernet OAM Connectivity-Fault-Management process, enter the restart ethernet-
connectivity-fault-management  operational mode command. For
example:
user@host> restart ethernet-connectivity-fault-management
Connectivity fault management process started, pid 9893
Connectivity fault management (CFM) sessions operate in centralized mode over AE interfaces by
default. Y.1731 performance monitoring (PM) is supported on centralized CFM sessions over AE
interfaces. Also, distribution of CFM session over AE interfaces to line cards is supported from Junos OS
Release 13.3. To enable the distribution of CFM sessions and to operate in centralized mode, include the
ppm delegate-processing statement at the [edit routing-options ppm] hierarchy level. The mechanism that
enables distribution of CFM sessions over AE interfaces provides the underlying infrastructure to
support PM over AE interfaces. In addition, periodic packet management (PPM) handles time-sensitive
periodic processing and performs such processes as sending process-specific packets and gathering
statistics. With PPM processes running distributed on both the Routing Engine and the Packet
Forwarding Engine, you can run performance monitoring processes on the Packet Forwarding Engine.

Enabling the Hardware-Assisted Timestamping Option
By default, Ethernet frame delay measurement uses software for timestamping transmitted and received
ETH-DM frames. For Ethernet interfaces, you can optionally use hardware timing to assist in the
timestamping of received ETH-DM frames to increase the accuracy of delay measurements.
Enabling hardware-assisted timestamping of received frames can increase the accuracy of ETH-DM
calculations when the DPC is loaded with heavy traffic in the receive direction.
Starting in Junos OS Release 20.4R1, by default the hardware assistance is used for timestamping
Ethernet frame delay frames on AFT based MX Series line cards, even if the hardware-assisted-timestamping
is not configured.
To enable Ethernet frame delay measurement hardware assistance on the reception path, include the
hardware-assisted-timestamping statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management
performance-monitoring] hierarchy level:
[edit protocols]
oam {
ethernet {
connectivity-fault-management {
performance-monitoring {
hardware-assisted-timestamping;
}
}
}
}
SEE ALSO
hardware-assisted-timestamping
Configuring the Server-Side Processing Option
You can delegate the server-side processing (for both two-way delay measurement and loss
measurement) to the Packet Forwarding Engine to prevent overloading on the Routing Engine. By
default, the server-side processing is done by the Routing Engine.
To configure the server-side processing option:
239
1. In configuration mode, go to the following hierarchy level:
user@host# edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring
2. Configure the server-side processing option.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring]
user@host# set delegate-server-processing
3. Verify the configuration.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
user@host# show
performance-monitoring {
delegate-server-processing;
}

Triggering an Ethernet Frame Delay Measurements Session
Before Ethernet frame delay measurement statistics can be displayed, they must be collected. To trigger
Ethernet frame delay measurement, use the monitor ethernet delay-measurement (one-way | two-way) (remote-
mac-address) maintenance-domain name maintenance-association ma-id [count count] [wait time] operational
command.
The fields for this command are described in Table 15 on page 240.

Using the monitor ethernet delay-measurement Command
After you have configured two MX Series routers to support ITU-T Y.1731 Ethernet frame delay
measurement (ETH-DM), you can initiate a one-way or two-way Ethernet frame delay measurement
session from the CFM maintenance association end point (MEP) on one of the routers to the peer MEP
on the other router.
To start an ETH-DM session between the specified local MEP and the specified remote MEP, enter the
monitor ethernet delay-measurement command at operational mode. The syntax of the command is as follows:
monitor ethernet delay-measurement
(one-way | two-way)
maintenance-domain md-name
maintenance-association ma-name
(remote-mac-address | mep remote-mep-id)
For a one-way frame delay measurement, the command displays a runtime display of the number of
1DM frames sent from the initiator MEP during that ETH-DM session. One-way frame delay and frame
delay variation measurements from an ETH-DM session are collected in a CFM database at the router
that contains the receiver MEP. You can retrieve ETH-DM statistics from a CFM database at a later time.
242
For a two-way frame delay measurement, the command displays two-way frame delay and frame delay
variation values for each round-trip frame exchange during that ETH-DM session, as well as a runtime
display of useful summary information about the session: average delay, average delay variation, best-
case delay, and worst-case delay. Two-way frame delay and frame delay variation values measurements
from an ETH-DM session are collected in a CFM database at the router that contains the initiator MEP.
You can retrieve ETH-DM statistics from a CFM database at a later time.
NOTE: Although you can trigger frame delay collection for up to 65,535 ETH-DM requests at a
time, a router stores only the last 100 frame delay statistics per CFM session (pair of peer MEPs).
For a complete description of the monitor ethernet delay-measurement operational command, see the CLI
Explorer.

Starting a One-Way ETH-DM Session
To start a one-way Ethernet frame delay measurement session, enter the monitor ethernet delay-measurement
one-way command from operational mode, and specify the peer MEP by its MAC address or by its MEP
identifier.
For example:
user@host> monitor ethernet delay-measurement one-way 00:05:85:73:39:4a maintenance-domain md6
maintenance-association ma6 count 10
One-way ETH-DM request to 00:05:85:73:39:4a, Interface xe-5/0/0.0

to explicitly quit the monitor ethernet delay-measurement command and return to the CLI command
prompt.
