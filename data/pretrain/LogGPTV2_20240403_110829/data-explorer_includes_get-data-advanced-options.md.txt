### Advanced options based on data type
**Tabular (CSV, TSV, PSV)**:
* If you're ingesting tabular formats in an *existing table*, you can select **Advanced** > **Keep current table schema**. Tabular data doesn't necessarily include the column names that are used to map source data to the existing columns. When this option is checked, mapping is done by-order, and the table schema remains the same. If this option is unchecked, new columns are created for incoming data, regardless of data structure.
* To use the first row as column names, select  **Advanced** > **First row is column header**.

**JSON**:
* To determine column division of JSON data, select **Advanced** > **Nested levels**, from 1 to 100. 
* If you select **Advanced** > **Ignore data format errors**, the data is ingested in JSON format. If you leave this check box unselected, the data is ingested in multijson format.
