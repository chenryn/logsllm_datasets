User: Why is using HTTPS more secure than HTTP? Please briefly explain why.
Assistant: Because HTTPS uses the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt and authenticate data, thereby ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of user data transmission. Compared with HTTP, HTTPS uses public key cryptography to encrypt and transmit data, so that middlemen cannot obtain user data content and prevent information from being intercepted, tampered with, and leaked. In addition, HTTPS can also verify the identity of the website, ensure that the website is legal and credible, and prevent users from being attacked by phishing and fraud.
