**ATT&CK ID:** S1044  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** FunnyDream

FunnyDream compresses collected files using zLib and encrypts them with an XOR operation. The encryption key is either provided as a command-line argument or, if no key is specified, defaults to the string "qwerasdf". Additionally, file names are obfuscated using the same key that is used for encrypting the compressed file content.[13]
