titleblackhat:us-21 A Survivor-Centric, Trauma-Informed Approach to Stalkerware
Stalkerware is a type of spyware that is often used to surveil intimate partners or ex-partners. While it has been around for many years, its use has seen an uptick in recent years, with some studies suggesting a particular increase during the COVID-19 pandemic.Technically, stalkerware is not particularly interesting: it is (primarily mobile) spyware and technically on par with commercial malware. But stalkerware is part of a broader ecosystem of technology-enabled abuse and coercive control, and therefore, technical means play only a small part in addressing it.In this presentation, we will explain what stalkerware is, how it works and under what pretense it is often marketed and sold. More importantly, we will explain that stalkerware is part of the much wider problem of technology-enabled abuse and coercive control, such as intimate partner violence (IPV), domestic abuse, harassment, stalking, sexual violence, and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV). A holistic understanding of abuse and coercive control and the psychological harms experienced by survivors is essential for anyone who may encounter stalkerware and similar forms of tech misuse and abuse in their professional or personal lives.The presentation will conclude with suggestions on what individual security practitioners can do when they encounter stalkerware, as well as what the security industry can do about stalkerware and tech abuse in general.
