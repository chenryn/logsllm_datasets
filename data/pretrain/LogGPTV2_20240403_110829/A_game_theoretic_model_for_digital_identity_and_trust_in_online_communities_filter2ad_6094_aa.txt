Abstract
The Sharing Economy (SE) is a growing ecosystem focusing on peer-to-peer enterprise. In
the SE the information available to assist individuals (users) in making decisions focuses
predominantly on community-generated trust and reputation information. However, how
such information impacts user judgement is still being understood. To explore such effects,
we constructed an artificial SE accommodation platform where we varied the elements
related to hosts’ digital identity, measuring users’ perceptions and decisions to interact.
Across three studies, we find that trust and reputation information increases not only the
users’ perceived trustworthiness, credibility, and sociability of hosts, but also the propensity
to rent a private room in their home. This effect is seen when providing users both with com-
plete profiles and profiles with partial user-selected information. Closer investigations reveal
that three elements relating to the host’s digital identity are sufficient to produce such posi-
tive perceptions and increased rental decisions, regardless of which three elements are pre-
sented. Our findings have relevant implications for human judgment and privacy in the SE,
and question its current culture of ever increasing information-sharing.
Introduction
Background
The Sharing Economy (SE) describes a growing ecosystem of online platforms devoted to the
exchange of goods and services [1–4]. While a precise and encompassing definition of “sharing
economy” is still debated within academia and business [2,5,6], the concept is grounded in
peer-to-peer (P2P) enterprise, providing individuals with temporary access to the resources of
other individuals [7], while using the platforms simply as an exchange mediator [3,8]. In this
respect, despite sharing its peer-to-peer nature with other online environments (such as e-
commerce websites), the SE represents a distinctly unique concept.

Digital Identity and user judgment
The SE has seen fantastic growth and high adoption rates among the general population
[5], creating value on an unprecedented scale [3,9], and rivaling well established sectors of the
traditional economy [10]. The types of platforms that have emerged around the SE paradigm
range across all domains and markets, from accommodation (e.g., Airbnb) and taxi services
(e.g., Uber) to household appliances (e.g., Zilok) and clothes (e.g., GirlMeetsDress).
Trust and reputation
In most marketplaces, individuals are aware that the services they request are subject to regula-
tions, consumer protection laws, and monitoring by governmental bodies, ensuring a degree
of liability, security, and safety. Within the SE, such protections are reduced [5], as SE plat-
forms offer direct and largely unmediated interaction between individuals who have never met
before neither offline nor online [1,3]. SE operations require a high level of trust on behalf of
all parties involved [11], which needs to be established on a personal level that goes well
beyond the mere exchange of goods, in the absence of indicators typically employed to signal
quality or reliability in traditional markets. In this respect, trust in the SE differs significantly
from the trust associated to other forms of online economic exchange, such as business-to-
consumer and consumer-to-consumer e-commerce [2,6,12].
In recent years, the role of trust in the online environment has received significant attention
[13–19]. While its precise definitions may vary depending on the context, here trust refers to
the psychological state reflecting the willingness of an actor to place themselves in a vulnerable
situation with respect to the actions/intentions of another actor, in the absence of a direct abil-
ity to monitor or control the other party [20,21]. Thus, trust always involves some aspect of
risk, uncertainty, vulnerability, and the expectation of reciprocation.
By extension, the ability to infer the trustworthiness of the individuals with whom users
wish to engage is fundamental to the SE’s operation [11,22–26]. This process is typically facili-
tated by requiring SE users to establish a digital identity (DI; namely, what the user decides to
share on the platform and the information generated by the community, see the next Section).
Hence, following Todorov and colleagues [27,28], throughout this paper we operationalize
trust in the SE in terms of the perceived trustworthiness of its users, and how this is affected by
the information they share on SE platforms. For the sake of brevity, throughout the paper our
discussions regarding the roles and effects of trust refer to this concept of trustworthiness.
Individuals in the SE (i.e. users), themselves, gravitate towards information relating to the
trustworthiness of the individuals they wish to engage with before deciding to interact [29–31].
Furthermore, research has shown that trust, in turn, has a significant impact on user decision-
making and behavior [13,15,17,32].
Another component driving user behavior within the SE is user reputation. Reputation in
the SE reflects the perception the community has towards a user, through their longevity on a
platform, contributions to the community, and outcome of past engagements (typically, repre-
sented as numeric or valence scores). Reputation can be considered an aggregate representa-
tion of trust towards a certain individual or entity. Thus, in the SE a good reputation can
effectively perform a regulatory role conducive to trust [25,31]. All in all, trust and reputation
can be considered the most valuable commodities within the SE [3,33,34].
Trust and reputation information are relevant due to the implicit information asymmetry
and economic risks of SE platforms, forcing users to rely on such elements to inform their
decision-making [29,33,35,36]. The success of such a market relies on its ability to reduce
uncertainty in its P2P interactions [3]. In such markets, often, the only source that allow people
to infer the credibility of another user is to relying on their digital identify information. Thus,
trust is crucial for turning a user’s uncertainty into a definitive request to use a service [22].

Digital Identity and user judgment
Digital identity
DI is often used as a blanket term encompassing the overall online footprint of a given entity,
be it an individual or a company. While in general DI is undoubtedly a complex and multiface-
ted concept, in the SE setting it acquires a rather precise meaning, which arises from the inter-
play of the information SE users willingly share and the information their peers share about
their past interactions with them.
At the core of any SE platform are systems that provide reputation building information
[37], which typically aggregate subjective user generated content (UGC) into a reputation
score; this in turn forms the core of a user’s DI on the platform. Most SE platforms actively
promote mechanisms through which users can share information, rate others, and build a rep-
utation on the platform. Such content usually takes the form of numerical (e.g., ratings
between 1 and 5) and text reviews. Each user has to carefully consider the reputation they fos-
ter within the community, ensuring that their identity convinces others that they are trustwor-
thy and would want to interact with them.
Depending on the platform, the above information is typically complemented with more
objective data through which users can signal trust and build relationships [38]. These include,
but are not limited to, identity verification, photos of sellers and their goods, and sellers’ con-
tact information [39]. The combination of these two types of systems acts to reduce the
implicit uncertainty of operating in such markets [20,23,40]. Yet, still little is known about
how SE users incorporate such information into their decision-making processes.
Aims & research questions
The central research question we address is whether DI impacts the perceived trustworthiness
of SE users. In particular, our goal is to investigate whether SE users are able to integrate the
wealth of available information on their peers’ profiles when deciding with whom to interact.
Our initial hypothesis is twofold. On one hand, we hypothesized that SE users are strongly
affected by the presence of trust and reputation information (TRI), leading to changes in their
judgements towards hosts and the services they offer, possibly without even realizing the
strength of such effects. Yet, the literature on decision making [41–44] informs us that people
often are incapable of integrating information from multiple sources, and unwittingly make
decisions based on a limited number of cues (typically two or three). We expect the same phe-
nomenon to take place in the SE as well, i.e., we hypothesized that SE users’ judgments are
unaffected by the increase in the available information shown on their peers’ profiles above a
certain amount.
We tested these hypotheses by designing an artificial accommodation platform, which
allowed us complete control over the type and amount of information displayed to users.
Hypothetical decision-making scenarios allow the experimental investigation of actual deci-
sion-making processes, and findings from them have been generally found to be consistent
with field-collected data [45]. The profiles were generated to resemble accommodation SE
platforms (e.g., Airbnb). Our choice was motivated by the rise of the SE being historically
driven by a handful of companies, Airbnb being the most globally prominent of them. In this
respect, our choice facilitated ecological validity and the participants’ awareness of the experi-
mental context. Over three experiments, individuals (users) were presented with profiles
reflecting hosts wishing to rent a private room in their house. The aim was to understand
whether the TRI available on hosts’ profiles has an effect on users’ decisions to rent a private
room advertised by a host.
Our first study was exploratory and aimed at collecting data of SE users’ choice patterns.
Indeed, Study 1 assessed the effect of providing users with different amounts of host related

TRI. This contrasted host profiles containing minimal information (akin to those of new users
on a platform), with profiles containing the full information typically seen on such sites, and
with profiles where the information presented was user-selected (allowing for some under-
standing of the users’ underlying thought processes).
