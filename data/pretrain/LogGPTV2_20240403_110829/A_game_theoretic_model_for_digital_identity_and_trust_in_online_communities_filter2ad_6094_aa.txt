## Abstract

The Sharing Economy (SE) is a rapidly growing ecosystem that focuses on peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. In this environment, users rely heavily on community-generated trust and reputation information to make decisions. However, the impact of such information on user judgement remains underexplored. To investigate these effects, we developed an artificial SE accommodation platform where we manipulated elements related to hosts' digital identities and measured users' perceptions and decisions to interact. Across three studies, we found that trust and reputation information not only enhances users' perceived trustworthiness, credibility, and sociability of hosts but also increases their likelihood of renting a private room. This effect was observed whether users were provided with complete profiles or partial, user-selected information. Further analysis revealed that presenting just three elements of a host's digital identity is sufficient to produce positive perceptions and increased rental decisions, regardless of which specific elements are shown. Our findings have significant implications for understanding human judgment and privacy in the SE and challenge the current culture of extensive information-sharing.

## Introduction

### Background

The Sharing Economy (SE) refers to a growing ecosystem of online platforms that facilitate the exchange of goods and services. While a precise definition of the "sharing economy" is still debated within academia and business, it is fundamentally based on P2P transactions, providing temporary access to resources owned by other individuals, with the platforms serving as intermediaries. Despite sharing similarities with other online environments, such as e-commerce websites, the SE is a distinct concept due to its P2P nature.

### Digital Identity and User Judgment

The SE has experienced remarkable growth and high adoption rates, creating value on an unprecedented scale and rivaling established sectors of the traditional economy. SE platforms span various domains, including accommodation (e.g., Airbnb), taxi services (e.g., Uber), household appliances (e.g., Zilok), and clothing (e.g., GirlMeetsDress).

#### Trust and Reputation

In traditional marketplaces, regulations, consumer protection laws, and government oversight provide a degree of security and safety. In the SE, such protections are limited, as platforms offer direct, largely unmediated interactions between individuals who have never met. Trust is crucial in the SE, requiring a personal level of confidence that goes beyond the typical indicators of quality and reliability in traditional markets. Trust in the SE differs significantly from trust in other forms of online economic exchange, such as business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer e-commerce.

Trust, in this context, refers to the psychological state reflecting the willingness of an actor to place themselves in a vulnerable situation with respect to another actor, without the ability to directly monitor or control the other party. Trust involves risk, uncertainty, vulnerability, and the expectation of reciprocation. The ability to infer the trustworthiness of individuals is fundamental to the SE's operation. This process is facilitated by the establishment of a digital identity (DI), which includes the information users share and the feedback generated by the community.

Reputation in the SE reflects the community's perception of a user, based on their longevity, contributions, and past engagements. A good reputation can perform a regulatory role, fostering trust. Trust and reputation are the most valuable commodities in the SE, reducing uncertainty and economic risks. The success of the SE depends on its ability to reduce uncertainty in P2P interactions, often relying on digital identity information as the primary source of credibility.

#### Digital Identity

Digital identity (DI) encompasses the overall online footprint of an individual or company. In the SE, DI is more specific, arising from the interplay of information users share and the feedback from their peers. SE platforms typically provide systems for building and aggregating reputation, often in the form of numerical ratings and text reviews. Users must carefully manage their reputation to appear trustworthy and desirable to others.

Some platforms complement subjective data with objective information, such as identity verification, photos, and contact details. This combination helps reduce the uncertainty inherent in SE transactions. However, little is known about how users incorporate this information into their decision-making processes.

### Aims & Research Questions

Our central research question is whether DI impacts the perceived trustworthiness of SE users. Specifically, we aim to investigate whether users can integrate the available information on their peers' profiles when deciding whom to interact with. We hypothesized that users are strongly influenced by trust and reputation information (TRI), leading to changes in their judgments. Additionally, we hypothesized that users' judgments are unaffected by the increase in available information above a certain threshold.

To test these hypotheses, we designed an artificial accommodation platform, allowing us to control the type and amount of information displayed. Over three experiments, participants were presented with profiles of hosts offering to rent a private room. The first study explored the effect of providing different amounts of TRI, contrasting minimal, full, and user-selected information profiles.
