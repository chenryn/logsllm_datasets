### Stress and Timing Violations

When a device is under stress, its threshold voltage (VT) increases over time. This can eventually lead to a violation of the latch setup time, resulting in the capture of an incorrect value in the latch. In the following analysis, we assume that microprocessors are designed with a 1% timing margin. This delay margin can be converted to a maximum allowable VT increase.

### Electromigration (EM) Failure Phenomenon

Electromigration (EM) is a well-known and well-studied failure mechanism that can occur in conductor lines [3,5,6]. The most vulnerable parts of conductor lines to EM are vias interconnecting different metal layers, especially those experiencing unidirectional current flow. Figure 1 illustrates a reference circuit susceptible to EM. The outputs of the pFET and nFET devices are connected through a segment of M2 metal, as shown in Figure 1(b). Consequently, the vias vup and vdown connect the M1 metal lines to M2, linking the outputs of the pFET and nFET devices.

- **Clock Transition from One to Zero:**
  - The pFET device conducts, and current flows through vup from M1 to M2 to charge the wire capacitance Cref.
  - There is minimal current through vdown because the nFET device is non-conducting.

- **Clock Transition from Zero to One:**
  - The nFET device conducts, and current flows through vdown from M2 to M1 to discharge Cref.
  - There is minimal current through vup.

As a result, vup and vdown experience an average unidirectional current of (Cref·Vdd)/t, where t is the clock period. This makes the vias vulnerable to EM effects. Based on Black’s equation [3], the FIT (Failures In Time) for EM failures in the reference circuit (vias in this case) is described by:

\[ \text{FORC}_{\text{EM}} = \frac{10^9}{A_{\text{TDDB}} Z T^{X+Y} e^{-bT_a V_{\text{dd}}}} \]

where \( A_{\text{TDDB}}, a, b, X, Y, \) and \( Z \) are fitting parameters derived empirically [2].

### Estimating the FIT of Microarchitecture Structures

#### FIT of Microarchitecture Structures due to EM

Using FORCEM, we can estimate the FIT of a multi-port register file, as shown in Figure 4. In register files, vias with unidirectional current are those between bitlines and pass transistors (nFETs gated by wordlines). Generally, bitlines are implemented on M2 or upper metal layers, requiring vias to connect pass transistors to bitlines. Since read bitlines are always precharged before cells are read, these vias (e.g., vsel) have current flow from the bitlines toward the pass transistor when reading out "1" to discharge the precharged capacitance Cbitline, but no current flows while reading "0."

- **Effective Defect Density:**
  - The effective defect density of the register file is given by the number of vias between bitlines and pass transistors over the area of the structure.
  - Each cell has one via between the bitline and pass transistor per read port, totaling \( N_{\text{cells}} \cdot N_{\text{readports}} \) vias across the register file.

- **Current Density:**
  - The current density through the vulnerable vias is given by \( \frac{C_{\text{bitline}} \cdot V_{\text{dd}}}{t} \), where \( C_{\text{bitline}} = N_{\text{entries}} \cdot C_{\text{drain}} + C_{\text{wire}} \).
  - This current flows through the vias only while reading "1," with an average duty cycle of \( P_1 \cdot \left[ \frac{N_{\text{reads}}}{N_{\text{entries}} \cdot N_{\text{readports}}} \right] \).

The combined expression for the FIT rate of register files due to EM based on FORCEM is:

\[ \text{FIT}_{\text{EM\_regfile}} = \frac{N_{\text{cells}} \cdot N_{\text{readports}} \cdot C_{\text{bitline}} \cdot P_1 \cdot \text{FORCEM}}{C_{\text{ref}} \cdot N_{\text{reads}} \cdot N_{\text{entries}} \cdot N_{\text{readports}}} \]

### Summary

- **Stress and Timing Violations:** Increased VT over time can lead to latch setup time violations.
- **EM Failure Phenomenon:** Unidirectional current through vias in conductor lines can cause EM failures.
- **FIT Estimation:** The FIT of microarchitecture structures, such as register files, can be estimated using EM models and empirical parameters.

This structured approach provides a clear and professional understanding of the issues and methods involved in analyzing and estimating the reliability of microarchitecture structures.
