Clock
failure  phenomenon 
Electromigration  (EM)  is  a  well-known  and  well-
studied 
that  can  occur  on 
conductor lines [3,5,6]. The portions of conductor lines 
most  vulnerable  to  EM  are  vias  interconnecting 
different  metal  layers  that  experience  unidirectional 
current  flow.  Figure  1  shows  an  example  reference 
circuit vulnerable to EM. The outputs of the pFET and 
nFET devices are connected through a segment of M2 
metal,  as  shown  in  Figure  1(b).  As  a  result,  vup  and 
vdown vias abut  the  M1 metal  lines to  M2,  connecting 
the outputs of the pFET and the nFET devices3. When 
the  clock  transits  from  one  to  zero,  the  pFET  device 
conducts,  and  current  flows  through vup  upward  from 
M1  to  M2  in  order to  charge the  wire  capacitance  of 
the  M2  line,  given  by  Cref.    There  is  little  current 
through  vdown  because  the  nFET  device  is  non-
conducted. Conversely, on the zero-to-one transition of 
the clock, the nFET device conducts, and current flows 
through  vdown  downward  from  M2  to  M1  in  order  to 
discharge Cref, while little current flows through vup. As 
a  result,  vup  and  vdown  are  subject  to  an  average 
unidirectional  current 4 of  (Cref·Vdd)/t,  where  t  is  the 
clock period.  This causes the vias to be vulnerable to 
EM effects. Based on Black’s equation [3], the FIT of 
our reference circuit (vias in this case) for EM failures 
is described by the following: 
3 The  length  of  the  M2  line  is  assumed  to  be  equal  to  the  typical 
length  of the  wire  segment  between two  successive  wire repeaters, 
which is 300µm in 65nm technology. 
4  Besides  occurring  in  the  reference  circuit,  current  also  flows 
unidirectionally in Vdd and GND distribution networks.

TDDB is a failure mechanism causing a conductive 
path  to  form  in  gate  oxide,  which  causes  leakage 
current through the gate [15]. There can be four types 
of  gate  oxide  breakdown,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  3: 
oxide  breakdown  at  the  pFET  source,  pFET  drain, 
nFET source, and nFET drain area. The resistive path 
between the gate and the source or drain area leads to 
current  flow  through  the  gate.    This  can  oppose  the 
current  of  the  logic  stage  that  is  driving  the  effected 
FET,  leading  to  a  slowdown  in  either  zero-to-one  or 
one-to-zero 
the  device 
vulnerable  to  timing  violations.  In  our  model,  we 
assume that for any circuit on the critical path, a single 
device failure is sufficient to lead to a timing violation. 
The MTTF of TDDB given in [2,15] is applicable to 
all  four  types  of  breakdown,  assuming  continuous 
device stress (i.e., 100% duty cycle).  Thus, the FORC

4.1. FIT of Microarchitecture Structures due to 
EM 
Using FORCEM, we are able to estimate the FIT of a 
multi-port register file, such as that shown in Figure 4. 
In register files, vias having only unidirectional current 
are  those  between  bitlines  and  pass  transistors  (i.e., 
nFETs  gated  by  wordlines).  In  general,  bitlines  are 
implemented  on  the  M2  or  upper  metal  layers,  thus 
requiring  vias  to  connect  pass  transistors  to  bitlines. 
Because  read  bitlines  are  always  precharged  prior  to 
cells being read, these vias (e.g., vsel) have current flow 
from  the  bitlines  toward  the  pass  transistor  upon 
reading  out  “1” 
the  precharged 
capacitance of the bitlines, Cbitline, but no current flows 
while  reading  “0.”  Figure  4(b)  depicts  the  current 
direction  on  the  read  bitline,  bl0_k,  when  cell  Cellik 
stores “1” and is being selected by asserting wordline 
wl0_i.  
to  discharge 
As  a  result,  the  effective  defect  density  of  the 
register  file  is  given  by  the  number  of  vias  between 
bitlines  and  pass  transistors  over  the  area  of  the 
structure. Each cell has one via between the bitline and 
pass transistor per read port, totaling Ncells·Nreadports vias 
across the register file. In order to express the FIT rate 
of  the  register  file  relative  to  that  of  the  reference 
circuit,  we  must  also  determine  the  current  density 
through  the  vulnerable  vias,  which  is  given  by 
(Cbitline·Vdd)/t, 
capacitance 
discharged through vias, where Cbitline = Nentries·Cdrain + 
Cwire.  This  current  flows  through  the  vias  only  while

registers, respectively, and P1 is the probability of the 
cell  storing  a  “1.”  Thus,  the  product  of  the  two 
previous expressions gives the effective current density 
of the vias.
