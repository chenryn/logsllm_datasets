8 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This paper presents our measurements relating to eWhoring using
data collected from underground forums. These forums serve as
a gateway into offending by curious users aimed at easy money
making methods. Packs are compiled from images and videos gath-
ered from third-party sites (see ğ4.5), mostly offering adult and
pornographic content (see ğ4.4), but also photos taken from social
networks or blogs. Some of these packs were found to contain child
abuse material. The proposed methodology is helpful to understand
what services or sites fraudsters are being abused. For example, it
could be applied by social networks to protect their users against
identity theft; or from adult industry to enforce copyright.
Many of the sites where packs are distributed from have terms
of service prohibiting content that infringes others’ copyright or
contain nudity. Indeed, we found many links where the material
was removed due to infringement of these terms. As actors rely on
these third-party sites for sharing material, a potential intervention
approach is for image sharing and cloud storage sites to rigorously
enforce their terms of service. To this end, blacklists with hashes of
known images used for eWhoring, e.g. those found in packs, could
be created and shared among stakeholders.
Actors post screenshots showing proof-of-earnings on the fo-
rums, with the intention of advertising service or goods or to brag
about their capabilities. We analysed a set of 1.8k of these images
to get an estimation of the earnings made by eWhoring. We ob-
serve actors reporting hundreds of US dollars made in a few days of
eWhoring. The total, earnings reported by 661 actors are US$511k.
Our analysis shows that Amazon and PayPal are the most used plat-
forms for obtaining payment. The average amount per transaction
is reported to be around US$40.
Here, payment platforms may be able to play a role in detecting
and shutting down accounts used to receive payments for eWhoring.
Furthermore, regulating the exchange of non-fiat currencies, such
as selling gift cards for Bitcoin, may make it more difficult for
criminals to monetise their activities [1].
Those legitimately involved in the adult entertainment industry
potentially suffer multiple harm from eWhoring. First, their images
may be stolen and used for fraud. Second, they may miss out on the
revenue that has otherwise gone to a fraudster. When delivering
interventions, there is the potential to cause further harm to those
legitimately involved on online sex work. This should be taken into
account when designing interventions, to ensure they do not have
negative impacts on those that are law-abiding.
Our measurements confirm that eWhoring is a low-value but
high-volume fraud. The legality of these activities is dubious, but
the specifics relating to the type of crime involved will vary by ju-
risdiction. Until recently, it had not attracted the attention of either
law enforcement or academia, probably because victims may not be
aware of, or do not report, the scam. However, this activity poses
various social and ethical concerns, both for offenders and victims.
We have observed that users who were initially interested in gam-
ing, coding or hacking turned into experienced eWhoring actors.
These users, probably young people according to our experience
reading these posts, get involved in online sexual conversations,
are exposed to pornography and are at risk of downloading, storing
and re-distributing illegal material. While their customers believe
they are paying for encounters with attractive women, they are
actually engaged in sexual activities with fraudsters, potentially
underage.

APPENDIX: ETHICAL ISSUES
This research involved a substantial number of ethical issues. To
address them,we used the guiding principles contained in The Menlo
Report: Ethical Principles Guiding Information and Communication
Technology Research [11] and the British Society of Criminology’s
Statement of Ethics [6]. We also complied with the Cambridge Cy-
bercrime Centre’s data sharing agreements, which sets out how
the data may be used and handled. This design was approved by
the ethics committee of the Department of Computer Science and
Technology of the University of Cambridge (#473). We next describe
in detail our approach with respect to these frameworks.
P1 Respect for Persons
Stakeholder identification. The dataset we used to conduct this
research contains the digital identifiers used by actors involved
in eWhoring forums, as well as their communications and other
relationships that can be derived from such identification. Even if
476
Measuring eWhoring
IMC ’19, October 21–23, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands
sensitive material (particularly images) is done semi-automatically,
using established methods and tools to avoid researchers’ exposure
to potentially perturbing material.
Our research design was based on the assumption that finding
indecent images of children was very unlikely. Nonetheless, we
discussed this research with the IWF in advance in order to reduce
the likelihood of prosecution, and guidelines were established in
the event that images were classified as child exploitation material,
namely immediately reporting the location of the images to the
IWF, and deleting them from our servers. These guidelines were
established as a precaution with the assistance of the REB. We
originally thought it unlikely that the dataset would contain child
abuse material, and were surprised when matches were identified.
We reiterate that these images were never viewed by any of the
researchers, and our guidelines were complied with. Given our
experience, future research in this area should assume a greater
likelihood of finding indecent images of children, and so would
need to consider whether our design is adequate.
P3 Justice
Our study complies with the principles of fairness and equity in
the selection of research subjects. We do not arbitrarily target or
exclude users based on any attribute other than an active participa-
tion in eWhoring forums. We do not know the representativeness
of that user base in terms of religion, political affiliation, sexual
orientation, health, age, technical competency, national origin, race,
or socioeconomic status, as suggested in the Menlo Report [11].
P4 Respect for Law and Public Interest
Compliance. Our prior belief was that the risk of obtaining in-
decent images of children was very low, as it is against the rules
of the forums we were looking at and we expected moderators
would remove any such content. However, as noted above, we took
precautions against this eventuality and, as discussed in (ğ4.3), we
were surprised to find that a small proportion of the images were
indecent images of children. Those were reported using appropri-
ate channels (the INHOPE hotline operator for the jurisdiction in
which the work was conducted).
Transparency and Accountability. In our reporting of this re-
search, we attempted to follow the principles of transparency and ac-
countability. This encompasses our data sources, research method-
ology and tools used (including known or identified limitations),
and the main results obtained. Our tools, data, and acquired know-
how remains at the disposal of the community for any enquiry that
requires further clarifications. No data or insights that could help
to identify users will be shared.
these identifiers are merely nicknames, this could imply a risk to
those actors. We took precautions to avoid exposing the identity
of these research subjects. In accordance with the British Society
of Criminology’s Statement of Ethics, our research analyses only
collective behaviour, rather than individuals. We were also careful
with our presentation of results to reduce the likelihood they could
be linked back to the forum accounts, potentially leaking their
identity. The dataset we were provided with8 was collected from
public sources and already contained the identifiers. The identifiers
are hard to fully remove as (variations on) the identifiers are used
in the text of posts. Hence, removing the identifiers would make
the analysis more difficult but not reduce risk to forum users as we
do not publish anything that can be linked to those identifiers.
Informed consent. Our analysis involves subjects whom it is im-
possible to obtain informed consent from, since this did not took
place at collection time when the dataset was created. This, how-
ever, fits the case discussed in The Menlo Report in which gathering
informed consent is impracticable:
‘Because of the difficulty in identifying all in-
dividuals from whom consent should be sought
or in practicably obtaining consent, researchers
or REBs may frequently conclude that seeking
a waiver of informed consent or waiver of docu-
mentation of informed consent are the only op-
tions’ [11].
We therefore resorted to a waiver of informed consent issued
by our REB. This approach also complies with the British Society
of Criminology’s Statement of Ethics [6], as the dataset is collected
from online communities where the data are publicly available,
and, as mentioned above, is used to analyse collective rather than
individual behaviour.
P2 Beneficence
Identification of Potential Benefits and Harms. Our work in-
volves societal benefits as it attempts to provide an improved un-
derstanding of a phenomenon with potential legal implications and,
by extension, an advancement of existing knowledge of the cy-
bercrime ecosystem. Furthermore, our analysis pipeline could find
application in other cybercrime areas, thus fostering and facilitating
additional research in the field. However, conducting this research
involves the analysis of images containing sexual or nude content.
The viewing of such images poses a risk to the well-being of re-
searchers. Additionally since these images come from unknown
parties engaged in cybercrime, there is a risk that there may be
indecent images of children included within the images that we
would collect. Possession of such images is a strict liability offence
in the jurisdictions where this research was conducted. Hence, the
possession of such images presents a legal risk.
Balancing Risks and Benefits. Our assessment of risks and ben-
efits concluded that there is a reasonable balance that justifies this
work if a number of design precautions were implemented to miti-
gate or minimise risks. We detail them next.
Mitigation of Realised Harms. Our analysis pipeline (ğ 4) was
purposely designed to address the risks mentioned above, thus
limiting the ethical and legal concerns. Classification and analysis of
