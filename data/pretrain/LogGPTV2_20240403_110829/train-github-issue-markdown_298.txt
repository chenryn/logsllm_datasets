by **PI:EMAIL** :
    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    @see http://play.golang.org/p/unO74If5mD
    What is the expected output?
    in the expression "a.b.c.Check()" a is not nil, but b is. 
    I expect a run time panic to occur:
    "If x is of pointer or interface type and has the value nil, assigning to,
    evaluating, or calling x.f causes a run-time panic." (spec extract)
    What do you see instead?
    the method Check() is called instead.
    Which compiler are you using?  6g
    Which operating system are you using? Linux 3.5.0-18-generic
    Which version are you using?  (run 'go version')1.0.3
