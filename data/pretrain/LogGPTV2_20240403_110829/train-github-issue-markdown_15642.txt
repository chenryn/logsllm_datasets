Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-manipulate-arrays-
with-unshift has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include
links to screenshots if possible.
Although the comment conveys the correct message as below  
`// Add "Paul" to the start of myArray`  
`// Only change code below this line.`
The description says the following :  
_Let's take the code we had last time and unshift this value **to the end** :
"Paul"_  
It should be **to the first**
