### Issue Report: FreeCodeCamp Challenge - "Manipulate Arrays with unshift"

**Challenge URL:**  
[http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-manipulate-arrays-with-unshift](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-manipulate-arrays-with-unshift)

**Issue Description:**

The challenge instructions contain an inconsistency that may confuse learners. Specifically, the description states:

> _"Let's take the code we had last time and unshift this value **to the end**: 'Paul'"_

However, the correct usage of the `unshift` method is to add an element to the **beginning** (or first position) of an array, not to the end. The comment in the code correctly indicates what needs to be done:

```javascript
// Add "Paul" to the start of myArray
// Only change code below this line.
```

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Navigate to the challenge: [http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-manipulate-arrays-with-unshift](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-manipulate-arrays-with-unshift)
2. Read the challenge description.
3. Observe the inconsistency between the description and the comment in the code.

**Expected Behavior:**

The challenge description should accurately reflect the intended use of the `unshift` method. It should state:

> _"Let's take the code we had last time and unshift this value **to the beginning**: 'Paul'"_

**Screenshots:**

- [Optional] Include a link to a screenshot of the challenge description and the code comments if possible.

**Suggested Fix:**

Update the challenge description to read:

> _"Let's take the code we had last time and unshift this value **to the beginning**: 'Paul'"_

This will ensure that the instructions are clear and consistent with the expected behavior of the `unshift` method.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
