Would love to have a better web development experience with Deno out of the
box.
  * First, the server should restart whenever I make changes.
  * Second, the website should reload whenever I make changes.
For the server, I'd like to propose a `deno watch` subcommand or `deno run
--watch` flag that automatically restarts the server in a controlled way, e.g.
    deno watch *.ts --run main.ts --allow-net
    # or
    deno run --watch *.ts --allow-net main.ts
If we also had a `Deno.watch` API for watching directories or files, we could
then implement a simple client refresh via server-sent events (example) or web
sockets.
EDIT: It would be nice if the `watch` subcommand/flag would be able to notify
the running code that it will/should be restarted - maybe something via
signals (e.g. `SIGUSR1`), command line flags, some API, or a similar mechanism
- so that the server could notify the client that it will be restarted and
that the client needs to be reloaded.
