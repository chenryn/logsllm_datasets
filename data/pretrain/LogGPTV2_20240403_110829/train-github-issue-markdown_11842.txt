## 📝 Provide a description of the new feature
I do like when there is a few icons in my traybar but they are informative for
me. Unfortunately, PT isn't in this list. So I would like to have an ability
to hide icon like in most applications like NVIDIA Control Panel, PhysX, etc.
Would it be possible?
Thanks in advance!
