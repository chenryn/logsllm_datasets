## The Loss of Locational Privacy While Traveling in Your Automobile

### Surveillance Technologies
- **Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPRs)**
- **Snitch Devices in Your Car**
  - Transponder-based Electronic Toll Collection (ETC)
  - GPS
  - Smartphones with traffic apps
  - Dumb phones
  - Automatic tire pressure monitors

### Do You Have the Right to Travel?
- **Interstate**: Yes. *Saenz v. Roe (1999)* established the right to travel, guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
- **Intrastate**: Yes, but less clear. It is usually derived from First Amendment freedom of association and Fifth Amendment due process protection.
- **International**: Yes. *Kent v. Dulles (1958)* affirmed that the right to travel is part of the "liberty" protected by the Fifth Amendment.

### Do You Have the Right to Drive?
- **No**. Driving is a privilege, not a right, regulated by state laws. It must be licensed and can be revoked.

### Do You Have the Right to Anonymous Travel?
- **Mostly Yes**, but it depends on your mode of travel:
  - **Driving**: No, as it requires a license.
  - **Commercial Flights**: No, as it requires identification.
  - **Crossing National Borders**: No, as it requires identification.

### Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPRs)
- **Functionality**: ALPRs use cameras, computers, and GPS to read license plates (OCR), note coordinates and time, and can be mobile or fixed.
- **Capacity**: Can process about 3,000 plates per hour at speeds up to 130 MPH.
- **Data Storage**: All data is saved and downloaded to a central repository.

### Legal Implications
- **Hester v. United States (1924)**: Observations without physical intrusion do not implicate the Fourth Amendment.
- **United States v. Martin (1986)**: Police can look into parked car windows if lawfully present.
- **No reasonable expectation of privacy for license plates in public**.
- **United States v. Jones (2012)**: A warrant is needed to place a tracking device, not for the act of tracking itself.
- **Kyllo v. United States (2001)**: Infrared technology cannot be used to look inside constitutionally protected areas.
- **Florida v. Riley (1989)**: Aerial surveillance is permissible.
- **United States v. Lee (1927)**: Artificial illumination can aid observations.

### Data Retention and Discovery
- **New Hampshire**: General ban on data retention.
- **Maine**: 21-day maximum for non-criminal investigations.
- **New Jersey**: Must retain data for 5 years, then destroy it.
- **New York City**: Data retained for 5 years.
- **Public Access**: Varies; Minneapolis released then recanted data.
- **Legal Discovery**: New York's Rosario material does not include ALPR data, so it is not subject to discovery.

### Commercial Market for ALPR Data
- **Vigilant Solutions**: Collects over 35 million reads/month, primarily for law enforcement.
- **Tow Operators**: Scan and sell data, looking for repossession hits.

### Building a License Plate Reader Detector
- **Infrared LEDs**: Used to illuminate the plate.
- **IR Photodiodes**: Detect the pulsating IR light.
- **Challenges**: Standard IR photodiodes may not work; ELSAG units use 735nm LEDs.

### What to Do?
- **Creative Solutions**: Steve Jobs never had plates.
- **Law Enforcement Tactics**: No front plate, masking back plate, driving with the tailgate down, tinted windows.
- **Temporary Tags**: Vary by state; some states do not honor out-of-state temp tags.
- **Non-Reflective Plates**: Harder for ALPRs to read.
- **Stacked Characters and Low Contrast**: Make plates more difficult to read.

### Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) Tags
- **Always On**: 915MHz RFID, multiple non-compatible protocols.
- **Detection Circuit**: Can detect when the tag is being read.
- **Bagging the Tag**: Only bring it out when paying a toll.

### Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS)
- **TPMS**: 315MHz transmitter with a unique ID.
- **RFID in Tires**: Unique per tire, varies by manufacturer.
- **Solutions**: EMP or locally jam 315MHz in the wheel well.

### Other RFIDs
- **Parking Passes**: Usually private, but some municipalities use them.
- **Bagging RFIDs**: If not in use, bag them to prevent tracking.

### INRIX
- **Data Collection**: From 100 million devices across 1.8 million miles of road.
- **Usage**: Google Maps, built-in navigation systems, and top navigation apps.
- **Dumb Phones**: Share location data through cell towers.

### Conclusion
- **Salt the Plate**: Make it harder for ALPRs to read.
- **Bag the Tag**: Only use ETC tags when necessary.
- **Zap and Jam the Tires**: Disable TPMS and RFID.
- **Turn Them Off**: Ensure all unnecessary tracking devices are disabled.
