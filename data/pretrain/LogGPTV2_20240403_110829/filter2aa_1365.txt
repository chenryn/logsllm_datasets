THE LOSS OF LOCATIONAL PRIVACY 
WHILE TRAVELING IN YOUR 
AUTOMOBILE 
– Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPRs) 
– Snitch devices in your car  
• Transponder based Electronic Toll Collection 
(ETC) 
• GPS 
• Smart phones traffic apps 
• Dumb phones 
• Automatic tire pressure monitors 
DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL? 
Interstate: YES.   Saenz v. Roe (1999) the right to 
travel that is guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  
Intrastate: YES.   But not as clear, it's usually derived 
from First Amendment freedom of association and Fifth 
Amendment due process protection. 
International: YES.  Kent v. Dulles (1958) The right 
to travel is a part of the "liberty" of which a citizen cannot 
be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth 
Amendment.  
DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DRIVE? 
                                NO 
It is a privilege, not a right, that is regulated, 
must be granted (licensed) and can be 
revoked, according to the prevailing laws of 
every jurisdiction of the United States.      
DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
ANONYMOUS TRAVEL? 
Mostly YES but it depends on your mode of 
travel, in the U.S. you are not required to 
carry ID except: 
• when driving, it requires licensing       NO 
• taking a commercial flight                      NO 
• crossing a national border                      NO 
AUTOMATIC LICENSE PLATE READERS 
A system of cameras, computers and GPS that 
reads the license plates (OCR), and notes 
coordinates and time, they can be mobile or 
fixed locations. 
Can do about 3,000 plates/hour, on moving 
vehicles up to 130MPH. 
All data is saved and downloaded to a central 
repository. 
SOME ALPRS 
Some ALPRs 
                                 NOT ALPRs 
                                    (nor red light cam) 
NOT ALPRs 
(red light cam) 
WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL? 
  Police have been “running” plates forever 
• Captures all plates in its field of vision 
• retained in databases along with pictures 
from 21 days to 5 years (depends on 
jurisdiction) 
• Enough APLRs and data points = tracked       
NYC: 108 fixed and 130 mobile APLRs as of 
2009 
• Impossible to opt-out 
IS IT LEGAL TO DO THIS 
WARRENTLESS TRACKING? 
                                         YES 
• Hester v. United States (1924) An observation made by a 
police officer without a physical intrusion into a constitutionally 
protected area does not implicate the Fourth Amendment nor 
require a search warrant. 
• United States v. Martin (1986) A police officer who is 
lawfully present in an area may look into the windows of a parked 
car. 
• No reasonable expectation of privacy on your 
license plate in public 
• Police do not need a warrant to "run" your plate 
WAIT A MINUTE THE SUPREME 
COURT RULED A WARRENT IS NEEDED 
FOR GPS TRACKING 
                YES BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT 
United States v. Jones (2012)  what the court 
said is that a warrant is needed to place the 
tracking device on the vehicle, not the act of 
tracking it. 
I THOUGHT THE POLICE CANNOT USE 
ADVANCED SPY TECHNOLOGY 
WITHOUT A WARRENT 
              YES AND NO 
• Kyllo v. United States (2001) infrared cannot be 
used to look inside a constitutionally protected area 
• Florida v. Riley (1989) aerial surveillance can be used 
• United States v. Lee (1927) artificial illumination 
can be used to aid observations 
• binoculars can be used (no Supreme Court case but 
Scalia has said it is OK) 
FEMA AS BEEN FUNDING LOCAL PDS 
100% OF THE COST OF ALPRs 
ALPR DATA RETENTION 
• NH: general ban 
• ME: 21 day maximum for non-hit non-criminal 
investigations 
• NJ: must retain for a full 5 years, and then must 
destroy after 5 years 
• NYC: retained for 5 years. Even though general 
surveillance video is deleted after 21 days if no 
active investigation 
IS THE DATA PUBLIC OR OPEN TO 
LEGAL DISCOVERY? 
• Public? Maybe. Minneapolis released then 
recanted. GPS coordinates for their fixed readers 
was redacted. 
• Discovery? NY has what is known as Rosario 
material, “Any written or recorded 
statement…made by such witness…which relates 
to the subject matter of the witness’s testimony.” 
However NY claims that ALPR data is not a 
"statement" so therefore it is not Rosario, and 
not subject to discovery. 
ACTUAL LPR DATA (MOBILE UNIT) 
ACTUAL LPR DATA (FIXED REDACTED, THEN 
MOBILE) 
 IT MAY NOT MATTER WHAT 
RETENTION LAWS ARE, AS THERE IS A 
COMMERCIAL MARKET 
• Vigilant Solutions. it’s only customers are Law 
Enforcement. Its in 28 Metro areas, >35 million 
reads/month, collected by non-law enforcement 
scout cars 
• Tow operators driving and scanning 
everything, looking for repo hits, but then 
sell the data. 
• Law Enforcement will just purchase the data 
BUILD A LICENCE PLATE READER 
DETECTOR 
• It uses infrared LEDs to illuminate the plate 
• Its always on, and it is always pulsating to try 
to get the best exposure 
• So we should be able to detect, by just using 
IR photodiodes right? 
• Had a few failures to work 
• Standard IR is 850nm. ELSAGs unit uses 
735nm LEDS which near-IR (or far-red) 
720nm IR PASS 
730±30nm BANDPASS 
WHY STANDARD IR PHOTODIODES WON’T WORK 
Working basic ELSAG Circuit 
It eventually 
turned into 
this. The 
monkey 
screams 
When it 
detects 
an ALPR 
WHAT TO DO? 
Well Steve Jobs never had plates

MAYBE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN HELP 
Drive with the tail gate down? 
Yep seems to be a thing, different day 
WHAT DO COPS DO? 
• No front plate, even if required 
• Heavily mask the back plate with dark plastic 
or alternating Fresnel lenses 
• Drive with the tail gate down 
• Also tint you windows and windshield…. 
• You CANNOT do any of this legally 
• Don’t want any extra interaction with law 
enforcement 
TEMP TAGS 
TEMP TAGS 
•                                             
BE WARNED THAT NY 
TEMP TAGS ARE NOT 
HONORED IN MA, CAR 
WILL BE IMPOUNDED 
WHAT ARE THESE? 
No number 
VIN and  
Expiration date 
How de we get 
them? 
• CA you can drive a new car with no tags for 
90 days (was 6 months while Jobs was alive) 
and cannot drive outside of CA 
• Most temp tags are only good 20 to 90 days 
• Registering you vehicle to a company hides 
you in a thin veil, but still plates are recorded 
• But do NOT get commercial tags 
PERILS OF COMMERCIAL PLATES 
WHAT IS HARDEST FOR ALPR 
• Non reflective plates 
– Crime to remove reflectivity in CA 
– Failed inspection in MA if you plate looses relectivity 
• Low contrast plates 
• Light red characters 
• With 3 or more stacked letters  
• Registration stickers that need to be placed close to 
the letters 
• 8 digit plates, smaller and narrower letters 
• Also no front plate, means half the chance of being 
read

ELECTRONIC TOLL COLLECTION TAGS 
• Always on 
• All ETC is 915Mhz in the US  
• Multiple non-compatible protocols 
– Interagency Group (IAG) (E-Zpass) 
– California Title 21 
– Allegro 
– eGo 
• It’s RFID, some with battery asssit some without 
E-ZPASS TAG 
• 3.6V low draw, 
long life (10 year) 
battery 
• Device draws 8uA 
quiescent 
• Device draws 
0.3mA when 
being read, 
transmitting 
• DO NOT DO THIS, 
IT IS NOT YOUR 
PROPERTY 
E-Z PASS READ DETECTION CIRCUIT 
Low  side (shunt R1 between circuit and ground) 
E-ZPASS GETS READ UNDER THE SIGN, BUT NO 
TOLL AROUND HERE 
SO THAT’S 
WHY! 
NOT SO HIDDEN, BUT NO TOLL HERE 
E-ZPASS GETS READ AT 42nd & 8th  
TransCore 
Company can read 
all transportation 
formats, like  ATA, 
eGo, IAG (reversed 
engineered), etc. 
PROBLEM WITH TAG BASED DETECTOR IS 
YOU MUST BE READ TO FIND THEM 
NEED A BETTER ONE 
42nd & 8th WITH NEW DETECTOR 
• NYSDOT admits they use it for "travel time" 
signs 
• Who else gets and what happens to this data? 
• How long is it retained? 
WHAT TO DO? 
• Bag the tag, and only bring it out when you 
want to pay a toll. 
• If you have a sticker build a faraday cage box 
that you can swing open and shut  
• Remember the toll is tracking you too 
• It will become obvious to “watchers” you are 
doing this as you will be seen at tolls but no 
where else 
YOUR TIRES 
• Federal US TREAD (Transportation Recall 
Enhancement, Accountability and 
Documentation) law 
• Two different things happing here 
– Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) 315MHz 
transmitter at the valve stem, not the tire, this is part 
of the rim. Has a battery and a unique ID 
– RFID in the tires themselves, unique per tire 
• Michelin uses 915MHz 
• Goodyear uses 125kHz 
• Auto manufactures place the VIN in these RFIDs as 
well 
  Creative Commons image wikipedia.org User:BMK Germany (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sicherheitsreifen_BMK.jp) 
WHAT TO DO? 
• Look for RFIDs and EMP them 
• Locally jam 315MHz in the wheel well 
OTHER RFID 
• Parking passes, it might be an hang tag or a 
sticker you had to put on the glass 
• Usually private, but found one municipally 
that put them in for residents to cut down on 
parking permit counterfeiting. It’s 915Mhz 
too. 
• Need to bag them too, if not in use, but a 
permit for public on street parking is a 
problem 
INRIX 
• collects position data from 100 million devices 
across 1.8 million miles of road 
• Google maps uses them for traffic 
• 6 of the 8 auto companies with built-in 
navigations systems (like Ford, BMW and Audi) 
• 8 of the 12 top navigation apps in Apple’s App 
Store (like MapQuest, Garmin, Microsoft and 
Telenav) 
• dumb phones, without GPS and internet 
connections are sharing location data with them 
through cell towers 
• Commercial truck fleets 
CONCLUSION 
• Salt the plate 
• Bag the tag 
• Zap and jam the tires 
• Turn ‘em off
