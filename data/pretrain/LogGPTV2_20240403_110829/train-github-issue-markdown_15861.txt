# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.900] (and Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19041.329])
    PowerToys version: v0.19.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FanzcyZones
# Steps to reproduce
Set up for only zone zone with no border.  
Open Notepad.exe  
Move Notepad to the one zone  
See that Notepad covers the whole non-taskbar desktop area  
Move the taskbar to a different edge of the screen  
Move Notepad to the one zone again  
See that the zone uses its original dimensions, not refactored for the new
non-taskbar desktop area
# Expected behavior
See that Notepad covers the new whole non-taskbar desktop area  
(On move of the taskbar, have the zone area recalculated)
# Actual behavior
See that the zone uses its original dimensions, not refactored for the new
non-taskbar desktop area. This can even be observed when the zone previews are
showing before depositing the window in the zone.
