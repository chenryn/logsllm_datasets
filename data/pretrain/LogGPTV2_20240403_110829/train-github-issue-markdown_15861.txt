# Environment
- **Windows Build Numbers:**
  - Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.900]
  - Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19041.329]
- **PowerToys Version:** v0.19.1
- **PowerToy Module:** FancyZones

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Set up a single zone with no borders.
2. Open Notepad.exe.
3. Move Notepad to the single zone.
4. Observe that Notepad covers the entire non-taskbar desktop area.
5. Move the taskbar to a different edge of the screen.
6. Move Notepad back to the single zone.
7. Observe that the zone retains its original dimensions and does not adjust for the new non-taskbar desktop area.

# Expected Behavior
- When the taskbar is moved, the zone should automatically recalculate its dimensions to cover the new non-taskbar desktop area.
- Notepad should cover the entire new non-taskbar desktop area after the taskbar is moved.

# Actual Behavior
- The zone retains its original dimensions and does not adjust for the new non-taskbar desktop area.
- This issue can be observed even when the zone previews are showing before placing the window in the zone.
