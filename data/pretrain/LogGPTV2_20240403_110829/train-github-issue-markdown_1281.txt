At first I thought this was a problem with the theme Solarized Dark, but it
appears to be the same problem with most themes (not "Dark" or "Light").
The problem (albeit a small problem) is that when I for example paste several
lines in a row, the background color at the line-numbers changes after some
lines, as seen on line 1239 on the screenshot. The amount of lines needed to
create show this fault differs.

OS X 10.11 (15A284)  
VsCode: v0.10.3
Reproduce:
  1. Open any file with code
  2. Select all
  3. Copy
  4. Spam paste until it occurs (anywhere from 50-1500 lines in my experience)
Is it possible that the problem has to do with transparent colors?
