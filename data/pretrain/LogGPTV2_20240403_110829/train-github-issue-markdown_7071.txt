After seeing this:
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/renderers/WebGLRenderer.js#L1991-L2061
I propose adding some kind of documentation to let the world know that there
is magic happening under the hood.
> Texture classes have a transform property. Materials can use multiple
> textures, but also have a single transform property.  
>  Because a single material, with a single transform property can have many
> textures with many unique transform properties - Three.js does voodoo magic
> under the hood to chose which texture's transform to honor.  
>  This is the list ~~[insert list]~~.
## edit
  1. map
  2. specularMap
  3. displacementMap
  4. normalMap
  5. bumpMap
  6. roughnessMap
  7. metalnessMap
  8. alphaMap
  9. emissiveMap
Maybe warn the user that if they have some kind of transform on the emissive
map, it will be completely ignored, and the user can expect to see the
transform belonging to **any** other 8 map slots that come before?
