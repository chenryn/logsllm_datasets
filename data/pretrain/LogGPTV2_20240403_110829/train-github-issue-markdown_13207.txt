I am getting traffic from a web scanner who is sending crafted payloads to my
form handlers. In particular, I'm getting arrays being sent to fields with
email and regex validators, and my logs are being filled up with  
`UnexpectedTypeException: “Expected argument of type “string”, “array” given”`
Instead of throwing a type exception, the validators should gracefully return
a violation
