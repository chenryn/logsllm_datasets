of only the integers in this interval). In this setting, each
entry of ag

bution that has statistical distance at most 3/4 from the
uniform distibution on [−p/2, p/2]. (When |a| is larger still,
the distibution gets even closer to uniform. For example,
for |a| = Θ(p) the distance from uniform is O(1/r).) The
quantization to integers of course changes the distribution,
but does not change substantially the probability that the

the point xi the polynomial F induces coeﬃcients (cid:6)fi such
that (cid:6)si − (cid:6)fi belongs to the vector space spanned by (cid:6)g and
(cid:6)h. Let F, F
be two polynomials satisfying these constraints,
and consider their diﬀerence polynomial D = F − F
. This
polynomial D satisﬁes the following three conditions: (i) D
(cid:3)
is a bivariate degree-t polynomial (since F and F
are); (ii)
D is symmetric (since F and F
are); (iii) For every i, if we
let (cid:6)di denote the coeﬃcients of the univariate polynomial
D(xi,·), then all the (cid:6)di’s belong to the vector space spanned
by (cid:6)g and (cid:6)h.

We now show that there are exactly three degrees of free-
dom in choosing a polynomial D with these properties. De-
note the matrix of coeﬃcients of D by [D], and denote by [d]
the matrix whose ith row is the vector (cid:6)di for i = 0, 1, . . . , t.
Then [d] = V · [D], where V is a Vandermonde matrix:

The conditions on the polynomial D translate to the condi-
tions that [D] is a (t + 1) × (t + 1) symmetric matrix, and
that the rows of [d] are in the vector space spanned by (cid:6)g and
(cid:6)h. The last condition can be expressed in matrix notation
by saying that there exists a (t + 1) × 2 matrix X such that

A.2 Solving for the α’s and β’s
Here we explain why the linear system of equations de-
scribed in Section 2.8 is under-deﬁned, and why the vector
space of solutions has dimension 3.
Every solution to our system of linear equations must cor-
respond to a bivariate degree-t polynomial F (due the the
inclusion of Eq. (1)) which is symmetric (due to the equa-
tions from Eq. (4)). Moreover, for each node associated with
where (cid:6)gT and (cid:6)hT (the transpose of (cid:6)g and (cid:6)h, respectively) are
column vectors. This ensures that [D] is a (t + 1) × (t + 1)
symmetric matrix, and moreover

as needed. Since there are three degrees of freedom in choos-
ing a symmetric 2×2 symmetric matrix, we get exactly three
degrees of freedom for D.
We observe that if we had the additional noise in the free
term (as in Section 2.10), then the noise space would be
spanned by the three vectors (cid:6)g, (cid:6)h, and (cid:6)e1 = (cid:9)1, 0, . . . , 0(cid:10). In
this case, we can use the exact same argument, except that
the matrix R is a symmetric 3× 3 matrix and so we have six
degrees of freedom in choosing it. (However, the lower-right
t× t sub-matrix of D is still rank-2, so once we eliminate the
dependence on the free terms we can get back to a system
with only three degrees of freedom.)
