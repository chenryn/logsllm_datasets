Question: Alice and Bob are communicating over a TCP connection. Three adversaries, Eve (Off-path), Mallory (On-path), and Trudy (In-path), are attempting to disrupt or hijack their communication. Which of the following statements accurately describe the attacks that each adversary is capable of executing?
"A": "Eve can inject a malicious TCP packet by knowing the client IP, client port, server IP, server port, and correctly guessing the sequence number.",
"B": "Mallory can observe the sequence numbers and inject messages without needing to guess any values, but must race Alice's packets.",
"C": "Trudy can modify and block messages, ensuring that her injected packets are received without needing to outpace any legitimate packets.",
"D": "Mallory can easily inject packets without racing if she knows the client IP and server IP, even without knowing the sequence numbers."
Answer: ABC
