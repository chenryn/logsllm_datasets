**ATT&CK ID:** T1205.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Port Knocking

Adversaries may employ port knocking to conceal open ports used for persistence or command and control (C2) activities. In this technique, an adversary initiates a series of connection attempts to a predefined sequence of closed ports on the target system. Upon completion of the correct sequence, a previously closed port is opened, typically by the host-based firewall. However, custom software can also be used to implement this functionality. This method allows adversaries to maintain a low profile and evade detection by standard network monitoring tools.
