User: I want to get the list of programs that shows in the Applications tab of Windows Task Manager(include the application icon and its name)  , I wonder which Windows APIs should I use ?
If I want to do the same thing on Ubuntu ,then which Ubuntu APIs should I use ?
Assistant: Afaik Qt itself will not allow you to do this, at least it did not in prior versions. To solve this for windows you will have to use win-api EnumProcesses while in linux you could use the /proc filesystem, which holds information about running processes
