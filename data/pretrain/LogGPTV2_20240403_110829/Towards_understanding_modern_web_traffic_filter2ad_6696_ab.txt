# Network Address Translation (NAT) Usage and Web Traffic Analysis

## NAT Usage
Figure 2 illustrates the usage of Network Address Translation (NAT) by presenting the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the number of different user agents per client IP address. The data shows that most (83-94%) client IPs have only one user agent, with a slight increase over time. This trend can be attributed to the growing number of computers per household, reflecting the scarcity of IPv4 addresses. The maximum number of user agents per IP observed was 69 in the United States, 500 in China, and 36 in Brazil. Our estimated percentage of NATs with two or more distinct hosts (6-17%) is lower than other studies, possibly due to methodological differences or because only some hosts behind a NAT use the CoDeeN system.

## Users and Content
Our large-scale dataset, spanning several years, is significantly larger and more comprehensive than those used in previous web traffic research. While some self-selection is inevitable, our user population is diverse, including individuals seeking faster web access, unfiltered content, better routing, enhanced privacy, and other benefits.

To ensure representativeness, we analyzed the User-Agent field in the access logs and found that global trends and regional variations in browser and operating system usage are consistent with other studies. Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) account for over 86% of browsers used over five years across four countries, and more than 83% of users' operating systems are Windows. In some countries, Firefox has a slightly higher share, which we attribute to the popularity of Firefox web proxy add-ons that can use CoDeeN. We also observe a decreasing share of MSIE, except in China, where MSIE and Windows continue to dominate.

We further investigated the content browsed by CoDeeN users by examining the top sites based on the number of requests. Globally popular websites such as Google, YouTube, Yahoo, and Facebook rank high in all four countries. Additionally, locally popular sites, such as craigslist.org, go.com, and espn.com in the United States, baidu.com, qq.com, and sina.com.cn in China, lequipe.fr, free.fr, and over-blog.com in France, and globo.com, uol.com.br, and orkut.com in Brazil, also feature prominently.

## High-Level Characteristics
### Connection Speed
We estimate client bandwidth by observing the download time for objects larger than 1 MB. Figure 1 shows CDFs of average client bandwidth per aggregated /24 IP address, indicating a consistent increase in client bandwidth over time, despite no significant changes in PlanetLab's connectivity. Geographically, the United States and France have faster speeds compared to Brazil and China. In 2006, no clients in Brazil and China had download speeds exceeding 2 Mbps, and many slow clients (less than 256 Kbps) still exist, even in developed countries.

### Maximum Concurrent Connections
Figure 3 presents CDFs of the maximum number of concurrent connections per user agent, showing a significant increase in 2010. The median number of connections grew from 4-5 in 2006 and 2008 to 6-7 in 2010. This increase is primarily due to browsers changing the default number of maximum simultaneous connections per server from 4 to 6, starting in 2008, to accommodate Ajax, which requires many simultaneous connections to reduce latency.

### Content Type Distribution
Figure 4 illustrates the shift from static image-oriented web pages to dynamic rich media web pages. The content type distribution from 2006 to 2010 shows a sharp increase in JavaScript, CSS, and XML, driven by the popular use of Ajax. Flash video (FLV) traffic also increased, taking about 25% of total traffic in the United States and Brazil in 2010. Despite the growth of embedded images in web pages, there is no corresponding surge in their numbers, likely due to improved caching behavior of many websites.

### Object Size
The size of JavaScript and CSS has been increasing steadily over time. For example, Figure 5 (a) and (b) show CDFs of JavaScript sizes in France and CSS sizes in China, respectively, from 2006 to 2010. Video object sizes, particularly FLV, are generally larger than other video formats. Figure 5 (c) compares the object size (CDF) of different video types in the United States for 2010, showing that FLV, WMV, and MPEG have median sizes of 1743 KB, 265 KB, and 802 KB, respectively.

### Traffic Share of Websites
Figure 6 examines the traffic share of video sites and advertising networks. Advertising network traffic takes 1-12% of total requests and consistently increases over time. Video site traffic also increases, reaching up to 28% in Brazil in 2010. A single top site, typically a search engine or analytics site, reaches a growing fraction of all users, up to 65% in Brazil in 2010, raising implications for user tracking and privacy.

## Page-Level Characteristics
### Previous Page Detection Algorithms
Previous approaches for detecting page boundaries include time-based and type-based methods. Time-based methods use idle time between requests, while type-based methods rely on the content type of the object. However, these approaches do not work well with modern web traffic due to the complex and dynamic nature of current web interactions.

### StreamStructure Algorithm
To address these limitations, we developed the StreamStructure algorithm, which groups requests into independent streams using the Referer field, detects main objects, and identifies initial pages. This approach is better suited for modern web traffic analysis and provides more accurate results.

By leveraging these insights and methodologies, we aim to provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of web traffic characteristics and user behavior.
