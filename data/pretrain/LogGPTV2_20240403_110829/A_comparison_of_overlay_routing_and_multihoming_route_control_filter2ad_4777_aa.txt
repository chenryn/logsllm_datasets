ABSTRACT
The limitations of BGP routing in the Internet are often blamed for
poor end-to-end performance and prolonged connectivity interrup-
tions. Recent work advocates using overlays to effectively bypass
BGP’s path selection in order to improve performance and fault
tolerance. In this paper, we explore the possibility that intelligent
control of BGP routes, coupled with ISP multihoming, can provide
competitive end-to-end performance and reliability. Using exten-
sive measurements of paths between nodes in a large content distri-
bution network, we compare the relative beneﬁts of overlay routing
and multihoming route control in terms of round-trip latency, TCP
connection throughput, and path availability. We observe that the
performance achieved by route control together with multihoming
to three ISPs (3-multihoming), is within 5-15% of overlay rout-
ing employed in conjunction 3-multihoming, in terms of both end-
to-end RTT and throughput. We also show that while multihom-
ing cannot offer the nearly perfect resilience of overlays, it can
eliminate almost all failures experienced by a singly-homed end-
network. Our results demonstrate that, by leveraging the capabil-
ity of multihoming route control, it is not necessary to circumvent
BGP routing to extract good wide-area performance and availabil-
ity from the existing routing system.

INTRODUCTION
The limitations of conventional Internet routing based on the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) are often held responsible for fail-
ures and poor performance of end-to-end transfers. A number of
studies have shown that the underlying connectivity of the Internet
is capable of providing much greater performance and resilience
than end-points currently receive. Such studies, exempliﬁed by
Detour [25, 26] and RON [6], demonstrate that using overlay rout-
ing to bypass BGP’s policy-driven routing enables quicker reaction
to failures and improved end-to-end performance.
In this paper,
we question whether overlay routing is required to make the most
of the underlying connectivity, or whether better selection of BGP
routes at an end-point is sufﬁcient.
There are two key factors contributing to the differences between
overlay routing and BGP-based routing that have not been carefully
evaluated in past work: the number of routing choices available to
each system and the policies used to select among these routes.
Route Availability. By allowing sources to specify a set of inter-
mediate hops, overlay routing allows end-points nearly arbitrary
control over the wide-area path that packets take. On the other
hand, BGP only allows a network to announce routes that it ac-
tually uses. Thus, to reach a given destination, an end-point has
access to only a single path from each Internet Service Provider
(ISP) to which it is attached [30]. As a result, an end-point’s ability
to control routing is tightly linked to the number of ISP connections
it has.
Past studies showing the relative beneﬁts of overlay routing draw
conclusions based on the highly restrictive case wherein paths from
just a single ISP are available [6, 25]. In contrast, in this paper,
we carefully consider the degree of ISP multihoming at the end-
point, and whether it provides sufﬁcient (BGP) route choices for
the end-point to obtain the same performance as when employing
an overlay network.
Route Selection. In addition to having a greater selection of routes
to choose from than BGP, overlay routing systems use much more
sophisticated policies in choosing the route for any particular trans-
fer. Overlays choose routes that optimize end-to-end performance
metrics, such as latency. On the other hand, BGP employs much
simpler heuristics to select routes, such as minimizing AS hop count
or cost. However, this route selection policy is not intrinsic to
BGP-based routing – given an adequate selection of BGP routes,
end-points can choose the one that results in the best performance,
availability, or cost. Several commercial vendors already enable
such route control or selection (e.g., [19, 21, 24]).
In this paper, we compare overlays with end-point based mech-
anisms that use this form of “intelligent” route control of the BGP
paths provided by their ISPs. Hereafter, we refer to this as multi-
homing route control or simply, route control. Notice that we do
Session 3: Multihoming and Overlaysnot assume any changes or improvements to the underlying BGP
protocol. Multihoming route control simply allows a multihomed
end-network to intelligently schedule its transfers over multiple ISP
links in order to optimize performance, availability, cost or a com-
bination of these metrics.
Our goal is to answer the question: How much beneﬁt does over-
lay routing provide over BGP, when multihoming and route con-
trol are considered? If the beneﬁt is small, then BGP path selec-
tion is not as inferior as it is held to be, and good end-to-end per-
formance and reliability are achievable even when operating com-
pletely within standard Internet routing. On the other hand, if over-
lays yield signiﬁcantly better performance and reliability character-
istics, we have further conﬁrmation of the claim that BGP is fun-
damentally limited. Then, it is crucial to develop alternate bypass
architectures such as overlay routing.
Using extensive active downloads and traceroutes between 68
servers belonging to a large content distribution network (CDN),
we compare multihoming route control and overlay routing in terms
of three key metrics: round-trip delay, throughput, and availabil-
ity. Our results suggest that when route control is employed along
with multihoming, it can offer performance similar to overlays in
terms of round-trip delay and throughput. On average, the round-
trip times achieved by the best BGP paths (selected by an ideal
route control mechanism using 3 ISPs) are within 5–15% of the
best overlay paths (selected by an ideal overlay routing scheme
also multihomed to 3 ISPs). Similarly, the throughput on the best
overlay paths is only 1–10% better than the best BGP paths. We
also show that the marginal difference in the RTT performance can
be attributed mainly to overlay routing’s ability to select shorter
paths, and that this difference can be reduced further if ISPs im-
plement cooperative peering policies. In comparing the end-to-end
path availability provided by either approach, we show that multi-
homing route control, like overlay routing, is able to signiﬁcantly
improve the availability of end-to-end paths.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe
past work that demonstrates limitations in the current routing sys-
tem, including work on overlay routing and ISP multihoming. Sec-
tion 3 provides an overview of our approach. Section 4 gives de-
tails of our measurement testbed. In Section 5, we analyze the RTT
and throughput performance differences between route control and
overlay routing and consider some possible reasons for the differ-
ences. In Section 6, we contrast the end-to-end availability offered
by the two schemes. Section 7 discusses the implications of our
results and presents some limitations of our approach. Finally, Sec-
tion 8 summarizes the contributions of the paper.
2. RELATED WORK
Past studies have identiﬁed and analyzed several shortcomings
in the design and operation of BGP, including route convergence
behavior [16, 17] and “inﬂation” of end-to-end paths due to BGP
policies [28, 32]. Particularly relevant to our study are proposals
for overlay systems to bypass BGP routing to improve performance
and fault tolerance, such as Detour [25] and RON [6].
In the Detour work, Savage et al. [25] study the inefﬁciencies
of wide-area routing on end-to-end performance in terms of round-
trip time, loss rate, and throughput. Using observations drawn from
active measurements between public traceroute server nodes, they
compare the performance on default Internet (BGP) paths with the
potential performance from using alternate paths. This work shows
that for a large fraction of default paths measured, there are alter-
nate indirect paths offering much better performance.
Andersen et al. propose Resilient Overlay Networks (RONs) to
address the problems with BGP’s fault recovery times, which have
been shown to be on order of tens of minutes in some cases [6].
RON nodes regularly monitor the quality and availability of paths
to each other, and use this information to dynamically select di-
rect or indirect end-to-end paths. RON mechanisms are shown to
signiﬁcantly improve the availability and performance of end-to-
end paths between the overlay nodes. The premise of the Detour
and RON studies is that BGP-based route selection is fundamen-
tally limited in its ability to improve performance and react quickly
to path failures. Both Detour and RON compare the performance
and resilience of overlay paths against default paths via a single
provider. Overlays offer a greater choice of end-to-end routes, as
well as greater ﬂexibility in controlling the route selection. In con-
trast, we explore the effectiveness of empowering BGP-based route
selection with intelligent route control at multihomed end-networks
in improving end-to-end availability and performance relative to
overlay routing.
Also, several past studies have focused on “performance-aware”
routing, albeit not from an end-to-end perspective. Proposals have
been made for load sensitive routing within ISPs (see [27], for ex-
ample) and, intra- and inter-domain trafﬁc engineering [10, 23, 15].
However, the focus of these studies is on balancing the utilization
on ISP links and not necessarily on end-to-end performance. More
directly related to our work is a recent study on the potential of
multihoming route control to improve end-to-end performance and
resilience, relative to using paths through a single ISP [3]. Finally,
a number of vendors have recently developed intelligent routing
appliances that monitor availability and performance over multi-
ple ISP links, and automatically switch trafﬁc to the best provider.
These products facilitate very ﬁne-grained selection of end-to-end
multihoming routes (e.g., [8, 19, 21, 24]).
3. COMPARING BGP PATHS WITH
OVERLAY ROUTING
Our objective is to understand whether the modest ﬂexibility of
multihoming, coupled with route control, is able to offer end-to-end
performance and resilience similar to overlay routing. In order to
answer this question, we evaluate an idealized form of multihoming
route control where the end-network has instantaneous knowledge
about the performance and availability of routes via each of its ISPs
for any transfer. We also assume that the end-network can switch
between candidate paths to any destination as often as desired. Fi-
nally, we assume that the end-network can easily control the ISP
link traversed by packets destined for its network (referred to as
“inbound control”).
In a real implementation of multihoming route control, however,
there are practical limitations on the ability of an end-network to
track ISP performance, on the rate at which it can switch paths, and
on the extent of control over incoming packets. However, recent
work [4] shows that simple active and passive measurement-based
schemes can be employed to obtain near-optimal availability, and
RTT performance that is within 5-10% of the optimal, in practical
multihomed environments. Also, simple NAT-based techniques can
be employed to achieve inbound route control [4].
To ensure a fair comparison, we study a similarly agile form of
overlay routing where the end-point has timely and accurate knowl-
edge of the best performing, or most available, end-to-end overlay
paths. Frequent active probing of each overlay link, makes it pos-
sible to select and switch to the best overlay path at almost any
instant when the size of the overlay network is small ((cid:24)50 nodes)1.
We compare overlay routing and route control with respect to
the degree of ﬂexibility available at the end-network. In general,
1Such frequent probing is infeasible for larger overlays [6].
this ﬂexibility is represented by k, the number of ISPs available to
either technique at the end-network. In the case of route control,
we consider k-multihoming, where we evaluate the performance
and reliability of end-to-end candidate paths induced by a combi-
nation of k ISPs. For overlay routing, we introduce the notion of
k-overlays, where k is the number of providers available to an end-
point for any end-to-end overlay path. In other words, this is simply
overlay routing in the presence of k ISP connections.
When comparing k-multihoming with k-overlays, we report re-
sults based on the combination of k ISPs that gives the best per-
formance (RTT or throughput) across all destinations.
In prac-
tice an end-network cannot purchase connectivity from all available
providers, or easily know which combination of ISPs will provide
the best performance. Rather, our results demonstrate how much
ﬂexibility is necessary, in terms of the number of ISP connections,
and the maximum beneﬁt afforded by this ﬂexibility.

Figure 1 illustrates some possible route control and overlay con-
ﬁgurations. For example, (a) shows the case of conventional BGP
routing with a single default provider (i.e., 1-multihoming). Fig-
ure 1(b) depicts end-point route control with three ISPs (i.e., 3-
multihoming). Overlay routing with a single ﬁrst-hop provider (i.e.,
1-overlay) is shown in Figure 1(c), and Figure 1(d) shows the case
of additional ﬁrst-hop ﬂexibility in a 3-overlay routing conﬁgura-
tion.
We seek to answer the following key questions:
1. On what fraction of end-to-end paths does overlay routing
outperform multihoming route control in terms of RTT and
throughput? In these cases, what is the extent of the perfor-
mance difference?
2. What are the reasons for the performance differences? For
example, must overlay paths violate inter-domain routing poli-
cies to achieve good end-to-end performance?
3. Does route control, when supplied with sufﬁcient ﬂexibility
in the number of ISPs, achieve path availability rates that are
comparable with overlay routing?
4. MEASUREMENT TESTBED
Addressing the questions posed in Section 3 from the perspective
of an end-network requires an infrastructure which provides access
to a number of BGP path choices via multihomed connectivity, and
the ability to select among those paths at a ﬁne granularity. We
also require an overlay network with a reasonably wide deployment
to provide a good choice of arbitrary wide-area end-to-end paths
which could potentially bypass BGP policies.
We address both requirements with a single measurement testbed
consisting of nodes belonging to the server infrastructure of the
Akamai CDN. Following a similar methodology to that described
in [3], we emulate a multihoming scenario by selecting a few nodes
in a metropolitan area, each singly-homed to a different ISP, and
use them collectively as a stand-in for a multihomed network. Rela-
tive to previous overlay routing studies [25, 6], our testbed is larger
with 68 nodes. Also, since the nodes are all connected to com-
mercial ISPs, they avoid paths that traverse Internet2, which may
introduce unwanted bias due their higher bandwidth and lower like-
lihood of queuing, compared to typical Internet paths. Our mea-
surements are conﬁned to nodes located in the U.S., though we do
sample paths traversing ISPs at all levels of the Internet hierarchy
from vantage points in many major U.S. metropolitan areas.
The 68 nodes in our testbed span 17 U.S. cities, averaging about
four nodes per city, connected to commercial ISPs of various sizes.
The nodes are chosen to avoid multiple servers attached to the same
provider in a given city. The list of cities and the tiers of the cor-
responding ISPs are shown in Figure 2(a). The tiers of the ISPs
are derived from the work in [31]. The geographic distribution of
the testbed nodes is illustrated in Figure 2(b). We emulate multi-
homed networks in 9 of the 17 metropolitan areas where there are
at least 3 providers – Atlanta, Bay Area, Boston, Chicago, Dallas,
Los Angeles, New York, Seattle and Washington D.C.

5. LATENCY AND THROUGHPUT
PERFORMANCE
We now present our results on the relative latency and through-
put performance beneﬁts of multihoming route control compared
with overlay routing. We ﬁrst describe our data collection method-
ology (Section 5.1) and evaluation metrics (Section 5.2). Then,
we present the key results in the following order. First we com-
pare 1-multihoming against 1-overlays along the same lines as the
analysis in [25] (Section 5.3). Next, we compare the beneﬁts of us-
ing k-multihoming and k-overlay routing, relative to using default
paths through a single provider (Section 5.4). Then, we compare
k-multihoming against 1-overlay routing, for k (cid:21) 1 (Section 5.5).
Here, we wish to quantify the beneﬁt to end-systems of greater
ﬂexibility in the choice of BGP routes via multihoming, relative to
the power of 1-overlays. Next, we contrast k-multihoming against
k-overlay routing to understand the additional beneﬁts gained by
allowing end-systems almost arbitrary control on end-to-end paths,
