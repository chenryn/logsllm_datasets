### Protecting Data with Short-Lived Encryption Keys and Hardware Root of Trust
**Dan Griffin, DefCon 2013**

#### What Does the NSA Think?
- The NSA has publicly acknowledged:
  - The inevitability of mobile computing.
  - The need to support cloud-based services, even for handling secret data in the field.
- General Keith Alexander, former head of the NSA, recently discussed using smartphones as identification cards on classified networks.
- If these measures work for the NSA, they can also be effective for other organizations.

#### Introduction
- Mobile devices are ubiquitous and often insecure, leaking sensitive information like a sieve.
- Despite their vulnerabilities, the number of mobile devices continues to grow.
- How can we prevent the impending security implosion?

#### Current Technology Landscape
- **Why are mobile devices less secure?**
  - Entering secure passwords via touchscreens is cumbersome.
  - Current antimalware solutions are insufficient.
  - Many devices are personally owned (BYOD) and used in professional settings.
- **Hardware Considerations:**
  - Most mobile devices use ARM processors, which support Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0.
  - Some newer devices use Intel Atom processors with TPM 2.0.
  - What is preventing these devices from being more secure?

#### What is Needed to Ensure Security?
- **Measuring the Device's State:**
  - Utilize TPM, measured boot, and remote attestation.
  - Leverage ARM TrustZone (TZ) and System on Chip (SoC).
  - Send boot logs to the Remote Attestation Service (RAS).
  - Use measurements such as firmware hashes and timestamps.
- **Creating a Health Statement:**
  - Generate a health claim signed by the RAS.
  - Send this claim to the mobile device to prove its security status.

#### Using the Health Claim
- **Device Usage:**
  - The device can use the health claim to:
    - Prove its status to a service.
    - Unlock protected data on the device.
- **Insecure Devices:**
  - If the device is found to be insecure, it should undergo remediation.
  - This process is similar to Network Access Protection (NAP).

#### Remote Attestation Service (RAS)
- **Requirements:**
  - Secure data from the manufacturer.
  - Only Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) is protected by TPM.
  - Traditional antivirus (AV) checks user-mode code, verified by ELAM.
- **Trust Mechanism:**
  - The content provider must trust the RAS through a Registration Authority.

#### How Does the RAS Trust the Device?
- **TPM and Boot Process:**
  - TPM provides a hardware root of trust.
  - PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers) are accumulated in a secure location.
  - PCRs and boot logs are sent to the RAS, signed by the TPM.
  - Secure time (a boot counter) enhances security.

#### Is TPM/RAS Really Secure?
- **Technical Details:**
  - Firmware used by TPM 2.0 ensures security.
  - PCRs are stored securely.
  - Secure time provides an additional layer of security.

#### Proof-of-Concept Demo
- A demo of the proof-of-concept code has been presented at RSA and several three-letter agencies, confirming its effectiveness.

#### The Threat Model
- **Policy-Enforced File Access:**
  - BYOD environments.
  - Downloading sensitive files from document repositories.
  - Risk of leaving laptops unattended (e.g., in the back of a taxi).

#### What Remains to Be Done
- **Signature Collection:**
  - Gather signatures from all BIOS and early launch code.
- **Heuristics:**
  - Develop heuristics to determine if new code should be provisionally trusted.
- **Consumerization Trends:**
  - Understand the implications of consumerization for hackers.
- **Opportunities:**
  - Explore opportunities in this space.
