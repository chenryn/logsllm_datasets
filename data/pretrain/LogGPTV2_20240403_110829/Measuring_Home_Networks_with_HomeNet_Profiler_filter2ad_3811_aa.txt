## Abstract
This paper introduces HomeNet Profiler, a software tool designed to run on any computer within a home network. The tool collects a wide range of measurements, including the set of devices, services (using UPnP and Zeroconf), and characteristics of the WiFi environment. To attract a larger user base, HomeNet Profiler performs one-time, on-demand measurements. We evaluate this design choice by comparing it with periodic measurements from six home networks. Data collected from these six homes and over 1,600 homes in France provide insights into the diversity of devices connected to home networks and the variability of the WiFi neighborhood.

## 1. Introduction
The widespread availability of affordable broadband Internet has made home networking increasingly common. A typical household today can have a variety of networked devices, ranging from personal devices like laptops and smartphones to printers and media centers. These devices connect to each other and to the Internet via a local-area network, known as the home network. Despite growing interest in home networking, there is limited data available on current home networks. Most previous studies have focused on measuring and characterizing residential Internet access. The lack of data on home networks is partly due to the challenges of measuring them at scale. Most home networks are behind network address translators, making it difficult for external devices to measure their characteristics. Some prior studies have deployed measurement points inside a few volunteer homes, but it is challenging to obtain representative results from a small sample size.

This paper presents HomeNet Profiler, a tool designed to measure home network configuration and performance. Users can run HomeNet Profiler on-demand from an end-system directly connected to their home network. The tool scans the local network for active devices and services advertised via protocols such as Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) and measures the wireless environment. HomeNet Profiler includes features to encourage a large number of volunteers, such as performing one-time, on-demand measurements. We evaluate this design choice using periodic measurements from six homes in France.

Between April 2011 and May 2012, users from 46 different countries ran HomeNet Profiler. This paper analyzes home networks in France, where we have data from over 1,600 homes. We examine the devices present in home networks and the WiFi environment. Our results show that in 80% of homes, users connect fewer than a dozen devices to their home network. Additionally, only a small number of these devices, mainly home gateways, are active at any given time. We also observe significant variations in the density of the WiFi neighborhood across homes.

The main contribution of this paper is the design and evaluation of HomeNet Profiler. Our initial experience shows that HomeNet Profiler reached a large number of users (2,432 homes worldwide). Periodic measurements from six homes in Paris provide context for HomeNet Profiler's one-shot experiments by analyzing the dynamics of both the set of devices and the WiFi neighborhood. As more users run HomeNet Profiler, we plan to conduct a larger characterization study to provide a global perspective on home network performance and configuration.

## 2. Design
### 2.1 Requirements
The primary requirement for a home network data collection tool is that it runs from inside the home. External measurements cannot provide visibility into the home network configuration and its devices. Additional requirements include:

- **Ease of Use:** The tool should be simple to run, even for non-expert users.
- **Portability:** The tool should run on all home networks and end-systems.
- **Respect for User Privacy:** The tool should not collect private or personally identifiable information. It must comply with the rules of the French National Commission of Informatics and Freedom (CNIL).
- **Light User Commitment:** Users should not be required to commit too much time or resources.
- **Incentive for Participation:** Providing users with something valuable, such as a detailed report of their home network, can encourage participation.

### 2.2 Design and Implementation Decisions
The design requirements led to the following high-level decisions:

1. **End-System Deployment:** HomeNet Profiler runs on end-systems rather than on the home router/gateway. While some home users deploy routers with measurement capabilities, hardware deployment is more costly and logistically complex.
2. **One-Shot Measurements:** Inspired by the success of Netalyzr, HomeNet Profiler performs one-time, on-demand measurements. Long-term, periodic measurements would provide a complete picture but may raise privacy concerns and impact machine performance. We evaluate one-shot measurements against periodic measurements in Sections 4.1 and 5.1.
3. **Java Executable JAR:** HomeNet Profiler is implemented as a Java executable JAR, which is portable and easy for users to run. A signed Java applet was considered but discarded due to limitations in loading system libraries and requiring sudo rights.
4. **User Perspective:** HomeNet Profiler includes a user survey to gather information that is difficult to infer automatically. Users receive a detailed report of their home network as an incentive. They can select which measurements to execute, ensuring comfort and control.

### 2.3 Measurement Modules
HomeNet Profiler includes several measurement modules to learn about the home network:

- **Device Scan:** Searches the home network for active devices by populating the ARP cache and collecting vendor IDs and MAC addresses.
- **WiFi Scan:** Collects a list of access points, including ESSID, BSSID, channel number, and RSSI. ESSIDs and BSSIDs are anonymized.
- **Service Scan:** Queries Zeroconf and UPnP to discover advertised services.
- **Netalyzr:** Performs tests related to access network configuration, security, and performance.
- **UPnP Gateway Configuration:** Collects the model, connection type, and speed of the home gateway if it supports UPnP.

When HomeNet Profiler sends data to the server, it maps the client's public IP address to its geographical location and AS number using the Maxmind database. Personally-identifiable information is anonymized using SHA1 hash.

## 3. Measurements
### 3.1 Testbed
To complement HomeNet Profiler, we instrumented six home networks in Paris. Laptops were installed in homes of colleagues from Technicolor and UPMC Sorbonne Universités. Each laptop runs the WiFi scan module every ten seconds and the device scan module every ten minutes. Data was collected from March 19, 2012, to July 31, 2012. Although these six homes are not representative, they allow us to evaluate HomeNet Profiler and provide context for the collected data.

### 3.2 HomeNet Profiler Data
We announced HomeNet Profiler through various channels, including email and networking researcher mailing lists. Between April 2011 and May 2012, 2,721 distinct end-systems ran HomeNet Profiler 3,634 times. After applying heuristics, we inferred data from 2,432 distinct homes in 46 countries and 210 different ASes. This paper focuses on the 1,682 homes in France. Two-thirds of French users who completed the survey reported being well-versed in Internet technology, indicating a bias towards expert users.

## 4. Set of Devices in Home Networks
### 4.1 Completeness of Device Scans
Some devices may be disconnected from the home network when users run HomeNet Profiler. We evaluated the effectiveness of one-time device scans using our testbed data. Repeated device scans observed different sets of devices. Figure 1 shows the presence of devices over four months. The number of devices measured per home varied between 6 and 19. Devices were categorized into home devices (always-on and on-off) and visitor devices. We found that a single device scan captures a small fraction of home devices, but it reliably captures always-on devices.

In summary, HomeNet Profiler provides valuable insights into home network configurations and performance. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset and conducting a larger characterization study to understand global trends in home networking.
