# Receive Power Level (RPL) Calculation
The Receive Power Level (RPL) is calculated using the following formula:
\[ \text{RPL} = 10 \times \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_{\text{received}}}{P_{\text{reference}}} \right) \, \text{dBm} \]

# Circumventing Obstacles with Remote Attack Techniques
We have developed and present a technique that remote attackers can use to circumvent this obstacle.

# Obtaining Anchor Coordinates
Obtaining the anchor coordinates is the most challenging requirement. These coordinates are manually input at the initial installation and are never transmitted through the network.

- **Absolute Distance Estimation**: It is not possible to directly estimate the absolute distance due to evolving temporary conditions.
- **Power Level Information**: If at a given moment \( t_0 \), the power level information is identical, the tag \( j_0 \) that triggered those packets must be positioned at the same distance from all anchors.
  \[ \Delta(i_0, j_0, t_0) = \left( GT_{\text{reference}, j_0, t_0} - GT_{i_0, j_0, t_0} \right) \times c = 0 \]
- **Time of Flight Estimation**: Considering \( CS(\text{reference}, t_0) = 1 \) and \( ToF(\text{reference}) = 0 \), we can estimate the time of flights and thus the distances of the other anchors from the reference.
  \[ ToF(i_0) = CS(i_0, t_0) \times (pTS(i_0, j_0, t_0) - sTS(i_0, t_0)) - pTS(\text{reference}, j_0, t_0) + sTS(\text{reference}, t_0) \]

# Installation Constraints for Anchor Coordinates
- **Rectangular Map**: Given that the anchor map is often a rectangle, by arbitrarily setting the reference anchor in position (0, 0), the coordinates of all other anchors can be easily estimated using the two shortest distances.
- **Adapting Shape**: An attacker can adapt the expected shape based on the number of anchors detected in the communications.

# Testing and Results
- **Avalue RTLS Testing**: This was tested in the Avalue RTLS using both the First Path Power Level (FPPL) and the Receive Power Level (RPL).
- **Best Results**: The best results were obtained using FPPL with a threshold of ~1% between the lowest power level and the highest.
- **Estimation Accuracy**: It was possible to estimate the anchor coordinates with an error of less than 10% relative to the real values, which is accurate enough for attack scenarios where cm-level precision is not required.

# Adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
## Traffic Interception
Intercepting traffic requires two steps:
1. Gaining a foothold inside the anchors-server backhaul network.
2. Executing a Man in the Middle (MitM) attack.

### Network Access
- **Sewio and Avalue RTLS**: Both allow either Ethernet or Wi-Fi for the network backhaul.
- **Ethernet Network**: Gaining access requires compromising a computer in the network or adding a rogue device.
- **Wi-Fi Network**: Gaining access requires knowledge of the WPA2 password or exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless appliances.

### MitM Attack
- **ARP Spoofing**: In tests, it was possible to MitM both solutions via standard ARP spoofing attacks, which went undetected by the RTLS.
- **Example Command**:
  \[ \text{arpspoof} -i \text{attacker\_eth} -t \text{server\_ip} \text{anchor1\_ip} & \text{arpspoof} -i \text{attacker\_eth} -t \text{anchor1\_ip} \text{server\_ip} \]

## Passive Eavesdropping Attacks
1. **Position Shown in RTLS**: The target's position is shown in the RTLS.
2. **Traffic Interception**: Anchor coordinates are estimated, and timestamps are extracted.
3. **TDoA Algorithm**: A TDoA algorithm is applied.
4. **Target Position**: The attacker obtains the target's position.

## Active Traffic Manipulation Attacks
### Target Reconnaissance
- **Natural Movements**: To deceive an operator, the tag movements should appear natural.
- **Passive Eavesdropping**: This phase can be accomplished by performing a passive eavesdropping attack against the target.

### Active Traffic Filtering
- **Synchronization Packets**: Automatically forwarded to the destination.
- **Positioning Packets**: Modified if they are from a target; otherwise, forwarded unaltered.
- **Techniques**: Leveraging iptables NFQUEUE, a flexible userspace packet handler.

### Packet Information Manipulation
- **Known Coordinates**: The tag coordinates are known, and the positioning timestamps are unknown.
- **Timestamp Modification**: The attacker derives the modified positioning timestamps according to the target coordinates.
- **Checksum Recalculation**: The attacker re-computes the packet checksums and sends the modified packets.

## Attack Demos
- **Locating and Targeting People/Assets**
- **Geofencing**
- **Contact Tracing**

## Remediations
### Segregation and Firewall Rules
- **Advantages**: Quick mitigation, traditional solutions like VLANs, IEEE 802.1X, and firewall rules.
- **Challenges**: Some RTLS servers expose core network services on all interfaces, requiring strict firewall rules.

### Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- **Goal**: Detect signs of MitM attacks.
- **Challenges**: Does not protect from physical MitM attacks.

### Traffic Encryption
- **Advantages**: Closest to solving the problem, allows basic RTLS functionalities to remain unaltered.
- **Challenges**: Higher load, reduced accuracy, depends on vendor accessibility.

## Summary and Key Takeaways
- **Wireless Technology Benefits**: Increases efficiency and productivity while reducing cabling costs.
- **Security Loopholes**: IEEE 802.15.4z has out-of-scope areas, creating security loopholes.
- **Zero-Day Discoveries**: Nozomi Networks Labs discovered zero-days in two popular UWB RTLS.
- **UWB RTLS Uses**: Personnel tracking, geofencing, contact tracing.
- **Threat Actor TTPs**: MitM and eavesdropping or manipulation tactics.
- **Mitigations**: Segregation, firewall rules, IDS, and traffic encryption.

- **Weak Security Requirements**: Can lead to safety issues.
- **Unnoticed Attack Surfaces**: Significant consequences if compromised.
- **Exploiting Secondary Communications**: Challenging but doable.
