User: How can I find where my local development datastore is located? I am using the Python SDK and Linux.
Assistant: To find the file location for the local AppEngine datastore on MacOSX/Python, you can run the following command:
dev_appserver.py -help
Mine was at something like:
/var/folders/uP/uP1GHkGKGqO7QPq+eGMmb++++TI/-Tmp-/dev_appserver.datastore
