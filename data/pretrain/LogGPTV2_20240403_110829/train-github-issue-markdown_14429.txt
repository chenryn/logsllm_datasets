## Expected Behavior
Letters should not be cut off in input fields.
## Current Behavior
Letters with descenders are cut off in input fields (in Firefox, not in
Chrome).
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Type `jjyyqqpp` in a Material-UI text field in Firefox.
  2. Observe that the bottoms of the letters are cut off.
## Context
This StackOverflow question/answer suggest changing the height of the input to
match its line height. I see that the computed `line-height` is `21.5px`, so I
changed my input's `height` to `21.5px` and it fixed the problem. I doubt that
this is any more than a hack, though.
