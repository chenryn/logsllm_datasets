User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How does CAPTCHA mitigate DDoS attacks? This seems like an easy question, but I've failed to find an answer.

One of the uses of CAPTCHA is to cope mitigate Denial of Service attacks. Suppose an adversary performs excessive login attempts, leaving other users unable to log in; the service can require solving a CAPTCHA before logging in. But why, in this case, does the CAPTCHA service continue to run while the login service fails under the same traffic load? Why does it work?

Snark aside, CAPTCHA is a very poor solution for D/DoS protection. While it does have some effect, this is minimal, and easily compensated for by the attackers.   

CAPTCHA solves the wrong problem for this, and solves it badly.
CAPTCHA does not try to rate-limit the connections; it is not intended to protect the login mechanism from attacks; it is not possible for CAPTCHA to differentiate between attackers and legitimate users.   

The only thing it does do - and not very well, at that - is, not surprisingly: Tell Computers and Humans Apart. This might in fact be useful to you, if you were in a Matrix-like reality, where all Computers are the enemy, and all Humans are allies.
In our reality, that is a pointless differentiation. Ostensibly, this might help with preventing scripted attacks - but even if this were true (it's not), there are plenty of ways to bypass that requirement - e.g. CAPTCHA proxies (where you need to solve a CAPTCHA before we show you dem pr0n) and CAPTCHA farms (where you hire some fareasterners to "solve" CAPTCHA for you, at 4$ per 1000 pops).
Moreover, in the case of DDoS - often this attack is mounted by "political movement" - i.e. large masses of humans decide to bring down a certain site. So yeah, CAPTCHA would be irrelevant here.   

Besides all that, state-of-the-art CAPTCHA is far behind state-of-the-art OCR. If you want your users to easily decipher those squiggly images - the computer can do this too, pretty well. The best CAPTCHAs were measured at 20% OCR success rate - which effectively means that for every successful request, the attacker would simply need to send 5 requests. Not quite the order of magnitude that would make a substantial difference, to an attacker that is already planning on mounting a DDoS.   



Some of my other posts here and on SO regarding this: 


A good summary here on Sec.SE
Practical non-image based CAPTCHA approaches? on SO 
Has reCaptcha been cracked / hacked / OCR'd / defeated / broken? on SO 




TL;DR:
The question is based on a faulty assumption: 


  How does CAPTCHA defend from DDoS attacks?  


It doesn't.
At most it might require a bit more effort from the attacker, but not much.
