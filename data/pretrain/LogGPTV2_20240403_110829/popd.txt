### `popd` Command

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `popd` command changes the current directory to the most recently stored directory by the `pushd` command. Each time you use the `pushd` command, a directory is added to a virtual stack. This stack allows you to store multiple directories in the order they were pushed.

**How It Works:**
- When you use the `pushd` command, the current directory is stored at the bottom of the stack.
- Subsequent uses of `pushd` add new directories to the top of the stack.
- The `popd` command removes the top directory from the stack and changes the current directory to that directory.
- If command extensions are enabled, `popd` also removes any drive-letter assignments created by the `pushd` command.

**Syntax:**
```cmd
popd
```

**Parameters:**
- **/?:** Displays help information for the `popd` command at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

To change the current directory to a specified directory, delete all `.txt` files in that directory, and then return to the original directory, you can use the following batch script:

```cmd
@echo off
rem This batch file deletes all .txt files in a specified directory
pushd %1
del *.txt
popd
cls
echo All text files deleted in the %1 directory
```

In this example:
- `pushd %1` changes the current directory to the one specified as the first argument (`%1`).
- `del *.txt` deletes all `.txt` files in the new current directory.
- `popd` returns the current directory to the original directory before the `pushd` command was executed.
- `cls` clears the screen.
- `echo All text files deleted in the %1 directory` prints a message indicating that the text files have been deleted.

This script ensures that the current directory is restored after the operations are completed, maintaining the original working environment.
