I am attempting to set up `easy_install` on my Mac, but I'm encountering the following error:

```
Installing Setuptools
running install
Checking .pth file support in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/
error: can't create or remove files in install directory
The following error occurred while trying to add or remove files in the installation directory:
[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/test-easy-install-789.pth'
The installation directory you specified (via --install-dir, --prefix, or the distutils default setting) was:
/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/
```

It appears that I do not have the necessary permissions to write to the specified directory. Could you please provide a solution for this access-related issue? 

**Suggested Solution:**
To resolve this permission issue, you can try using `sudo` to run the installation with elevated privileges. Use the following command:

```sh
curl -o - https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py | sudo python
```

This command will download and execute the `ez_setup.py` script with superuser permissions, which should allow the installation to proceed without any permission errors.
