(I don't know if it's really a bug or if we're not supposed to do this, but it
works fine when using jsx)
When using the arrow function as a module exports, the generated code is
wrong.  
The following (useless but minimal) example
    module.exports = () => arguments;
will lead to the generated code
    var _arguments = arguments;
    module.exports = function () {
      return _arguments;
    };
while
    module.exports = function () { return arguments; };
leads to the correct version.
