### Figure 12: Bohatei Enables Rapid Response and Restores Throughput of Legitimate Traffic

**Key Takeaway:**
Bohatei can help networks respond rapidly (within one minute) to diverse attacks and restore the performance of legitimate traffic. We repeated the experiments with UDP as the benign traffic, and in this case, the recovery time was even shorter because the throughput does not suffer from the congestion control mechanism of TCP.

### Hardware Cost

We measured the total number of virtual machines (VMs) needed to handle a given attack volume and compared two cases:
1. Monolithic VMs embedding the entire defense logic for an attack.
2. Using Bohatei’s fine-grained modular scaling.

Table 3 shows the number of VMs required to handle different types of 100 Gbps attacks. Fine-grained scaling reduces hardware costs by 2.1–5.4 times compared to monolithic VMs. Assuming a commodity server costs $3,000 and can run 40 VMs in Bohatei, the total hardware cost to handle a 100 Gbps attack is less than $32,000. In contrast, using monolithic VMs, the total server cost for the same scenario would be about $160,000. Additionally, since Bohatei is horizontally scalable, dealing with larger attacks simply requires a linear increase in the number of VMs.

### Routing Efficiency

To quantify how Bohatei addresses the routing inefficiency of existing solutions, we conducted the following experiment. For each topology, we measured the end-to-end latency in two equivalently provisioned scenarios:
1. The location of the DDoS defense appliance is the node with the highest betweenness value.
2. Bohatei.

As a baseline, we consider the betweenness value, which measures a node’s centrality as the fraction of the network’s all-pairs shortest paths that pass through that node.

### Number of Forwarding Rules

Figure 11 shows the maximum number of rules required on a switch across different topologies for the SYN flood attack. Using today’s flow-based forwarding, each new flow will require a rule. Using tag-based forwarding, the number of rules depends on the number of VM instances, reducing the switch rule space by four orders of magnitude. For other attack types, we observed consistent results (not shown). To put this in context, the typical capacity of an SDN switch is 3K-4K rules (shared across various network management tasks). This means that per-flow rules will not suffice for attacks beyond 10 Gbps. In contrast, Bohatei can handle hundreds of Gbps of attack traffic; for example, a 1 Tbps attack will require fewer than 1K rules on a switch.

### Benefit of Scale-Out Load Balancing

We measured the resources consumed by a dedicated load balancing solution. Across different types of attacks with a fixed rate of 10 Gbps, we observed that a dedicated load balancer design requires between 220–300 VMs for load balancing alone. By delegating the load balancing task to the VMs, our design eliminates the need for these extra load balancers (not shown).

### Bohatei End-to-End Effectiveness

We evaluated the effectiveness of Bohatei under four different types of DDoS attacks. We launched the attack traffic of the corresponding type at the 10th second, and the attack was sustained for the duration of the experiment. In each scenario, we chose the attack volume such that it could bring the throughput of the benign traffic to zero. Figure 12 shows the impact of attack traffic on the throughput of benign traffic. The Y-axis for each scenario shows the network-wide throughput for TCP traffic (a total of 10 Gbps if there is no attack). The results shown in this figure are based on Cogent, the largest topology with 196 switches; the results for other topologies were consistent and are not shown.
