## Abstract
Every day, billions of users browse the web, leaving digital traces on millions of websites. Each visit, mouse movement, or button click can trigger a wide variety of hidden data exchanges across multiple tracking companies. These companies collect vast amounts of user data, preferences, and habits, which are extremely valuable for online advertisers and profitable for data brokers, but highly concerning for user privacy.

In this 3-hour tutorial, we will cover a wide range of web tracking technologies, from simple cookies to advanced cross-device fingerprinting. We will describe the main mechanisms behind web tracking and what users can do to protect themselves. Additionally, we will discuss solutions that web developers can use to automatically eliminate tracking from third-party content in their applications. This tutorial is designed for a general audience of computer scientists and does not require any specific prerequisite knowledge.

### Key Topics
- **Third-Party Cookie Tracking and Other Stateful Techniques:** Methods that enable tracking across multiple websites.
- **Cookie Respawning:** Techniques used to re-create deleted user cookies.
- **Cookie Synchronization:** Allowing trackers and ad agencies to synchronize user IDs across different companies.
- **Browser Fingerprinting:** Including Canvas, WebRTC, and AudioContext fingerprinting.
- **Cross-Device Fingerprinting:** Techniques that allow trackers to recognize users across several devices.

We will demonstrate the prevalence of these techniques based on previous research and present the advertisement ecosystem, particularly focusing on Real-Time Bidding (RTB). We will explain how cookie synchronization is used in RTB and present recent analyses on the value of user tracking data. We will also discuss the mechanisms website owners use to interact with ad agencies and the consequences for user security and privacy.

To help users protect themselves from web tracking, we will provide an overview of existing solutions, starting with browser settings and showing that basic third-party cookie tracking is still possible even in private browsing modes. We will then present privacy-protecting browser extensions and compare their effectiveness. Finally, we will discuss protection mechanisms based on browser randomization to guard against advanced fingerprinting techniques.

For web developers, we will present solutions to include third-party content in their websites while automatically removing any tracking of their users. We will discuss simple solutions for social plugin integration and propose more advanced server-side-based solutions from our own research.

## Author Bio
Nataliia Bielova is a Research Scientist at Inria, the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation. She is internationally recognized for her work on applying formal methods to the security and privacy of web browsers. Her primary interests lie in privacy- and transparency-enhancing technologies for web applications. Nataliia works on the measurement, detection, and prevention of web tracking, including advanced behavior-based fingerprinting. She received the French Doctoral Supervision and Research Award (PEDR) in 2017. Before obtaining her permanent position in 2013, she was a postdoctoral researcher at Inria Rennes from 2012 to 2013, where she worked on the automatic detection of web tracking scripts using program analysis. She received her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Trento, Italy, in 2011.

## 1. How Does Web Tracking Work?
Web tracking involves content embedded in a webpage (trackers) recognizing the users visiting the page. Unlike analytics, trackers typically originate from a "third-party" domain, meaning they belong to a different domain than the hosting webpage. Because trackers are from a third-party domain, they can recognize users across different websites where these trackers are embedded.

The basic tracking mechanism based on cookies is illustrated in Figure 1. When a user visits theonion.com, the browser loads additional third-party content from tracker.com. This content sets up a browser cookie with a value, such as "789," which is stored in the browser. Upon a later request to a different website, such as cnn.com, the third-party tracker, tracker.com, will recognize the same user "789" and thus learn that this user has visited both theonion.com and cnn.com.

## 2. Advertisement and Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is a key mechanism used by advertisement agencies to target users online. The advertisement ecosystem has grown substantially over the past decade, leveraging both standard and advanced web tracking technologies. We will show how this ecosystem has expanded and present the main web technologies used in advertising. Researchers have found that cookie synchronization is a crucial component of RTB and have analyzed the value of user tracking data, which is often sold for less than $0.0005. It has been revealed that in RTB, website owners and ad agencies often collaborate closely, sometimes bypassing basic web security protections like the Same-Origin Policy. We will discuss the potential security issues raised by such collaboration.

## 3. Protection from Web Tracking
The most common way to prevent cookie tracking is to configure the browser to explicitly block third-party cookies. Even though research shows that cookies can be "respawned" in the presence of other tracking techniques, blocking third-party cookies is a first step in protecting oneself. Private browsing modes in modern browsers offer some protection, but they do not disable third-party cookies.

Another line of defense is through browser extensions. Popular privacy extensions include AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, uBlock, Disconnect, and Privacy Badger. AdBlock Plus and uBlock rely on community-driven rulesets to define whether certain third-party content is a tracker, but they may not provide full protection if a tracker uses a new, unlisted domain. Ghostery and Disconnect create blocking rules internally, while Privacy Badger uses heuristics to automatically detect third-party trackers. None of these extensions can guarantee 100% protection, but they can prevent well-known companies from tracking you on the web. Recent research has measured the effectiveness of these extensions on the top 200,000 websites.

While the solutions above can protect against many known trackers, they may be less effective against device fingerprinting. To protect against this advanced stateless tracking, the simplest method is to disable JavaScript, although this may not be practical. Several web browsers proposed by researchers aim to protect against fingerprinting through the randomization of browser properties.

Finally, web developers can also take steps to protect their users from web tracking. This choice may be driven by ethical reasons or regulatory requirements. We will discuss simple solutions for integrating social plugins and propose more advanced server-side-based solutions from our own research.
