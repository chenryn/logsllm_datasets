ABSTRACT
Billions of users browse the Web on a daily basis, leaving
their digital traces on millions of websites. Every such visit,
every mouse move or button click may trigger a wide variety
of hidden data exchanges across multiple tracking companies.
As a result, these companies collect a vast amount of user’s
data, preferences and habits, that are extremely useful for
online advertisers and pro(cid:12)table for data brokers, however
very worrisome for the privacy of the users.
In this 3-hours tutorial we will cover the vide variety of
Web tracking technologies, ranging from simple cookies to
advanced cross-device (cid:12)ngerprinting. We will describe the
main mechanisms behind web tracking and what users can
do to protect themselves. Moreover, we will discuss solutions
Web developers can use to automatically eliminate tracking
from the third-party content they include in their applica-
tions. This tutorial will be of interest to a general audience
of computer scientists, and we do not require any speci(cid:12)c
prerequisite knowledge for attendees.
We will cover the following tracking mechanisms:
(cid:15) third-party cookie tracking, and other stateful track-
ing techniques that enables tracking across multiple
websites [26, 28, 29],
(cid:15) cookie respawning that is used to re-create deleted user
cookies [7, 27],
(cid:15) cookie synching that allows trackers and ad agencies
to synchronise user IDs across diﬀerent companies [13,
24],
(cid:15) browser (cid:12)ngerprinting, including Canvas, WebRTC and
AudioContext (cid:12)ngerprinting [6, 11, 13, 21]
(cid:15) cross-browser device (cid:12)ngerprinting, allowing trackers
to recognise users across several devices [10].
We will then demonstrate prevalence of such techniques on
the Web, based on previous research [6, 13, 17, 22, 26, 31].
We will present the advertisement ecosystem and explain
how Web technologies are used in advertisement, in particu-
lar in Real-Time-Bidding (RTB). We will explain how cookie
synching is used in RTB and present recent analysis on how
much a user’s tracking data is worth [24]. We will discuss the

mechanisms the website owners use to automatically inter-
act with the ad agencies [23], and explain its consequences
on user’s security and privacy.
To help users protect themselves from Web tracking, we
will give an overview of existing solutions. We’ll start with
the browser settings, and show that basic third-party cookie
tracking is still possible even in the private browser mode
of most common Web browsers. We then present privacy-
protecting browser extensions and compare how eﬃcient they
are in protection from Web tracking [19]. Then, we’ll present
possible protection mechanisms based on browser randomi-
sation [15, 16] to protect from advanced (cid:12)ngerprinting tech-
niques.
Finally, we will present solutions for Web developers, who
want to include third-party content in their websites, but
would like to automatically remove any tracking of their
users. In particular, we will discuss simple solutions that
exist today for social plugins integration [25], and propose
more advanced server-side based solutions that are a result
of our own research [30].

1 HOW DOES WEB TRACKING
WORK?
Web tracking is the practice when some content ("track-
ers") embedded in a webpage recognises the users visiting
the page. Diﬀerently from analytics, trackers are usually

REAL-TIME-BIDDING
Real-Time-Bidding (RTB) is one of the main mechanisms
that advertisement agencies are using to target users online.
The advertisement ecosystem has substantially grown in the
last 10 years, building on standard and more advanced web
tracking technologies. We will show how fast this ecosystem
has grown over the last years, and present main Web tech-
nologies used in advertisement. Researchers have detected
that cookie synching is the main component of RTB and
analysed how much a user’s tracking data is worth in RTB:
it is often sold for less than $0.0005 [24]. It was revealed
that in RTB, the website owners and the ad agencies often
tightly cooperate [23]. Such collaboration sometimes leads
to bypassing basic Web security protections implemented by
the browser, such as the Same-Origin-Policy. We discuss po-
tential security issues raised by such collaboration.
3 PROTECTION FROM WEB
TRACKING
The most common way to prevent most of the cookie track-
ing is to use the browser con(cid:12)guration and explicitly block
third-party cookies. Even though research shows that in pres-
ence of other tracking techniques, cookies can be "respawned",
the fact that the browser itself does not set, and moreover,
does not send any third-party cookies, is already the (cid:12)rst
step to protect yourself. Private browsing modes in modern
browser provide some protection as well, however they do
not disable third-party cookies.
Another line of protection is by browser extensions. Ad-
Block Plus [1], Ghostery [3], uBlock [5], Disconnect [2] and
Privacy Badger [4] are the most used privacy extensions in
2016 [19]. AdBlock Plus and uBlock rely on two community-
driven rulesets that de(cid:12)ne whether a certain third-party con-
tent is a tracker. However, they do not provide full protec-
tion because if a tracker sets up a new domain not present in
these rulesets, tracking via such domain will not be blocked.
Ghostery and Disconnect create blocking rules internally.
Diﬀerently from rule-based approaches, Privacy Badger uses
heuristics to automatically detect third-party trackers on-
the-(cid:13)y. Even though none of these extensions can guarantee
a 100% protection, they however disallow well-known com-
panies to track you on the Web. Recently, researchers have
measured the eﬀectiveness of all these extensions on the top
200,000 websites [19].
Most of the solutions presented above do protect from
a signi(cid:12)cant number of known trackers, but may be less
eﬀective against device (cid:12)ngerprinting. To protect yourself
from this advanced stateless tracking, the simplest way is
to disable JavaScript, however this may be not very practi-
cal. Several web browsers, proposed by researchers, aim at
protecting from (cid:12)ngerprinting through the randomisation of
browser properties [15, 16, 20].
Finally, website developers might also be interested in
protecting their users from web tracking. This choice may
be important either due to ethical reasons, or requirement

"third-party" meaning that they belong to a diﬀerent do-
main than the hosting webpage. Because trackers are orig-
inating from a third-party domain, they are able recognise
user’s across diﬀerent websites where these trackers are em-
bedded [17, 18, 26].
The basic tracking mechanism based on cookies is shown
in Figure 1. When a user visits theonion.com, the browser
loads additional third-party content from tracker.com. This
content sets up a browser cookie with value "789" that is au-
tomatically stored in the browser. Upon a later request to a
diﬀerent website cnn.com, the third-party tracker tracker.com
will recognise the same user "789" and thus will learn that
this user has been to theonion.com and cnn.com.
