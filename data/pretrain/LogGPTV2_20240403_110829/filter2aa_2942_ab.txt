 INTRODUCTION 
nformation and communications technology (ICT) and operational technology (OT) rely on a 
complex, globally distributed, extensive, and interconnected supply chain ecosystem that is 
comprised of geographically diverse routes and consists of multiple levels of outsourcing. 
This ecosystem is composed of public and private sector entities (e.g., acquirers, suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers)1 that interact to research, develop, design, manufacture, acquire, deliver, 
integrate, operate, maintain, dispose of, and otherwise utilize or manage ICT/OT products and 
services. These interactions are shaped and influenced by a set of technologies, laws, policies, 
procedures, and practices.  
This ecosystem has evolved to provide a set of highly refined, cost-effective, and reusable 
solutions. Public and private sector entities have rapidly adopted this ecosystem of solutions and 
increased their reliance on commercially available products, system integrator support for 
custom-built systems, and external service providers. This, in turn, has increased the complexity, 
diversity, and scale of these entities.  
In this document, the term supply chain refers to the linked set of resources and processes 
between and among multiple levels of an enterprise, each of which is an acquirer that begins 
with the sourcing of products and services and extends through the product and service life 
cycle.  
Given the definition of supply chain, cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain2,3 refers 
to the potential for harm or compromise that may arise from suppliers, their supply chains, their 
products, or their services. Cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain are the results of 
threats that exploit vulnerabilities or exposures within products and services that traverse the 
supply chain or threats that exploit vulnerabilities or exposures within the supply chain itself. 
Examples of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain include:  
1) A widget manufacturer whose design material is stolen in another country, resulting in the 
loss of intellectual property and market share. 
2) A widget manufacture that experiences a supply disruption for critical manufacturing 
components due to a ransomware attack at a supplier three tiers down in the supply chain. 
3) A store chain that experiences a massive data breach tied to an HVAC vendor with access to 
the store chain’s data-sharing portal.  
Note that SCRM and C-SCRM refer to the same concept for the purposes of NIST publications.  
In general practice, C-SCRM is at the nexus of traditional Supply Chain Risk Management 
1 See the Glossary for definitions for suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers. 
2 In the 2015 version of SP 800-161, NIST used the term “ICT supply chain.”  In this revision, NIST has intentionally moved away from this term 
as cybersecurity risks can arise in all product and service supply chains, including both ICT and non-technology supply chains. 
3 In an effort to harmonize terminology, the expression “cybersecurity risk in supply chains” should be considered equivalent to “cyber risk in 
supply chains” for the purposes of this document. In the same manner, the expression “cybersecurity supply chain risk management” should be 
considered equivalent to “cyber supply chain risk management.”

(SCRM) and traditional Information Security. Organizations may employ different terms and 
definitions for SCRM outside of the scope of this publication. This publication does not address 
many of the non-cybersecurity aspects of SCRM.  
Technology solutions provided through a supply chain of competing vendors offer significant 
benefits, including low cost, interoperability, rapid innovation, and product feature variety. 
Whether proprietary, government-developed, or open source, these solutions can meet the needs 
of a global base of public and private sector customers. However, the same factors that create 
such benefits also increase the potential for cybersecurity risks that arise directly or indirectly 
from the supply chain. Cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain are often undetected and 
impact the acquirer and the end-user. For example, deployed software is typically a commercial 
off-the-shelf (COTS) product, which includes smaller COTS or open source software 
components developed or sourced at multiple tiers. Updates to software deployed across 
enterprises often fail to update the smaller COTS components with known vulnerabilities, 
including cases in which the component vulnerabilities are exploitable in the larger enterprise 
software. Software users may be unable to detect the smaller known vulnerable components in 
larger COTS software (e.g., lack of transparency, insufficient vulnerability management, etc.). 
The non-standardized nature of C-SCRM practices adds an additional layer of complexity as this 
makes the consistent measurement and management of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply 
chain difficult for both the organization and members of its supply chain (e.g., suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers). 
In this document, the practices and controls described for Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk 
Management (C-SCRM) apply to both information technology (IT) and operational technology 
(OT) environments and is inclusive of IoT. Similar to IT environments that rely on ICT 
products and services, OT environments rely on OT and ICT products and services, with 
cybersecurity risks arising from ICT/OT products, services, suppliers, and their supply chains. 
Enterprises should include OT-related suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers within the scope of their C-
SCRM activities.  
When engaging with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, 
and other ICT/OT-related service providers, agencies should carefully consider the breadth of the 
Federal Government’s footprint and the high likelihood that individual agencies may enforce 
varying and conflicting C-SCRM requirements. Overcoming this complexity requires 
interagency coordination and partnerships. The passage of the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain 
Security Act (FASCSA) of 2018 aimed to address this concern by creating a government-wide 
approach to the problem of supply chain security in federal acquisitions by establishing the 
Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC). The FASC serves as a focal point of coordination 
and information sharing and a harmonized approach to acquisition security that addresses C-
SCRM in acquisition processes and procurements across the federal enterprise. In addition, the 
law incorporated SCRM into FISMA by requiring reports on the progress and effectiveness of 
the agency’s supply chain risk management, consistent with guidance issued by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) and the Council.

Note that this publication uses the term “enterprise” to describe Level 1 of the risk management 
hierarchy. In practice, an organization is defined as an entity of any size, complexity, or 
positioning within a larger enterprise structure (e.g., a federal agency or company). By this 
definition, an enterprise is an organization, but it exists at the top level of the hierarchy where 
individual senior leaders have unique risk management responsibilities [NISTIR 8286]. Several 
organizations may comprise an enterprise. In these cases, an enterprise may have multiple Level 
1s with stakeholders and activities defined at both the enterprise and the organization levels. 
Level 1 activities conducted at the enterprise level should inform those activities completed 
within the subordinate organizations. Enterprises and organizations tailor the C-SCRM practices 
described in this publication as applicable and appropriate based on their own unique enterprise 
structure. There are cases in this publication in which the term “organization” is inherited from a 
referenced source (e.g., other NIST publication, regulatory language). Refer to NISTIR 8286, 
Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), for further guidance on this 
topic.

1.1. 
Purpose 
Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) is a systematic process for managing 
exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and developing appropriate response 
strategies, policies, processes, and procedures. The purpose of this publication is to provide 
guidance to enterprises on how to identify, assess, select, and implement risk management 
processes and mitigating controls across the enterprise to help manage cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain. The content in this guidance is the shared responsibility of different 
disciplines with different SCRM perspectives, authorities, and legal considerations. 
The C-SCRM guidance provided in this document is not one-size-fits-all. Instead, the guidance 
throughout this publication should be adopted and tailored to the unique size, resources, and risk 
circumstances of each enterprise. Enterprises adopting this guidance may vary in how they 
implement C-SCRM practices internally. To that end, this publication describes C-SCRM 
practices observed in enterprises and offers a general prioritization of C-SCRM practices (i.e., 
Foundational, Sustaining, Enabling)4 for enterprises to consider as they implement and mature 
C-SCRM.  However, this publication does not offer a specific roadmap for enterprises to follow 
to reach various states of capability and maturity.   
The processes and controls identified in this document can be modified or augmented with 
enterprise-specific requirements from policies, guidelines, response strategies, and other sources. 
This publication empowers enterprises to develop C-SCRM strategies tailored to their specific 
mission and business needs, threats, and operational environments. 
1.2. 
Target Audience 
C-SCRM is an enterprise-wide activity that should be directed as such from a governance 
perspective, regardless of the specific enterprise structure.

Background 
C-SCRM encompasses activities that span the entire SDLC, including research and development, 
design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, disposal, 
and the overall management of an enterprise’s products and services. Enterprises should 
integrate C-SCRM within the SDLC as this is a critical area for addressing cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain. C-SCRM is the organized and purposeful management of 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. C-SCRM requires enterprise recognition and 
awareness, and it lies at the intersections of security, suitability, safety, reliability, usability, 
quality, integrity, efficiency, maintainability, scalability, and resilience, as depicted in Figure 1-
1. These dimensions are layers of consideration for enterprises as they approach C-SCRM and 
should be positively impacted by C-SCRM.

Fig. 1-1: Dimensions of C-SCRM 
• Culture and Awareness is the set of shared values, practices, goals, and attitudes of the 
organization that set the stage for successful C-SCRM. It includes a learning process that 
influences individual and enterprise attitudes and understanding to realize the importance 
of C-SCRM and the adverse consequences of its failure.6 
• Security provides the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of (a) information that 
describes the supply chain (e.g., information about the paths of products and services, 
both logical and physical); (b) information, products, and services that traverse the supply 
chain (e.g., intellectual property contained in products and services); and/or (c) 
information about the parties participating in the supply chain (anyone who touches a 
product or service throughout its life cycle). 
• Suitability is focused on the supply chain and the provided products and services being 
right and appropriate for the enterprise and its purpose. 
• Safety is focused on ensuring that the product or service is free from conditions that can 
cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or 
damage to the environment. 7 
• Reliability is focused on the ability of a product or service to function as defined for a 
specified period of time in a predictable manner.8

• Usability is focused on the extent to which a product or service can be used by specified 
users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a 
specified context of use.9 
• Quality is focused on meeting or exceeding performance, technical, and functional 
specifications while mitigating vulnerabilities and weaknesses that may limit the intended 
function of a component or delivery of a service, lead to component or service failure, or 
provide opportunities for exploitation. 
• Efficiency is focused on the timeliness of the intended result delivered by a product or 
service. 
• Maintainability is focused on the ease of a product or service to accommodate change 
and improvements based on past experience in support of expanding future derived 
benefits. 
• Integrity is focused on guarding products and the components of products against 
improper modification or tampering and ensuring authenticity and pedigree. 
• Scalability is the capacity of a product or service to handle increased growth and 
demand. 
• Resilience is focused on ensuring that a product, service, or the supply chain supports the 
enterprise’s ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and 
recover rapidly from disruptions. Resilience includes the ability to withstand and recover 
from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring threats or incidents. 
1.5.1. Enterprise’s Supply Chain 
Contemporary enterprises run complex information systems and networks to support their
