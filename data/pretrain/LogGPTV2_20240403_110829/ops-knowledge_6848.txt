User: Is there any cross-platform way to check that my Python script is executed with admin rights? Unfortunately, os.getuid() is UNIX-only and is not available under Windows.
Assistant: Try doing whatever you need admin rights for, and check for failure.
This will only work for some things though, what are you trying to do?
