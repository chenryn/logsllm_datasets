For a system near saturation (i.e. ρ ≈ 1), classic heavy
trafﬁc waiting time approximations for preemptive ﬁxed
priority ﬁfo queues [13] are given by Equation 5,
P[background event waiting time ≤ t]
= Wb(t) = 1 − exp(− γ(1−ρ)µ2t
)

where γ = γm = 1 for M/M/1 background trafﬁc and
γ = γu = 3 for U/U/1 background trafﬁc. Unfortunately,
there is no ﬁxed utiliztion at which all systems can be de-
clared in a state of heavy trafﬁc (HT). Equation 5 might be
a reasonable approximation for ρ = 0.90 in some systems,
and might be very optimistic even when ρ = 0.99 in oth-
ers. γm  0, we have x0 +y0 +gapi >
x0 + gapi(ρ2)−1. This gives

Only when the hyperperiod is suitably long does the
ﬂuid ﬂow discharge behavior shown in Figure 5 accurately
capture the system behavior. Figure 6 gives an example
