Do you have any guidance on how to pass a native `WebGLTexture` to a shader in a Three.js material?

We are sharing the Three.js WebGL context to perform a series of calculations on the GPU. The primary goal is to render the final data using Three.js, so I need to use my output texture (a `WebGLTexture`) as a `sampler2D` uniform in a `THREE.RawShaderMaterial`. I am unsure if this is possible using the available Three.js API.

Thank you in advance for your help, and keep up the great work!
