Do you have any clue for passing a native WebGLTexture to one Shader in a
Three material?
We are sharing the Three gl context to do a series of calculations and stuff
on the GPU, but the main purpose is to render the final data with three, so I
need to put my output texture (WebGLTexture) as a Sampler2D uniform in a
THREE.RawShaderMaterial. I don't know if this is possible using the available
API of the engine.
Thanks in advance and keep up the great work!
