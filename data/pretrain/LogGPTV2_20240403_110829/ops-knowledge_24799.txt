User: What is containerization technology (Docker) in modern cloud computing? What is the difference between it and traditional virtualization?
Assistant: Containerization technology (Docker) is a virtualization technology that uses operating system-level virtualization technology to package applications and their dependent libraries into containers to achieve lightweight deployment, management, and migration of applications. Compared with traditional virtualization technology, containerization technology has the following significant advantages: 1. Lightweight: traditional virtualization technology needs to allocate certain system resources for each virtual machine, including disk space, memory, CPU clock cycle, etc. , while containerization technology can share the resources of the host, thus avoiding the waste and redundancy of virtual machine resources. 2. Fast startup: Containerization technology can start a container in seconds, while traditional virtualization technology takes several minutes to start a virtual machine. 3. Flexible and portable: containerization technology packages applications and dependent libraries into containers, and its runtime environment is separated from the host, so that it can run on various platforms and environments, and migration and deployment are relatively convenient. 4. Weak isolation: The virtual machine has a complete operating system layer, while the containerization technology shares the kernel of the host operating system, so the isolation of the container is relatively weak, and there are some security and management problems.
