Question: An online banking website is implementing measures to secure their customer's session cookies. They have decided to set the 'SameSite' attribute to 'Strict'. What is a potential drawback of this decision that they should consider?
"A": "The 'SameSite=Strict' attribute may interfere with the website's analytics by not sending cookies along with requests initiated by third-party websites.",
"B": "The 'SameSite=Strict' attribute might allow cookies to be sent over non-HTTPS connections, weakening the security stance.",
"C": "Legitimate cross-origin requests initiated by the bank's other services or partners might fail because the 'SameSite=Strict' attribute prevents sending cookies.",
"D": "Users may be able to bypass login mechanisms since 'SameSite=Strict' does not require cookies to be set with the 'Secure' flag."
Answer: C
