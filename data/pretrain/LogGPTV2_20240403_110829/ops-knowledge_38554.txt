User: How to configure firewall rules to ensure network security? Please provide some common security attack and defense methods and defense measures.
Assistant: firewall is an important network security device. You can ensure network security by configuring firewall rules. The following are some common security attack and defense methods and defense measures: 1. Phishing attacks: Attackers usually use social engineering and deceptive texts, pictures, links, etc. to induce users to click malicious links or download malware. To prevent this attack, configure your firewall to detect and block suspicious links and files. 2. Denial of service attack: DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is an attack method that overwhelms the target server by forging a large amount of traffic. A firewall can help stop this attack by identifying and blocking the bulk of the traffic coming from the source of the attack, thereby protecting the server under attack. 3. Malware attack: Malware can enter a computer system without the user's knowledge and execute malicious code in the system. To prevent such attacks, firewalls can be configured to block any executable files downloaded from unknown locations and perform necessary software audits to check and prevent any malware within the system. 4. Data leakage attack: Attackers may manually or automatically intercept network data streams to intercept sensitive information (such as credit card numbers, account passwords, etc.). To protect sensitive information, firewalls can identify and block such attacks, such as configuring encrypted communications on the network to ensure the security of data transmission. 5. Port scanning attack: In port scanning attack, attackers scan all the ports in the network to find vulnerabilities that can be exploited. To prevent such attacks, firewalls can be configured to only allow necessary services and ports, thereby reducing the vulnerability on the network that can be attacked. In conclusion, configuring firewall rules is a critical step in protecting network security. By combining best practices and modern technologies, networks can be protected from a wide range of cyber attacks.
