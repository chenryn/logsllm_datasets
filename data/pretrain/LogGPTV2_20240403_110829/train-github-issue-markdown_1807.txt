I'm not sure if this is a duplicate of #6061, But here's the problem.  
I'm on windows 10 using `deno 1.12.2 (release, x86_64-pc-windows-msvc)`, `v8
9.2.230.14`, `typescript 4.3.5`, and I have this file `DenoStd.ts` :
    import * as Http from 'https://deno.land/std@0.103.0/http/mod.ts'
    export { Http };
I'm behind a Socks5 proxy running on my localhost `127.0.0.1:1080` and I've
tried setting related environment variables to these values :
  1. `http://127.0.0.1:1080/`
  2. `https://127.0.0.1:1080/`
  3. `socks5://127.0.0.1:1080/`  
But none seem to work, and I get the following error when I reach the import
line :
    error: error sending request for url (https://deno.land/std@0.103.0/http/mod.ts): error trying to connect: tls handshake eof
        at file:///Bla/Bla/Bla/DenoStd.ts:1:0
But if I set my proxy using Windows' proxy settings GUI (instead of
environment variables) it works with no problem.
Expected behavior is that environment variables also work, so maybe there's a
bug there ? Or is it the case that Socks5 proxies are not supported somehow ??
