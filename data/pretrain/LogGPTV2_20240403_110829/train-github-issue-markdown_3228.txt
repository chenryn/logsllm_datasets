Prior to r69 SpotLight.target was being added to the scene when SpotLight or
its parent was added to it, not anymore.
Because of that changing SpotLight.target has no effect on the direction of
the light anymore. Right now as a workaround SpotLight.target should be added
to the scene manually, then light's direction will change when
SpotLight.target.position will be updated.
