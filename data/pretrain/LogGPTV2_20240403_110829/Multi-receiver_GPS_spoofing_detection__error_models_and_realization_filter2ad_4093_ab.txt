of GPS altitude. To simplify the discussion, we assume that
for our countermeasure all receivers are placed at approxi-
mately the same height. We analyze possible functions (e. g.,
minimal, maximal, or weight-based approaches) and their
eﬀects on attack detection in more detail in Appendix A.
On the basis of (2), we can deﬁne two important proba-
bilities in regard to the detection and the false alarm ratio.
The probability of detection pd describes the chance that an
actual spooﬁng attack is indeed detected. Thus, the result
of f needs to be below the threshold λ:
pd = Pr{f (di,j)  0,
x ≤ 0,

with noncentrality parameter s reﬂecting the distance to the
center and scale parameter σ as the standard deviation of the
Gaussian distribution. I0 denotes the zero-order modiﬁed
Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind.
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is deﬁned as:
F (x) =51 − Q1- s

Due to our adaptions and the addition of a second Gaus-
sian distributed point, the noncentrality parameter s and
the scale parameter σ of the resulting distribution are not
equivalent to the distance nor the standard deviation (but
are very close to the actual scales).
For the special case of two 2D-Gaussian distributed points
with the same center, s becomes 0. As a result, a Rayleigh
distribution is obtained, which is only dependent on the scale
parameter σ.
Thus, the PDF simpliﬁes as follows:
f (x) =5 x

2σ2 , x > 0,
x ≤ 0.
The corresponding Rayleigh CDF is:
F (x) =51 − e− x2
0,
2σ2 , x > 0,
x ≤ 0.

In order to evaluate the CDFs, we ﬁrst need to determine
the parameters s and σ. However, the parameter estima-
tion for both distributions is a non-trivial problem in math-
ematical analysis. Therefore, we use the numeric solution
calculated by the distribution ﬁtting function fitdist pro-
vided by MATLAB. Note that these error models are not
taking correlations into consideration. We therefore expect
distances to be more dense around the mean and that our
model is a pessimistic approximation.
4. ERROR FOR AUTHENTIC SIGNALS
In this section, we present a series of experiments we con-
ducted to obtain real-world GPS localization errors. The
experiments were executed with a set of co-located receivers,
which allows us to determine temporal and spatial correla-
tions between the localization errors. As a result, we were
able to identify suitable parameters for our spooﬁng detec-
tion mechanism.
4.1 Experimental Setup
For our experimental setup we deployed four standalone
Arduino UNOs, rev. 3. Each Arduino is extended with a
GPS logger shield including a GPS module in order to pro-
cess incoming GPS signals. Furthermore, an external active
antenna with an additional 28 dB gain is coupled with each
GPS shield. The external antenna not only provides more
stable solutions but also increases the ﬂexibility of the setup
due to an additional 5 m cable length. The combination of
these components is hereafter referred to as a receiver.
For the initial measurements, four receivers were arranged
in a cross-like formation with side lengths of approx. 4 m
to 7 m as depicted in Figure 3. Each receiver generates
NMEA 0183 data sentences from the received signals. The
data is constantly stored on a controlling laptop connected
via USB, which also powers the receivers. With a total of
four receivers, we obtain six distinct distances matching each
device with each other. For the speciﬁc relative distances we
refer to Table 2, in which dC is the distance to the center
(as measured by hand), and dRi is the calculated distance

to the other receivers. The overall formation is aligned to
the cardinal directions North, South, East, and West; it is
illustrated in the position map shown in Figure 4, which was
set up for approx. 2.5 h at a place with clear line of sight to
the sky.
4.2 Measurement Analysis
We next evaluate the recorded data and derive suitable pa-
rameters for the subsequent simulations. The position map
indicates that the reported positions are scattered around
four points, which in our case closely reﬂect the actual re-
ceiver placement. However, the deviation from the interim
positions to the actual placement can reach several meters.
Figure 5 shows the development of these distances over the
course of the experiment. While the average distance er-
ror µ ranges from approx. 0.79 m for R4 to 1.61 m for R3,
the standard deviation σ varies between approx. 0.41 m for
R4 and 0.87 m for R3. In comparison to the values reported
in Table 1, the positions measured during the experiment
are very stable.
Since our spooﬁng detection mechanism takes the relative
distances into account, we calculate the distances between
the reported positions. The results including the average
distances µ are depicted in Figure 6. The histogram uses a
bin width of 1 m. The average distances are all within 1 m
from the actual distances noted in Table 2. In Section 3.4,
we concluded that the underlying distribution is Rician. We
try to align the respective PDF from (4) with the measure-
ments. The solid (red) line represents a normalized best ﬁt
based on a Rician distribution. The gap between the theo-
retical distribution and the recorded data is mainly due to
