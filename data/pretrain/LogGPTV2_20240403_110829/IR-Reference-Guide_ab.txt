### Compromised Host Recovery Procedures for Workstations and Servers

#### Host OS and Application Rebuild Procedures
- **Rebuild Procedures**: Clearly define the steps to rebuild the host operating system (OS) and critical applications.
- **Cleaning Procedures**: Establish criteria for when cleaning a host is acceptable versus when a full rebuild is necessary. 

#### Network Segregation and Isolation
- **Search and Monitor Egress Points**: Implement procedures to search and monitor internet egress point logs for Command and Control (C2) channels.
- **Block C2 Channels**: Ensure the ability to block identified C2 channels at internet egress points.
- **Isolate High-Value Assets (HVAs)**: If feasible, isolate HVAs from other endpoints in the production environment, such as compromised workstations and servers.

**Note**: Performing password resets and blocking C2 channels alone is ineffective without detecting and removing attacker malware from hosts.

### Incident Management and Business Continuity

#### Challenges in Cybersecurity Incidents
Managing a cybersecurity incident is complex and emotionally charged, with significant potential impact on business operations. A clear business case can be made for diverting resources and time to planning and preparation. According to the recent EY Global Information Security Survey (GISS), 57% of organizations rated Business Continuity Management (BCM) as their top priority, alongside data leakage and data loss prevention.

#### Critical Preparations

1. **Adopt Incident Command System (ICS)**: For major incidents, establish a temporary command structure (or a permanent function if available). ICS, widely used in natural disasters, is highly effective.
   - **Executive Leadership Team**
     - **Incident Command Lead**
     - **Liaison Officer and Team**
     - **Welfare and Safety**
   - **Operations, Planning, Logistics, Finance & Admin Teams**

2. **Establish a Framework**: Define your incident response program and ensure it is well-documented.
3. **Exercise Your Crisis Process**: Schedule regular exercises for crisis teams and processes, including individual components and tabletop exercises involving all stakeholders.
4. **Emergency Approval Process**: Streamline the emergency approval process for rapid changes during an incident.
5. **Clear Guidelines for Escalation**: Document thresholds for escalating internal investigations to specialists and external teams based on factors like time, complexity, and specific adversaries.

#### Hallmarks of a Strong Response Program

- **Integration with Business Priorities and Leadership**
- **IT Operations**
- **Business Continuity Management and Disaster Recovery**
- **Context from Internal and External Sources**
- **Continuous Learning Culture**: Postmortems, regular exercises, and red team validations.
- **Documentation**: Detailed technical recovery instructions and high-level familiarity with the response framework.
- **Technical Readiness**: Access to proficient security and IT professionals, and expertise in operational, communications, and legal aspects.

#### Key Lessons Learned

- **Tools Alone Do Not Equal Better Security**: Tools must be accompanied by the time and skills to use them effectively.
- **Log Management**: Enabling every log source can overwhelm you with data, making it harder to find meaningful information.
- **Security Staff Roles**: Placing security staff in dual roles with IT operations can diminish their effectiveness.
- **Preparation Reduces Costs**: Properly preparing staff and scheduling resources can reduce incident costs.
- **Capture Lessons Learned**: Regularly capturing and integrating lessons learned is crucial for improving future responses.

### Organizational Preparedness Self-Assessment

#### Core Strategy and Alignment
- **High-Value Assets (HVAs)**: Understand your HVAs (processes, data, hardware, identities).
- **Enhanced Controls**: Have enhanced controls in place for HVAs and likely attack avenues.
- **High-Probability Attack Vectors**: Identify the most likely attack vectors and techniques.
- **Impact Measurement**: Measure the potential impact on processes, data, hardware, and identities.

#### Security Operations
- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: Focus on detecting and responding to cyber threats.
- **Designated Security Team**: Have a dedicated team and workflows for handling known threats.
- **Documented Processes**: Ensure incident response processes are documented, socialized, and exercised.
- **Training and Time**: Provide proper training and time for staff to investigate cyber threats.
- **Tool Effectiveness**: Evaluate the effectiveness of tools in detecting cyber threats.

### Communications

Effective communication is crucial during a security incident. Poorly managed and communicated incidents can damage brand reputation, customer trust, and employee morale, and lead to regulatory pressure and litigation.

- **Appoint a Communications Lead**: Include a communications lead in the core incident response team.
- **Develop Communications Plans**: Create a communications-centric portion of the incident response plan.
- **Map Stakeholders**: Identify and understand the obligations to inform customers, media, partners, regulators, employees, and vendors.
- **Draft Holding Statements**: Prepare draft media statements and key communications considerations for different types of incidents.
- **Tabletop Exercises**: Conduct tabletop exercises to test the incident response team's reaction to media, customer, and regulator attention.

### Legal Considerations

Legal counsel plays a critical role in proactive cybersecurity program development, deployment, and execution.

- **Designate a Cyber Lead from Legal**: Evaluate and manage legal risk, drawing from various statutes and regulations.
- **Review Policies and Public Statements**: Regularly review and update policies and public disclosures.
- **Develop an Incident Response Plan**: Create an operational document that outlines the companyâ€™s response to a security compromise or data breach.
- **Conduct Cybersecurity Assessments**: Retain cybersecurity consultants to conduct assessments and tests under legal privilege.
- **Regular Board Briefings**: Keep the board informed about cybersecurity risks and provide expert assistance.
- **Manage Third-Party Vendors**: Evaluate and negotiate agreements with third-party vendors to include security standards and legal protections.

### During an Incident

- **Stay Calm**: Prioritize the most impactful actions first.
- **Do No Harm**: Avoid decisions that could lead to data loss, loss of business-critical functionality, or loss of evidence.
- **Be Accurate**: Ensure all shared information is correct and truthful.
- **Get Help When Needed**: Leverage deep expertise and experience for sophisticated attacks.

**Critical Success Factors**:
- **Identify Scope of Attack**: Determine the extent of the attack operation.
- **Identify Attack Objectives**: Understand the objectives of persistent attackers.
- **Technology Tips**: Be cautious with uploading files to online services.

**Key Expectations to Manage**:
- **Patient Zero Identification**: It may be impossible to identify the initial point of compromise due to deleted data, rolling logs, or other factors.

By following these guidelines, organizations can better prepare for and respond to cybersecurity incidents, minimizing the impact on business operations and maintaining stakeholder trust.
