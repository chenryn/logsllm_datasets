Compromised host recovery procedures for both workstations and servers. This should include:• Host OS (and Application) rebuild procedures 
• Cleaning procedures and criteria for when to clean vs. rebuild (if “cleaning” 	a host is deemed acceptable at your organization)
Network segregation and isolation procedures including the ability to:
• Search and monitor internet egress point logs for attacker Command and 	Control (C2) channels
• Block attacker C2 channels at internet egress points• Isolate HVAs from other end points in the production environment (such as 	compromised workstations and servers), if feasible. 
We have learned that performing password resets and C2 channel 
blocking alone is ineffective without also detecting and removing 
attacker malware from hosts.

CRITICAL PREPARATIONS
Adopt Incident Command System (ICS) for Crisis Management – Major incidents represent an organizational crisis and require a temporary command structure to manage them (if you don’t already have a permanent function for this). ICS is used extensively in natural disasters and has proven itself extremely

T E A M S
Establish a Framework – Confirm that you have a framework that defines your incident response program.Exercise Your Crisis Process – Establish a recurring schedule for exercising crisis teams and processes on relevant scenarios across all responsibility levels. This schedule should include exercises of individual components as well as tabletop exercises that include all stakeholders (including legal, communications, and organizational leadership). You should also validate non-intrusive technical procedures including backup recovery and threat detection tools during these exercises.Emergency Approval Process – Confirm you have a streamlined emergency approval process for handling rapid changes during an emergency/incident (e.g., authority to judge/approve rapid change proposals and provisions to capture changes and feedback through process afterward).
Establish Clear Guidelines for Escalation – Document thresholds for when internal investigations should escalate to specialists and external investigation teams. These can be based on time spent, complexity, unknown malware, specific adversary, etc.15
HALLMARKS OF A STRONG RESPONSE PROGRAM
Because of the complexity of modern organizations, the ideal response program will vary from industry to industry and organization to organization. The general attributes of a strong incident response and recovery program are:
Strongly integrated with:
	• Business priorities and leadership
	• IT Operations
	• Business Continuity Management and Disaster Recovery• Context from internal and external sources 
Continuous learning culture and processes:
	• Postmortems performed and lessons learned integrated
	• Regular exercises and red team validation 
Documentation:
	• High level of familiarity with response framework by all stakeholders 	• Detailed technical recovery instructions (or automation) for IT and 	Security Professionals 
Technical Readiness for major incidents:• Access to technical proficiency with security systems and business 	critical systems
	• Access to experience on operational, communications, and legal 	aspects of security incidents (via internal teams and/or partnerships/ 	retainers with external organizations)
KEY LESSONS LEARNED
The stronger programs we observe have learned these key lessons:
• Just buying more tools does not equal better security.• Buying tools without having time and skills to use them 	is a waste and a distraction.
• Enabling every log source will only drown you in data, increasing 	the size of the haystack instead of finding more needles.
• Placing your security staff in a dual role with IT operations 	diminishes their effectiveness.
• You can reduce the cost of an incident by preparing your staff 	and scheduling availability of required resources.16
• Capturing lessons learned is critical to success, as you will see   the same 	attackers and techniques over and over again.

CommunicationsOf all the major costs and risks associated with managing a security incident, the potential hit to brand and reputation and loss of customer trust could be the most damaging. According to Edelman’s security study, 71% of global consumers said they would switch providers after a company they rarely used suffered a data breach. Beyond reputational impact, poorly managed and communicated security incidents can affect employee morale, as well as lead to regulatory pressure and litigation.| Americans proved most loyal to the companies they do business with, yet | Americans proved most loyal to the companies they do business with, yet | 39% | of global consumers  |

Organizations are not necessarily expected to prevent security incidents (though this depends on the nature of the risk), but they are expected to effectively manage the fallout of a cyber attack. There is a growing consensus that even organizations with highly sophisticated cyber defense systems can fall victim to an attack, and that companies should be judged by how well they manage an incident rather than if they can prevent one from occurring in the first place.Effectively communicating around security incidents requires careful planning, as well as an understanding of the unique dynamics inherent in cybersecurity issues that make them different from other types of crises. Unlike traditional crisis issues where transparency and speed are often the right course of action, there is great risk in communicating initial findings and details because the complex nature of forensics investigations make facts fluid. This dynamic leads to an increased potential to disclose information early in the response process that turns out to be incorrect later. This could lead to a loss of credibility, additional news cycles, and increased negative coverage.Below are several steps organizations should consider taking now to be prepared to handle a potential incident. 
18
PRIOR TO AN INCIDENT• Appoint a communications lead to be part of the core incident response team and confirm he or she understands the response process and cybersecurity. In the moment of a crisis, precious time and energy is spent identifying who is leading on communications and who will speak on behalf of an organization. There are unique nuances with communicating cybersecurity incidents and investigations that a strong communications lead must understand to be effective. By having him or her as part of the core team, communications and reputation management is more likely to be properly represented during the decision making process.• Develop a communications portion of existing incident response plans, including clear ownership and approval processes. Many companies have technical incident response plans that outline how to investigate and remediate an issue. What’s often missing is a communications-centric portion to manage the complex calculus of deciding what to disclose to whom and when.• Map the stakeholders that may need to receive communications regarding an incident including customers, media, partners, regulators, employees and vendors. This includes confirming the company understands its 
contractual obligations to inform certain partners or customers. Often incidents may not require disclosure to regulators or consumers, but they still need to be shared with enterprise customers in a timely manner. Understanding these obligations ahead of an incident can save valuable time during a live incident.• Develop draftmedia holding statements and other materials for the major types of incidents that are of most concern to your company. These statements are intended to be used with the press during the early stages of an investigation when many of the details of the issue are still unknown. It’s also important to develop key communications considerations for each of the incidents, which can help guide decision-making when an incident occurs. For example, if and under what circumstances the company would pay to remove ransomware and how would they position this decision to key stakeholders.• Host a table top exercise with members from the entire incident response team to test how they would react to the media, customer, and regulator attention due to an incident. These tabletops are often best done in conjunction with outside legal counsel (in order to protect the content under attorney client privilege) and are intended to focus on more than the non-technical aspects of incident response.19
Legal
Legal counsel increasingly plays a critical role in proactive cybersecurity program development, deployment, and execution. As with any compliance regime, cybersecurity lawyers provide legal advice regarding statutory, contractual, and regulatory duties, as well as recommendations on managing and mitigating legal risk that may result from audits, investigations, or litigation. Experienced regulators now expect that organizations will prepare for an incident and will evaluate their regulatory enforcement decisions through that lens.The following are some of the key aspects of proactive legal work flows in cybersecurity:• Designate a Cyber Lead from Legal. Much of cybersecurity incident response preparation involves evaluating and managing legal risk. With no overarching cybersecurity law, counsel should draw from a patchwork of statutes (e.g., state notification statues), regulations, government enforcement proceedings, settlements, and guidance, and litigation trends to assess risk. Legal counsel (internal and/or external) should also be positioned to “direct” certain incident response preparation activities and to retain outside forensic and communications experts to maximize the likelihood that their proactive and reactive work is covered by the attorney-client privilege.• Review Policies and Public Statements. If you say you do it, you’d better do it. That goes not only for public representations (e.g., privacy statements, service representations), but also internal security policies. 
These policies and public disclosures should be regularly reviewed to represent the current state, and avoid unnecessarily grand or definitive statements about a company’s cybersecurity program (e.g., “we have bank-level security” or “we have state-of-the-art cybersecurity”).• Develop an Incident Response Plan. The Incident Response Plan is the key operational document that pulls together different aspects of a company’s response to a security compromise or data breach. Regulators and plaintiffs focus on not only the technical security measures in place, but also the speed, efficiency, and effectiveness of the company’s response when facing a cyber attack. Expert cyber counsel craft operationally effective processes that reflect the latest insights from regulators and litigated cases with an eye toward building a narrative of diligence while avoiding inadvertent admissions of liability or creating ad hoc standards that are neitherreasonable nor attainable. 
20• Conduct Cybersecurity Assessments and Tests at Legal’s Direction. Results from these assessments are among the first requests by regulators and plaintiffs. Because organizations often cannot implement all of the recommendations that arise out these assessments, teams must make risk-based judgments around remediation and mitigation efforts. Legal counsel (inside or outside) should retain cybersecurity consultants to conduct penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, etc., and scope and direct their work in very close collaboration with IT Security, thus protecting related communications, work product, and deliberations under legal privilege. Reports should be prepared sparingly, and only at the direction of counsel to minimize discovery risks.• Conduct Regular Board Briefings. Directors cannot fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities if they are not aware of the risks. Accordingly, boards should be regularly briefed on cybersecurity risks, and provided with sufficient information and expert assistance in understanding and assessing cybersecurity risk, so that they can effectively manage cybersecurity risk.• Manage Third Party Vendors. Third parties with access to the corporate network or personal data about customers/employees expand the attack surface and often represent the “weakest link.” During the diligence phase, vendors should be evaluated based on the risks that they present. 
Agreements should be negotiated to include security standards that vendors must comply with; a clear process on how vendors will investigate, cooperate, and notify affective individuals; and legal protections(indemnification, limitation of liability, insurance, etc.) for when an incident takes place. Finally, organizations should develop an audit, review or certification process to test vendors’ compliance with security standards.

DURING AN INCIDENT, IT IS CRITICAL TO:DURING AN INCIDENT, IT IS CRITICAL TO:
• Keep calm – Incidents are extremely disruptive and can become emotionally charged. Stay calm and focus on prioritizing your efforts on the most impactful actions first. 
• Do no harm – Confirm your response is designed and executed in a way that avoids loss of data, loss of business critical functionality, and loss of evidence. Avoid decisions can damage your ability to create forensic timelines, identify root cause, and learn critical lessons.• Be Accurate – Confirm anything you share to the public and to customers 	is correct and truthful. 
• Get help when needed – Investigating and responding to attacks from sophisticated attackers benefits significantly from deep expertise and experience.
Like diagnosing and treating medical disease, cybersecurity investigation and response for a major incident requires defending a system that is both:• Critically important (can’t be shut down to work on it) 
• Complex (typically beyond comprehension of any one person)
 During an incident, you must strike several critical balances 
Speed: You must balance the need to act quickly to satisfy stakeholders with the risk of rushed decisions.
Sharing information: You must inform investigators, stakeholders, and customers while limiting liability and unrealistic expectations.This section is designed to lower risk to your business in an incident by 
identifying common errors to avoid and providing guidance on what actions you can take rapidly that both reduce risk and meet stakeholder needs. 
23
Technology – Investigation Phase CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
• Must Identify Scope of attack operation – Most adversaries use multiple persistence mechanisms.• Identify Objective of attack, if 
possible, as persistent attackers will frequently return for their objective (data/systems) in a future attack.
TIPS
• Don’t upload files to online
