**Question:**
Does anyone know where or how to set the default save path/directory for Python scripts before running them? On a Mac, it defaults to saving in the top-level `~/Documents` directory. I would like to specify a different location. Any suggestions?

**Answer:**
If you are using Windows 7, you can set the default save directory for Python scripts by following these steps:

1. Click on the **Start** menu and locate **IDLE (Python 3.6 32-bit)**.
2. Right-click on the IDLE shortcut and select **Properties**.
3. In the **Shortcut** tab, find the **Start in** field.
4. Enter the desired path in the **Start in** field. For example, if you want to save your scripts in `C:\MyPythonScripts`, enter that path.
5. Click **OK** to apply the changes.

Please note that if IDLE is open and running while you make these changes, you will need to close and restart IDLE for the new default save directory to take effect.

For Mac users, the process is slightly different. You can set the default save directory in IDLE by modifying the `idlelib/config-main.def` file, which is typically located in the Python installation directory. Here’s how:

1. Locate the `idlelib` folder within your Python installation directory. This is usually found at `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x/lib/python3.x/idlelib/`.
2. Open the `config-main.def` file in a text editor.
3. Look for the line that starts with `default_path =`. If it doesn’t exist, you can add it.
4. Set `default_path` to your desired directory. For example:
   ```python
   default_path = '~/MyPythonScripts'
   ```
5. Save the file and restart IDLE for the changes to take effect.

By following these steps, you should be able to set a custom default save directory for your Python scripts.
