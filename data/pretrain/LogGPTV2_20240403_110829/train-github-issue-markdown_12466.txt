Hi all,
I added six -to seven carousel slides on my page, and from back-end I am
setting some div (item) style to display none. This code will only hiding the
div contain but actual div is not removed from the slide show . (so if i set
style="display:none" in slide show it is showing empty slide.
Regards,
