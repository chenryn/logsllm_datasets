Hi All,

I have added six to seven carousel slides to my webpage. From the back-end, I am setting the style of certain `div` elements (items) to `display: none`. While this code hides the content within these `div` elements, it does not remove the `div` itself from the slideshow. As a result, if I set `style="display:none"` for a slide, it still appears as an empty slide in the carousel.

Regards,
