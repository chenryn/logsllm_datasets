Having votes on a signle request does not appear to be effective, so maybe if
in stead of voting on an exisisting one we create hundreds of code folding
requests will they add it?
been wanting to use VS Code for months now, and it's frustrating to have
complicated features like extenstions added, but something simple like code
folding is left.
Gonna give up on VS Code in a month :(
