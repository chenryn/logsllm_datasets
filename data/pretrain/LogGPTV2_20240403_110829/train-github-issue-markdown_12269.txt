It seems that voting on a single request for a feature has not been effective. Perhaps creating multiple requests for code folding might increase the likelihood of it being added. I have been wanting to use Visual Studio Code for months, and it is frustrating to see complex features such as extensions being implemented, while a basic feature like code folding is still missing. If this issue is not resolved, I may have to give up on using VS Code within the next month.
