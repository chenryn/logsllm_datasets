**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
I want to request a _feature_.
**What is the current behavior?**
  * Warning code is hardcoded to call `fbjs/lib/warning`. This makes it hard to integrate warnings with tools.
  * As a workaround we could use webpackâ€™s `resolve.alias` to alias `fbjs/lib/warning` into our fork which displays it on-screen.
    * This use case is similar to #7360.
  * Another use case is to integrate React warnings with our testing infrastructure. This helps us to better see which warning belongs to which test.

**What is the expected behavior?**
  * React allows library user to override the default warnings behavior.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
  * The workaround works in React 15 and should still work in React 16, as the flat bundles does `var warning = require('fbjs/lib/warning')` which means we can still hook into it for now.
  * This probably breaks when the flat bundles stopped doing `var warning = require('fbjs/lib/warning')`.
