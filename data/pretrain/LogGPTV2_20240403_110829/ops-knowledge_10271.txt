User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Web Designer Permissions on a Production Web Server Just started working with a small group of front-end web developers who all login to the dedicated WHM/Apache production server with root to modify client web sites. They claim they do not want to have to log into each of the individual site accounts because there are so many.

I'm not an experienced sysadmin but I know this is wrong.

What is the best way to create logins for these developers and assign permissions to have full rwx privileges to all client assets in the /home/ directories?

Additional Information: 
* When I say developers I mean CSS/HTML front-end designers. Our developers use git as a CVS and do not work on the server until we push new versions of the CMS.

Actually, what's really wrong is that there are developers on your production machines. :-/
(Your life will be better when you have another machine for them to test their changes on and a scripted way to get those changes to the production setup.  Your life will really get better when they're checking their code into a central source code repository (svn or the like) and deploying it to a staging environment for testing, and only then to to production.)

Unfortunately, I'm not sure I can provide much constructive advice without knowing more details about your situation, but here are a few things that may help:


Set up sudo to allow your developers to do things as the individual clients
Use group-writable modes on the directories in question
