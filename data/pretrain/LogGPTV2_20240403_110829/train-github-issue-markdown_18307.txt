Hi guys, thanks for such a wonderful library. I want a special type of image
transformation.
This custom transformation should scale the image down maintaining the
original aspect ratio so that one dimension of the image is exactly equal to
the target dimensions and the other dimension of the image is greater than the
target dimensions.
Can I achieve this effect using `CENTER_CROP` or should I write custom
transformation? Please help me out.
If I need to write custom transformation, please help me writing it.
