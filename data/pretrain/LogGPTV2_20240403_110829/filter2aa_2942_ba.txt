SCENARIO 3: Industrial Espionage 
Background 
ABC Company, a semiconductor (SC) company used by the enterprise to produce military and 
aerospace systems, is considering a partnership with a KXY Co. to leverage their fabrication 
facility. This would represent a significant change in the supply chain related to a critical system 
element. A committee was formed – including representatives from the enterprise, ABC 
Company, and the integration company – to help identify the impacts that the partnership would 
have on the enterprise and risk-appropriate mitigation practices to enact when the partnership is 
completed. 
Environment 
The systems of concern are vital to the safety of military and aerospace missions. While not 
classified, the element that KXY would be expected to manufacture is unique, patented, and 
critical to the operational status of the systems. The loss of availability of the element while the 
system is operational could have significant, immediate impacts across multiple agencies and the 
civilian populous, including the loss of life and millions of dollars in damages. An initial risk 
assessment was conducted using [NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1], and the existing level of risk for this 
was given a score of “Moderate.” 
KXY currently produces a state-of-the-art, low-cost wafer fabrication with a primarily 
commercial focus. The nation-state in which KXY operates has a history of conducting industrial 
espionage to gain IP/technology. They have shown interest in semiconductor technology and 
provided a significant grant to KXY to expand into the military and aerospace markets. While 
KXY does not currently have the testing infrastructure to meet U.S. industry compliance 
requirements, the nation-state’s resources are significant and include the ability to provide both 
concessions and incentives to help KXY meet those requirements. The key area of concern is 
that the nation-state in which KXY operates would be able to use its influence to gain access to 
the element or the element’s design. 
The committee reviewed the current mitigation strategies in place and determined that ABC 
Company, the integration company, and the enterprise had several existing practices to ensure 
that the system and all critical elements – as determined by a criticality analysis – met specific 
functionality requirements. For example, the system and critical elements are determined to be 
compliant with relevant industry standards. As part of their requirements under [NIST SP 800-
53, Rev. 5], the agency had some information protection requirements (Ref. PM-11). In addition, 
ABC Company had a sophisticated inventory tracking system that required that most elements be 
uniquely tagged using RFID technology or otherwise identified for traceability (Ref. SR-4).  
Threat Scenario 
Based on past experience, the enterprise decided that KXY’s host nation would likely perform 
one of two actions if given access to the technology: 1) sell it to interested parties or 2) insert or 
identify vulnerabilities for later exploitation. For either of these threat events to succeed, the host

PRACTICES FOR SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS

nation would have to understand the purpose of the element and be given significant access to 
the element or element’s design. This could be accomplished with the cooperation of KXY’s 
human resources department, through deception, or by physical or electronic theft. Physical theft 
would be difficult given existing physical control requirements and inventory control procedures. 
For a modified element to be purchased and integrated with the system, it would need to pass 
various testing procedures at both the integrator and agency levels. Testing methods currently 
utilized include radiographic examination, material analysis, electrical testing, and sample 
accelerated life testing. Modifications to identification labels or schemes would need to be 
undetectable in a basic examination. In addition, KXY would need to pass routine audits, which 
would check KXY’s processes for ensuring the quality and functionality of the element. 
The committee decided that, despite existing practices, there was a 30 % chance that the host 
nation would have the motivation and ability to develop harmful modifications to the element 
without detection, exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities, or provide the means for one of 
their allies to do the same. This could result in a loss of availability or integrity of the system, 
causing significant harm. Using information from an initial risk assessment accomplished using 
[NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1], the committee identified this as the worst-case scenario with an 
impact score of “High.”   
There is an approximately 40 % chance that the host nation could and would sell the technology 
to interested parties, resulting in a loss of technological superiority. If this scenario occurred, 
friendly military and civilian lives could be at risk, intelligence operations would be damaged, 
and more money would be required to invest in a new solution. The committee assigned an 
impact score for this scenario of “Moderate.” 
The committee determined that the overall combined risk exposure for the vulnerability of 
concern was “High.” 
Mitigating Strategies 
Using Appendix A of NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1 as a base, three broad strategies were identified 
by the committee: (1) improve traceability capabilities, (2) increase provenance and information 
requirements, and (3) choose another supplier. These three options were analyzed in more detail 
to determine specific implementation strategies, their impact on the scenarios, and their 
estimated cost to implement. (Specific technologies and techniques are not described in this case 
but would be useful in an actual threat scenario evaluation.) 
Improve traceability and monitoring capabilities: 
• CM-8 – SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY 
• IA-1 – POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
• SA-10 – DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT 
• SR-8 – NOTIFICATION AGREEMENTS 
• SR-4 – PROVENANCE 
Cost = 20 % increase

Impact = 10 % decrease 
Increase provenance and information control requirements: 
• AC-21 – INFORMATION SHARING 
• SR-4 – PROVENANCE 
Cost = 20 % increase 
Impact = 20 % decrease 
Choose another supplier:  
• SR-6 – SUPPLIER ASSESSMENTS AND REVIEWS 
Cost = 40 % increase 
Impact = 80 % decrease 
Based on this analysis, the committee decided to implement a combination of practices:  
• Develop and require unique, difficult-to-copy labels or alter labels to discourage cloning 
or modification of the component [Ref. SR-3(2)].  
• Minimize the amount of information that is shared with suppliers. Require that the 
information be secured [Ref. AC-21].  
• Require that provenance be kept and updated throughout the SDLC [Ref. SR-4]. 
With this combination of controls, the estimated residual risk was determined to be equivalent to 
the existing risk without the partnership at a cost increase that is less than if the enterprise had 
changed suppliers.

SCENARIO 4: Malicious Code Insertion 
Background  
ABC Company has decided to perform a threat scenario analysis on a traffic control system. The 
scenario is to focus on software vulnerabilities and should provide general recommendations 
regarding mitigating practices.  
Environment 
The system runs nearly automatically and uses computers that run a commonly available 
operating system along with centralized servers. The software was created in-house and is 
regularly maintained and updated by an integration company on contract for the next five years. 
The integration company is large, frequently used by ABC Company in a variety of projects, and 
has significant resources to ensure that the system maintains its high availability and integrity 
requirements.  
Threats to the system could include the loss of power to the system, loss of functionality, or loss 
of integrity causing incorrect commands to be processed. Some threat sources could include 
nature, malicious outsiders, and malicious insiders. The system is equipped with certain safety 
controls, such as backup generator power, redundancy of design, and contingency plans if the 
system fails.  
Threat Event 
ABC Company decided that the most concerning threat event would result from a malicious 
insider compromising the integrity of the system. Possible attacks could include the threat actor 
inserting a worm or a virus into the system, reducing its ability to function, or they could 
manually control the system from one of the central servers or by creating a back door in the 
server to be accessed remotely. Depending on the skillfulness of the attack, an insider could gain 
control of the system, override certain fail-safes, and cause significant damage. 
Based on this information, ABC Company developed the following fictitious threat event for 
analysis: 
John Poindexter, a disgruntled employee of the integration company, decides to insert 
some open source malware into a component of the system. He then resigns from the 
firm, leaving no trace of his work. The malware has the ability to call home to John and 
provide him access to stop or allow network traffic at any or all 50 of the transportation 
stations. As a result, unpredictable, difficult-to-diagnose disruptions would occur, 
causing significant monetary losses and safety concerns. 
After a risk assessment was conducted using [NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1], management decided 
that the acceptable level of risk for this scenario was “Moderate.”

CYBERSECURITY SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT 
PRACTICES FOR SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS 
186 
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1 
Threat Scenario Analysis 
If John were successful, a potential course of events could occur as follows: 
John conducts a trial run, shutting off the services of one station for a short time. It would 
be discounted as a fluke and have minimal impact. Later, John would create increasingly 
frequent disruptions at various stations. These disruptions would cause anger among 
employees and customers, as well as some safety concerns. The integration company 
would be made aware of the problem and begin to investigate the cause. They would 
create a workaround and assume that there was a bug in the system. However, because 
the malicious code would be buried and difficult to identify, the integration company 
would not discover it. John would then create a major disruption across several 
transportation systems at once. The workaround created by the integration company 
would fail due to the size of the attack, and all transportation services would be halted. 
Travelers would be severely impacted and the media alerted. The method of attack would 
be identified and the system modified to prevent John from accessing the system again. 
However, the underlying malicious code would remain. Revenue would decrease 
significantly for several months. Legal questions would arise. Resources would be 
invested in assuring the public that the system was safe.  
Mitigating Practices 
ABC Company identified the following potential areas for improvement:  
• Establish and retain identification of supply chain elements, processes, and actors [SR-4].  
• Control access and configuration changes within the SDLC, and require periodic code 
reviews (e.g., manual peer-review) [AC-1, AC-2, CM-3].  
• Require static code testing [RA-9].  
• Establish incident handling procedures [IR-4].
