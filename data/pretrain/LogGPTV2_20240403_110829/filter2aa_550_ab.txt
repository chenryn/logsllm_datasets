Cyber Security and National Security
... Allied air power was decisive in the war in Western Europe ... In the air, its victory 
was complete. At sea, its contribution ... brought an end to the enemy’s greatest naval 
threat – the U-boat; on land, it helped turn the tide overwhelmingly in favor of Allied 
ground forces.11
Cyber attacks are unlikely to have the lethality of a strategic bomber, at least for 
the foreseeable future. But in the end, the success of military operations is effects-
based. If both a ballistic missile and a computer worm can destroy or disable a 
target, the natural choice will be the worm.
In May 2009, President Obama made a dramatic announcement: “Cyber intruders 
have probed our electrical grid ... in other countries, cyber attacks have plunged 
entire cities into darkness.”12 Investigative journalists subsequently concluded that 
these attacks took place in Brazil, affecting millions of civilians in 2005 and 2007, 
and that the source of the attacks is still unknown.13 National security planners 
should consider that electricity has no substitute, and all other infrastructures, in-
cluding computer networks, depend on it.14
In 2010, the Stuxnet computer worm may have accomplished what five years of 
United Nations Security Council resolutions could not: disrupt Iran’s pursuit of a 
nuclear bomb.15 If true, a half-megabyte of computer code quietly substituted for 
air strikes by the Israeli Air Force. Moreover, Stuxnet may have been more effective 
than a conventional military attack and may have avoided a major international cri-
sis over collateral damage. To some degree, the vulnerability of the Internet to such 
spectacular attacks will provide a strong temptation for nation-states to take advan-
tage of computer hacking’s perceived high return-on-investment before it goes away.
If cyber attacks play a lead role in future wars, and the fight is largely over owner-
ship of IT infrastructure, it is possible that international conflicts will be shorter and 
cost fewer lives. A cyber-only victory could facilitate post-war diplomacy, economic 
recovery, and reconciliation. Such a war would please history’s most famous mili-
tary strategist, Sun Tzu, who argued that the best leaders can attain victory before 
combat is necessary.16
It may be unlikely, however, that an example like Stuxnet will occur frequently. Mod-
ern critical infrastructures present complex, diverse, and distributed targets. They

INTRODUCTION
comprise not one system, technology, or procedure, but many and are designed 
to survive human failings and even natural disasters. Engineers on-site may see 
the start of an attack and neutralize it before it becomes a serious threat. In short, 
computer vulnerabilities should not be confused with vulnerabilities in whole infra-
structures.17
Cyber attacks may rise to the level of a national security threat only when an adver-
sary has invested a significant amount of time and effort into a creative and well-
timed strike on a critical infrastructure target such as an electrical grid, financial 
system, air traffic control, etc.
Air defense is an example of a system that plays a strategic role in national security 
and international relations. It may also represent a particular cyber vulnerability 
in the context of a traditional military attack. In 2007, for example, it was reported 
that a cyber attack preceded the Israeli air force’s destruction of an alleged Syrian 
nuclear reactor.18
Military leaders, by virtue of their profession, should expect to receive Denial of Ser-
vice (DoS) attacks against their network infrastructure. As early as the 1999 Kosovo 
war, unknown hackers attempted to disrupt NATO military operations via the Inter-
net and claimed minor victories.19 In future conflicts, DoS attacks may encompass 
common network “flooding” techniques, the physical destruction of computer hard-
ware, the use of electromagnetic interference,20 and more.
Terrorists do not possess the unqualified nation-state backing that militaries enjoy. 
As a consequence, they may still believe that the Internet poses more of a danger 
than an opportunity.
Forensic examination of captured hard drives proves that terrorists have studied 
computer hacking,21 and Western economies are a logical target. For example, ten-
sion in the Middle East is now always accompanied by cyber attacks. During the 
2006 war between Israel and Gaza, pro-Palestinian hackers successfully denied ser-
vice to around 700 Israeli Internet domains.22
But a long-term, economic threat from cyber terrorists may be illogical. In a global-
ized, interconnected world, a cooperative nation-state would only seem to be hurt-
ing itself, and a terrorist group may crave a higher level of shock and media atten-

tion than a cyber attack could create.23 Former U.S. Director of National Intelligence 
(DNI) Mike McConnell has argued that a possible exception could be a cyber attack 
on the public’s confidence in the financial system itself, specifically in the security 
and supply of money.24
All things considered, cyber attacks appear capable of having strategic consequenc-
es; therefore, they must be taken seriously by national security leadership. At the 
national and organizational levels, a good starting point is methodical risk manage-
ment, including objective threat evaluation and careful resource allocation. The goal 
is not perfection, but the application of due diligence and common sense.
The pertinent questions include:
• What is our critical infrastructure?
• Is it dependent on information technology?
• Is it connected to the Internet?
• Would its loss constitute a national security threat?
• Can we secure it or, failing that, take it off-line?
Objectivity is key. Cyber attacks receive enormous media hype, in part because they 
involve the use of arcane tools and tactics that can be difficult to understand for 
those without a formal education in computer science or information technology.
As dependence on IT and the Internet grow, governments should make proportional 
investments in network security, incident response, technical training, and interna-
tional collaboration.
However, because cyber security has evolved from a technical discipline to a strate-
gic concept, and because cyber attacks can affect national security at the strategic 
level, world leaders must look beyond the tactical arena. The quest for strategic 
cyber security involves marshaling all of the resources of a nation-state.
Therefore, the goal of this research is to evaluate nation-state cyber attack mitiga-
tion strategies. To support its arguments and conclusions, the author employs the 
Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL).

Lewis, 2010. CSIS’s Lewis recently stated: “It remains intriguing and suggestive that [terrorists] have 
not launched a cyber attack. This may reflect a lack of capability, a decision that cyber weapons do 
not produce the violent results terrorists crave, or a preoccupation with other activities. Eventually 
terrorists will use cyber attacks, as they become easier to launch...”

INTRODUCTION
The Nature and Scope of this Book
Today, world leaders fear that cyber terrorism and cyber warfare pose a new and 
perhaps serious threat to national security – the Internet is a powerful resource, 
modern society is increasingly dependent upon it, and cyber attackers have demon-
strated the capability to manipulate and disrupt the Internet for a wide variety of 
political and military purposes.
There is a clear need for national security planners to prepare cyber defenses at 
both the tactical and strategic levels. The goal of this research is to help decision 
makers with the latter – to choose the most efficient courses of action to take at the 
strategic level in order to defend their national interests in cyberspace.
Beyond its Introduction and Conclusion, this book has three primary parts. First, it 
explores the changing nature of cyber security, tracing its evolution from a technical 
discipline to a strategic concept. Second, it evaluates four approaches to improving 
the cyber security posture of a nation-state – Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), 
the application of Sun Tzu’s Art of War to cyber conflict, cyber attack deterrence, 
and cyber arms control. Third, it employs the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation 
Laboratory (DEMATEL) to analyze the key concepts covered and to prioritize the 
four cyber security strategies.
The four cyber attack mitigation strategies – IPv6, Art of War, deterrence and arms 
control – fall into several categories. IPv6 is a technical solution. Art of War is mili-
tary. The third and fourth strategies are hybrid: deterrence is a mix of military and 
political considerations; arms control is a political/technical approach.
There are significant limitations to this research. Cyberspace is complex, dynamic, 
and constantly evolving. National security planning involves a wide array of fallible 
human perceptions and at times irrational decision-making at both the national 
and international levels. At a minimum, strategic cyber security demands a holistic 
investigation, subject to the particular context of different nations. These complexi-
ties serve to limit the aspiration of this research to an initial policy evaluation that 
addresses the needs of a theoretical nation-state.
Data collection for this research consisted primarily of peer-reviewed scientific lit-
erature and the author’s direct observation of events such as the 2010 Cooperative 
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence/Swedish National Defence College cyber defense 
exercise (CDX), “Baltic Cyber Shield.” Data analysis is almost exclusively that of the 
author,25 whose personal experience as a cyber security analyst spans over a decade.

The validation of this research rests on peer-review, to which every chapter has 
been subjected. It encompasses fourteen articles related to strategic cyber security, 
eleven written solely by the author, six of which are listed in the Thomson Reuters 
ISI Web of Knowledge.
The author is ideally placed to conduct this research. Since 2007, he has been a Sci-
entist at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Cooperative Cyber Defence 
Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia.26 Previously, he was the Division Chief for 
Cyber Analysis at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) in Washington, 
DC.

CYBER SECURITY
2. CYBER SECURITY: A SHORT HISTORY
Human history is often marked by revolutions in science and technology. During the 
Industrial Revolution, for example, the steam engine worked miracles for our mus-
cles. Standardization and mass production dramatically lowered the cost of manu-
factured goods by decreasing the amount of human energy required to make them.
We are now in the middle of the Information Revolution. The computer is in effect a 
steam engine for our brains. It dramatically facilitates the acquisition and validation 
of knowledge. The primary goal of building the first computers was simple – to cre-
ate a machine that could process calculations faster than a human could by hand. In 
due course, scientists were able to accomplish that and much, much more.
Chapter 2 of this book outlines the primary historical events that have transformed 
cyber security from a technical discipline to a strategic concept.
The Power of Computers
In 1837, Cambridge University Professor Charles Babbage designed the “Analytical 
Engine,” a surprisingly modern mechanical computer that was never built because it 
was about 100 years ahead of its time.
Historically, national security considerations have been the prevailing wind behind 
the development of Information Technology (IT).27 In 1943, the U.S. military com-
missioned the world’s first general-purpose electronic computer, the Electronic Nu-
merical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC). This collection of 18,000 vacuum tubes 
was designed to compute ballistic trajectories at 100,000 “pulses” per second, or 
100 times faster than a human with a mechanical calculator. ENIAC smashed all 
expectations, calculating at speeds up to 300,000 times faster than a human.
After WWII, cutting-edge computers began to demonstrate their value outside the 
military realm. UNIVAC I,28 the first commercial computer produced in the United

Commercially, companies such as International Business Machines (IBM) had found success in 
marketing electro-mechanical devices by 1900.

The Universal Automatic Computer I had a clock speed of 2.5 MHz, a central memory of 1,000 91-bit 
words, and a peak rate of 1,000 FLOPS, or about 1/1,000,000th the speed of a CRAY-2.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
States, correctly predicted the results of the 1952 Presidential election based on a 
sample of just 1%.
But the Information Revolution had only just begun. The arrival of the personal com-
puter (PC) left a much deeper impact on the Earth. The invention of the microproces-
sor, random-access storage, and software of infinite variety allowed anyone to own 
a “personal mainframe” with demonstrable scientific and engineering capabilities.29
Information Technology (IT) now pervades our lives. In 1965, Gordon Moore cor-
rectly predicted that the number of transistors on a computer chip would double 
every two years.30 There has been similar growth in almost all aspects of informa-
tion technology (IT), including the availability of practical encryption, user-friendly
