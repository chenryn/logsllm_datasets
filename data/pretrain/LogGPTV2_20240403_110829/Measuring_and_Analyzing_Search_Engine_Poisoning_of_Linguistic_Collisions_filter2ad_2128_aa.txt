Abstract—Misspelled keywords have become an appealing
target in search poisoning, since they are less competitive to
promote than the correct queries and account for a consid-
erable amount of search trafﬁc. Search engines have adopted
several countermeasure strategies, e.g., Google applies automated
corrections on queried keywords and returns search results of
the corrected versions directly. However, a sophisticated class
of attack, which we term as linguistic-collision misspelling, can
evade auto-correction and poison search results. Cybercriminals
target special queries where the misspelled terms are existent
words, even in other languages (e.g., “idobe”, a misspelling of
the English word “adobe”, is a legitimate word in the Nigerian
language).
In this paper, we perform the ﬁrst large-scale analysis on
linguistic-collision search poisoning attacks. In particular, we
check 1.77 million misspelled search terms on Google and Baidu
and analyze both English and Chinese languages, which are
the top two languages used by Internet users [1]. We leverage
edit distance operations and linguistic properties to generate
misspelling candidates. To more efﬁciently identify linguistic-
collision search terms, we design a deep learning model that can
improve collection rate by 2.84x compared to random sampling.
Our results show that the abuse is prevalent: around 1.19% of
linguistic-collision search terms on Google and Baidu have results
on the ﬁrst page directing to malicious websites. We also ﬁnd that
cybercriminals mainly target categories of gambling, drugs, and
adult content. Mobile-device users disproportionately search for
misspelled keywords, presumably due to small screen for input.
Our work highlights this new class of search engine poisoning
and provides insights to help mitigate the threat.
I. INTRODUCTION
Search engines serve an important role in people’s daily lives
and drive the majority of web trafﬁc. Indeed, 50%–70% of the
trafﬁc to websites come through search engines [2]. Website
developers and administrators go to great lengths to improve
the rankings of their pages by following benign search engine
optimization (SEO) guides [3]. On the other hand, cybercriminals
attempt to use search engine poisoning techniques (such as
keyword stufﬁng [4] and link farms [5]) to poison popular
search keywords, falsely promote rankings, and divert users to
their websites for malicious purposes. Such abuses not only
deteriorate users’ experience to navigate web content, but also
cause substantial loss of visitors and revenue from legitimate
businesses.
Misspelled keywords have increasingly become the target
in SEO attacks [6], since they are less competitive to poison
compared to the correct popular queries and can capture large
numbers of users who accidentally make typographical errors.
To combat the hassle of abusing misspelled keywords, search
engines, including Google and Baidu, have taken multiple
actions, ranging from displaying warning messages to bring
users’ attention when there are potential misspellings in the
search queries, to automatically returning search results of the
correct versions. As shown in Figure 1(a), suppose a user makes a
misspelled search for adoeb on Google (misspelling of adobe).
The search is automatically changed to adobe (the correct
search term) and the user will not receive any search result for
the misspelled input. However, adversaries crave to continue
preying on the misspelled query trafﬁc that users generate. Even
large vendors attempt to leverage misspelled keywords. For
example, Amazon used misspellings to advertise products on
their website [7], and Snickers targeted misspelled keywords
in the “You are Not You When You’re Hungry” advertisement
campaign [8]. The rapid adoption of mobile devices, such as
smart phones and tablets, exacerbates chances of incorrect inputs,
presumably due to typing on small screens. A recent report
shows that around 60% of search queries are attributed to mobile
devices [9].
To bypass automated corrections of search engines, attackers
can employ a new attack scheme, namely linguistic-collision
misspelling, which abuses the mistyped search queries coinciding
with legitimate existent words, even in a different language. For
example, “idobe” is a misspelling of the English word “adobe”,
but also happens to be an existent Nigerian word (meaning
“dropping”); “平锅” in Chinese (meaning “frying pan”) is a
mistake input of “苹果” (meaning “Apple” company). Search
engines do not enforce automated corrections on such cases,
which introduces exploitation opportunities for cybercriminals
to launch search engine poisoning attacks.
In this work, we perform the ﬁrst large-scale analysis of
linguistic-collision search engine poisoning. We focus on both
English and Chinese languages, which are the top two languages
used by Internet users [1]. We collect target keywords from
a variety of categories, such as drugs, gambling, clothing,
and food. We also include Alexa top 10,000 names in the
English target-keyword corpus. Two main challenges that
we face are: (1) how to generate misspelled words, and
(2) how to effectively determine whether a particular search
term will be auto-corrected/suggested by search engines. For
English-word analysis, we ﬁrst use edit distances to generate
potential misspelling candidates. To make the experiment scale
(particularly for Alexa top 10,000 names), we adapt a deep
learning model–the Recurrent Neural Network framework–
to predict how likely a misspelling candidate will not be

(a) Showing-results-for case (high conﬁdence about
misspellings), where the returned search results are
automatically changed for the corrected search term
adobe. Users do not receive search results for the
misspelled keyword.
(b) Including-results-for case (medium conﬁdence
about misspellings), where the top returned results
are changed for the corrected search term adobe
and the rest of the results are for the originally input

spellings), where the returned search results are for the

automatically corrected. Our approach can improve the collection
rate by 2.84 times compared to random sampling. For Chinese-
word analysis, we use a phonetic approach (pinyin input)
to convert Chinese characters to Roman letters and generate
misspelling candidates. To reduce online checking, we compare
the candidate words against Chinese word dictionaries, since a
misspelled Chinese word must still be another valid Chinese
word. Finally, we crawl search results showing on the ﬁrst
page from Google and Baidu, and check whether the URLs are
blacklisted.
In this work, we have the following key ﬁndings.
• We ﬁnd that linguistic-collision misspellings are widely
abused by attackers with 1.19% of non-auto-corrected
terms returning malicious results on the ﬁrst page from
both Google and Baidu.
• Cybercriminals primarily target keywords related to drugs,
gambling, and adult terms, with searches poisoned at four
times the rate of less easily monetized categories (like
clothing or food).
• Poisoning activity exhibits a long-tail effect with search
results across the Alexa top 10,000 dataset containing
around 0.54% poisoning rate on the ﬁrst page.
• Among various misspelling generation methods, vowel
substitution for English produces a 50% higher non-auto-
corrected rate compared to average, and the Chinese
methods yield a 2.4x improvement for same pronunciation
and 2.3x for fuzzy pinyin.
• According to the trafﬁc comparison from Google Adwords
and Baidu Index, mobile-device users provide a signiﬁcant
proportion of the trafﬁc to linguistic-collision misspellings
presumably through fat-ﬁnger errors. The increase in trafﬁc
further incentivizes attackers to target this class of search
engine poisoning.
To summarize, we make the following contributions in this
paper.
• We systematically measure and understand a new threat—
linguistic-collision misspellings, which allows attackers
to bypass existing auto-correction tools and poison large
numbers of search results.
• We design a novel approach using deep learning to collect
linguistic-collision misspellings in the wild. Based on our
experiment on the Alexa top 10,000 case, we ﬁnd that our
model outperforms random sampling by 2.84x.
• Using our crawling framework, we perform the ﬁrst large-
scale study of linguistic-collision misspellings collecting 1.77
million search results for misspellings generated for 18,234
original keywords across English and Chinese.
• Our results show that linguistic-collision misspellings are
widely abused on both Google and Baidu, with around 1.19%
results on the ﬁrst search page directing to malicious websites.
We further perform detailed characterization of this class of
search poisoning, including the poisoned word categories,
effectiveness of misspelling generation approaches, and search
volume distribution.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Chinese Pinyin and Input Approach
Hanyu Pinyin (abbreviated as pinyin) is the phonetic system
to represent Chinese characters with Roman letters. Pinyin
provides a convenient way to learn Chinese and input Chinese
characters on computers. For example, the Chinese character
“果” can be encoded as the pinyin symbol Guo. Typically each
Chinese character is mapped to one pinyin (though there are
polyphonic Chinese characters), but one pinyin can represent
many different Chinese characters. This can introduce ambiguity
when transforming pinyin to Chinese characters. Moreover,
pronunciations of pinyin have four tones, which can be indicated
by a number following the pinyin. The aforementioned Chinese
character “果” (meaning “fruit”) maps to pinyin with the third
tone Guo3. Another Chinese character “锅” (meaning “pan”)
has the same pinyin spelling but a different tone Guo1.
Pinyin input method is the most widely used Chinese-input
approach [10] (compared to other input methods, like stroke-
based input method). Since the input is based on pronunciations,

it is easy for Chinese speakers to master. Any English keyboard
can type pinyin. After users type pinyin of a Chinese character,
the input method will display a list of characters corresponded
to that pinyin for users to select and use. For convenience,
pinyin input system typically does not provide selection of tone
marks. The presented possible Chinese characters match the
same pinyin spelling and do not distinguish tones. For example,
the above “果” and “锅” will be shown simultaneously, once
a user types the pinyin Guo (since they have the same pinyin
spelling).
B. Deep Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks
Deep learning has been applied to a wide range of problems
as computing power has grown signiﬁcantly. Neural networks
in particular have seen incredible successes in many application
domains. A neural network contains layers of neurons, which
provide the computation elements to predict future outputs. The
parameters of the neurons provide the memory and are adjusted
during training.
In this paper, we focus on a particular type of neural network,
the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which has been shown
to work well with sequential data [11, 12]. An RNN accepts an
input sequence of vectors and outputs a vector sequence. The
input and output symbols are generally converted to a one-hot
representation that allows the model to more easily learn the
relationships between the input and the output. The output
vectors encode the RNN’s estimate of the probability that a
given symbol should be selected in the output sequence. During
training, the correlation between input and output sequences is
learned using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [13]. For text
input, RNNs are typically used to deal with text at the word
level and have proven remarkably successful in generating text.
However, character-based RNNs deal with text at the alphabet
level and thus can be more robust when dealing with extremely
large vocabularies that may be difﬁcult to collect.
III. SEARCH ENGINE POISONING OF
MISSPELLED KEYWORDS
Misspelled keywords have been extensively exploited to
illicitly seize search trafﬁc and gain proﬁt [6, 8]. Recent reports
show that 10%–20% of queries on search engines contain
misspellings [14, 15]. These alternative keywords are typically
less expensive to purchase or less competitive to promote in
the search results, making misspellings attractive targets for
cybercriminals.
To counteract misspelling abuse and improve users’ experience,
over the past several years, major search engines, such as Google
and Baidu, have taken signiﬁcant strategy changes to provide
auto-suggestion or auto-correction [16, 17]. We use search
results from Google to illustrate different levels of correction
that search engines offer when a spelling mistake is detected.
As an example, for a original keyword adobe, misspelled
variants result in the following four search return types from
Google (sorted from high to low regarding mitigation against
misspellings in queries).
Figure 2: Search results of misspelling cilis on Google (original
target search word is cialis). Top results lead to illicit pharmaceutical
websites. Our investigation shows that some of these websites are
reported at blacklists and they have cloaking or redirection.
1) Showing-results-for (high conﬁdence about mis-
spellings). When search engines have high conﬁdence in what
the correct keyword should be, results for the corrected term
are directly returned. This is the strongest-level mitigation
against misspellings in queries, where the results of the
suspect misspelled keyword will not be shown at all. Users
are notiﬁed that search has been modiﬁed with the sign
“Showing results for”. As shown in Figure 1(a), search for
adoeb (transposition of b and e) will return all results for
adobe instead. Users still have the option to modify to
search for the previous query by explicitly clicking adoeb
in the notiﬁcation “Search instead for”.
2) Including-results-for (medium conﬁdence about
misspellings). If the spelling mistakes are less evident, search
engines may include results for the assumed correct keyword
as the top results with notiﬁcation “Including results for”.
The rest of the returned results are still for the misspelled
keyword. The motive is that users are more likely to click
on the results of the corrected keyword (which show as the
top results). As shown in Figure 1(b), search for adobec
(appending letter c) has the ﬁrst result of adobe and the
rest results for adobec. By clicking the suggested word
adobe in “Including result for” or the original misspelled
input adobec in “Search only for”, users can reﬁne which
word they indeed hope to search for.
