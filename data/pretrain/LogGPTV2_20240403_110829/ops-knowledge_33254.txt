User: Which linux distro is better suited for Python web development?
Background:
I currently develop on Windows and it's fine, but I am looking to move my core Python development to Linux. I'm sure most any distro will work fine, but does anyone have any reasons to believe one distro is better than another?
Assistant: I am working with Python on Cento 5.4 and Fedora 12 and I am very happy.
I also use Eclipse IDE for python and other languages without having any major issues.
