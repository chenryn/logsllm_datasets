User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can you join a computer to two domains? I have a new laptop that I intend to use both at home and at work.  I happen to have a windows server setup with active directory at home, and I want to join the laptop to both domains.  Is this possible?



Result: I've decided to join it to the work domain.  I definitely need to be able to log in to windows using my account on that domain at times, while the home network is much simpler (mainly just file/print sharing, though there is more to it).  I think I can manage at home by manually authenticating to the needed resources, and perhaps even script some of that away.

Assistant: Short answer: no.

Since you're talking about work and home domains, I don't imagine you can set up a trust between them.  OTOH, if you're even allowed to join a personal PC to the domain at work, maybe it's a small, informal company?

Workarounds: Join the home domain and just map individual resources and give your work credential, or maybe set up a VM on the laptop that's joined to the work domain.

Edit: while looking into this a bit more (because it's something a few of our remote users have asked about), I came across Globesoft MultiNetwork Manager, which says it can join one computer to two domains and switch easily between them.
