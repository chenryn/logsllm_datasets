### Akamai's Network Infrastructure and Measurement Capabilities

#### Host Network Characteristics
- **Network Size:** Large
- **Primary CDN Provider:** Akamai
- **Cache Functionality:** Mainly cache fill
- **Interconnection Type:** PNIs (Private Network Interconnections) with eyeball networks, IXP (Internet Exchange Point)
- **Bandwidth Requirements:** Medium/Large
- **Performance Level:** High
- **Deployment Types:**
  - **Type 1 and Type 2:** No Akamai-owned router; relies on the hosting network's router.
  - **Type 3 and Type 4:** Akamai-owned router with BGP sessions to IXP members and route servers.

#### Measurement and Monitoring
Akamai’s server clusters act as rich vantage points, producing a range of measurement data. These measurements are essential for maintaining an up-to-date view of Akamai’s connectivity fabric and ensuring optimal content delivery. The data collected includes:
- **Network Health and Performance:** Bandwidth usage, system load, latency, and packet loss.
- **Routing Information:** BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) information, including routes and BGP communities.

**Measurement Frequency:**
- Regular intervals (e.g., quarter-hourly, hourly, daily) due to the dynamic nature of the Internet.

**Data Collection and Analysis:**
- **Cluster-Specific Metrics:** Bandwidth usage and system load.
- **Network Conditions:** Latency and packet loss between different deployments.
- **Connectivity to Targets:** Measurements to popular name servers/resolvers and other targets to evaluate communication capabilities.

### BGP Collectors
Akamai operates 80 BGP collectors globally, which are non-delivery servers. These collectors:
- **Receive Routing Information:** From both Akamai and non-Akamai routers.
- **Translate BGP Communities:** Convert third-party network-specific BGP communities into a common set of Akamai-specific BGP communities.
- **Provide Input to Mapping System:** The collected BGP information is used by Akamai’s mapping system to make informed decisions about content delivery.

**Deployment Types and BGP Information:**
- **Type 1 and Type 2 Deployments:** Rely on the hosting network’s router, which sends BGP information to nearby BGP collectors.
- **Type 3 and Type 4 Deployments:** Use Akamai-owned routers that send routing table information to BGP collectors. The routing table contains only the "best" (active) routes from all received routes.

### Mapping System
Akamai’s mapping system is a key component of its service delivery platform, using DNS to route end-user clients to the most suitable deployment. The system:
- **Consumes Various Data:** Including BGP collector data and non-measurement data (e.g., peering link costs, topological information).
- **Flexible and Evolving:** Continuously updated to meet diverse customer needs and adapt to new Internet technologies.

### Connectivity Fabric
To assess the reach and structure of Akamai’s connectivity fabric, we analyze two datasets:
- **ViewA (Proprietary BGP Information):** Hourly snapshots of BGP tables from Akamai’s BGP collectors.
- **ViewP (Publicly Available BGP Information):** Combined data from Route-Views, RIPE NCC RIS, and Packet Clearing House.

**Key Findings:**
- **AS-Level Analysis:** Akamai sees 61.3k unique routeable ASes, compared to 58.6k in ViewP.
- **Prefix Analysis:** Akamai receives 1.75M unique IPv4 prefixes, while ViewP sees only 0.85M. Many of these additional prefixes are /25 or longer, indicating their importance for fine-grained content delivery.
- **AS Path Analysis:** Qualitative differences between ViewA and ViewP, with ViewA providing more detailed and specific routing information.

### Conclusion
Akamai’s extensive network infrastructure and advanced measurement capabilities enable it to deliver content efficiently and reliably. By leveraging proprietary and public BGP data, Akamai maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date view of its connectivity fabric, ensuring optimal performance for its global user base.
