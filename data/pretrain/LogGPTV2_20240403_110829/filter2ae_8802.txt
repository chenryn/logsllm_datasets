On December 3, 2018, @L3mOn disclosed a front-end Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Discuz x3.4. By leveraging a secondary jump and two parsing issues, the SSRF attack chain can be completed.

During our analysis with my colleague @dawu, we discovered that this vulnerability relies on multiple features, leading to various constraints in the exploitable environment and strong dependencies on certain conditions. These factors significantly reduce the potential impact of the vulnerability. Let's delve into a detailed analysis of this vulnerability.

## Conditions for the Vulnerability
- **Version:** Prior to commit `41eb5bb0a3a716f84b0ce4e4feb41e6f25a980a3` ([Patch link](https://gitee.com/ComsenzDiscuz/DiscuzX/commit/41eb5bb0a3a716f84b0ce4e4feb41e6f25a980a3))
- **PHP Version:** Greater than PHP 5.3
- **php-curl Extension:** Enabled

### Initial Exploit Attempt
Initially, it was thought that using a controlled URL like `http://127.0.0.1/{可控}` would be sufficient. However, this approach is ineffective as it only allows local attacks. Therefore, an arbitrary URL jump is necessary to make the exploit meaningful.

## URL Redirector Abuse
To meet the initial requirements, we need an arbitrary URL jump that is of the "GET" type and does not require login. When logging out, Discuz retrieves the value from the `referer` parameter (not the header) and then performs a 301 redirect. The key requirement here is to have some validation on the host. Let's examine the relevant code:

```php
/source/function/function_core.php:1498
```

The screenshot below highlights the main issue with this code, with the critical part framed in red.

For the `referer` to remain unchanged, the host must be limited to a single character. However, if the host can only be one character, we cannot control the arbitrary URL jump. Thus, we need to find a way to make `parse_url` and `curl` interpret the same URL differently.

### Example
Consider the following URL:
```
http://localhost#@www.baidu.com/
```

- `parse_url` interprets this as `localhost`.
- `curl` interprets this as `www.baidu.com`.

Let's capture a packet to illustrate this:

We successfully bypassed the various limitations.

## Exploitation
With the SSRF and arbitrary URL jump techniques in place, we can now construct the attack chain. The process is as follows:

1. **Cutimg SSRF Link**
   - ===>
   - **Server Accesses URL Redirector Abuse During Logout**
     - ===301==>
     - **Redirect to Malicious Server**
       - ===302==>
       - **Arbitrary Target (e.g., gopher, HTTP, etc.)**

When accessing the cutimg page for the first time, you need to obtain the `forghash` and modify the `referer` accordingly; otherwise, the request will be intercepted.
