### Category Involving Parked, Expired, or Yet-to-Be Developed Domains

Based on the two distinct crawls, we can conclude that cryptojacking is more prevalent on domains hosting adult content.

One notable observation is that a specific miner hosted its own mining pool and generated significant traffic in January 2018, only to nearly disappear weeks later. Coinhive, the most widely used application by websites, remains a constant factor in the miner landscape, with over 4,000 NetFlows per day in mid-2018 (corresponding to approximately 32 million connections per day, given our 1:8192 sampling rate). However, this figure is not as high as one might expect from its installation base. Additionally, a clear declining trend in NetFlow counts to all mining services can be observed after the summer of 2018. The most recent months of NetFlow data show a diverse set of mining applications still in active use.

### 7. An Internet-Scale Study on Cryptojacking

To estimate the prevalence of browser-based cryptojacking on the Internet and to identify any differences between Top Level Domains (TLDs), we conducted another crawl. This involved crawling approximately 20% of the websites belonging to each of the 1,136 existing TLDs. We obtained daily zone transfers for all generic top-level domains (gTLDs) such as .top, .loan, from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), and a feed of registered country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .uk, .jp, or .ru from a security intelligence provider. From these lists, we randomly selected a sample of approximately 20% of the size of each TLD [12]. Based on the results of the previous crawl, we added five additional mining applications to the crawler implementation, as listed in Appendix C. From January 11 to April 3, 2019, we crawled the random sample, which included 48.9 million domains, resulting in a total of 125 TB of network traffic.

#### 7.1 General Findings

After crawling a random sample of 48.9 million websites across a large number of different TLDs, we can draw conclusions about the prevalence of browser-based cryptojacking on the Internet. We estimate that 0.011% of all domains are actively cryptomining without their visitors' explicit consent.

### 8. Discussion

Crawling the Internet inevitably comes with limitations. These can include issues in the crawler implementation, network usage, and analysis, which may result in both false positives and negatives. For example, extreme obfuscation can lead to false negatives, as seen in Section 6. However, we believe that our double crawling strategy, based on both WebAssembly and code signatures, has minimized such occurrences. The use of worldwide NetFlow traffic from a Tier 1 network operator allowed us to analyze the popularity of cryptojacking services in a novel way, although BGP policies and specific PoP and IXP footprints could introduce biases. Additionally, since NetFlows do not reveal the actual contents of the connection, we cannot be entirely certain about the contents. However, during our crawls, we confirmed that the mining applications contacted the WebSocket proxy servers in question, and passive DNS lookups did not show any other domains pointing to those IPs. Furthermore, the NetFlows revealed no traffic to other ports than those seen from our crawlers, and packet sizes resembled those observed in our crawls, thus validating our methodology.

**Future Work:** The additional perspective provided by the NetFlow data allowed us to study the evolution of cryptojacking over a longer period, something not previously done. Regular crawls of the Internet, especially of identified cryptojacking domains, will provide deeper insights into this practice and enhance defense mechanisms. The most effective defense against cryptojacking remains frequent patching, as most cryptominers exploit known vulnerabilities. CMS providers like Drupal and WordPress have shown agility in patching, but the responsibility of installing these patches lies with the website owner. Given the decline in Monero's value (-85% in 2018), we expect individual cryptojacking activities to decrease, but cybercriminals may seek new ways to exploit cryptojacking at a larger scale. As mentioned in Section 3, launching a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is an effective method for collecting large groups of miners. Investigating the prevalence of this attack vector for cryptomining is reserved for future work.

### 9. Conclusions

In this paper, we studied the prevalence of cryptojacking and cryptojacking campaigns on the Internet. We performed multiple large-scale crawls, each with a different focus. Our first crawl analyzed the 1.7 million most popular domains to identify organized campaigns, revealing 204 campaigns. This suggests that the size of cryptojacking campaigns is significantly underestimated by current academic research. Using only the Alexa Top 1M list shows different results in terms of the size of organized activity and infection rates, which we found to be almost six times lower in a random sample compared to the Alexa Top 1M, thus overestimating the problem. Third-party software is often used by attackers to spread cryptojacking scripts over many domains. The share of domains serving advertisements injected with cryptojacking scripts is lower compared to previous studies, likely due to stricter monitoring by ad networks. Obfuscation of cryptojacking scripts is present but not frequently used. Comparing our results with data from previous studies (in February and March 2018) shows that only 15% of the websites were still actively mining after a year. This, combined with our novel method of estimating miner application popularity through NetFlow analysis, led us to conclude that the cryptojacking landscape is constantly changing and involves a variety of actors.

A second, Internet-scale crawl involving approximately 20% of 1,136 TLDs (48.9 million websites) provides a truly random sample of the Internet. This allows us to conclude that cryptojacking is present on 0.011% of all domains. Unsurprisingly, this percentage increases in more popular parts of the Internet, as cryptojacking on popular domains is more lucrative. Both crawls showed that cryptojacking primarily occurs on websites hosting adult content, although the .xxx TLD contains only one cryptojacking website. Based on the applications used within our analysis period, we concluded that Coinhive was the largest mining application in terms of installation base, but Coin-Impâ€™s WebSocket proxy servers processed much more traffic in 2018. Looking at different TLDs, we found that Russian, Brazilian, and Spanish zones host a disproportionate number of cryptojacking domains.

With the discontinuation of Coinhive in March 2019, the cryptojacking landscape has changed significantly. Based on our results, we expect a further decline in individual cryptojacking activities as the value of Monero continues to diminish. However, this underscores the importance of organized cryptojacking campaigns, as cybercriminals will find new ways to spread their infections to remain profitable. Campaign analysis will be a crucial asset, as adversaries are unlikely to develop unique approaches for each infected website. The reuse of resources and methods will provide an effective angle to detect and mitigate these activities.
