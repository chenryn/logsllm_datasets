category involving parked, expired or yet-to-be developed
domains. Based on these two very different crawls we can
conclude that cryptojacking is indeed more prevailing on
domains hosting adult content.

Coinhive, the application used by most websites, is a constant
factor in the miner landscape with over 4,000 NetFlows a day
in mid 2018 (given our 1:8192 sampling, thus 32M connec-
tions per day), but not as large as one would expect from its
installation base. Additionally, a clear declining trend can be
observed in the NetFlow counts to all mining services after
the summer of 2018. The last months of NetFlow data show
a diverse set of mining applications actively used.
7 An Internet scale study on cryptojacking
In order to estimate the prevalence of browser-based crypto-
jacking on the Internet and to indicate any differences between
Top Level Domains (TLDs), we have performed another crawl,
in which we have crawled ~20% of the websites belonging to
each of the 1,136 existing TLDs. We obtained a daily zone
transfer for all generic top level domains (gTLDs) – such
as .top, .loan – from the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN), as well as a feed of registered
country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) – such as .uk, .jp,
or .ru – from a security intelligence provider. From these
lists, we randomly picked a sample of ~20% of the size of
each TLD [12]. Based on the results of the previous crawl,
we have added another 5 mining applications to the crawler
implementation, as listed in Appendix C. From January 11
until April 3, 2019, we crawled the random sample including
48.9M domains. This yielded a total of 125 TB of network
trafﬁc.
7.1 General ﬁndings
After crawling a random sample of 48.9M websites in a large
number of different top level domains, we are able to draw con-
clusions about the prevalence of browser-based cryptojacking
on the Internet. We estimate that 0.011% of all domains are
actively cryptomining without their visitors’ explicit consent,

8 Discussion
Crawling the Internet inevitably comes with its shortcomings.
Limitations in the crawler implementation, network used and
analysis can produce both false positives and negatives. The
latter category can occur for example when extreme obfus-
cation is used, as we have seen in Section 6. However, we
believe that due to our double crawling strategy, based on
both WebAssembly and code signatures, this could not have
happened very often. Finally, the use of worldwide NetFlow
trafﬁc from a Tier 1 network operator allowed us to analyze
the popularity of cryptojacking services in a revolutionary
way, although BGP policies, and a speciﬁc PoP and IXP foot-
print could lead to a bias of certain autonomous systems just
as some discrepancies might arise due to 1:8192 random sam-
pling. Additionally, since the NetFlows do not reveal the ac-
tual contents of the connection, we can never be sure about the
contents. However, during our crawls we could conﬁrm the
mining applications to contact the WebSocket proxy servers
in question, and passive DNS lookups did not show any other
domains pointed to that IP. Furthermore, the NetFlows both
revealed no trafﬁc to other ports than those seen from our
crawlers and packet sizes resembling those observed in our
crawls, thus the methodology should provide valid results.
Future work The additional angle provided by the NetFlow
data allowed us to study the evolution of cryptojacking over a
longer period of time, something which has not been done be-

7.2 Cryptojacking on different TLDs
We have crawled domains of roughly ~20% of 1,136 different
TLDs in order to analyze the prevalence of cryptojacking.
As Table 8 shows, cryptojacking activity varies enormously
within different TLD zones. The four largest TLDs, .com,
.de, .net and .org have a similar percentage of cryptojacking
websites, but we have discovered almost 6 times as much
cryptojacking activity in the Russian TLD. Also, domains
in the Brazilian and Spanish zones are more susceptible to
cryptojacking, having respectively 4 and 3 times more cryp-
tojacking activity than average. On the contrary, the .top, .us
and .loan zones host only a few cryptojacking websites.
Our website category analysis showed that adult content
is the most prevailing category for cryptojacking activities.
This triggered our attention for the .xxx domain, which is spe-
cially created for adult content, which we therefore crawled
completely instead of ~20%. Surprisingly, the .xxx domain
contains only one website actively cryptomining.
When comparing used mining applications on the different
TLDs, large differences can be distinguished, as shown in
Figure 9. Coinhive is the most popular miner in most zones,
whereas Cryptoloot is preferred in the Russian zone, and
French and Czech websites contain more Nerohut miners.
The Russian zone is also the only TLD where browsermine
is used regularly. The high number of generic miner applica-
tions in the Dutch and Belgian zone is remarkable. A large
number of these domains in the .nl and .be zone are part of a
campaign using expired domain names of a Dutch registrar
(Totaaldomein B.V.) to host porn and unknown cryptominers.
Our results show a different popularity of used mining ap-
plications compared to previous work of [41]. They detected
Coinhive on 85% to 90% of the .com, .net and .org TLDs,
whereas we determine that this market share is signiﬁcantly
lower (~50%). This result proves that a simple solution like
the NoCoin block list is unable to detect all miners and analy-
ses with such techniques result in different outcomes.

fore. Regular crawls of the Internet, especially of the already
identiﬁed cryptojacking domains gives more insight in this
practice, as will it increase the innovation of defense mecha-
nisms. The most inﬂuential defense against cryptojacking will
nonetheless be frequent patching, as most cryptominers are
installed exploiting known vulnerabilities. CMS providers,
such as Drupal or WordPress, have shown agility in patch-
ing vulnerabilities, but the responsibility of installing these
patches remains with the website owner. Finally, as we have
seen a decline in the price of Monero (-85% in 2018), we
believe that cryptojacking infections on individual websites
will decrease, but that cyber criminals will search for other
possibilities to exploit cryptojacking at an even larger scale.
As we have mentioned in Section 3, the most effective method
of collecting large groups of miners is by launching a MITM
attack. Investigating the prevalence of this attack vector for
cryptomining is something we preserve for future work.
9 Conclusions
In this paper, we have studied the prevalence of cryptojacking
as well as of cryptojacking campaigns on the Internet. We
have performed multiple large crawls, each with a different
focus. In our ﬁrst crawl, we have analyzed the 1.7M most
popular domains to identify organized campaigns. We found
204 campaigns, from which we conclude that the size of
cryptojacking campaigns is heavily underestimated by current
academic research. Additionally, using solely the Alexa Top
1M shows signiﬁcantly different results in terms of the size
of organized activity and infection rate, which we found to
be almost 6 times lower in a random sample compared to the
Alexa Top 1M, hence overestimating the problem. Third-party
software is often used by attackers to spread cryptojacking
scripts over a large number of domains. The share of domains
serving advertisements injected with cryptojacking scripts
is lower compared to previous work, most likely because
of stricter monitoring by advertisement networks. We have
seen that obfuscation of cryptojacking scripts is deﬁnitely
present, but only occasionally used. Comparing our results
with data from previous studies (in both February and March
2018) shows that after a year, only 15% of the websites is
still actively mining. This, and our novel way of estimating
miner application popularity by analyzing NetFlows, led to
the conclusion that the cryptojacking landscape is constantly
changing and involves a variety of actors.
A second, Internet-scale crawl involving ~20% of 1,136
TLDs (48.9M websites), which represents a truly random
sample of the Internet, allows us to conclude that cryptojack-
ing is present on 0.011% of all domains. Not unexpectedly,
this percentage increases in the more popular parts of the
Internet, because cryptojacking on popular domains is much
more lucrative. Both of our crawls have shown that crypto-
jacking mostly takes place on websites hosting adult content,
although the .xxx TLD is home to only one cryptojacking
website. Based on the applications used within the time span
of our analysis, we can conclude that Coinhive was the largest
mining application in terms of installation base, but that Coin-
Imp’s WebSocket proxy servers were digesting much more
trafﬁc in 2018. Looking at the different TLDs, we conclude
that Russian, Brazilian and Spanish zones are home to a dis-
proportionate number of cryptojacking domains.
With the discontinuation of Coinhive in March 2019, the
landscape of cryptojacking has changed enormously, but
based on our results, we are only expecting a further decline
in individual cryptojacking activities given that the Monero
value keeps diminishing. However, this only stresses the im-
portance of organized cryptojacking campaigns, as cyber crim-
inals will ﬁnd new ways to spread their cryptojacking infec-
tions to still be proﬁtable. Here, campaign analysis will be
an important asset: as adversaries are unlikely to develop a
unique approach for each infected website, the reuse of re-
sources and methods will provide an effective angle to detect
and mitigate these activities.
