Assistant: This log chunk shows the initialization of the worker environment, with the workerEnv.init() ok message appearing multiple times. It also shows the mod_jk child workerEnv in error state 6, 7, and 8. Lastly, it shows the jk2_init() Found child messages, indicating the initialization of multiple children in the scoreboard slots.
