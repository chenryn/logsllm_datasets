Simple thing we can do:
  * Provide a TilesViewResolver subclass of UrlBasedViewResolver that configures the viewClass to be TilesView as a convenience
First noticed this when explaining configuring you need to configure a URL
resolver for Tiles view proved quite complex. It's simpler to just say
configure a Tiles view resolver.
