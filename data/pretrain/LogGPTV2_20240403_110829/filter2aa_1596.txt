## Correlation of IDS/Sensors
- **Previous Research Project:**
  - Presented at DefCon 9 & 10
  - Utilized Bayesian Multiple Hypothesis Tracking to analyze reports from multiple Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) scattered throughout a large network
  - Aimed to determine if detected events were related or independent

## Escalation of the Situation
- **Reflections on the Research:**
  - How could such a system be defeated if it worked effectively?
  - How could one avoid detection, particularly in ongoing communication?

## The Core Question
- **Objective:**
  - How can one communicate on a network without being detected?
  - **Initial Considerations:**
    - Understanding the methods used for detection
    - Identifying key components like IDS, firewalls, and observers

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- **Types of Detection:**
  - **Signature Detection:**
    - Detects known attacks or events
    - Avoidance requires using an unknown or constantly changing method
  - **Anomaly Detection:**
    - Detects unusual behavior rather than specific misuse
    - Effective in identifying unknown attacks or events

### Anomaly Detection Avoidance
- **Strategy:**
  - Use a "random" or "changing" communication channel to evade signature detection
  - **Avoiding Unusual Behavior:**
    - **Network Baseline Detection:**
      - **First Stage:**
        - Passively discover the network's normal traffic patterns
        - Identify allowed and typical traffic
    - **Entropy in Network Traffic:**
      - High entropy data streams are better for hiding information
      - Potential channels include timing, checksums, and other packet data

## Overall Concept
- **Steps:**
  - **Detect Existing Network Baseline Conditions:**
    - Identify what constitutes normal network traffic
  - **Select Potential Communication Channels:**
    - Determine highly random information on the network
    - Prune and select appropriate channels
    - Communicate the chosen method to the receiver
  - **Maintain an Undetectable Presence:**
    - Continuously monitor and update to stay hidden
