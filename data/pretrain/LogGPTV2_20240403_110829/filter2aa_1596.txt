About myself
• Assistant Professor at UCF
• Research includes
– Correlation of distributed network sensors
– Law enforcement data sharing network
Correlation of IDS/Sensors
• Previous research project I worked on
– Presented at DefCon 9 & 10
– Used Bayesian Multiple Hypothesis Tracking to 
analyze reports from multiple IDS scattered 
throughout a large network
– Attempt to determine if events being detected are 
related or not
Escalation of the Situation
• That got me thinking
– How would you defeat such a system (if it worked)
– How could you avoid detection
• Not the detection of an attack, but the ongoing 
communication
– Or, how could you secretly communicate on a 
network
Here’s the question
• How do you communicate on a network without 
letting anyone know that you are doing it?
• First thing to figure out
– How do they detect what is going on?
– IDS
– Firewalls
– Observers
IDS
• Two basic forms of detection
– Anomaly and Signature
• Signature Detection
– Known attacks / events
– Only way to avoid is to use an unknown method or an 
ever changing method
• Anomaly detection
– Doesn’t detect misuse – detects unusual behavior
– Only chance someone has at detecting an unknown 
attack / event
Anomaly Detection Avoidance
• If we use a “random” or “changing”
communication channel, signature detection can 
be avoided
• How do we avoid looking unusual?
• Detection of the network baseline
– First stage: 
Discover what the network looks like
– What traffic is allowed?
– What does normal traffic look like?
– Do this passively
Detection of Entropy in the Network
• Some aspects of the network traffic are going to 
have a low entropy, other will have a high 
entropy
• Information can best be hidden in a high entropy 
data stream
• Lots of available channels
– Timing
– Checksums
– All the other data in a packet
Overall Concept
• Detect existing network baseline conditions
– What does normal look like?
• Select potential communications channels
– Determination of highly random information on network
– Pruning of information channels
– Communicating the method to the receiver
• Maintain an (almost) undetectable presence
– Monitoring and updating to stay hidden
