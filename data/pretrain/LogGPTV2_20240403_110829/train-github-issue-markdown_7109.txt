# Bug report
## Describe the bug
An index page implemented within a subdirectory behaves differently between
development and production modes.
When the next server is started in dev mode everything seems to work as
expected. When running in "production" mode via `next build` and `next start`
the event listeners on page do not fire.
## To Reproduce
I created a minimal example here: https://github.com/hoffrocket/next8bug
## Expected behavior
I'd expect the same behavior in production as in dev. The event listeners
should fire.
## System information
  * OS: macOS
  * chrome, safari
  * Version of Next.js: 8.0.1
  * Version of node: 8.14.0
