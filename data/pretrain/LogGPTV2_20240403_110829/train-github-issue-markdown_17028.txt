Subject: Issue with Next.js, URQL, and ZEIT SASS in Production Mode

Hello,

I am currently experiencing a problem while running my Next.js application in production. The project utilizes URQL for GraphQL queries and the ZEIT SASS package for styling.

In development mode, the app functions correctly when navigating through different routes. However, after building and starting the application in production, I encounter an issue:

- When I directly access the second route (e.g., `localhost:3000/test` without a GraphQL query) and then attempt to navigate to a route that requires a query (e.g., `localhost:3000/`), the query does not execute, and the app remains on the initial route (`localhost:3000/test`).

I initially reported this as a potential bug to the URQL team (referenced here: [urql-graphql/urql#411](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/issues/411)), but they were unable to provide a solution.

To help reproduce the issue, I have created a repository:
- **Repository:** [next-urql-sass/tree/master/examples/3-ssr-with-nextjs](https://github.com/erickm/next-urql-sass/tree/master/examples/3-ssr-with-nextjs)

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies.
2. Run `yarn build && yarn start`.
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000/test`.
4. Attempt to navigate to the home page (`localhost:3000/`); this is where the issue occurs.

The error seems to be related to passing data props to a custom component, specifically when using the SASS function. If I remove the `withSass` configuration from `next.config.js` and eliminate the SASS imports and styles, the app works as expected.

For visual reference, I have created a GIF demonstrating the issue:

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this issue.
