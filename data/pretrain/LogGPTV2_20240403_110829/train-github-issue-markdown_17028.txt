Hi,
I've run into a problem while running my next.js app in production. I use
next.js with URQL and the ZEIT SASS package for next.js. When i run the app in
dev mode it runs fine while navigating the routes. After i build the app and
start it in production i run into a problem though.
If i go to my second route directly (localhost:3000/test, without a graphql
query) and try navigating to a route with a query (localhost:3000/) it won't
execute the query and stays on the initial route (localhost:300/test). I first
reported a bug with the guys from URQL (urql-graphql/urql#411) but they
couldn't help me.
To reproduce my issue i created a repo to check out:
https://github.com/erickm/next-urql-sass/tree/master/examples/3-ssr-with-
nextjs.
It looks like the error occurs while passing the data props to a custom
component (only when using the sass function, without the sass pacakge it
works fine).
To reproduce:
  1. checkout the repo & install
  2. `yarn build && yarn start`
  3. navigate to `localhost:3000/test`
  4. try to go to the home page (here is where i get stuck)
When i remove withSass in the next.config.js and remove the sass imports and
sytles, build it and start it again it works fine.
For reference i created a gif:
