### rdpsign

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `rdpsign` command allows you to digitally sign a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) file. This ensures that the RDP file is from a trusted source and has not been tampered with.

**Note:**
To learn about the latest features in Remote Desktop Services, refer to [What's New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server](#).

**Syntax:**
```sh
rdpsign /sha1 <thumbprint> [/q | /v] [/l] <file.rdp>
rdpsign /sha256 <thumbprint> [/q | /v] [/l] <file.rdp>
```

**Parameters:**

- **/sha1 <thumbprint>**
  - Specifies the SHA1 hash of the signing certificate included in the certificate store.
  - Used in Windows Server 2012 R2 and older versions.

- **/sha256 <thumbprint>**
  - Specifies the SHA256 hash of the signing certificate included in the certificate store.
  - Replaces `/sha1` in Windows Server 2016 and newer versions.

- **/q**
  - Quiet mode. No output is displayed when the command succeeds; minimal output is shown if the command fails.

- **/v**
  - Verbose mode. Displays all warnings, messages, and status information.

- **/l**
  - Test mode. Simulates the signing process and outputs the results without modifying the input files.

- **<file.rdp>**
  - The name of the .rdp file to be signed. You must specify the full file name. Wildcard characters are not accepted.

- **/?**
  - Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- The SHA1 or SHA256 certificate thumbprint should represent a trusted RDP file publisher.
- To obtain the certificate thumbprint, open the Certificates snap-in, double-click the desired certificate (in either the local computer's certificates store or your personal certificates store), click the "Details" tab, and then select "Thumbprint" from the field list.
- When copying the thumbprint for use with the `rdpsign.exe` tool, ensure that any spaces are removed.
- The signed output files will overwrite the original input files.
- If multiple files are specified and any of the .rdp files cannot be read or written to, the tool will continue to the next file.

**Examples:**

1. **Sign an .rdp file named `file1.rdp`:**
   ```sh
   rdpsign /sha1 <thumbprint> file1.rdp
   ```
   - Replace `<thumbprint>` with the actual SHA1 certificate thumbprint, without any spaces.

2. **Test whether digital signing will succeed for an .rdp file without actually signing it:**
   ```sh
   rdpsign /sha1 <thumbprint> /l file1.rdp
   ```

3. **Sign multiple .rdp files named `file1.rdp`, `file2.rdp`, and `file3.rdp`:**
   ```sh
   rdpsign /sha1 <thumbprint> file1.rdp file2.rdp file3.rdp
   ```
