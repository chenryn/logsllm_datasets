Syntax
rdpsign /sha1  [/q | /v |] [/l] 
Parameters
Parameter
Description
/sha1 
Specifies the thumbprint, which is the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1) hash of the signing certificate that is included in the certificate store. Used in Windows Server 2012 R2 and older.
/sha256 
Specifies the thumbprint, which is the Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA256) hash of the signing certificate that is included in the certificate store. Replaces /sha1 in Windows Server 2016 and newer.
/q
Quiet mode. No output when the command succeeds and minimal output if the command fails.
/v
verbose mode. Displays all warnings, messages, and status.
/l
Tests the signing and output results without actually replacing any of the input files.
The name of the .rdp file. You must specify the .rdp file (or files) to sign by using the full file name. Wildcard characters are not accepted.
/?
Displays help at the command prompt.
Remarks
The SHA1 or SHA256 certificate thumbprint should represent a trusted .rdp file publisher. To obtain the certificate thumbprint, open the Certificates snap-in, double-click the certificate that you want to use (either in the local computer's certificates store or in your personal certificates store), click the details tab, and then in the Field list, click Thumbprint.
Note
When you copy the thumbprint for use with the rdpsign.exe tool, you must remove any spaces.
The signed output files overwrite the input files.
If multiple files are specified, and if any of the .rdp files can't be read or written to, the tool continues to the next file.
Examples
To sign an .rdp file named file1.rdp, navigate to the folder where you saved the .rdp file, and then type:
rdpsign /sha1 hash file1.rdp
Note
The hash value represents the SHA1 certificate thumbprint, without any spaces.
To test whether digital signing will succeed for an .rdp file without actually signing the file, type:
rdpsign /sha1 hash /l file1.rdp
To sign multiple .rdp files that are named, file1.rdp, file2.rdp, and file3.rdp, type (including the spaces between file names):
rdpsign /sha1 hash file1.rdp file2.rdp file3.rdp
