## Abstract
Large content providers (CPs) are continuously expanding their service infrastructures, or "peering edges," to meet the growing demand for content. A critical component of these infrastructures is the connectivity fabric, which encompasses all Internet interconnections that content must traverse from the CP's deployments to end users. Despite its importance, this aspect has received limited attention and remains poorly understood.

In this paper, we present an in-depth study of Akamai's connectivity fabric. Our findings reveal that Akamai's connectivity fabric consists of approximately 6,100 explicit peerings (where Akamai is one of the peers) and about 28,500 implicit peerings (where Akamai is not directly involved). This work contributes to a better understanding of real-world serving infrastructures by providing insights into implicit peerings and demonstrating the performance benefits Akamai can achieve by leveraging its rich connectivity fabric.

## 1 Introduction
Today's large Internet content providers (CPs), including major content delivery networks (CDNs), face the challenge of serving increasing traffic volumes to a diverse and growing number of endpoints. These endpoints, such as end users and IoT devices, reside in various types of networks and require stringent performance guarantees. The serving infrastructures maintained by these CPs play a crucial role in addressing this challenge.

A CP's serving infrastructure, also known as its "Internet peering edge" or "peering surface," comprises two main components:
1. **Footprint**: A set of deployments, each consisting of one or more clusters of servers. Deployments may include end user-facing server clusters (edge nodes or serving sites) and other types of deployments.
2. **Connectivity Fabric**: The set of Internet interconnections or peerings that content traverses from the CP's deployments to end users.

The focus of our study is on the connectivity fabric, which has received little attention despite its critical role in content delivery. We provide a detailed account of Akamai's serving infrastructure, particularly its connectivity fabric, to highlight the important but often overlooked aspects of this component.

## 2 Overview of Akamai’s Serving Infrastructure

### 2.1 Basic Components: Footprint
Akamai's servers can be categorized into three groups:
- **End-User Facing (EUF) Delivery Servers**: HTTP/S servers directly involved in serving content to end users.
- **Non-End-User Facing (non-EUF) Delivery Servers**: HTTP/S servers indirectly involved in content delivery (e.g., serving content to storage servers or transcoding media).
- **Non-Delivery Servers**: Servers used for purposes other than content delivery, such as BGP collectors.

Our primary interest lies in the combination of EUF delivery servers and BGP collectors. Akamai's EUF delivery servers run custom-built software on specialized hardware, offering flexible configuration and various capabilities. These servers communicate using HTTP/S with other Akamai servers, customers' origin servers, and end-user devices. Akamai's EUF delivery servers are organized into clusters located in approximately 3,300 deployments across more than 1,600 networks worldwide.

### 2.2 Typical Deployment Types
Akamai's 3,300 deployments vary in size, design, role, and capabilities. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of four generic deployment types, which account for over 85% of all deployments:

| **Type** | **Size** | **IP Address Space** | **AS Used** | **Akamai Transit Link** | **Cache Fill** | **Serve End Users** | **Target End Users/Networks** | **Proximity to End Users** | **Typical Setting** | **Atypical Setting** |
|----------|----------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Type 1** | Small/Medium | Host Network | Host Network | No | Can serve all end users | Host/Downstreams | High/Very High | Eyeball network | Wholesale network |
| **Type 2** | Small/Medium | Host Network | Host Network | No | Can serve all end users | Host/Downstreams | High/Very High | Eyeball network | Wholesale network |
| **Type 3** | Medium/Large | Akamai | Akamai | Yes | Cache fill | Can serve all end users | Global | Very High | Any network | - |
| **Type 4** | Medium/Large | Akamai | Akamai | Yes | Cache fill | Can serve all end users | Global | Very High | Any network | - |

### 2.3 An Infrastructure for Measurement
Akamai's deployments also serve as vantage points for a global-scale measurement platform. This platform continuously evolves to meet changing needs and provides valuable insights into the state and performance of the network and infrastructure components.

## 3 Connectivity Fabric Analysis
We conducted an in-depth study of Akamai's connectivity fabric, revealing a bifurcation into 6,100 explicit peerings and 28,500 implicit peerings. Explicit peerings involve Akamai as one of the peers, while implicit peerings do not. We discuss the information sources required to fully account for this rich connectivity fabric and explain why publicly available BGP data provides an inadequate picture.

We also show that different deployment types contribute unevenly to Akamai's connectivity fabric. For example, Type 3 and Type 4 deployments, which use Akamai-owned border routers, contribute only explicit peerings, while Type 1 and Type 2 deployments, which rely on hosting network-owned routers, contribute only implicit peerings.

## 4 Performance Benefits
To optimize content delivery performance, Akamai leverages its rich connectivity fabric. We quantify the performance benefits Akamai reaps from this approach, demonstrating how it can improve the end-user experience by getting content closer to the end users.

## Conclusion
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of Akamai's serving infrastructure, with a focus on its connectivity fabric. By highlighting the importance of both explicit and implicit peerings, we contribute to a better understanding of the complex and critical role of connectivity in large-scale content delivery.
