ABSTRACT
Workflow management systems (WfMSs) have been used to support a variety of
business processes. As organizations adopt new working models, such as e-commerce,
new challenges arise for workflow systems. These challenges include support fort he
adequate management of quality of service (QoS) and the development of new solutions
to facilitate the composition of workflow applications involving Web services. The good
management of QoS directly impacts the success of organizations participating in e-
commerce activities by better fulfilling customer expectations and achieving customer
satisfaction. To enable adequate QoS management, research is required to develop
mechanisms that specify, compute, monitor, and control the QoS of the products or
services to be delivered. The composition of workflows to model e-service applications
differs from the design of traditional workflows due to the number of Web services
available during the composition process and to their heterogeneity. Two main problems
need to be solved: how to efficiently discover Web services and how to facilitate their
interoperability.
To enhance WfMSs with QoS management, we have developed a QoS model that
allows for the description of nonfunctional aspects of workflow components, from a
quality of service perspective. To automatically compute the overall QoS of a workflow,
we have developed a mathematical model and mi plemented an algorithm (SWR
algorithm). Our QoS model and mathematical model have been validated with the
deployment and execution of a set of production workflows in the area of genetics. The
analysis of the collected data proves that our models provide a suitable framework for
estimating, predicting, and analyzing the QoS of production workflows.
To support, facilitate, and assist the composition of workflows involving Web
services, we present a solution based on ontologies. We have developed an algorithm that
workflow systems and discovery mechanisms can use to find Web services with desired
interfaces and operational metrics, and to assist designers in resolving heterogeneity
issues among Web services. Our approach provides an important solution to enhance
Web service discovery and interoperability.
INDEX WORDS: workflow management systems (WfMSs), quality of service (QoS),

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW
Semantics are critical to support the next generation of the Web. The important
contribution of the “Semantic Web”, vis-à-vis the current Web, is the ability to represent
and process descriptions of every resource on the Web. A resource description,
informally called its “semantics”, includes that information about the resource thta can be
used by computers – not just for display purposes, but for using it for automatic
processing in various applications.
This dissertation focuses on two issues: semantic Web services and process
composition. Semantic Web services are Web services with a formal description
(semantics) that can enable a better discovery, selection, composition, monitoring, and
interoperability. Processes are next steps to carrying out core business activities, such as
e-commerce and e-services, and are created from the composition of Web Services or
other components.
This dissertation is about associating semantics to Web Services, and exploiting it in
process composition. The composition process involves a functional perspective and an
operational perspective. The functional perspective involves Web Service Discovery,
addressing semantic heterogeneity handling .The operational perspective takes form of
the research on QoS specification for Web Services and Processes.

1.1 WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Workflow management systems (WfMSs) are a key tool that can be employed by
organizations motivated to improve their competitive advantage, customer service,
productivity, and conformity with standards.
A few decades ago, work was carried on traditionally; work items passed from one
participant or worker to another. Business processes were coordinated and managed by
their participants, since they inherently knew their own business rules. With the
introduction of workflow systems the process itself became automated and the system
became responsible for the scheduling and execution of tasks associated with various
processes.
WfMSs are based on the concept of a workflow; this is an abstraction of a business
process. A workflow normally comprises a number of logical steps (known as tasks),
dependencies among tasks, routing rules, and participants. A task can require human
involvement, or it might be executed automatically by applications .
A workflow system reads, automates, processes, and manages workflows by
coordinating the sharing and routing of information. During processing, tasks,
information, and documents are passed from one participant to another in a manner
governed by a set of rules, routes, and roles. Workflow instances run on one or more
workflow engines which are able to interpret workflow definitions, interact with
workflow participants, and, where required, invoke the use of external tools and
applications.
The automation of work items increases process efficiency. Furthermore, the
management and analysis of workflow instances provides an opportunity for measuring
the execution of the parameters of business processes, in order that continuous
improvements can be implemented( Cardoso, Miller et al. 2002).

1.2 WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS EVOLUTION
The idea of workflow management systems arose in the 90’s. Yet, there is some
consensus that the office information systems (OIS) field, an important field in the 70’s,
is the predecessor of workflow systems (Edward and Zhao 2001). The first OIS
prototypes were developed in the late seventies. Pioneer systems included the SCOOP
project (Zisman 1977), which was oriented to the automation of office procedures, and
Officetalk (Ellis 1979; Ellis and Bernal 1982), which provided a visual electronic desktop
metaphor, a set of personal productivity tools for manipulating information, and a
networked environment for sharing information.
In the 80’s, due to several failures in office automation projects and installations
(Hammer 1984; Suchman and Wynn 1984), the interest in office information systems
declined, and work was directed towards researching flexible groupware systems and
models (Ellis and Nutt 1996). Then, in the 90’s, there was a resurgence of interest in OIS.
New technological approaches, such as transaction processing, document image
processing, and integrated office systems were investigated and developed. The
fundamental support of these technologies have paved the way for the emergence of
workflow management technology, which claimed to be one of the innovative
applications of the 90’s. Alonso et al (1996) point out that they are highly innovative;
they also observe that workflow management systems have gained a high level of
popularity. Nevertheless, these systems have not yet matured into wel-lproven and stable
technologies.
1.3 MOTIVATION
The work described in this dissertation focuses on the enhancement of workflow systems
to respond to current requirements. Two areas are studied: quality of service (QoS)
management and workflow composition.
3
Recently, while modeling workflows to support genetic processes, we realized that a
key aspect of workflows is to be able to anticipate their behavior prior to execution and
then characterize their behavior during execution, according to their quality of service.
Being able to carry out these two types of analysis allows organizations to better
understand their workflow processes and therefore foresee the quality of services
rendered to customers.
It is natural to think that if one of the most important goals of organizations is to
continuously seek to raise their competitive position – through the improvement of
services rendered to customers – workflow systems with quality of service support would
take their place in the market. We estimate (Sheth, Aalst et al. 1999) that the number of
readily available workflow systems is between 200 and 300; curiously, however, these
systems lack the support of a comprehensible and computable QoS model.
The gap between the type of WfMSs available on the market and the type of systems
actually needed reveals an interesting research problem. The workflow market offers a
broad spectrum of WfMSs, but somehow the systems do not match the requirements of
organizational managers. Tools and mechanisms that compute, estimate, and analyze
workflow QoS are not present. The first objective of this dissertation is to eliminate this
gap between technological supply and demand. The second area of research targets the
development of mechanisms that facilitate and assist users during the workflow design
process.
Emergent trading models, such as e-commerce, have evoked the development of
systems and infrastructures to support the concept of Web services. An organization’s
functionality is encapsulated with an appropriate interface and advertised as Web
services. While in some cases Web services may be utilized in an isolated form, it is
normal to expect Web services will be integrated as a part of workflows. The
composition of workflows that abstractly model e-commerce applications – such as
business-to-business, business-to-customer, and customer-to-customer processes – differs
4
from the design of traditional workflows. The main differences are in terms of the
number of tasks (Web services) available to the composition process, and in their
autonomy and heterogeneity. Therefore, two problems need to be solved: how to
efficiently discover Web services and how to facilitate hte interoperability of
heterogeneous Web services.
1.4 WORKFLOW QUALITY OF SERVICE
Organizations are constantly seeking new and innovative information systems to better
fulfill their mission and strategic goals. With the advent and evolution of globa-lscale
economies, organizations need to be more competitive, efficient, flexible, and integrated
in the value chain at different levels, including the information system level. In the past
decade, Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) have been distinguished by theri
significance and impact on organizations. WfMSs allow organizations to streamline and
automate business processes and reengineer their structure; in addition, they increase
efficiency and reduce costs.
Several researchers have identified workflows as the computing model that enables a
standard method of building Web services applications and processes to connect and
exchange information over the Web (Chen, Dayal et al. 2000; German Shegalov, Michael
Gillmann et al. 2001; Leymann 2001; Fensel and Bussler 2002). The new advances and
developments in e-services and Web services set new requirements and challenges for
workflow systems.
Our past research has involved the development of fully distributed enactment
services for workflow management. Our infrastructure, the METEOR system, and
specifically its OrbWork (Kochut, Sheth et al. 1999) and WebWork (Miller, Palaniswami
et al. 1998) enactment services have been used in prototyping and deploying applications
to various domains, such as bio-informatics (Hall, Miller et al. 2000), healthcare
5
(Anyanwu, Sheth et al. 1999), telecommunications (Luo 2000), the military (Kang,
Froscher et al. 1999), and university administration( CAPA 1997).
Our experience with real-world applications has made us aware that existing
workflow systems, both products and research prototypes, provide a set of indispensable
