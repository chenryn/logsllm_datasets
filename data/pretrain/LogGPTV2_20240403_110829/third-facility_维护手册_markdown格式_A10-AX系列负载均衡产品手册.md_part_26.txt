Clients Protocol that initiates this BFD session. It can be one or more of the following:
Static, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, or BGP.
Singlehop (or Multihop) BFD session can be either singlehop or multihop.
Echo Indicates whether Echo functionality has been enabled or disabled.

UDP source port UDP source port used for this BFD session.
Asynchronous mode (or Demand) If configured and running, indicates whether BFD is operating in Asynchronous
mode mode or Demand mode.

the following supported authentication schemes:
• Simple password
• Keyed MD5
• Meticulous Keyed MD5
• Keyed SHA1
• Meticulous Keyed SHA1
CPU ID Since BFD traffic is distributed across multiple data CPUs, this CPU ID refers to the
one associated with the current BFD session.

for debugging purposes
Local State Shows the local state the session. The state can be one of the following:
• Init
• Up
• AdminDown
• Down
Remote State Shows the remote state the session. The state can be one of the following:
• Init
• Up
• AdminDown
• Down
Local discriminator The local discriminator value that the ACOS device assigns for the current BFD ses-
sion.
Remote discriminator The remote discriminator value that the neighboring router claims.
Config The configured timer values.
Local The configured timer values sent in the last BFD control packet. This value is deter-
mined based on BFD package exchange and negotiation.
Remote The timer values received in the last BFD control packet from the BFD neighbor.

Field Description
Local Multiplier The local multiplier sent in the last BFD packet.
Remote Multiplier The remote multiplier received in the last BFD packet from the neighbor.
Hold Down Time The expiration time after which the BFD session will be brought down. This value is
determined with the negotiated interval value and the remote multiplier value.
Transmit Interval The periodic interval to send BFD control packets.
Local Diagnostic: The diagnostic value sent in the last BFD control packet.
Remote Diagnostic: The diagnostic value received in the last BFD control packet from the neighbor.
Last sent echo sequence number A10 Network’s proprietary sequence number sent in the last echo packet.

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
The following table describes the fields in the command output.
Field Description
IP Checksum error Number of BFD packets that had an invalid IP checksum.
UDP Checksum error Number of BFD packets that had an invalid UDP checksum.
No session found with your_discriminator Number of BFD packets whose Your Discriminator value did not match a
My Discriminator value on the ACOS device.
Multihop config mismatch A multihop configuration mismatch occurs when an ACOS device receives
a BFD packet with a source or destination that matches an existing BFD ses-
sion. It can also be caused in two other scenarios:
• Local is configured as singlehop, but the packet is received on the UDP
port for multihop.
• Local is configured as multihop, but packet is received on the UDP port
for singlehop.
BFD Version mismatch Number of BFD packets with a different BFD version than the one in use by
the ACOS device.
BFD Packet length field is too small Number of BFD packets whose Length field value was shorter than the min-
imum BFD packet length (24 bytes without authentication or 26 bytes with
authentication).
BFD Packet data is short The packet payload size is smaller than the BFD length value.
BFD Packet DetectMult is invalid The value of the received DetectMult is “0”.
BFD Packet Multipoint is invalid The value of the received multipoint flag is set to “1”.
BFD Packet my_discriminator is invalid Number of BFD packets whose My Discriminator value was invalid.
BFD Packet TTL/Hop Limit is invalid In a singlehop BFD session, the IP time-to-live or IPv6 hop limit value must
be 255. If a value other than 255 is detected, this field is incremented.
BFD Packet auth length is invalid The BFD length without the BFD packet header does not match the
expected authentication length byte value. The number of BFD control
packets have wrong authentication lengths in bytes
BFD Packet auth type mismatch Number of BFD packets carrying an authentication type that does not
match the BFD authentication type configured on the ACOS device.
BFD Packet auth key ID mismatch This field is incremented when the key ID in the authentication header does
not match the one configured on the ACOS device.
BFD Packet auth key mismatch This field is incremented when the received authentication key does not
match the one configured on the ACOS device.
BFD Packet auth seq# invalid This field is incremented when the received authentication sequence num-
ber is not equal to or greater than the sequence number received previ-
ously.
BFD Packet auth failed Number of BFD packets with an incorrect authentication value.
BFD local state is AdminDown Number of BFD packets received while the BFD session was administra-
tively down.

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Field Description
BFD Destination unreachable Number of times the destination IP address for a BFD neighbor was
unreachable while the ACOS device was attempting to transmit a BFD
packet to the neighbor.
BFD Other error Number of BFD errors not counted in any of the fields above.
show bgp

BGP” chapter in the Network Configuration Guide.
show bootimage
Description Display the software images stored on the ACOS device.
Syntax show bootimage
Mode All
Example The following command shows the software images on an A10 Thunder Series 4430 device:
ACOS#show bootimage

Version
-----------------------------------------------
Hard Disk primary 4.0.0.485
Hard Disk secondary 2.7.2-P2-SP6.1 (*)
Compact Flash primary 2.7.2.191 (*)
Compact Flash secondary 2.7.2.191
The asterisk ( * ) indicates the default image for each boot device (hard disk and compact
flash). The default image is the one that the ACOS device will try to use first, if trying to boot
from that boot device. (The order in which ACOS tries to use the image areas is controlled by
the bootimage command. See “bootimage” on page96.)
