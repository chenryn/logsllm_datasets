just a problem of installation:
  * I installed and using just Miniconda
  * how do I installed numpy: 
    1. conda update -y --all
    2. conda install -y numpy
  * my operating system is Windows 10 Enterprise 64bit
### Reproducing code example:
python -c "import numpy"
or in my program:
import numpy as np
### Error message:

IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!
Importing the numpy c-extensions failed.
  * Try uninstalling and reinstalling numpy.
  * If you have already done that, then:
    1. Check that you expected to use Python3.7 from "C:\Users\sulis\Miniconda3\python.exe",  
and that you have no directories in your PATH or PYTHONPATH that can  
interfere with the Python and numpy version "1.17.3" you're trying to use.
    2. If (1) looks fine, you can open a new issue at  
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues. Please include details on:
      * how you installed Python
      * how you installed numpy
      * your operating system
      * whether or not you have multiple versions of Python installed
      * if you built from source, your compiler versions and ideally a build log
  * If you're working with a numpy git repository, try `git clean -xdf`  
(removes all files not under version control) and rebuild numpy.
