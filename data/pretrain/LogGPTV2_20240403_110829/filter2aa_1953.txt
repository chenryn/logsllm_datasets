## Introduction
The convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) has created a new landscape in industrial cybersecurity. This presentation will explore the trends, challenges, and opportunities in the industrial cybersecurity space in 2020.

## Convergence of IT and OT
- **IT and OT Convergence:** The integration of IT and OT systems, including Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), has blurred the lines between traditional IT and OT environments.
- **Air-gapped OT Systems:** While air-gapped systems (physically isolated with no wireless or Ethernet connections) are rare, they do exist. However, modern factories often require connectivity for data collection and analysis, making them more vulnerable to cyber threats.

## Notable Cyber Attacks on ICS
- **Stuxnet (2010):** Targeted SCADA systems, causing physical damage.
- **Duqu (2011):** Collected information from industrial facilities.
- **Shamoon, Flamer, Gauss (2012):** Various malware targeting industrial systems.
- **Havex, Dragonfly (2013-2014):** Espionage and sabotage attacks on energy and manufacturing sectors.
- **BlackEnergy 3 (2015):** Caused power outages in Ukraine.
- **Industroyer (2016):** Another attack on Ukrainian power grid.
- **WannaCry, NotPetya, Bad Rabbit (2017-2018):** Ransomware attacks affecting multiple industries.
- **VPNFilter (2018):** Malware targeting routers and network devices.
- **LockerGoga, Ekans, DoppelPaymer (2019-2020):** Ransomware attacks specifically targeting industrial control systems (ICS).

## Threat Paradigm Shift in ICS
- **Evolving Cyber Attacks:** Manufacturers are increasingly targeted by sophisticated cyber attacks.
- **WannaCry (2017):** A non-targeted worm that propagated rapidly.
- **LockerGoga (2019):** A targeted attack using file encryption.
- **Snake/EKANS (2020):** A targeted attack that encrypts ICS-related files.
- **DoppelPaymer (2020):** A targeted attack involving file encryption and data exfiltration, with the capability to kill OT tasks.

## Case Studies
- **Ukraine Power Grid Attack (2015):**
  1. Spear phishing email with a malicious Microsoft document.
  2. BlackEnergy3 connects to Command and Control (C&C) server, stealing credentials.
  3. Remote access to ICS network using stolen VPN credentials.
  4. Manipulation of circuit breakers, causing power outages.
  5. Malicious firmware uploaded to serial-to-ethernet gateway devices.
  6. KillDisk malware used to erase master boot records.
  7. UPS systems exploited to cause further disruption.
  8. Telephone denial-of-service attack on call centers.

- **Ransomware Attacks (2019-2020):**
  - **Initial Access:** Through RDP/VPN, vulnerabilities, weak passwords, and brute force attacks.
  - **Persistence:** Compromising computers and servers, establishing C&C communication.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining AD server credentials.
  - **Payload Delivery:** Using HTTP, SMB, FTP, and Group Policy Objects (GPO).
  - **Execution and Infection:** Bypassing antivirus, executing ransomware, and demanding ransom.

## ICS Cyber Security Challenges
- **Threats and Attack Vectors:**
  - **Ransomware:** Targeted attacks leading to production outages.
  - **Worms:** Non-targeted attacks causing widespread disruption.
  - **PLC Misuse:** Targeted attacks on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).
  - **Insufficient Knowledge:** Lack of cybersecurity awareness and countermeasures in OT.
  - **No Visibility:** Limited visibility into connected devices and their management.
  - **No Tailored Solutions:** Use of IT-centric products for OT-specific issues.
  - **Legacy Liability:** Legacy systems hindering the deployment of cybersecurity measures.
  - **Pursuit of Productivity:** Prioritizing productivity over cybersecurity practices.

- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Non-Authenticated Control Commands**
  - **Unsecured Web Services**
  - **Native Device Backdoors**
  - **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities**

- **Cybersecurity Maturity:**
  - **NIST Cybersecurity Framework, IEC62443/ISA-99, NERC CIP:** Industry standards and best practices.
  - **Positive Correlation:** Company size, level of automation, and cyber capability.

## Defense Strategies
- **Security Defense in Enterprises:**
  - **User Environments:** Deploy Endpoint Protection and Detection (EPP/EDR) on all servers and PCs.
  - **Cloud Environments:** Secure public cloud workloads and DMZ.
  - **OT Shop Floor:**
    - **Perimeter Firewalls:** Secure the perimeter.
    - **ICS Detection Platform:** Identify vulnerable assets.
    - **Application Control:** Lock down legacy operating systems.
    - **Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV):** Protect modern equipment.

- **Remote Access:**
  - **Challenges:** Increased risks due to direct remote access, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  - **Solutions:** Indirect access through cloud services, enhanced authentication, and monitoring.

- **Service-Oriented Value Proposition:**
  - **Product:** 20% margin.
  - **Managed Services:** Ongoing maintenance, incident response, and forensics.
  - **Consulting Services:** Cybersecurity architecture and design services.

## Opportunities Beyond Uncertainty
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**
  - **Identify:** Discover and visualize ICS assets and networks.
  - **Protect:** Implement endpoint and network protection.
  - **Detect:** Monitor for anomalies and vulnerabilities.
  - **Respond:** Analyze and investigate incidents, remediate and mitigate.
  - **Recover:** Backup and restore operations.

- **Emerging Technologies:**
  - **Virtualization and Edge Computing:** Virtualized OT servers, workstations, and PLCs.
  - **Connectivity:** Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), 5G, and Wi-Fi 6 for reliable and high-bandwidth communication.

- **Operational Resilience Management:**
  - **Focus on ORM:** Beyond information-centric cybersecurity.
  - **Asset and Network Identification:** Shield vulnerable and critical assets.
  - **Network Segmentation:** Avoid production outages.
  - **OT Visibility:** Integrate OT visibility into SIEM/SOC.
  - **Expertise:** Hire internal or external experts.

## Conclusion
The industrial cybersecurity landscape in 2020 is characterized by the convergence of IT and OT, increasing sophistication of cyber threats, and the need for robust defense strategies. By focusing on operational resilience management, identifying and protecting critical assets, and leveraging emerging technologies, organizations can better secure their industrial control systems and ensure business continuity.
