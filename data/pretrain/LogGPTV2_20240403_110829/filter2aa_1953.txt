Foiled Conspiracy
1. Launch an DDoS attack against 
Tesla in order to preoccupy the 
company’s security staff 
2. Utilize malware to exfiltrate data 
for further ransom
• No wireless, no Bluetooth
• No connection (ethernet)
• Physical Isolation (six walls)
• All software/hardware tested BEFORE installing
• Data only passed by personal means, USB, CD, DVD
== Your business does not need to 
optimize production
Air-gapped OT is actually

1. Spear phishing e-mail with a
Microsoft document containing a
macro that installs BlackEnergy3
2. BlackEnergy3 connects to 
C&C, and hacker steals
credentials from business 
network 
3. Remote access from business network
to ICS network with VPN credentials
4. Use existing remote 
access tools (simulate 
operator HMI) to
command over 50
remote stations and
manipulate circuit 
breaker within 30
minutes (power 
outage)
5. Upload malicious firmware to the serial-
to-ethernet gateway devices (Moxa and iRZ)
8. Telephone denial-of-
service attack on the 
call center
6. Use modified KillDisk malware to erase the master boot 
record of impacted organization systems (Windows/Linux),
include Windows-based RTU
7. Utilizing UPS systems to impact connected 
load with a scheduled service outage

Gov’s works
§ Customers’ requests in real-time data 
visibility would uplift the OT infrastructure
§ Cybersecurity is becoming a highlighted 
issue in supply chain management. i.e, NIST 
CSF
§ Certificate of Origin
§ State-Sponsored > Profit-Driven
§ AD server compromising + Ransomware 
§ Intention? Pay or Not?
§ OT is pretty much a black box
§ IT Defense:
Semiconductor > LCD Panel > EMS = PCB > Others
§ IT runs OT security >>> OT runs OT security
§ 经济部工业局资安旗舰计画
§ ITRI: SecPaas (cybersecurity as a platform) 
coaches ICS users, provides pentest and

vendors to the users to lower the barrier.

ICS Detection Platform
• For startups founded 5 years ago, the target 
use case was an ICS Intrusion Detection System
• But OT was not quite ready then and therefore 
many firms pivoted to Asset Visibility and 
Management
• Firms MUST have dedicated resources for 
monitoring
• Accenture (at S4x20) estimated the annual 
cost of ICS Detection at
………
1.7M

Remote Access – COVID makes it worse  
”Direct Remote Access” is risky
•
Vulnerability of VPN and RDP gateways
•
Weak Authentication of VPN and RDP 
•
Loss of visibility through VPN
•
Loss of control through RDP
•
For Customer (and Boss):
Wants to know the utilization, progress, and even recipes and parameters in real-time
•
For Equipment vendor:
Cannot send technician to do on-site support and need remote access and control

Before

We are still in the very Beginning 
• OT is being weaponized 
with IT technologies
• But they have different 
capability, capacity, and 
maturity of IT 
technology
• The journey of OT Cyber 
just starts
COMPUTING
CONNECTIVITY
Virtualization, Private Cloud, and Edge Computing
§ Imagine in addition to OT servers, all 
workstations and PLCs will be virtualized 
and running on COTS hardware
§ Edge Cloud
Time-Sensitive Network (TSN), 5G, Wifi6
Remotely controlling
•High Bandwidth (5G eMBB)
•Low Latency (5G URLLC)
Communication inside the 
digital factory
•Wifi6
Time-critical, reliable 
process optimization
•Low Latency - TSN
Cost-saving for outdoor 
connectivity
•High Coverage – 5G mMTC
Perfect Storm for OT Cybersecurity
Digitalization
Hackers aim
at OT and ICS
OT is NOT well 
prepared
• OT is NOT air-gapped anymore as 
enterprises are collecting data for 
cloud analysis (IIoT)
• Industry 4.0, 5G, AI/ML, Edge 
Computing, Digital Twin
• From 2017, OT has suffered from 
both non-targeted and targeted 
attacks
• Hackers are aware of OT 
weaknesses and target 
accordingly
• Technology of the dark side is also 
evolving and more impactful
• Limited number of experts who 
understand both OT and 
cybersecurity
• Lack of OT-specific products and 
playbooks
If you are in charge of OT 
cybersecurity:
• Focus on Operational Resilience 
Management
• Identify your assets and network
• Shield vulnerable and critical assets, 
and implement network segmentation 
to avoid production outage
• Adding OT visibility into the SIEM/SOC
• Hire experts (internal or external)
