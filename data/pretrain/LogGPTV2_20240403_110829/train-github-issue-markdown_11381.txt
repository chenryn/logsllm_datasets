My app forms utilize the enter button to tab to specified fields for speed on
a ten-key keyboard. When enter is hit, we do a DOM lookup and trigger focus()
on the next element. This works great on text fields but I cannot understand
how to accomplish this on a Select box. I can get each of the DOM elements
that make up the Select structure, but triggering focus() at any level does
nothing.  
Note: I am able to grab the ref of the item via inputRef on the select to
prevent us from traversing the DOM but it still yields no results.  
Thank you in advance for any guidance!

## Expected Behavior
Select becomes focused (but not open) when focus() is triggered manually.
Expect the same behavior as hitting on the preceding element.
## Current Behavior
Triggering node.focus() does nothing, nor does it trigger on any element
within the select DOM structure.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)

  1. Select first text box.
  2. Hit Enter key.
  3. Notice 2nd text box is focused FTW.
  4. Hit Enter key again.
  5. Nothing happens.
