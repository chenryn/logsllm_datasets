Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
In Chrome, using `event.preventDefault()` and/or
`event.nativeEvent.preventDefault()` within `onWheel` handler of an
`input[type=number]` does not prevent number scrolling.

**What is the expected behavior?**
I would expect the same behaviour as shown in the HTML & JS example above.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
Tested in `react@16.8.5`, `react-dom@16.8.5` and Chrome v73. I'm unsure if
previous versions are affected.
