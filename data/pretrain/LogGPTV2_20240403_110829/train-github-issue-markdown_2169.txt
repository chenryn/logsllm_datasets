In the current main branch, the `ci/circleci: refguide_check` job has encountered issues in the `scipy.sparse.linalg.svds` function. Below are the details of the failed tests and their expected versus actual results:

### Failed Test 1
**Location:**
- File: `build-install/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scipy/sparse/linalg/_eigen/_svds.py`
- Line: 280

**Failed Example:**
```python
s_a(u2[:, :1], u[:, :1]) + s_a(u2[:, 1:], u[:, 1:]) > 1e-3
```

**Expected Result:**
```python
True
```

**Actual Result:**
```python
array([False])
```

### Failed Test 2
**Location:**
- File: `build-install/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scipy/sparse/linalg/_eigen/_svds.py`
- Line: 283

**Failed Example:**
```python
(s_a(vT2[:1, :].T, vT[:1, :].T) +
 s_a(vT2[1:, :].T, vT[1:, :].T)) > 1e-3
```

**Expected Result:**
```python
True
```

**Actual Result:**
```python
array([False])
```

### Error Summary
The reference guide or doctests have errors. Both failures appear to be potential marginal tolerance violations. A similar issue was previously reported as #16900.

This information should help in diagnosing and addressing the test failures.
