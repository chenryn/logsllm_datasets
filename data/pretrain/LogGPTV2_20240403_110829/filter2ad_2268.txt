ABSTRACT
Private information retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic primi-
tive that facilitates the seemingly impossible task of letting
users fetch records from untrusted and remote database servers
without revealing to those servers which records are being
fetched. The research literature on PIR is vast; in the over
two decades since its 1995 introduction by Chor, Goldreich,
Kushilevitz, and Sudan, the cryptography, privacy, and theo-
retical computer science research communities have studied
PIR intensively and from a variety of perspectives. Alas, de-
spite a series of significant advances, most privacy practition-
ers and theoreticians alike fall into one of two camps: (i) those
who believe that PIR is so inefficient and abstruse as to make
it all-but-useless in practice, or (ii) those who remain bliss-
fully unaware that PIR even exists. Indeed, to date not even
one of the numerous PIR-based applications proposed in the
research literature has been deployed at scale to protect the
privacy of users “in the wild”.
This tutorial targets both of the above camps, presenting a
bird’s-eye overview of the current state of PIR research. Top-
ics covered will span the spectrum from purely theoretical
through imminently applicable and all the high points in be-
tween, thereby providing participants with an awareness of
what modern PIR techniques have (and do not have) to of-
fer, dispelling the myth of PIR’s inherent impracticality, and
hopefully inspiring participants to identify practical use cases
for PIR within their own niche areas of expertise. This intro-
ductory tutorial will be accessible to anyone comfortable with
college-level mathematics (basic linear algebra and some ele-
mentary probability and number theory).

DESCRIPTION OF TUTORIAL
This tutorial provides participants with a broad overview of
the current state-of-the-art with respect to a cryptographic
primitive called private information retrieval (PIR). Informa-
tion retrieval (IR)—roughly, the activity of locating and re-
trieving relevant information from a corpus (i.e., database)
D of files or records—is among the most fundamental and
ubiquitous tasks in computing. In “classical” IR settings, a
client encodes its information needs in a query q, while the
holder of D (whether a remote server or a service running on
the client’s local host) ranks the elements of D by relevance
to the client’s needs as expressed in q, and then it returns to
the client one or more of the “top” matches.
PIR extends the classical IR setting with an interesting
twist: it insists that the holder of D learns nothing about the
information needs expressed in q (including the ranking it
induces and the matches it returns). While intuition might
insist that it is clearly not possible to realize such privacy for
IR, the research literature contains numerous PIR protocols
that do just that (albeit only for some very basic forms of
IR), with known constructions based on information- and
coding-theoretic primitives (e.g., secret sharing [3, 4] and
error-correcting codes [9]), both public- and private-key en-
cryption (e.g., partially homomorphic encryption [7] and
function secret sharing [1, 11], anonymity [6, 10], and trusted
hardware (e.g., TPMs [12] and SGX). As for what types of
IR can be realized as PIR, the literature considers PIR con-
structions supporting physical position-based queries [3],
keyword-based queries [2], simple SQL-based queries [8],
statistical queries [11], and index-based queries [5].
Yet despite the ubiquity of IR, the ever-increasing quan-
tity and sensitivity of information being digitized and made
available online, and the veritable wealth of PIR techniques
in the literature, PIR has never been deployed at scale to protect
the privacy of users “in the wild”. This tutorial sets out with
the lofty goal of changing that. It will cover topics spanning
the spectrum from purely theoretical through imminently
applicable and all the high points in between, thereby pro-
viding participants with an awareness of what modern PIR
techniques have (and do not have) to offer, dispelling the
myth of PIR’s inherent impracticality, and hopefully inspir-
ing participants to identify practical use cases for PIR within
their own niche areas of expertise.

The duration of the tutorial will be three hours, with each
hour being devoted to a different “module” about PIR.
The first half-hour will motivate the PIR problem, illus-
trating why widely deployed primitives (like encryption and
anonymous communications) cannot be relied upon to solve
many, or even most, IR-based privacy problems. Following
this, the second half-hour will be devoted to formally defin-
ing PIR as a cryptographic primitive, using the so-called
“trivial PIR” protocol as an ideal (from a privacy perspective)
yet impractical reference against which to base the defini-
tions. Throughout the development of formal PIR definitions,
participants will learn about some of the fundamental possi-
bility and impossibility results these definitions imply. We
will also take this opportunity to clarify the relationships
PIR has to oblivious transfer (OT), oblivious RAM (ORAM),
and secure multiparty computation (MPC).
The second hour will consist of a discussion about all of the
major “flavours” of PIR in the research literature, including
information-theoretic PIR (IT-PIR), computational PIR (C-
PIR), function secret sharing-based PIR (FSS-PIR), anonymity-
based PIR (A-PIR), trusted hardware-based PIR (TH-PIR),
and various hybrids thereof. Throughout this discussion,
participants will learn about the high-level idea underlying
each flavour of PIR as well as their inherent strengths and
weaknesses. In addition, we will walk through low-level
details for a handful of representative PIR protocols.
The final hour will focus on a hodge-podge of practical con-
siderations like Byzantine robustness, techniques for “batch-
ing” queries or batch-coding databases, how to realize expres-
sive query types (e.g., keyword-, SQL-, and index-based PIR
queries) or advanced functionality (e.g., ACLs and pricing)
atop basic PIR, and open-source implementations.
INTENDED AUDIENCE
This tutorial is intended for a broad audience, including re-
searchers and practitioners from academia, government, and
industry. The material covered focuses primarily on techni-
cal aspects of PIR and will be most accessible to computer
scientists and software developers—the tutorial will not ad-
dress legal, ethical, sociological, or economic considerations;
nonetheless, social scientists and policymakers are welcome
and encouraged to participate.
Prerequisite knowledge: This is an introductory level
tutorial and will be accessible to anyone comfortable with
college-level mathematics (specifically, basic linear algebra
and some elementary probability and number theory). It
does not assume any prior knowledge about PIR or other
advanced cryptographic primitives, although participants
having some familiarity with cryptographic definitions and
hardness assumptions will find a few of the “deep-dive” topics
easier to grok.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH
Ryan Henry is an assistant professor in the computer sci-
ence department at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indi-
ana. His research explores the systems challenges of applied
cryptography, with an emphasis on using cryptography to
build secure systems that preserve the privacy of their users.
In addition to designing and analyzing privacy-enhancing
systems, Professor Henry is interested in practical matters
like implementing and working toward the deployment of
such systems, as well as more theoretical matters like devis-
ing number-theoretic attacks against non-standard crypto-
graphic assumptions and developing new models and theo-
ries to understand just how efficient “heavy-weight” cryp-
tographic primitives can be. He received his MMath (2010)
and Ph.D. (2014) from the University of Waterloo, where he
held a Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship (Vanier CGS),
the most prestigious graduate scholarship in Canada. He
has published several papers on PIR at top research venues
(e.g., CCS, NDSS, and PETS), is a contributor to Percy++
(an open-source implementation of PIR protocols in C++),
and two of his three active NSF grants heavily involve PIR
research.
