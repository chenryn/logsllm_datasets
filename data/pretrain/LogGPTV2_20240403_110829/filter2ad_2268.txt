## Abstract
Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic primitive that enables users to fetch records from untrusted and remote database servers without revealing which records are being accessed. Since its introduction in 1995 by Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz, and Sudan, PIR has been extensively studied by the cryptography, privacy, and theoretical computer science communities. Despite significant advancements, PIR remains largely underutilized, with many practitioners and researchers either considering it impractical or unaware of its existence. To date, no PIR-based application has been deployed at scale to protect user privacy in real-world settings.

This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of PIR research. It will cover topics ranging from purely theoretical to practically applicable, dispelling the myth of PIR's inherent impracticality and inspiring participants to identify practical use cases within their own fields. The tutorial is accessible to anyone with a college-level understanding of mathematics, including basic linear algebra and elementary probability and number theory.

## Description of Tutorial
This tutorial provides a broad overview of the current state-of-the-art in private information retrieval (PIR). Information retrieval (IR) is a fundamental and ubiquitous task in computing, where a client queries a database to retrieve relevant information. In classical IR, the client's query and the returned results are known to the database holder. PIR extends this by ensuring that the database holder learns nothing about the client's query or the retrieved data.

The literature on PIR includes numerous protocols based on various cryptographic and coding-theoretic primitives, such as secret sharing, error-correcting codes, partially homomorphic encryption, and trusted hardware. PIR supports various types of queries, including physical position-based, keyword-based, SQL-based, statistical, and index-based queries.

Despite the wealth of PIR techniques, none have been widely deployed. This tutorial aims to change that by covering a wide range of topics, from theoretical foundations to practical applications, and by dispelling the myth of PIR's impracticality. It will inspire participants to identify practical use cases for PIR in their areas of expertise.

## Scope of Tutorial
The tutorial will span three hours, divided into three modules:

1. **Motivation and Definitions (First Hour)**
   - Motivation: Why traditional methods like encryption and anonymous communications are insufficient for many IR-based privacy problems.
   - Formal Definition: Introduction to PIR using the "trivial PIR" protocol as a reference. Discussion of fundamental possibility and impossibility results, and the relationships between PIR, oblivious transfer (OT), oblivious RAM (ORAM), and secure multiparty computation (MPC).

2. **Types of PIR (Second Hour)**
   - Overview of major PIR types: Information-theoretic PIR (IT-PIR), computational PIR (C-PIR), function secret sharing-based PIR (FSS-PIR), anonymity-based PIR (A-PIR), and trusted hardware-based PIR (TH-PIR).
   - High-level ideas, strengths, and weaknesses of each type. Detailed walkthrough of representative PIR protocols.

3. **Practical Considerations (Third Hour)**
   - Practical aspects such as Byzantine robustness, batching queries, batch-coding databases, expressive query types, advanced functionality (e.g., ACLs and pricing), and open-source implementations.

## Intended Audience
This tutorial is designed for a broad audience, including researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry. It focuses on the technical aspects of PIR and is most accessible to computer scientists and software developers. While it does not address legal, ethical, sociological, or economic considerations, social scientists and policymakers are welcome to participate.

**Prerequisite Knowledge:**
- College-level mathematics, specifically basic linear algebra and some elementary probability and number theory.
- No prior knowledge of PIR or advanced cryptographic primitives is required, though familiarity with cryptographic definitions and hardness assumptions will be beneficial.
