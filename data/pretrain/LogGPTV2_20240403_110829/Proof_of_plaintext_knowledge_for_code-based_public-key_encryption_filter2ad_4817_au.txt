### Achieving Adaptive Security

In this section, we demonstrate that the Multi-Input Functional Encryption (MIFE) scheme from Figure 4.6 is many-AD-IND-static secure under the Dk(p)-MDDH assumption in groups G1 and G2. This means our scheme remains secure even when the adversary adaptively chooses multiple challenge ciphertexts and handles static corruptions of input slots (see Definition 23).

#### Security Proof

The security proof is structured into two main steps, similar to the many-SEL-IND security proof in Section 4.1.

1. **One-AD-IND-Static Security:**
   - We first prove in Theorem 11 that the MIFE scheme in Figure 4.6 is one-AD-IND-static secure. This means it is adaptively secure when there is only a single challenge ciphertext and can handle static corruptions of input slots.

2. **Many-AD-IND-Static Security:**
   - Using Theorem 10, which states that if an FE scheme is many-yy-IND secure and an MIFE scheme is one-yy-IND secure, then the MIFE scheme is many-yy-IND secure, along with Theorem 11 (one-AD-IND security of MIFE) and the many-AD-IND security of the underlying FE (proven in Theorem 4), we establish the many-AD-IND security of MIFE (Corollary 3).

#### Theorem 11: One-AD-IND-Static Security of MIFE

**Statement:**
Suppose the Dk(p)-MDDH assumption holds in G1 and G2. Then, the multi-input functional encryption scheme in Figure 4.6 is one-AD-IND-static secure.

**Proof:**
We show that our multi-input functional encryption scheme is adaptively secure when there is only a single challenge ciphertext. The proof involves a series of games, as illustrated in Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.8.

1. **Game G0,β:**
   - This game is the original security game where the challenge ciphertext is either \( c_0 \) or \( c_1 \) based on the bit \( \beta \). The advantage of an adversary A in this game is given by:
     \[
     \text{Adv}_{\text{MIFE},A}^{\text{one-AD-IND-static}}(\lambda) = | \text{Adv}_{G0,0}(A) - \text{Adv}_{G0,1}(A) |
     \]

2. **Game G1,β:**
   - In this game, we change the distribution of the vectors \([c_i]_1\) computed by the encryption oracle using the Dk(p)-MDDH assumption. Specifically, we show that there exists a PPT adversary B1,β such that:
     \[
     \text{Adv}_{G0,β}(A) - \text{Adv}_{G1,β}(A) \leq \text{Adv}_{\text{Dk(p)-mddh}}^{G1,B1,β}(\lambda) + \frac{1}{p}
     \]

3. **Game G2,β:**
   - Here, we modify the way the vectors \([c''_i]_1\) and \([d_i]_2\) are computed by the encryption and key generation oracles, respectively, using an information-theoretic argument. This step ensures that the game can be simulated without knowing \([z_i]_1\). We show that:
     \[
     \text{Adv}_{G1,β}(A) = \text{Adv}_{G2,β}(A)
     \]

4. **Game G3,β:**
   - In this game, we use the Dk(p)-MDDH assumption to switch the values \([h(z_i, r)]_2\) computed by the key generation oracle to uniformly random values over G2 for all honest input slots \( i \in HS \). We show that there exists a PPT adversary B3,β such that:
     \[
     \text{Adv}_{G2,β}(A) - \text{Adv}_{G3,β}(A) \leq \text{Adv}_{\text{Uk-mddh}}^{G2,B3,β}(\lambda) + \frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{p}
     \]

5. **Selective Variant Game G⋆3,β:**
   - Finally, we consider the selective variant of game G3,β, where the adversary must commit to its challenge \((x^0_i, x^1_i)_{i \in HS}\) before receiving the public key or making any decryption key queries. By a guessing argument, we show that there exists a PPT adversary A⋆ such that:
     \[
     \text{Adv}_{G3,β}(A) = (X + 1)^{2hm} \cdot \text{Adv}_{G⋆3,β}(A⋆)
     \]

By showing that \(\text{Adv}_{G3,0}(A) = \text{Adv}_{G3,1}(A)\), we conclude that the MIFE scheme is one-AD-IND-static secure.

#### Corollary 3: Many-AD-IND-Static Security of MIFE

**Statement:**
Suppose the Dk(p)-MDDH assumption holds in G1 and G2. Then, the multi-input functional encryption scheme in Figure 4.6 is many-AD-IND-static secure.

**Proof:**
This follows directly from Theorem 10, Theorem 11, and the many-AD-IND security of the underlying FE (Theorem 4).

### Conclusion

We have shown that the MIFE scheme from Figure 4.6 is many-AD-IND-static secure under the Dk(p)-MDDH assumption in G1 and G2, ensuring its robustness against adaptive adversaries and static corruptions.
