User: Please analyze the common security vulnerabilities and attack methods in the production environment, and provide solutions and preventive measures.
Assistant: Common security holes and attack methods are as follows: 1. SQL injection attack: The attacker obtains or modifies data in the database, or even executes malicious code, by injecting malicious SQL statements into input parameters. The solution is to use prepared statements in your code, or do strict format validation and filtering on input parameters. 2. Cross-site scripting attack (XSS): The attacker injects malicious scripts into the page to obtain sensitive information of users or perform malicious operations. Precautions are strict filtering and validation of user-entered data, as well as secure coding to prevent script injection. 3. CSRF attack: The attacker forges the user's request to achieve malicious operations, such as transfer, shopping, etc. The preventive measure is to add a token verification to each request, or use verification codes and other methods for secondary verification. 4. Code injection attack: The attacker executes the attack by injecting malicious code into the program. A precautionary measure is to adopt safe programming practices to prevent direct execution of program code by external input. 5. DOS attack: The attacker sends a large number of meaningless requests to the server, causing the server to be paralyzed. The preventive measure is to use CDN, firewall and other technologies for traffic control. 6. Information leakage: Some sensitive information is easily stolen by attackers during transmission or storage. Precautions are the use of encrypted data transfers and strict control over access to sensitive information. 7. File upload vulnerability: Attackers attack the server by uploading malicious files. The preventive measures are to filter the uploaded file types, and to properly process and store the uploaded files. In short, to ensure the security of the system, a variety of technologies and means must be adopted, including comprehensive consideration and processing of network security, data security, application security, and user security.
