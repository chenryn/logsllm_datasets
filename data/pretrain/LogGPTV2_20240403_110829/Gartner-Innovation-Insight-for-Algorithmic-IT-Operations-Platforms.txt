### Gartner Report: Innovation Insight for Algorithmic IT Operations Platforms

**Published:** 24 March 2016  
**Analyst(s):** Colin Fletcher  
**ID:** G00296380

#### Summary
Algorithmic IT operations (AIOps) platforms empower IT and operations (I&O) leaders to meet the proactive, personalized, and dynamic demands of digital business. These platforms transform the nature of IT operations work by providing unprecedented, automated insights.

#### Overview
**Key Findings:**
- **Human Limitations:** Human capabilities, deductive reasoning, and limited data analysis capacity are constraining IT operations from achieving the agility and insight required to support digital business initiatives.
- **Strategic Investment:** Current and future I&O demands require a strategic investment in a platform designed to collect and analyze data from any source with the assistance of increasingly intelligent machines.
- **Tactical Investments:** To date, most I&O investments in AIOps platform technologies (IT operations analytics, big data, machine learning, etc.) have been tactical and isolated, limiting their potential.
- **Skill Gap:** Most I&O teams lack the skills and experience needed to effectively utilize AIOps platforms.

**Recommendations:**
- **Strategic Investment:** Invest in an AIOps platform that supports major IT operations functions such as monitoring, automation, and service desk.
- **Balance Ease and Interchangeability:** Balance ease of use with the interchangeability of platform capabilities (data collection, storage, analytical engines, presentation, etc.) to avoid vendor lock-in.
- **Skill Development:** Invest in building the necessary skills and making organizational changes to derive value from an AIOps platform.

**Strategic Planning Assumption:**
By 2019, 25% of global enterprises will have strategically implemented an AIOps platform that supports two or more major IT operations functions, up from fewer than 5% today.

#### Analysis
For too long, IT operations management (ITOM) has relied on "small data" tactics and tools to manage "big data" challenges. Meeting current and future ITOM demands requires leveraging advanced analytical technologies used in high-demand business applications (e.g., fraud detection) and consumer experiences (e.g., content delivery, social media). This necessitates a shift towards a data-driven, algorithmic, collaborative, and experimental approach to ITOM. AIOps platforms enable real-time and historical analysis of data from any source, assisted by machines, representing a radical change and significant opportunity.

**Definition:**
AIOps platforms use big data, modern machine learning, and other advanced analytics technologies to enhance IT operations functions (monitoring, automation, service desk) with proactive, personalized, and dynamic insights. They support multiple data sources, collection methods, analytical technologies, and presentation technologies (see Figure 1).

**Logical Architecture:**
AIOps platforms consist of loosely coupled layers addressing data collection and storage, analytical engines (real-time and deep), visualization/UI, and integration with other applications via APIs (see Figure 2).

- **Presentation Layer:** Supports multiple presentation and interaction methods, including visualization and natural-language processing (NLP).
- **Analytical Learning Layer:** Supports both deep analytical capabilities (e.g., deep neural networks) and real-time analytical capabilities (e.g., time series metric data).
- **Data Storage:** Often supported by non-relational data stores (e.g., MongoDB) and highly distributed data processing systems (e.g., Hadoop).
- **Data Collection:** Performed via machine data forwarding, data streaming, or API integrations from other tools.

**Data Sources:**
- Natively generated by IT infrastructure and applications (e.g., logs, packets)
- Generated by application development and DevOps tools (e.g., CI/CD, source code management)
- Collected or generated by ITOM tools (e.g., agents, automation artifacts)
- Collected or generated by identity and access management tools, line-of-business applications, social media, and IoT devices
- Syndicated content from public and private external knowledge providers

**Benefits and Uses:**
AIOps platforms provide advanced analytical capabilities to multiple IT operations disciplines, offering proactive insights through automated, algorithmic learning. These insights assist and augment human capabilities, supporting various skill levels and encouraging adoption across a wide range of use cases.
