which collect and parse WHOIS data at scale. For instance,
WHOIS records of 102M domains were crawled by [70] and
the full WHOIS dataset from DomainTools is used by a study
in 2020 [63]. Regarding data analysis, the WHOIS dataset is
provided to us for research purposes only, and we execute all
programs on the servers of the industrial partner. During our
study, the WHOIS records in the dataset are never shared with
third parties. We also consulted professional lawyers about
legal issues of analyzing EEA records and are notiﬁed that it
does not violate the GDPR regulations. As our data processing
is for research purpose only, with no relation to offering goods
or services to EU citizens, analyzing WHOIS data is allowed
according to Recital 23 [3] of the GDPR.
IV. WHOIS PROVIDERS WITH
LARGE NUMBER OF EEA DOMAINS
In this section, we study the WHOIS providers maintaining
a large number of EEA domains. We run GCChecker on the
weekly data to carry out macro-level (e.g., how they comply
with the GDPR in general) and micro-level analysis (e.g., how
they mask the WHOIS records).
A. WHOIS Provider Selection
We use the number of EEA records observed in our dataset
per week to select qualiﬁed providers for this measurement
task. In particular, we count the number of weeks where over
50 EEA records (i.e., 2× min_samples) are collected for a
provider, and choose the providers whose week numbers are
over 90 (i.e., 90% of all weeks). This selection method ensures
our clustering method can be executed without change and
sufﬁcient weeks can be measured. In total, 89 registrars and
54 registries meet the criteria, and Table IV shows a subset.
According to ICANN’s reports, the selected registrars sponsor
63.08% of all registered domain names (see Appendix A for
details of registrar domain share). For registries, as ICANN
do not report their share, we show the number of sponsoring
TLDs in our dataset. Note that leading registries like VeriSign
(managing .com and .net) are not included because their
managed TLDs use “thin WHOIS” and are thus not queried by
our industrial partner. As the selected WHOIS providers offer
services to EEA registrants, we consider them to be under the
scope of the GDPR and ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation.
B. Status of GDPR Compliance
For each WHOIS provider, we apply GCChecker on the
WHOIS strings under the registrant contact of EEA domains
to obtain their weekly outlier ratios and their compliance
categories (i.e., “fully”, “partially” or “not”). We neglect tech
and admin contact as we ﬁnd the trends are similar.

TABLE IV: GDPR compliance analysis results of WHOIS providers with large number of EEA domains (2018-2019)
Observation 1: The enforcement of the GDPR has profound
impact on WHOIS data release: over 85% large WHOIS
providers we studied are now GDPR-compliant.
Observation 2: Not all registries are fully GDPR-compliant
as of Dec 2019.
Table IV presents the detailed clustering results of the top
WHOIS providers. In total, 124 (86.7% of 143) providers
are classiﬁed as fully-compliant, including 73 registrars and
51 registries. In Sections IV-C and IV-D we will further
investigate their time of GDPR compliance and protection
measures. Meanwhile, 9 (6.3% of 143) providers are classiﬁed
as partially-compliant and the remaining 10 (7.0% of 143)
providers are classiﬁed as not compliant.
Though registries are supposed to be fully-compliant as it
works closely with ICANN, surprisingly, we ﬁnd 3 exceptions.
Two registries (NeuStar, Inc. and Fundacio PuntCAT) of two
TLDs (.us and .cat) are classiﬁed as not compliant and over
90% of their WHOIS records are outliers. .us is a particularly
interesting case. According to a decision by the US National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
in 2005, the information of .us domain holders should not be
kept private [74]. On the other hand, we believe the decision

data protection in time before the GDPR went effective. 11
providers (e.g., ID-1659 Uniregistrar Corp) show a delayed
compliance of more than one month, i.e., later than Jun 2018.
When taking a closer look at the timeline around GDPR
compliance, we ﬁnd that prominent actions were taken after
the adoption of the ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation on 17
May 2018 for most providers. In other words, data masking
is performed within only one week. Before 17 May 2018,
we only ﬁnd 2 registrars (ID-1001 Domeneshop AS dba
domainnameshop.com and ID-1666 OpenTLD B.V.) taking
measures at scale. This ﬁnding resonates with a previous study
on web privacy showing that over 70% privacy policy changes
happened close to the GDPR effective date [42].
Though there is a 2-year grace period for organizations
to prepare for the GDPR, it still takes nearly 2 years for
registrars and registries to take necessary actions at scale. We
discussed our observation with a large international registrar
and learned that WHOIS providers prefer to wait until the
ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation was released due to a void
of speciﬁc guidance. Moreover, as the speciﬁcation only left
one week for the providers to make changes before the GDPR
effective date, they tend to choose simplistic data masking
strategies, resulting in changes beyond EEA records (further
discussed in Observation 6).
D. Data Protection Measures
information can be either
As shown in Table I, the ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation
includes guidance on contact masking (for ﬁelds other than
email address) and email anonymization. To understand how
WHOIS providers follow the guidance, we inspect the clusters
of WHOIS records of the GDPR-compliant providers and
characterize their types of measures.
Contact masking. The ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation sug-
gests that contact
redacted or
ﬁlled with an empty value. In practice, this suggestion is
widely adopted by WHOIS providers: 46 registrars (e.g., ID-
69 Tucows Domains Inc.) and 12 registries (e.g. .vip and
.amsterdam registries) use redacted values; 24 registrars
(e.g., ID-146 GoDaddy.com, LLC) and 39 registries (e.g.,
.org and .site registries) use empty values. Below are
examples of redacted values used by WHOIS providers:
● “redacted for privacy” (e.g., ID-69 Tucows Domains Inc.)
● “statutory masking enabled” (e.g., ID-2 Network Solu-
● “non-public data” (e.g., ID-625 Name.com, Inc.)
● “not disclosed” (e.g., ID-1505 Gransy, s.r.o.)
● “redacted” (e.g., .wien Registry)
tions, LLC)
Besides, WHOIS privacy protection services are also lever-
aged by registrars for contact masking. In this case, real
registrant information is replaced with the name and address
of the information of the service. While typically the services
are paid, we ﬁnd that they are made free by some registrars in
response to the GDPR (e.g., WhoisGuard [15]). By identifying
a small set of keywords (e.g., “privacy” and “protected”), we
ﬁnd 13 registrars mask a portion of records, and 3 registrars
(e.g., ID-1456 NetArt Registrar Sp. z o.o.) mask all records
using WHOIS privacy services to comply with the GDPR.

of NTIA should be revisited since .us does offer registration
services to EEA residents, who are protected by the GDPR.
One registry (Aﬁlias, Inc.) is classiﬁed as partially-compliant.
We ﬁnd that the domain outliers are all under the .srl TLD,
while other WHOIS records are protected.
Observation 3: While most registrars are striving to protect
their domains, ﬂawed implementations are discovered.
By manually inspecting the outlying records, we ﬁnd some
providers do not mask all contact ﬁelds required by the ICANN
Temporary Speciﬁcation. For instance, we ﬁnd that 4 registrars
(ID-2487, ID-447, ID-1011 and ID-1564) do not protect the
address ﬁelds (i.e., Registrant Street, City and Postal Code).
For around 10% domains sponsored by ID-81 and ID-1725,
only the email address ﬁeld is masked. We recommend the
providers to update their data protection policies.
While we pinpoint the root causes of compliance failure
of 6 providers, we are not able to identify obvious reasons
for the remaining ones solely from WHOIS data. We have
been reporting the issue to the providers. In the feedback
from NameCheap and NameSilo,
their explanation is that
registrants opt-in to display their WHOIS information (e.g.,
through email veriﬁcation). In the feedback from Gandi, the
unprotected information comes from registrants who chose
to opt-out the default privacy protection service before the
GDPR went effective, and their choice is respected. To help
WHOIS providers address this issue, we also implement an
online tool to check their current status of GDPR compliance,
leveraging some building blocks of GCChecker (described in
Section VII).
C. Timeline of GDPR Compliance
Observation 4: Over 80% large GDPR-compliant WHOIS
providers complete data protection timely before the GDPR
went effective (on 25 May 2018), but they waited to take
actions after the adoption of the ICANN Temporary Speci-
ﬁcation (on 17 May 2018).
Figure 7 shows the weekly outlier ratio of 124 GDPR-
compliant WHOIS providers altogether. Around the GDPR
effective date (25 May 2018) we observe a signiﬁcant drop
in the outlier ratio of most providers, suggesting that large-
scale data masking is performed. To quantify this change, for
each provider we use the ﬁrst week where the outlier ratio
drops below 0.05 as the starting time of compliance. As a
result, 100 (80.6% of 124) WHOIS providers completed their

Observation 5: Though most GDPR-compliant registrars
offer direct communication channels to domain holders after
email anonymization, over 25% do not offer such channel.
Email anonymization. Though email addresses are instructed
to be anonymized, redacting them or making them empty is
not recommended. Domain holders need to be reached via
email for various reasons, such as domain validation of TLS
certiﬁcates [31], vulnerability notiﬁcation [66], [97], [89] and
inquiries of domain reselling. As required by the ICANN
Temporary Speciﬁcation, registrars should set up interfaces
that facilitate direct communication with the domain holder
(see Table I, the requirement applies to registrars only). Among
the 73 GDPR-compliant registrars, we ﬁnd that over 70%
registrars are following the requirements: 40 leverage web
links and 12 use pseudonymized email addresses which are
unique for each domain. Another 15 registrars avoid direct
messaging – instead, they use tiered access systems (e.g.,
https://tieredaccess.com used by 6 registrars) or
uniﬁed email addresses (e.g., PI:EMAIL) as proxies to
hide registrants’ emails. Some examples are shown in Table V.
The remaining 6 registrars (e.g., ID-140 Acens Technologies,
S.L.U.) redact email addresses together with other contact
information, which is also not recommended.
To learn how the interfaces are operated, we perform ﬁeld
study on top registrars (15 using web links and 5 using
pseudonymized email addresses). We register domain names
as holders under the registrars and send messages via the web
links or pseudonymized email addresses. It turns out that the
interfaces simply forward our messages to the registrant’s real
email address. Therefore, the sender’s email address can be
found in the From or Reply-to header ﬁelds of the received
message, and the domain holder must use his/her real email
address to reply to the message. We consider the protection
offered by the interfaces insufﬁcient and suggest the registrars
1) set up a mail transfer agent (MTA) [110] for automatic
email forwarding and 2) conﬁgure the mail server to sanitize
headers for better privacy protection.
Observation 6: Though the GDPR is supposed to regulate
EEA data only, over 60% providers also sanitize non-EEA
WHOIS records, causing a global impact to WHOIS.
Scope of protection. As described in Section II, a WHOIS
provider may choose to apply data protection to EEA domains
only or beyond. To learn the preferences of WHOIS providers,
we select a subset of the 124 GDPR-compliant providers, of
which each one also has over 50 non-EEA records collected
per week for at least 90 weeks, to measure the difference
11

subjects (registrant, admin and tech) and registrant region
(EEA and non-EEA).
between EEA and non-EEA records. There are 88 providers
matching the criteria and we plot the weekly outlier ratios of
EEA and non-EEA records in Figure 8 of the top 16. Note
that we plot separate lines for registrant, admin and tech, and
ﬁnd the general trends of them are similar. Surprisingly, we
ﬁnd that 80 providers (of 124, 64.5%) choose to aggressively
sanitize non-EEA domains as well. The remaining 8 providers
are all registrars (e.g., ID-2 Network Solutions, LLC and ID-
625 Name.com, Inc.), offering protection to EEA domains
only. As a result, though EEA domains constitute a small share
(only 12% in our dataset, as shown in Table II), they do impact
the entire WHOIS system due to the GDPR.
To understand the rationale behind applying protection to
non-EEA records, we inquired a large registrar and were told
that dealing with EEA and non-EEA records together is easier
than treating them separately. Because there was only one
week for the providers to respond after the ICANN Temporary
Speciﬁcation, they ﬁnd it challenging to identify which data is
governed by the GDPR, and are thus forced to use the “safest”
