### Large-Scale Collection and Parsing of WHOIS Data

For example, [70] crawled WHOIS records for 102 million domains, and a study in 2020 [63] utilized the full WHOIS dataset from DomainTools. Regarding data analysis, the WHOIS dataset is provided to us solely for research purposes, and all programs are executed on the servers of our industrial partner. Throughout our study, the WHOIS records in the dataset were never shared with third parties. We also consulted legal experts regarding the analysis of EEA (European Economic Area) records and were informed that it does not violate GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) regulations. Since our data processing is for research purposes only and is not related to offering goods or services to EU citizens, analyzing WHOIS data is permissible under Recital 23 [3] of the GDPR.

### WHOIS Providers with a Large Number of EEA Domains

In this section, we examine WHOIS providers that maintain a significant number of EEA domains. We use GCChecker on weekly data to conduct both macro-level (e.g., overall GDPR compliance) and micro-level (e.g., specific WHOIS record masking) analyses.

#### A. WHOIS Provider Selection

We selected qualified providers based on the number of EEA records observed in our dataset per week. Specifically, we counted the number of weeks in which more than 50 EEA records (i.e., 2× min_samples) were collected for each provider and chose those with more than 90 weeks (i.e., 90% of all weeks). This method ensures that our clustering method can be applied without modification and that there are sufficient weeks for measurement. In total, 89 registrars and 54 registries met the criteria, as shown in Table IV.

According to ICANN reports, the selected registrars sponsor 63.08% of all registered domain names (see Appendix A for detailed registrar domain share). For registries, since ICANN does not report their share, we show the number of sponsored TLDs in our dataset. Leading registries like VeriSign (managing .com and .net) are not included because their managed TLDs use "thin WHOIS" and are not queried by our industrial partner. As the selected WHOIS providers offer services to EEA registrants, they fall under the scope of the GDPR and ICANN Temporary Specification.

#### B. Status of GDPR Compliance

For each WHOIS provider, we used GCChecker to analyze the WHOIS strings under the registrant contact of EEA domains, obtaining their weekly outlier ratios and compliance categories (i.e., "fully," "partially," or "not"). We excluded tech and admin contacts as their trends are similar.

**Observation 1:** The enforcement of the GDPR has had a profound impact on WHOIS data release: over 85% of the large WHOIS providers we studied are now GDPR-compliant.

**Observation 2:** Not all registries are fully GDPR-compliant as of December 2019.

Table IV presents the detailed clustering results of the top WHOIS providers. In total, 124 (86.7% of 143) providers are classified as fully compliant, including 73 registrars and 51 registries. In Sections IV-C and IV-D, we will further investigate their time of GDPR compliance and protection measures. Additionally, 9 (6.3% of 143) providers are classified as partially compliant, and the remaining 10 (7.0% of 143) providers are classified as not compliant.

Although registries are expected to be fully compliant due to their close collaboration with ICANN, we found three exceptions. Two registries (NeuStar, Inc. and Fundació PuntCAT) of two TLDs (.us and .cat) are classified as not compliant, with over 90% of their WHOIS records being outliers. The .us case is particularly interesting. According to a 2005 decision by the US National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the information of .us domain holders should not be kept private [74]. However, this decision should be revisited since .us does offer registration services to EEA residents, who are protected by the GDPR.

One registry (Afilias, Inc.) is classified as partially compliant. We found that the domain outliers are all under the .srl TLD, while other WHOIS records are protected.

**Observation 3:** While most registrars are striving to protect their domains, some flawed implementations have been discovered.

By manually inspecting outlying records, we found that some providers do not mask all contact fields required by the ICANN Temporary Specification. For instance, four registrars (ID-2487, ID-447, ID-1011, and ID-1564) do not protect the address fields (i.e., Registrant Street, City, and Postal Code). For approximately 10% of domains sponsored by ID-81 and ID-1725, only the email address field is masked. We recommend that these providers update their data protection policies.

While we identified the root causes of compliance failure for six providers, we could not determine obvious reasons for the remaining ones solely from WHOIS data. We have reported these issues to the providers. In feedback from NameCheap and NameSilo, their explanation is that registrants opt-in to display their WHOIS information (e.g., through email verification). In feedback from Gandi, the unprotected information comes from registrants who chose to opt-out of the default privacy protection service before the GDPR went into effect, and their choice is respected. To assist WHOIS providers in addressing this issue, we have implemented an online tool to check their current GDPR compliance status, leveraging some building blocks of GCChecker (described in Section VII).

#### C. Timeline of GDPR Compliance

**Observation 4:** Over 80% of large, GDPR-compliant WHOIS providers completed data protection in a timely manner before the GDPR went into effect (on May 25, 2018), but they waited to take action after the adoption of the ICANN Temporary Specification (on May 17, 2018).

Figure 7 shows the weekly outlier ratio of 124 GDPR-compliant WHOIS providers. Around the GDPR effective date (May 25, 2018), we observed a significant drop in the outlier ratio for most providers, indicating large-scale data masking. To quantify this change, we used the first week where the outlier ratio dropped below 0.05 as the starting time of compliance. As a result, 100 (80.6% of 124) WHOIS providers completed their data protection measures by this time.

#### D. Data Protection Measures

**Contact Masking:** The ICANN Temporary Specification suggests that contact information can be either redacted or filled with an empty value. In practice, this suggestion is widely adopted by WHOIS providers. For example, 46 registrars (e.g., ID-69 Tucows Domains Inc.) and 12 registries (e.g., .vip and .amsterdam registries) use redacted values; 24 registrars (e.g., ID-146 GoDaddy.com, LLC) and 39 registries (e.g., .org and .site registries) use empty values. Examples of redacted values include:
- "redacted for privacy" (e.g., ID-69 Tucows Domains Inc.)
- "statutory masking enabled" (e.g., ID-2 Network Solutions, LLC)
- "non-public data" (e.g., ID-625 Name.com, Inc.)
- "not disclosed" (e.g., ID-1505 Gransy, s.r.o.)
- "redacted" (e.g., .wien Registry)

Additionally, WHOIS privacy protection services are leveraged by registrars for contact masking. In this case, real registrant information is replaced with the name and address of the service. While typically paid, some registrars made these services free in response to the GDPR (e.g., WhoisGuard [15]). By identifying a small set of keywords (e.g., "privacy" and "protected"), we found that 13 registrars mask a portion of records, and 3 registrars (e.g., ID-1456 NetArt Registrar Sp. z o.o.) mask all records using WHOIS privacy services to comply with the GDPR.

**Email Anonymization:** Although email addresses are instructed to be anonymized, redacting them or making them empty is not recommended. Domain holders need to be reachable via email for various reasons, such as domain validation of TLS certificates [31], vulnerability notification [66, 97, 89], and inquiries about domain reselling. As required by the ICANN Temporary Specification, registrars should set up interfaces that facilitate direct communication with the domain holder (see Table I, the requirement applies to registrars only). Among the 73 GDPR-compliant registrars, over 70% are following the requirements: 40 use web links, and 12 use pseudonymized email addresses unique to each domain. Another 15 registrars avoid direct messaging and instead use tiered access systems (e.g., https://tieredaccess.com used by 6 registrars) or unified email addresses (e.g., PI:EMAIL) as proxies to hide registrants' emails. Some examples are shown in Table V. The remaining 6 registrars (e.g., ID-140 Acens Technologies, S.L.U.) redact email addresses along with other contact information, which is not recommended.

To understand how these interfaces operate, we conducted a field study on top registrars (15 using web links and 5 using pseudonymized email addresses). We registered domain names as holders under these registrars and sent messages via the web links or pseudonymized email addresses. It turned out that the interfaces simply forward messages to the registrant's real email address. Therefore, the sender's email address can be found in the From or Reply-to header fields of the received message, and the domain holder must use their real email address to reply. We consider the protection offered by these interfaces insufficient and suggest that registrars:
1. Set up a mail transfer agent (MTA) [110] for automatic email forwarding.
2. Configure the mail server to sanitize headers for better privacy protection.

**Observation 5:** Although most GDPR-compliant registrars offer direct communication channels to domain holders after email anonymization, over 25% do not provide such channels.

**Observation 6:** Although the GDPR is intended to regulate EEA data only, over 60% of providers also sanitize non-EEA WHOIS records, causing a global impact on WHOIS.

**Scope of Protection:** As described in Section II, a WHOIS provider may choose to apply data protection to EEA domains only or beyond. To learn the preferences of WHOIS providers, we selected a subset of the 124 GDPR-compliant providers, each with over 50 non-EEA records collected per week for at least 90 weeks, to measure the difference between EEA and non-EEA records. There are 88 providers meeting the criteria, and we plotted the weekly outlier ratios of EEA and non-EEA records in Figure 8 for the top 16. Note that we plotted separate lines for registrant, admin, and tech, and found that the general trends are similar. Surprisingly, we found that 80 providers (64.5% of 124) choose to aggressively sanitize non-EEA domains as well. The remaining 8 providers, all registrars (e.g., ID-2 Network Solutions, LLC and ID-625 Name.com, Inc.), offer protection to EEA domains only. As a result, although EEA domains constitute a small share (only 12% in our dataset, as shown in Table II), they significantly impact the entire WHOIS system due to the GDPR.

To understand the rationale behind applying protection to non-EEA records, we inquired with a large registrar and were told that dealing with EEA and non-EEA records together is easier than treating them separately. Given that there was only one week for providers to respond after the ICANN Temporary Specification, they found it challenging to identify which data is governed by the GDPR and thus opted for the "safest" approach.
