Angular does not support Internet Explorer 11 (IE11). To illustrate this issue, I have created a minimal reproduction in the following Plunker:

- **Plunker Link:** [Minimal Reproduction](https://plnkr.co/edit/LOJWgfDGvtKQzhxuD8Wa?p=preview)

Please test this Plunker in IE11 to observe the problem. Additionally, the same issue occurs when using Webpack for bundling.

If you need further assistance or have any questions, feel free to let me know.
