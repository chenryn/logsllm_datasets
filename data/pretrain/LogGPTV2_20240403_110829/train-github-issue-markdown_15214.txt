Hello Typescript!
In our typescript file, we have the following function implementation:
    protected foo(): {a: A; b: B;}[] {
      return null;
    }
When the compiler runs, it throws the following errors  
Return type of public method from exported class has or is using private name
'A'.  
Return type of public method from exported class has or is using private name
'B'.
Is this expected or is this a bug? My first instinct is that A/B are not
private and thus should not have this error be thrown.
Note that if protected is changed to public, the error doesn't appear.
