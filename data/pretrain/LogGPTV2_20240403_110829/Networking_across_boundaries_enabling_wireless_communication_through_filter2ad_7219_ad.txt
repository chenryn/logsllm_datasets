larger than 5 mm (i.e., the wavelength of our millimeter wave
radar). This phase wrapping arises from the waves at the
surface of the water, whose presence masks the µm-scale
vibrations from the acoustic transmitter.
To eliminate the impact of these waves, TARF first unwraps
the phase. We plot the output of the unwrapped phase over
time in Fig. 6(b). The waves exhibit a peak-to-peak variation
of 50 radians. Given a wavelength of 5 mm, this corresponds
to a 2cm peak-to-peak displacement, as per Eq. 8.
Next, to eliminate the impact of the waves, TARF filters
the unwrapped phase and plots the output in Fig. 6(c). Note
that in order to visualize the phase variations, the axis of this
figure is zoomed in both in time and amplitude. Upon filtering
the ocean waves, we can now see the single-tone transmitted
by TARF’s underwater speaker at 150 Hz. Note that TARF
can always filter out ocean waves since their frequency is
significantly lower than its range of operation. Specifically,
ocean waves typically range between 0.1Hz − 3Hz [43] while
TARF’s transmitter operates above 100 Hz.
The above description demonstrates why using millimeter-
wave frequencies offers a sweet spot for TARF communica-
tion. Specifically, they enable a TARF receiver to overcome
(unwrap and filter) the impact of ocean waves while at the
same time sensing surface displacements (of the order of few
µm) due to underwater acoustic pressure waves.
6.2.3 Decoding
Our above experiment was conducted by configuring the un-
derwater speaker to transmit a single frequency. In practice,
however, a TARF transmitter sends OFDM symbols over its
bandwidth of operation as described in §5. To decode these
symbols, TARF’s receiver performs standard OFDM packet
detection, extracts the channel and the modulations from the
header, and uses them to decode the packet payload.

Implementation
7 IMPLEMENTATION & EVALUATION
7.1
Our prototype implementation of TARF consists of an un-
derwater acoustic speaker as a transmitter and an airborne
millimeter wave FMCW radar as a receiver.
(a) Acoustic Uplink. We implemented TARF’s uplink trans-
mitter using an underwater speaker, namely the Electro-Voice
UW30 Underwater Loudspeaker [1]. The speaker was con-
nected to the output audio jack of a Lenovo Thinkstation PC
through a power amplifier. In our evaluation, we used two
types of amplifiers: the OSD 75W Compact Subwoofer Am-
plifier [2] and the Pyle 300W Stereo Receiver [3]. TARF’s
transmit power levels are comparable to standard low power
acoustic transducers used in underwater communications [46].
We configure the speaker to transmit signals over a bandwidth
of 100Hz between 100Hz and 200Hz. Such bandwidth is typ-
ical for underwater communication systems [60].
TARF’s transmitter encodes its data using OFDM modula-
tion. Each OFDM symbol consists of 64 subcarriers which
cover the available bandwidth. The transmitter performs per-
subcarrier power allocation and bit-rate adaptation as de-
scribed in §5. Each OFDM symbol is pre-pended with a
cyclic prefix, as in prior proposals that perform per-subcarrier
bitrate adaptation [38].
Unless otherwise noted, in each experimental trial, we
transmit 10 back-to-back OFDM symbols (two symbols act
as a preamble and 8 as payload). The transmitter can include
the modulation scheme for every subcarrier in its header, and
a CRC for every subcarrier to determine whether the packet
was received correctly.
(b) Millimeter-Wave FMCW Radar. We implemented
TARF’s receiver as a custom-built millimeter-wave FMCW
radar. To generate the desired millimeter-wave signals, we
first generate a reference FMCW signal using a design similar
to that implemented in [6]. The reference outputs a frequency
ramp with a center frequency of 8.65GHz and a bandwidth of
500MHz. We feed the output of this FMCW signal generator
into a 2× frequency multiplier, whose output is in turn fed as a
local oscillator to an off-the-shelf millimeter wave transmitter
and receiver. This architecture enables transmitting and receiv-
ing an FMCW signal with a center frequency of 60GHz and a
bandwidth of 3GHz. This results in an effective range reso-
lution of 5 cm, and a phase sensitivity of 1.25rad/mm. The
millimeter wave transmit and receive boards are connected to
23 dBi horn antennas [4].
We programmed our FMCW generator to sweep its band-
width every 80µs. The receiver captures and downconverts
the reflected signals to baseband and feeds them into a USRP
N210 software radio [5] equipped with an LFRX daughter-
board. The USRP digitizes the signals and sends them over

tic transmitter placed 70 cm below the surface. (b) shows the pool setup,

wave radar was placed around 30 cm above the water surface and pointed
downwards to record the acoustic vibrations.

for post-processing.
We implemented TARF’s decoder in MATLAB. The de-
coder identifies the range bin corresponding to the water
surface as described in §6, then extracts the phase of the re-
flection and performs unwrapping and filtering. To decode the
filtered phase signal, it performs packet detection, channel es-
timation, and decoding similar to a standard OFDM decoder.
7.2 Evaluation
We evaluated TARF in controlled and uncontrolled settings.
We tested it in two environments: an enclosed water tank and
a swimming pool during normal activity.
(a) Water Tank. Most of our evaluation was performed in
a water tank of 1.3m depth and 3m × 5m rectangular cross
section, as shown in Fig. 7(a). In these experiments, we varied
the height of the radar between 20cm and 40cm above the
water surface, and varied the depth of the speaker between
5cm and 70cm. We also experimented with different locations
across the tank and with different acoustic transmission levels.
To evaluate the robustness of TARF to waves, we manually
generated the waves with a floating object and measured
their peak-to-peak amplitude with a graded ruler at the water
surface directly above the speaker.
(b) Swimming Pool. To evaluate TARF in a less controlled
environment and at greater depths, we performed experiments
in a swimming pool during normal activity. Fig. 7(b) shows
our experimental setup. In our experiments, we placed the
radar 30cm above the water surface and submerged the acous-
tic transmitter at depths between 90cm and 3.6m. During our
experiments, the water surface was continuously disturbed
by swimmers and circulation vents, enabling us to evaluate
TARF’s robustness to environmental challenges.

8 RESULTS
8.1 Performance
To evaluate TARF as a communication modality, we per-
formed controlled experiments in the water tank setup de-
scribed in §7.2 and measured TARF’s throughput across the
water-air interface.
We performed 500 experimental trials in total. We varied
the location and height of TARF’s transmitter and receiver as
described in §7.2. We tested TARF in four configurations: the
first three employ uniform power distribution and modulation
across all the OFDM subcarriers using BPSK, QPSK and
16QAM. The final configuration incorporates TARF’s power
allocation and rate adaptation schemes.
(a) BER-SNR curves. The performance of a wireless receiver
can be evaluated through plots of the bit error rate to the
signal to noise ratio, called the BER-SNR curves [22, 38]. We
computed the BER as the fraction of correctly decoded bits
to total transmitted bits. We computed the signal power as the
squared channel estimate, and computed the noise power as
the squared difference between the received signal and the
transmitted signal multiplied by the channel estimate.
Fig. 8 plots the BER-SNR curves of TARF with BPSK (in
blue), QPSK (in red), and 16-QAM (in green) modulations
and compares them to the theoretical BER-SNR curves of
the respective modulation schemes (in dashed lines) [22]. We
make the following observations:
• TARF’s BER-SNR curves follow a similar trend to the the-
oretical ones. These trends demonstrate that TARF presents
a viable cross-medium communication channel.
• Similar to standard communication systems, conservative
modulation schemes (e.g., BPSK) maintain lower BER at
the same SNR. This is expected since more conservative
schemes allocate more power for every bit.
• There is a discrepancy between TARF’s performance and
a theoretically optimal decoder. This can be explained by
the fact that TARF’s decoder is not ideal and its channel
estimation is not perfect.
Figure 9—Per-subcarrier Throughput vs SNR. The figure plots the per-
subcarrier throughput against SNR for BPSK, QPSK and 16QAM. The
dashed lines show the theoretically predicted behavior for each modulation.
(b) Per-subcarrier Throughput-SNR curves. Recall that
TARF multiplexes independent flows across OFDM subcar-
riers as described in §5. We are interested in evaluating the
throughput versus per-subcarrier SNR. In our evaluation, we
compute the throughput as the average number of correctly
decoded packets (multiplied by bits per packet) at each SNR.
Fig. 9 plots the per-subcarrier throughput versus the SNR.
The figure shows empirical results for BPSK (in blue), QPSK
(in red), and 16-QAM (in green) and compares them to the
theoretical throughput-SNR curves (plotted with dashed lines).
We make the following remarks:
• Similar to our BER-SNR curves from §8.1(a), these per-
subcarrier throughput-to-SNR curves follow a similar trend
to the theoretical ones. This further confirms TARF as a
viable communication channel.
• Also similar to the BER-SNR curves, there is a discrepancy
between the empirical and theoretical curves. We observe
that this discrepancy is more pronounced at lower SNRs, an
observation that can be explained by less perfect channel
estimation at the lower SNRs.
• The figure shows that for lower SNRs, higher modulations
can achieve higher throughput. This demonstrates the need
for TARF’s rate adaptation technique.
(c) Aggregate Throughput-SNR curves. Next, we evaluate
TARF’s overall throughput performance as a function of over-
all SNR. The overall throughput is computed by summing
the per-subcarrier throughput across all the subcarriers. The
overall SNR is computed as the total signal power across
all subcarriers divided by the total noise power across the
subcarriers. For fair comparison to TARF’s power and rate
adaptation scheme, we plot the achieved throughput as a func-
tion of the SNR computed prior to TARF’s power allocation.
Fig. 10 plots TARF’s overall throughput for the flat modu-
lation schemes: BPSK (in green), QPSK (in red), 16-QAM (in
blue) as well as with the adaptive modulation scheme from §5
(in black). We make the following observations:

Figure 10—Throughput vs Average SNR. TARF’s power and rate adapta-
tion achieves higher throughput than uniform power allocation and outper-
forms flat modulations.
• TARF can achieve throughputs of 100 bps, 200 bps and
400 bps for BPSK, QPSK and 16-QAM modulation respec-
tively. This can be explained by the 100Hz bandwidth and
the corresponding modulation schemes. These throughputs
are similar to standard communication rates for underwater
acoustic communication links [46].
• TARF’s power and rate adaptation consistently outper-
forms flat modulation schemes. This is due to two reasons:
optimal power allocation and adapting the modulation for
each channel to the per-subcarrier SNR.
• TARF’s benefits are particularly significant in low SNR
regimes, which represent the prevailing scenario of under-
water communication. Specifically, at an SNR of 0 dB,
TARF’s rate and power adaptation can achieve about
10× throughput increase over any of the flat modulation
schemes. This emphasizes the need for power and rate
adaptation in a TARF communication link.
8.2 SNR Microbenchmarks
Next, we are interested in studying the SNR trends of TARF as
a function of different parameters. In particular, we would like
to quantify the impact of depth (of the underwater transmitter)
and alignment (between the transmitter and the receiver) on
the SNR of the received signal.
(a) SNR vs Depth. To understand the impact of depth on
SNR, we evaluated TARF in the swimming pool setup de-
scribed in §7. We placed the FMCW radar 30 cm above the
water surface at the edge of the pool, and varied the depth
of the underwater speaker between 90 cm and 3.6 m. We
overpowered the speaker with the Pyle 300W Stereo receiver
and configured it to transmit a single tone at 150 Hz, and we
measured the resulting surface vibration using the radar. We
performed 45 three-second trials across the different depths.
Fig. 11 shows our results. The figure plots the mean and
standard deviation of the received signal as a function of
distance (in orange). We make the following observations:
12
Figure 11—SNR vs Transmitter Depth. The figure shows that TARF’s
SNR decreases with depth (in orange) following a 1/r 2 trend (in blue). It
outperforms pure RF links which decay exponentially in distance underwater.
Error bars indicate standard deviation.
• The SNR decreases from around 25 dB at 90 cm to 14 dB
at 3.6 m. The SNR trend follows a 1/r 2 curve (plotted in
orange on the same figure) and matches the theoretically-
predicted behavior of pathloss from §4.2.
• The SNR trend with depth demonstrates the superiority of
TARF over a pure RF communication link. In particular,
RF signals in the GHz range decay exponentially at a rate
of around 1000 dB/m in seawater [24, 29].
• TARF’s recorded SNR displayed some variation from the
expected trend. This is due to noise and interference from
waves caused by swimmers and water circulation cycles.
(b) SNR vs Alignment. Our experiments so far have focused
on scenarios where the transmitter and the receiver are aligned
along the same (vertical) axis to maximize the SNR. Next,
we evaluated TARF’s performance with varying degrees of
misalignment. We performed this evaluation in the water tank
setup, where we placed the radar 20 cm above the water sur-
face and placed the speaker 40 cm below the surface. To
understand TARF’s performance as a function of different
alignments, we varied the speaker’s location at different hori-
zontal displacements in the plane parallel to the water surface.
Fig. 12 plots the computed mean and standard deviation of
the SNR as a function of the horizontal displacement between
the underwater speaker and the FMCW radar. The figure
shows that the SNR decreases from 11 dB when the transmit-
ter and receiver are vertically aligned to around 3 dB when
the horizontal misalignment is around 28 cm. Interestingly,
the degradation is less than 10dB within a disk of diameter
about half a meter. It is important to note, however, that this
SNR degradation is dependent on the beam profiles of both
