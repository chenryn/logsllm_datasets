## üêõ Bug
Load pytorch tensor created by torch.save(tensor_name, tensor_path) in c++
libtorch failed.  
How can I save some tensor in python, but load it in libtorch?
## To Reproduce
using the following code:
I save tensor named piror using python, using the code:
    prior = torch.ones(32145, 4)
    torch.save(prior,  'prior.pth')
And I load the tensor in libtorch using C++, by the following code:
    torch::Tensor priors = torch::ones({32145, 4});
    torch::load(priors , "/app/model/prior.pth");
## Expected behavior
load the tensor successfully.  
And get exact same value as in pytorch python-api.

## Additional context
But I got the error:  
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'c10::Error'  
what(): `torch::jit::load()` received a file from `torch.save()`, but
`torch::jit::load()` can only load files produced by `torch.jit.save()` (load
at ../torch/csrc/jit/serialization/import.cpp:285)
Why is that? I do not use torch::jit::load but torch::load, so how to load
tensor saved in pytorch?
Thanks in advance.
