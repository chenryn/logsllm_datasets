User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why avoid shared user accounts? I know its best practice not to allow shared user accounts, but where is this best practice defined? Is it an ISO standard or something? What is the reasons to always create per person accounts?

Assistant: Alice and Eve work for Bob. Alice is a very good worker who does exactly what Bob asks her to do. Eve is a criminal mastermind hell-bent on destroying Bob's company.

Alice and Eve both share the same account.

Eve logs into the account and uses it to sabotage an important business process. The audit log captures this action.

How does Bob know who sabotaged his company? He has to get rid of the bad actor, but can't fire both of them, because his company depends on the work that they do. He could fire just one, but he has no way of knowing which one is his friend and which one is his enemy.

If Alice and Eve had separate accounts, Bob could be sure that Eve was the one who did the sabotage. Eve might even avoid doing the sabotage, if she knows her account will be audited and she will be caught.

EDIT: Adding from comments:

If Eve quits, you now need to reset the password on every account she had access to, rather than just disabling her personal accounts. This is much harder to manage, and you will miss accounts.

Additionally, it removes your ability to have granular control over access. If Alice should be writing checks, and Eve should be signing them, you essentially have no technological way to enforce that if they share the same account.

Also, it makes it harder for a given individual to notice malicious changes to their environment. Alice knows what files are on Alice's desktop. Any new files will likely raise a red flag for her. Alice doesn't know what files are on Alice and Eve's shared desktop. It is likely new files will be met with a shrug and an assumption that another user put it there, not a malicious actor.
