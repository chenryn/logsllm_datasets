## Abstract
Latent sector errors in disk drives, which affect only a few data sectors, occur silently and are detected only when the affected area is accessed. If such an error is detected during a RAID rebuild, it can lead to data loss. Features like scrubbing and intra-disk data redundancy have been proposed to detect and recover from latent errors, thereby avoiding data loss. However, these features can cause performance degradation if not managed properly.

In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of scrubbing and intra-disk data redundancy in improving data availability while maintaining user performance within predefined bounds. By treating these features as low-priority background activities and scheduling them efficiently during idle times, we demonstrate that they can remain transparent to the storage system user while still enhancing data reliability. Detailed trace-driven simulations show that the Mean Time To Data Loss (MTTDL) improves by up to five orders of magnitude when these features are implemented independently. When both scrubbing and intra-disk parity updates are scheduled concurrently during idle times, MTTDL improves by as much as eight orders of magnitude.

## 1. Introduction
As digital storage for commercial and personal use becomes more prevalent, high data availability and reliability are increasingly critical. Traditional methods for ensuring data redundancy, such as RAID arrays, protect against disk failures but may not fully address latent sector errors. These errors, which occur silently and are detected only upon access, can cause data loss during RAID rebuilds if the system has reduced redundancy.

To mitigate this risk, features like disk scrubbing and intra-disk data redundancy have been proposed. Scrubbing detects latent sector errors via background media scans, while intra-disk data redundancy adds another level of redundancy by adding parity for sets of sectors within the same disk. However, these features can introduce performance overhead if not managed carefully.

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of these features when designed to be transparent to the user, i.e., keeping average user performance degradation within predefined targets. By treating scrubbing and intra-disk parity updates as background activities and scheduling them during idle times, we show that they can significantly improve MTTDL without degrading user performance.

## 2. Related Work
Storage systems with multiple redundancy levels, such as RAID 6, offer better protection against data loss. Additionally, features like scrubbing and intra-disk data redundancy are effective in detecting and recovering from latent sector errors. Recent studies show that scrubbing can detect up to 60% of all latent sector errors. To avoid penalizing regular user traffic, these features are typically executed as background processes during idle times.

Various approaches have been proposed to utilize idle times effectively, either locally or remotely, to enhance system performance, reliability, and consistency. Studies have also focused on managing idle times for scheduling background activities, such as powering down disks. In this paper, we use the concept of managing idle times proposed in [14], where the decision to start scheduling a background job is based on the empirical distribution of previously monitored idle times. We customize these policies for scrubbing and intra-disk parity updates, showing significant improvements in MTTDL.

## 3. Background - MTTDL Estimation
The Mean-Time-To-Data-Loss (MTTDL) is a key reliability metric for storage systems. We use the MTTDL models from [2] to estimate the impact of scrubbing and intra-disk data redundancy. The MTTDL is defined based on parameters such as the mean interarrival time of visible and latent disk errors, mean recovery time, and spatial and temporal locality of errors. Equations (1) and (2) provide the MTTDL with and without scrubbing, respectively.

## 4. Scheduling Background Activities
Using disk idle times to complete background activities with minimal obstruction to foreground jobs is a common approach. Idle waiting, which delays the scheduling of background jobs during idle intervals, is an effective mechanism to reduce foreground performance degradation. An algorithmic approach to estimate how long to idle wait based on the variability of observed idle periods is proposed in [14]. This approach increases the efficiency of idle waiting as the variability of the empirical distribution of idle times increases.

We use three background scheduling policies based on the empirical distribution function of idle times:
- **Body-based**: Schedules a few background jobs in most idle intervals, using the body of the idle times distribution.
- **Tail-based**: Schedules many background jobs in a few idle intervals, using the tail of the idle times distribution.
- **Tail+bursty**: Predicts upcoming idle intervals more accurately by batching long idle intervals together, allowing for more effective scheduling of background activities.

These policies are particularly useful for scrubbing and intra-disk parity updates, as they help increase MTTDL.

## 5. Trace Characteristics and Simulation
We evaluate the policies using trace-driven simulations. The selected disk traces, measured from a personal video recording device (PVR), a software development server, and an email server, are referred to as T1, T2, and T3, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of these traces, including request mean interarrival time, request mean service time, utilization, and the mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of idle intervals. The stochastic characteristics of the idle intervals differ among the traces, with T2 and T3 having higher variability and longer tails compared to T1.

Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of idle times for the traces, highlighting the differences in their distributions.

## 6. Analysis of Scrubbing Utilizing Idle Times
Scrubbing, which detects latent sector errors via background media scans, can be effectively scheduled during idle times to minimize its impact on foreground performance. We analyze the effectiveness of different scheduling policies for scrubbing and show that the tail-based and tail+bursty policies are particularly effective in improving MTTDL.

## 7. Analysis of Intra-Disk Parity Updates
Intra-disk parity updates, which add another level of redundancy within the same disk, can also be scheduled as background activities during idle times. We analyze the performance and data reliability consequences of enabling intra-disk parity updates and show that they can significantly improve MTTDL when combined with scrubbing.

## 8. Combined Evaluation of Scrubbing and Intra-Disk Parity Updates
We evaluate the performance and data reliability consequences of simultaneously enabling scrubbing and intra-disk parity updates as background jobs. Our results show that the combination of both features leads to significant MTTDL improvements, with the best results achieved when both features are scheduled concurrently during idle times.

## 9. Conclusions
By treating scrubbing and intra-disk parity updates as low-priority background activities and scheduling them efficiently during idle times, we demonstrate that these features can significantly improve data reliability without degrading user performance. Our trace-driven simulations show that the MTTDL can improve by up to eight orders of magnitude when both features are enabled and scheduled concurrently.
