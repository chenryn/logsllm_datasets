This happens only in `6.0.0-canary.x` releases. If you go back to `5.10.0` it
works fine.

## Expected Behavior
Should load scss in pages even if there are styles set in `_error.js`.
## Current Behavior
It doesn't load scss in pages if therea are styles set in `_error.js`,
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. git clone https://github.com/PaulRBerg/next.js-broken-scss
  2. cd next.js-broken-scss
  3. npm install
  4. npm run dev
## Context
If you try to load other scss in any file from pages, it doesn't load and it
defaults to the scss used in the custom `_error.js` file. If you comment that
out, you lose the styles for the error page, but it works on the normal ones.
I spent one full day on this, and I think it's an important bug. It's really
confusing, hard to track and reproduce, as you'd normally question the
configuration of babel, next-sass, next-compose-plugins & so on.
