### 1. Abstract
During network attacks, Command and Control (C2) servers, loader servers, and even hackers' "working machines" may start a web server for data transmission. Based on historical data from the ZoomEye cyberspace search engine [1], we found that 6.53% of the 9,247 Cobalt Strike [2] control servers have provided directory browsing and file download services, involving malicious samples, exploitation scripts, scan results, and other files. By high-frequency mapping of important network segments, we can identify more hackers' "working machines."

In our research, we also discovered that there is a behavior of traversing and downloading all files from hackers' "working machines," indicating the presence of many "hunters" on the Internet who search for these machines to steal attack tools and work results.

### 2. Overview
When hackers control other people's computers to steal files, they themselves become targets for other attackers. For example, a hacker might download a scanning tool that has been embedded with a malicious Trojan, which is then run on a computer controlled by a "hunter."

In this article, we will use the ZoomEye cyberspace search engine to locate the web servers opened by hackers and become the "hunters" behind them. During an attack, hackers encounter various environments and use common methods to deliver malicious samples, such as starting a web server and using `curl` or `wget` commands to download files. While testing samples and sending back data, hackers may start a temporary web server, which can be easily set up with a single command in languages like Python (`python3 -m http.server`).

This practice, while facilitating data transfer, also provides an opportunity for others to exploit it. If someone discovers the "working machine" used by the hacker, they can gain access to the hacker's attack tools, learn their attack methods, or even directly access the stolen data.

### 3. Using ZoomEye to Find Hackers' Working Machines
To find hackers' "working machines" using ZoomEye, we need to specify the most frequent keyword features in the title of the web page. Here are some sample search statements:

- **Vulnerability EXP attack tools:**
  ```
  (title:"Index of /" title:"Directory List" title:"Directory listing for /") + "exp"
  ```

- **Log4j exploit tools:**
  ```
  (title:"Index of /" title:"Directory List" title:"Directory listing for /") + "log4j"
  ```

- **CobaltStrike:**
  ```
  (title:"Index of /" title:"Directory List" title:"Directory listing for /") + "cobaltstrike"
  (title:"Index of /" title:"Directory List" title:"Directory listing for /") + "cobalt strike"
  ```

- **Metasploit:**
  ```
  (title:"Index of /" title:"Directory List" title:"Directory listing for /") + "Metasploit"
  ```

- **Vulnerability exploitation tools containing CVE numbers:**
  ```
  (title:"Index of /" title:"Directory List" title:"Directory listing for /") + "cve"
  ```

- **Payloads:**
  ```
  (title:"Index of /" title:"Directory List" title:"Directory listing for /") + "payload"
  ```

- **Trojan horse bundling tests:**
  ```
  (title:"Index of /" title:"Directory List" title:"Directory listing for /") + "calc.exe"
  ```

#### 3.1 Example: A Hacker Uploads a Scanning Tool for Malicious Scanning
On February 14, 2023, a server with IP address `124.200.*.*` added a tool named `fscan64.exe`. The following day, Knownsec Security Intelligence [3] captured 1,255 attack requests initiated by this IP address and marked it as a malicious IP address.

- **February 14, 2023:** The tool `fscan64.exe` was added to the server.
- **February 15, 2023:** Knownsec Security Intelligence captured 1,255 attack requests from this IP address.

#### 3.2 Example: Malicious Files Used by Hackers for Delivery
Hackers often store decoy files on their "working machines" for victims to click on. We randomly selected a file named `Google3.exe`, which appeared on the "working machine" on January 31, 2023. When uploaded to the Virustotal platform, it was identified as malicious on February 17, 2023.

- **January 31, 2023:** The `Google3.exe` file appeared on the server.
- **February 17, 2023:** The `Google3.exe` file was identified as malicious on Virustotal.

#### 3.3 Example: Obtaining Attack Tools Used by Hackers
On the hacker's "working machine," we can obtain various attack tools, including:
- **Cobalt Strike tool**
- **CVE-2019-7609 Kibana remote code execution vulnerability exploitation tool**
- **Payload code**
- **Apache James Server 2.3.2 remote code execution vulnerability exploitation tool**
- **Multiple CVE vulnerability exploitation tools**
- **EXP tools**

#### 3.4 Example: Obtaining the Results of the Hacker's Work
On the hacker's "working machine," we can also obtain the hacker's work results, such as:
- **Website scanning results**
- **Stolen victim Cookie data**
- **Stolen victim keyboard record data**
- **Stolen victim's computer files**

### 4. Mapping Important Network Segments
#### 4.1 Web Directory Browsing on Cobalt Strike Controllers
According to the ZoomEye Cyberspace search engine, between January 1, 2020, and February 16, 2023, 9,247 IP addresses were flagged as Cobalt Strike controllers. Among these, 604 IP addresses (6.53%) provided directory browsing and file downloading services. The detected file names and other information indicate that most of these files are related to hacking attacks, suggesting that some hackers' "working machines" are vulnerable to exploitation.

#### 4.2 High-Frequency Mapping of Important Network Segments
We selected 30 B-segment IP addresses with the highest number of Cobalt Strike controllers and conducted high-frequency mapping for 72 hours on ports 8000, 8080, and 8888. We checked whether these IP addresses provided directory browsing and file downloading services and whether they were hackers' "working machines."

- **Results:** Out of 1.96 million IP addresses, 176 provided directory browsing and file downloading services, with 13 being hackers' "working machines."
- **HTTP Service Analysis:** Of the 176 IP addresses, 70 closed their HTTP service after a temporary opening. This suggests that high-frequency mapping of important network segments can identify more hackers' "working machines" than querying through a cyberspace search engine.

### 5. Searching for "Hunters" on the Internet
As "hunters" behind hackers, we can directly obtain attack tools and work results from the hacker's "working machine." We speculated that such hunters already exist on the Internet and attempted to find them.

From the HTTP service on port 8000 at IP address `83.136.*.*`, we identified it as a hacker's "working machine." The file `nohup.out` is the request log file for the HTTP service.

- **Suspicious Behavior:** On January 30, 2023, IP address `34.140.*.*` traversed and downloaded files from all folders on the hacker's "working machine."
- **Threat Level:** The IP address `34.140.*.*` was labeled as a malicious IP address, tagged as "Malicious Scan," and launched 23 malicious scan attacks on January 30, 2023.
- **Hunter IP Inference:** The IP address `34.140.*.*` is not a search engine spider IP, leading us to infer that it is a "hunter IP." Three other IP addresses with similar behavior were also identified, suggesting the presence of multiple "hunters" on the Internet.

### 6. Conclusion
A hacker may act alone, but their limited technical ability and practical experience can make them vulnerable. Alternatively, they may work in teams with clear divisions of labor, but each member may only focus on their specific tasks, leaving undefined work or risks unattended. These factors allow us to capture hackers' "working machines" using the ZoomEye cyberspace search engine.

A hacker skilled in attacking may not be equally skilled in defending and can become prey to a more powerful hunter. The role of being the hacker behind the attack or the hunter behind the hacker represents an escalation in the confrontation between attack and defense, and it is the charm of mapping cyberspace from a god-like perspective.
