### 4.6 Advice and Suggestions on Exams

We will now take a few moments to discuss exams and assessments, as the experience and approach for taking exams differ significantly from other aspects of the learning process.

#### 4.6.1 The Difference Between Assessments and Exams
Some OffSec Learning Tracks conclude with an optional assessment, which is typically a timed series of practical exercises. Students have considerable flexibility in scheduling and retaking these assessments and can submit their answers at their convenience.

In other cases, OffSec courses culminate in a proctored exam, where students have a set amount of time to complete specific hands-on challenges. Successfully passing this exam results in an OffSec Certification.

The following section focuses specifically on exams, as they are often points of anxiety for learners. However, many of the suggestions provided will also be beneficial for those taking assessments.

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Develop strategies for dealing with exam-related stress.
2. Recognize when you might be ready to take the exam.
3. Understand a practical approach to the exam.

While each student will learn at their own pace, this Learning Unit should take about ten minutes to complete.

#### 4.6.2 Dealing with Stress
OffSec certifications are earned, not given. This language is intentional because having a certification from OffSec is a significant accomplishment. You cannot fake your way to the finish line or guess your way to a passing score.

For some individuals, the exam and the weeks and months leading up to it can become very stressful. We want to address this experience now.

A great deal has been written on managing stress, but we will focus on high-stakes exam stress. The Bar Exam in the United States, for example, is well-known and notoriously stress-inducing. The California bar exam, for instance, includes five hours of essay questions, a Performance Test lasting an additional hour and a half, and around 200 multiple-choice questions. There are also additional certifications required just to qualify to take the exam.

Given the extensive resources available for managing Bar Exam stress, let's review a few common themes:

1. **Take Care of Yourself:**
   - Ensure you are well-fed, well-rested, and in good health. Lack of sleep and poor diet can put you at a disadvantage before you even start.
   - Positivity and optimism are crucial. Having things to look forward to, such as a study break or time with friends, can help fuel you when you feel discouraged.

2. **Schedule and Plan Your Study:**
   - Creating a plan is critical. We will describe this in more detail shortly.

3. **Have a Growth Mindset:**
   - A growth mindset involves believing in your potential. If you believe you can conquer a challenge, you will have a head start. Conversely, if you assume you will fail, it is unlikely that you will accidentally succeed.
   - The "Not Yet Mindset" can be particularly powerful. For example, instead of saying, "I can't do the exercise," say, "I can't do the exercise yet." This small change in language opens the door to future success.

#### 4.6.3 Knowing When You’re Ready
One of the most common questions regarding exams is, "How will I know when I’m ready?" This question can take various forms, such as, "Do I need to do all of the exercises to prepare for the exam?" or "Can I prepare by completing a certain set or number of machines on VulnHub?"

It is challenging to answer this question because each student is different. Some may have decades of professional experience and only need a quick refresher, while others may need to study more intensively.

The chart below, focusing on the OSCP certification, shows a direct correlation between preparedness (working on more PEN-200 lab machines) and exam success.

As expected, the more time spent preparing, the more likely a student is to be successful. Preparation is key.

#### 4.6.4 Practical Advice for Exam Takers
We advise two main tactics for exam takers:

1. **Prepare for the Exam:**
   - Read the course materials, watch videos, and complete exercises. Effective learning strategies will give you an advantage.

2. **Understand the Exam:**
   - The OffSec help site provides detailed descriptions of each exam, including what to expect and useful tips for approaching tasks. These descriptions are available alongside other course-specific help items.
   - Additional resources include webinars, searchable blog posts, and YouTube videos of former students reviewing their exam experiences. Understanding the exam will reduce stress and improve performance.

### 4.7 Practical Steps

We have covered several abstract tactics and strategies. Now, let’s think practically and plan our approach to the coursework ahead.

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Create a long-term strategy.
2. Understand how to use a time allotment strategy.
3. Learn how and when to narrow your focus.
4. Understand the importance of a group of co-learners and finding a community.
5. Explore how best to pay attention and capitalize on your own successful learning strategies.

While each student will learn at their own pace, this Learning Unit should take about 15 minutes to complete.

#### 4.7.1 Creating a Long-Term Strategy
Choosing a particular focus, course, or learning path is a critical first step in creating a long-term strategy. Specific goals will guide your decisions on how much, when, and what topics to study.

It is possible that you may need to adjust your plan after a few weeks, and that is perfectly fine. The alternative—having no plan at all—would mean studying in an ad hoc manner, picking up and putting down materials whenever convenient.

Planning can greatly reduce stress levels. It helps create an idea of what will happen rather than allowing events to happen to you, giving you more control and reducing anxiety.

#### 4.7.2 Use Time Allotment Strategies
One of the most impactful strategies is distributing study time over multiple sessions rather than cramming. This method, called Spaced Practice, involves looking at a calendar, finding reasonable time slots, and sticking to a schedule.

Before delving deeper, we acknowledge that many students have jobs, families, and other personal commitments. While we suggest studying in the evenings, we understand that this may not be possible for everyone.

Research suggests that studying before sleep can be effective, but it is easy to push back bedtime to continue studying. Lack of sleep can negatively impact your brain’s ability to retain information. Planning study time also means planning an end to the studying.

Exercise is also beneficial for studying. Intense physical activity increases blood flow to the brain and fires neurons in the hippocampus, improving memory and recall.

#### 4.7.3 Narrowing Your Focus
Now that we know to schedule study time, let’s consider organizing our physical space. Research suggests that changing environments occasionally is beneficial.

Your study space might be at the dining room table one week and a desk in a quiet corner of a library the next. Regardless of the location, minimize distractions. Multitasking, including phone alerts and text messages, can negatively impact learning. Small habits, like putting your phone in airplane mode, can help sharpen focus.

#### 4.7.4 Pick a Strategy
Refer back to the list of strategies presented, including the SQ3R method, The Feynman Technique, and Retrieval Practice. It is okay to change strategies mid-stream and to develop a pattern that works for you. Some students may prefer to read first and then watch videos, while others may follow along with the text on a local or virtual machine.

No matter which strategy you select, it is important to have a plan in place and actively think about it. It is difficult to assess whether a strategy is successful without recognizing what that strategy actually is.

#### 4.7.5 Find a Community of Co-Learners
Let’s talk about the positive power of community. Studying as part of a community offers numerous benefits, including the opportunity to develop soft skills and the chance to explain ideas to co-learners who might be struggling.

Finally, there is something to be said for the camaraderie and enjoyment of being part of a group of co-learners, sharing the ups and downs of a course. OffSec learners can reach out to local information security groups or coworkers to create a study cohort. The OffSec Discord server also provides a way to collaborate and learn together with other students across the globe.

#### 4.7.6 Study Your Own Studies
Let’s wrap up this module by examining our responsibility not just for learning but for assessing our strategies. Since many details of a "classroom" are up to you, it is essential to reflect on and evaluate your approach to ensure continuous improvement.
