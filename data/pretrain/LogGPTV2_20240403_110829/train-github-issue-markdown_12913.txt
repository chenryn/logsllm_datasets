Hello,
I am trying to use the tooltips on all my links, including the navbar. But as
the navbar is fixed on top, I had to use the bottom position for the first
rank links.
The problem is that the tooltip-arrow was not above the tooltip but a bit
below, almost behind for the first links and way below for the links of the
dropdown list. I put the tooltip back to top for the dropdownlists but I can
get the arrow at the right position for the first links.
I found out that the .tooltip-arrow div got some css style="top:XXXpx;" (XXX
depending of the link ranking)  
Just now, I managed to force the css back to "top:0px" using the
'shown.bs.tooltip' event (nothing happened with the 'show.bs.tooltip' event)
so that the arrow shows at the wrong position a few moments before going back
in place... you can see the result here : www.theblacksmithshouse.be
Two questions :
  * why does nothing happen with the 'show.bs.tooltip' ?
  * who's messing with that 'top' position ??
Thanks for your help
