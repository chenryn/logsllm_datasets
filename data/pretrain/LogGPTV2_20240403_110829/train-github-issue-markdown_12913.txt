Subject: Issue with Tooltip Arrow Positioning on Fixed Navbar

Hello,

I am currently working on implementing tooltips for all the links on my website, including those in the fixed navbar. Since the navbar is positioned at the top of the page, I had to set the tooltip position to "bottom" for the primary links. However, this has led to an issue where the tooltip arrow is not aligned correctly; it appears slightly below or even behind the tooltip for the primary links and significantly lower for the links in the dropdown menu.

To address this, I reverted the tooltip position to "top" for the dropdown links, but I'm still struggling to properly align the arrow for the primary links. Upon investigation, I discovered that the `.tooltip-arrow` div is being assigned a `style="top:XXXpx;"` (where XXX varies depending on the link's position). 

I was able to force the CSS back to `top:0px` using the `shown.bs.tooltip` event, but this only corrects the positioning after a brief moment when the arrow is initially displayed incorrectly. The `show.bs.tooltip` event did not have any effect.

You can see the current behavior on my website: [www.theblacksmithshouse.be](http://www.theblacksmithshouse.be)

I have two specific questions:
1. Why does the `show.bs.tooltip` event not work in this case?
2. What could be causing the `top` position to be altered in the first place?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
OC
