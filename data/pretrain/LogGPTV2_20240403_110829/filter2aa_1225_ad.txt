# Team Size and Management in CTF Competitions

## Team Size Considerations
There are advantages and disadvantages to both large and small teams. Your team size will likely be determined by your friends, co-workers, and affiliations. However, if you aim for a smaller team and have many potential candidates, consider limiting the team size.

### Large Teams
- **Advantages**: More resources and expertise.
- **Disadvantages**: Potential for miscommunication and inefficiency.
- **Management Tips**:
  - Clearly define roles and responsibilities.
  - Ensure proper communication between different functional groups.
  - Example: The team "sk3wl of r00t" won last year, but their success was due to effective management, not just the number of members.

### Small Teams
- **Advantages**: Easier coordination and communication.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited resources and expertise.
- **Management Tips**:
  - Consider merging with another team to form a larger, more competitive group.
  - Carefully delineate tasks and responsibilities.

## CTF Etiquette
Many teams take the competition very seriously. Unless you personally know someone on a team, avoid watching their screens or sitting near them. Spying on other teams is a common strategy, so physical security is crucial.

## Technical Challenges
### Lightning Round
Implement the following in one x86 instruction:
```c
for (ecx = 0; ecx < 32; ecx++) {
    if ((1 << ecx) & eax) {
        ebx = ecx;
    }
}
```
- **Solution**: `BSR ebx, eax`
- **Alternative**: `BSR $eax, $ebx`
- **Assembly**: `\0x0f\xbd\xd8`

### Dirty Tricks
CTF is about hacking, and dirty tricks are part of the game. Here are some examples:

#### Security Weaknesses
- **Weakest Link**: Passwords.
- **Story**: Using the score server to reset the overwrite token on Sk3wlofr00t during DC15.

#### Web Application Attacks
- **CSRF Attack**: One team embedded an attack into their web services targeting the score server.

#### Badge Hacking
- **Example**: Badges programmed to transmit IR codes for hibernating HP laptops and activating Front Row on OS X laptops.
- **Tip**: Disable all external interfaces before bringing a machine to Defcon, especially in the CTF room.

#### Score System Hacking
- **Example**: In 2006, a team almost hacked the score system using a default admin interface in a VOIP adapter.
- **Outcome**: The device's IP was changed, causing a temporary outage.
- **Credit**: Awarded breakthrough points for their cleverness.

#### Vim Swap File Exploit
- **Example**: Two challenges solved using vim swap files in this year’s qualifiers.
- **Details**:
  - **Forensics200**: Intentional use.
  - **Pwn200**: Accidental exposure of source code during live service editing.

### Ethical Considerations
- **Avoid**:
  - Collusion
  - Denial of Service attacks
  - Physical attacks
- **Best Practice**: Always check with conference organizers if unsure.

## Learning and Preparation
### Skills
- **Classification of Knowledge**:
  - Start with a small list of essential skills.
  - Focus on the skills mentioned under roles.
  - Use online challenge sites for practice.

### Tools and Techniques
- **Framework**: Manage flags and exploit servers.
- **Scripting Languages**: Perl, Python, Ruby.
- **Reversing Tools**: IDA Pro, GDB, Immunity Debugger.
- **Practice**: Regularly use and become comfortable with these tools.
