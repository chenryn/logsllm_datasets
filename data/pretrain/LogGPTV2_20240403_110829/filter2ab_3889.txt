### Title: Kr00k: A Critical Vulnerability Affecting Over a Billion Wi-Fi Devices

**Abstract:**

We have identified a previously unknown vulnerability, dubbed Kr00k (CVE-2019-15126), which affects a significant number of Wi-Fi capable devices. Specifically, we found that Wi-Fi chips manufactured by Broadcom and Cypress, and potentially other manufacturers, could be forced to encrypt certain packets in a WPA2-protected network using an all-zero encryption key. In a successful attack, this allows an adversary to decrypt some wireless network packets.

The scale of the issue is substantial, with over a billion devices potentially affected. These include products from major manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon, and many others.

**Presentation Overview:**

1. **Technical Details and Demonstration:**
   - We will provide a detailed explanation of how the Kr00k vulnerability can be exploited.
   - A live demonstration will show how we trigger Wi-Fi reassociations on the targeted device, force the setting of the all-zero encryption key, and decrypt intercepted packets.

2. **Potential Impact and Exploitation Limitations:**
   - We will discuss the potential impact of the Kr00k vulnerability on affected devices.
   - The limitations and challenges in exploiting this vulnerability will also be addressed.

3. **Relation to Previous Research:**
   - We will explain how Kr00k relates to our earlier discovery of Key Reinstallation Attacks (KRACK) on Amazon Echo and Kindle devices, which were initially discovered by Mathy Vanhoef in 2017.
   - The similarities and differences between Kr00k and KRACK will be highlighted.

4. **New Discoveries:**
   - Exclusively for Black Hat USA, we will present our most recent findings on Wi-Fi encryption vulnerabilities affecting other chip manufacturers, including Qualcomm.

5. **Proof-of-Concept Testing Script:**
   - We will release a proof-of-concept testing script designed to trigger and detect the Kr00k vulnerability on unpatched devices.

This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Kr00k vulnerability, its implications, and the steps being taken to mitigate the risk.
