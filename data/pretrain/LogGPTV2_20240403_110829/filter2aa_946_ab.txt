possibility, the public interest would seem to favor preservation of the status quo pending
resolution of the appeal.  The Court concludes that this factor slightly favors Blizzard, but
is not sufficient to overcome the serious questions and balance of hardships that favor entry
of a stay.  The Court therefore concludes that the permanent injunction based on the
copyright and DMCA violations should be stayed pending appeal.
B.
Tortious Interference.
The law clearly provides that MDY and Donnelly may be enjoined from engaging in
tortious interference.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766, cmt. u; Graham v. Mary Kay
Inc., 25 W.W.3d 749, 755 (Tex. Ct. App. 2000) (“Injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy
when a claim of tortious interference is involved.”); Adler, Barish, Daniels, Levin & Creskoff
v. Epstein, 393 A.2d 1175, 436 n.21 (Pa. 1978) (“‘It is well settled that equity will act to
prevent unjustified interference with contractual relations.’”) (citation omitted); Walt

Peabody Advertising Serv. v. Pecora, 393 F. Supp. 328, 333 (W.D. Ky. 1975) (“[I]t has been
held that the loss of a contractual customer to a third party who induces the breach of the
contractual relationship constitutes injury for which injunctive relief shall issue.”); Special
Purpose Accounts Receivable Cooperative Corp. v. Prime One Capital Co., 125 F. Supp. 2d
1093, 1106 (S.D. Fla. 2000) (injunctive relief appropriate if the plaintiffs established tortious
interference otherwise “the plaintiff would be compelled to bring a claim against the
defendants each time they interfere with [plaintiffs’] protected rights in the future”); see also
Transgo, Inc. v. Ajac Transmission Parts Corp., 768 F.2d 1001, 1022 (9th Cir. 1985) (“‘An
injunction may be framed to bar future violations that are likely to occur.’”) (citation and
brackets omitted).  
MDY and Donnelly do not dispute that injunctive relief may be entered on the tortious
interference claim, nor do they identify serious questions that will be raised by their tortious
interference appeal.  They argue instead that serious questions exist with respect to the
copyright and DMCA claims and that “[w]ithout a copyright and DMCA violation, Blizzard
could not meet the elements for tortious interference with contract.”  Dkt. #111 at 5 n.14.
The Court does not agree.  
To establish tortious interference, Blizzard was required to show that a valid contract
exists between Blizzard and its customers, that MDY and Donnelly know of the contract, that
MDY and Donnelly intentionally and improperly interfere with the contract thereby causing
a breach, and that Blizzard is damaged as a result.  See Dkt. #82 at 22 (citations omitted).
MDY and Donnelly conceded most of these elements – that there is a valid contract between
Blizzard and its customers, that they know of the contract, and that the use of Glider breaches
the contract.  Nor did MDY and Donnelly genuinely dispute that they intentionally interfere
with the contract by promoting the use of Glider and that Blizzard is damaged as a result.
Id. at 22-23.  The key question, then, is whether MDY’s and Donnelly’s actions are improper
as a matter of law.  In concluding that they are, the Court did not rely on the fact that Glider
includes copying of Blizzard’s software to RAM (copyright infringement) and circumvents
Warden (DMCA violations).  Rather, the Court found MDY and Donnelly’s conduct to be

improper because (1) they profit from the sale of Glider knowing that its use constitutes a
direct breach of Blizzard’s legitimate and substantial contract rights, (2) their interference
causes Blizzard to lose customers and revenue, and (3) the use of Glider by WoW users
upsets the carefully balanced competitive environment of WoW.  Id. at 23-26; see Dkt. #108
at 15-16.  Thus, even if MDY and Donnelly have raised serious questions regarding their
copyright and DMCA liability, they have not identified such questions on their tortious
interference liability.  Nor have they made any effort to show that they are likely to succeed
on the merits of their appeal of the tortious interference claim.  
Because MDY and Donnelly have not shown a probability of success on the merits
or that their appeal will raise serious questions concerning the tortious interference claim,
they cannot meet the requirements for a stay pending appeal.  See Golden Gate Rest. Ass’n,
512 F.3d at 1115-16.  The Court need not address the hardship or public interest aspects of
the stay analysis.  See In re Marrama, 345 B.R. 458, 473 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2006); see also
First Brands Corp. v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 809 F.2d 1378, 1385 (9th Cir. 1987).
C.
Stay Summary and Injunction Bond.
The Court concludes that MDY and Donnelly have established their right to a stay of
the permanent injunction regarding the copyright and DMCA claims, but not the permanent
injunction on the tortious interference claim.  The Court recognizes that the separate
treatment of these issues likely will have little practical effect.  The permanent injunction on
the tortious interference claim will foreclose MDY and Donnelly’s continued marketing,
distribution, and support of Glider for use in WoW.  For this reason, the Court concludes that
Blizzard is not likely to be harmed by the stay of the copyright and DMCA injunction, and
no bond is necessary.
III.
Bond for Stay of Damages.
The parties stipulated to a $6,500,000 judgment against MDY and Donnelly on the
tortious interference and copyright infringement claims.  Dkt. ##112, 114.  Pursuant to
Rule 62(d), MDY and Donnelly may obtain a stay of that judgment pending appeal by
posting a supersedeas bond.

A full bond generally is required under Rule 62(d) because the purpose of the bond
“is to secure the appellees from a loss resulting from the stay of execution.”  Rachel v.
Banana Republic, Inc., 831 F.2d 1503, 1505 n.1 (9th Cir. 1987); see Nat’l Labor Relations
Bd. v. Westphal, 859 F.2d 818, 819 (9th Cir. 1988).  “‘In unusual circumstances, however,
the district court in its discretion may order partially secured or unsecured stays if they do
not unduly endanger the judgment creditor’s interest in ultimate recovery.’”  Athridge v.
Iglesias, 464 F. Supp. 2d 19, 23 (D.D.C. 2006) (quoting Fed. Prescription Serv., Inc. v. Am.
Pharm. Ass’n, 636 F.2d 755, 760 (D.C. Cir. 1980)); see Townsend v. Holman Consulting
Corp., 929 F.2d 1358, 1367 (9th Cir. 1991) (“[W]e have held that the district court may
permit security other than a bond.”) (citing Int’l Telemeter v. Hamlin Int’l Co., 754 F.2d
1492, 1495 (9th Cir. 1985)).  Where the “‘judgment debtor’s present financial condition is
such that the posting of a full bond would impose an undue financial burden, the court is free
to exercise its discretion to fashion some other arrangement for substitute security through
an appropriate restraint on the judgment debtor’s financial dealings, which would equal
protection to the judgment creditor.’”  In re Wymer, 5 B.R. 802, 806 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1980)
(citation and alteration omitted).
MDY and Donnelly cannot post anything close to a full bond amount of $6,500,000
and therefore request an alternative form of security for the stay of the monetary judgment
pending appeal.  MDY and Donnelly propose that they be required to put all but the
necessary funds to operate MDY for fixed overhead and salaries in an escrow account
monthly and report both monthly income and expenses to Blizzard during the pendency of
the appeal.  Dkt. #111 at 8.  Donnelly also testified at trial that while he has not set aside a
separate reserve to satisfy the monetary judgment, he has not spent any profits from the sale
of Glider since this litigation began.
The Court concludes that an alternative form of security is appropriate.  The appeal
will raise serious questions concerning the copyright and DMCA claims and MDY and
Donnelly have shown that their “‘financial condition is so impaired that [they] would have
difficulty in securing a supersedeas bond.’”  In re Wymer, 5 B.R. at 806 (citation omitted).

The Court will require MDY and Donnelly to place all profits obtained from the sale of
Glider or other operations of MDY, including all monies set aside by MDY and Donnelly
since the commencement of this suit, in an escrow account approved by Blizzard.  Such
funds shall remain in escrow pending further order of the Court.  MDY shall report its
monthly income and expenses to Blizzard during the pendency of the appeal.  Within 30 days
after all appeals being exhausted, the parties shall file a joint status report regarding the
appropriate disposition of the escrow funds.
IT IS ORDERED:
1.
Copyright and DMCA Permanent Injunction.  Having found MDY Industries,
LLC (“MDY”) and Michael Donnelly liable to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Vivendi
Games, Inc. (“Blizzard”) for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement and for
violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), the Court permanently
enjoins MDY and Michael Donnelly from engaging in contributory or vicarious copyright
infringement and from violating the DMCA with respect to Blizzard’s copyrights in and
rights to the World of Warcraft game (“WoW”).  MDY and Donnelly are enjoined from
(a) marketing, selling, supporting, distributing, or developing Glider for use in connection
with WoW; (b) infringing, or contributing to the infringement of, Blizzard’s copyrights in
WoW software; (c) circumventing, or contributing to the circumvention of, Blizzard’s
protection mechanisms that control access to the dynamic, nonliteral elements of WoW,
including but not limited to the circumvention of Warden; and (d) operating or supporting
any server that authenticates copies of Glider for use in WoW or provides Glider with
information about the memory addresses WoW uses to store its game state information.  This
permanent injunction shall apply with the same force and effect to any future release of the
World of Warcraft Game Client in which Blizzard has a financial or other interest, which
interest is known to MDY or Donnelly.  The permanent injunction set forth in this
paragraph shall be stayed pending appeal.
2.
Tortious Interference Permanent Injunction.  Having found MDY and Michael
Donnelly liable to Blizzard for tortious interference with contract, the Court permanently

enjoins MDY and Michael Donnelly from tortiously interfering with the End Use License
Agreement (“EULA”) and Terms of Use Agreement (“TOU”) that Blizzard enters into with
its WoW customers.  MDY and Donnelly are enjoined from (a) marketing, selling,
supporting, distributing, or developing Glider for use in connection with WoW; or
(b) operating or supporting any server that authenticates copies of Glider for use in WoW or
provides Glider with information about the memory addresses WoW uses to store its game
state information.  This permanent injunction shall apply with the same force and effect to
any future release of the WoW Game Client in which Blizzard has a financial or other
interest, which interest is known to MDY or  Donnelly.  This injunction shall remain in effect
so long as Blizzard’s EULA and TOU clearly prohibit the use of Glider in WoW.
3.
Bond Requirements for Stay of the Money Judgment.  MDY and Michael
Donnelly shall place all present and future profits obtained from the sale of Glider or other
operations of MDY, including all monies set aside by MDY and Donnelly from the
commencement of this suit, in an escrow account approved by Blizzard.  Such funds shall
remain in escrow pending further order of the Court.  MDY shall report its monthly income
and expenses to Blizzard during the pendency of the appeal.  Within 30 days after all appeals
being exhausted, the parties shall file a joint status report regarding the appropriate
disposition of the escrow funds.  
4.
The Court shall retain jurisdiction to hold proceedings and to enter further
orders as may be appropriate to implement or enforce the provisions of this Order and
Permanent Injunction.
DATED this 10th day of March, 2009.
