User: Python fails to quit when using Ctrl-C in Powershell/Command Prompt, and instead gives out a "KeyboardInterrupt" string. 
Recently I've reinstalled Windows 10. Before the reinstall Ctrl-C quit python (3.5/2.7) fine, with no output. 
Does anyone know why this has started happening? Whether it's just a simple setting?
The only difference I can think of is I'm now on python 3.6. Ctrl-D works in Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, and Ctrl-C works fine in an activated anaconda python2 environment for quitting python.
Assistant: Hitting Esc button on the upper corner of the keyboard seems to work for me on Windows-7, inside Spyder with numpy running, for Python 3.+
It broke the infinite ...: on an erroneous syntax in the interactive script
