## Abstract
This paper introduces a quantitative methodology and empirical results to compare different approaches for location-independent communication. Our approach leverages real Internet topologies, routing tables from actual routers, and measured workloads of device and content mobility across network addresses. We measure the extent of network mobility exhibited by mobile devices using a custom Android app deployed on hundreds of smartphones, and we measure the network mobility of Internet content from distributed vantage points. Combining this data with our quantitative methodology, we analyze the cost-benefit trade-offs of location-independent network architectures in terms of routing update cost, path stretch, and forwarding table size. Our findings indicate that more than 20% of users change over 10 IP addresses daily, suggesting that mobility is the norm rather than the exception. For purely name-based routing, each event involving the mobility of a device or popular content may result in updates at up to 14% of Internet routers; however, the fraction of impacted routers is much smaller for less popular content. These results suggest that recent proposals for pure name-based networking may be suitable for highly aggregateable content that moves infrequently but may need to be augmented with addressing-assisted approaches to handle device mobility.

## 1. Introduction
Providing an abstraction of location-independent communication—enabling communication using fixed names without concern for changing network locations—has been a long-standing goal in networking research. Proposals designed to provide seamless host mobility [36] target an abstraction of the form `connect(host_id)`, while information-centric networking proposals [28, 13, 22, 16, 19] aim for an abstraction of the form `get(content_name)`.

### Why the Current TCP/IP Internet Falls Short
A common criticism of the current TCP/IP Internet is the so-called location-identity conflation problem [42]. The Internet uses an IP address to identify both an interface and its network location. Consequently, connections break when an endpoint changes network addresses, requiring application-layer workarounds to provide a semblance of seamless mobility. Advocates of information-centric networking argue that the Internet, having inherited a century-old, tethered, device-to-device communication abstraction from the wired telephony world, is poorly suited for an Internet dominated by content traffic and a communication abstraction requiring endpoints to first obtain the network location of a host serving the requested content instead of simply procuring a copy from any convenient location. In response, researchers have proposed various designs to refactor naming, addressing, and routing to enable location-independent communication [22, 12, 36, 11, 28, 13, 22, 16, 19].

### Motivation
Our work is motivated by the observation that, although many architectural proposals share location-independence as a key design goal, there has been little prior research quantitatively comparing the different cost-benefit trade-offs struck by these architectures. One reason for the paucity of cross-architectural comparisons may be that network architecture is considered by some as part science and in good part art [51]. Another reason is that until recently, most Internet architecture efforts rarely went beyond paper designs, making it difficult to justify investing research effort in comparing them. However, programs such as GENI [4], FIA [6], and FIRE [3] are changing this state of affairs. We believe that a quantitative comparison of different approaches for location-independent communication is timely and critical for gaining a deeper understanding of cross-cutting architectural principles.

### Contribution
Our contribution is a quantitative methodology and empirical results comparing different location-independent architectures based on a common set of metrics: routing update cost, path stretch, and forwarding table size, in a context where both devices and content may be mobile. We find that existing approaches for location independence can be categorized into one of three "puristic" classes: indirection routing (e.g., Mobile IP or GSM), name-to-address resolution (e.g., DNS and IP), and name-based routing (e.g., TRIAD [22], ROFL [12], or NDN [28]). Our methodology is empirical, comparing these three pure approaches using realistic Internet topologies, routing tables from real routers, and a measured workload of content and device mobility across addresses in today’s Internet.

To measure device mobility across network locations, we developed an Android app, NomadLog, deployed on over 372 Android devices, which has been collecting device mobility data for over 14 months. To measure content mobility, we deployed a system across distributed PlanetLab nodes to estimate the rate of change of network addresses of popular and unpopular content domain names. Combining this measured mobility workload with our evaluation methodology, we arrive at the following key findings:

1. Pure name-based routing entails a prohibitively high router update cost to handle device mobility, e.g., some routers may be impacted by up to 14% of all device mobility events.
2. Over 20% of users change network addresses over 10 times a day, suggesting that high mobility is the norm rather than the exception. The median user spends around 25% of a day at ASes at least two AS hops away from the dominant AS, implying a commensurate path stretch for indirection routing approaches.
3. Pure name-based routing imposes a much lower update cost for content mobility, e.g., with best-port forwarding, routers are impacted by at most 6% of popular content mobility events, and are hardly impacted by the mobility of the long tail of unpopular content.

A key implication of our findings is that name-based routing approaches in their puristic form may be better suited for content alone but need to be augmented with addressing-assisted approaches such as DNS, Mobile IP, or a next-generation name resolution service [49] to serve as a general-purpose replacement for the TCP/IP Internet. Our findings also highlight the important differences between device and content mobility, as well as the emerging importance of the strategy layer [28, 55] in content-oriented architectures.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We begin with a discussion of background and related work (Section 2), followed by a detailed description of our evaluation methodology (Section 3); the NomadLog app to measure network mobility of devices (Section 4); an expository analytical model for the path stretch vs. update cost trade-off (Section 5); the results of our empirical evaluation of the cost-benefit trade-offs of different approaches for location independence in the context of device (Section 6) and content (Section 7) mobility; a confession of limitations and open questions (Section 8); and conclusions (Section 9).

## 2. Background and Related Work
Despite the extensive body of work on refactoring naming, addressing, and routing to enable location-independent communication, most known approaches fundamentally take one of just three different approaches: (1) indirection routing; (2) name resolution; (3) name-based routing.

### Indirection Routing
Indirection routing translates the problem of fixed-name routing to fixed-address routing as the first step. A name resolution infrastructure may be infrequently queried to translate an endpoint’s name to a home address that rarely changes by design. A home agent in the home network, as in GSM, Mobile IP, and other architectures (e.g., [30]), or a randomly chosen rendezvous location in i3 [46] is responsible for maintaining up-to-date visited addresses of its subscribers and detouring packets to them. The main strength of indirection is simplicity—an endpoint remains completely oblivious to endpoint mobility. The downside is path stretch—in order to remain oblivious, a sender must detour all packets through the destination’s home agent [41], even if the two endpoints happen to be in the same local network. The update cost of indirection routing is minimal because an endpoint only needs to update its home agent upon each mobility event. The forwarding table size at routers remains unchanged and is equal to the number of disaggregated prefixes (e.g., ~400K at core routers in today’s Internet).

### Name Resolution Approaches
Name resolution approaches rely on an extra-network service like DNS as the first step in all network communication to resolve a destination’s name to its current address. A name resolution service is an integral part of the Internet and several network architectures such as HIP, AIP, LISP, Nimrod, MobilityFirst, and XIA. As in indirection routing, the update cost of handling a mobility event is minimal because it suffices to make a single update at a logically centralized service like DNS. Network routing is based on structured addresses, so the forwarding table size at routers depends on the "aggregateability" of endpoint IP addresses. If all endpoints move randomly, then routers would have to store on the order of 4B IP addresses instead of 400K prefixes today. The path stretch depends only upon the underlying network routing; a shortest-path routing network has no stretch by definition, while policy-driven interdomain routing, as in the Internet, can incur significant path inflation [44]. Enabling location-independence through name resolution only adds a lookup latency at connection setup time but does not add additional data path stretch compared to underlying network routing.

### Name-Based Routing
Name-based routing, unlike the above approaches, routes directly over names without using addresses at all. Examples include flat-label routing architectures such as ROFL [12] or SEATTLE [29] (for a single enterprise network) or information-centric routing architectures such as TRIAD [22] and NDN [28]. From an endpoint’s perspective, eliminating addresses is a silver bullet as the network comes with intrinsic support for location-independent communication. However, achieving this abstraction purely at the network layer without inducing significant stretch or long outage times upon mobility events is nontrivial. Quantifying this trade-off is an important focus of our work.

All three broad approaches have a number of other advantages and disadvantages (e.g., incremental deployability, manageability, security, handoff outage times, etc.). We have omitted a discussion of these in line with our goal of a nuanced analysis of the cost-benefit trade-offs with respect to quantitative metrics such as path stretch, update cost, and forwarding table size. An explicit non-goal of our work is to determine the "best" among existing location-independent architectures or to propose yet another new one.

### 2.1 Related Work
The contributions of our paper lie at the intersection of network measurement—empirically characterizing the changing connectivity of both devices and content to the Internet—and network architecture—analyzing the cost-benefit trade-offs with respect to several metrics for different approaches for location-independence. Consequently, there is related past research in several areas.

#### Network Mobility Measurement
Many studies have empirically characterized physical human mobility among access points or base stations and discussed the impact of physical user mobility patterns on network performance and design. Human mobility traces have been collected from diverse access networks such as WLANs [31, 25, 14], Bluetooth networks [14], and cellular networks [23, 39, 26]. Some [23, 39, 15] have related human mobility patterns to AP and base station resource use, finding that the extent of users’ physical mobility is low and concentrated among a small number of base stations within a provider’s network, with infrequent visits to other base stations in that network. Zarić et al. [57] characterize metro-level path inflation (rather than mobility itself) experienced by mobile users accessing Google, identifying inter-domain routing, peering, and carrier topology as possible causes. Similarly, other studies have focused on the measured performance (throughput or delay) of WiFi or cellular connections in the wild [37, 43, 18] but focus on connection performance rather than on mobility itself. Acculoc [53] and CelloScope [9] describe applications that take measurements capturing location-specific information about cellular connections, but do not focus on mobility across locations or access networks as in our work.
