ABSTRACT
This paper presents a quantitative methodology and results
comparing diﬀerent approaches for location-independent com-
munication. Our approach is empirical and is based on real
Internet topologies, routing tables from real routers, and a
measured workload of the mobility of devices and content
across network addresses today. We measure the extent of
network mobility exhibited by mobile devices with a home-
brewed Android app deployed on hundreds of smartphones,
and measure the network mobility of Internet content from
distributed vantage points. We combine this measured data
with our quantitative methodology to analyze the diﬀerent
cost-bene(cid:12)t tradeoﬀs struck by location-independent net-
work architectures with respect to routing update cost, path
stretch, and forwarding table size. We (cid:12)nd that more than
20% of users change over 10 IP addresses a day, suggest-
ing that mobility is the norm rather than the exception, so
intrinsic and eﬃcient network support for mobility is criti-
cal. We also (cid:12)nd that with purely name-based routing ap-
proaches, each event involving the mobility of a device or
popular content may result in an update at up to 14% of
Internet routers; but, the fraction of impacted routers is
much smaller for the long tail of unpopular content. These
results suggest that recent proposals for pure name-based
networking may be suitable for highly aggregateable content
that moves infrequently but may need to be augmented with
addressing-assisted approaches to handle device mobility.

INTRODUCTION
Providing an abstraction of location-independent commu-
nication|enabling communication using (cid:12)xed names with-
out concern for changing network locations|has been a long-
time goal of networking research. For example, proposals
designed to provide seamless host mobility [36] target an
abstraction of the form connect(host_id); a number of pro-
posals for information-centric networking [28, 13, 22, 16, 19]
target an abstraction of the form get(content_name).
Why is the current TCP/IP Internet seen as falling short
of this goal? A common criticism is the so-called location-
identity con(cid:13)ation problem [42]. The Internet uses an IP ad-
dress to identify an interface as well as its network location.
As a result, connections break when an endpoint changes
network addresses, requiring application-layer workarounds
to provide a semblance of seamless mobility. Advocates of
information-centric networking argue that the Internet, hav-
ing inherited a century-old, tethered, device-to-device com-
munication abstraction from the wired telephony world, is
poorly-suited for an Internet dominated by content traﬃc
and a communication abstraction requiring endpoints to (cid:12)rst
obtain the network location of a host serving the requested
content instead of simply procuring a copy from any con-
venient location. In response, researchers have proposed a
number of designs to refactor naming, addressing, and rout-
ing in order to enable location-independent communication
[22, 12, 36, 11, 28, 13, 22, 16, 19].
Our work is motivated by the observation that, although
many architectural proposals share location-independence as
a key design goal, there has been little prior research quanti-
tatively comparing the diﬀerent cost-bene(cid:12)t tradeoﬀs struck
by these architectures in achieving that goal. One reason for
the paucity of cross-architectural comparisons may be that
network architecture is considered by some as part science
and in good part art [51]. Another is that until recently,
most Internet architecture eﬀorts rarely went beyond paper
designs, so a lack of a reasonably complete design speci(cid:12)ca-
tion and protocol-level implementation made it hard to jus-
tify investing research eﬀort comparing them; however pro-
grams such as GENI[4], FIA[6], and FIRE [3] are changing
this state of aﬀairs. We believe that a quantitative compar-
ison of diﬀerent approaches for location-independent com-
munication is timely and indeed critical for gaining a deeper
understanding of cross-cutting architectural principles.
Our contribution is a quantitative methodology and em-
pirical results comparing diﬀerent location-independent ar-
chitectures based on a common set of metrics, namely, rout-
ing update cost, path stretch, and forwarding table size, in
259a context where both devices and content may be mobile.
We (cid:12)nd that a number of existing approaches for location
independence can be categorized into one of three \puristic"
classes (x2): indirection routing (e.g., Mobile IP or GSM),
name-to-address resolution (e.g., DNS and IP), and name-
based routing (e.g., TRIAD [22], ROFL [12] or NDN [28]).
Our methodology is empirical, comparing these three pure
approaches using realistic Internet topologies, routing tables
from real routers, and a measured workload of content and
device mobility across addresses in today’s Internet (x3).
To measure device mobility across network locations, we
have developed an Android app, NomadLog, deployed on
over 372 Android devices and has been collecting device
mobility data for over 14 months (x4). To measure content
mobility, we deployed a system across distributed Planetlab
nodes to estimate the rate of change of network addresses of
popular content domain names (including those delegated to
CDNs) as well as unpopular content domain names. Com-
bining this measured mobility workload with our evaluation
methodology, we arrive at the following key (cid:12)ndings.
1. Pure name-based routing entails a prohibitively high
router update cost to handle device mobility today,
e.g., some routers may be impacted by up to 14% of
all device mobility events today.
2. Over 20% of users change network addresses over 10
times a day, suggesting that high mobility is the norm
rather than the exception. The median user spends
around 25% of a day at ASes at least two AS hops away
from the dominant AS, implying a commensurate path
stretch for indirection routing approaches.
3. Pure name-based routing imposes a much lower update
cost for content mobility today, e.g., with best-port for-
warding, routers are impacted by at most 6% of pop-
ular content mobility events, and are hardly impacted
by mobility of the long tail of unpopular content.
A key implication of our (cid:12)ndings is that name-based rout-
ing approaches in their puristic form may be better suited for
content alone, but need to be augmented with addressing-
assisted approaches such as DNS, Mobile IP, or a next-
generation name resolution service [49] in order to serve as a
general-purpose replacement for the TCP/IP Internet. Our
(cid:12)ndings also show the important diﬀerences between device
and content mobility, as well as the emerging importance of
the strategy layer [28, 55] in content-oriented architectures.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We
begin with a discussion of background and related work (x2)
followed by a detailed description of our evaluation method-
ology (x3); the NomadLog app to measure network mobility
of devices (x4); an expository analytical model for the path
stretch vs. update cost trade-oﬀ (x5); the results of our
empirical evaluation of the cost-bene(cid:12)t trade-oﬀs of diﬀer-
ent approaches for location independence in the context of
device (x6) and content (x7) mobility; a confession of limi-
tations and open questions (x8); and conclusions (x9).
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Despite the enormous body of work on refactoring naming,
addressing, and routing so as to enable location-independent
communication, most known approaches fundamentally take
one of just three diﬀerent approaches: (1) indirection rout-
ing; (2) name resolution; (3) name-based routing.
The fact that there are not too many diﬀerent approaches
to enable location independence should not be surprising {
in order to enable a communication abstraction of the form
connect(B,A) where B and A are (cid:12)xed names of endpoint
principals (e.g., hosts, content, or services), each of which
could be simultaneously multi-homed at diﬀerent locations
at any point in time and the set of these locations could sud-
denly change, endpoint B must resort to one of three options
in order to send the (cid:12)rst packet to A|(1) send the packet to
one (or a small number of) network router(s) that know(s)
A’s current location; (2) acquire knowledge of A’s current lo-
cation through an extra-network service and send the packet
to that location; or (3) send the packet stamped with the
name A to any router, trusting a coordinated routing and
forwarding strategy across routers to deliver the packet to
A’s current location. These three approaches are illustrated
in Figure 1. Let us next consider how a number of proposed
network architectures embody these approaches.
Figure 1: A mobility event (a) and three purist ap-
proaches (b, c, d) to handle them.
Indirection routing translates the problem of (cid:12)xed-name
routing to (cid:12)xed-address routing as the (cid:12)rst step. A name
resolution infrastructure may be infrequently queried to trans-
late an endpoint’s name to a home address that rarely changes
by design. A home agent in the home network as in GSM,
Mobile IP and other architectures (e.g., [30]) or a randomly
chosen rendezvous location in i3 [46] is responsible for main-
taining up-to-date visited addresses of its subscribers and
detouring packets to them. The main strength of indirection
is simplicity { an endpoint remains completely oblivious to
endpoint mobility. The downside is path stretch { in order to
remain oblivious, a sender must detour all packets through
the destination’s home agent [41], even if the two endpoints
happen to be in the same local network. The update cost
of indirection routing is minimal because an endpoint only
needs to update its home agent upon each mobility event.
The forwarding table size at routers remains unchanged and
is equal to the number of disaggregated pre(cid:12)xes (e.g., (cid:25)400K
at core routers in today’s Internet).
Name resolution approaches rely on an extra-network
service like DNS as the (cid:12)rst step in all network communica-
tion in order to resolve a destination’s name to its current
address. A name resolution service is an integral part of the
Internet as well as a number of network architectures such
as HIP, AIP, LISP, Nimrod, MobilityFirst, and XIA. As in
260indirection routing, the update cost of handling a mobility
event is minimal because it suﬃces to make a single update
at a logically centralized service like DNS. Network routing
is based on structured addresses, so the forwarding table size
at routers depends on the \aggregateability" of endpoint IP
addresses, e.g., if all endpoints move randomly, then routers
would have to store on the order of 4B IP addresses in-
stead of 400K pre(cid:12)xes today. The path stretch depends only
upon the underlying network routing; a shortest-path rout-
ing network has no stretch by de(cid:12)nition while policy-driven
interdomain routing as in the Internet can incur signi(cid:12)cant
path in(cid:13)ation [44]. Enabling location-independence through
name resolution only adds a lookup latency at connection
setup time, but does not add additional data path stretch
compared to underlying network routing.
Name-based routing, unlike both approaches above,
routes directly over names without using addresses at all.
Examples include (cid:13)at-label routing architectures such as
ROFL [12] or SEATTLE [29] (for a single enterprise net-
work) or information-centric routing architectures such as
TRIAD [22] and NDN [28]. From an endpoint’s perspec-
tive, eliminating addresses is a silver bullet as the network
comes with intrinsic support for location-independent com-
munication. However, achieving this abstraction purely at
the network layer without inducing signi(cid:12)cant stretch or long
outage times upon mobility events is nontrivial. Quantifying
this trade-oﬀ is an important focus of our work.
All three broad approaches above have a number of other
advantages and disadvantages (e.g., incremental deployabil-
ity, manageability, security, handoﬀ outage times, etc.). We
have omitted a discussion of these in line with our goal of a
nuanced analysis of the cost-bene(cid:12)t tradeoﬀs with respect to
quantitative metrics such as path stretch, update cost, and
forwarding table size. An explicit non-goal of our work is to
determine the \best" among existing location-independent
architectures or to propose yet another new one.
2.1 Related work
The contributions of our paper lie at the intersection of
network measurement|empirically characterizing the chang-
ing connectivity of both devices and content to the Internet|
and network architecture{analyzing the cost-bene(cid:12)t trade-
oﬀs with respect to several metrics for diﬀerent approaches
for location-independence). Consequently, there is related
past research in several areas.
Network mobility measurement. Many studies have
empirically characterized physical human mobility among
access points or base stations and discussed the impact of
physical user mobility patterns on network performance and
design. Human mobility traces have been collected from di-
verse access networks such as WLANs [31, 25, 14], Bluetooth
networks [14], and cellular networks [23, 39, 26]. Some [23,
39, 15] have related human mobility patterns to AP and base
station resource use, and have found [23, 39] that the extent
of users’ physical mobility is low and concentrated among a
small number base stations within a provider’s network with
infrequent visits to other base stations in that network. Zari-
(cid:12)s et al. [57] characterize metro-level path in(cid:13)ation (rather
than mobility itself) experienced by mobile users accessing
Google, identi(cid:12)ng inter-domain routing, peering, and carrier
topology as possible causes. Similarly, other studies have fo-
cused on the measured performance (throughput or delay)
of WiFi or cellular connections in the wild [37, 43, 18] but
focus on connection performance rather than on mobility it-
self. Acculoc [53] and CelloScope [9] describe applications
that take measurements capturing location-speci(cid:12)c informa-
tion about cellular connections, but do not focus on mobility
across locations or access networks as in our work.
