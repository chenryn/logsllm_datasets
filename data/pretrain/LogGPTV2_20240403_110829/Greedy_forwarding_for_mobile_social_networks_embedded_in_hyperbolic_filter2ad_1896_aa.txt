Information routing is one of the main tasks in many complex networks with a communication function. 
Maps produced by embedding the networks in hyperbolic space can assist this task enabling the 
implementation of efficient navigation strategies. However, only static maps have been considered 
so far, while navigation in more realistic situations, where the network structure may vary in time, 
remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze the navigability of real networks by using greedy routing 
in hyperbolic space, where the nodes are subject to a stochastic activation-inactivation dynamics. 
We find that such dynamics enhances navigability with respect to the static case. Interestingly, there 
exists an optimal intermediate activation value, which ensures the best trade-off between the increase 
in the number of successful paths and a limited growth of their length. Contrary to expectations, 
the enhanced navigability is robust even when the most connected nodes inactivate with very high 
probability. Finally, our results indicate that some real networks are ultranavigable and remain 
highly navigable even if the network structure is extremely unsteady. These findings have important 
implications for the design and evaluation of efficient routing protocols that account for the temporal 
nature of real complex networks.
Transfer of information, mass, or energy is a key function in many natural and artificial complex systems, ranging 
from gene-regulatory networks1 and the brain2 to online and offline social networks3, the Internet4, and transpor-
tation networks5. Milgram’s experiment6 showed that some of these systems can be efficiently navigated, i.e., their 
elements are able to perform an effective information routing even though they do not possess global knowledge 
of the system. This surprising property was first explained by Kleinberg using a network model7,8, in which each 
node resides in the Euclidean plane and forwards information to the neighbor which is closer to destination. 
More recently, it has been suggested that the geometry of complex networks is not Euclidean but hyperbolic, as 
a result of the interplay between the popularity and similarity attributes of the nodes9–12. Within this framework, 
the observed topological properties of complex networks are naturally explained on the basis of a hidden metric 
space defining distances between nodes, and a connection probability dependent on such distances. Moreover, 
distances in the underlying hyperbolic geometry can guide greedy routing very efficiently in scale-free networks, 
meaning that the success probability of the process is extremely high, while the routing paths deviate only slightly 
from the topological shortest paths, following closely the geodesics in the hyperbolic plane13.
These advances in the understanding of the navigability of complex networks are framed within the traditional 
approach taking the structure of networks as static. However, this assumption has been recently challenged by the 
empirical observation of a temporal dimension in many natural and social systems14–17, demonstrating that nodes 
and edges switch on and off with several time scales. The empirical analysis of such temporal networks18 has 
unveiled new statistical properties, such as a heavy-tailed distribution of inter-event times between consecutive 
links, known as burstiness19, or the heterogeneous distribution of activity in social interactions20. Temporal effects 
have been shown to impact both the behavior of dynamical processes on networks21–25 and the connectivity of 
their corresponding static representations26,27. Time-respecting paths18, for instance, play a crucial role in slowing 
down or speeding up the spreading of information or diseases28, and certainly affect also the message routing 
throughout the network.
Although navigation is expected to be substantially different in temporal networks than in static ones, few 
empirical or theoretical works have been devoted to study the impact of the temporal dimension on the naviga-
bility of complex systems4,29,30. Some of these studies are concerned with the small world property31, while others 
aim at quantifying network vulnerability to temporary failures32, or explore temporal networks using greedy

mechanisms that guarantee an optimal routing in situations where the network’s structure changes with time, or 
where noise affects the communication paths, are not fully understood yet. Uncovering such mechanisms is thus 
a fundamental task, with a broad range of potential applications, for instance, in communication engineering34 
and system biology35.
Here, we tackle this issue by proposing a hybrid model to study the navigability of temporal networks and 
show that, surprisingly, temporal networks can be navigated more efficiently than their static counterparts. 
Furthermore, we show that some real networks are ultranavigable, meaning that they remain highly navigable 
even when the network topology is strongly dynamic. Our model considers static reconstructions of real net-
works and a simple node activation-inactivation dynamics. This allows us to control for the maximum duration 
of the routing process, as well as to discard peculiar features of specific real evolving systems, such as circadian 
rhythm36. The activation dynamics may represent temporal failures of nodes due to random unknown events, or 
noise. Our approach suggests a new greedy routing protocol in static networks, that combines standard greedy 
routing and a simulated activation dynamics, which can boost the navigability of some real networks, at the 
expense of elongated paths.
Next, we set our analysis upon five different empirical networks: ArXiv collaborations (ArXiv), US 
Commodities networks (Commodities), Metabolic networks (Metabolic), the Internet at the autonomous sys-
tem level (Internet) and the World Trade Web (WTW). Detailed descriptions of the data sets can be found in

Greedy routing on temporal networks
Information packets, or other assets, are transferred in a network from a source node to a destination one by 
following greedy routing in hyperbolic space11. We consider a two-dimensional hyperbolic plane of constant neg-
ative curvature where each node i has polar coordinates (ri, θi), see Methods. The implementation of the routing 
algorithm requires that there is only one packet per source-destination pair, that each node knows its coordinates, 
the coordinates of its neighbors in the network, and the coordinates of the destination node. Then, the node 
holding the packet will transfer it to its neighbor with the smallest hyperbolic distance to the destination node.
We take the hyperbolic embedding of the largest connected component37 of each real complex network, that

where the nodes have permanent coordinates. Next, we generate several synthetic temporal networks by applying 
a Poissonian activation-inactivation dynamics on its nodes. We consider that nodes can be in an active state, 
being able to receive and forward information, or in an inactive state, in which case they cannot receive neither 
forward information packets. At each time step t, each node i is active with probability ai. Thus, at each time step 
t, a graph Gt is defined, in which only active nodes and the links between them are present. The sequence of 
= …  constitutes a synthetic temporal network of length (duration) T. The activation probabil-
graphs

ities control the density of the temporal networks, affecting the probability of a message being sent. For instance, 
in the case of a constant activation probability set equal for all nodes, ai = a, each graph Gt has an expected aver-
age degree equal to  =k
, where k is the average degree of the original static network.

Therefore, the greedy routing acts on a temporal map M G S
) depending on the temporal network  and the 
underlying hyperbolic space S. The greedy forwarding algorithm is implemented sequentially on the temporal 
), so there is one attempt to forward the information packet for each time step t. At time t, the node 
map M G S
holding the information packet tries to forward it to its neighbor with the lowest distance to the final destination. 
If the neighbor is active at time t, then it receives the packet. Otherwise, the packet remains at the holding node. 
The model with a = 1 corresponds to greedy routing on the original static network, with all nodes active at all 
times, for a number of steps equal to T. Therefore, the network’s duration T can be interpreted as the maximum 
lifetime of information packets. In this scenario, a greedy path is successful when a packet reaches its destination 
in a time t ≤ T, and unsuccessful otherwise. In the limit of T → ∞, all packets are expected to be able to reach 
their destination because the number of different paths that can be realized by greedy routing on the temporal 
networks grows with T.
We run numerical simulations for different network’s duration T, taking a number of random source–destina-
tion pairs which is the minimum between 105 and N(N − 1)/2, where N is the number of nodes of the network. In 
numerical experiments varying the activation probability, the random subset of source–destination node pairs is 
kept the same, while it is changed when varying T.

Results
We first consider a constant activation probability set equal for all nodes, ai = a. In this case, the model is charac-
terized by two parameters, the activation probability a, which controls the activation dynamics, and the network’s 
duration T, which represents the maximum lifetime of information packets. We evaluate the performance of 
greedy routing on the temporal map by measuring two main quantities: the success ratio ps, defined as the fraction 
of packets that successfully reach their destination within a time T over the total number of source-destination 
pairs considered; and the average topological stretch s of successful greedy paths, where the stretch is defined as the 
ratio between the hop-length of a greedy path and the shortest path between the corresponding source and desti-
nation nodes. The stretch tells us how much the successful greedy paths are longer with respect to the shortest 
ones.
In the Supplementary Material, we also give results for the average geometric stretch sg, which is defined anal-
ogously to s but considering the hyperbolic lengths of greedy and shortest paths; and the average coverage κ, 
which informs of the average number of different visited nodes against the average number of nodes that com-
pound a successful path.

Effects of network dynamics on navigability.  The success ratio ps is a key parameter in determining the 
navigability of complex networks. A large success ratio, close to p
s ∼ , means that almost all nodes can be 
reached by a message sent by any other node. On the contrary, if ps is small, information can not be successfully 
transmitted from most nodes. Figure 1, top row, shows the fraction of successful paths ps as a function of the 
network duration T, for different values of the activation probability a. The success ratio varies considerably 
across different static networks (a = 1), ranging from very low success ratio for the ArXiv, to p
s ∼  for the WTW 
and the Internet, which indicates a better congruence of these systems with their underlying geometry. 
Remarkably, for sufficiently large T, the success ratio in all temporal networks (a < 1) under consideration is 
larger than the one achieved on their static counterparts (dashed line, top row Fig. 1 and Table 1 in Methods). This 
effect is particularly evident for the cases where ps in the static map is rather low, such as for the ArXiv network, 
where the success ratio increases from ps = 0.24 for a = 1 to ps = 0.90 for a
0 2∼ . . Nonetheless, when the static 
success ratio is high (e.g. Internet), ps on the temporal maps increases too.
As expected, ps is a growing function of the network duration T: the larger the maximum lifetime of the pack-
ets, the higher ps. In the limit of T → ∞, ps is expected to reach its maximum since, for any pair of nodes, all dif-
ferent paths between them will be available at some time, ensuring that a successful one will certainly arise. This 
implies that the success ratio always increases with T, although the growing rate can be extremely slow for very 
large T. Oppositely, in the routing on static networks, ps does not vary with T because no new paths are added by 
increasing the lifetime of information packets.
Our results show that, surprisingly, it is more efficient to have some (or even a great number of) nodes inactive 
than having all nodes active and contributing to the routing process. The reason for this behavior is rooted in 
the fact that, with a = 1, some packets might get stuck into topological traps. From the greedy routing definition, 
indeed, it is clear that if a packet comes back to a node twice, it will come back again, and the loop would continue 
forever with the packet never reaching its destination.
To understand this mechanism, consider a node i sending a packet to his neighbor j, because j is the closest 
(among all i’s neighbors) to destination node k. If during the next time step, node i turns out to be the closest 
node to destination k among j’s neighbors, then the packet will return to i. As long as no topological change takes 
place in the network, this process will repeat endlessly. Any cycle involving a packet coming back to a node twice 
constitutes a topological trap, See Fig. 2. In contrast, if a < 1, the topology of the network changes at each time 
step, hence the packet is able to escape any topological traps it may encounter along the route and eventually reach 
its destination. Nevertheless, the new successful path followed by the packet will deviate from the geodesic con-
necting the two nodes in the hyperbolic plane, thus the path length will necessarily be longer than the shortest.

information packet always to the neighbor closest to destination. Consequently, in (a) the packet never stops 
jumping between nodes i and j and is captured by the topological trap, while in (b) the inactivation of i enables 
the packet to follow an alternative route through l and successfully reach the destination node k.

The average topological stretch s, defined as the ratio between the hop-length of greedy paths and the corre-
sponding shortest paths in the network, is also a measure of navigation efficiency. From its definition, it holds that
