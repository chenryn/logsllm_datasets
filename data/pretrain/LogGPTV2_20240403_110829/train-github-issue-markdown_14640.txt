### System info
  * Playwright Version: [v1.29.2]

  * Browser: [Chromium]
  * Other info:
### Source code
  * [] I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Config file**
    // playwright.config.ts
    import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
    export default defineConfig({
      projects: [
        {
          name: 'chromium',
          use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], },
        },
    });
**Test file (self-contained)**
    import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';
    test('testTitle', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('url');
      await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/pageTitle/);
      await page.evaluate(() => window.scroll({ top: 0 }));
      await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(); // problem occurred
    });
**Steps**
  * Run the test
  * and then error occurred
    Error: Screenshot comparison failed:
          6 pixels (ratio 0.01 of all image pixels) are different.
**Expected**  
The test should be succeeded no matter who does it.
**Actual**
The following errors may or may not occur when the same test is performed by
different engineers.  
There are people who succeed even if the version of mac Os is different, but
the error in the attached screenshot occurs
