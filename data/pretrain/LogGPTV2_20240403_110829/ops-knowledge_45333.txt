Question: In the context of polymorphic malware, why might an attacker opt to use a weaker encryption algorithm like ECB instead of a more secure option?
"A": "Weaker encryption algorithms are less resource-intensive, allowing the malware to spread more quickly.",
"B": "The primary goal of the attacker is to obfuscate the malware to avoid detection, not to ensure confidentiality.",
"C": "Strong encryption algorithms can be easily reverse-engineered, revealing the malware's signature.",
"D": "Strong encryption algorithms make it more difficult for the malware to execute its payload."
Answer: B
