# The Completion Backwards Principle: Bringing Layer 0 Issues to Layer 3

## Presentation by Geoffrey at Defcon 0x0F

### Alarm Systems

#### Fire Alarms
- **Functionality**: Actively detects fires and alerts inhabitants and/or authorities.
  
#### Burglar Alarms
- **Functionality**: Detects intrusions into the facility premises and alerts inhabitants and/or authorities.
- **Integration**: Often coexists with fire alarm systems.

### Anatomy of a Burglar Alarm

#### Basic Topology
- **Panel**: Central control unit.
- **Sensors**:
  - **Motion Sensors**: Detect movement within the monitored area.
  - **Glass Break Sensors**: Detect the sound of breaking glass.
  - **Door Triggers**: Detect when doors are opened.
  - **Smoke/Fire Sensors**: Detect smoke or fire, often integrated with fire alarms.

#### Monitoring Methods
- **Importance**: An unmonitored alarm system is ineffective. Effective monitoring is crucial for the system's success.

### (D)Evolution of Monitoring

#### Leased Lines
- **Characteristics**: Dedicated and expensive.

#### POTS Lines
- **Characteristics**: Common in all buildings and inexpensive.

#### Cellular/RF
- **Characteristics**: Cheaper but subject to outages.

#### Internet
- **Characteristics**: Lowest cost but subject to the reliability of your ISP and potential attacks by script kiddies.

### Internet Monitoring Hardware

#### DMP ICOM/ICOM-E
- **Protocol Options**: UDP (default) or TCP.
- **Port Configuration**: Default port is 2001, but it is configurable.
- **Encryption**: Only AES (128-bit) is available.
- **Fallback**: Uses POTS dialer if no contact with the central station.

#### Honeywell AlarmNet-i (7845i)
- **Protocol**: Only uses TCP.
- **Port**: Fixed at 54109.
- **Encryption**: Choice between 256-bit AES (UL certified) and Blowfish (factory default).
- **Fallback**: Uses POTS dialer if no contact with the central station.
- **Security**: No open ports; identifies as Ademco.

### IP Reporting Characteristics

#### DMP
- **Port**: 2001 (configurable).
- **Protocol**: Defaults to UDP.
- **Reporting**: Reports to CSC-1R.

#### Honeywell AlarmNet-i
- **Port**: 54109 (not configurable).
- **Protocol**: Only uses TCP.
- **Reporting**: Reports to AlarmNet 7810iR.

### Network Traffic Examples

#### AlarmNet-i Traffic
- **Example Sequence**:
  - SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, PSH-ACK, PSH-ACK, RST-ACK, and repeated sequences.

#### ICOM-E Traffic
- **Example Sequence**:
  - SYN, SYN-ACK, PSH-ACK, ACK, PSH-ACK, FIN-ACK, ACK, FIN-ACK, and repeated sequences.

### Deployment Considerations

- **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Close monitoring is essential to detect and mitigate worms that may affect the alarm system.
- **System and Main Panel Configuration**: Dialer lines may violate U.S. government rules (e.g., DCID 6/9 Annex B).
- **Installation and Configuration**: LAN connectivity means access for users, so segregation is necessary.
- **ISP and Physical Isolation**: Best practice is to use a separate ISP line and physically isolate the network.

### Network QoS
- **Importance**: Network Quality of Service (QoS) is now critical.
- **Issues**: Chatty devices can slow down system monitoring, and routing issues can adversely affect monitoring.

### Disruption Scenarios
- **Attack Surface**: Even with no apparent attack surface, IP-based communication can be vulnerable to network flooding, RST attacks, and ARP/DNS poisoning.
- **Testing**: Evaluate the impact of these attacks on the reporting window and system functionality.

### One Solution

#### Disclaimer
- **Note**: This solution is not endorsed by the U.S. Government.

#### Basis
- **Common Sense**: Based on practical experience and purloined install guides.

#### Implementation
- **Separate DSL Line**: Different ISP from the primary one, basic internet service, and account in an individual's name.
- **Bespoke Embedded Firewall**: Soekris net4801, moving to rack-mountable Soekris net5501s, Linux system built from sources.

### Why Not COTS Firewall?
- **Cost and Control**: Potentially less expensive and more control over configuration.
- **Standardization**: Standardize platform and hardware across sites.
- **Customization**: Logger is syslog-ng, includes Logwatch and Logrotate, and Ssmtp for log movement.

### Firewall Issues
- **Log Monitoring**: Use logger over stunnel to a central log server, Logwatch and Cron use Ssmtp to email reports.
- **Patching**: Controlled by staff, patches only update specific code, no unwanted dependencies.
- **Protection**: Customize ruleset as needed, consider inline Snort functionality.

### Future Work
- **Community Collaboration**: Develop traffic signatures to identify devices and test for man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack possibilities.
- **Encryption Testing**: Evaluate the effectiveness of encryption usage.
- **IPSec Usage**: In preliminary stages, discuss the possibility of using IPSec.
- **Code Release**: Releasing the firewall codebase, all suggestions for improvement are welcome.
