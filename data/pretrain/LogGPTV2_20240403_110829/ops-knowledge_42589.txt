User: some months ago, I installed Python 2.7 on my laptop (my os is Windows 7). 
After, I decided to use Python xy 2.7.3 instead of 'pure' Python; so, as suggested, I removed Python 2.7 and tried to install Python xy 2.7.3. However, when I tried to run the .exe file for installation, a warning window appears telling me that Python 2.7 is already installed on my computer. I tried to install a different version of Python xy (2.6) and everything went fine; however, I'd really prefer to use the latest version of Python xy. 
Actually, I can't figure out what went wrong whie uninstalling Python 2.7; does someone have any clue?
I can tell you that I followed the 'normal' procedure for programm uninstalltion; control panel -> Programs -> Remove Program
Thanks in advance

Assistant: Locate that set up file which was used to install Python. Run it and choose repair. If that doesn't solve the problem. Go to c:\Python(x,y) and delete this folder completely by shift+Del.
Run that set up file again and click on "Change" which will ultimately install the Python again. By default in my case option to add path and making that version of Python the default on my system was unchecked which can be figured out by seeing the red cross mark in one of the installation screen. Click on it if you want set up to make it default Python version and also click on the option to indicate you want the path to be added in windows environment variable.
No need to touch registry as previous ones will be overwritten again. 
In my case it worked. I was getting error like: 
Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: unable to load the file system codec
LookupError: no codec search functions registered: can't find encoding
Besides that un-installation was failing from control panel. So above steps solved all of my problem. Hope it helps.
