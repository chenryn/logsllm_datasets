My apologies for the off topic issue, but since I can't post to golang-nuts I
was not sure where else to raise this.
I appear to have been banned from the golang-nuts group, but am not sure why.
Is it possible to clarify why, or possibly reinstate my membership? It would
have been through my google account `PI:EMAIL`, with an additional
email address `PI:EMAIL`
Thanks.
