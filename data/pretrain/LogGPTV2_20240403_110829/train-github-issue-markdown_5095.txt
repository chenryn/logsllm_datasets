### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**
    * v12.0.0-beta.21
  * **Operating System:**
    * Ubuntu 20.04
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:**
    * v11.2.3 (the same provided example works most recent v11 release, tested!)
### Expected Behavior
Expecting `browserWindow.capturePage()` to return a promise that resolves to
captured image
### Actual Behavior
The function call will at some point result an uncaught promise exception.
Currently it seems it's random and about a 5% chance of this happening.
### To Reproduce
Minimal example is a loop calling `browserWindow.capturePage()` every 1 second
until eventually it fails. On my machine it will fail within a minute and
result in the error.  
I tried with the new `@electron/remote` and also with the old
`electron.remote`. The example is using the new remote module as it will
result in an error whereas the old `electron.remote` will not result an
exception, but instead the promise **will never resolve or reject**
