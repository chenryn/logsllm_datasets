The docker_manager_test needs some refactoring. A few of the problems:
  * Rampant code duplication (the test is over 2500 lines long)
  * Fragile tests depending on lots of internal functionality
Cleanup up the test properly may require exposing a few more interfaces from
the DockerManager, or just providing better fakes.
