Assistant: This log chunk shows the storage and execution of tasks related to the software component 'python.PythonRunner'. The storage.BlockManager found block rdd_2_1 locally, and the storage.MemoryStore stored blocks rdd_30_0-4 as bytes in memory. The executor.Executor finished tasks 0.0-4.0 in stage 22.0, each with a result size of 2667 bytes. The python.PythonRunner also recorded times for total, boot, init, and finish.
