periments. Finally, we present our experimental results and
discuss their implications.
A. Experimental Setup
Our experimental setup consists of an attacker (here, a
passive eavesdropper), a data transmitter and a friendly
jammer. Figure 10 shows a block schematic of the complete
setup and Table II summarizes the system parameters used
in the experiments. We further describe the details of our
setup below.
1) Data Source and Friendly Jammer: Two Universal
Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs) are used to emulate
the data transmitter (D) and the friendly jammer (J). Both
entities D and J transmit using 0 dB gain omni directional
antennas. A picture of the data-jammer setup is shown in
Figure 11. Each data packet is 67 bits long with a 29 bit
preamble. The preamble is chosen such that it has high
auto-correlation properties. Data is modulated using binary
frequency shift keying, i.e., 1’s and 0’s are transmitted using
two discrete frequencies. In our setup, the two frequencies
are separated by 100 KHz and upmixed to a RF carrier
frequency of 403 MHz. The jamming signal is generated by
modulating random bits, which results in a spectrum closely
matching the spectrum of the data signal (Figure 12). It is
ensured that the jamming signal is always transmitted with
at least 20 dB more power with respect to the data signal.
2) Attacker: The attacker is implemented using two omni
directional vertical antennas connected to an oscilloscope
(Figure 11). For the experiments, the two attacker antennas
were placed AB = {35, 50} cm apart. In the experimental
setup,
the attacker experiences multipath effects due to
reﬂection in the lab. Thus, the isosceles trapezoid formation
used in the LOS simulations does not necessarily provide
the optimal results. Consequentially, we allowed the attacker

bandpass-ﬁltered to exclude unwanted channel activity.
Then the power
the signals are normalized
to match the amplitudes. As the signals are dominated
by the jamming components,
this improves the match
of the two jamming components. The signals are then
phase-aligned by cross-correlating both the recorded signals
and determining the time lag between the two. Based on
the lag, one of the two received signals is appropriately
shifted. Since the jamming signal
is assumed to have
considerably higher power compared to the data signal,
the cross-correlation effectively aligns the jamming signal
components while keeping the existing phase difference
between the data signal components intact. Computing
the arithmetic difference between the two aligned signals
results in the recovered data signal—this recovered signal is
an attenuated or ampliﬁed copy of the original data signal
as described in Section III. Figure 13 shows the signals
received at the two attacker antennas and the recovered
data signal post alignment and subtraction. The transmitted
data is determined after appropriate synchronization and
FSK demodulation of the recovered data signal. If yA and
yB are the signals received at the attacker antennas A and
B, the stepwise Matlab implementation is summarized as
pseudo code in Table I.
B. Evaluation Metric
The attacker’s ability to successfully recover the data
signal is evaluated based on the bit error rate of the de-
modulated data from the received signal ˜y when compared
to original data in the transmitted signal sd. We express the
number of bit errors in the recovered data as a percentage
of data packet
length. In our experiments, we vary the
distance between the attacker and D, J, and the power
levels of the jamming signal relative to data signal. For each
conﬁguration, 15 different measurements were recorded and
the mean bit error rate computed.

C. Measurements and Analysis
In this section, we present our experimental results and
brieﬂy discuss their implications.
1) Effect of Attacker’s distance: As described in Sec-
tion III, the relative strength of the recovered data signal
degenerates as the distance of the attacker from D, J in-
creases. We experimentally verify our model and determine
the maximum distance at which an attacker can successfully
recover the data signal in real-world channel settings. The
power of the jamming signal is conﬁgured to be 20 dB
more than the data signal. For every distance between the
attacker and D, J,
two sets of measurements are taken
setting the spacing between the data and jammer antennas
to 15 cm and 30 cm. The results of our experiments are
shown in Figure 14(a). The results show that the attacker can
efﬁciently recover data for distances greater than one meter
by using a small antenna array with AB = 30 cm when the
data source and jammer are closer than λ/2. By increasing
AB to 50 cm, we were able to recover data with less than
20% BER from a distance of 4 m. For smaller values of DJ
or AB, the BER of the recovered data signal at the attacker
increases, as predicted in our simulation results presented in
Section III. Due to multipath effects in our lab environment,
we were not able to ﬁnd a good placement for the antennas
around d = 1.5 m.

2) Effect of Jamming Signal’s Power: In the next set of
experiments, we ﬁx the distance between the attacker and
D, J to 1 m and vary the relative power of the jamming
signal w.r.t the data signal. The jammer is conﬁgured to
transmit at {20, 25, 30, 35} dB more than the power of the
data signal. Two sets of measurements with the jammer
placed at DJ = {15, 30} cm from the data transmitter is
taken. For all the measurements, the spacing between the
attacker antennas were ﬁxed at AB = 50 cm. The results of
our experiments is shown in Figure 14(b). We observe that
for DJ = 30 cm, the attacker is able to recover 80% of the
data even with a relative jamming signal power of 30 dB.
However, for DJ = 15 cm, the bit error rate (BER) at the
attacker reaches almost 50%.
This shows that
the jamming signal
is not canceled
perfectly by the attacker. We estimate that this effect is due
to three possible sources of error: (i) imperfect alignment
of the jamming signals before cancellation, (ii) slightly
different channels for both receiving antennas in our real
world scenario, and (iii) uncorrelated receiving noise at the
receivers (the w we ignored earlier). Nevertheless, it can be
observed that our attack works in a number of scenarios.
3) For DJ (cid:6) λ/2: In order to evaluate the attacker’s
effectiveness in separating the data from the jamming signal
when D and J are placed in very close proximity, we
experimented with DJ = 5 cm (i.e, DJ at-least an order
of magnitude less than λ). We observed BERs close to
50% at distances greater than 1 m when using two omni-
directional antennas. However, with directional log-periodic
antennas [26] we were able to fully recover the data signal
from distances as far as 3 m from DJ.
4) In NLOS Conditions: In this set of experiments, we
evaluate the ability of an attacker to recover messages in
scenarios where there is no LOS between the attacker and
170
the data transmitter. We simulated this setup by sandwiching
the data transmitting antenna (D) between 4 cm of ground
beef and a thin (1 cm) layer of bacon. Since there is no
restriction on the type of antenna an attacker can use, we
used directional log-periodic antennas for additional gain
and to minimize multipath channel effects. The attacker
antennas were placed at distances {0.5, 1, 2} m away from
D and J. The jamming signal was ensured to be at-least
20 dB more than the data signal. While our experimental
setup resembles the setting from [11], we note that there
are several differences. In particular, we use an USRP [27]
to generate the data signals instead of an IMD. In addition,
we use a different process to generate the spectrum-shaped
jamming signal.
Figure 15 shows the BER observed at the attacker for
various orientations of attacker antennas A and B keeping
his distance d a ﬁxed value. Even though the BER varies for
different orientations (which is expected due to non-static
channel conditions), the attacker was still able to recover
90% of the data in certain locations. This shows that there
are indeed constellations in space where the conﬁdentiality
of data is breached under NLOS conditions. An exhaustive
analysis of effects of NLOS multipath channels on friendly
jamming schemes is left for future work.
V. DISCUSSION
In this section, we reﬂect on the results of the previous
sections and discuss possible extensions and related topics.
We start with the impact of medium BER attacks, discuss
the impact of multiple friendly jammers, possible counter-
measures, effects of SNR and multipath, and future work.
A. Placement of the Antennas
So far, we have not discussed how the attacker should
place his antennas to perform the attack. While ﬁnding
positions for A and B such that δ = π is easy in the
LOS setting without multipath, in real-world scenarios this
would require exact knowledge of channel conditions. Nev-
ertheless, we note that we were able to ﬁnd good enough
placements for the antennas in our experiments relatively
easily, as the attacker can often still demodulate the data
signal with δ < π/2 and less. Our setting differs from
traditional benign communication scenarios in the sense that
