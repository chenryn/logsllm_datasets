Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript it should be possible to compile
ES6 code without errors.
This valid ES6 snippets throws the following error:
    Error:(3, 14) TS2339: Property 'weight' does not exist on type 'Car'.
    class Car {
        constructor(weight) {
            this.weight = weight;
        }
    }
Is this a bug or a 'feature'?
