It sounds like you are experiencing an issue where changes to your web service classes are not being reflected in the browser when using the Bottle framework with CGI. This is a common problem during development, as the server may be serving a cached version of your code.

To address this, you can use the `reloader` option provided by the Bottle framework. The `reloader` automatically restarts the server whenever you make and save changes to your code. Hereâ€™s how you can enable it:

```python
from bottle import run

# Your other code here...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run(reloader=True)
```

By setting `reloader=True`, the server will automatically restart whenever you modify and save any of your Python files. This should ensure that your changes are immediately visible in the browser.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your setup, and I'll be happy to help further.
