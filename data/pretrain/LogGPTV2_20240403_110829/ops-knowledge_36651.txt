User: I have a python web service. My problem is when I changed my web service classes. I can't see the changes on the browser and I see last version of web service on the browser all the time.
I used Bottle framework and cgi.
Assistant: You need to restart the Bottle app after each change.  Doing this manually during development is a pain in the neck.  Fortunately Bottle provides a way to automate via a "reloader" option to the Run method:



run(reloader=True)



When you edit & save a module file, the reloader will restart the server process for you.
