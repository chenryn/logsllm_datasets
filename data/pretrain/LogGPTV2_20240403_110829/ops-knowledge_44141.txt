User: Is it possible to install 32-bit Python (2.7 series) on Windows 7/8 64-bit to develop 32-bit applications?  I'm sure the answer is yes but be good to get confirmation.
Assistant: You can install almost any 32 bit software on 64 bit Windows because it has a built-in 32 bit emulator. 
If you are going to use a 32 bit Python, make sure all the libraries you use are 32 bit too.
