the “favorable” main channel, it can be assumed that any
codeword sent by the sender is correctly received by the re-
ceiver. The wiretap codes can be eﬃciently implemented as
follows [19].
Let C0 be an (n, n − k) low-density parity-check (LDPC)
code with a generator matrix G ∈ GF (2)(n−k)×n and a
parity-check matrix H ∈ GF (2)k×n. Under a BEC chan-
n has a threshold ∗ ≥ 
nel, assume C0 with rate r = n−k
to ensure reliability. The encoder maps a k-bit message
M to a n-bit codeword X as X = (GT
G1 ∈ GF (2)k×n is composed of k independent row vec-
tors chosen from {0, 1}n\C0, and V ∈ GF (2)n−k is chosen
uniformly at random. The decoder recovers the message
as M = H1X, where H1 is generated from H. As can be
seen from the above encoding process, one coset code of C0
(which has 2k coset codes) is chosen for every message M,
and the use of V is to choose one codeword from this coset
code. Obviously, 2k possible M’s are corresponding to 2k
possible coset codes. Given its observation Z, which is the
erasured version of X, the eavesdropper’s uncertainty about
M can be ensured if all cosets of C0 are consistent with Z
and they contain the same number of codewords that agree
with Z in the unerased bits. It has been proved in [19] that
when G is the parity-check matrix with an erasure threshold
∗ > 1 − , the leakage rate to the eavesdropper is bounded
n L(Cn) ≤ δ(n), where δ(n) approaches zero as n goes
by 1
to inﬁnity.
It is easy to see that this wiretap code has a
typical binning structure [19] and its security guarantee is
n L(Cn) ≤ ε. In coding theory, a code that
consistent with 1
satisﬁes 1 − r = ∗ is called a capacity-achieving code. Note
that this wiretap code established under the noiseless main
channel does not rely on any capacity-achieving property.
However, the price paid is that the rates arbitrarily close to
the secrecy capacity cannot be achieved.
2.2.2 Type-II Code: Secrecy Codes for Binary Era-
sure Main Channel and Eavesdropper’s Chan-
nel
We move on to another wiretap channel model, in which
the main channel and the eavesdropper’s channel are both
binary erasure channels, with erasure probabilities m and
e (m  0, it is
possible to provide the communication security and reliabil-
ity guarantee no matter how the channel state changes over
time. Note that, our experimental results also indicate that
unless the environment changes dramatically, the movement
of people and objects does not aﬀect the thresholds much.
In the real world, potential eavesdroppers can always be
considered to be located at some restricted areas, and the
legitimate communicating parties are not likely to talk with
each other unless the potential eavesdropper is kept at an
alert area. As can be seen from the discussion above, the
solution of characterizing restricted zones for Eve under the
worst channel case does not require the knowledge of the
