I.  RATIONALE 
Cyber  attacks have become  surprisingly  sophisticated over 
the past fifteen years. While early infections mostly targeted 
individual machines, recent threats leverage the widespread 
network  connectivity  to  develop  complex  and  highly 
coordinated attacks involving several distributed nodes [1]. 
Attackers are currently targeting very diverse domains, e.g., 
e-commerce 
systems,  corporate  networks,  datacenter 
facilities  and  industrial  systems,  to  achieve  a  variety  of 
objectives,  which  range  from  credentials  compromise  to 
sabotage  of  physical  devices,  by  means  of  smarter  and 
smarter worms and rootkits. Stuxnet is a recent worm that 
well emphasizes the strong technical advances achieved by 
the  attackers’  community.  It  was  discovered  in  July  2010 
and  firstly  affected  Iranian  nuclear  plants  [2].  Stuxnet 
compromises the regular behavior of the supervisory control 
and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  by  reprogramming 
the  code  of  programmable  logic  controllers  (PLC).  Once 
compromised,  PLCs  can  progressively  destroy  a  device 
(e.g.,  components  of  a  centrifuge,  such  as  the  case  of  the 
Iranian plant) by sending malicious control signals. Stuxnet 
combines  a  relevant  number  of  challenging  features:  it 
exploits  zero-days  vulnerabilities  of  the  Windows  OS  to 
affect the nodes connected to the PLC; it propagates either 
locally (e.g., by means of USB sticks) or remotely (e.g., via 
shared folders or the print spooler vulnerability); it is able to 
modify its behavior during the progression of the attack, and 
communicates with a remote  command and control server. 
More importantly, Stuxnet can remain undetected for many 
months [3] because it is able to fool the SCADA system by 
emulating regular monitoring signals.  
The  novelty  of  a  Stuxnet-like  attack  model  is  the 
impairment of the monitoring and  control  system, which 
plays a critical role to ensure proper operations of a variety 
of systems, including industrial processes/plants, smart grids 
[4],  and  data  centers  of  a  grid-  or  cloud-computing 
infrastructure. Attacking a SCADA system can definitively 
lead to severe consequences, both economical and societal. 
For  example,  what  if  an  attacker  overloads  a  power 
distribution system by breaking into a power grid? What if 
environmental  sensors  of  a  cloud  facility  are  maliciously 
compromised? Stuxnet has shown that SCADA systems are 
vulnerable 
that  attackers  may 
to  cyber  attacks,  and

physically damage critical infrastructures in the near future. 
Nevertheless, it is hard to tell whether there is a real chance 
to  fully  secure  a  SCADA  system:  as  for  regular  computer 
systems,  the  variety  of  monitoring  and  control  hardware/ 
software  components  (e.g.,  sensors,  actuators,  OSs,  PLCs 
management  tools)  is  inherently  vulnerable  because  of 
residual  exploits,  intentional  misuse,  or  bad  operator 
practices (such as plugging in an infected media or writing 
down a password).  
This  work  discusses  the  role  of  diversity  as  a  mean 
towards  secure  monitoring  and  control.  The  intuition 
underlying the proposal is that diversity can be leveraged to 
raise  the  effort  it  takes  to  conduct  a  successful  attack  (in 
terms of attack resources and time) to such a level so as to 
make it pointless to attempt an attack at all. For example, 
let  us  consider  an  attack  that  requires  compromising  two 
machines  in  order  to  be  successful.  If  the  machines  are 
identical,  it  suffices  to  compromise  one  machine  and  then 
repeating  the  exploit  for  the  other,  i.e.,  the  chance  of  a 
successful attack PSA to the system is related to the chance 
of  compromising  just  one  machine  (PSA≈PM).  When  the 
machines  are  different,  PSA  is  smaller  because  it  becomes 
somewhat related to chance of compromising each machine 
separately  (i.e.,  PSA≈PM1×PM2):  succeeding  is  harder  and 
time-consuming.  Diversity  is  not  used  here  to  replicate 
components.  We  claim  that  a  monitoring  and  control 
system,  when  possible,  can  smartly  combine  diverse 
technologies to significantly increase the effort to conduct a 
successful  attack.  Key  aspects,  issues  and  future  research 
directions are briefly discussed in the following. 
II.  ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY 
Diversity  is  a  valuable  mean  to  achieve  the  mentioned 
objective;  however,  the  complex  nature  and  dynamics  of 
Stuxnet-like  attacks  make  it  difficult  to  assess  the  actual 
impact  of  diversity  from  a  cyber  security  perspective.  We 
propose  a 
three-step  attack  modeling  and  evaluation 
approach  (i)  to  identify  the  components  that  can  be 
potentially diversified in a given SCADA system, and (ii) to 
evaluate to what extent a given diversity degree can actually 
impact  the  effort  it  takes  to  fulfill  an  attack.  The  proposal 
drives  a  balanced  approach  between  secure  system  design 
and  diversification  costs.  Fig.  1  depicts  the  steps  of  the 
proposed modeling and evaluation approach.

indicators.  To  this  aim,  we  plan  to  use  ANalysis  Of 
VAriance  (ANOVA)  techniques,  which  make  it  possible 
to  allocate  the  variability  of  the  security  indicators 
(measured  across  the  different  system  configurations 
established  in  the  previous  step)  to  the  component(s) 
responsible 
for  such  variability.  This  step  allows 
identifying  the  system  HW/SW  components  that  impact 
security  indicators,  and  thus  valuable  to  diversify  in  the 
real system implementation.  
We  are  in  the  process  of  instantiating  the  proposed 
framework  to  assess  the  resilience  against  Stuxnet-like 
attacks  of  the  cooling  system  of  the  SCoPE  data  center  at 
the Federico II University of Naples (www.scope.unina.it). 
A  system  model  encompassing  control/monitoring  nodes 
and  PLCs  has  been  developed  by  means  of  the  stochastic 
activity  networks 
formalism.  A  preliminary 
sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  use  of  a  small, 
strategically  distributed,  number  of  highly  attack-resilient 
components can significantly lower the chance of bringing a 
successful attack to the system.

III.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
We discussed the principles underlying a modeling and 
evaluation approach conceived to support a diversity-based 
design  for  more  secure  monitoring  and  control  in  a 
distributed  system.  We  aim  to  improve  the  approach  both 
from  the  attack-  and  system-perspective  by  introducing  a 
wider set of threat models, such as Duqu and Flame, and by 
modeling  the  impact  of  a  wider  set  of  components,  e.g., 
sensors,  actuators,  firewall.    The  approach  will  be  used  to 
assess  and  improve  attack-resiliency  of  real-world  critical 
infrastructures.

The  goal  of  the  proposal  is  to  estimate  how  a  set  of 
security-oriented  indicators varies when diverse HW/SW 
components  are  used  in  the  system.  Example  of  security 
indicators are: (i) Time-To-Attack, i.e., the time between the 
beginning  and  completion  of  an  attack;  (ii)  Time-To-
Security-Failure [5], i.e., the time between the beginning of 
the  attack  and  the  perceived  attack  manifestation;  (iii) 
compromised  ratio,  i.e.,  the  number  of  compromised 
components  at  time  t  with  respect  to  the  total  number  of 
components. Key characteristics of each step are:  
(cid:131) Attack  Modeling.  Progression  of  an  attack,  in  terms  of 
the  stages  the  attack  undergoes  before  success  (e.g., 
initial, activated, root access, network propagation, device 
impairment) is formalized by means of a model. Potential 
modeling  approaches  include,  for  example,  Bayesian 
networks,  Petri-nets,  or  attack  trees.  For  each  stage,  we 
identify  the  system  HW/SW  components  (e.g.,  OS, 
firewall, programs, devices) that impact the probability of 
the  attack  to  move  to  the  next  progression  stage.  For 
example, the chance to accomplish the sample root access 
stage may depend on the underlying OS version; similarly, 
the device compromise stage might be harder to fulfill if 
the  device  targeted  by  the  attack  is  someway  resilient  to 
malicious control signals.  
(cid:131) Design  of  Experiments  (DoE)  &  Measurements.  We 
assess  security  indicators  when  diverse  components  are 
introduced in the system. Impact of diversity is emulated 
by  varying  the  success  probabilities  involved  at  each 
attack  stage.  For  instance,  the  root  access  stage  might 
have a success probability P1 when operating system OS1 
is  used,  or  P2  in  case  OS2  is  used  (P1≠P2).  Probability 
values reflect the availability of tools and/or exploits that 
can be leveraged to accomplish a given stage. Probability 
values  are  established  either  by  means  of  previously 
documented  attack  history,  or  by  emulating  malware 
samples in a controlled environment (e.g., honeypots), or 
by  performing  a  sensitivity  analysis.  Given  the  large 
number  of  HW/SW  components  that  can  be  potentially 
diversified  in  a  real  system,  the  choices  of  probability 
values and related combinations, measurement of security 
indicators  is  driven  by  a  DoE  approach.  DoE  allows 
narrowing the number of configurations to assess. Security 
indicators  are  measured  by  running  the  attack  model 
against each configuration identified by means of DoE.
