the 6 topologies with different failure guarantees. All computation
is done using a single Linux machine with commodity hardware
conﬁguration (2.33 GHz CPU, 4 GB memory). We employ ILOG
CPLEX 10.0 [8] as the linear program solver. Table 2 summa-
rizes the results. We observe that the precomputation time ﬂuctu-
ates with the number of failures and is typically below half an hour.
This is because the complexity of the linear program (7) is inde-
pendent of the number of failures. In contrast, explicit enumeration
of failure scenarios can quickly become prohibitive as the number
of failures increases.
Storage and MPLS overhead: One concern about R3 protection
implementation based on MPLS-ff is router storage overhead (i.e.,
FIB and RIB size), given that routers need to maintain the pro-
tection labels for all protected links and store local copies of the
protection routing p.
To evaluate the storage overhead, for a given topology, we run R3
MPLS-ff protection assuming that all backbone links are protected
