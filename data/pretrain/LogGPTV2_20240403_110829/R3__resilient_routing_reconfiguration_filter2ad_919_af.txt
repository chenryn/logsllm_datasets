### Evaluation of Network Topologies and Failure Guarantees

We evaluated six different topologies with varying failure guarantees. All computations were performed on a single Linux machine with standard hardware configuration (2.33 GHz CPU, 4 GB memory). We utilized ILOG CPLEX 10.0 [8] as the linear program solver. The results are summarized in Table 2.

**Precomputation Time:**
We observed that the precomputation time varies with the number of failures but generally remains below half an hour. This is because the complexity of the linear program (7) is independent of the number of failures. In contrast, explicit enumeration of failure scenarios can become computationally prohibitive as the number of failures increases.

### Storage and MPLS Overhead

One concern with R3 protection implementation based on MPLS-ff is the router storage overhead, specifically the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) and Routing Information Base (RIB) size. Routers need to maintain protection labels for all protected links and store local copies of the protection routing paths.

To evaluate the storage overhead, we ran R3 MPLS-ff protection assuming that all backbone links are protected. The results are detailed in the following sections.

### Network Performance under Multiple Link Failures

We analyzed the network performance under multiple link failures using R3 protection. The performance metrics include normalized throughput, normalized link load, and aggregated loss rate at egress routers. The results are presented in Figures 8 and 11.

These results provide insights into the effectiveness of R3 protection in maintaining network performance under various failure scenarios.
