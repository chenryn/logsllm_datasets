Question: In the context of mitigating SYN flood attacks, how do SYN cookies help to protect a server from being overwhelmed by fake connection requests? Choose all that apply.
"A": "SYN cookies encode the connection state within the sequence number, which is returned by the client, thus preventing the server from needing to allocate memory prematurely.",
"B": "SYN cookies encrypt the data transferred during the TCP handshake, ensuring that only legitimate clients can decrypt and continue the connection.",
"C": "SYN cookies restrict the number of SYN packets a single IP address can send, thus limiting the potential of flooding from a spoofed address.",
"D": "SYN cookies allow the server to verify the client's state using a secret before allocating state for the connection."
