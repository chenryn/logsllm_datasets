User: I have this program Namechange.py which changes names from files (always cuts some useless end). Everything works fine, but I use this file a lot in a lot of different directories, which is bothersome when I want to change something. What I'm searching for is a python script which
let's me execute this script in a directory I choose.
My first idea was that I run another script which copies Namechange.py 
in the desired directory and then executes it there and deletes it after
everythings finished. The copying part works. 
Till now I tried using symlink ( it just executed the script in the working directory :D) as well as the subprocess module, which says there is no such directory when I use:

subprocess.call(["cd", newpath])

newpath is the absolute path to the directory I want to use the script.
with error OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory.
If somebody has a elegant way to achieve this I would be glad.
Thanks and goodbye
Assistant: Things you use from anywhere should be reachable from anywhere.
That's where the system's PATH environment variable comes in.
You should either move your script to a directory in the PATH, or extend the PATH with the location of your script.
Note:
make sure the script works location-independently: use sys.path extensively, try to use sys.path.join(base, sub) where possible etc...
