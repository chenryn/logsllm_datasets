### Leveraging Rich Distributional Semantics for Incident Search and Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

**Introduction:**
Our approach leverages the rich distributional semantics of natural language to enable Incident Search and Root Cause Analysis (RCA). This is achieved through the extraction of Incident Causal Analysis (ICA) and causal mining, which are essential for RCA. A key contribution is the construction of a Causal Knowledge Graph (CKG) from unstructured incident data, a task that differs significantly from traditional causal graph construction methods [16, 27, 32] based on structured call traces or system dependency graphs.

**Motivation-2: PRBs as Oracle Root Cause Knowledge Source:**
Traditional RCA pipelines heavily rely on data sources such as application or error logs [9, 11, 20, 30, 31], execution traces [16â€“18, 28], and time series of KPI metrics [4, 21, 26, 27]. Discovering root-cause-related signals in these data sources can be a complex and time-consuming task. In contrast, past incident investigations documented by domain experts are a rich source of Oracle Root Cause Information, containing explicit linguistic cues that link incident symptoms to expert-recommended root causes and resolutions. While in their raw form, these long, unstructured documents are not suitable for knowledge reuse, NLP techniques can process them into a structured form amenable to AI models.

**Motivation-3: Handling Repeated Incidents:**
A repeated incident is one with similar symptoms, root causes, and resolutions to any past incident. We quantitatively define the extent of repeatedness as the maximum obtainable word overlap of the concatenated fields when compared to all past incidents. Figure 2(a) shows the timeline of quarterly counts of all and various degrees of repeated incidents, indicating that repeated incidents persist consistently over time. Figure 2(b) shows that the distribution of incident severity (Sev1/Sev2) is similar across repeated and non-repeated incidents, suggesting that repeated incidents require as much attention as non-repeated ones. Figure 2(c) indicates that the distribution of incident resolution times (and their mean) is also similar across repeated and non-repeated incidents, largely due to the lack of a framework for reusing knowledge from past investigations.

**Challenges:**
1. **Long Unstructured Documentation of PRBs:** We need to handle the long, unstructured content in PRBs, which often contains irrelevant and distracting information.
2. **Unsupervised Setting:** We must tackle this complex, domain-specific problem in an unsupervised setting using generic pre-trained or unsupervised NLP models, with minimal assumptions about the nature of PRB documents.

**Our Approach:**

**Incident Causation Analysis (ICA) Pipeline:**
The ICA pipeline, illustrated in Figure 3, consists of the following main components:
1. **Offline Neural Information Extraction from Unstructured Data:**
   - **Symptom Extraction:** A rule-based module extracts the generic symptom from the PRB subject, removing specific host machine details.
   - **Key Topic Extraction:** An ensemble of unsupervised topic models [3] extracts short topical phrases most representative of the document. This includes graphical topic models like TextRank, SingleRank, TopicRank, Topical PageRank, PositionRank, MultipartiteRank, feature-based model YAKE, and neural embedding-based SIFRank using pre-trained ELMo.
   - **Root Cause & Resolution Extraction:** Pretrained Transformers fine-tuned on Machine Reading Comprehension tasks (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, SpanBERT) extract targeted spans containing crisp root causes and resolution information. For root cause extraction, we use queries like "What was the root cause of SYMPTOM?" and for resolution extraction, queries like "What was done to remedy the SYMPTOM?"

2. **Neural Knowledge Mining:**
   - **Causal Knowledge Graph (CKG) Construction:** The CKG aggregates document-level information extracted in the form of symptoms, root causes, and resolutions. It enables visualization of the causal structure underlying incidents and plays a key role in predicting likely root causes and resolutions given a symptom. The CKG is stored in Neo4j, allowing interactive visualization and efficient querying.

3. **Using Causal Knowledge Graph for RCA:**
   - **Global Incident Analysis:** The CKG provides interactive visualization and intuitive navigation over the underlying structure of symptoms, root causes, and resolutions, serving as a post-mortem analysis tool.
   - **Incident-specific Analysis:** Users can extract relevant subgraphs or navigate local clusters of related root causes or similar symptoms.
   - **Root Cause or Resolution Prediction from Symptom:** The CKG leverages its graphical structure to infer root causes or resolutions from past investigations. We frame these as two independent tasks: i) Root Cause Prediction and ii) Resolution Prediction, given the symptom.

**Step-by-Step CKG Construction:**
1. **Clustering Symptoms:** Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering techniques [23] are applied to hierarchically cluster symptoms, merging them by minimizing the sum of squared distances within all clusters.
2. **Clustering Root Causes and Resolutions:** Global and local Affinity Propagation [23] based clustering is applied to root causes and resolutions, creating global and local cluster heads.
3. **Cluster Labeling:** For each cluster, a document is constructed by concatenating all node labels, and a collocation extraction technique [25] is used to select the longest n-grams with the highest Pointwise Mutual Information.

**3.4 Incident Search and Retrieval-based RCA:**
After a new incident occurs and its key symptoms are identified, the core Incident Management task is to efficiently search over past incidents. Our ICA modules cater to this goal by enabling:
- **Neural Information Retrieval System:** A system to search and rank the most relevant past incidents with similar symptoms.
- **Retrieval-based RCA:** A simple yet effective method to detect the most likely root causes and resolutions based on past investigations.

By succinctly representing and consuming RCA knowledge from past investigations, ICA provides an ideal framework for novice SREs to quickly get onboarded into the RCA process and acquire the knowledge of more experienced SREs. In the future, infrastructures like the Causal Knowledge Graph may enable discovering RCA insights over multimodal, multi-sourced data like logs, execution traces, and time series metrics.

**Conclusion:**
Our approach addresses the challenges of handling long, unstructured PRB documentation and the need for an unsupervised setting by leveraging advanced NLP techniques and constructing a Causal Knowledge Graph. This framework not only enhances the efficiency and accuracy of RCA but also facilitates knowledge reuse and onboarding of new SREs.
