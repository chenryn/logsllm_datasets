User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题404 error with nginx and wordpress My wordpress site has been working fine for sometime with nginx and wordpress. But for some reason it is now giving me a 404 error. I think this may be related to the quick-cache plugin which I recently updated. Although I'm not 100% sure about this. 

To setup wp-nginx I following these instructions. So far I've done the following


deleted my plugin directory 
removed reference to quick-cache from wp-config.php /wp-content folder 
checked my nginx config which is below


However after restarting I still get the same 404 error. Would anyone know what could be wrong..?

server {
    listen   80;


    root /var/www;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    server_name mysite.com;

    location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?q=$uri&amp;$args;
    }

    error_page 404 /404.html;

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
          root /var/www;
    }

    # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on the php-fpm socket
    location ~ \.php$ {
            try_files $uri =404;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            include fastcgi_params;
    }


}

Assistant: Your config is not okay.

Here is working WordPress config file.

server {
                listen 80;
