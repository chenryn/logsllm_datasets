## Abstract
The .com, .net, and .org top-level domains (TLDs) contain approximately 150 million registered domains, and domain registrants often struggle to find desirable and available names. In 2013, ICANN began delegating a new wave of TLDs into the Domain Name System to improve meaningful name choice for registrants. This rollout resulted in over 500 new TLDs in the first 18 months, nearly tripling the number of TLDs. Previous rollouts of small numbers of new TLDs have led to defensive registrations as companies protect their trademarks. This paper analyzes the types of domain registrations in the new TLDs to determine registrant behavior in this new naming landscape. We also examine the cost structures and monetization models for the new TLDs to identify which registries are profitable. Our analysis, based on DNS, Web, and WHOIS data, combined with cost structure data from ICANN, the registries, and domain registrars, suggests that only 15% of domains in the new TLDs show characteristics consistent with primary registrations, while the rest are promotional, speculative, or defensive in nature. Additionally, 16% of domains with NS records do not resolve, and 32% are parked. Financially, only half of the registries have earned enough to cover their application fees, and 10% of current registries likely never will solely from registration revenue.

## 1. Introduction
A strong internet presence, often anchored by a memorable domain name, is crucial for most successful companies today. While an almost infinite set of possible domain names exists, any given name is unique, and memorable names can command high prices. The Domain Name System (DNS) initially included only a few TLDs, and ICANN has kept the number low until recently. The benefits of new TLDs seem clear: simple and memorable strings, long since taken in older TLDs, become available again under a new namespace. However, many registrations in new TLDs are defensive, with brand or trademark owners trying to protect their names.

Starting in 2013, ICANN began delegating a new wave of TLDs. Unlike previous TLDs, which were debated independently and over multiple ICANN board meetings, TLDs in the new program go through a standard application process. This expansion has resulted in a rapid increase in the TLD namespace: from 318 TLDs in October 2013 to 897 TLDs by April 2015.

This paper examines the impact of the New gTLD Program on the domain name ecosystem. Previous TLD additions, such as .biz and .xxx, caused widespread speculation and defensive registrations. With hundreds of new TLDs, we expect smaller companies to find it infeasible to defend their names in each. Additionally, the sharp increase in simple-word second-level domains could make it difficult for speculators to resell even desirable names. The program's success also depends on how internet users view the new domains. Do consumers see TLDs as interchangeable, or will new TLDs discourage users from visiting associated domains?

To answer these questions, we make the following contributions:
- We classify registration intent using a methodology derived from our work on .xxx. Applying this methodology to the New gTLD Program presented additional scaling difficulties, requiring further automation of domain analysis.
- We determine the program’s impact on old TLDs, both on registration rates and on the types of registrations.
- We examine registry profitability to learn where the registration money goes and what kinds of TLDs get the most registrations.

Our findings suggest that the new gTLDs have yet to provide value to the internet community in the same way as legacy TLDs. Although the new TLDs greatly expand the domain name space, speculative and defensive registrations dominate. For domains that resolve with some kind of content, over 45% are speculative, nearly 40% are defensive, and less than 15% host primary web content. Users visit new domains in the new TLDs less frequently, and new TLD domains are more than twice as likely to appear on a blacklist within the first month of registration. Finally, the new TLDs have yet to significantly impact the old TLDs. Registrations in the new TLDs generally increase the total number of registrations, but .com continues to dominate internet domain name registration activity overall.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 The Domain Name System (DNS)
The DNS maps human-readable names to machine addresses. ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, oversees the DNS and holds the authority for establishing new TLDs. After minor TLD additions in the previous decade (e.g., .biz, .info, .mobi, .xxx), ICANN initiated a new process in 2008 to normalize the policies for creating new gTLDs. The first new gTLD was delegated in late 2013. The complexity and potential for conflict involved in this process reflect the significant stakeholder range.

### 2.2 Key Actors in the DNS Ecosystem
- **Registries**: Operate TLDs and have a contract with ICANN for each one.
- **Registrars**: Sell domain names, typically in many different TLDs, and have an ICANN accreditation.
- **Registrants**: Entities that buy domain names.

### 2.3 The Delegation Process
ICANN formalized a detailed application process for those seeking to sponsor new TLDs, which includes a USD 185,000 evaluation fee. Applications undergo public comment, review by government interests, and interested stakeholders. If multiple applications pursue the same TLD, the process may include extended evaluation, dispute resolution, or a contention period, increasing fees. Large organizations, such as Google, Amazon, and Donuts, are favored due to the significant capital required.

Applicants whose submissions survive evaluation transition to the "delegation" phase, where the TLD is entered into the root DNS server zones. This phase involves contractual obligations and technical tests. Due to capacity constraints and changes in applicant business goals, there can be considerable delays between evaluation and delegation.

### 2.4 TLD Rollout
After delegation, the TLD life cycle depends on the registry. TLDs intended for public use have a sunrise phase, where only trademark holders can register. This is followed by a "land rush" phase, where registrants can get an earlier chance at any domain name for a premium price. Finally, there is a general availability phase, where registrations are first-come, first-served. Some TLDs, like .aramco, are private and closed to the public, intended only for the registry itself.

### 2.5 Examples
- **Donuts Inc.**: Manages hundreds of TLDs, largely consisting of topical English words. They secured over USD 100 million in venture capital.
- **.xyz TLD**: A generic alternative to .com, it became the largest in the new program. Network Solutions offered .xyz domains for free to some customers, leading to a rapid increase in registrations. However, many of these domains remain unused.
- **.science TLD**: Targets the scientific community and was offered for free by AlpNames, leading to a significant increase in registrations.
- **.realtor TLD**: Owned by the National Association of Realtors, it targets accredited realtors and requires membership proof. Many .realtor domains still show the default web template provided by the registrar.

## 3. Data and Infrastructure
### 3.1 Zone Files
When a registrant purchases a new domain, the registrar sends a request to the registry with the domain and name server information. Once the domain goes live, it appears in the TLD's zone file. ICANN requires most registries to provide zone file access for research purposes. We gained access to zone files for older TLDs by signing and faxing a paper contract to the TLD’s registry. For newer TLDs, ICANN developed the Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS), which simplifies the process. We download a new snapshot of each daily, totaling 3.8 GB of gzipped text, and store all NS, A, and AAAA records on our HDFS cluster.

### 3.2 ICANN Public Data
ICANN requires each registry to provide summary reports, including monthly transaction reports. These reports provide statistics about the number of domains registered, transferred, expired, and renewed for each accredited registrar. We use these reports to identify the number of registered domains without name server information and to estimate registration costs.

### 3.3 Our TLD Set
We include results for new TLDs that started general availability by January 31, 2015, totaling 502 new TLDs. Table 1 breaks down these new TLDs into various high-level categories, along with the total number of new domains registered at the time of our crawl.
