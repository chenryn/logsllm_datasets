ABSTRACT
1.
INTRODUCTION
The com, net, and org TLDs contain roughly 150 million regis-
tered domains, and domain registrants often have a difﬁcult time
ﬁnding a desirable and available name.
In 2013, ICANN began
delegation of a new wave of TLDs into the Domain Name Sys-
tem with the goal of improving meaningful name choice for regis-
trants. The new rollout resulted in over 500 new TLDs in the ﬁrst
18 months, nearly tripling the number of TLDs. Previous rollouts
of small numbers of new TLDs have resulted in a burst of defensive
registrations as companies aggressively defend their trademarks to
avoid consumer confusion. This paper analyzes the types of do-
main registrations in the new TLDs to determine registrant behav-
ior in the brave new world of naming abundance. We also exam-
ine the cost structures and monetization models for the new TLDs
to identify which registries are proﬁtable. We gather DNS, Web,
and WHOIS data for each new domain, and combine this with cost
structure data from ICANN, the registries, and domain registrars to
estimate the total cost of the new TLD program. We ﬁnd that only
15% of domains in the new TLDs show characteristics consistent
with primary registrations, while the rest are promotional, specu-
lative, or defensive in nature; indeed, 16% of domains with NS
records do not even resolve yet, and 32% are parked. Our ﬁnancial
analysis suggests only half of the registries have earned enough to
cover their application fees, and 10% of current registries likely
never will solely from registration revenue.

Nearly any successful company today needs a good Internet pres-
ence, and most see a memorable domain name as a key part of
that presence. Though a nearly inﬁnite set of possible domain
names exist, any given name is unique, and memorable names often
change hands for thousands or even millions of dollars. The Do-
main Name System (DNS) originally included only a small handful
of top-level domains (TLDs), and ICANN has kept that number low
until recent times. The beneﬁts of a new TLD seem obvious at ﬁrst
glance: simple and memorable strings, long since taken in the older
TLDs, become available again under a new namespace. However,
many registrations in new TLDs go towards defensive registrations,
brand or trademark owners trying to protect their names.
Starting in 2013, delegation began of a whole new wave of TLDs.
Whereas ICANN debated the inclusion of previous TLDs indepen-
dently and over the course of multiple ICANN board meetings,
TLDs in the new program go through a standard application process
which does not include ICANN-wide attention. The new expansion
has resulted in a swift expansion of the TLD namespace: on Octo-
ber 1, 2013, shortly before the beginning of the program, the root
zone contained 318 TLDs, mostly country code TLDs (ccTLDs).
As of April 15, 2015, the root zone contained 897 TLDs, an expan-
sion of 579 TLDs in less than two years.
This paper identiﬁes the impact of the New gTLD Program on
the domain name ecosystem. Previous TLD additions, such as
biz [12] and xxx [11], caused widespread speculation and defen-
sive registrations, but this larger expansion could discourage both.
With hundreds of new TLDs, we expect many smaller companies
to ﬁnd it infeasible to defend their name in each. Additionally, such
a sharp increase in simple-word second-level domains could make
it difﬁcult for speculators to resell even desirable names. The pro-
gram’s success also depends on how Internet users view the new
domains. Do consumers see TLDs as interchangeable, or will new
TLDs discourage users from visiting the associated domain? To
answer these questions, we make the following contributions:
• We classify registration intent with a methodology derived
from our work on xxx [11]. The application of the methodol-
ogy to the New gTLD Program presented additional scaling
difﬁculties, most notably requiring further automation of do-
main analysis. Our main contribution is the timely result of
this methodology applied to the TLD landscape during its
current period of swift expansion.
• We determine the program’s impact on the old TLDs, both
on registration rates and on the types of registrations.
• We examine registry proﬁtability to learn where the reg-
istration money goes and what kinds of TLDs get the most
registrations.
Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that the new gTLDs have
yet to provide value to the Internet community in the same way as
legacy TLDs. Although the new TLDs greatly expand the domain
name space, overall we ﬁnd that speculative and defensive regis-
trations dominate the growth of registrations in new TLDs. For
domains that resolve with some kind of content, over 45% are spec-
ulative in nature, nearly 40% are defensive, and less than 15% host
primary Web content. Users also visit new domains in the new
TLDs less frequently than in the old, and new TLD domains are
more than twice as likely to appear on a blacklist within the ﬁrst
month of registration. Finally, we also ﬁnd that the new TLDs have
yet to have signiﬁcant impact on the old TLDs. Registrations in
the new TLDs generally increase the number of total registrations,
and com continues to dominate Internet domain name registration
activity overall.
2. BACKGROUND
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the Internet service that
maps human-readable names to machine addresses. In the Inter-
net today, the DNS is overseen by the Internet Corporation for As-
signed Names and Numbers (ICANN), which holds the authority
for establishing new top-level domains (TLDs). After a number
of minor TLD additions in the decade previous (e.g., biz, info,
mobi, xxx), ICANN initiated a new process in 2008 to normalize
the policies for creating new gTLDs. In late 2013, the ﬁrst new
gTLD was delegated. The length of this process reﬂects the signiﬁ-
cant complexity involved, the range of stakeholders and the signif-
icant potential for conﬂict. In this section, we provide background
on how the domain name ecosystem works, how companies apply
for a TLD in the new program, and who the signiﬁcant players are.
There are three key actors in the DNS ecosystem:
Registries operate TLDs and have a contract with ICANN
for each one.
Registrars sell domain names, typically in many different
TLDs, and also have an ICANN accreditation.
Registrants are entities that buy domain names.
and our goal in this paper is to explore how these actors have re-
acted to the rapid expansion of the DNS name space.
2.1 The Delegation Process
In preparation for the expansion, ICANN formalized a detailed
application process for those seeking to sponsor new TLDs (well
over 300 pages in English) [19]. Each applicant prepared an exten-
sive submission covering business, technical and operational issues
and paid a USD 185,000 evaluation fee for the initial evaluation.
These applications in turn were open to public comment and for re-
view by government interests and interested stakeholders. In such
cases, the TLD might undergo extended evaluation, dispute resolu-
tion, or a contention period when multiple applications pursue the
same TLD (and in such cases the fees could increase considerably).
With the addition of legal fees, drafting fees, data escrow fees, auc-
tions for contested names and operational costs, applications for a
new gTLD require signiﬁcant capital and thus favor those large or-
ganizations (e.g., Google, Amazon, Donuts) who would amortize
these expenses across many such applications.
Those applicants whose submission survived evaluation transi-
tioned to a phase called “delegation” (when the TLD is entered into
the zones of the root DNS servers) subject to a series of contractual
obligations (e.g., a registry agreement with ICANN covering dis-
pute resolution, fees, technical standards, etc.) and technical tests.
Delegation marks the time when end users can ﬁrst resolve domains
under the new TLD and is thus a major milestone for any registry.
Due to capacity constraints inside ICANN and changes in applicant
business goals, there can be considerable delay between evaluation
and delegation.
2.2 TLD Rollout
After delegation, the TLD life cycle depends on the registry.
TLDs intended for public use have a sunrise phase, a period of
time during which only trademark holders may register. This phase
gives brand holders a ﬁrst chance to defend their names. Most
TLDs follow with a “land rush” phase where registrants can get
an earlier chance at any domain name for a price premium, usu-
ally on the order of a few hundred dollars. Finally, public TLDs
will have a general availability phase, where registrations become
ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-served, and registrants just pay the standard yearly
registration rate for most names. Though ICANN has some min-
imum length standards for the sunrise phase, the registry chooses
the exact length of sunrise, domain pricing and promotions, and all
of the details about the other introductory phases.
A subset of TLDs are never made available for public registra-
tion. For these private TLDs, the only intended registrant is the
registry itself, frequently to protect a brand mark. For example, the
TLD aramco is closed to the public and only Saudi Aramco and its
afﬁliates can operate domains under this TLD.
2.3 Examples
The data for this paper comes from hundreds of new TLDs, many
of them managed by unique registries. We cannot describe all ac-
tors due to space limitations, but this section describes some of the
larger registries and their TLDs.
2.3.1 Donuts
Though most registries run one or a small handful of new TLDs,
Donuts Inc. is the largest and manages hundreds. Their TLDs
largely consist of topical English words, such as “singles”, “dig-
ital”, and “coffee”. The company’s founders each have years of
experience in the domain name industry, and the company secured
over USD 100 million in venture capital [9]. Another large registry,
Rightside, runs the technical infrastructure for Donuts TLDs. In re-
turn, Donuts gives some of its TLDs to Rightside after they reach
delegation.
2.3.2 The xyz TLD
The xyz TLD is a generic alternative to com and is the largest
in the new program. In the middle of 2014, Network Solutions, a
large registrar, began offering xyz domains for free to some of their
customers on an opt-out basis (e.g., the owner of example.com
would ﬁnd the domain example.xyz had appeared in their ac-
count). While registrants received these domains for free, Network
Solutions still paid the registry full price for each domain [16, 26],
although documents released as part of a lawsuit by Verisign sug-
gest Network Solutions may have paid for these domains with ad-
vertising credit [8].
Due to this promotion, the number of registered domains in xyz
rose by thousands per day in its earliest days until early August,
when the number of registrations slowed to around 428,806 do-
mains. Since then, xyz registrations appear at a much lower rate:
the number of domains ﬁnally doubled on April 13, 2015, taking
over eight months to register a number of domains that originally
took only two.
Registrants, however, appear to have only limited interest in these
free domains. In our data set, 351,457 xyz domains (46% of xyz)
remain unused and display a standard Network Solutions registra-
tion page when visited in a Web browser. Upon further analysis,
we ﬁnd that 351,440 of these domains appeared in the zone ﬁle in
its ﬁrst two months and still showed the unused Network Solutions
template six months later. In fact, 82% of the 428,806 xyz domains
in the August 2, 2014 zone ﬁle originated from this promotion and
remained unclaimed as of early February 3, 2015. According to the
monthly reports, Network Solutions had acted as registrar for only
360,683 xyz domains at the end of July, 2015, so registrants from
this promotion claimed fewer than 10,000 free domains in the ﬁrst
six months.
2.3.3 The science TLD
The science TLD allows generic registrations, but targets the
scientiﬁc community. Starting with general availability on Febru-
ary 24, 2015, the AlpNames registrar offered science TLDs for
free. Similar to xyz, this promotion appears to have signiﬁcantly
impacted the number of science registrations: within only a few
days, the TLD boasted 36,952 unique domains. The promotion
has since ended, but the AlpNames registrar still sells science
domains for $0.50, making it one of the cheapest TLDs. Two
months after the start of general availability it had 174,403 reg-
istrations. Even though general availability started after our cutoff
date, science is already the third largest TLD.
2.3.4 The realtor TLD
The National Association of Realtors owns the realtor TLD
and targets accredited realtors, but also requires all registrants to
prove that they are members of their association [22]. The reg-
istry provides the ﬁrst year of registration for free to anyone that
provides their NAR membership information. The promotion only
applies to a single domain per NAR membership number. 46,920
realtor domains (51%) still show the default Web template pro-
vided by the registrar.
3. DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE
We use data from many sources in our analysis, including zone
ﬁles and several reports from ICANN. We actively crawl Web and
DNS for each domain, and compare our ﬁndings with Alexa rank-
ings and various blacklists.
In this section we describe our data
sources and data collection infrastructure.
3.1 Zone Files
When a registrant purchases a new domain from a registrar, the
registrar sends a request to the registry with the domain and name
server information. Once the domain goes live, it will appear in that
TLD’s zone ﬁle. At a high level, a zone ﬁle reﬂects a snapshot of a
DNS server’s anticipated answers to DNS queries. For a domain to
resolve, it must have name server information in the zone ﬁle.
ICANN requires most registries to provide zone ﬁle access for
a variety of purposes, including research. Some registries, such as
most ccTLDs, do not need to provide access. For zones delegated
prior to 2013, we gained access to their zone ﬁles by signing and
faxing a paper contract to the TLD’s registry, each of which gave
us FTP credentials. We originally used this method to gain access
to aero, biz, com, info, name, net, org, us, and xxx.
In anticipation for the rapid TLD expansion, ICANN developed
a more scalable solution to zone ﬁle access requests, known as the
Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS). Registries and interested
third parties can all apply for accounts on the service. After ﬁlling
out their online proﬁle with contact information and project details,
requesting access to multiple zone ﬁles becomes straightforward.
Registries still see multiple requests and can approve or deny them
individually, but the process is much simpler. Once the registry pro-
vides access, the user can download the zone ﬁle through a simple
API call up to once per day. Older TLDs can migrate to the new
system for zone access, but progress has been slow; so far, only
museum, coop, and xxx have migrated.
We have an account on CZDS, and manually refresh all new or
expired approval requests almost once per day.1 We have access to
the zone ﬁles for hundreds of domains, most using the new CZDS
system. We download a new snapshot of each daily, totaling 3.8
GB of gzipped text, more than half from com. For the analysis in
this paper we simplify the zones and store all NS, A, and AAAA
records on our HDFS cluster, and then store the raw zones on our
archive server for future use.
3.2
ICANN Public Data
ICANN also requires each registry to provide a handful of sum-
mary reports. We have used most of them at some point in our
methodology. The monthly transaction reports are particularly use-
ful for our study. ICANN requires each registry to publish monthly
summary statistics about the number of domains registered, trans-
ferred, expired, and renewed for each accredited registrar. We use
the monthly summary reports to identify the number of registered
domains that do not have any name server information and there-
fore do not appear in the zone ﬁle. We also use their breakdown of
domains per registrar when estimating registration costs.
We also relied upon ICANN’s New gTLD Current Application
Status listing [20]. We used the data provided to determine TLD
status and registry information as the new TLDs worked through
the application system.
3.3 Our TLD Set
We include results for new TLDs that started general availability
by the date of publication of ICANN’s latest monthly registry re-
ports on January 31, 2015, which altogether totals 502 new TLDs.
Table 1 breaks down these new TLDs into various high-level cate-
gories, together with the total number of new domains registered in
them at the time we crawled them.
