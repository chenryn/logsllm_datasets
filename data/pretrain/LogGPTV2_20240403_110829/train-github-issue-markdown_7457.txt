Currently, if you call the navigate function of the router within a component
constructor, 1 of 2 things happens. Either it changes the route just fine, or
it throws the following runtime error:
TypeError: Cannot read property 'constructor' of undefined
An error is ONLY thrown if the project includes a custom pipe. There may be
other circumstances which cause the runtime error to be thrown, but this is
definitely one of them. This can be very misleading that calling navigate
works fine, and then adding a custom pipe breaks this. This would lead
developers to think that they have created their pipe wrong, or that somehow a
custom pipe is breaking their system. Further complicating the matter is the
fact that the stack trace doesn't point at the call to router.navigate
