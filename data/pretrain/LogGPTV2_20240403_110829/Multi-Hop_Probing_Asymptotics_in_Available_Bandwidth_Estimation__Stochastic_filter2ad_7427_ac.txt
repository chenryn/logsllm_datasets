process {Di,δ(p, t)} and the available bandwidth process
{Bi,δ(p, t)}. This distributional stationarity allows us
to focus on the corresponding random variables Wi(p),
Di,δ(p), and Bi,δ(p). It is easy to get, from their deﬁni-
tions, that the statistical means of Di,δ(p) and Bi,δ(p) are
0 and Ci − xp, respectively6. Further, the ergodicity prop-
erty leads to the following result.
Lemma 1 For any ﬂow aggregation p that enter the path
at link Li, the random variable Bi,δ(p) converges in the
mean-square sense to Ci − xp as δ → ∞, i.e.,
E(cid:20)(cid:16)Bi,δ(p) − (Ci − xp)(cid:17)2(cid:21) = 0.
(20)
lim
δ→∞
On the other hand, notice that unlike {Yi,δ(p, t)} and
{Bi,δ(p, t)}, the workload-difference process {Di,δ(p, t)}
is not a moving average process by nature. Consequently,
the mean-square ergodicity of {Di,δ(p, t)} does not cause
the variance of Di,δ(p) to decay with respect to the in-
crease of δ. Instead, we have the following lemma.
Our next assumption states the independent relationship
between different ﬂows that enter path P at the same link.

δ→∞

Lemma 2 The variance of the random variable Di,δ(p)
converges to 2V ar[Wi(p)] as δ increases:
E(cid:20)(cid:16)Di,δ(p) − 0(cid:17)2(cid:21) = 2V ar [Wi(p)] .

To obtain our later results, not only do we need to know
the asymptotic variance of Yi,δ(p), Di,δ(p) and Bi,δ(p)
when δ approaches inﬁnity, but also we often rely on their
variance being uniformly bounded (for any δ) by some con-
stant. This condition can be easily justiﬁed from a prac-
tical standpoint. First note that cross-trafﬁc arrival rate
is bounded by the capacities of incoming links at a given
router. Suppose that the sum of all incoming link capaci-
ties at hop Li is C+, then Yi,δ(p) is distributed in a ﬁnite
interval [0, C+] and its variance is uniformly bounded by
+ for any observation interval δ. Similarly,
the constant C 2
the variance of Bi,δ(p) is uniformly bounded by the con-
i . The variance of Di,δ(p) is uniformly bounded by
stant C 2
the constant 4V ar[Wi(p)] for any δ, which directly follows
from the deﬁnition of Di,δ(p).
Finally, we remind that some of the notations introduced
in Section 2.1 now are used with a different meaning. The
rate of the bursty cross-trafﬁc ﬂow j, denoted by xj, is the
probabilistic mean of the trafﬁc intensity random variable
Yi,δ(fj), which is also the long-term average arrival rate of
ﬂow j at any link it traverses. The term λi = xri becomes
the long-term average arrival rate of the aggregated cross-
trafﬁc at link Li. The term Ai = Ci − λi is the long-
term average hop available bandwidth at link Li. Again
recall that we explicitly target the measurement of long-
term averages of available bandwidth and/or cross-trafﬁc
intensity, instead of the corresponding metrics in a certain
time interval.
3.2 Formulating Packet Train Probing
We now consider an inﬁnite series of packet-trains with in-
put inter-packet dispersion gI, packet size s, and packet-
train length n. This series is driven to path P by a point
process Λ(t) = max{m ≥ 0 : Tm ≤ t} with sufﬁcient
large inter-probing separation. Let d1(m, i) and dn(m, i)
be the departure time instances from link Li of the ﬁrst and
last probing packets in the mth packet-train. We deﬁne the
sampling interval of the packet-train as the total spacing
∆ = dn(m, i) − d1(m, i), and the output dispersion as the
average spacing G = ∆/(n − 1) of the packet-train. Both
∆ and G are random variables, whose statistics might de-
pend on several factors such as the input dispersion gI, the
packet-train parameters s and n, the packet-train index m
in the probing series, and the hop Li that the output disper-
sion G is associated with. Therefore, a full version of G is
written as Gi(gI , s, n, m). However, for notation brevity,
we often omit the parameters that have little relevance to
the topic under discussion.
We now formally state the questions we address in this
paper. Note that a realization of the stochastic process
{GN (gI , s, n, m), 1 ≤ m  γi−1
.
(26)
In what follows, we study the asymptotics of the curve
deviation βN when input packet-train parameters s or n
becomes large and show that the ﬂuid lower bound F is in
fact a tight bound of the real response curve Z.
4.2
Impact of Packet Train Parameters
We now demonstrate that for any input probing rate rI, the
curve deviation βN (s/rI , s, n) vanishes as probing packet
size s approaches inﬁnity. We prove this result under the
condition of one-hop persistent cross-trafﬁc routing. We
also justify this conclusion informally for arbitrary cross-
trafﬁc routing and point out the major difﬁculty in obtain-
ing a rigorous proof. First, we make an additional assump-
tion as follows.
Assumption 3 Denoting by Pi,δ(x) the distribution func-
tion of
the δ-interval available bandwidth process
{Bi,δ(ei, t)}, we assume that for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N, the fol-
lowing holds

Recall that the mean-square ergodicity assumption we
made earlier implies that as the observation interval δ gets
large, the random variable Bi,δ(ei) converges in distribu-
tion to Ci − xei. Assumption 3 further ensures that this
convergence is fast in the sense of (27). Even though this
Our next lemma shows that passing through a link can only
increase the dispersion random variable in mean.
Lemma 4 For 1 ≤ i ≤ N, the output dispersion random
variable Gi has a mean no less than that of Gi−1. That is,
E[Gi] ≥ E[Gi−1].
Using the ﬁrst part of (22), our next lemma shows that
for any link Li, the output dispersion random variable Gi
is lower bounded in mean by a linear combination of the
output dispersion random variables Gk, where k < i.
Lemma 5 For 1 ≤ i ≤ N, the output dispersion random
variable Gi satisﬁes the following inequality
E[Gi] ≥

This leads to the following theorem.

GN of path P is lower bounded in mean by the output dis-
persion γN (gI , s) of the ﬂuid counterpart of P:
E[GN (gI , s, n)] ≥ γN (gI , s).

condition appears cryptic at ﬁrst, it is valid in a broad range
of cross-trafﬁc environments. The next theorem shows the
validity of this assumption under the condition of regener-
ative9 link utilization.
Theorem 3 When hop utilization process {Ui(ei, t)} is re-
generative, condition (27) holds.
Note that regenerative queue is very common both in
practice and in stochastic modeling literature. In fact, all
the four trafﬁc types used in [9] lead to regenerative hop
workload and consequently lead to regenerative link uti-
lization. We also conjecture that (27) holds under a much
milder condition, but we leave its identiﬁcation as future
work.

the mean convergence of GN to γN can be obtained only
when the mean of GN −1 converges to γN −1 and when the

s → ∞.
We further point out that by assuming one-hop persis-
tent cross-trafﬁc routing, we have avoided analyzing the
departure processes of cross-trafﬁc ﬂows. When a travers-
ing ﬂow of link Li enters the path from some upstream link
of Li, the arrival process of the ﬂow at Li is its departure
process at Li−1. Unfortunately, in the queueing theory lit-
erature, there is no exact result for departure processes in
FCFS queueing models if one goes beyond the assumption
of Poisson arrivals. Motivated by the intractability of this
problem, researchers have focused their attentions on ap-
proximations [12], [15].
To accommodate arbitrary cross-trafﬁc routing patterns,
we also need an approximation assumption which says that
any cross-trafﬁc ﬂow that traverses link Li (regardless of
wether it enters the path from Li or some upstream link
of Li) exhibits ergodic stationary arrival at Li. Under this
assumption, which we call “stationary departure approx-
imation,” it becomes easy to extend Theorem 4 to cover
arbitrary cross-trafﬁc routing patterns. We skip the details
of this step and next apply the stationary departure approx-
imation to examine the impact of packet-train length n on
the response curve Z.
