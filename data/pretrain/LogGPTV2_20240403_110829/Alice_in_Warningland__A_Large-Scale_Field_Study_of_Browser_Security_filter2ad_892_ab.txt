12 websites as either phishing or legitimate sites, but the
EV certiﬁcates did not help subjects identify the phish-
ing sites [19]. In a follow-up study, Sobey et al. found
that none of their 28 subjects clicked on the EV indica-
tors, and the presence of EV indicators did not affect
decision-making [29]. Similarly, Biddle et al. found that
study participants did not understand Internet Explorer’s
certiﬁcate summaries [3].
In 2012, a Google Chrome engineer mentioned high
clickthrough rates for SSL warnings on his blog [20]. We
expand on this with a more accurate and detailed view of
SSL clickthrough rates in Google Chrome.
3.2 Phishing Warnings
Phishing warnings in contemporary browsers are active,
interstitial warnings; in the past, they have been passive
indicators in toolbars. Researchers have studied whether
they are effective at preventing people from entering their
credentials into phishing websites.
Wu et al. studied both interstitial and passive phish-
ing warnings [35]. Neither of the warnings that they
evaluated are currently in use in browsers. First, they
launched phishing attacks on 30 participants. The par-
ticipants role-played during the experiment while using
security toolbars that display passive phishing warnings.
Despite the toolbars, at least one attack fooled 20 out
of 30 participants. In their next experiment, they asked
10 study participants to perform tasks on PayPal and a
shopping wish list website; they injected modal phishing
warnings into the websites. None of the subjects entered
the credentials into the PayPal site, but the attack on the
wish list site fooled 4 subjects. The authors do not report
the warning clickthrough rates.
Egelman et al. subjected 60 people to simulated phish-
ing attacks in Internet Explorer 7 or Mozilla Firefox
2.0 [13]. Firefox 2.0 had a modal phishing dialog that is
not comparable to the current Mozilla Firefox phishing
dialog, and Internet Explorer had both passive and active
warnings. Participants believed that they were taking part
in a laboratory study about shopping. The researchers
asked participants to check their e-mail, which contained
both legitimate shopping conﬁrmation e-mails and similar
spear phishing e-mails sent by the researchers. Users who
clicked on the links in the phishing e-mails saw a phishing
warning. Participants who saw Mozilla Firefox’s active
warning, Internet Explorer’s active warning, or Internet
Explorer’s passive warning were phished 0%, 45%, and
90% of the time, respectively. The clickthrough rates
were an unspeciﬁed superset of the rates at which people
fell for the phishing attacks.

3.3 Malware Download Warnings
Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer also dis-
play non-blocking warning dialogs when users attempt
to download malicious executables. In a blog post, a Mi-
crosoft employee stated that the clickthrough rate for Inter-
net Explorer’s SmartScreen warning was under 5% [16].
We did not study this warning for Google Chrome, and
Mozilla Firefox does not have this warning.
4 Methodology
We rely on the telemetry features implemented in Mozilla
Firefox and Google Chrome to measure clickthrough rates
in situ. Telemetry is a mechanism for browser vendors to
collect pseudonymous data from end users who opt in to
statistics reporting. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox
use similar telemetry platforms.
4.1 Measuring Clickthrough Rates
We implemented metrics in both browsers to count the
number of times that a user sees, clicks through, or leaves
a malware, phishing, or SSL warning. Based on this data,
we can calculate clickthrough rates for each warning type.
As discussed in Section 2, we report only the clickthrough
rates for warnings that the user can bypass. We measured
the prevalence of non-bypassable warnings separately. To
supplement the clickthrough rates, we recorded whether
users clicked on links like “Help me understand,” “View,”
or “Technical Details.”
Bypassing some warnings takes multiple clicks, and
our clickthrough rates for these warnings represent the
number of users who completed all of the steps to proceed
to the page. For Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warning (which
takes three clicks to proceed), we recorded how often
users perform two intermediate clicks (on “Add Excep-
tion” or “Conﬁrm Security Exception”) as well as the
overall clickthrough rate.
We also measured how often users encounter and click
through speciﬁc SSL errors. In addition to the overall
clickthrough rates for the warnings, we collected click-
through data for each type of Mozilla Firefox SSL error
and the three most common Google Chrome SSL errors.
Our Mozilla Firefox data set does not allow us to track
speciﬁc telemetry participants. In Google Chrome, we
can correlate warning impressions with psuedonymous
browser client IDs; however, the sample size for most
individual users is too small to draw conclusions. We
therefore report the results of measurements aggregated
across all users unless otherwise speciﬁed. The telemetry
frameworks do not provide us with any personal or demo-
graphic information except for the operating system and
browser version for each warning impression.
4.2 Measuring Time Spent on Warnings
We also used the Google Chrome telemetry framework to
observe how much time Google Chrome users spent on
SSL warnings. Timing began as soon as an SSL warning
came to the foreground in a tab. In particular,
• We recorded the time spent on a warning and associ-
ated it with the outcome (click through or leave).
• We recorded the time spent on a warning and associ-
ated it with the error type, if it was one of the three
most common error types (untrusted authority, name
mismatch, and expired certiﬁcate).
Together, these correspond to ﬁve timing measurements
(two for outcome and three for error type). For scalability,
the telemetry mechanism in Google Chrome only allows
timing measurements in discrete buckets. As a result, our
analysis also treats time as a discrete, ordinal variable.
We used log-scaled bucket sizes (e.g., the ﬁrst bucket
size is 45ms but the last is 90,279ms) with 50 buckets,
ranging from 0ms to 1,200,000ms, for the two outcome
histograms. The three error type histograms had 75 buck-
ets each, ranging from 0ms to 900,000ms. We used more
buckets for the error histograms because we anticipated
that they would be more similar to each other.
4.3 Ethics
We collected data from users who participate in their
browsers’ broad, unpaid user metrics programs. At ﬁrst
run of a browser, the browser asks the user to share usage
data. If the user consents, the browser collects data on
performance, features, and stability. In some pre-release
developer channels, data collection is enabled by default.
The browser periodically sends this pseudonymous data
over SSL to the central Mozilla or Google servers for
analysis. The servers see the IP addresses of clients by
necessity, but they are not attached to telemetry data. All
telemetry data is subject to strict privacy policies and
participants can opt out by changing their settings [7, 23].
Multiple Google Chrome committers and Mozilla Firefox
contributors reviewed the data collection code to ensure
that the metrics did not collect any private data.
This work is not considered human subjects research by
UC Berkeley because the student did not have access to
database identiﬁers or personally identifying information.
4.4 Data Collection
Collection Period. Google Chrome’s malware and phish-
ing measurement code was in place in Chrome 24 prior
to our work, and our SSL measurement code was added
to Google Chrome 25. The Google Chrome data in this
262  22nd USENIX Security Symposium 
USENIX Association
paper was collected April 28 - May 31, 2013. Our Mozilla
Firefox measurement code was added to Firefox 17, and
a bug in the SSL measurement code was ﬁxed in Firefox
23. The data on the Firefox malware warning, phishing
warning, and SSL “Add Exception” dialog was collected
May 1-31, 2013. The data on Firefox SSL warnings was
collected June 1 - July 5, 2013, as the Firefox 23 ﬁx
progressed through the various release channels.
Sample Sizes. In Google Chrome, we recorded 6,040,082
malware warning impressions, 386,350 phishing warning
impressions, and 16,704,666 SSL warning impressions.
In Mozilla Firefox, we recorded 2,163,866 malware warn-
ing impressions, 100,004 phishing warning impressions,
and 10,976 SSL warning impressions. Appendix A fur-
ther breaks downs these sample sizes by OS and channel.
Number of Users. For Mozilla Firefox, we recorded
warning impressions from the approximately 1% of Fire-
fox users who opt in to share data with Mozilla via teleme-
try. In Google Chrome, we observed malware, phishing,
and SSL warning impressions on 2,148,026; 204,462; and
4,491,767 clients (i.e., browser installs), respectively.
4.5 Method Limitations
Private Data. Due to privacy constraints, we could not
collect information about users’ personal demographics
or browsing habits. Consequently, we cannot measure
whether user behavior differs based on personal character-
istics, the target site, or the source of the link to the site.
We also cannot identify SSL false positives due to captive
portals, network proxies, or server misconﬁgurations.
Sampling Bias. The participants in our ﬁeld study are not
a random population sample. Our study only represents
users who opt in to browser telemetry programs. This
might present a bias. The users who volunteered might be
more likely to click through dialogs and less concerned
about privacy. Thus, the clickthrough rates we measure
could be higher than population-wide rates. Given that
most of our observed rates are low, this bias augments our
claim that clickthrough rates are lower than anticipated.
Overrepresentation. We present clickthrough rates
across all warnings shown to all users. A subset of users
could potentially be overrepresented in our analysis.
Within the Google Chrome data set, we identiﬁed and
removed a small number of overrepresented clients who
we believe are either crawlers or malware researchers.
We were unable to remove individual clients from the
Mozilla Firefox set, but we do not believe this represents
a bias because we know that the overrepresented clients
in Chrome still contributed fewer than 1% of warning
impressions. Some clients experienced multiple types
of warning impressions; we investigated this in Chrome
and found that the clickthrough rates do not differ if
we remove non-independent clients. Our large sample
sizes and small critical value (α = 0.001) should further
ameliorate these concerns.
Frames. Our original measurement for Mozilla Firefox
did not differentiate between warnings shown in top-level
frames (i.e., warnings that ﬁll the whole tab) and warnings
shown in iframes. In contrast, Google Chrome always
shows malware and phishing warnings in the top-level
frame and does not render any warning type in iframes.
Since users might not notice warnings in iframes, the two
metrics are not necessarily directly comparable.
Upon discovering this issue, we modiﬁed our Firefox
measurement implementation to take frame level into
account. Our new implementation is not available to all
Firefox users yet, but we have data for recent pre-release
channels. For malware and phishing warning impressions
collected from the beta channel, the clickthrough rate for
the top-level frame is within two percentage points of
the overall clickthrough rate. This is due to the relative
infrequency of malware and phishing warnings in iframes
and the low overall clickthrough rate. Since the frame
level does not make a notable difference for malware and
phishing warnings, we present the overall rates (including
both top-level frames and iframes) for the full sample
sizes in Section 5.1. The difference is more important
for SSL warnings:
the clickthrough rate for top-level
frames is 28.7 percentage points higher than the overall
clickthrough rate of 4.3%. Consequently, Section 5.2
presents only the top-level frame rate for SSL warnings,
although it limits our sample to pre-release users.
5 Clickthrough Rates
We present the clickthrough data from our measurement
study. Section 5.1 discusses malware and phishing warn-
ings together because they share a visual appearance. We
then present rates for SSL warnings in Section 5.2.
5.1 Malware and Phishing Warnings
The clickthrough rates for malware warnings were 7.2%
and 23.2% in stable versions of Mozilla Firefox and
Google Chrome, respectively. For phishing warnings,
we found clickthrough rates of 9.1% and 18.0%. In this
section, we discuss the effects of warning type, demo-
graphics, and browser on the clickthrough rates.
5.1.1 Malware Rates by Date
The malware warning clickthrough rates for Google
Chrome vary widely by date. We have observed click-
through rates ranging from 11.2% to 24.9%, depending

on the week, since the current version of the warning
was released in August 2012. In contrast, the Mozilla
Firefox malware warning clickthrough rate across weeks
stays within one percentage point of the month-long
average. We did not observe similar temporal variations
for phishing or SSL warnings.
Recall from Section 2.1 that Google Chrome and
Mozilla Firefox’s malware warnings differ with respect
to secondary resources: Google Chrome shows an
interstitial malware warning if a website includes
secondary resources from a domain on the Safe Browsing
list, whereas Mozilla Firefox silently blocks the resource.
We believe that this makes Google Chrome’s malware
clickthrough rates more sensitive to the contents of the
Safe Browsing list. For example, consider the case where
a well-known website accidentally loads an advertisement
from a malicious domain. Google Chrome would show
a warning, which users might not believe because they
trust the website. Mozilla Firefox users would not see
any warning. Furthermore, Chrome phishing warnings
are less likely to be due to secondary resources, and that
warning’s clickthrough rates do not vary much by time.
5.1.2 Malware/Phishing Rates by Warning Type
In Mozilla Firefox, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly higher click-
through rate for phishing warnings than malware warn-
ings (χ2 test: p(1) < 0.0001). This behavior is rational:
a malware website can infect the user’s computer without
any action on the user’s part, but a phishing website can
only cause harm by tricking the user at a later point in
time. Mozilla Firefox makes this priority ordering explicit
by choosing to display the malware warning if a website
is listed as both malware and phishing.3 However, the
practical difference is small: 7.2% vs. 9.1%.
In Google Chrome, the average malware clickthrough
rate is higher than the phishing clickthrough rate. How-
ever, the malware clickthrough rate ﬂuctuates widely (Sec-
tion 5.1.1); the malware clickthrough rate is sometimes
lower than the phishing clickthrough rate.
5.1.3 Malware/Phishing Rates by Demographics
We consider whether users of different operating systems
and browser release channels react differently to warn-
ings. As Table 1 depicts, Linux users have signiﬁcantly
higher clickthrough rates than Mac and Windows users
