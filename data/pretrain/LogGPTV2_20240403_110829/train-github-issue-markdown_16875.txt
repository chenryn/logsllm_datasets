Following a discussion with @NelleV I suggest to decrease the number of CI
builds to help easing the backlog.
  * drop USE_PYTEST (now useless)
On Travis, e.g.:
  * py2.7 mock numpy=1.7 pandas docs
  * py3.4
  * py3.6 pandas docs pep8 delete-font-cache
  * osx (=2.7) mock
Note that we really should build the docs on 2.7 too (extra points if we build
them on OSX instead of the Linux 2.7 job) -- right now they don't build on 2.7
at all (due to failure in examples).
On Appveyor the third job is currently a duplicate of the second(!) except
that one has USE_PYTEST and not the other (which is the same). So we could be
left with
  * py2.7 numpy=1.8 without extra dependencies
  * py3.5 numpy=1.10 without extra dependencies
  * py2.7 numpy=1.10 _32-bit_ with extra dependencies  
(the last two could be merged into e.g. py3.5 numpy=1.10 32-bit with extra
dependencies, if we're still under backlog pressure)
More extra points if someone manages to build the docs on Windows...
