User: On the Linux system, how to safely allocate, manage and limit the resource usage of each process?
Assistant: 1. Use user and group management In the Linux system, user and group management can be used to control the resource usage of each process. You can create different users and groups, assign each process to different users and groups, and set corresponding permissions and restrictions, so as to ensure that each process can only use its allocated resources. 2. Using cgroup to manage cgroup is a resource management mechanism provided by the Linux kernel, which can be used to manage the resource usage of each process. Using cgroup can limit and control CPU, memory, disk, network and other resources, so as to effectively protect the security and stability of the system. 3. Use limitation tools There are also some tools specially used to limit the resource usage of each process in the Linux system, such as ulimit, cpulimit, etc. These tools can be used to set the CPU usage, memory usage, number of open files, etc. of the process, so as to effectively protect the security and stability of the system. 4. Using container technology Container technology can isolate various processes in different virtual environments so that they do not interfere with each other. Container technology can be used to manage and limit the resources of each virtual environment, so as to effectively protect the security and stability of the system.
