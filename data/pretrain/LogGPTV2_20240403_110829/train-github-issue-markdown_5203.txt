### Expected Behavior
    const filter = {
         urls: [
              "file://*.sobot.com/*"
         ]
    }
    browserWindow.webContents.session.webRequest.onBeforeRequest(filter,  (details, callback) => {
                const { id, url, method, resourceType, timestamp, uploadData } = details;
                // url === "file://users/liutong/Desktop/**/projectName/app/***"
               callback({
                    cancel: false,
                    redirectURL: 'http' + url.slice(4)
                })
            })
The callback of `onBeforeRequest` will be called by any request from the file
scheme.
### Actual Behavior
For the above codes, I just want to redirect a request that contains the
'*.sobot.com' domain,  
But I received a URL from the local path of `/users/Oliver/Desktop` in the
callback of `onBeforeRequest`.
When I add "file://*.sobot.com/*" a rule in the array, for the rule, I
actually expected it only to match request that domain is '.sobot.com', but It
appears to listen to all requests. e.g
    [ "file://users/Oliver/Desktop/**/projectName/app/caching_resources/***" ]
### To Reproduce
### Screenshots
### Additional Information
As for my final purpose, you can refer to this issue. so my fallback is to
exclude any request that contains a path of 'caching_resources' as to redirect
to the `HTTP` scheme.
