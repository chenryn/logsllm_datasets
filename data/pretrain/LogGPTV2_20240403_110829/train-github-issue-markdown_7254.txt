Google App Engine is used by a lot of developers. I use the python environment
myself. It's sandboxed and can't rely on any non-Python code. It also has
other restrictions (for example, you need to use this patched version of
urllib3 urllib3/urllib3#61.)
I can successfully
> > > import requests
but then
> > > response = requests.get('someurl')
fails with the following traceback. Does anyone know what's going on?
