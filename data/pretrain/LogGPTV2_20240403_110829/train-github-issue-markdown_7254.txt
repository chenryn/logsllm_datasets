**Issue with Using the `requests` Library in Google App Engine**

Google App Engine (GAE) is a popular platform used by many developers, and I personally work with the Python environment. GAE operates within a sandboxed environment, which means it cannot rely on any non-Python code. Additionally, there are other restrictions; for example, you need to use a patched version of `urllib3` (see [this issue](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/61)).

I can successfully import the `requests` library:

```python
import requests
```

However, when I attempt to make a GET request, it fails with the following traceback. Can anyone provide insight into what might be causing this?

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):

    userhome = pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid()).pw_dir
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'getuid'
```

This error suggests that the `os` module does not have the `getuid` attribute, which is typically available in standard Python environments but may be restricted or missing in the GAE sandbox. Any suggestions on how to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated.
