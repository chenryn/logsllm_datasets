evaluation.
5. OTHER OBSERVATIONS
Given no knowledge about a /24 block, which address
is most likely to be responsive?2 This question has some
bearing on which representative we should select for gone-
dark blocks, or for newly-allocated blocks with no census
data yet.
Discussions with network operators suggest some network
practices are common. Often addresses are allocated sequen-
tially from the start of an block, and network managers often
use the ﬁrst or last address in a block for the routers. Since
address blocks are allocated on powers-of-two according to
CIDR [16], we expect to see uneven use of the address space.
Recent work has conﬁrmed visibility of allocation blocks in
census data [5], but not last-octet usage.
To evaluate this question, Figure 7 shows the distribution
of responsiveness for the last octet for all in it29w.
(We
got similar results on it28w and it30w censuses.) Consistent
with expectation, the most responsive octet is .1, responding
0.86% of the time, more than twice as often as the median
responsiveness (0.38%), and 1.5× more frequent than .129
(0.55%), the next most responsive last octet.
Figure 7 shows a pattern in responsiveness, with responses
being most frequent at addresses that are one greater than
2We thank Kim Claﬀy for suggesting the question of last
octet distribution for study.

a power of two. The top ten are ranked .1, .129, .65, .33,
.2, .254, .17, .193, .97, .9, and of these only 2 and 254 do
not follow this pattern. To show this trend more clearly,
Figure 8 shows the rank of each last octet as the area of a
circle, with the octets arranged in a sequential grid (so the x
axis lists octets sequentially in groups of 16, while each step
up the y axis is 16 more than the previous). The vertical
lines correspond to more frequent responses, with x = 1
showing strong response from .1, .129, .65, etc., and x = 9
for .9, etc. The other prominent features are .254 and across
y = 0 (.1, .2, .3, etc.). While showing ranks exaggerate what
can be small absolute diﬀerences, these strong patterns show
power-of-two allocations aﬀect responsiveness.
6. SHARING HITLISTS
Our goal in generating hitlists is to share them with other
research groups carrying out topology studies. We oﬀer
them free-of-charge to all, and to date we have provided
them to four other projects. Although hitlists are not hu-
man subjects, networks are operated by and involve humans.
Hitlist use by multiple prompts us to consider their distribu-
tion in the context of the Belmont protocols [28], weighing
the beneﬁts and potential costs of sharing and designing
policies accordingly.
The beneﬁts of sharing hitlists are similar to sharing of
other research results. Shared data is a boon to researchers.
421A common data source can lower the barrier to entry for
future research, and it also makes it easier for researchers
to compare their results. (For example, the TREC bench-
marks are seen as essential to rapid advances in the ﬁeld of
Information Retrieval [13], although our eﬀorts are far more
modest.) As importantly, we expect that the scrutiny of
multiple researchers on a common dataset can often identify
data or methodological errors that might be otherwise unno-
ticed. (In Internet topology, the problem of alias resolution
is one that is still being reﬁned [2, 21], nearly ten years after
the ﬁrst techniques [17].) For the hitlist creator, a shared
result amortizes the operational costs of collection and pro-
cessing of the input data (Internet censuses) needed to create
hitlists. Finally, for the hitlist subjects, network operators
in the Internet, a common source allows us to centralize “do-
not-probe” blacklists and reduces raw data collection.
Shared hitlists have some costs, however. Most serious is
that a hitlist can focus the probing of several researchers on
a speciﬁc representative address in a network, while indepen-
dently derived hitlists are more likely to distribute probing
load. Second, eventually hitlists will be acquired by ma-
licious users on the Internet. Potential harms are hiding
malicious traﬃc mixed with research traﬃc, and the slight
risk that any list of known active IP addresses may be at risk
of additional malicious traﬃc such as worms or cracking at-
tempts. While a risk, the eﬀort to generate a hitlist is within
the reach of a motivated individual, so strong restrictions on
hitlists seem unwarranted.
Our current hitlist distribution policies are designed to
balance risks with beneﬁts. Although we share hitlists free-
of-charge, we provide them subject to a usage agreement.
Hitlist users may not redistribute hitlists so we can establish
this agreement directly with all users. Tracking hitlist users
allows us to estimate load on representatives. We also plan
to seed the hitlist with representatives that we monitor to
track load. We also hope controlled hitlist distribution
delays their acquisition by malicious parties. We expect to
review these policies as we gain more experience.
7. FUTURE WORK
Although we are providing our current hitlists for use cur-
rently, we see two directions for future work.
First, we would like to better understand the stability of
Internet address usage. Our study shows only 50–60% of in-
formed representatives respond three months later, implying
a great deal of churn on Internet address usage. We would
like to better understand why usage of the remaining ad-
dresses cannot be better predicted. More detailed analysis
of gone-dark and unstable blocks may provide more informa-
tion; and a combination of our data with information IANA
assignments, RIR registration and block reassignment may
explain causes for failure to respond. Alternatively, changes
in ﬁrewalling may explain address instability.
Second, we expect to get more information about how
hitlists are used. Several groups expressed concern that rep-
resentatives may become overloaded as multiple groups tar-
get them with measurement traﬃc. We are in the process
of seed our hitlist with monitors so we can observe hitlist
use and compare it to normal “background radiation”. Such
an evaluation will help understand hitlist use and charac-
terize general unsolicited Internet traﬃc. If representative
load becomes high, it will suggest operational changes, such
as multiple representatives per /24 block.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have deﬁned the properties that are important to
hitlists: representatives that are responsive, stable, and pro-
vide complete coverage for the Internet. We have developed
a fully automated algorithm that mines data from Internet
censuses to select informed representatives for the visible In-
ternet. We employ information that is available for about
one-third of the Internet, and when an informed represen-
tative is available we see it is 50–60% likely to respond 2–
3 months later. We showed that the primary reasons for
prediction failure are blocks with dynamic addressing and
gone-dark blocks that are probable ﬁrewalls.
Our hitlists are available free-of-charge and have already
been distributed to four diﬀerent research groups. Although
we do not have external evaluation of how their use changes
those studies, our evaluation of one prior study suggests the
potential to discover 1.7 million additional edge links.
