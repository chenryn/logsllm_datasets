When attempting to call `require('node-expat')`, I encounter the following error: "Error: A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed."

### Environment Details:
- **Operating Systems**: Tested on Windows 8.1, both 64-bit and 32-bit (using a virtual machine).
- **Software Versions**:
  - Visual Studio Code: 0.10.5
  - Node.js: 4.1.1 (ia64 and x86) and 5.3.0 (ia64 and x86)
  - Python: 2.7.11
  - node-expat: 2.3.9
  - Visual Studio: 2013 Ultimate (on ia64) and 2015 Community (on x86)

### Steps Taken:
- On my 64-bit machine, I tried installing both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of Node.js and Python.
- For the 32-bit environment, I set up a fresh virtual machine and installed the following:
  - Visual Studio Code: 0.10.5
  - Node.js: 5.3.0 (32-bit)
  - Python: 2.7.11
  - Visual Studio: 2015 Community

I then created a "Hello World" example using `yo`, added `node-expat` version 2.3.9 to the project dependencies, and included the following line in the extension initialization code:
```javascript
var x = require('node-expat');
```
Upon activating the extension, I received the aforementioned error.

### Questions:
- Does Visual Studio Code support extensions with binary dependencies?
- Should this behavior be documented?

### Additional Information:
This issue appears to be a duplicate of bug #658.
