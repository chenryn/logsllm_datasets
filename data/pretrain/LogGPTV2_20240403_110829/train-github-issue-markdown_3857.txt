Calling "require('node-expat')" results in "Error: A dynamic link library
(DLL) initialization routine failed"
Platforms: tested with Windows 8.1 64 and x86 (virtual machine)  
Versions: VSCode 0.10.5, Node.js 4.1.1 ia64 or x86; or Node.js 5.3.0 ia64 or
x86, Python 2.7.11, node-expat 2.3.9, Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate (on ia64) or
2015 Community (on x86)
On my ia64 machine, I have attempted installing both ia64 and x86 versions of
Node.js and Python.
For x86, I performed a clean test on a fresh VM: installed VSCode 0.10.5,
Node.js 5.3.0 x86, Python 2.7.11, and VS 2015 Community. Then I created the
"Hello World" example (via yo), added "node-expat": "2.3.9" to the project
dependencies, and then added "var x = require ('node-expat') to the extension
initialization routine. When the extension activates, I get the above error.
... does VSCode support extensions with binary dependencies? Should this be
documented?
EDIT: this appears to be a duplicate of bug #658
