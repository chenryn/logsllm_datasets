Figure 8: Delivery probability over time (in seconds)
for four 11 Mbit/s links, all with about 50% aver-
age loss rate. The send rate is about 600 1500-byte
packets/second. Each point is an average over 200
milliseconds. The top graph shows one of Roofnet’s
most bursty links, the bottom one of the least
bursty.
Figure 7 shows delivery probability over time for four
Roofnet links running at 1 Mbit/s with 1500-byte packets.
The lines indicate averages over successive 200-millisecond
intervals. The four links are chosen from among the set of
links with delivery probabilities near 50%: the top graph
shows the link from that set with the highest short-term
variation in delivery probability, the bottom graph shows
the link with the lowest variation, and the other two show
representative links with intermediate amounts of variation.
Figure 8 shows similar data for 11 Mbit/s. These graphs
suggest that there is considerable diﬀerence from link to link
in the burstyness of the delivery probability.
Figures 7 and 8 show how delivery probability changes at
a time scale of 200 milliseconds, but it would also be useful
to know how much ﬂuctuation there is over other intervals.
Such an analysis would reveal any characteristic burst size
of packet losses. One way to summarize changes at diﬀerent
time scales is to plot the Allan deviation [2] at each time
scale. Allan deviation diﬀers from standard deviation in that
it uses the diﬀerences between successive samples, rather
than the diﬀerence between each sample and the long-term
mean. In this case, the samples are the fraction of packets
delivered in successive intervals of a particular length. The
Allan deviation is appropriate for data sets in which the
data has persistent ﬂuctuations away from the mean. The
formula for the Allan deviation of a sequence of samples xi
is:

Figure 9: Allan deviations of loss rate for various
time intervals, for the four 1 Mbit/s links in Fig-
ure 7. 1, 2, 3, and 4 refer to the graphs in Figure 7
from top to bottom. The bold line is what you would
see if losses were independent. The lines begin at the
time for a single packet transmission, as this is the
smallest value for which the Allan deviation can be
computed.
the characteristic burst length. At smaller intervals, adja-
cent samples will change slowly, and the Allan deviation will
be low. At longer intervals, each sample will tend towards
the long-term average, and the Allan deviation will also be
small.
Figures 9 and 10 show the Allan deviations of loss rate at
various intervals for 1 and 11 Mbit/s. The bold line shows
the deviation for a synthetic link with independent packet
loss: the deviation starts at a maximum when the interval
is equal to the 1500-byte packet transmission time, then de-
creases because averaging over longer time intervals rapidly
smoothes out ﬂuctuations. The data from Roofnet also start
at a peak at one packet time, but they decrease less quickly
than the synthetic independent data; this suggests that ac-
tual loss is bursty on some links.
For both 1 and 11 Mbit/s, the Allan deviation shows that
loss behaves as if it were independent for time intervals less
than about 0.1 seconds. For longer intervals, some of the
links show bursty losses, and some do not. The bursty links
all show correlation out to at least 1 second.
To illustrate what fraction of links exhibit these bursty
loss patterns, Figure 11 shows the Allan deviation of loss
rate for all links, for one-second intervals. The graph shows
that most links vary in loss rate by only a few percent from
one second to the next, but that there are a small minority
of links that vary by 10% or more. That is, the relatively
smooth bottom graphs in Figures 7 and 8 are the most com-
mon types.
The predominance of non-bursty links suggests that most
of the links with intermediate loss rates in Figure 4 have
more or less independent packet loss. That is, the links
are not really alternating between “up” and “down.” One
consequence of this is that, for most links, measuring a link’s
loss rate over intervals as short as a few seconds will provide

were independent.
an average useful in predicting the near-term future. On the
other hand, a signiﬁcant minority of links (at the right in
Figure 11) varies substantially in loss rate from one second
to the next.
6. Effect of Signal-to-Noise Ratio
One reason that many links in Figure 4 have intermediate
loss rates might be that many links have marginal signal-to-
noise ratios. The Prism 2.5 speciﬁcation [1] suggests that the
range of S/N values for which the packet error rate would be
between 10% and 90% is only 3 dB wide, assuming additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
Figure 12 shows the results of an emulator experiment in
which the sender is essentially connected to the receiver with
a cable and a variable attenuator. The x-axis shows the S/N
reported by the receiver’s card at each level of attenuation,
and the y-axis shows the delivery probability. This exper-
iment conﬁrms the manufacturer’s speciﬁcation: most S/N
values result in either very high or very low loss rates; the
intermediate range is only a few dB wide.
In order for marginal S/N with AWGN to explain why so
many Roofnet links have intermediate loss rates, the major-
ity of Roofnet links would have to have S/N ratios in a nar-
row 3 dB range. Figure 13 shows that is not the case. The
range of S/N values is much greater than 3 dB, even though
most Roofnet links have intermediate loss rates. Figure 14
shows scatter plots of each Roofnet link’s average delivery
probability and average S/N. While high S/N values corre-
spond to high delivery probabilities, the range of S/N values
for intermediate loss rates is much wider than 3 dB.
It is possible that variations in receive sensitivity across
the nodes could be responsible for the spread of S/N values
in Figure 14, but that individual nodes might have the ex-
pected relationship between S/N and delivery probability.
Figure 15 shows per-receiver versions of the 1 Mbit/s plot
from Figure 14. These plots show a better correlation be-
tween S/N and delivery probability. However, the range of
S/N values corresponding to intermediate loss rates is still

Allan Deviation of Loss Rate

much larger than 3 dB for three of the four receivers, sug-
gesting that S/N is not the only factor determining delivery
probability.
Figure 16 shows the eﬀect on delivery probability of vary-
ing the transmit power level, and thus the received signal
strength. The data come from an experiment in which
each sender transmitted at three diﬀerent power levels. The
three curves show the delivery probabilities between the
node pairs at 10, 40, and 200 milliwatts. The power levels
were veriﬁed by cabling an 802.11 card directly to a spec-
trum analyzer.
Figure 16 is not entirely inconsistent with simple models:
assuming that signal strength falls oﬀ with the cube of dis-
tance, quadrupling the power should increase the radius of
any given signal level by 1.6, and the area covered by 2.6.
This is somewhat higher than the increase in the number
of nodes covered when increasing the power from 10 to 40
milliwatts.
A practical conclusion from the data in this section is that
although S/N does aﬀect delivery probability, one cannot
expect to use S/N as a predictive tool.
7. Effect of Transmit Bit-Rate
Figure 4 implies that the 802.11b transmit bit-rates diﬀer
in robustness; for example, there are about three times as
many links at 1 Mbit/s as at 11. This section explores the
eﬀect of transmit bit-rate on losses, and particularly on net
throughput, in more detail.
Figure 17 shows, for each pair of nodes, the throughput
in 1500-byte packets/second at the diﬀerent bit-rates. The
pairs are sorted by the throughput at 11 Mbit/s. The graph
is truncated so that it is missing the low-quality pairs.
Figure 17 has a number of implications for 802.11b bit-
rate selection algorithms. First, an algorithm should wait
until a high bit-rate is performing very badly (i.e. deliv-
ering only half the packets) before it reduces the bit-rate.
Second, 11 Mbit/s often provides higher throughput than
5.5 Mbit/s even when the loss rate at 11 Mbit/s is higher
than 50%. Third, performance at a low bit-rate is not a
good predictor of performance at higher rates:
