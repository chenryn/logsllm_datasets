### Delivery Probability and Link Characteristics

#### Figures 7 and 8: Delivery Probability Over Time
**Figure 7** illustrates the delivery probability over time for four 1 Mbit/s links, each with an average loss rate of approximately 50%. The send rate is about 80 packets per second, with each packet being 1500 bytes. Each data point represents an average over 200 milliseconds. The top graph depicts one of the most bursty links in the Roofnet network, while the bottom graph shows one of the least bursty.

**Figure 8** presents similar data for four 11 Mbit/s links, also with an average loss rate of about 50%. The send rate here is about 600 packets per second, with each packet being 1500 bytes. The top graph again shows the most bursty link, and the bottom graph shows the least bursty.

These figures highlight the significant differences in burstiness across different links, even when they have similar average loss rates.

#### Allan Deviation Analysis
To further analyze the variability in delivery probability over different time intervals, we use the Allan deviation. This metric is particularly useful for datasets with persistent fluctuations away from the mean. The formula for the Allan deviation of a sequence of samples \( x_i \) is:

\[
\text{Allan deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=2}^{n} (x_i - x_{i-1})^2}
\]

**Figure 9** and **Figure 10** show the Allan deviations of the loss rate for various time intervals for the 1 Mbit/s and 11 Mbit/s links, respectively. The bold line in these figures represents the deviation for a synthetic link with independent packet loss. The data from the actual Roofnet links start at a peak at one packet time and decrease less quickly than the synthetic data, indicating that some links exhibit bursty losses.

For both 1 Mbit/s and 11 Mbit/s, the Allan deviation suggests that loss behaves as if it were independent for time intervals less than about 0.1 seconds. For longer intervals, some links show bursty losses, while others do not. The bursty links show correlation out to at least 1 second.

**Figure 11** illustrates the Allan deviation of the loss rate for all links over one-second intervals. Most links vary in loss rate by only a few percent from one second to the next, but a small minority vary by 10% or more. This indicates that the relatively smooth bottom graphs in Figures 7 and 8 are the most common types.

#### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N)
One possible reason for the intermediate loss rates in many links could be marginal signal-to-noise ratios. According to the Prism 2.5 specification, the range of S/N values for which the packet error rate would be between 10% and 90% is only 3 dB wide, assuming additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

**Figure 12** confirms this specification through an emulator experiment, showing that most S/N values result in either very high or very low loss rates, with the intermediate range being only a few dB wide.

However, **Figure 13** and **Figure 14** indicate that the range of S/N values in the Roofnet network is much greater than 3 dB, even though most links have intermediate loss rates. This suggests that S/N alone cannot explain the intermediate loss rates.

**Figure 15** shows per-receiver versions of the 1 Mbit/s plot from Figure 14, revealing a better correlation between S/N and delivery probability. However, the range of S/N values corresponding to intermediate loss rates is still much larger than 3 dB for three of the four receivers, indicating that other factors also influence delivery probability.

**Figure 16** demonstrates the effect of varying the transmit power level on delivery probability. The data come from an experiment where each sender transmitted at three different power levels (10, 40, and 200 milliwatts). The results suggest that although S/N affects delivery probability, it cannot be used as a reliable predictive tool.

#### Effect of Transmit Bit-Rate
**Figure 4** implies that the 802.11b transmit bit-rates differ in robustness. For example, there are about three times as many links at 1 Mbit/s as at 11 Mbit/s. This section explores the effect of transmit bit-rate on losses and net throughput in more detail.

**Figure 17** shows the throughput in 1500-byte packets/second for each pair of nodes at different bit-rates. The pairs are sorted by the throughput at 11 Mbit/s, and the graph is truncated to exclude low-quality pairs. This figure has several implications for 802.11b bit-rate selection algorithms:
1. An algorithm should wait until a high bit-rate is performing very badly (delivering only half the packets) before reducing the bit-rate.
2. 11 Mbit/s often provides higher throughput than 5.5 Mbit/s, even when the loss rate at 11 Mbit/s is higher than 50%.
3. Performance at a low bit-rate is not a good predictor of performance at higher rates.

In conclusion, the analysis of delivery probability, Allan deviation, S/N, and transmit bit-rate provides valuable insights into the behavior of wireless links in the Roofnet network. These findings can inform the design and optimization of wireless communication systems.
