**ATT&CK ID:** T1596.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** DNS/Passive DNS

Adversaries may exploit DNS (Domain Name System) and passive DNS data to gather information about potential targets. This information can be used for various malicious purposes, such as reconnaissance and planning future attacks. DNS records provide a wealth of details, including:

- **Registered Name Servers:** Identifying the authoritative name servers for a domain.
- **Subdomain Addressing:** Revealing the IP addresses and other relevant information associated with subdomains.
- **Mail Server Records:** Providing details about the mail servers (MX records) used by the target.
- **Other Hosts:** Listing additional hosts and their corresponding IP addresses within the target's domain.

By analyzing this data, adversaries can gain valuable insights into the target's network infrastructure, which can be leveraged to identify potential vulnerabilities or to craft more effective phishing campaigns.
