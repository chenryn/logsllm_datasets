Worm Scans per Second (log)
(f) PGD
Fig. 4. F- against local-preference worm: percent of experiments where the worm
was not detected (lower is better performance) with a local-preference scanning worm
protected network and that fewer connections per time period are visible to a
gateway-based detector. However, the scan is still random in nature, so shares
the same general characteristics as the purely random scanning worm.
Figure 4 shows that for most scenarios, the detectors show a slight decrease
in sensitivity. This is visible as a shift to the right in the false negative curves.
The TRW detector was able to detect 100% of the random worms in the wireless
environment at 0.05 scans per second, but is only able to detect 100% of the local-
preference worms at 0.1 scans per second. TRWRBS, RBS, MRW, and DSC all
show similar decreases in performance in some environments. The reason for
this is simply the reduction of worm scans that are visible to the detector. The
limit of a detector’s ability to spot the worm—meaning the slowest worm that
it can detect reliably—is at the point where it can just barely observe enough
evidence to infer that a host is infected. If a worm scans more slowly or not all
its scans cross the gateway (as in local-preference worms), the evidence visible
to the detector may not be enough to make the determination that a worm is
present.
The one detector that shows a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent response is the PGD
detector, showing better performance against the local-preference worm than it
did against the random worm. The PGD detector measures the protocol graph
of all hosts in the network, and the more infected hosts there are, the more
scanning there will be using the protocol the worm targets. This leads to either
more total nodes in the graph or a larger connected component, allowing the
PGD detector to spot the local-preference worm in situations where it would
not have detected a random scanning worm.
The latency results are also impacted by the local-preference scanning strategy
(Figure 5). The TRWRBS, RBS, DSC, and MRW detectors show worse detec-
tion latency in all environments for the local-preference worm as compared to
