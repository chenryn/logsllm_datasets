User: What do you use to automatically deploy applications for various kinds of server applications (web, socket, daemon) that uses various technologies (different DBs, languages, etc)? 
Here we use Python, Java and Ruby, and may use other languages as well in the future.
Update: I ended up using Puppet to manage all server setup, configs AND deploy. To trigger the deploy of newer versions I ended up using Python Fabric scripts.
Assistant: We use Maven and pull out to the ant-plugin when required.  In turn the ant-plugin very occasionally calls out to some native scripting language/application/packager/whatever but we're finding that over time we can generally find a Maven or ANT plugin/task to do the trick.
You might want to look up Continuous Deployment, it's a pretty hot topic in the  build and CI space right now.
