#### Abstract
Cyberspace represents a new domain of warfare. Computers and the information they contain are valuable assets in any military conflict. However, the intangible nature of cyberspace complicates the assessment of victory, defeat, and battle damage. Military leaders today seek to understand and manage this new threat to national security. Sun Tzu's *Art of War* is one of the most influential military treatises in history, offering flexible recommendations that have been adapted to various circumstances over 2,500 years. This article explores whether *Art of War* can be applied to cyber warfare. It concludes that while Sun Tzu provides a useful framework, it is not perfect, and modern military strategists must consider the unique aspects of the cyber battlefield.

#### What is Cyber Warfare?
The Internet, in a technical sense, is a vast network of interconnected computers. Humans have become increasingly dependent on "cyberspace," the continuous flow of information and ideas from the Internet that they integrate into their daily lives. As this dependence grows, the potential "attack surface" for hackers expands. National security and international conflict management are no exception; political and military adversaries now routinely use and abuse computers to achieve strategic and tactical objectives. In the early 1980s, Soviet thinkers referred to this as the Military Technological Revolution (MTR). After the 1991 Gulf War, the Pentagon's Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) became a widely recognized concept (Mishra, 2003).

Cyber attacks exploit several key features of the Internet:
1. **Power and Reach:** Since the early days of the Web, Chechen rebels have demonstrated the power of Internet-enabled propaganda (Goble, 1999).
2. **Vulnerability:** In 2007, Syrian air defense was reportedly disabled by a cyber attack just before the Israeli Air Force destroyed an alleged Syrian nuclear reactor (Fulghum et al., 2007).
3. **Anonymity:** During the 1999 Kosovo war, unknown hackers attempted to disrupt NATO military operations, achieving minor successes (Geers, 2008).
4. **Nation-State Targets:** In 2009, Kyrgyzstan was knocked offline during a political crisis (Keizer, 2009).

Other characteristics of cyber attacks include high return on investment, plausible deniability, the immaturity of cyber defense, and the increased importance of non-state actors in the Internet era.

Cyber attacks serve a variety of purposes, including espionage, financial damage, and manipulation of critical infrastructures. They can influence conflicts between governments, citizens, and civil society.

#### Sun Tzu's *Art of War*
Modern military doctrine draws from a rich philosophical tradition spanning political, economic, and scientific revolutions. One of the oldest and most profound treatises is Sun Tzu's *Art of War* (孙子兵法). Many current military concepts, such as grand strategy, center of gravity, decisive point, and commander's intent, can be traced back to this book (Van Riper, 2006).

According to Chinese tradition, *Art of War* was written by Sun Wu (now Tzu) in the 6th century B.C. and is one of China's Seven Military Classics. Some scholars argue that the text may have multiple authors, but its internal consistency suggests it is the product of a single school of military thought. Translated into Western languages in 1782, *Art of War* may have influenced Napoleon's battlefield victories (Sawyer, 1994).

*Art of War* has endured for 2,500 years because its advice is compelling, concise, easy to understand, and adaptable. Sun Tzu does not provide a concrete plan of action but offers recommendations that can be tailored to new circumstances. His concepts have been successfully applied to fields beyond warfare, including sports, social relationships, and business (Sawyer, 1994).

The book consists of thirteen chapters, each focusing on a specific aspect of warfare. This paper highlights relevant passages from each chapter and argues that while Sun Tzu provides a workable framework for managing cyber war, it is not perfect.

#### Strategic Thinking
*Art of War* begins with a warning: 
> "The Art of War is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected." (Sun Tzu, *Art of War*: I. Laying Plans)

At the strategic level, a leader must take steps to prevent political coercion and surprise military attacks. *Art of War* states that offensive operations are justified only in response to a direct threat to the nation, not for economic reasons (Sawyer, 1994).

Cyberspace is a new arena of conflict, and basic defense and attack strategies are still unclear. There have been no major wars yet between modern, cyber-capable adversaries. Cyber warfare tactics are highly technical, often accessible only to experts. Hackers have found success through media hype, and the challenge of retaliation against asymmetric threats is significant. Attack attribution is particularly vexing; if attackers remain anonymous, defense strategies are compromised from the start. The sensitive nature of cyber warfare capabilities and methods has also inhibited international discussion and increased the guesswork required by national security planners.

The grace period for uncertainty may be ending. Modern militaries, like the governments and economies they protect, are increasingly reliant on IT infrastructure. In 2010, the U.S. Air Force will procure more unmanned than manned aircraft for the first time (Orton, 2009). Increased IT investment means greater mission dependence on IT systems, making them attractive targets for adversaries. Future ground fighting is likely to be accompanied by a parallel, largely invisible battle over IT infrastructure.

Exercises like the U.S. Department of Defense's Eligible Receiver in 1997 suggest that cyber attacks can be powerful weapons. During the exercise, simulated North Korean hackers used various tactics, including the transmission of fabricated military orders and news reports, to create mistrust within the command-and-control system (Adams, 2001).

Nations weak in conventional military power are likely to invest in cyber warfare to offset disadvantages. Good hacker software is easier to obtain than traditional military equipment. Intelligence officials, such as former CIA Director James Woolsey, warn that even terrorist groups will possess cyber weapons of strategic significance in the coming years (Aitoro, 2009).

While some analysts argue that the threat from cyber warfare is overstated, national security planners cannot afford to underestimate its potential. A general rule could be that as dependence on IT and the Internet grows, governments should make proportional investments in network security, incident response, technical training, and international collaboration.

In the near term, international security dialogue must update familiar vocabulary such as attack, defense, deterrence, and escalation to encompass post-IT Revolution realities. The process that began nearly thirty years ago with MTR and RMA continues with initiatives like NATO's Network Enabled Capability (NNEC), China's Unrestricted Warfare, and the creation of U.S. Cyber Command. However, the word "cyber" still does not appear in NATO's current Strategic Concept (1999), indicating much work remains. The rapid evolution of IT technology makes it challenging to keep up with, let alone master, all the latest developments.

From a historical perspective, it is tempting to think that cyber warfare could have a positive impact on human conflict. Sun Tzu advised military commanders to avoid unnecessary destruction of adversary infrastructure:
> "In the practical Art of War, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them." (Sun Tzu, *Art of War*: III. Attack by Stratagem)

If cyber attacks play a lead role in future wars, and the fight is largely over IT infrastructure, it is conceivable that international conflicts will be shorter and cost fewer lives. A cyber-only victory could facilitate economic recovery and post-war diplomacy, aligning with Sun Tzu's principle that the best leaders can attain victory without combat (Sawyer, 1994):
> "Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting." (Sun Tzu, *Art of War*: III. Attack by Stratagem)

However, there is no guarantee that increased use of cyber warfare will reduce human suffering. If critical infrastructures like water or electricity are damaged, the cause of the outage will make little difference to those affected. Military leaders are concerned that cyber attacks could have unforeseen "cascading" effects, leading to civilian casualties and violations of the Geneva Convention (Graham, 1999). The anonymous nature of cyber attacks also raises the disturbing possibility of unknown hackers targeting critical infrastructures during peacetime for purely terrorist purposes.

#### Cultivating Success
Due to the remarkable achievements of cyber crime and cyber espionage, as well as media hype, military commanders view cyber warfare as both a threat and an opportunity. *Art of War* emphasizes the importance of building a solid defense, which is where a cyber commander must begin:
> "The Art of War teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable." (Sun Tzu, *Art of War*: VIII. Variation in Tactics)

Sun Tzu advises commanders not to rely on the good intentions of others or best-case scenarios (Sawyer, 1994). In cyberspace, this is sound advice: computers are attacked from the moment they connect to the Internet (Skoudis, 2006). Cyber attackers currently have numerous advantages, including worldwide connectivity, vulnerable network infrastructure, poor attacker attribution, and the ability to choose their time and place of attack.

Defenders, however, have resources at their disposal. They own the home-field advantage, a powerful asset, and must use it wisely. Defenders have indigenous "super-user" rights throughout the network and can change hardware and software configurations at will. They can build redundancy into their operations and implement out-of-band cross-checking of important information. Such tactics are essential because cyber attack methods evolve rapidly, and static, predictable defenses are destined to fail. A primary goal should be to create a unique environment that is resilient and adaptive.
