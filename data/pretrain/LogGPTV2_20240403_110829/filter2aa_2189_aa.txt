Abstract 
Cyberspace is a new warfare domain. Computers and the in-
formation they contain are prizes to be won during any military 
conflict. But the intangible nature of cyberspace can make vic-
tory, defeat, and battle damage difficult to calculate. Military 
leaders today are looking for a way to understand and manage 
this new threat to national security. The most influential mili-
tary treatise in history is Sun Tzu‟s Art of War: its recommen-
dations are flexible and have been adapted to new circumstanc-
es for over 2,500 years. This article examines whether Art of 
War is flexible enough to encompass cyber warfare. It con-
cludes that Sun Tzu provides a useful but far from perfect 
framework for the management of cyber war, and urges modern 
military strategists to consider the distinctive aspects of the 
cyber battlefield. 
What is Cyber Warfare? 
The Internet, in a technical sense, is merely a large collection of networked 
computers. Humans, however, have grown dependent on „cyberspace‟: the 
flow of information and ideas that they receive from the Internet on a continu-
al basis, and immediately incorporate into their lives. As our dependence upon 
the Internet grows, what hackers think of as their potential „attack surface‟ 
expands. The governance of national security and international conflict is no 
different: political and military adversaries now routinely use and abuse com-
puters in support of strategic and tactical objectives. In the early 1980s, Soviet 
thinkers referred to this as the Military Technological Revolution (MTR); fol-

lowing the 1991 Gulf War, the Pentagon‟s Revolution in Mil-
itary Affairs (RMA) was practically a household term (Mish-
ra, 2003). 
Cyber attacks first and foremost exploit the power and 
reach of the Internet: since the earliest days of the Web, 
Chechen rebels have demonstrated the power of Internet-
enabled propaganda (Goble, 1999). Second, they exploit its 
vulnerability: in 2007, Syrian air defense was reportedly 
disabled by a cyber attack moments before the Israeli air 
force demolished an alleged Syrian nuclear reactor (Fulghum 
et al, 2007). Third, cyber attackers benefit from a degree of 
anonymity: during the 1999 war over Kosovo, unknown 
hackers tried to disrupt NATO military operations, and were 
able to claim minor victories (Geers, 2008). Fourth, even a 
nation-state can be targeted: in 2009, the whole of 
Kyrgyzstan was knocked offline during a time of political crisis (Keizer, 
2009). This list could be lengthened to include cyber warfare‟s high return on 
investment, an attacker‟s plausible deniability, the immaturity of cyber defense 
as a discipline, the increased importance of non-state actors in the Internet era, 
and more. 
Cyber attacks are best understood as an extraordinary means to a wide 
variety of ends: espionage, financial damage, and even the manipulation of 
national critical infrastructures. They can influence the course of conflict 
between governments, between citizens, and between government and civil 
society.

What is Art of War? 
Modern military doctrine draws from a deep well of philosophy that spans 
political, economic, and scientific revolutions. The oldest and most profound 
treatise is Sun Tzu‟s Military Strategy, known as Art of War (孙子兵法). 
Much of our current understanding of military concepts such as grand strategy, 
center of gravity, decisive point, and commander‟s intent can be traced to this 
book (Van Riper, 2006). 
According to Chinese tradition, Art of War was written by Sun Wu 
(now Tzu) in the 6th century B.C., and is one of China‟s Seven Military Clas-
sics. Some scholars argue that gaps in logic and anachronisms in the text point 
to multiple authors and they contend that Art of War is a compilation of differ-
ent texts that were brought together over time. Nonetheless, the book has an 
internal consistency which implies it is the product of one school of military 
thought. Art of War was translated for the West by a French missionary in 
1782, and may have had an influence on the battlefield victories of Napoleon, 
who was likely familiar with its contents (Sawyer, 1994). 
Art of War has survived for 2,500 years because its advice is not only 
compelling, but concise, easy to understand, and flexible. Sun Tzu does not 
give military leaders a concrete plan of action, but a series of recommenda-
tions that can be adapted to new circumstances. Sun Tzu‟s concepts have been 
successfully applied to disciplines other than warfare, including sports, social 
relationships, and business (Sawyer, 1994). 
There are thirteen chapters in Art of War; each is dedicated to a particu-
lar facet of warfare. This paper highlights at least one topical passage from 
each chapter, and will argue that Sun Tzu provides a workable but not a per-
fect framework for the management of cyber war.

Strategic Thinking 
Art of War opens with a warning: 
The Art of War is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter 
of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a 
subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected. AoW: 
I. Laying Plans1 
At the strategic level, a leader must take the steps necessary to prevent politi-
cal coercion by a foreign power and to prevent a surprise military attack. Re-
garding offensive military operations, Art of War states that they are justified 
only in response to a direct threat to the nation; economic considerations, for 
example, are insufficient (Sawyer, 1994). 
Cyberspace is such a new arena of conflict that basic defense and at-
tack strategies are still unclear. There have been no major wars (yet) between 
modern, cyber-capable adversaries. Further, cyber warfare tactics are highly 
technical by nature, often accessible only to subject matter experts. As with 
terrorism, hackers have found success in pure media hype. As with Weapons 
of Mass Destruction (WMD), it is challenging to retaliate against an asymmet-
ric threat. Attack attribution is the most vexing question of all: if the attacker 
can remain anonymous, defense strategies appear doomed from the start. Fi-
nally, the sensitive nature of cyber warfare capabilities and methods has inhib-
ited international discussion on the subject and greatly increased the amount of 
guesswork required by national security planners. 
The grace period for uncertainty may be running out. Modern militaries, 
like the governments and economies they protect, are increasingly reliant on 
IT infrastructure. In 2010, the United States Air Force will procure more un-
manned than manned aircraft for the first time (Orton, 2009). IT investment on

this scale necessarily means an increased mission dependence on IT. As ad-
versaries look for their opponent‟s Achilles Heel, IT systems will be attractive 
targets. It is likely that the ground-fighting of future wars will be accompanied 
by a parallel, mostly invisible battle of wits between state-sponsored hackers 
over the IT infrastructure that is required to wage war at all. 
Celebrated Red Team exercises, such as the U.S. Department of De-
fense‟s Eligible Receiver in 1997, suggest that cyber attacks are potentially 
powerful weapons. During the exercise, simulated North Korean hackers, us-
ing a variety of hacker and information warfare tactics including the transmis-
sion of fabricated military orders and news reports, “managed to infect the 
human command-and-control system with a paralyzing level of mistrust … as 
a result, nobody in the chain of command, from the president on down, could 
believe anything” (Adams, 2001). 
Because cyber warfare is unconventional and asymmetric warfare, na-
tions weak in conventional military power are also likely to invest in it as a 
way to offset conventional disadvantages. Good hacker software is easier to 
obtain than a tank or a rifle. Intelligence officials such as former CIA Director 
James Woolsey warn that even terrorist groups will possess cyber weapons of 
strategic significance in the next few years (Aitoro, 2009). 
Some analysts argue persuasively that the threat from cyber warfare is 
overstated.2 However, national security planners cannot afford to underesti-
mate its potential. A general rule could be that as dependence on IT and the 
Internet grows, governments should make proportional investments in network 
security, incident response, technical training, and international collaboration. 
In the near term, international security dialogue must update familiar 
vocabulary such as attack, defense, deterrence and escalation to encompass 
post-IT Revolution realities. The process that began nearly thirty years ago 
with MTR and RMA continues with the NATO Network Enabled Capability

(NNEC), China‟s Unrestricted Warfare, and the creation of U.S. Cyber Com-
mand. However, the word cyber still does not appear in NATO‟s current Stra-
tegic Concept (1999), so there remains much work to do. A major challenge 
with IT technology is that it changes so quickly it is difficult to follow – let 
alone master – all of the latest developments. 
From a historical perspective, it is tempting to think cyber warfare 
could have a positive impact on human conflict. For example, Sun Tzu ad-
vised military commanders to avoid unnecessary destruction of adversary in-
frastructure.  
In the practical Art of War, the best thing of all is to take the 
enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is 
not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire 
than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a 
company entire than to destroy them. AoW: III. Attack by 
Stratagem 
If cyber attacks play a lead role in future wars, and the nature of the 
fight is largely over IT infrastructure, it is conceivable that international con-
flicts will be shorter and cost fewer lives. A cyber-only victory could facilitate 
economic recovery and post-war diplomacy. Such an achievement would 
please Sun Tzu, who argued that the best leaders can attain victory before 
combat is even necessary (Sawyer, 1994). 
Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme 
excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the ene-
my‟s resistance without fighting. AoW: III. Attack by Strata-

But there is no guarantee that the increased use of cyber warfare will 
lead to less human suffering during international conflicts. If national critical 
infrastructures such as water or electricity are damaged for any period of time, 
what caused the outage will make little difference to those affected. Military 
leaders are specifically worried that cyber attacks could have unforeseen „cas-
cading‟ effects that would inadvertently lead to civilian casualties, violate the 
Geneva Convention and bring war crimes charges (Graham, 1999). The anon-
ymous nature of cyber attacks also leads to the disturbing possibility of un-
known and therefore undeterred hackers targeting critical infrastructures dur-
ing a time of peace for purely terrorist purposes. 
Cultivating Success 
Due to the remarkable achievements of cyber crime and cyber espionage3 – as 
well as plenty of media hype – cyber warfare will be viewed by military com-
manders as both a threat and an opportunity. But the most eloquent passages 
from Art of War relate to building a solid defense, and this is where a cyber 
commander must begin. 
The Art of War teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the 
enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; 
not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact 
that we have made our position unassailable. AoW: VIII. Var-
iation in Tactics 
Sun Tzu advises commanders not to rely on the good intentions of oth-
ers, or to count on best-case scenarios (Sawyer, 1994). In cyberspace, this is 
sound advice: computers are attacked from the moment they connect to the 
Internet (Skoudis, 2006). Cyber attackers currently have numerous advantages

over defenders, including worldwide connectivity, vulnerable network infra-
structure, poor attacker attribution, and the ability to choose their time and 
place of attack. 
Defenders are not without resources. They own what should be the 
most powerful asset in the battle – home-field advantage – and they must 
begin to use it more wisely. Defenders have indigenous „super-user‟ rights 
throughout the network, and they can change hardware and software configu-
rations at will. They can build redundancy into their operations and implement 
out-of-band cross-checking of important information. Such tactics are essential 
because cyber attack methods evolve so quickly that static, predictable defens-
es are doomed to fail. A primary goal should be to create a unique environ-
