User: How to use Python to monitor and alarm the CPU and memory utilization of the server?
Assistant: To monitor and alarm the CPU and memory utilization of the server, you can use Python and related libraries. Here are some basic steps: 1. Install the required libraries. CPU and memory usage can be obtained using the psutil library. The smtplib and email libraries can be used to send alarm emails. 2. Write a Python script to monitor CPU and memory usage. CPU utilization and memory usage can be obtained using the cpu_percent() and virtual_memory() functions in the psutil library. 3. Set the threshold and judge whether the threshold is exceeded. Set the warning value in the script, and use the if statement to determine whether the current CPU utilization and memory usage exceed the set threshold. 4. Send an alarm email. If the threshold is exceeded, use the smtplib and email library to send an email to remind the administrator to deal with it. The following is a sample code that monitors CPU and memory usage and sends an alert email when the threshold is exceeded: ```python import psutil import smtplib from email.mime.text import MIMEText #set threshold cpu_threshold = 80 mem_threshold = 80 # Get CPU utilization and memory usage cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1) mem_usage = psutil.virtual_memory().percent # Determine whether the threshold is exceeded if cpu_usage > cpu_threshold or mem_usage > mem_threshold: # Send email sender = 'your_email@example.com' receiver = 'admin@example.com' subject = 'Server Alert' msg = f'CPU usage: {cpu_usage}%\nMemory usage: {mem_usage}%' message = MIMEText(msg) message ['From'] = sender message['To'] = receiver message['Subject'] = subject smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP('localhost') smtpObj.sendmail(sender, receiver, message.as_string()) smtpObj.quit () ```
