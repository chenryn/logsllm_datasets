Abstract
The GPS has empowered billions of users and various critical
infrastructures with its positioning and time services. How-
ever, GPS spooﬁng attacks also become a growing threat to
GPS-dependent systems. Existing detection methods either
require expensive hardware modiﬁcations to current GPS de-
vices or lack the basic robustness against sophisticated attacks,
hurting their adoption and usage in practice.
In this paper, we propose a novel GPS spooﬁng detection
framework that works with off-the-shelf GPS chipsets. Our
basic idea is to rotate a one-side-blocked GPS receiver to
derive the angle-of-arrival (AoAs) of received signals and
compare them with the GPS constellation (consists of tens of
GPS satellites). We ﬁrst demonstrate the effectiveness of this
idea by implementing a smartphone prototype and evaluat-
ing it against a real spoofer in various ﬁeld experiments (in
both open air and urban canyon environments). Our method
achieves a high accuracy (95%–100%) in 5 seconds. Then
we implement an adaptive attack, assuming the attacker be-
comes aware of our defense method and actively modulates
the spooﬁng signals accordingly. We study this adaptive at-
tack and propose enhancement methods (using the rotation
speed as the “secret key”) to fortify the defense. Further ex-
periments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the
enhanced defense.

Introduction
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based
system that provides geolocation and time information to
GPS receivers anywhere on or near the Earth [5]. In addition
to military usage, GPS also supports a wide range of civilian
applications that require positioning services such as vehicle
navigation, drone/boat operation, cargo tracking, and farm
automation. Critical infrastructures such as cellular networks,

ﬁnancial systems, and power grids also rely on civilian GPS’s
time service to obtain globally synchronized time information.
Unfortunately, civilian GPS is known to be vulnerable to
spooﬁng attacks [50, 53]. Adversaries can generate and trans-
mit falsiﬁed GPS signals to take control of the victim’s GPS
device, producing the wrong location and time information
to affect the dependent systems. Existing works have demon-
strated GPS spooﬁng attacks in various applications, includ-
ing diverting a luxury yacht from Monaco to Greece [1, 6],
attacking the road navigation system [31, 56], and manipulat-
ing sensor-fusion algorithms on self-driving cars [44].
In recent years, there is a growing concern about GPS
spooﬁng threat, considering the increasing number of de-
vices (e.g., IoT devices, robots, autonomous vehicles) that
are equipped with GPS sensors. Meanwhile, the software
and hardware tools needed to launch the attack are becoming
increasingly accessible. For example, software-deﬁned radio
platforms [10] have signiﬁcantly reduced the cost of gener-
ating GPS signals. Recent studies show that a portable and
programmable spoofer only costs about $200 [26, 56].
GPS Spooﬁng Defense.
To address the threat of GPS
spooﬁng, various solutions are proposed. Unfortunately, few
are adopted in practice. Existing techniques either require
signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to the current GPS devices or need
specialized hardware (i.e., high deployment cost), or are not
robust against sophisticated attackers. For example, one solu-
tion is to introduce encryption and authentication mechanisms
to civilian GPS [16, 42]. However, the estimated cost can be
multi-billion dollars given the need to modify the satellites
and existing GPS receivers. Alternatively, researchers have
proposed to collect advanced measurement data about GPS
signals to detect anomalies [25, 39, 40]. Due to the need for
special hardware (e.g., antenna-array), these methods can only
be realized on software-deﬁned radio platforms or a limited
set of GPS receivers equipped with enhanced chipsets.
To reduce the cost, other software-based methods aim
to detect sudden changes of the GPS signals [14]. How-
ever, recent works show that advanced attackers can use a

“smooth-takeover” method to avoid sudden signal changes
during spooﬁng [14, 56]. Researchers also propose to cross-
check GPS signals with other information sources such as
WiFi/Cellular access points, and other Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS) such as Galileo and GLONASS [13].
The problem is these alternative information channels can also
be manipulated [47], and the ground infrastructures such as
cellular towers are not dense enough for cross-validation.
Our Proposal.
In this paper, we investigate new anti-
spooﬁng techniques aiming to achieve both high robustness
and low cost. We propose software-based methods to de-
tect spooﬁng attacks that work for off-the-shelf GPS chipsets.
The key idea is to measure and analyze GPS signals to de-
rive the angle-of-arrival (AoA), based on the intuitions that
attackers cannot (easily) emulate the physical angle-of-arrival
of GPS signals from tens of GPS satellites around Earth si-
multaneously. Unlike traditional methods to derive AoA
(which require expensive hardware such as large antenna-
arrays [8,25,40]), our idea is to place a signal-blocking shield
on one side of the GPS receiver while rotating the GPS re-
ceiver with the shield. Experimentally, we show that the
physical rotation could simulate the effect of a directional
antenna to estimate AoA for spooﬁng detection.
Based on these ideas, we ﬁrst design defense methods by
deriving and analyzing the AoAs across different GPS satel-
lites. These methods are experimentally validated to be effec-
tive against basic attackers who are not aware of the presence
of the defense. To explore to what extend the adaptive attack-
ers can mimic the legitimate GPS signals when they are aware
of our defenses, we further implemented an adaptive attack.
We ﬁnd that adaptive attackers can modulate the spooﬁng
signals to eliminate many of the AoA artifacts. However, this
adaptation is highly dependent on key information about the
victim GPS device such as the rotation speed and the facing
angle. Based on this observation, we then develop advanced
defense methods by using the rotation speed and the facing
angle as the “secret key”. Fundamentally, the defender has
full control of the rotation speed and can even change it in
real-time. This makes the defense more robust because (1)
the attacker has low visibility of the receiver’s precise rota-
tion speed and real-time facing angle, and (2) it is extremely
difﬁcult to adapt the spooﬁng modulation in real-time.
Implementation and Evaluation. We implemented our
defense methods in a smartphone app. For the evaluation,
we also built a programmable GPS spoofer using software-
deﬁned radios which supported both the basic attack and the
adaptive attack. We performed real-world experiments with
the spoofer and the prototype mobile app while complying
with ethical and legal guidelines (see Section 6.2). We tested
human body and metal sheet as the signal blocking materials
(for different deployment scenarios), and conﬁrmed that both
materials are effective. Our experiments showed that the
defense methods could detect the basic spooﬁng attacks with
100% accuracy within 5 seconds in “open air” and 20 seconds
in “urban canyon”, respectively. Against adaptive attackers,
our advanced methods also demonstrated effectiveness (with
slightly longer detection time) with detection accuracy of 95%
in “open air” and 80% in “urban canyon”.
Contributions: We make the following contributions:
• First, we proposed a new method for GPS spooﬁng de-
tection that works on off-the-shelf GPS chipsets. The
method leverages the idea of rotation and partial block-
age to emulate the function of a directional antenna to
facilitate spooﬁng detection.
• Second, we explored both basic attacks and adaptive
attacks (i.e., adversaries are aware of our defense), and
introduced additional measures to fortify the defense.
• Third, we implemented proposed methods (as a mobile
app) and the adaptive attacks (using software-deﬁned
radios). Field experiments were conducted under various
conditions to validate the effectiveness of our defenses.
To facilitate future research, we release code of our defense
prototypes and analytical tools 1.
2 Background and Related Work
2.1 GPS Spooﬁng Attack
GPS is one of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS). Today’s GPS contains 31 satellites in medium
Earth orbit, each equipped with a synchronized atomic clock.
The satellites continuously broadcast GPS information using
Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) code on the L1 band at 1575.42
MHz and encrypted precision (P/Y) code on the L2 band at
1227.60 MHz with 50 bps data rate. The GPS receiver can
use the received information to calculate its own longitude,
latitude, and altitude. Note that only authorized U.S. military
receivers can use the P(Y) code. Civilian receivers can only
get access to C/A code which is not encrypted.
Civilian GPS equipment is known to be vulnerable to spoof-
ing attacks [24, 53]. In a spooﬁng attack, the attacker ﬁrst
lures the victim GPS receiver to migrate from the legitimate
signal to the spooﬁng signal. This takeover phase can be
either “brute-forced” or “smooth”. In a brute-force attack,
the false signals are transmitted at high power, causing the
victim to lose track of the satellites and locking onto the
stronger spooﬁng signals during the signal reacquisition pro-
cess. Brute-force takeover is easy to implement but will cause
abnormal jumps in the received signal strength or the com-
puted clocks.
In comparison, a smooth takeover is more
stealthy. It begins by transmitting signals synchronized with
the legitimate signals and then gradually overpowering the

legitimate signals to cause the migration. Smooth takeover re-
quires specialized hardware to perform real-time tracking and
synchronization with the legitimate signals, which is more
costly [18, 33]. Once the receiver locks on the spooﬁng sig-
nal, the attacker can manipulate the GPS receiver by either
shifting the signals’ arrival time or modifying the navigation
messages [33, 34, 37].
Existing works have demonstrated GPS spooﬁng attacks
in various applications. Examples include diverting a lux-
ury yacht from Monaco to Greece [1, 6], misleading road
navigation systems [31, 56], and manipulating sensor-fusion
algorithms on self-driving cars [44]. In addition to location
spooﬁng, the timing service provided by GPS is also vulnera-
ble. For instance, in 2012, a single GPS spoofer manipulated
timestamps of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) in power
grids [45]. In 2008, the London Stock Exchange lost 10 min
of timing information due to a GPS jamming attack [53].
2.2 Existing Anti-spooﬁng Methods
We use Figure 1 to discuss existing GPS anti-spooﬁng meth-
ods from two dimensions: the cost of modifying existing
software and hardware stacks in GPS equipment, and the
robustness in detecting attacks.
Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring.
Receiver
Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is designed for
integrity checks on GPS signals. It handles non-adversarial
errors caused by natural signal propagation disturbance such
as ionospheric dispersion. However, RAIM cannot detect
advanced GPS attacks (e.g., smooth takeover attacks) [37].
Checking Additional Info Sources.
Researchers have
proposed to cross-check GPS readings with additional in-
formation sources including Inertial Measurement Units
(IMUs) [9, 17, 48] and Inertial Navigation System (INS) [49].
However, IMU and INS systems suffer from signiﬁcant drift
and deviation errors [7,54] and hence are ineffective in detect-
ing spooﬁng attacks that gradually deviate from true locations.
Other works propose to check external information of-
fered by wireless infrastructures such as Network Time Pro-
tocol [12], Precision Time Protocol, WiFi, Cellular, Blue-
tooth, Bands of GPS L2 or L1 P(Y) [35], and other GNSS
systems (Galileo, Beidou, GLONASS) [13]. However, not
all the chipsets on commodity devices (e.g., smartphones)
can receive multi-source information. Also, advanced ad-
versaries can still launch attacks on these wireless channels
to alter the location/timing information or simply jam chan-
nels [45–47]. For instance, for cross-constellation comparison
based methods, multi-frequency, multi-constellation spoofers
can overcome their defenses. Such spoofers can be realized
in low-cost SDR [13] and are also commercialized [3]. Fi-
nally, many of these methods also require a dense deployment
of the wireless infrastructures on the ground, which limits
their coverage and usability in practice (e.g., in rural areas).
Recent works propose specialized defenses for aircraft (or a
group of coordinated aerial vehicles) by cross-checking the
satellite imagery [55] or checking with other peers in the
group [21, 22]. These methods are specialized for (and thus
limited to) aircraft and/or multi-receivers.
Signal-processing-based Defenses.
This line of defense
aims to extract features from real and spoofed signals to detect
spooﬁng. For example, one direction is to detect overpow-
ered spooﬁng signals by examining Automatic Gain Con-
trol (AGC) and Carrier-to-Noise-Density (CN0) measure-
ments [28, 41]. The Auxiliary peak tracking method tracks
all GPS signals in the environment to detect incoherence be-
tween spoofed and legitimate signals [39]. The ﬁngerprinting
method [11] detects ﬁngerprint differences between legitimate
signals and spooﬁng signals.
While these approaches only need a single antenna, they
must access low-level hardware information that is not tra-
ditionally accessible through software in GPS receivers. As
such, these methods can only be realized on software-deﬁned
radio platforms or a limited set of GPS receivers equipped
with enhanced GNSS chipsets (i.e., not widely deployable).
AoA-based Defenses.
Angle of Arrival (AoA) based de-
fenses leverage multi-receiver or specialized antennas (e.g.,
arrays, dual-polarization) to estimate the direction of GPS
signals. These methods detect spooﬁng attacks by identify-
ing abnormal AoA estimations [8, 25, 29, 40] or abnormal
carrier phase changes during motion [38]. AoA is recog-
nized as a robust defense method [30], but the high costs of
specialized hardware become the barrier to their adoption in
practice. For example, specialized lab-built antennas (such
as GALANT [27] and Stanford PCB Dual Polarization An-
tenna [19,25]) are not readily available. Similarly, the method
