As far as I can tell, the static `getInitialProps` doesn't provide a uniform
way to access url params on the client and server. On the server, you can
access `req` and parse the url yourself. On the client, we don't seem to have
access to the route information within the `getInitialProps` function. The
uses for this are fairly obvious, i think, such as loading a particular user
profile based on an `:id` param, and so on. I'm also wondering if auth could
somehow be implemented here too -- thought I'm less clear if that's the best
API.
