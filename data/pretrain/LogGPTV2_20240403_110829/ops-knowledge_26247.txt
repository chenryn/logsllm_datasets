Question: An Android application is using AES encryption with CBC block mode for data security. Considering the security benefits and the support provided by AndroidKeyStore, which of the following statements is an accurate counterargument to the use of CBC over GCM?
"A": "GCM should be preferred over CBC because GCM does not require separate authentication, whereas CBC does.",
"B": "CBC is more secure than GCM because it has been around longer and is better understood.",
"C": "CBC is preferable as it supports padding, which is not supported by GCM when used with AndroidKeyStore.",
"D": "GCM is not supported by AndroidKeyStore and therefore CBC remains the only viable block mode for AES encryption."
Answer: A
