not scheduled. Second, when a user is scheduled, his
CQI-to-throughput ratio is the maximum among all user.
Thus its value of CQIi(t)/Ri(t − 1) is approximately
c(t). Equation 7 summarizes our analysis:

c(t+1) =
c(t)/(1 + σ · (c(t) − 1)) not scheduled

where  and σ are functions of α. We used  and σ
instead of α to compensate for the possible errors in
our estimation of the maximum CQI-to-throughput ra-
tio, and determined them empirically.

3.4.1 Attack results
Figure 4(a) shows the number of time slots obtained
using our prediction strategy in simulation. When there
is a single attacker per cell of 50 users, the attackers
(one in each cell) may obtain between 11583 (64%) and
15874 (88%) time slots, depending on the scheme for as-
signing initial average throughput. When there are ﬁve
attackers per cell, they can obtain between 14353 (79%)

and 17136 (95%) time slots. Next, we compare the ef-
fect of the attack under this realistic situation where at-
tackers do not know the CQIs of the victims to the the
ideal situation discussed in Section 3.3. Figure 4(b)
shows the fraction of time slots that the attackers ob-
tain when they do not know the CQIs of the victim users
compared to the case where they know the CQIs. In all
cases, the attackers could still obtain more than 85% of
the time slots that they would obtain in the ideal situa-
tion. In particular, if the PF scheduler uses user-provided
initial average throughput, the attackers can obtain al-
most the same number of time slots as in the ideal situa-
tion.
As an illustration, we show the impact of the attack

cently started offering it. VoIP packets have a rigorous
delay requirement: 0-0.15s delay is acceptable, 0.15s-
0.40s delay might be tolerable, but longer delay is dis-
ruptive [20]. This delay budget is end-to-end, including
the uplink delay from the sender (U), the transmission
delay over the Internet (T , at least 0.1s across the con-
tinental USA), the downlink delay to the user (D), and
other processing delay for VoIP (O, about 0.101s) [16].
One attacker can cause 0.81s downlink delay for vic-
tim users; therefore, the end-to-end VoIP application de-
lay of all (victim) users in the attacker’s cell is at least
T + D + O = 0.10+0.81+0.10 = 1.01s. If ﬁve attack-
ers collude, the average downlink delay for a victim user
increases to 1.80s, thus the end-to-end delay on users’
VoIP applications is 0.10 + 1.80 + 0.10 = 2.01s. Such
excessive delay would make VoIP services useless. To
illustrate, consider that geostationary satellite latency is
between 240-280ms. Above illustrated attacks can elicit
delays that are about 4-8 times longer.
Number of handoffs per user
In a normal operation,
users do not perform very frequent handoffs. On the
other hand, attackers performs handoffs as frequently as
one every 5 time slots, or one every 7.5-10ms. The base
station can observe and record the number of handoffs
performed per user over a period of time. If a user per-
forms an unusually high number of handoffs in a given
time, the base station can reject further handoff requests,
thereby stopping the attack in that cell.
Number of retransmissions per user Due to mobil-
ity, it is normal for users to experience retransmissions.
However, as attackers are overestimating their channel
conditions while staying close to cell boundaries, the
base station can detect an attack in progress if it observes
that the number of continuous retransmissions per user
(due to HARQ mechanism) is above a certain threshold
value. False alarms may occur if the user is in an unfa-
vorable condition, such as moving away from the BS or
with a highly-variable channel condition.
4 Possible defense strategies
4.2 Attack prevention
The above-illuminated attack exploits several vulner-
abilities that combined enable malicious users to per-
form a denial-of-service attack on downlink cellular data
service. To defend against these types of attacks, we
outline some defense strategies that either eliminate rel-
evant vulnerabilities or mitigate their impact. The fol-
lowing defense strategies could be implemented in cur-
rent as well as future cellular systems.
4.1 Attack detection
There are three parameters that the base station can
monitor in order to distinguish normal from under-attack
operation; namely, decrease of average user throughput,
exorbitant number of handoffs and excessive retransmis-
sions. We can take advantage of these features in com-
posing a defense strategy.
Anomaly detection using average throughput The
base station can measure an average user’s throughput
during normal operation, either by simulation or by ac-
tual measurement. Then, it can compare the current
throughput with recorded normal throughput.
If their
difference is above a certain threshold, this could indi-
cate that the system is under attack. At this point, the
base station can use several methods to mitigate the at-
tack, including temporarily reverting to a scheduler that
does not require user collaboration, such as round robin,
while tracing the attack source.
In this section, we ﬁrst consider a set of variations of
the PF scheduler and evaluate their effect on attack pre-
vention. We then propose a new handoff scheme to be
combined with a scheduler that can largely mitigate the
effects of the attacks while considering network perfor-
mance.
4.2.1 Variations of PF scheduler
We have discussed the PF scheduler so far. There are,
however, various implementations of the PF scheduler,
which we refered to as hybrid PF scheduler. While these
modiﬁcations are proposed primarily for Quality of Ser-
vice (QoS) purposes, we discuss their resilience against
attacks from a security viewpoint.
Priority queue The base station can utilize priority
queues to alleviate the impact of attacks outlined in
the previous section. In particular, the base station can
schedule trafﬁc with delay constraints, such as VoIP traf-
ﬁc, with high priority, while other trafﬁc, such as web
browsing, can be scheduled with low priority. Because
the number of high priority users is relatively small,
these users have much better delay performance. Thus,
the attack (in particular, attacks without handoff) effects
of an attacker claiming to be high priority, will be mit-
igated. Its actual impact depends on the extent of sys-
tem manipulation by the attacker. For instance, an at-
tacker may want to opt out the priority set if he or she
needs to stay dormant in order to lower his or her av-
erage throughput value. This can usually be achieved
by keeping the buffer at the base station empty or re-
porting extremely low CQI values. During the attack,
the attacker can opt in the priority set through the fol-
lowing methods: masquerading as a high priority user,
such as a VoIP user, triggering fast retransmissions, and
having large queues (if the queue length is considered in
scheduling decisions).
Round-robin Typically, system designers have to bal-
ance trade offs between short-term performance and
overall throughput. To improve delay performance, (i.e.,
a form of short-term fairness), PF can be combined with
round-robin scheduler with additional constraints such
that each user should get scheduled for m TTIs within
a certain time window w, where m <= w/N and N is
the number of users to be scheduled. Long-term fairness
(e.g., in the pure PF scheduler), on the other hand, guar-
antees that each user obtains roughly the same amount
of time slots over a long period of time (usually dur-
ing the lifetime of a user, on the order of minutes).
Choosing a lower w and a larger m improves short-term
performance but at the expense of lowering the over-
all throughput. Conversly, enlarging w and lowering m
improves overall throughput as the scheduler has more
ﬂexibility in choosing a user with good channel condi-
tions but the expense of short-term performance.
4.2.2 Robust handoff scheduler
All of the considered and proposed variations of the
PF scheduler are conﬁned within the realm of a single
cell–none address the inter-cell issues, namely handoffs.
Consider the case where a user moves from cell A to
cell B and the two base stations could communicate and
assign initial average values for the handoff user. The
optimal initial value of the average throughput for the
user in cell B may not necessarily be the average value in
cell A. This new value will impact both security and sys-
tem performance so it should be set high enough to de-
ter attackers from attacking the system by initiating (fre-
quent) handoffs but not cause excessive delays for nor-
mal users. Therefore, in terms of system performance,
this value should be set to provide smooth transmission
between cells so that the handoff user will not be any
more or any less advantaged compared to the existing
users in the cell. Additionally, to be fair, the newly as-
signed average value should reﬂect the transient behav-
ior of the user.
Consider the special case where the relative channel
ﬂuctuations of users are statistically identical and inde-
pendent. This assumption roughly holds when users ex-
perience Rayleigh fading and the achievable rate is lin-
ear to the channel condition. Note that users can have
different average channel conditions, e.g., depending on
their distance to the base station. Relative channel ﬂuc-
tuation depends only on small-scale fading, such as scat-
tering. Such fading environment is often statistically
identical for all users in a cell. For example, in an urban
environment, users experience rich scattering and thus
Rayleigh fading.
When users experience statistically identical and in-
dependent relative channel ﬂuctuations, multi-user di-
versity gain depends only on the number of users in a
cell and the statistics of the channel ﬂuctuation as shown
in [8]. Assuming stationarity and ergodicity, the expec-
tation of the average throughput of a user, E(R)8, can
be expressed as
E(R) = E(CQI) G(N)
N
(8)
where CQI is a random variable, representing the user’s
channel condition, N is the number of users in the cell,
E(CQI)/N is the average throughput of the user when
N users share the resource evenly without opportunis-
tic scheduling, and G(N) is the opportunistic schedul-
ing gain, which is a function of N and channel statis-
tics. Opportunistic scheduling gain illustrates the perfor-
mance gain of an opportunistic scheduling scheme over
that of non-opportunistic one, namely round-robin. Typ-
ically, the larger the number of users sharing the same
channel, the larger the gain. For example, when users
experience Rayleigh fading with statistically identical
and independent relative channel conditions, we have
G(N) ≈ log(N).
We propose the following heuristic to set the initial
value of a handoff user. Consider that a user moves
from cell A to cell B. Let CQIA and CQIB represent
the channel condition of the user in cells A and B, re-
spectively. Note that CQIA and CQIB are random vari-
ables. Let NA and NB be the number of users in cells
A and B, respectively. Let RA be the current average
rate of the user before handoff. The initial value of after
handoff, Rinit
B , is set as

where E(CQIA)G(NA)/NA is the expected rate
of the user in cell A (following Equation 8) and
E(CQIB)G(NB)/NB is the expected rate of the user in
cell B. In developing this formula one must be cautious
not to set the initial value after handoff to be too high so
as to disadvantage the user. Indeed, the value needs to

may cause some legitimate users to experience unjus-
tiﬁed delays. Typically, however, for a benign user,
the ratio is determined by whether the user is in a fa-
vorable (with respect to its expectation) or a hinder-
ing position. This fact is taken into consideration in
the handoff procedure for fairness. In general, we ex-
pect RA ≈ E(CQIA)G(NA)/NA. We also note that
E(Rinit
B ) = E(RB), which indicates that the user is in
a fair position in the new cell. In other words, Equation 9

the values of RA, NA, and NB are
known. The values of G(·), CQIA, and CQIB can be
estimated. In the presence of attackers, a malicious user
may manipulate its value of CQIB for unfair advan-
tages. We note that a user is often handoff to a cell with
stronger signal strength, i.e., E(CQIB) ≥ E(CQIA).
On the other hand, we do not expect E(CQIB) to be sig-
niﬁcantly higher than E(CQIA), otherwise, the handoff
will be initiated earlier. Therefore, to deter attackers and
to avoid estimations of CQIA and CQIB, we can set
