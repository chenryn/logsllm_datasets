# Add "open Windows terminal here" to right-click context menu?
We know that, for windows 7, by default when we click "shift + right click
with mouse" when we enter into a folder without selecting anything, we can see
the option "open command window here".

While for windows 10, by default when we click "shift + right click with
mouse", we can see the option "open powershell window here".
So for Windows 10 (version later than 1903), how can we make the following
three options available in right-click context menu?
  * open command window here
  * open powershell window here
  * open Windows terminal here
Looking forward to your reply, thanks a lot~
