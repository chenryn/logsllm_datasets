User: I have an GAE app, and I deploy it on 2 different domains, and they use separate datastores.
However, right now it is done by having two identical folders with different app.yaml configurations. 
If I make changes I need to copy all files again. Is there an elegant solution for that, like having two app.yaml files in the same folder?
Assistant: Assuming you are avoiding Nick's suggestion for some particular reason, the next best thing would be to include the copying process in your build system.  1 When you build your deploy target, maven/make/ant/"your favorite build tool" should check out copies of your latest revision from your source control system into separate directories, then copy in or rename the appropriate yaml files. 2

You do have an automated build process, right?  If not that should be very high on your list if you are striving for elegance.
You are using source control, right?  I refuse to entertain the notion that you aren't, because that would be downright ridiculous.
