# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
When I click the button to lazy-load a module which was already been
prefetched (I can see it in the network tab), another network request for the
same module is done.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
Minimal repository: test-webpack-dynamic-import-prefetch
**What is the expected behavior?**
If the button is clicked that lazy-module should be called from the browser's
cache without additional network request.
