Abstract—Satellite broadband services are critical infrastruc-
tures, bringing connectivity to the most remote regions of the
globe. However, due to performance concerns, many geostation-
ary satellite broadband services are unencrypted and vulnerable
to long-range eavesdropping attacks. This paper delves into the
underlying cause of these issues, presenting the case that the
widespread use of Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) for
TCP optimization has created a security/performance trade-off.
A review of previous mitigation proposals ﬁnds limited real-world
adoption due to a variety of factors ranging from misaligned
commercial incentives to the prevalence of unveriﬁed “black-box”
encryption products.
To address these shortcomings, we design and implement
a fully open-source and encrypted-by-default PEP/VPN hybrid,
called QPEP. Built around the QUIC standard, QPEP enables
individuals to encrypt satellite trafﬁc without ISP involvement.
Additionally, we present an open and replicable Docker-based
testbed for benchmarking QPEP, and other PEP applications,
through simulation. These experiments show that QPEP enables
satellite customers to encrypt their TCP trafﬁc with up to
72% faster page load times (PLTs) compared to traditional
VPN encryption. Even relative to other unencrypted PEPs,
QPEP offers up to 54% faster PLTs while also protecting
communications in transit. We brieﬂy discuss how QPEP might
leverage bespoke modiﬁcations to the QUIC protocol for further
optimization. Ultimately, our experiments suggest that QPEP’s
hybrid architecture represents a promising new technique for
bringing both security and performance to satellite broadband
while avoiding costly alterations to status-quo networks.

INTRODUCTION
Historically, security and performance have often traded-
off in satellite broadband networks. As a result, many satellite
internet service providers (ISPs) do not offer over-the-air trafﬁc
encryption, exposing sensitive customer data to eavesdropping
attacks. This is because techniques used to optimize TCP con-
nections in long-distance satellite links are often incompatible
with commonly used encryption techniques, such as VPNs.
Since the early 2000s, academics and satellite operators
have grappled with the challenge of offering both encrypted
and performant TCP over satellite. In Section III we highlight

notable proposals and discus why they have seen limited real-
world adoption. While some encryption systems exist, these
follow a “black-box” model and are inaccessible and costly
for smaller organizational and individual customers. Moreover,
their proprietary nature makes security and performance claims
difﬁcult to verify and most permit ISPs to eavesdrop on trafﬁc.
No open-source encryption tool exists for performant TCP
communications over satellite links. Although academic pro-
posals are numerous,
these are often purely theoretical or
lack replicable source-code. As a result, interested researchers
must either repurpose outdated code to incorporate modern
encryption or reinvent PEPs from scratch. The combined
requirements of cryptography and low-level network program-
ming create steep barriers to entry. Moreover, the lack of stan-
dardized testing environments makes comparing approaches
difﬁcult without privileged access to satellite infrastructure.
The end result is that satellite broadband users have no
good options. They (or their ISPs) must purchase expensive
and unvetted proprietary applications, accept the substantial
performance hit caused by general-purpose VPNs, or transmit
sensitive data in clear text over massive satellite footprints.
This paper seeks to address both the lack of encryption
options and high barriers to research in this domain. Its primary
contribution is QPEP - an open-source and encrypted-by-
default PEP. Unlike many proprietary encrypted PEPs, QPEP
is designed for individual satellite customers and conceals
trafﬁc from both eavesdroppers and ISPs. Built around the
open QUIC transportation protocol, QPEP beneﬁts from ro-
bustly vetted cryptographic foundations and a broad technical
community. The system is implemented in Go, an accessible
modern language, to facilitate contributions in future research.
As a secondary contribution, the paper presents an open-
source simulation testbed, built around the OpenSAND satel-
lite networking engine [1]. This all-in-one dockerized environ-
ment is tailored towards rapid and replicable benchmarking for
secure PEP applications. While it has immediate utility in our
evaluation of QPEP, it is also designed to ease future system
proposals and comparisons from others.
Within this environment, we demonstrate that QPEP
achieves its design goals. It nearly halves average page load
times compared to traditional VPNs and substantially improves
on the performance of even unencrypted PEP applications.
Additional simulations are conducted to assess QPEP’s perfor-
mance under various network conditions and in the presence of
modiﬁcations to the QUIC standard. Ultimately, we ﬁnd that
QPEP represents a promising solution for performant over-the-
air encryption in satellite networks while avoiding investment
in new infrastructure or alteration of existing protocols.
II. MOTIVATION
The prevalence of security and performance trade-offs
in modern satellite broadband networks may initially seem
unintuitive. After all,
the dangers of unencrypted wireless
communications are well understood and have been robustly
mitigated in systems ranging from home wiﬁ to cellular com-
munications. Today, the decision of a terrestrial wireless ISP to
offer unencrypted broadband services could, not unreasonably,
be attributed to ignorance or incompetence.
This is not
the case for long-range satellite communi-
cations. Severe security and privacy issues arising from the
use of unencrypted broadband services from Geostationary
Earth Orbit (GEO) have been known since at least 2005 [2].
However, our own experimental studies have found that, ﬁfteen
years later, tens of thousands of satellite customers still rely
on unencrypted GEO links [3]–[5]. Deeply sensitive data
is readily observed by eavesdroppers with access to simple
home-television equipment - affecting customers ranging from
individual home internet subscribers to massive corporations.
In the process of responsibly disclosing these vulnera-
bilities both to satellite ISPs and to their customers, our
initial advice was simply to employ proven existing encryption
techniques (e.g. IPSec). We quickly learned that this solution
was somewhat naive and overlooked signiﬁcant technical and
cultural barriers unique to the satellite context.
In response to our disclosure efforts, satellite ISPs would
often espouse the opinion that encryption was a duty which
fell to individual customers. They were generally uninterested
in deploying costly network-wide security protections, or al-
ready offered them, but only as a premium service add-on
for particularly risk adverse clients (e.g. military customers).
Occasionally, they would emphasize the importance of access
to clear-text
trafﬁc headers in order to optimize network
performance - increasing customer satisfaction.
When speaking with customers, they would acknowledge
the value of encryption in the abstract, but were unwilling
to accept substantial performance reductions caused by the
use of end-to-end encryption tools such as VPNs. In some
cases, they had already attempted to deploy VPNs but ended
up removing them at the suggestion of their ISP to resolve
these performance issues. Indeed, the support pages of many
satellite ISP websites suggest the disabling of VPN software
as a remediation for slow internet services [6], [7]. The most
information-security conscious customers we contacted had
attempted to employ piecemeal application-layer protections,
such as replacing HTTP web-servers with HTTPS services.
However, we found signiﬁcant gaps in these defenses such
as unencrypted DNS trafﬁc or sensitive data from overlooked
systems (e.g. a legacy FTP server or POP3 email service).
The principal motivation of this research is to present an
approach which considers the unique technical and commercial
requirements of these stakeholders. We design and implement
a tool which empowers individual customers to encrypt the
entirety of their satellite network connection by default, while

travel from the customer to the satellite (Step 1) before being redirected down
to the ISP’s ground-station equipment (Step 2). From there it would be routed
as normal IP trafﬁc to the internet (Step 3). This process then occurs in reverse
traveling back from the internet to the ISP’s ground-station (Step A), up to
GEO orbit (Step B), and down to the customer’s dish (Step C). It’s worth
noting that the forward link signal (Step C) is a typically sent on a wide beam,
with footprints measuring on the order of millions of square kilometers.
maintaining performance that is on-par with, or better than,
the unencrypted services they use today. Critically, our design
requires no network changes or satellite ISP involvement.
In addition to proposing this new system, the paper delves
into many of the performance characteristics of our implemen-
tation. Our motivation in doing so is to demonstrate that our ap-
proach offers meaningful performance beneﬁts over traditional
VPN tools. Beyond this core hypothesis, signiﬁcant additional
detail is provided to facilitate replicability and comparative
benchmarking. We provide open-source implementations not
just of our tool, but also for each of the experiments run in the
paper. This is because we recognize that, while our approach
is a substantial and needed improvement, it is unlikely the
only (or best) way to secure these networks. A key secondary
motivation is thus to provide a framework and starting point
for others interested in this topic area.
III. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Understanding the security/performance trade-off requires
a closer look at TCP behavior over satellite. This section
provides an overview of our threat model, key defensive
challenges, and prior work to address them.
A. The Eavesdropping Threat Model
Our focus is on broadband provided from platforms in
geostationary earth orbit (GEO). The basic operation of GEO
broadband can be thought of as a “bent pipe” (see Figure 1).
As GEO is located more than 30,000 km away from the Earth’s
surface, a single satellite has line of sight to a vast area on the
surface (theoretically as much as 40% of the Earth’s surface,
but practically closer to 20% for broadband communications).
This has the advantage of making GEO broadband a relatively
inexpensive mechanism of providing global service. Only a

coverage (barring some polar areas).
targeted towards speciﬁc users. As a result,
An eavesdropping attacker is greatly aided by these cov-
erage characteristics as emissions from GEO satellites are
not
the radio
waves reaching an attacker’s antenna could be carrying trafﬁc
intended for an entire continent of satellite customers. Since
these are consumer-oriented networks, the equipment neces-
sary for eavesdropping on such signals is inexpensive and
widely available [3], [4], [8]. With the rise of software deﬁned
radios, even more complex protocols are within the reach of
relatively unsophisticated attackers [4], [9].
In light of this threat, it is not intuitively clear why status
quo satellite broadband services fail to encrypt customer trafﬁc.
The main barrier is physical. Speed of light delays over the
30,000 km hop to GEO are substantial and round-trip latency
can exceed 600 ms. Latency can be reduced with closer
satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) but this increases costs and
complexity. While LEO offers as little as 50 ms in speed-
of-light latency, satellites only maintain line of sight for a
matter of minutes. Consistent global coverage thus requires
hundreds of satellites. Status quo LEO constellations can still
experience round-trip delays of up to 1,500 ms depending on
the route a message travels [10]. Thus, while in-development
constellations have made ambitious claims, satellite latency
will likely remain relevant for some time [11], [12].
B. TCP Performance Over Satellite
To understand how latency discourages encryption, one
must consider its impact on TCP performance. In this paper,
we focus on standard TCP implementations on the assump-
tion that forcing satellite customers to use alternatives (e.g.
TCP-Hybla) is infeasible [13]. We outline two of the most
prominent issues here but many others have been extensively
characterized in prior work [14]–[17].
1) Barriers to TCP in Satellite Networks: The ﬁrst chal-
lenge to TCP performance in satellite networks arises from
the requirement that TCP data packets are responded to with
an acknowledgment (ACK) message [17]. The effect is com-
pounded by the three-way handshake which, in the best case,
takes upwards of 1,500 ms to complete over GEO. When
visiting a website with embedded images and related ﬁles,
many three-way handshakes may be required - compound-
ing delays. Although modern implementations may employ
various optimizations to bundle or reduce the total number
of ACKs, these are not tailored for satellite networks [14].
Further, in some legacy devices, ACKs may be elicited by
every packet, greatly increasing perceived latency [18], [19].
The second challenge arises from TCP congestion control
and TCP “slow-start” initialization [14]. TCP slow-start grad-
ually increases the ratio of data segments to ACKs until a
desired congestion window is reached. The time this process
takes is thus a function of round-trip times (RTT) over the
satellite link. Even once a connection has reached optimal
window size, packet loss can be misidentiﬁed as a sign of
congestion and cause the slow-start sequence to restart. While
modern satellites are more reliable than in the past, packet
loss is still common compared to terrestrial networks. As a

result, TCP sessions are both slow to maximize their bandwidth
usage, and, once maximized, struggle to maintain that state.
These are but two factors among dozens, ranging from
speciﬁc TCP option implementations to congestion control
implications of link asymmetry [17]. Satellite network designs
create a uniquely hostile environment for TCP.
2) PEPs: The most common approach to optimizing TCP
trafﬁc over satellite environments is the use of a class of
appliances called “Performance Enhancing Proxies” or PEPs
and loosely described in IETF RFC 3135 [20]. PEPs differ
substantially and many implementations are proprietary and
inaccessible to researchers. However, IETF RFC 3153 outlines
a few basic principles that apply to most PEPs.
