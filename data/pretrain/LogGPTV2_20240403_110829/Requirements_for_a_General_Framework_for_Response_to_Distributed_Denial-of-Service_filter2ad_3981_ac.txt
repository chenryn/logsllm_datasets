•  Scalable  –  The  framework  needs  to  be  equally 
applicable  to  a  small-scale  network  as  it  does  a 
large distributed internet. 
•  Reaction – The victim must be very clear on the 
policy  of  normal  operation  and  the  policy  of 
dealing with hostile incidents. 
From the list of requirements that have been derived from 
a wide survey, it can be shown that no existing technique 
or  system  currently  can  meet  all  these  requirements  and 
the  requirements  that  will  almost  certainly  be  derived 
from further investigation.

The  focus  of  research  for  future  work  is  on  system 
response to a large-scale network producer flood incident. 
For a large distributed network to effectively recover from 
such an incident requires time and a fault tolerant capacity 
to  move  to  a  stable  state.  If  a  network  incident  is  not 
caused  by  ‘normal’  random  anomalous  behaviour,  but  is 
rather a co-ordinated hostile incident, it is conjectured that 
the  only  effective  response 
to 
deliberately co-ordinate the stabilising procedure. This co-
ordinated  stabilisation  should  ensure  that  the  critical 
functions  within  the  network  could  be  restored  in  near 
optimal  time.  Research  issues  that  will  be  of  critical 
importance to develop a framework that can manage these 
incidents would be: 
1)  Derive  ‘Policy  Primitives’.  These  primitives  can  be 
used  to  represent  the  states  of  the  operational 
behaviour  of  systems.  The  objective  is  to  find  the 
implementation 
that  are 
needed to understand system operation for interaction 
with  other  network  entities.  It  is  hypothesised  that 
these  policy  primitives  are  needed  for  negotiation 
between heterogeneous and more importantly ‘hetro-
policy’  systems  when  trying  to  reach  mutually 
acceptable states. This level of system co-operation is 
currently  unheard  of  and  therefore  the  issue  of 
acceptable  co-operation  through  policy  is  crucial. 
Research  issues  such  as  at  what  level  of  abstraction 
can  the  operational  policies  be  accurately  modelled 
need  to  be  addressed.  The  co-operation  of  different 
administrative  systems  indicates  a  confidentiality 
problem. There must be detailed investigation into the 
effective  communication  of 
fair  and  accurate 
operational  policies  between  different  administrative 
systems.   
independent  constraints 
2)  There  is  a  need  for  detailed  analysis  of  network 
behaviour and traffic analysis. This work alone is not 
new,  however  there  is  need  for  hard  empirical  data 
concerning how systems react as mass flood incidents 
are  occurring.  This  empirical  data  combined  with 
theoretical  work  concerning  network  architecture 
design  will  give  an  important  indication  to  the 
response time that is available for response. Research 
issues are the effects of differing network topologies, 
differing 
implementations  on  specific  operating 
systems  and  the  different  types  of  incidents.  The 
speed that networks fail when subjected to incidents, 
and  the  timing  between  the  anticipated  stages  of 
degradation  is  critical  and  currently  there  is  no 
information in  the  public  domain to  give indications 
concerning 
timings  and  bands  of 
degradation  will  act  as  guides  to  determine  what  is 
technically feasible for the framework to regard as an 
adequate  response  and  to  assess  this  against  what  is 
realistically  and  theoretically  acceptable  as  adequate 
response.

3) 
Integration  of  stabilising  techniques  to  develop  the 
framework  to  respond  to  incidents.  The  area  of 
network theory that is concerned with stabilisation of 
network is well  understood and documented  such as 
in  [9].  However  this  is  a  developing  field  and  this 
project  would  have  to  examine  issues  such  as 
negotiation  of  network  links,  dynamic  routing  and 
capacity  determination.  Work  within  network  theory 
often  considers  a  link  to  be  operation  or  failed. 
However study is needed to evaluate this with respect 
to denial of service, as there are few occasions when a 
link is totally failed, but rather the traffic can variably 
be  greater  than  the  receiving  capacity.  Also  the 
network  theory  considers failures to  be the nodes  or 
link failures. Denial of service needs to be determined 
to  be  either  a  link  or  node  or  perhaps  a  third  as  yet 
unknown 
the  algorithm 
developed within network theory can be modified to 
optimise recovery from such incidents.

Summary 
There are many specific problems, exploits and solutions 
associated  with  network  denial  of  service.  No-one  has 
however presented a general solution that is adequate for 
managing  denial  of  service  incidents.  There  are  two 
possible  directions  for  managing  denial  of  service 
incidents, the prevention or the detection and response of 
incidents. It has been argued that prevention is intractable 
by  Gilgor  and  as  such  response  is  considered  a  valid 
research direction. 
Operational  policy  is  critical  to  the  examination  of 
network  Producer  incidents,  as  they  are  caused  by 
transactions  that  violate  the  policy.  From  the  argument 
that  managing  Distributed  Co-ordinated  Attack  incidents 
will  require  distributed  co-operative  response  by  several 
systems,  it  can  be  seen  that  those  systems  would  be 
required 
to  policy  directed  strategies  for 
managing  the  incidents.  That  essentially  means  that  the 
stabilization protocols would need to be acceptable to all 
the  systems  involved  in  the  co-operative  response  and 
therefore  require  those  multiple  systems  to  agree  on  an 
effective policy or strategy.   
The details of the response scenarios need to be examined 
as  does  the  generic  policy  requirements  of  network 
entities,  while  these  factors  are  of  immediate  concern  to 
the  research  into  the  development  of  a  framework  for 
response to denial of service incidents.    
5. Conclusion 
This paper has highlighted that denial of service is not a 
new  problem  and  there  have  been  many  solutions 
proposed for managing denial of service incidents. There 
has been a detailed investigation into the nature of denial 
of service and the Consumer and Producer problems have 
both  been  identified.  Although  both  problems  are  of

concern  to  network  entities,  the  Producer  problem  has 
been  identified  as  a  more  serious  problem  as  it  can  be 
simply invoked by a system providing sufficient resources 
to another system in violation of normal operating policy. 
The nature of the Internet does not allow the victim choice 
about what it receives, and therefore a victim system has 
very  few  options  in  what  it  can  do  to  respond  to  such 
incidents. 
Two research  directions have become apparent from this 
investigation:  Prevention  and  Response.  It  is  argued  that 
to prevent this kind of policy violation exploitation would 
require  major  changes  to  the  protocols  that  drive  the 
Internet,  which  is  realistically  unfeasible;  therefore  there 
must be in-depth analysis of response to such incidents.

Future  work  seeks  to  achieve  a  general  framework  that 
can realistically respond to distributed producer denial of 
service  flood  incidents.  It  will  do  this  by  developing  a 
policy  directed  co-operative  and  adaptable  framework. 
This framework will permit network entities to determine 
an optimal state that they wish to be at when they are in a 
degraded condition and this framework will allow them to 
negotiate  steps  to  achieve  that  co-operative  state.  It  is 
presumed a certain amount of load balancing or adaptive 
routing will be required to achieve this goal. Currently this 
research project has only highlighted the crucial need for 
the  policy  directed  adaptability  and  can  only  hint  at  the 
other research issues to affect this framework.
