for which a takedown initially has a positive effect, but where, in
the long term, wickedness actually increases. One prominent ex-
ample is the Czech Republic following the Bredolab/ Spamit.com
takedowns, which saw a no significant decrease in wickedness the
week of the takedown, but a near doubling in the following six
weeks. Country-by-country there is little correspondence to the
global takedown effect. For example, the McColo takedown saw
initial success followed by global increases in spam on both a
global and regional level. However, at the country level the results
are mixed, with Belarus benefiting from the takedown while
Romania, Hungary, and Russia experience increases at 6 weeks.
These regional results raise the interesting possibility that bot-
nets can migrate in response to takedowns. That is, by reducing
the number of infected hosts in one region, a takedown creates in-
centives for botnets to find new vulnerable hosts, thus moving the
problem elsewhere. In this work we do not investigate this issue
further; more advanced modeling techniques, such as vector autore-
gressive models [2], could shed light on this intriguing possibility.
6. RELATED WORK
specific infection mechanisms, while our model considers the
security problem from a global perspective, with botnets being
just one component. We find that most botnet takedowns have
limited and transient impacts on global wickedness. This result
agrees with other research, which found that botnets are surpris-
ingly resilient [81], and in many cases they recover after a short
time [54]. Other work has modeled malicious websites, noting the
high variance of cybersecurity data, and investigates interventions
through modeling [13].
General traffic filtering is an important intervention for reduc-
ing the number of infected hosts. There has been research into
the effectiveness of various filtering techniques, e.g. [45, 27, 60],
however this work focuses on the success of the filter itself and
not whether the filter actually reduces the global distribution
of infected hosts. Incorporating filtering interventions into our
model is an area we plan to explore in future work.
7. DISCUSSION
Data-driven models such as the one presented here can poten-
tially yield interesting and important insights, which in turn can
inform policy makers about the utility of interventions or even
how to prepare vulnerable regions of the world before they are
applied. However, there are several pitfalls that any modeling
approach needs to heed.
First, the model is built around statistical correlations, but it
ignores precise mechanisms, e.g. by what process does a country’s
development and an ISP’s position in the ISP network influence
wickedness? Second, statistical models such as ours cannot deter-
mine causality, so detailed understanding of the data is needed to
attribute cause and effect. Third, high variance data can hide sig-
nificant changes, and also make it appear that significant change
has occurred when it has not. Modeling global data is a powerful
tool to address this issue, but the modeling methodology must
take into account the variance (e.g., averages can be misleading).
We are careful to use appropriate methodology to avoid this pitfall.
Finally, any conclusions drawn from a statistical model depend
on the quality of the data (although techniques do exist to help
compensate for certain classes of data problems).
Any model is necessarily a simplification of reality. For example,
our traffic model is simplistic given the complexity of the Internet.
Future work could incorporate more realistic models, especially
because our model shows that the traffic component is significant
only during the third era. It could be that spam email was more
likely to be used to spread infection during this era, whereas
earlier it was used primarily for advertising, e.g. gray market phar-
maceuticals. Similar to the traffic component, if other important
features are identified, such as the type of service provided by an
ISP, this information could easily be included in the model.
This paper focused on spam itself, but spam data have also
been used to estimate the numbers of infected PCs [83, 70, 26].
By applying our methodology to other measures of infection, it
should be possible to develop models that provide insight into the
dynamics and global distribution of these other types of infections.
In general, we are interested in the distribution of all malicious
behavior (or wickedness), regardless of its source. In some cases,
the definition of wickedness could be expanded, e.g to include the
relative value of hosts in different regions—an infected machine
in the US may be more valuable than one in India.
Cybersecurity is often viewed as an arms race, which complicates
the task of predicting the impact of today’s interventions against
tomorrow’s attackers. At least, however, we should evaluate the
likely effect of new methods before embracing large-scale deploy-
ments or policy directives that enforce certain interventions, and
models such as the one described here are one way to approach this.
We have studied the impact of botnet takedowns in some detail,
but there are other interventions that would also be interesting to
explore. For example, the traffic model provides a way to analyze
the effect of blacklisting offending ISPs or different filtering strate-
gies [24]. There is evidence that national and international initia-
tives against cybercrime can reduce wickedness [73]. Our model
could, for example, be used to assess whether countries that are sig-
natories to agreements such as the London Action Plan or Council
of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime actually experience lower
wickedness levels after ratifying the agreements. This could be
studied by incorporating this information as an additional variable.
By looking for differential effects of takedowns geographically,
we can identify at risk ISPs or countries, i.e. those that are likely
to see little initial effect from the takedown but which could expect
an increase in wickedness in the medium term. Our results to date
have not identified any single factor that is consistently correlated
(at a statistically significant level) with increased wickedness after
a takedown. However, if we could identify at-risk countries and
ISPs, they might make good candidates for targeted interventions,
for example, ISPs on the periphery of the AS network which
may have inadequate spam-fighting resources and lack automated
methods to help customers clean up malware. Government in-
terventions could focus on providing resources to those ISPs (or
even countries), an approach that might prove more cost-effective
than existing methods.
8. CONCLUSION
With unprecedented numbers of people now connected to and
depending on the Internet (three billion in 2014 [72]), it is im-
perative that we understand and mitigate global cybersecurity
threats. Further, we need to understand regional variations, and
why some parts of the world and some corners of the Internet
are disproportionately affected.
In this paper we studied an abstract quantity called wicked-
ness (concentration of spam sending hosts) and showed that it
clusters regionally, correlating with national demographics and
certain properties of the ISP graph. Through the use of statistical
modeling combined with a large dataset, we studied some of the
factors affecting spam, a large-scale security problem distributed
around the world. Leveraging a long-term historical view of data
produced interesting insights about the effectiveness of certain
cybersecurity interventions. We found that takedowns are only
marginally effective in many cases, and in fact may be harmful
to certain countries and ISPs.
Our model could serve as a starting point to predict future
wickedness and test the likely effect of new interventions, both for
spam and other similar problems. Our ultimate goal is to provide
researchers and policy makers objective means to test intervention
strategies and decide how best to mitigate global wickedness.
