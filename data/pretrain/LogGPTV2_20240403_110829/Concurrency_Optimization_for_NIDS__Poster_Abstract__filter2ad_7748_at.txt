outcome for various neurological diseases Microdialysis is a powerful technique for in vivo sampling of extracellular fluid in the brain, thereby 
enabling the continuous measurement of neurotransmitters in freely-moving animals However, metabolic analysis of microdialysis samples can be 
considered a huge analytical challenge due to limited sample amounts and low basal (nanomolar-range) concentrations of many metabolites In this 
study, we have developed a capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) method for the profiling of amino acids and related compounds in 
rat brain microdialysates using direct sample injection CE was coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) employing a co-axial sheath-
liquid interface and a bare fused-silica capillary Amino acids were analyzed at low-pH separation conditions using 10% acetic acid (pH 22) as 
separation buffer To increase the concentration sensitivity of CE-MS, an in-capillary preconcentration procedure was applied, which allowed large 
volume sample injections The developed CE-MS system allowed the direct analysis of amino acids in rat brain microdialysis samples after only 
applying a centrifugation step Low nanomolar detection limits could be obtained for the compounds with minimal sample matrix effects Overall, we 
propose here the first CE-MS method for the direct profiling of amino acids and related compounds in rat brain microdialysate samples The utility of 
this approach will be tested by analyzing a large set of rat brain microdialysate samples in a pharmacokinetic and biomarker discovery context using 
metabolomics

Impact of preservation conditions on the fecal metabolome and lipidome
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Margot De Spiegeleer, Ghent University, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Steve Huysman, Lieven Van Meulebroek, Lynn Vanhaecke
Eminent attention towards fecal fingerprinting is emerging, in that it may unravel the symbiotic interplay between the host, diet and intestinal 
ecosystem and yield characteristic signatures of responsive metabolic discrepancies regarding gut (patho)physiology and beyond However, it 
is instrumental to capture and conserve a realistic snapshot that is reflective for the dynamic metabolome covered upon (outpatient) sampling to 
circumvent erroneous interpretations and subsequent deceptive associations regarding the disease and parameter(s) under observation Hence, 
this study tackles the present-day lack of preservation guidelines regarding the stability of the fecal polar metabolome and lipidome, using in-house 
developed and validated extraction and UHPLC-HR-Q-Orbitrap-MS methods (Vanden Bussche et al, 2015 & Van Meulebroek et al, 2017, Anal 
Chem) By means of targeted profiling (n>400) and untargeted fingerprinting in concert with univariate and multivariate data analysis, the effect(s) 
of freeze-thawing (up to 2 cycles) and storage duration (up to 25 weeks), integrated with storage temperature (-20°C and -80°C) and (an)aerobicity 
were assessed For the polar metabolome fraction, the impact of aerobicity was concluded to be negligible, which was ascribed to lyophilization 
of the fecal material Conversely, freeze-thawing was pointed out to significantly affect metabolome composition with the first cycle being 
predominant For example, elevated concentration levels were observed for amines and amino acids Monitoring the long-term stability, particularly 
the low-molecular-weight metabolites (150 subjects in each study) 
Serum and dried serum spots were collected from children and one untargeted UPLC-MS assays (C18 reversed phase) were applied to analyse 
plasma and urine metabolites followed by univariate and multivariate analysis Markers indicative of increased blood retinol levels included (lyso)
glycerophospholipids, ceramides and acyl glycerides as was observed for the pig study Conclusions: Potential markers of vitamin A levels and 
hypervitaminosis A have been identified in a pig model and validated in two independent human studies

Alcohol consumption leads to tissue damage However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the damage remain to be fully understood 
Our goal was to identify pathways affected in the liver caused by chronic alcohol consumption Eight – 10 wk old male C57BL/6J mice were fed 
a modified ethanol-containing liquid diet Lieber-DeCarli (LD) (ethanol-treated, n=4) or an ethanol-free LD diet (control, n=5) for 6 wks Mice on 
the ethanol diet started at 2% (v/v) and ethanol was increased 1% weekly over 5 wks, until 6% (v/v) was applied At the end of the sixth week, the 
livers collected underwent blinded histological examination and untargeted metabolomic analyses Multivariate analyses determined differences 
in the metabolic profiles between ethanol-treated and control mice Targeted metabolomic analyses was subsequently performed to quantify 
significant features uncovered in the untargeted metabolomic analyses Histological examination revealed no inflammatory or injury differences; 
however, enlarged bile ducts were observed in the ethanol-treated mice The most prominent change in the metabolic profile of ethanol-treated 
mice occurred in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway Utilizing targeted metabolomics, we quantified 19 bile acids Of these, significant (P<005) 
increases in the primary bile acid cholic acid (50-fold), and its taurine- and glycine- conjugated bile acids, including taurodeoxycholic acid (20-fold), 
taurohyodeoxycholic acid (30-fold), glycocholic acid (115-fold) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (48-fold) were observed in the ethanol-treated 
mice Our study provides new insights into hepatic changes occurring early during chronic alcohol consumption How the dysregulated bile acid 
pathway may contribute to liver damage remains to be established

Metabolomics may reveal novel insights into the aetiology of prostate cancer, for which few risk factors are established We investigated the 
association between patterns in baseline plasma metabolite profile and subsequent prostate cancer risk, using data from 3057 matched case-
control sets from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) We measured 119 metabolite concentrations in plasma 
samples, collected on average 94 years before diagnosis, by mass spectrometry (AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit, Biocrates Life Sciences AG) Metabolite 
patterns were identified using treelet transform, a statistical method for identification of groups of correlated metabolites Associations of metabolite 
patterns with prostate cancer risk (OR[1SD]) were estimated by conditional logistic regression Supplementary analyses were conducted for 
metabolite patterns derived using principal component analysis and for individual metabolites Men with metabolite profiles characterised by 
higher concentrations of either phosphatidylcholines and hydroxysphingomyelins (OR[1SD]=077, 95%CI 066-089), acylcarnitines C18:1 and C18:2, 
glutamate, ornithine and taurine (OR[1SD]=072, 057-090), or lysophosphatidylcholines (OR[1SD]=081, 069-095) had lower risk of advanced stage 
prostate cancer at diagnosis, with no evidence of heterogeneity by follow-up time Similar associations were observed for the two former patterns 
with aggressive disease risk (the more aggressive subset of advanced stage), while the latter pattern was inversely related to risk of prostate cancer 
death (OR[1SD]=077, 061-096) No associations were observed for prostate cancer overall or less aggressive tumour subtypes In conclusion, 
metabolite patterns may be related to lower risk of more aggressive prostate tumours and prostate cancer death, and might be relevant to aetiology 
of advanced stage prostate cancer

Alcoholic liver disease remains a leading cause of chronic liver disease, with increased morbidity and mortality In recent years, biomarkers 
discovered through metabolomics have shed light on disease biochemistry, arousing interest in ethanol-induced biochemical perturbations In this 
study the metabolic profiles of mouse cerebral tissue following short- or long-term ethanol exposure were analyzed The long-term experiment (8 
weeks) consisted of C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks old) separated into control and ad libitum feeding with a Lieber-DeCarli ethanol diet group for 8 
weeks containing daily 5% alcohol 99% The short-term animal experiment was conducted over 11 days In addition, a single dose by oral gavage 
of 25% alcohol, at the 5th day of the intervention and at the last day of experiment 6 hours before sacrifice were administrated The experiment 
was conducted in agreement with current national and European legislation (Ν 2015/1992, ΠΔ 56/2013, European guideline 2010/63) and cerebral 
tissues were collected postmortem Untargeted metabolic profiling analysis was performed using HRAM Q-TOF-MS (LCMS-9030, Shimadzu) with 
precursor and product ion scanning at 50 spectra per second within a mass range of m/z 50-1000 Univariate statistical analysis revealed that the 
short-term experiment decreased arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, glycerophosphocholine, CDP-choline, adenine, adenosine, cytidine, 
creatine, creatinine, valine and taurine along with some phospholipids Long-term exposure decreased acetyl-carnitine, adenine and adenosine 
with phospholipids and ceramides, while many amino acids were increased along with hypoxanthine, xanthine, oxoproline, choline, creatinine, and
