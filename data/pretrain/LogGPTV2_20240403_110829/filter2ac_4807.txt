**Title: Botconf 2019: Insights and Trends in the Data-Center Security Landscape**

We have deployed a large collection of high-interaction deception servers across multiple cloud environments worldwide. Each of these deception machines is designed to capture and record attacks on various services. This infrastructure provides us with a wealth of data, allowing us to observe the origin of attacks, the machines they connect back to, the ports and services targeted, the processes initiated, and much more.

By leveraging this unique and comprehensive dataset, we can analyze attack patterns and model the behavior of attackers. In this presentation, we will guide the audience through our analysis and share some interesting findings. For example, do attackers change their behavior after new vulnerabilities are disclosed? What is the typical lifespan of an attack machine or a command-and-control server? Do attackers make efforts to maintain persistence on victim machines?

Using our results, we aim to provide a clearer picture of the current landscape of data-center-oriented cyber attacks.
