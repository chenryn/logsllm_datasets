I'm trying to connect to a local websocket server.
`socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:30003");`
The socket never connects properly. When I try to do `socket.send()`, it
throws a DOMException:
`Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'send' on 'WebSocket': Still in
CONNECTING state.`
It works fine in Chrome 43. I've also tried running this code inside the Atom
editor, it doesn't work.
