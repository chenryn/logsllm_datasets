### Threat Analysis

**Definition:**
- The C-SCRA threat analysis evaluates and characterizes the level of threat to the integrity, trustworthiness, and authenticity of the product, service, or supplier. This analysis is based on a threat actor’s capability and intent to compromise or exploit the product, service, or supplier being introduced into the supply chain.

**Threat Levels:**
- **Critical:** Information indicates that an adversarial or non-adversarial threat is imminent (e.g., an adversary is actively engaged in subversion, exploitation, or sabotage of the product, service, or supplier).
- **High:** Information indicates that an adversarial or non-adversarial threat is imminent (e.g., significant drought in the geographical area combined with location characteristics of the asset yields high potential for forest fires).
- **Moderate:** Information indicates that an adversarial or non-adversarial threat has an average potential to impact or target the enterprise (e.g., a specific adversarial threat exists but lacks either the capability or the intent to engage in subversion, exploitation, or sabotage of the product, service, or supplier).
- **Low:** Information indicates that adversarial or non-adversarial threats are non-existent, unlikely, or have below average potential to impact or target the enterprise (e.g., adversarial threats lack both the capability and the intent to engage in subversion, exploitation, or sabotage of the product, service, or supplier).

**Information Gathering:**
- C-SCRM PMOs and requestors should leverage the Information Gathering and Scoping questionnaire to coordinate the collection of information related to the product, service, or supplier’s operational details, ownership structure, key management personnel, financial information, business ventures, government restrictions, and potential threats. Additional investigations should be performed if red flags are observed during initial data collection.

### Vulnerability Analysis

**Definition:**
- The C-SCRA vulnerability analysis evaluates and characterizes the vulnerability of the product, service, or supplier throughout its life cycle and/or engagement. The analysis includes an assessment of the ease of exploitation by a threat actor with moderate capabilities.

**Vulnerability Levels:**
- **Critical:** The product, service, or supplier contains vulnerabilities or weaknesses that are wholly exposed and easily exploitable.
- **High:** The product, service, or supplier contains vulnerabilities or weaknesses that are highly exposed and reasonably exploitable.
- **Moderate:** The product, service, or supplier contains vulnerabilities or weaknesses that are moderately exposed and difficult to exploit.
- **Low:** The product, service, or supplier contains vulnerabilities and weaknesses with limited exposure and are unlikely to be exploited.

**Information Gathering:**
- C-SCRM PMOs and requestors should coordinate the collection of information related to the product, service, or supplier’s operational details, exploitability, service details, attributes of known vulnerabilities, and mitigation techniques.

### Impact Analysis

**Definition:**
- The C-SCRA impact analysis evaluates and characterizes the impact of the product, service, or supplier throughout its life cycle and/or engagement. The analysis includes an end-to-end functional review to identify critical functions and components based on an assessment of the potential harm caused by the probable loss, damage, or compromise of a product, material, or service to an enterprise’s operations or mission.

**Impact Levels:**
- **Critical:** The product, service, or supplier’s failure to perform as designed would result in a total enterprise failure or a significant and/or unacceptable level of degradation of operations that could only be recovered with exceptional time and resources.
- **High:** The product, service, or supplier’s failure to perform as designed would result in severe enterprise failure or a significant and/or unacceptable level of degradation of operations that could only be recovered with significant time and resources.
- **Moderate:** The product, service, or supplier’s failure to perform as designed would result in serious enterprise failure that could be readily and quickly managed with no long-term consequences.
- **Low:** The product, service, or supplier’s failure to perform as designed would result in few adverse effects on the enterprise, and those effects could be readily and quickly managed with no long-term consequences.

**Information Gathering:**
- C-SCRM PMOs and requestors should coordinate the collection of information related to the enterprise’s critical functions and components, the identification of the intended user environment for the product or service, and supplier information.

### Risk Response Analysis

**Definition:**
- The C-SCRA risk exposure reflects a combined judgment based on likelihood and impact analyses. The likelihood analysis is scored via a combination of the aforementioned threat and vulnerability analysis scores.

**Likelihood Levels:**
- **Very Likely:** Critical threat and vulnerability.
- **Highly Likely:** High threat and vulnerability.
- **Moderately Likely:** Moderate threat and vulnerability.
- **Unlikely:** Low threat and vulnerability.

**Risk Exposure:**
- The C-SCRA risk exposure is then aggregated based on the likelihood score and the impact score. If multiple vulnerabilities are identified for a given product or service, each vulnerability shall be assigned a risk level based on its likelihood and impact.

**Risk Levels:**
- **Critical:** Very likely likelihood and critical impact.
- **High:** Highly likely likelihood and high impact.
- **Moderate:** Moderately likely likelihood and moderate impact.
- **Low:** Unlikely likelihood and low impact.

**Decision Making:**
- The risk analyses and scoring provide measures by which the enterprise determines whether or not to proceed with procurement of the product, service, or supplier. Decisions to proceed must be weighed against the risk appetite and tolerance across the tiers of the enterprise, as well as the mitigation strategy that may be put in place to manage the risks as a result of procuring the product, service, or supplier.

### Roles and Responsibilities

- **C-SCRM PMO:**
  - Maintain C-SCRA policies, procedures, and scoring methodologies.
  - Perform C-SCRA standard operating procedures.
  - Liaise with requestors seeking to procure a product, service, or supplier.
  - Report C-SCRA results to leadership to help inform enterprise risk posture.

- **Requestor:**
  - Complete C-SCRA request forms and provide all required information.
  - Address any information follow-up requests from the C-SCRM PMO resource completing the C-SCRA.
  - Adhere to any stipulations or mitigations mandated by the C-SCRM PMO following approval of a C-SCRA request.

### Definitions

- **Procurement:** The process of obtaining a system, product, or service.

### Revision and Maintenance

- **Frequency of Updates:**
  - The enterprise’s C-SCRA template must be reviewed on an annual basis, at a minimum, since changes to laws, policies, standards, guidelines, and controls are dynamic and evolving.

- **Criteria for Interim Revisions:**
  - A change of policies that impact the C-SCRA template.
  - Significant C-SCRM events.
  - The introduction of new technologies.
  - The discovery of new vulnerabilities.
  - Operational or environmental changes.
  - Shortcomings in the C-SCRA template.
  - A change of scope.
  - Other enterprise-specific criteria.

This structured format ensures clarity, coherence, and professionalism, making it easier to understand and follow.
