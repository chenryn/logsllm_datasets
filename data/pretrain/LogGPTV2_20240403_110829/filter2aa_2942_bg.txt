4.1.4. Threat Analysis 
Define threat analysis as well as the criteria that will be utilized to assess the threat of the 
product, service, or supplier. Include a rubric with categorical definitions to encourage the 
transparency of assessment results. 
Sample Text 
The C-SCRA threat analysis evaluates and characterizes the level of threat to the integrity, 
trustworthiness, and authenticity of the product, service, or supplier as described below.  
This analysis is based on a threat actor’s capability and intent to compromise or exploit the 
product, service, or supplier being introduced into the supply chain. Following completion of the 
analysis, one of the following threat levels is assigned:  
• Critical: Information indicates that an adversarial or non-adversarial threat is imminent 
(e.g., an adversary is actively engaged in subversion, exploitation, or sabotage of the 
product, service, or supplier).  
• High: Information indicates that an adversarial or non-adversarial threat is imminent  
(e.g., significant drought in the geographical area combined with location characteristics 
of the asset yields high potential for forest fires).

PRACTICES FOR SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS 
228 
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1 
• Moderate: Information indicates that an adversarial or non-adversarial threat has an 
average potential to impact or target the enterprise (e.g., a specific adversarial threat 
exists but lacks either the capability or the intent to engage in subversion, exploitation or 
sabotage of the product, service, or supplier). 
• Low: Information indicates that adversarial or non-adversarial threats are non-existent, 
unlikely, or have below average potential to impact or target the enterprise (e.g., 
adversarial threats lack both the capability and the intent to engage in subversion, 
exploitation, or sabotage of the product, service, or supplier).  
To appropriately assign the above threat analysis designation, C-SCRM PMOs and requestors 
should leverage the Information Gathering and Scoping questionnaire to coordinate the 
collection of information related to the product, service, or supplier’s operational details, 
ownership structure, key management personnel, financial information, business ventures, 
government restrictions, and potential threats. Additional investigations of the aforementioned 
topics should be performed if red flags are observed during initial data collection. 
4.1.5. Vulnerability Analysis 
Define vulnerability analysis and the criteria that will be utilized to assess the vulnerability of 
the product, service, or supplier being assessed. Include a rubric with categorical definitions to 
encourage transparency behind assessment results. 
Sample Text 
The C-SCRA vulnerability analysis evaluates and then characterizes the vulnerability of the 
product, service, or supplier throughout its life cycle and/or engagement. The analysis includes 
an assessment of the ease of exploitation by a threat actor with moderate capabilities. This 
analysis is based on a threat actor’s capability and intent to compromise or exploit the product, 
service, or supplier being introduced into the supply chain. Following completion of the analysis, 
one of the following threat levels is assigned:  
• Critical: The product, service, or supplier contains vulnerabilities or weaknesses that are 
wholly exposed and easily exploitable.   
• High: The product, service, or supplier contains vulnerabilities or weaknesses that are 
highly exposed and reasonably exploitable.  
• Moderate: The product, service, or supplier contains vulnerabilities or weaknesses that 
are moderately exposed and difficult to exploit.  
• Low: The product, service, or supplier contains vulnerabilities and weaknesses with 
limited exposure and are unlikely to be exploited. 
To appropriately assign the above vulnerability analysis designation, C-SCRM PMOs and 
requestors should coordinate the collection of information related to the product, service, or 
supplier’s operational details, exploitability, service details, attributes of known vulnerabilities, 
and mitigation techniques.

4.1.6. Impact Analysis 
Define impact analysis and the criteria that will be utilized to assess the criticality of the 
product, service, or supplier being assessed. Include a rubric with categorical definitions to 
encourage the transparency of assessment results. 
Sample Text 
The C-SCRA impact analysis evaluates and then characterizes the impact of the product, service, 
or supplier throughout its life cycle and/or engagement. The analysis includes an end-to-end 
functional review to identify critical functions and components based on an assessment of the 
potential harm caused by the probable loss, damage, or compromise of a product, material, or 
service to an enterprise’s operations or mission. Upon completion of the analysis, one of the 
following impact levels is assigned:  
• Critical: The product, service, or supplier’s failure to perform as designed would result 
in a total enterprise failure or a significant and/or unacceptable level of degradation of 
operations that could only be recovered with exceptional time and resources. 
• High: The product, service, or supplier’s failure to perform as designed would result in 
severe enterprise failure or a significant and/or unacceptable level of degradation of 
operations that could only be recovered with significant time and resources. 
• Moderate: The product, service, or supplier’s failure to perform as designed would result 
in serious enterprise failure that could be readily and quickly managed with no long-term 
consequences. 
• Low: The product, service, or supplier’s failure to perform as designed would result in 
few adverse effects on the enterprise, and those effects could be readily and quickly 
managed with no long-term consequences. 
To appropriately assign the above impact analysis designation, C-SCRM PMOs and requestors 
should coordinate the collection of information related to the enterprise’s critical functions and 
components, the identification of the intended user environment for the product or service, and 
supplier information. 
4.1.7. Risk Response Analysis 
Define risk analysis and the criteria that will be utilized to assess the scoring of the product or 
service being assessed. Include a rubric with categorical definitions to encourage the 
transparency of assessment results. 
Sample Text 
The C-SCRA risk exposure reflects a combined judgement based on likelihood and impact 
analyses. The likelihood analysis is scored via a combination of the aforementioned threat and 
vulnerability analysis score, as outlined in the figure below.

Fig. D-3: Example Risk Exposure Determination 
The aforementioned risk analyses and scoring provide measures by which the enterprise 
determines whether or not to proceed with procurement of the product, service, or supplier. 
Decisions to proceed must be weighed against the risk appetite and tolerance across the tiers of 
the enterprise, as well as the mitigation strategy that may be put in place to manage the risks as a 
result of procuring the product, service, or supplier.

4.1.8. Roles and Responsibilities 
State those responsible for the C-SCRA policies, as well as its key contributors. Include the role 
and name of each individual or group, as well contact information where necessary (e.g., 
enterprise affiliation, address, email address, and phone number). 
Sample Text 
• The C-SCRM PMO shall: 
o Maintain C-SCRA policies, procedures, and scoring methodologies;  
o Perform C-SCRA standard operating procedures;  
o Liaise with requestors seeking to procure a product, service, or supplier; and  
o Report C-SCRA results to leadership to help inform enterprise risk posture.

o Complete C-SCRA request forms and provide all required information,  
o Address any information follow-up requests from the C-SCRM PMO resource 
completing the C-SCRA, and  
o Adhere to any stipulations or mitigations mandated by the C-SCRM PMO 
following approval of a C-SCRA request.  
4.1.9. Definitions 
List the key definitions described within the policy, and provide enterprise-specific context and 
examples where needed. 
Sample Text 
• Procurement: The process of obtaining a system, product, or service. 
4.1.10. Revision and Maintenance 
Define the required frequency for updating the C-SCRA template. Maintain a table of revisions 
to enforce version control. C-SCRA templates are living documents that must be updated and 
communicated to all appropriate individuals (e.g., staff, contractors, and suppliers). 
Sample Text 
The enterprise’s C-SCRA template must be reviewed on an annual basis, at a minimum, since 
changes to laws, policies, standards, guidelines, and controls are dynamic and evolving. 
Additional criteria that may trigger interim revisions include: 
• A change of policies that impact the C-SCRA template, 
• Significant C-SCRM events, 
• The introduction of new technologies, 
• The discovery of new vulnerabilities, 
• Operational or environmental changes,
