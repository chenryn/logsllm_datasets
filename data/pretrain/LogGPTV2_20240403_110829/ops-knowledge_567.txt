User: My program has been written on python 3.1 (it was the biggest mistake I've ever made). Now I want to use a few modules that were written on 2.6.
I know that it's possible to specify the interpreter in Unix #!/usr/bin/python2.6. But what if I use Windows? Does any way to specify the interpreter exist in Windows?
Edit: I want to be able to use both interpreters simultaneously.
Assistant: Maybe "Open with..." + 'Remember my choice' in context menu of explorer?
