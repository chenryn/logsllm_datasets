ABSTRACT
File sharing using peer-to-peer (p2p) systems is a major Internet ap-
plication and the leading source of network trafﬁc today. However,
the dominance of p2p systems for ﬁle sharing has been recently
challenged by an increasing number of services, such as Rapid-
Share and MegaUpload, which offer users the ability to share ﬁles
through centralized servers, without relying on an underlying p2p
infrastructure. These services, referred to as One-Click Hosting
(OCH), have the potential to offer users better performance and
availability than p2p systems. If they succeed, OCH services may
become the leading platform for ﬁle sharing and eventually replace
p2p systems for this purpose. In this paper, we present the ﬁrst, to
our knowledge, detailed study of OCH trafﬁc and services focusing
on the most popular such service: RapidShare. Through a combina-
tion of passive and active measurements, we attempt to understand
their service architecture, usage patterns, and content characteris-
tics. We also compare RapidShare with BitTorrent in terms of user-
perceived throughput and content availability, and we explore the
characteristics of some popular RapidShare indexing sites.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, ﬁle sharing has become one of the most
popular Internet user activities, surpassing in terms of trafﬁc vol-
ume email, ftp, and even the mighty World Wide Web. Indeed, ﬁle

sharing accounts for the largest portion of network trafﬁc, reach-
ing as high as 60-70% of the total volume in some ISPs [15]. This
popularity of ﬁle sharing was fueled by the evolution of the p2p
paradigm, which enabled users to exchange ﬁles without having to
rely on a third-party server infrastructure.
In the last couple of years, however, a new type of ﬁle shar-
ing service has emerged, usually referred to as One-Click Hosting
(OCH). OCH sites, such as RapidShare, MegaUpload or FileFac-
tory, allow users to share ﬁles through dedicated server infrastruc-
tures. Using OCH services, a user can share a large ﬁle (even gi-
gabytes) with one or more other users in a sequence of few simple
steps: (i) The user uploads the (potentially encrypted) ﬁle on an
OCH server through a basic Web interface. (ii) The OCH service
provides the uploader with a URL for the ﬁle. (iii) The uploader
shares that URL (and a decryption key, if necessary) with other
users either privately (e.g. email) or through public indexing sites,
such as rslinks.com, blogs, personal Web pages, etc. (iv) For pub-
licly indexed content, users can ﬁnd the download-URL through
search engines, and they can then download the ﬁle through a basic
Web interface. Usually, OCH services offer both Free and Premium
(i.e. paying) accounts as well as several incentives (discussed later)
for attracting users to upload content (making the service more
valuable) and to subscribe as Premium users.
Compared to p2p applications, OCH services could provide sev-
eral advantages for ﬁle sharing:
• Availability: Files uploaded on OCH services are available
24/7 - not only when a “seeder” is available as is the case
with p2p systems.
• Anonymity: In the p2p paradigm, peers have to disclose
their IP addresses to the community when they are down-
loading (or uploading) a ﬁle. Thus, someone can inﬁltrate
a p2p system and harvest IP addresses of hosts that engage
in ﬁle sharing. On the contrary, in OCH services the IP ad-
dresses (and in some cases the identity) of the uploaders and
downloaders are known only to the OCH service. Unless the
OCH service cooperates, it would be difﬁcult for someone to
harvest IP addresses of computers that engage in ﬁle sharing
through OCH sites.
• Performance: Because of their business model and always-
on infrastructure, OCH services aim at offering high through-
put, at least to their Premium users. Indeed, our experiments
in Section 7.1 show that a Premium RapidShare user receives
an order of magnitude higher throughput than a BitTorrent
user downloading the same ﬁle.
• Content Availability: As we show in Section 7.2, even though
a user can ﬁnd popular content in both OCH and p2p ser-
223vices, less popular/known content can be found more fre-
quently at OCH services.
• Incentives: OCH services allow frequent uploaders to re-
ceive a higher download throughput, providing the incentive
to upload more ﬁles, thus making OCH services richer in
content.
In this paper, we study the OCH paradigm from multiple per-
spectives, focusing on RapidShare, the most popular (at least in
terms of trafﬁc) OCH service today [15]. Through a combination
of passive and active measurements, we analyze trafﬁc character-
istics, usage patterns, and especially, we explore their service in
terms of location, multihoming, load balancing, ﬁle allocation pol-
icy, etc. Further, we compare RapidShare and BitTorrent in terms
of user-perceived performance and content availability. Finally, we
look at the major OCH indexing web sites, aiming to characterize
the type of content users share and whether that content is copy-
righted.
The contributions of this paper are:
1. We provide the ﬁrst to our knowledge study of OCH services
focusing on their client, server, trafﬁc, content and perfor-
mance characteristics. This study improves our understand-
ing of OCH services and it allows a comparison with other
similar services, such as Web Content Distribution Networks
(CDN).
2. Using passive network monitoring, we measure the volume
of OCH trafﬁc and show that it surpasses (or it is compara-
ble to) the trafﬁc volume of popular video services such as
YouTube and GoogleVideo.
3. We show that most ﬁles are requested only once in our client-
side traces (collected at two academic networks) - very few
ﬁles were requested more than ﬁve times during our 5-month
long traces. This suggests that caching, often used in CDNs,
may not be effective in OCH services.
4. We explore the number of users that upload content, based on
indexing sites, and show that it is only a handful of users that
provide most OCH content, making the entire system quite
sensitive to minor changes in the number and “productivity”
of uploaders.
5. By using the Tor anonymity network as a large geographi-
cally distributed client base, we develop a methodology to
infer the server location, content replication approach and
load balancing that RapidShare uses.
6. We compare the relative beneﬁts of OCH and p2p ﬁle sharing
systems using RapidShare and BitTorrent, in terms of per-
formance and content availability. We show that RapidShare
provides signiﬁcant beneﬁts in these two aspects.
7. Our analysis of few public indexing sites shows that users of-
ten rely on OCH services to share movies, songs, games, and
software, and that in most cases this content is protected by
copyright legal constraints making such ﬁle sharing illegal.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We introduce OCH
services in Section 2 and describe our datasets in Section 3. Based
on the collected data, we provide a characterization of OCH trafﬁc
during our monitoring period in Section 4, and a characterization
of OCH clients in Section 5. We attempt to infer the architecture of
RapidShare (the leading OCH service) in Section 6. We compare

user experience between RapidShare and BitTorrent (the leading
p2p system) in Section 7. Section 8 explores the characteristics
of some popular OCH indexing services. Finally, we place our
work in the appropriate context by presenting the related work in
Section 9 and we conclude the paper with a summary of our main
ﬁndings in Section 10.
2. ONE-CLICK HOSTING SERVICES
Since early 2005 several OCH sites made their appearance, in-
cluding megaupload.com, rapidshare.com, filefactory.
com, and others. These sites facilitated the creation of a vibrant
user community that shares ﬁles reliably and inexpensively. OCH
services can be described as Web services that allow a user to up-
load and store ﬁles on dedicated, always-on servers, and then share
those ﬁles with other users through a URL (see Figure 1). The
whole process is usually offered for free and needs a small number
of steps for both uploading and downloading ﬁles. OCH services
do not offer indexing or search capabilities, and search engines can-
not crawl the download URLs. What happens, however, is that
there are other “indexing” Web sites, such as EgyDown.com or
RapidShareIndex.com, in which upload users can post OCH
URLs for the ﬁles they want to share. Those indexing sites are
often publicly visible and crawled by search engines.
In this paper we focus on the largest and most popular OCH ser-
vice: RapidShare. RapidShare was launched in October 2006, and
within two years it grew to 2.5 million users.1 In our client-side
trafﬁc traces (§ 3), RapidShare is responsible for more than 50%
(on average) and up to 95% of the total trafﬁc exchanged through
OCH Services. 2
The main page of RapidShare offers a basic Web interface con-
taining just the necessary ﬁelds to upload a ﬁle. Once a ﬁle has
been uploaded, RapidShare provides the user with two URLs: the
“download URL” that is to be shared with other users who want
to access the ﬁle, and the “remove URL” to request deletion of that
ﬁle. To create a viable business model, RapidShare offers two types
of service: “Free” and “Premium”. Premium users can enjoy un-
limited use of RapidShare resources: their upload and download
bandwidth is not throttled, they can start several concurrent down-
loads, upload ﬁles as large as 2GB, etc. On the other hand, Free
