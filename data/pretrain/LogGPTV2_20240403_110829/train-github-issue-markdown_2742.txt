In settings, on the "Themes" tab, when I type anything into the box labelled
"Filter themes by name," all themes are filtered _out_ , even if I type in
strings that appear within the names of themes I've installed, and even if I
type in the exact name of the theme.
For example, suppose I was trying to quickly get to "seti-ui." If I type in
`seti`, nothing appears. If I type in `seti-ui`, nothing appears. As far as I
can tell, the filter box filters out every theme, no matter what you type into
it.
