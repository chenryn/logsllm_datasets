Question: A web application uses form-based authentication and session management that relies on client-side cookies for maintaining user sessions. An attacker aims to exploit a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in this application by crafting a malicious HTML page. Which of the following scenarios is most likely to result in a successful CSRF attack?
"A": "The attacker convinces a logged-in user to visit an HTML page with an embedded `img` tag pointing to a sensitive action on the target application.",
"B": "The attacker sends an email with a link that, when clicked by the user, triggers a download of a PDF file containing the attack code.",
"C": "The web application uses HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads for browser to server communication, requiring the attacker to craft a self-submitting form with a JSON payload and the correct `enctype`.",
"D": "The application implements server-side CSRF tokens, and the attacker tries to circumvent this by including the correct token value in their malicious HTML page."
