Should it be possible to define a network in stax without setting a non-batch
dimension?
    import jax.numpy as np
    from jax import random
    from jax.experimental import stax
    from jax.experimental.stax import Dense, Relu, Flatten, LogSoftmax
    # Use stax to set up network initialization and evaluation functions
    net_init, net_apply = stax.serial(Dense(128), Relu, Dense(10), LogSoftmax)
    rng = random.PRNGKey(0)
    # Initialize parameters, not committing to a batch shape
    # works
    in_shape = (-1, 1)
    out_shape, net_params = net_init(rng, in_shape)
    # doesn't work (fails with ValueError: all elements of broadcast shape must be non-negative)
    in_shape = (-1,)
    out_shape, net_params = net_init(rng, in_shape)
As a workaround, I can of course add a fake 1 dimension on the end, and then
remove it later, but I was a little surprised that this doesn't automatically
work.
