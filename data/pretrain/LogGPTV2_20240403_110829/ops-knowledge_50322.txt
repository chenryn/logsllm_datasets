User: I would like to find out if Twisted imposes restriction on maximum size of UDP packets. The allowable limit on linux platforms is upto 64k (although I intend to send packets of about 10k bytes consisting of JPEG images) but I am not able to send more than approx. 2500 bytes
Assistant: It's very unlikely that Twisted is imposing any limit but there's no reason some other part of the network wouldn't drop the packets if they're too large. It's very rare for people to send UDP packets of such a large size for precisely that sort of reason. Most game applications for example try to keep them below 1.5K these days, and below 512 bytes in the not-too-distant past.
