Figure 7 and 9 summarize the comprehensibility of the corpus.
Figure 10 summarizes the mean Cloze scores across spe-
ciﬁc advice providers who are members of the U.S. Govern-
ment, non-tech non-proﬁts, and technical non-proﬁts.

({SOUPS} 2016), pages 175–188, 2016.
The questions for this section of the survey are about the
following advice: You should create a new email address
if your last one is compromised. An example of this advice
might be: “Time for a new email address. This is the last resort
but it will be 100% eﬀective at giving you a clean slate.”
