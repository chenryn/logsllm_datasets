### RTP Media Stream Header Initialization
The converted RTP media stream headers are initialized with the following parameters:
- Original RTP stream’s SSRC
- Payload Type
- Incremented sequence and timestamp values
- Spoofed source IP and UDP port of a valid video sender

### VideoJak Overview
#### Targeting an H.234 RTP Video Stream
- **Select the 1-way video stream**
- **Start the attack by dropping the valid RTP packets**

#### Video DoS Exploit
- **Select the AVI or H.264 raw file**
- **Use Libnet to construct the H.264 RTP packet**
- **Use the SSRC, timestamp, and other values from the dropped packet**
- **Video interception can be a replay or a random movie clip**
- **Target the video device and send the AVI file to the destination RTP port**

### VideoJak Target
#### Cisco 4300 Series IP Camera
- **Part of Cisco’s “Physical Security” solutions portfolio**
- **Supports 1080p High Definition (HD) Video**
- **Uses RTP to stream H.264 compressed frames**
- **Uses RTSP for port negotiation**
- **Supports security features such as SRTP and 802.1x**
- **Equipped with 10/100 FE with PoE, or wireless connectivity**
- **Includes a web application (ActiveX control) for remote viewing from a PC**
- **Video Analytics: 4500 series supports DSP-based, programmable analytics**

**Purchased from a Cisco reseller specializing in video surveillance:**
- **EYESthere** (http://www.eyestheredfw.com)

For this demonstration, we will target the unidirectional RTP stream from the IP camera to our demo laptop.

### The Ultimate UCSniff Trick
This is the ultimate stealth UCSniff trick that allows you to eavesdrop on a targeted user with minimal risk of service impact.
- **So smooth and stealthy, even a ninja would be impressed**

#### Finding the IP Address of a Remote IP Phone
To clandestinely find the IP address of a remote IP Phone:
1. **Share a hub with your laptop and the IP Phone**
2 - **Sniff traffic using Wireshark**
3. **Call the remote user (via corporate directory or Intranet)**
4. **Ensure the remote called party picks up the call (the remote phone must go off-hook)**
5. **Decode RTP packets to find the remote IP address**
6. **Use Wireshark's RTP filter to identify the IP address**

#### Creating the Targets Entry
- **Manually create a file named `targets.txt`**
- **Include the IP address of the discovered remote IP Phone target**

#### Running UCSniff in Targeted User Mode
- **Run UCSniff with the command: `ucsniff –i eth0 –c 1 –T`**
- **Select Option 1 for Single User Mode**

#### Selecting the Targeted User
- **Choose the targeted user**

#### Stealth Mode Targeted Eavesdropping
- **UCSniff now intercepts traffic only from the targeted user’s IP Phone**
- **All calls to or from this user will be recorded**
- **Low risk of impact**
- **Will not affect other IP Phone users**

### Background of a Live UC Penetration Test
- **VIPER Security Consultant onsite with a client in Europe**
- **Authorized penetration test against a Cisco UCM 7.1 VoIP environment**
- **GARP was disabled by default on all Cisco Unified IP Phones**
- **For IP Phones calling each other in the same VLAN, RTP media could be reconstructed using the `–garpdb` feature of ucsniff**
- **For IP Phones calling to remote VLANs, only ingress traffic could be reconstructed due to GARP being disabled**
- **Skinny keypad messages for voice mail password theft could not be intercepted**

#### Overcoming the "GARP Disabled" Feature
- **We needed to remotely enable GARP on the IP Phone**
- **GARP is managed via the server, which specifies the configuration for the IP Phone**
- **Cisco Unified IP Phones download the configuration file via TFTP during boot-up and registration via Skinny/SCCP protocol**
- **We developed a new feature in UCSniff to force the IP Phone to download and modify the configuration file, enabling GARP**

#### Preparing UCSniff
- **Gain physical access to a port that is a member of the Voice VLAN for the IP Phone**
- **Know the IP address of the IP Phone**
- **Create the `targets.txt` file with the IP address of the IP Phone**

#### Launching UCSniff with the New Feature
- **Launch UCSniff with the command: `ucsniff –i eth0 –Z –G –T`**
- **This can only run in Target Mode, against a single IP Phone**

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Drop the KeepAliveAckMessage**: 
   - **Cisco SCCP IP Phones use a KeepAlive/KeepAliveAckMessage as a heartbeat mechanism**
   - **UCSniff drops the KeepAliveAck Message, making the IP Phone believe it has lost connectivity to the server**
2. **IP Phone Registers and Downloads Configuration File**:
   - **The IP Phone attempts to register and downloads the configuration file via TFTP**
   - **UCSniff intercepts the TFTP file and looks for the GARP setting within the UDP stream**
3. **Modify the Configuration Setting for GARP**:
   - **Change the GARP setting from "GARP Disabled" to "GARP Enabled"**
4. **IP Phone Parses the New Configuration**:
   - **The IP Phone finishes downloading the configuration file and enables GARP**

#### Summary
- **The process takes less than 30 seconds**
- **The IP Phone will keep the settings until it is rebooted**
- **The IP Phone may blank out for about 20 seconds when it loses registration**
- **Pentest Trick**: 
  - **Wait until employees leave for the day**
  - **Target each IP Phone, enabling GARP**
  - **When employees return the next morning, they can be targeted for VoIP/Voicemail eavesdropping**

#### Additional Information
- **We can modify any IP Phone setting controlled by the SEP Configuration file**
- **UCSniff 3.0 includes this new feature**
- **Mitigation**: Follow Cisco Security Best Practices (See the Cisco SAFE Architecture: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns954/index.html)
