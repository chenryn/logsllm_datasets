I found a bug that surfaced in Spring 3.0.1. The problem is with binding a
value to a map with the form select tag.
In my JSP I have the following select tag. This will bind to a Map field in my command object.
If I do a view source I can clearly see the problem.
In Spring 3.0 I have this:
CherryWalnut
In Spring 3.0.1 I have this:
CherryWalnut
Notice how the name is "questionsARTISAN_ARMOIRE_WOOD" instead of
"questions[ARTISAN_ARMOIRE_WOOD]". The brackets got dropped in 3.0.1.
