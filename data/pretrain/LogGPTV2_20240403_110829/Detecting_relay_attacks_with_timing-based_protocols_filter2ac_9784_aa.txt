Abstract. Distance bounding protocols have been proposed as means
of detecting relay attacks, also known as maﬁa fraud. In this paper we
present the ﬁrst symmetric key based distance bounding protocol that
is also resistant to so-called terrorist fraud, a variant of maﬁa fraud. Re-
lay attacks present a serious threat to RF security devices (contactless
smart cards, RFID tags and the like) because they undermine the im-
plicit assumption that the device is physically close to the reader when it
is operating. In applications such as physical access control this assump-
tion of physical proximity is all-important. Distance bounding protocols
require a communication channel that can exchange single bits with ex-
tremely low latency. This unconventional communication requirement
has prompted Hancke and Kuhn to assert in a recent publication [12]
that ultra wide band (UWB) radio is necessary to achieve a useful dis-
tance bounding resolution. We analyse this assertion and present a al-
ternative, novel communication approach that leverages the phenomena
of side channel leakage to deliver a low latency channel. Our proposal is
capable of detecting sophisticated relay attacks without resorting to the
considerable expense and complexity of UWB radio. We present experi-
mental results to support our arguments.
1 Introduction
Recent publications [15, 11] have highlighted the vulnerability of RF transpon-
ders to relay attacks by presenting practical, low cost attacks on ISO 14443
contactless smart cards. The relay attack is particularly insidious because it
works without the need to circumvent any cryptographic security protocols that
may be in place. ISO 14443 cards have a short operating range of 10 cm from
the card reader [1]. There is an implicit assumption that if a reader is commu-
nicating with a card, that card is actually within 10 cm of the reader. However
this assumption may not be well founded because an attacker can simply relay
the RF messages from the reader to a legitimate card that is far away and relay
the card’s responses back to the reader.
Distance bounding protocols have been proposed as a means of protecting
against relay attacks. A distance-bounding protocol is an authentication protocol
2
between a prover A and a veriﬁer B, whereby B obtains corroborating evidence
about A’s claimed identity and physical proximity at the time the protocol is
run. Distance-bounding protocols can be thought of as traditional identiﬁcation
protocols enhanced with a distance-bounding mechanism. The former provides
assurance as to the identity of the prover, while the latter allows the veriﬁer to
upper bound the distance which separates her from the prover. This dichotomy
of distance-bounding protocols into an identiﬁcation mechanism and a distance-
bounding mechanism is readily seen in most proposals, which can be easily de-
composed into an identiﬁcation part, matching some known identiﬁcation proto-
col, and a distance-bounding part, consisting of multiple fast challenge-response
rounds. The distance between prover and veriﬁer is upper-bounded by measuring
the time intervals between challenges being sent and responses being received.

Fig. 1. Adversarial setting
The ﬁrst distance-bounding protocol was proposed by Brands and Chaum [4]
to thwart maﬁa fraud - the name for relay attacks against identiﬁcation proto-
cols ﬁrst described by Desmedt [8]. In a maﬁa fraud, the adversary consists of
two parts: a rogue prover ¯A and a rogue veriﬁer ¯B, sitting in between the real
veriﬁer B and prover A as shown in Figure 1. ¯A and ¯B simply relay the pro-
tocol messages between A and B. Hence what the adversary achieves is to fool
B into thinking that he is directly communicating with A, when in reality he is
talking to ¯A. This attack does not violate the traditional security requirements
of identiﬁcation protocols, however it may be a concern if the veriﬁer incorrectly
makes assumptions as to the proximity of the prover. For example, consider the
case where B is an RF reader enforcing access control through a door and A
uses a RF proximity card to authenticate to B. A succesful maﬁa fraud attack
would allow an adversary to open the door when A is sitting at a restaurant
close by to ¯B who is stealthily running the identiﬁcation protocol with A’s card
and relaying all the information to ¯A, who is present near the door running
the identiﬁcation protocol with B using the messages received from her accom-
plice. Brands and Chaum [4] described two protocols secure against maﬁa fraud
attacks. The underlying identiﬁcation protocols are a signature based challenge-
response mechanism for one of them, and a zero-knowledge identiﬁcation proto-
col for the other. These protocols use public key cryptographic operations, which
are computationally demanding for highly resource constrained devices such as
RFID tags.
1.1 Contribution and overview
The paper is presented in two parts, the ﬁrst dealing with protocol speciﬁcs and
the second with implementation. Recently, Hancke and Kuhn [12] proposed a
3
very eﬃcient distance-bounding protocol which is secure against maﬁa fraud. In
Section 2 we review their protocol and explain why it is not resistant to terrorist
fraud. In Section 3 we propose the ﬁrst symmetric key based distance-bounding
protocol which is resistant to terrorist fraud and is computationally eﬃcient
enough to be implemented in resource constrained devices.
Hancke and Kuhn [12] have proposed the use of ultra wide band radio (UWB)
to meet the demanding communications requirements of their distance bounding
protocol. The addition of UWB would add appreciable cost and complexity to
contactless smart card integrated circuits, so it could only be justiﬁed in the
absence of simpler, lower cost alternatives. In Section 4 we present an analysis
of the communication channel requirements for distance bounding. This analysis
highlights the importance of low communication latency, which is not purely a
function of the channel bit rate. We propose a novel communication method
based on the principle of side channel leakage, that has very low latency. In
Section 5 we report on our current investigations into adapting the existing load
modulation circuitry in proximity cards to our proposed communication tech-
nique. We present experimental results indicating that a modiﬁed load modula-
tion scheme can provide suﬃcient timing resolution to detect sophisticated relay
attacks launched by well funded attackers. Our proposed approach avoids the
additional cost and complexity of adopting UWB radio.

The following notation is used in the rest of the paper.
– We use ← to indicate assigment to a variable. If A is a set the x ← A assigns
– {0, 1}n denotes the set of all strings of bit-length n.
– Given a string s, we use si to denote the ith less signiﬁcant bit of s;
– ID U is the identity string corresponding to user U.
– time() is a function implemented at all parties that returns the internal clock
time. To measure the time between two events we use two instructions, Start
clock and Stop clock, such that Start clock ∆t assigns to = time() and
Stop clock ∆t, assigns tf = time() and ∆t = tf − to. Note that we do not
require clocks at diﬀerent parties to be synchronised.
2 Hancke and Kuhn’s distance bounding protocol
Hancke and Kuhn’s [12] distance-bounding protocol is highly eﬃcient. The pro-
tocol (see Figure 1) is based on a symmetric-key identiﬁcation mechanism, where
the prover and veriﬁer share a common secret value s. The distance is param-
etised by the maximum challenge-response delay allowed, ∆tmax. The protocol
starts by having A and B exchange random nonces rA and rB. The prover then
applies a keyed hash function1 h to the concatenation of the nonces rAkrB to get
1 Hancke and Kuhn [12] speciﬁcally require that this function be one-way and collision
resistance. We notice however that this is clearly insuﬃcient and that h should be
pseudo-random. Otherwise, if not all the bits in d are pseudo-random, an adversary
will have an advantage in responding to a proportion of the challenges. Also note
that pseudo-randomness implies collision resistance and one-wayness.

d. The prover splits d into two n-bit strings l and r. A fast n-round challenge-
response phase begins then. At each round, B sends challenge bit αi, to which
A must respond with the ith bit of l if βi = 0, and the ith bit of r if βi = 1.
The veriﬁer checks that the received response is correct. (He can do so, since
he can also compute l and r.) Additionally, B measures the time ∆ti elapsed
between challenge and response. B makes sure that all delays ∆ti are less than
the bound ∆tmax. If all checks are succesful, B outputs accept, otherwise B
outputs reject.

Terrorist fraud Desmedt [8] considered another type of active attacks against
identiﬁcation protocols, which he called terrorist attacks. Here, unlike maﬁa fraud
attacks where the prover is oblivious to the attack that is underway, the prover
conspires with ¯A and ¯B to intentionally try to fool the veriﬁer as to A’s location.
Defending against terrorist attacks is more diﬃcult, since A’s secret information
2 A better bound can be obtained when we know the time ∆tp that it takes for A to
process a challege. In this case, the distance is bounded by c(∆tmax − ∆tp)/2.
5
(e.g. authentication keys) may be used in a manner which is diﬀererent to what
the protocol prescribes. Clearly, if A is prepared to released her secret authen-
tication keys to ¯A, then the attack is trivially successful. When dealing with
terrorist attacks, we preoccupied ourselves with attacks where the prover does
not reveal to her accomplices secret information that will allow the accomplices
to impersonate A in more than a single run of the protocol. In particular, A does
not reveal her long term private key.
Protocol 1 is not secure against terrorist fraud attacks. A remote A can
always relay r and l to a rogue prover ¯A who is close by to B. Note that the
time-critical phase does not start until B sends the ﬁrst challenge bit, and that
releasing r and l does not compromise the long-term secret s.
To the best of our knowledge, the only distance-bounding protocol that pro-
tects against terrorist fraud attacks is the protocol of Bussard [5]. His solution
is public-key based and uses zero-knowlege techniques, which makes it compu-
tationally expensive, especially for implementation in low-cost RF computing
devices, such as RFID tags. The basic idea of Bussard’s protocol is to force the
prover to give away her private key in order to mount a terrorist attack. The
prover computes c = Ek(sk A), the encryption of her long-term (important) pri-
vate key sk A under a newly generated session key k. The veriﬁer then sends
challenge bits αi to the prover. If αi = 1, the prover must respond with the bit
ci from the ciphertext. If αi = 0, the prover returns the bit ki of the session
key. Thus, in order to successfully and timely reply to the challenges the prover
must be in possesion of c and k, and therefore of sk A. This is better illustrated
in Section 3, where we apply the same basic idea to Protocol 1.
Distance Fraud Finally, there is one more attack against distance-bounding
protocols that must be considered, and which Bussard [5] refers to as distance
fraud. In this type of attack the prover on her own tries to subvert the security
of the protocol by having the veriﬁer believe she is close by, when in fact she is
not. This is the simplest attack that distance-bounding protocols should defend
against. Note that terrorist fraud resistance implies distance fraud resistance.
3 New distance-bounding protocol
As indicated in Section 2, Bussard’s protocol [5] protects against terrorist fraud
attacks, but its use of asymmetric techniques makes it computationally demand-
ing. On the other hand, the more computationally eﬃcient protocols published,
based on symmetric key authentication, do not aﬀord terrorist fraud resistance.
In this section, we propose the ﬁrst symmetric key based distance-bounding
protocol which is resistant to terrorist fraud attacks and is eﬃcient enough for
implementation in low cost devices. We enhance the protocol of Hancke and
Kuhn [12], which is to our knowledge the most eﬃcient maﬁa-fraud resistant
protocol, by applying the basic idea behind the terrorist fraud resistance of Bus-
sard’s protocol. The result is shown as Protocol 2. The eﬃciency of the new
protocol remains practically unchanged with respect to Hancke and Kuhn’s [12],
6
the main diﬀerence being the addition of a symmetric encryption (in practice,
an xor operation as discussed below).
