Abstract
This paper presents a novel technique for authenticating
physical documents based on random, naturally occurring
imperfections in paper texture. We introduce a new method
for measuring the three-dimensional surface of a page
using only a commodity scanner and without modifying
the document in any way. From this physical feature, we
generate a concise ﬁngerprint that uniquely identiﬁes the
document. Our technique is secure against counterfeiting
and robust to harsh handling; it can be used even before
any content is printed on a page. It has a wide range of
applications, including detecting forged currency and tickets,
authenticating passports, and halting counterfeit goods.
Document identiﬁcation could also be applied maliciously to
de-anonymize printed surveys and to compromise the secrecy
of paper ballots.
1. Introduction and Roadmap
Viewed up close, the surface of a sheet of paper is not
perfectly ﬂat but is a tangled mat of wood ﬁbers with a
rich three-dimensional texture that is highly random and
difﬁcult to reproduce. In this study, we introduce a new
method for identifying a physical document—and verifying
its authenticity—by measuring this unique natural structure.
We show that paper texture can be estimated using only
a ﬂatbed scanner coupled with appropriate software, and
that this feature is robust against rough treatment—such as
printing or scribbling on the document or soaking it in water—
and adversarial counterfeiting. Under normal conditions, our
technique can identify documents with near-perfect accuracy
and a negligible false positive rate.
It has long been known how to authenticate the content
printed on a page by using cryptographic methods such as
digital signatures. We address a different problem: how to
authenticate the paper itself. For some kinds of documents,
such as currency and tickets, it matters not only that the
content is unaltered but also that the document is a genuine
original rather than a copy or forgery. Physical document
authentication has many applications, which we discuss

perfectly ﬂat, a scanner will produce a different image
depending on the orientation of the page. The light
reaching the sensor depends on the relative angles of
the light source and surface normal, (a). A 10 mm tall

in Sections 7 and 8. Some of these applications may be
harmful; for example, our method allows re-identiﬁcation of
supposedly anonymous surveys and paper ballots.
In contrast with previous efforts, our technique measures
paper’s 3-D texture, requires no exotic equipment, produces
a concise document ﬁngerprint, does not require modifying
the document, and may be applied to blank paper before
content is printed. Previous systems lack one or more of these
properties. For example, Laser Surface Authentication [1]
requires a costly laser microscope to image paper texture,
while the technique proposed by Zhu et al. [2], which focuses
on ink splatter caused by randomness in the printing process,
requires the paper to be printed with known content prior to
ﬁngerprinting. We discuss these and other related work in
Section 2.
The physical document authentication technique we pro-
pose is a three-stage process culminating in a robust and
secure ﬁngerprint. In the ﬁrst stage, we scan the original
✹papersurfacelightsensornormaldown to glassdocument and estimate its surface texture. Scanners normally
measure only the color of a document, but by scanning the
paper several times at different orientations, we can estimate
the shape of the surface (see Figure 1). In the second stage,
we condense the surface texture into a concise feature vector,
which robustly identiﬁes the page. The third and ﬁnal stage
uses a secure sketch to generate a ﬁngerprint that reveals little
information about the feature vector. The ﬁngerprint can be
printed on the document (e.g., as a 2-D bar code) or stored
in a database. The veriﬁcation procedure is similar to the
ﬁngerprinting process, with a different ﬁnal stage that veriﬁes
that the generated feature vector is correct. We describe each
of these stages in detail in Section 3.
We designed our technique to satisfy several security and
usability goals:
• Uniqueness Every document should be identiﬁable
and distinguishable from all others.
• Consistency A ﬁngerprint should be veriﬁable by
multiple parties over the lifetime of the document.
• Conciseness Document ﬁngerprints should be short
and easily computable.
• Robustness
It should be possible to verify a ﬁnger-
printed document even if it has been subjected to harsh
treatment.
• Resistance to Forgery It should be very difﬁcult or
costly for an adversary to forge a document by coercing
a second document to express the same ﬁngerprint as
an original.
Sections 4–6 evaluate our system in terms of these goals.

2. Related Work
The Fiberﬁngerprint system of Metois et al. ﬁrst introduced
the notion of using surface texture to uniquely identify a
document [3]. Employing a custom device, Fiberﬁngerprint
measures “inhomogeneities in the substrate” of a document,
from which a unique identiﬁer is derived. The system employs
alignment marks that are added to the document in order
to orient the veriﬁcation system, and requires a specialized
hardware device rather than a commodity scanner.
Laser Surface Authentication is a technique that measures
the texture of a page using a high-powered laser micro-
scope [1]. Creating and verifying ﬁngerprints in their system
requires access to this specialized device, which may be
prohibitively expensive for many users. Their system also
requires that the veriﬁer be online, which may rule out
applications such as third-party ticket veriﬁcation.
A recent patent application by Cowburn and Buchanan de-
scribes using a commodity scanner to identify documents [4].
This method does not measure the normal vector ﬁeld of a
document, but rather uses scans from multiple orientations
in order to extract other additional information. The feature
vector used by Cowburn and Buchanan is not concise, and
their ﬁngerprint is not secure. An adversary with access to
the ﬁngerprint is able to easily discover the surface texture
of the document, possibly making forgery less difﬁcult.
Zhu et al. focus on identifying “non-repeatable randomness
existing in the printing process” [2]. They generate a
ﬁngerprint from the random ink splatter that occurs around
the edges of any features printed on a page. Unlike our
scheme, their method can only be applied after a document
has been printed. Furthermore, their implementation requires
modifying the original document by printing a known target
pattern.
Our method is an improvement over previous work because
we measure the surface texture of a document without the
requirement of expensive equipment. We utilize the unique
ﬁber structure as identiﬁed and relied upon by Metois et al.,
Cowburn and Buchanan, and Zhu et al. but do so without
modifying the document in any way. Our method allows
documents to be ﬁngerprinted before or after content is
printed. In fact, ﬁngerprinting and tracking using our system
can begin during the paper manufacturing process. We have
also developed methods for hiding the target feature vector
through the use of a secure sketch. This means a potential
counterfeiter cannot learn what features he needs to reproduce
from the ﬁngerprint alone but would need access to the
original document to even attempt a forgery.
3. Fingerprinting Process
Our ﬁngerprinting process allows for registration and
validation of a sheet of paper without the participation of a
central registration authority. Depending on the application, a
document’s ﬁngerprint can be stored in a database for future
veriﬁcation, or it can be printed on the document along with
a digital signature, creating a self-verifying original. The
ﬁngerprint can be used to ascertain whether two documents
share the same feature vector without revealing the registered
feature vector itself.
The registration and validation processes are quite similar,
as shown in Figure 2. In the registration process, we scan a
document, estimate its three-dimensional surface texture, and
generate a feature vector V that represents the document’s
unique texture. We consider two documents to be the same
if they have similar feature vectors. To protect the feature
vector and inhibit forgeries that might seek to reproduce
an exact feature vector, the ﬁngerprint contains only a one-
way hash H(V) of the extracted feature vector. To achieve
robustness against measurement errors in the feature vector,
the registration process derives error-correction information
from V and stores it in the ﬁngerprint in the form of a
secure sketch. The ﬁngerprint also contains a random seed
to initialize the pseudorandom number generator used to
compute the feature vector, as described in Section 3.2.

Figure 2. Registration and validation pipelines. Registration: Our method creates a ﬁngerprint that consists of a hash
value, error correction information, and a random seed. Validation: A document is authenticated if a newly computed
hash value is identical to the one stored in the ﬁngerprint. The stored error correction information is used to correct
potentially faulty bits in the feature vector.
The validation process has no access to the original
feature vector. Validating a document requires determining
a document’s feature vector anew, using the seed stored in
the ﬁngerprint. Validation assumes a potentially ﬂawed raw
and uses the secure sketch to obtain an
feature vector (cid:101)V
error corrected (cid:101)V, as described in Section 3.3. The candidate
H((cid:101)V) = H(V). The remainder of this section discusses the
document is considered valid if this feature vector maps to
the same hash value stored in the ﬁngerprint—that is, if

3.1. Estimating document surface texture
To capture the surface texture of a document, we scan it
at four orientations: 0◦, 90◦, 180◦, and 270◦. This allows
recovery of the surface orientation for every sampled surface
point. Our procedure assumes that paper is perfectly diffuse,
which is an assumption that largely holds for near-orthogonal
observation. Diffuse materials reﬂect a portion of the incident
light that is proportional to the cosine of the angle between
the direction of incidence and the surface normal—that is,
proportional to the dot product of these normalized directions.
This property is commonly exploited in photometric stereo
to reconstruct surface normals from multiple images under
varying illumination by a point light source [5]. Similarly,
we apply photometric stereo to the four captured scans.
Flatbed scanners, however, contain a linear light source,
rather than a point source, which disallows the application
of traditional photometric stereo. Brown et al. recently
demonstrated how normals can be derived from ﬂatbed scans
under multiple orientations [6]. Their method, however, relies
on an extensive calibration procedure, which would make
it impractical for authentication purposes. Instead, we will

derive a novel photometric stereo solution for ﬂatbed scanners,
which provides us with information on surface orientation
without the need for dedicated calibration.
Let us deﬁne a coordinate system for the paper and the
scanner so that the paper lies in the xy-plane, the z-axis points
away from the ﬂatbed of the scanner, and the scanner’s linear
light source is parallel to the x-axis. We approximate this light
source by a line segment extending from x1 to x2. We further
assume that the light source is offset with respect to the line
on the paper imaged by the CCD sensor (see Figure 1(a))
by oy in the y-direction and by oz in the z-direction.
Each point on the paper has a normal n and a diffuse color,
or albedo, ρ. Without loss of generality, we concentrate on
a surface point at the origin of our coordinate system. The
observed intensity of such a surface point is then:

As every ﬂatbed scanner is designed
for even illumination, any limiting effects near ends of the
light source are negligible and we shall ignore the integral
limits in the remainder of this discussion.
Scanning the same surface point a second time with the
paper rotated by 180◦ displaces the light source from oy to
−oy. Subtracting the resulting two scans I0◦ and I180◦ from
each other leads to:
