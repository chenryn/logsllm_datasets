• Multi-tenant
– Customers share infrastructure
– Spread out across the world
• Subscription model
– Scales with features and per-license cost
• Free dev accounts
– More limited than paid-for orgs
• AppExchange
– Third party apps (ala App Store)

The Governor
• Each script execution is 
subject to strict limits
• Uncatchable exception 
issued when limits 
exceeded
• Limits based on entry 
point of code
• Limits applied to 
namespaces

Apex limitations
• Language focused on short bursts of 
execution
• Can’t easily alter SF configuration
– Requires web interface interactions
• APIs short on parallel programming 
primitives
– no explicit locks and very broad 
synchronisation
– no real threads
[SensePost – 2009]
 8/21/09
Workarounds
• Delays
• Synchronisation
• Shared mem
• Triggers
• Threads?
[SensePost – 2009]
 8/21/09
Bypassing the governor
• Wanted more usage than permitted for a 
single user action
• Focused on creating event loops
– Initial attempts focused on the callout feature 
and web services and then VisualForce pages 
(no dice)
– Wanted to steer clear of third party 
interference
– Settled on email
• Gave us many rounds (+-1500 a day) of 
execution with a single user action
[SensePost – 2009]

And so?
[SensePost – 2009]

Sifto!
• Ported Nikto into the cloud as a simple 
e.g.
• Process
– Class adds allowed endpoint through HTTP 
calls to SF web interface
– Event loop kicked off against target
• Each iteration performs ten tests
• State simply inserted into datastore at end of ten 
tests
• Trigger object inserted to fire off email for next 
iteration

Pros / cons
• Pros
– Fast(er) with more bandwidth
– Free!
– Capacity for DoS outweighs home user
– How about SF DoS?
• Cons
– Prone to monitoring
– Custom language / platform
– Technique governed by email limits
[SensePost – 2009]
 8/21/09
Sharding
• Accounts have limits
• Accounts are 0-cost
• Accounts can communicate
• How about chaining accounts?
– Sounds good, need to auto-register
• CAPTCHA protects reg
– Not a big issue
• Cool, now in posession of 200+ accounts!
[SensePost – 2009]
 8/21/09
Future Directions
• Sifto is a *really* basic POC hinting at 
possibilities
– Turing complete, open field. Limited API 
though
• Platform is developing rapidly, future 
changes in this area will introduce new 
possibilities
– Callouts in triggers for event loops
– Reduction in limitations
– Improvements in language and APIs
Abstracted functionality on *aaS makes

AWS as a single point of

• Availability is a huge selling point
• Some DoS attacks cant be stopped.. It’s 
simply using the service.. 
• But it does need to be considered..

• We have been going lower and lower with

• There are new problems 
to be solved (and some

power on tap.
