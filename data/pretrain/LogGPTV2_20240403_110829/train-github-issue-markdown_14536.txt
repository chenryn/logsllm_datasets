In Julia, adding docstrings to fields in a non-parametric struct works as expected. For example:

```julia
"doc for my custom struct"
struct TestStruct
    "doc for x"
    x

    "doc for y"
    y
end

# Accessing the docstring for the field `x`
help?> TestStruct.x
```

Output:
```
  doc for x
```

However, when attempting to add docstrings to fields in a parametric struct, an error occurs:

```julia
"doc for my custom parametric struct"
struct TestParametricStruct{T}
    "doc for x"
    x::T

    "doc for y"
    y::Int
end

# Attempting to access the docstring for the field `x` results in an error
help?> TestParametricStruct.x
```

Error:
```
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching Base.Docs.Binding(::Type{TestParametricStruct}, ::Symbol)
