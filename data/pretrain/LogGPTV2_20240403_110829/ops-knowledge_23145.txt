User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题NGINX not working for some users I am serving a static site using NGINX. For most users the site appears fine, for some users, they are served the 'Welcome to nginx on Debian!' default page. They are using the same address www.domain.co.uk where domain is the real domain for the site.

user www-data;
worker_processes 4;
pid /run/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections 768;
}

http {

    server {
        listen 80;

            root /var/www/virtual/domain/;

            # Make site accessible from http://localhost/
            server_name www.domain.co.uk domain.co.uk www.domain.org.uk domain.org.uk;
            location / {
                index index.html index.htm;
            }
    }
    ##
    # Basic Settings
    ##

    sendfile off;
    tcp_nopush on;
    tcp_nodelay on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;
    types_hash_max_size 2048;

    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    # SSL Settings

    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; # Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    ##
    # Logging Settings
    ##

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

    ##
    # Gzip Settings
    ##

    gzip on;
    gzip_disable "msie6";

    ##
    # Virtual Host Configs
    ##

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

}


I haven't been able to replicate this issue at home or in my office on multiple devices. The DNS records haven't changed in at least a year or two.

I'm at a loss to why this might be happening, any help or suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

Assistant: Please try flushing the local DNS cache of the users experiencing the issue.

In Microsoft Windows, this can be done by "ipconfig /flushdns" 

In Ubuntu 16.04, this can be done by "sudo /etc/init.d/nscd restart"
