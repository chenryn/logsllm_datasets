User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Deleted all files and directories in /root (RHEL 6.8) Made a mistake and cleared all directories and files in root. 
I have a root session open still and have created:

# ls -la
total 36 
dr-xr-x---.  2 root root  4096 Nov 24 11:09 .
dr-xr-xr-x. 22 root root  4096 Nov 16 14:23 ..
-rw-------   1 root root 12035 Nov 24 11:53 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--   1 root root    18 Nov 24 11:08 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--   1 root root   184 Nov 24 11:06 .bash_profile
-rw-r--r--   1 root root   481 Nov 24 11:07 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--   1 root root   101 Nov 24 11:09 .cshrc


But when I try to login to "su -" from another user on a second putty session I get a segmentation fault. What could be causing this?

Assistant: Many systems have no important files in /root.

If you use sudo to perform administrative tasks, then /root/.bash_history would never be created in the first place, and the other files in your directory listing would most likely remain static at all times.

As such wiping /root is on the harmless end of the spectrum of destruction you can do to a Linux system.

Removing /root does not prevent logins using su and sudo. It does prevent direct login as root using ssh keys for authentication. But the error message in that case would be different.

So any segmentation fault error message is not caused by missing files. It can however be caused by corrupted files. However since the files on your listing are text files and not binaries, it is unlikely for corruption in those to trigger a segmentation fault.

Since .bashrc is executed by the shell you open and since it does have access to execute arbitrary code, it is in theory possible to put code in there to trigger a segmentation fault and log you out again. But that's not something which happens by accident.

Another possible explanation is that there is some code being used in the login process which is missing error handling and causing a segfault by trying to use a NULL pointer which it got from a library function to indicate a missing file. If you have found such a case you should file a bug report against the program segfaulting, and then recreate the file to mitigate the problem.

Recreating the files in /root can be done either by reinstalling the package which owns the files installed in /root by default or by copying from /etc/skel which is where newly created users otherwise get their initial files from.
