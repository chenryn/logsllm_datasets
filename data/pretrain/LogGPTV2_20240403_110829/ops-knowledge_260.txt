**Issue: Installing PyDev Plugin in Eclipse (Kepler SR2) on a Linux 64-bit Machine Without Internet Connection**

I was assigned to work with Jython and needed to install the PyDev plugin in my Eclipse (Kepler Service Release 2) on a Linux 64-bit machine. Since my development machine does not have an internet connection, I attempted to install the plugin manually by downloading the `.zip` file and following these steps:

1. **Download the PyDev .zip file.**
2. **Open Eclipse and navigate to:**
   - `Help` -> `Install New Software...`
   - Click `Add...` and select `Archive`.
   - Browse to the location of the downloaded `.zip` file.

However, I encountered the following error:
```
No repository found at file:/home/lhananth/eclipse/dropins/PyDev%203.6.0.zip!.
```

Additionally, I tried unzipping the folder and placing it in the `dropins` directory of Eclipse, but Python still did not appear as an option in the `Eclipse` -> `Window` -> `Preferences` menu.

**Resolution:**

After trying various solutions, including those suggested in similar posts on Stack Overflow, I discovered that the issue was related to the Java version installed on my system. PyDev requires JDK 7, but I had JDK 6. 

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Upgrade to JDK 7.**
2. **Copy the unzipped PyDev folder to the `dropins` directory of Eclipse.**
3. **Restart Eclipse.**

Once I upgraded to JDK 7, PyDev appeared in the `Preferences` menu, and I was able to use it successfully.

**Conclusion:**

The problem was not with Eclipse or PyDev, but rather with the Java version. Upgrading to JDK 7 resolved the issue, and PyDev is now working as expected.

Thank you for your help and suggestions!
