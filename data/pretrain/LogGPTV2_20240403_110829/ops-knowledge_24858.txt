User: I am a beginner programmer as well as linux user. Before, I was using windows and the python IDLE was so good. I need not needed to press tab button after the "If" statement or any other loops.
Now, I am using Linux and started to write programs through the command line text editor of ubuntu called as "nano". Here, I need to press tab all the time i use "if" statement. It is very tedious. Especially when there is bunch of nested loops, it becomes difficult to remember the tabs count. And i was thinking if there was any idea to make it work like in the IDLE in windows. I also tried to google the problem but i couldn't explain it in few words. I hope you've got what my problem actually is. And i need a descent solution for this.
Assistant: Try just "M-I" (Esc-I) to switch off autoindent before pasting with Ctrl-Ins (or right mouse click)
