## Abstract

Peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic has been reported to account for a significant portion of backbone networks globally. This trend is particularly pronounced in Japan due to the high penetration rate of fiber-based broadband access. In this paper, we present aggregated traffic measurements collected over 21 months from seven ISPs, covering 42% of the Japanese backbone traffic. Our findings indicate that symmetric residential traffic dominates the backbone, with a 37% increase in 2005. Further analysis of per-customer traffic from one ISP reveals that a small segment of users, specifically 4% of heavy-hitters, accounts for 75% of the inbound volume. Additionally, fiber users contribute 86% of the inbound volume, and approximately 63% of the total residential volume is user-to-user traffic. The dominant applications exhibit poor locality and communicate with a wide range of peers. The distribution of heavy-hitters follows a heavy-tailed pattern, suggesting that users gradually transition from P2P novices to heavy-hitters and often upgrade from DSL to fiber. Our empirical evidence, derived from a large and diverse set of commercial backbone data, indicates that the emergence of new, attractive applications has significantly affected traffic usage and capacity engineering requirements.

## 1. Introduction

Over the past few years, there has been an unprecedented increase in user-to-user traffic worldwide, especially in Japan, which boasts a high penetration rate of fiber-based broadband access. Figure 1 illustrates the traffic growth in Japanese backbones, measured by the aggregated peak traffic at major Internet Exchange Points (IXes): JPIX, JPNAP, and NSPIXP.

While much of the traffic increase on commercial backbones is attributed to P2P traffic, there is limited detailed statistical work to support this. Additionally, planning for future traffic is challenging due to ongoing transformations in residential access and the emergence of new applications and usage patterns. Japan leads in Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) penetration, with the number of FTTH subscribers growing exponentially while DSL subscriber growth slows, as shown in Figure 2.

There is significant concern that, if current trends continue, Internet backbone technologies may struggle to keep pace with the rapidly growing residential traffic. Furthermore, commercial ISPs may find it financially unviable to invest in backbone networks solely to support this low-profit customer segment.

To ensure the evolution of the Internet, it is crucial to understand the effects of growing residential traffic. However, obtaining traffic data from commercial ISPs is both technically and politically challenging. Most ISPs collect sensitive information and are reluctant to share it. Moreover, measurement methods and policies vary among ISPs, making it difficult to compare datasets.

To address these challenges, we formed a study group with specialists from seven major Japanese ISPs to investigate the macro-level impact of residential broadband traffic on ISP backbones. Our goal is to better understand the ratio of residential broadband traffic to other types, changes in traffic patterns, and regional differences across ISPs.

Our results show that the backbone is dominated by symmetric residential traffic, which increased by 37% in 2005. Peak hours have shifted from office hours to evening hours, and a substantial amount of traffic flows consistently.

Using these statistics as reference points, we conducted further analyses of residential traffic data provided by one ISP, revealing diverse behavior patterns.

## 2. Data Collection

We collected our data sets using two different methods:
1. **Aggregated Traffic Data:** We aggregated interface counters of edge routers from seven ISPs to analyze residential traffic at a macroscopic level.
2. **Detailed Per-Customer Data:** We used Sampled NetFlow from one ISP for detailed per-customer analysis.

### 2.1 Aggregated Traffic Data Collection

Most ISPs collect interface counter values via SNMP and archive per-interface traffic logs using MRTG or RRDtool. To facilitate data sharing, we needed a common dataset that all participating ISPs could provide with moderate effort and without revealing sensitive information. The dataset should be coarse enough to protect ISP confidentiality but meaningful enough to analyze residential broadband traffic.

We focused on traffic crossing ISP boundaries, which can be divided into customer traffic and external traffic such as peering and transit. For practical purposes, we selected five traffic groups for data collection, as shown in Figure 3.

![Figure 3: Five traffic groups for data collection at ISP customer and external boundaries](figure3.png)

- **(A1) RBB Customers:** Residential broadband customer lines, including small business customers.
- **(A2) Non-RBB Customers:** Other customer lines, including leased lines, data centers, and dialup lines.
- **(B1) External 6IXes:** Links for six major IXes (JPIX, JPNAP, and NSPIXP in Tokyo and Osaka).
- **(B2) External Domestic:** Domestic external links other than the six IXes, including regional IXes, private peering, and transit.
- **(B3) External International:** International external links with one endpoint outside Japan.
- **(C) Prefectural:** RBB links categorized into 47 prefectures in Japan, a subset of (A1).

These groups were chosen based on existing operational practices. We re-aggregated each ISP’s logs, using only the resulting aggregated traffic to avoid revealing individual ISP shares.

Our main focus is on (A1), RBB customers, but we also examine other categories to understand the relative volume of residential broadband traffic and to cross-check our results. The total customer traffic (A) is (A) = (A1) + (A2). The total external traffic (B) is (B) = (B1) + (B2) + (B3).

In general, summing up traffic values from multiple ISPs is meaningless because a packet can cross ISP boundaries multiple times. However, customer traffic is summable as a packet crosses customer edges only once in each direction. External traffic numbers may be overestimated, but the error is likely negligible.
