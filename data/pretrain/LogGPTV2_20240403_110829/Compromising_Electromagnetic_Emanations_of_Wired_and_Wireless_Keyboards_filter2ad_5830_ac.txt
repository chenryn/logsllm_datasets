there is exactly one rising edge between two falling edge
traces of ’2’, we simply consider the highest clock peak
as the rising edge data transition. For example in Fig-
ure 7, the rising edge data transitions are respectively at
peaks 5 and 9. Thus, the complete data signal is 0010
0100 which corresponds to 0x24 (E). Thus, we manage
to completely recover the keystrokes. Note that the band-
pass ﬁlter improves the previous attack as well. However,
the computation cost prevents real time keystroke recov-
ery without hardware accelerated ﬁlters.
Feature Extraction. The recovery procedure is ﬁrstly
based on the same trigger model described previously
(11 equidistant peaks detected in less than 1 ms). Then,
we ﬁlter the signal to consider only the frequency bands
containing the peak impulses. The feature extraction is
based on the detected peaks. First, we deﬁne the thresh-
old between a high peak and a low peak thanks to the
two ﬁrst peaks. Indeed, because we know that data and
clock are pulled down, the ﬁrst one corresponds to a state
where clock is high and data is low and the second one
describes the state where both signals are low. Then, we
determine the potential (and colliding) keystrokes with
Figure 5.
In our example, it corresponds to the keys
3,6,E,G. Then, we select some bits which differenti-
ate these keys. According to their scan code 3=0x26,
6=0x36, E=0x24, G=0x34 we check the state of the
peaks 4 and 8 in Figure 7, which correspond to respec-
tively the second and the ﬁfth bit of the scan codes. Be-
cause they are both low, we conclude that the transmitted
key is E.
5.3 The Modulation Technique
Figure 2 highlights some carriers with harmonics (verti-
cal lines between 116 MHz and 147 MHz). These com-
promising electromagnetic emissions come from unin-
tentional emanations such as radiations emitted by the
clock, non-linear elements, crosstalk, ground pollution,
etc. Determining theoretically the reasons of these com-
promising radiations is a very complex task. Thus, we
can only sketch some probable causes. The source of
these harmonics corresponds to a carrier of approxi-
mately 4 MHz which is very likely the internal clock of
the microcontroller inside the keyboard. Interestingly, if
we correlate these harmonics with both clock and data
signals, we clearly see modulated signals (in amplitude
and frequency) which fully describe the state of both
clock and data signals, see Figure 8. This means that
the scan code can be completely recovered from these
harmonics.
Figure 8: The amplitude and frequency modulations of
the harmonic at 124 MHz correlated to both data and
clock signals (Keyboard A1, semi-anechoic chamber at
5 meters).
Note that even if some strong electromagnetic interfer-
ences emerge, the attacker may choose non-jammed har-
monics to obtain a clear signal. It is even possible to su-
perpose them to improve the SNR. Compared to the pre-
vious techniques, the carrier-based modulation is much
more interesting for distant reception. Indeed, AM and
FM transmissions are generally less disrupted by noise
and obstacles such as walls, ﬂoors, etc. Moreover this
technique is able to fully recover the keystrokes. These
indirect emanations – which have no formal explanation,
but are probably based on crosstalk with the ground, the
internal clock of the microcontroller, data and clock sig-
nals – let the attacker recover the keystrokes of a key-
board.
This experiment shows that cheap devices such as key-
boards may radiate indirect emanations, which are much
8
more compromising than direct emanations. Even if the
SNR is smaller, the use of a frequency modulation sig-
niﬁcantly improves the eavesdropping range. Moreover,
the attacker may avoid some noisy frequency bands by
selecting only the clearest harmonics. Furthermore, indi-
rect emanations completely describe both clock and data
signals.
Feature Extraction. The feature extraction is based
on the demodulation in frequency and amplitude of the
captured signal centered on the strongest harmonic. In
our example and according to Figure 8 the carrier cor-
responds to 124 MHz. We used the GNU Radio library
to demodulate the signal. However, we still need to use
the trigger model based on peak detector since the mem-
ory of the oscilloscope is limited. Another option is to
directly capture the signal with the USRP. Indeed, the
lower but continuous sampling rate of the USRP is suf-
ﬁcient to recover the keystrokes. Unfortunately, the sen-
sitivity of the USRP is weaker than the oscilloscope and
the eavesdropping range is limited to less than 2 meters
in the semi-anechoic chamber.
5.4 The Matrix Scan Technique
The techniques described above are related to the use of
PS/2 and some laptop keyboards. However, new key-
boards tend to use USB or wireless communication. In
this section, we present another compromising emana-
tion which concerns all keyboard types: PS/2, USB,
Notebooks and even wireless keyboards. This attack was
previously postulated by Kuhn and Anderson [20] but no
practical data has appeared so far in the open literature.
Almost all keyboards share the same pressed key de-
tection routine. A major technical constraint is to con-
sider a key as pressed if the button is pushed for 10 ms,
see US Patent [31]. Thus every pressed key should be
detected within this time delay. From the manufacturer’s
point of view, there is another main constraint: the cost
of the device. A naive solution to detect pressed keys is
to poll each key in a row. This solution is clearly not op-
timal since it requires a large scan loop routine and thus
longer delays. Moreover important leads (i.e. one circuit
for each key) increase the cost of the device.
A smart solution [31] is to arrange the keys in a matrix.
The keyboard controller, often a 8-bit processor, parses
columns one-by-one and recovers the state of 8 keys at
once. This matrix scan process can be described as 192
keys (some keys may not be used, for instance modern
keyboards use 104/105 keys) arranged in 24 columns and
8 rows. Columns are connected to a driver chip while
rows are connected to a detector chip. Keys are placed
at the intersection of columns and rows. Each key is an
analog switch between a column and a row. The key-
board controller pulses each column through the driver
(using the address bus and the strobe signal). The detec-
tor measures the states of the 8 rows. Note that a row
is connected to 24 keys, but only one may be active, the
one selected by the driver. Suppose we pressed the key
corresponding to column 3 and row 5. The controller
pulses columns . . ., 22, 23, 24, 1, 2 with no key event.
Now, the controller pulses column 3. Row 5, which cor-
responds to the pressed key, is detected. The keyboard
starts a subroutine to transmit the scan code of the key
to the computer. This subroutine takes some time. Thus,
the next column pulse sent by the scan routine is delayed.
Columns in the matrix are long leads since they con-
nect generally 8 keys. According to [31], these columns
are continuously pulsed one-by-one for at least 3µs.
Thus, these leads may act as an antenna and generate
electromagnetic emanations. If an attacker is able to cap-
ture these emanations, he can easily recover the column
of the pressed key. Indeed, the following pulse will be
delayed.
To ﬁgure out if these emanations can be captured, we
picked Keyboard A6 and acquired the signal being one
meter from the keyboard in the semi-anechoic chamber
with a simple one meter long wire of copper as antenna.
Figure 9 gives the repeated peak burst continuously emit-
ted by the keyboard. Figure 10 shows the zoomed com-
promising emanations when the key C resp. key H is
pressed.

tled a keyboard and analyzed the key circuit layout to
retrieve the matrix key speciﬁcations. The right part of
the keyboard layout is depicted on Figure 11. We clearly
identify a column (black) and fours rows.

tions (or column number) for Keyboard A6. We describe
each electromagnetic signal as a number corresponding
to the delayed peak. For example, in Figure 10, the key
C is described as 12 and the key H as 7.
Even if this signal does not fully describe the pressed
key, it still gives partial information on the transmitted
scan code, i.e. the column number. So, as described in
the Falling Edge Transition Technique, collisions occurs
between key codes. Note that this attack is less efﬁcient
than the ﬁrst one since it has (for this speciﬁc keyboard)
in average 5.14286 potential key codes for a keystroke
(alpha-numeric only). However, an exhaustive search on
the subset is still a major improvement.
Note that the matrix scan routine loops continuously.
When no key is pressed, we still have a signal composed
of multiple equidistant peaks. These emanations may be
used to remotely detect the presence of powered comput-
ers.
Concerning wireless keyboards, the wireless data burst
transmission can be used as an electromagnetic trigger
to detect exactly when a key is pressed, while the ma-
trix scan emanations are used to determine the column
it belongs to. Moreover the ground between the key-
board and the computer is obviously not shared, thus the
compromising electromagnetic emanations are stronger
than those emitted by wired keyboards. Note that we do
not consider the security of the wireless communication
protocol. Some wireless keyboards use a weakly or not
encrypted channel to communicate with the computer,
see [8, 23].
Feature Extraction. To partially recover keystrokes, we
continuously monitor the compromising emanations of
the matrix scan routine with a speciﬁc trigger model.
According to Figure 12 the six ﬁrst peaks are always
present, as well as the last three peaks.
Indeed, these
peaks are never missing (or delayed). Thus, we use this

are able to deduce on which column the pressed key be-
longs to. On this keyboard, there will be a collision
between keystrokes 7, U, J, M, and others non alpha-
numeric keys such as F6, F7, b, and the dot.

ﬁxed pattern to deﬁne a trigger model. Moreover, the
matrix scan continuously radiates compromising emana-
tions since the key is pressed. When a keystroke subset is
detected, we acquire multiple samples until another pat-
tern is detected. Therefore, we pick the most often cap-
tured pattern.
5.5 Distinguishing Keystrokes from Multi-
ple Keyboards
The falling edge-based traces are distinguishable de-
pending on the keyboard model.
Indeed, according to
the frequency of the peaks, the clock frequency incon-
sistencies, the duration between clock and data falling
edges, we are able to deduce a speciﬁc ﬁngerprint for
every keyboard. When multiple keyboards are radiating
at the same time, we are able to identify and differenti-
ate them. For example, we measured a clock frequency
of 12.751 KHz when a key was pressed on a keyboard
and the clock frequency was 13.752 KHz when a key
was pressed on another keyboard. Thus, when an em-
anation is captured, we measure the time between two
falling edges of the clock and then we deduce if the scan
code comes from ﬁrst or the second keyboard. In prac-
tice, we were able to differentiate all the keyboards we
tested, even if the brand and the model were equivalent.
This method can be applied to the Falling Edge Tran-
sition Technique, the Generalized Transition Technique
and the Modulation Technique since they rely on the
same kind of signal. The distinguishing process for
the Modulation Technique can even be improved by us-
ing the clock frequency inconsistencies of the micro-
controller as another identiﬁer. For the Matrix Scan
Technique, the compromising electromagnetic emana-
tion burst emitted every 2.5 ms (see Figure 9) can be
used as a synchronization signal to identify a speciﬁc
keyboard emission among multiple keyboards. Addition-
ally, the duration between the scan peaks is different, de-
pending on the keyboard model. Thus, it may be used
to identify the source keyboard. However, the continu-
ous emission signiﬁcantly deteriorates the identiﬁcation
process.
Another physical element can be used to distinguish
keystrokes from multiple keyboards. For the three ﬁrst
techniques, the broadband impulse range is determined
by the length of the keyboard cable, which forms a reso-
nant dipole. Thus, we can use this particularity to iden-
tify the source of a compromising emanation. An inter-
esting remark is that the length of the wire connecting
the computer to the keyboard is shorter in notebooks.
The frequency band of the compromising emanation is
higher and the SNR smaller. The Matrix Scan Technique
emanates at a higher frequency since the leads of the key-
board layout, acting as an antenna, are shorter.
6 Evaluation in Different Environments
While we have demonstrated techniques that should be
able to extract information from keyboard emanations,
we have not studied how they are affected by different
environments. In this section we study the accuracy of
our approaches in all the environments described. Our
analysis indicates that keyboard emanations are indeed
