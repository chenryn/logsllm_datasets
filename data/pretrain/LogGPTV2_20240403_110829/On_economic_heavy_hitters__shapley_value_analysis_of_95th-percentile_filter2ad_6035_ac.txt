proximately 10% of users whose relative cost contribution is
more than twice the relative byte counters (ρi > 2) and an-
other 10% of users with relative cost contribution less than
half of its relative byte count (ρi < 0.5). The proportion of
users with very large or very small ρi is even higher for low-
Shapley-value users (the remaining 85% of the dataset), but
we avoid reporting these numbers because of the accuracy
issues for the low-Shapley-value users (see Section 3.2).
Another interesting statistics is that around 30% of top-
1% (and around 25% of top-10%) Shapley value users are
not in the corresponding top-1% (top-10%) byte-count list.
3.4 Relative cost of bandwidth
As we already mentioned in the Introduction, the conse-
quence of the 95th-percentile pricing of the transit traﬃc is
that the bandwidth is “more expensive” in the peak hours
than in the oﬀ-peak hours. Here we use the Shapley value
framework to quantify how the value of bandwidth changes
in time. Namely we seek to ﬁnd the hourly per-byte prices
c1, . . . , c24, such that if a user i is charged ch monetary units
for each byte downloaded during hour h, then the monthly
bill is (approximately) equal to its Shapley value. More for-
mally, if Zi(t) is the usage of user i at time t = 1, ..., 720, we
seek for c1, . . . , c24 ≥ 0 such that

Zi(h + 24(d − 1)) ≈ φi, ∀i ∈ N .
Given that the above system of equations is overdeter-
mined (it has 24 variables and 10K equations), we need to
seek a ﬁt that matches some optimization criteria. A well
know method for approximating solution of the overdeter-
mined linear systems is the nonnegative least square (nnls)
method that seeks to minimize

Very eﬃcient solutions for nnls problem have been pro-
posed recently and we use [10] to solve our problem. Run-
ning nnls over our dataset, we derive time series c1, . . . , c24
depicted in Figure 6. One can observe that (for the dataset
analyzed here) in the 95th-percentile setup, the bandwidth
is “free” (has virtually zero impact on the 95th-percentile)
for some 18 hours per day and has strictly positive cost dur-
ing 6 hours per day. Note that even though the monthly
95th-percentile is crossed during only one or two hours per
day, the cost of bandwidth is still non-zero for 6 (near-peak)
hours.

4. RELATED WORK
Per user analysis of broadband internet traﬃc was a sub-
ject of several recent studies. Cho et al. analyzes broadband
traﬃc from several Japanese ISPs in [4, 5]. They analyze the
per-user traﬃc usage and they show that it is highly skewed5
(can be modeled with a log-normal distribution). With the
duration of the dataset they analyzed, they were able to
track upload/download traﬃc trends over multiple years and
quantify the eﬀects diﬀerent applications have on the traf-
ﬁc aggregates. In [15] Maier et al. perform a measurement
study of residential broadband users in one European ISP
and analyze several relevant metrics: per-application usage,
DSL session duration, and observable round trip-times. Here
we take a diﬀerent look at the broadband traﬃc by analyz-
ing per-user temporal usage patterns and how they impact
the costs for the access provider.
One of the key reasons that inﬂuence traﬃc shaping (also
known as traﬃc discrimination) of Internet traﬃc is the fact
that by throttling some traﬃc, ISPs control (reduce) their
costs [16]. Dhamdhere and Dovrolis [7] and Biczok et al [1]
analyze several broadband pricing models that aim to oﬀer
a solution that obey the net neutrality rules by discriminat-
ing the price of the heavy-hitters (based on the total bytes
downloaded/uploaded).
In this work we empirically show
that the heavy-hitters are not necessarily expensive for the
ISP and that temporal usage eﬀects should be taken into
account when designing pricing models in the context of net
neutrality.
Briscoe [2, 3] argues that fairness mechanisms in computer
networks should be judged on “how they share out the ‘cost’
of each user’s action on others” and he oﬀers several heuris-
tics (e.g. he suggests that the number of dropped packets
over a billing circle is a good indicator of a customer’s cost
contribution) for evaluating the ‘cost’. The Shapley value
framework we introduced here can be seen as a formal way
to measure user’s cost contribution.
Pricing of communication networks has been extensively
studied in the past; see [6] and references therein. These
eﬀorts mainly focus on how to use pricing to achieve some
form of social welfare (or revenue) maximization. We stress
that we do not aim to propose a new pricing scheme in
this paper, but rather set to measure the diversity of the
broadband usage behavior patterns and their eﬀect on the
peak hour consumption.
5The fact that we also observe in our dataset.
79Recently, several research eﬀorts suggested using Shapley
value as a means for providing incentives for optimal re-
source control. Ma et al. promote use of Shapley value for
ISP settlement by proposing revenue sharing among ISPs
based on the importance each ISP has on the Internet ecosys-
tem [13, 14]. In the context of peer-to-peer systems, Misra
et al. [17] propose using Shapley value to incentivize coop-
eration in p2p systems.
The 95th-percentile pricing has been analyzed recently by
Dimitropoulos et al.
[8]. They quantify the dependence
between the size of measurement slot and the observed 95th-
percentile and show that this dependence becomes weak for
large volumes of traﬃc. Laoutaris et al.
[12] use the 95th-
percentile pricing to propose ISP-friendly bulk transfers that
explicitly avoid to use bandwidth that could increase the
95th-percentile.
5. SUMMARY
Days in which the technological reasons were impacting
the performance of the residential Internet users are coming
to an end and in the near future, the performance oﬀered
to the end users will be predominantly shaped by the eco-
nomic factors rather than physical bottlenecks. In such en-
vironments it is crucial to determine the cost contribution of
each individual user to the operation of ISP, as it would be
a key metric for evaluating the consumption and accounting
in such an ecosystem. Our study is a step towards the fairer
usage of the Internet in which economic aspects dominate
the per-user performance as it formally quantiﬁes the indi-
vidual per-user cost contributions in the speciﬁc context of
burstable (95th-percentile) billing.
In the future we plan to investigate the eﬀects the traﬃc
shaping (e.g. p2p throttling [9]) has on the customers’ Shap-
ley value, as well as the relationship between the operational
parameters (oversubscription rate, nominal capacities, etc.)
and the Shapley value. Finally, in light of the fact that the
Shapley value is an oﬀ-line (and somewhat complex) metric,
it would be useful to ﬁnd a simpler online metric that ac-
curately approximates the Shapley value (one possible way
would be along the lines discussed in Section 3.4).

APPENDIX
A. THE 95TH-PERCENTILE PRICING
The 95th-percentile pricing is the most prevalent method
that transit ISPs use for charging their customers. A billing
cycle, typically one month, is split in constant-size inter-
vals (e.g. 5-min or 1-hour) and number of bytes transferred
in each interval is recorded, and the 95th-percentile of the
distribution of recorded samples is used for billing. Thus,
in a billing cycle of 30 days, 36 hours (5% of time) of the
heaviest traﬃc is ﬁltered out, and then the maximal traf-
ﬁc of the remaining 684 hours is used for billing. Usually,
the downstream and upstream 95th-percentile are computed
independently, and the lower value is neglected.
The 95th-percentile is also a good measure of how utilized
the network is, and is often used as an indicator for dimen-
sioning of infrastructure, whose cost is determined by the
peak hour demand.
