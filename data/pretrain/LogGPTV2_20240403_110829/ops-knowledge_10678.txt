User: In a multi-person collaborative development project, how to avoid code conflicts?
Assistant: The following are some best practices for avoiding code conflicts: 1. Branch management: Use the branch function of a version control system (such as Git) for multi-person collaborative development. Everyone develops and modifies on their own branch, and finally merges into on the master branch. 2. Submit regularly: Everyone needs to submit code regularly and update their own local code base in time to avoid conflicts with other people's code. 3. Test verification: Before submitting the code, local testing and code review should be carried out to ensure the quality and reliability of the code. 4. Unified coding standards: formulate unified coding standards and naming standards to avoid code inconsistencies or naming conflicts. 5. Write clear comments: Document the code's role and modification history in detail so that others can understand and modify the code. 6. Avoid directly modifying the main branch: Unless it is very necessary, you should avoid directly modifying the main branch, but develop and test locally before merging. 7. Communicate in a timely manner: Before making code modifications, communicate with other developers and negotiate the modification method and time to avoid conflicts and duplication of work.
