I aimed to create a custom "build tool" for Sublime Text to run my Python scripts using an Anaconda environment with TensorFlow. While this setup works seamlessly on my other machines, I encountered an issue on my Ubuntu system that supports GPU.

**Problem Description:**
- **Error Message:** `ImportError: libcudart.so.8.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
- **Context:** The error suggests that the CUDA libraries are not being found, even though I have included the necessary paths in my `.bashrc` file.
- **Update:** I tried exporting the paths in `~/.profile`, but TensorFlow still fails to start from Sublime Text. However, running the script directly from the terminal works without any issues.

**Solution:**
- **Cause:** The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable was missing. It was only set in `.bashrc`, which is not sourced when Sublime Text is launched.
- **Resolution:**
  - Add the following lines to `~/.profile`:
    ```sh
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
    ```
  - Ensure you restart your session or log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
  - Alternatively, you can start Sublime Text from the terminal using the `subl` command, which will pass all the environment variables correctly.

By ensuring the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is properly set, TensorFlow can now find the required CUDA libraries, and the build tool in Sublime Text functions as expected.
