### What happened
Statuses of `Tasks`: `'running'`, `'queued'` don't update inside TaskGroup.
New task statuses appear only with reclick on `TaskGroup`.
### What you expected to happen
I expect that statuses of `Tasks` are actual. Withou reclick on `TaskGroup`
### How to reproduce
Create `TaskGroup` with `Task`, run `DAG`, close `DAG` window and u will see
empty statuses of tasks.
### Anything else
Problem occurs always.
