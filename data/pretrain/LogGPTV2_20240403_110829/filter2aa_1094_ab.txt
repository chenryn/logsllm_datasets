11. Before transmitting, the device will sense the power in the three channels above 
the one it wishes to transmit in and the three channels below it. It will then reduce 
its transmit power by employing a TPC factor as indicated by the algorithm 
below: 
12. Assume that the unlicensed device has concluded that channel “k” is vacant and it 
wishes to transmit in that channel.  Let Xk+i be the received average power at the 
unlicensed device in an occupied channel “i” channels away from the channel the 
device wishes to transmit in (i.e. channel k).  As stated above, the device will 
measure the power in 3 channels above and below channel “k”. Therefore “i” will 
be +3, +2, +1, -1, -2, -3.  
13. As long as the received DTV signal power at the unlicensed device is between                 
-65 dBm and -90 dBm, the transmit power of the device is governed by Table 1. 
In the case where the received DTV power exceeds -65 dBm, the unlicensed 
device power is limited to a maximum of 20 dBm EIRP. When the received 
power is below -90 dBm for k= ±1, ±2 and ±3 , the unlicensed transmit power is 
fixed at -5 dBm.  
14. In the case where more than one TV channel is occupied within ± 3 channels of 
the channel the unlicensed device wishes to utilize, it will transmit at the lowest 
EIRP derived from the rules above and Table 1 below.

The Coalition notes that the approach taken above is more conservative—and thus 
provides more protection—than the requirements set forth in OET Bulletin 69.8   
If in the future systems can be designed so that their spectral mask attenuates 
leakage into channels k= ± 2 and k= ± 3 in excess of the 55 dB shown in Figure 1 then 
the allowed power in Table 1 for k= ± 2 and k= ± 3 governing those systems should be

allowed to increase dB for dB.  For example, if a system can conform to a mask with an 
attenuation floor of 60 dB then the allowable power for that system for k= ± 2 and k= ± 3 
should be  X k±2 + 90 dBm, X k±3 + 90 dBm. 
Illustrative examples in the use of the table and the rules above are instructive. 
Consider the case where only the adjacent channel is occupied and the received average 
power at the unlicensed device in that channel is -105 dBm.  Since the received power is 
below -90 dBm, the unlicensed device will transmit at an average power of -5 dBm.  On 
the other hand, if the received signal at the unlicensed device was -70 dBm, the table row 
for i equal to ± 1 yields an EIRP of 15 dBm.  The device will transmit at an average 
power of 15 dBm or the minimum power required for reliable communication, whichever 
is less.  
Now consider the case where the adjacent channel (i=1) is occupied with a 
detected signal of -60 dBm and the next channel (i=2) is occupied with a detected signal 
of -85 dBm.  The detected power in the adjacent channel would permit an EIRP of 20 
dBm, however, the transmitted power is limited by the lower power in channel i = 2 (0 
dBm EIRP) or the minimum power required for reliable communication, whichever is 
less.  
B. 
The Proposed Spectrum Sensing Approach Will Provide Broadcasters 
with the Protection to which they are Entitled.   
A number of comments in this proceeding have raised objections, both general 
and specific, to the widespread use of the white spaces.  Many of these concerns assume 
higher power fixed operations, and simply do not apply to the low power operations the 
Coalition has proposed.  While the Coalition will not address each of these objections 
individually, it would take this opportunity to address some of the larger concerns raised 
9
by incumbent licensees.   Moreover, the Coalition encourages the Commission to address 
any legitimate concerns raised in this proceeding by testing the prototype device.   
1. 
The proposed detection threshold is more than sufficient to guard 
against harmful co-channel interference.     
In its opening comments, the Coalition proposed that the Commission use the 
Threshold of Visibility (“TOV”) as a proxy for TV channel vacancy at the Grade B 
Contour.9  Specifically, because DTV receivers require a signal level above TOV to 
reproduce a transmitted picture, it is reasonable to conclude that a channel is available for 
use at a particular time and geographic location by a personal/portable device if the signal 
level falls below TOV (approximately -84 dBm for DTV signals).  As noted above, to 
ensure that incumbent licensees are protected, the Coalition proposed a detection 
threshold of -114 dBm, a full 30 dB below TOV for DTV signals.10     
The broadcasters’ primary objection to the exclusive use of a signal detection 
threshold is that a TV signal could be weak, but nevertheless within the protected contour 
of a television station.11  To be clear, however, location alone does not determine the 
scope of a licensee’s protection from harmful interference.12  Rather, the touchstone of a 
claim of interference protection is whether that interference negatively impacts a signal 
that would otherwise produce a viewable picture.13  On occasion in this proceeding,

12  Harmful interference is defined as interference that “seriously degrades, obstructs, or repeatedly 
interrupts a radiocommunication service.”  47 C.F.R. § 2.1.   
13  See, e.g., Interference: Defining the Source, FCC Consumer Facts, available at 
http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/interference.html (last visited Feb. 27, 2007) (noting that 
10
broadcasters have attempted to assert interference “protection” where there is no 
television picture or consumer impact to protect.14  This makes no sense.           
MSTV also contends that harmful co-channel interference from unlicensed 
devices presents a potential interference problem for miles.15  For example, in an exhibit, 
MSTV maintains that an unlicensed device must be kept sufficiently out of range so that 
its co-channel emissions will not increase the apparent receiver noise floor, and initially 
speculates that “to keep the free space interference field 20 dB below the desired DTV 
signal would require a separation of 600 miles” for a 4 watt device.16  MSTV later 
concludes that a range of 15 miles is appropriate to protect against co-channel 
interference after accounting for obstacles on the horizon, but fails to take into account 
TPC.17  As the Commission surely knows, the 600 mile figure is nonsensical even as a 
starting point.  Megawatt full power TV stations operate on the same channel at much 
closer distances than six hundred miles, usually about 150 miles. To suggest that six 
hundred mile separation from a 4 watt device should be considered in any way only 
demonstrates the embarrassing lengths some will go to in an attempt to “protect” 
spectrum for which they do not have a license (i.e. the white spaces).  Nothing could 
interference is, among other things, “any unwanted radio frequency signal that prevents you from 
watching television …”).   
14  See, e.g., MSTV Comments at 12 n.29.  The signal levels within Grade B Contour cited by MSTV are 
at best -99 dBm at the receiver, and could not reproduce a picture even with the aid of an outdoor 
antenna.

better demonstrate the need for an objective, independent Commission assessment of 
harmful interference risks.      
MSTV also makes much of a prior Intel calculation suggesting that the 
interference range of personal/portable devices could be up to five miles.18  As discussed 
previously, the Coalition has invested thousands of hours in research since the Intel 
filing, and learned much.  That not withstanding, the intent of Intel’s submission was to 
adopt a series of conservative parameters.  For example, Intel assumed a free space 
propagation model for its hypothetical personal/portable device, and also did not apply 
TPC in its calculations—which would reduce the transmitted power well below 100 mW 
in almost every case.19  In any event, the Coalition has proposed 30 dB of protection 
beyond TOV, and also has proposed a dynamic range of 25 dB for TPC to be absolutely 
certain no harmful interference is caused.  As with the other issues in this proceeding, the 
Commission’s independent testing should be the final word on the subject.    
2. 
Personal/portable devices can successfully operate in adjacent 
channels.  
Comments opposing widespread use of the white spaces also have objected to the 
use of adjacent channels by unlicensed devices.20  As a threshold matter, the Coalition 
notes that the IEEE 802.22 working group, which has been cited by those opposing 
adjacent channel uses, has confined itself to examining fixed devices and does not 
address the ability of personal/portable devices to access adjacent channels.  Indeed, the 4 
watt EIRP devices discussed by IEEE 802.22 radiate at up to 40 times more power than 
18  See Comments of Intel Corp. (filed. Nov. 30, 2004) at App. A.    
19  See id. at 5-6.   
20  See, e.g. MSTV Comments at 16-21; IEEE 802.18 Comments at 8-9.   
12
the maximum output of personal/portable devices proposed by the Coalition, which is 
reduced by TPC as discussed above.  In addition, the IEEE submission contains no data 
or technical analysis whatsoever to support its claims, a somewhat unusual practice for 
this engineering body.   
Though MSTV does submit data in an attempt to bolster its contention that any 
operation of a TV band device on a station’s first adjacent channel will cause harmful 
interference,21 this claim is equally unpersuasive.  Most significantly, MSTV completely 
fails to take into account the use of TPC, which would dramatically reduce the device’s 
radiated power and, consequently, the risk of interference.  This omission is especially 
telling given that the Further Notice specifically inquired as to the use of TPC to enable 
adjacent channel operations.22  If the substantially reduced power levels mandated by 
TPC posed a significant risk of adjacent channel interference, doubtless MSTV would 
have let the Commission know.  MSTV’s silence speaks volumes. 
The Coalition also notes that MSTV has employed a free space propagation 
model in support of its arguments regarding adjacent channel interference.23  To be sure, 
the initial NPRM did indicate that a free space model could be used for distances up to 
1.5 kilometers, but this model is simply inappropriate for personal/portable devices.  
While a free space model is a very conservative worst case assumption for the ten-meter 
21  MSTV Comments at 16.

23  MSTV Comments at 16.  
13
user terminal masts proposed by the IEEE,24 it manifestly is not representative of the 
homes, offices, and campuses where personal/portable devices would be deployed.    
Finally, MSTV has contended that its DTV receiver tests demonstrate the risk of 
interference on a number of adjacent and taboo channels.25  MSTV notes that its tested 
receivers responded differently to various interference tests, and argues that, in evaluating 
different types of interference, the Commission should establish one set of criteria that 
will protect each of MSTV’s tested receivers.26  The unstated premise of this argument is 
that the Commission must protect the lowest common denominator for each type of 
interference tested, making white space use captive to the aggregated flaws of each 
receiver. 
The Coalition strongly urges the Commission to reject this proposal.  Varying 
interference rejection in a number of receivers should not impose a burden on unlicensed 
device operation—particularly if the receivers cannot even meet the ATSC receiver 
specifications.  Nor should the Commission accept at face value MSTV’s claims about 
interference from multiple devices, which the Coalition has accounted for in its mask and 
TPC rules.  If the Commission sets unnecessary and overly restrictive standards, it will 
remove all incentive for manufacturers to design receivers enabling efficient spectrum 
use.       
Any evaluation done by the Commission should ensure that TV receivers, at 
minimum, observe the ATSC receiver specifications.  Failing that, the Coalition urges the 
24  IEEE 802.18 Comments at 11.

14
Commission to establish its own reasonable standards of protection.  An unduly 
restrictive standard will simply make it uneconomic for manufacturers to build and 
market devices.  As a result, the American public will lose, and the only winners will be 
those who wish to make poor quality receivers—which face a substantially greater risk of 
interference from adjacent DTV transmissions than from the personal/portable devices 
proposed by the Coalition.  In short, protecting consumers and promoting spectral 
efficiency are not only a matter of regulating unlicensed devices, but also of ensuring that 
receivers have decent affordable performance, at least to the ATSC receiver 
specifications.       
3. 
Low power television stations. 
Finally, a number of Class A, TV translator, and other low power stations have 
filed comments in this proceeding expressing concerns about interference protection and 
proposing various restrictions.27  As with full-power DTV signals, the algorithm 
proposed by the Coalition will provide these stations (both analog and digital) with the 
interference protection to which they are entitled.  In this regard, the Coalition notes that 
some comments would have the Commission use this proceeding to extend the scope of 
their licenses, as they have assumed (if not specifically requested) protection at their 
Grade B Contour or beyond notwithstanding that low power licensees are protected only 
at their Grade A contours.28  None of the proposals that low power TV licensees have set 
27  See, e.g. Comments of Community Broadcasters’ Association (“CBA Comments”); Comments of 
Entravision Holdings, LLC (“Entravision Comments”); Comments of Sevier Valley Communications 
(“SVC Comments”); Comments of the National Translator Association; Comments of the Region 1 
Translator Association.

forth in this proceeding need to be adopted as long as they receive the protection to which 
they are entitled, and the Coalition is confident that the Commission will confirm that 
Coalition’s prototype is more than equal to this task.        
C. 
Testing.   
Throughout this proceeding, the Coalition has supported the Commission’s 
commitment to perform objective testing to determine the appropriate parameters under 
which devices could operate in the TV white spaces.  Indeed, given the amount of less 
than realistic information placed in the record to date, objective verification of many of 
the parties’ competing claims will be essential.  The Coalition urges the Commission to 
give preference to those technical and operational proposals supported by devices that 
have been made available for testing. 
The Coalition has every confidence that the Commission will design and 
implement a series of objective tests that will confirm that incumbent licensees are 
protected and will reject attempts by parties to tip the scales under the guise of 
recommended test suites.  However, the Coalition is compelled to comment on the 
request by MSTV to make prototypes available for inspection “by the public” – in other 
words by MSTV.29  This request should be rejected out of hand.  The Coalition already 
has invested a substantial amount of time and money on its TV band device program, and 
its prototype contains confidential information that could place the Coalition’s members 
at a competitive disadvantage if released prematurely.  MSTV does not offer a rationale 
for inspection of the device.  The Coalition trusts the Commission to conduct fair and 
29  MSTV Comments at 7-8.   
16
impartial testing of submitted devices.  Indeed, the primary advantage to Commission 
testing is to confirm how the device performs under objective testing.   
II. 
PERSONAL/PORTABLE DEVICES SHOULD BE AUTHORIZED AT THE SAME TIME 
AS FIXED DEVICES, IF NOT BEFORE.    
In its opening comments, the Coalition urged the Commission not to delay the 
introduction of personal/portable devices, but instead to authorize such devices at the 
same time that it authorizes fixed devices.30  Those opposing the use of personal/portable 
devices maintain that insufficient information is available for personal/portable devices as
