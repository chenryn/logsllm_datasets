### Compliance with ATSC Standards
The device will meet or exceed the ATSC standards.

### Power Sensing and Transmit Power Adjustment
**Figure 1**

**Step 1: Power Sensing**
Before transmitting, the device will measure the power in the three channels above and the three channels below the one it intends to use. The device will then adjust its transmit power using a TPC (Transmit Power Control) factor, as outlined in the following algorithm:

**Step 2: Channel Vacancy Determination**
Assume the unlicensed device has determined that channel “k” is vacant and it wishes to transmit on this channel. Let \( X_{k+i} \) represent the received average power at the unlicensed device in an occupied channel “i” channels away from the intended transmission channel (channel k). The device measures the power in 3 channels above and below channel “k”. Therefore, “i” can be +3, +2, +1, -1, -2, or -3.

**Step 3: Transmit Power Regulation**
- **Received DTV Signal Power Between -65 dBm and -90 dBm**: The transmit power of the device is governed by Table 1.
- **Received DTV Power Exceeds -65 dBm**: The unlicensed device's power is limited to a maximum of 20 dBm EIRP.
- **Received Power Below -90 dBm for \( k = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3 \)**: The unlicensed device’s transmit power is fixed at -5 dBm.

**Step 4: Multiple Occupied Channels**
If more than one TV channel is occupied within ± 3 channels of the channel the unlicensed device wishes to use, the device will transmit at the lowest EIRP derived from the rules above and Table 1.

**Table 1: Allowable Unlicensed Device Transmit Power**

| Channel Offset "i" | Transmit Power Control (TPC) Factor | EIRP (dBm) |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| 0                  | 0 dB = EIRP >= -5 dBm               |             |
| ± 1                | 20 - (X\(_{k±1}\) + 85) dB          | X\(_{k±1}\) + 85 dBm |
| ± 2                | 20 - (X\(_{k±2}\) + 85) dB          | X\(_{k±2}\) + 85 dBm |
| ± 3                | 20 - (X\(_{k±3}\) + 85) dB          | X\(_{k±3}\) + 85 dBm |

**Note:** The approach taken above is more conservative and provides more protection than the requirements set forth in OET Bulletin 69.8. If future systems can be designed to attenuate leakage into channels \( k = \pm 2 \) and \( k = \pm 3 \) beyond the 55 dB shown in Figure 1, the allowed power in Table 1 for these channels should increase accordingly. For example, if a system can conform to a mask with an attenuation floor of 60 dB, the allowable power for that system for \( k = \pm 2 \) and \( k = \pm 3 \) should be \( X\(_{k±2}\) + 90 \) dBm and \( X\(_{k±3}\) + 90 \) dBm, respectively.

### Illustrative Examples

1. **Single Occupied Adjacent Channel**:
   - **Received Average Power in Adjacent Channel: -105 dBm**:
     - Since the received power is below -90 dBm, the unlicensed device will transmit at an average power of -5 dBm.
   - **Received Signal at -70 dBm**:
     - The table row for \( i = \pm 1 \) yields an EIRP of 15 dBm. The device will transmit at an average power of 15 dBm or the minimum power required for reliable communication, whichever is less.

2. **Multiple Occupied Channels**:
   - **Adjacent Channel (i=1) Occupied with -60 dBm and Next Channel (i=2) Occupied with -85 dBm**:
     - The detected power in the adjacent channel would permit an EIRP of 20 dBm, but the transmitted power is limited by the lower power in channel \( i = 2 \) (0 dBm EIRP) or the minimum power required for reliable communication, whichever is less.

### Protection for Broadcasters

**A. Proposed Spectrum Sensing Approach**
The Coalition proposes a spectrum sensing approach that ensures broadcasters receive the necessary protection. Several comments have raised objections to the widespread use of white spaces, often assuming higher power fixed operations. The Coalition addresses these concerns and encourages the Commission to test prototype devices to address any legitimate issues.

1. **Detection Threshold for Co-Channel Interference**:
   - The Coalition proposed a detection threshold of -114 dBm, which is 30 dB below the TOV (Threshold of Visibility) for DTV signals. This ensures that incumbent licensees are protected.
   - Broadcasters' concerns about weak but protected TV signals are addressed by noting that interference protection is based on the impact on viewable pictures, not just location.

2. **Personal/Portable Devices in Adjacent Channels**:
   - The Coalition notes that personal/portable devices can successfully operate in adjacent channels, with TPC significantly reducing radiated power and the risk of interference.
   - MSTV’s data and arguments are unpersuasive, as they do not account for TPC and use inappropriate propagation models.

3. **Low Power Television Stations**:
   - The Coalition’s algorithm will provide interference protection for Class A, TV translator, and other low power stations, both analog and digital, within their Grade A contours.

### Testing
The Coalition supports the Commission’s commitment to objective testing to determine the appropriate parameters for device operation in TV white spaces. The Coalition urges the Commission to conduct fair and impartial testing and to reject requests for public inspection of prototypes, which could compromise confidential information.

### Authorization of Personal/Portable Devices
The Coalition urges the Commission not to delay the introduction of personal/portable devices and to authorize them at the same time as fixed devices, if not before.
