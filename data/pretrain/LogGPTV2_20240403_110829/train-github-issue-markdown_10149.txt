If I take away the minWidth from a select control, I expect the width to
adjust to the currently selected option. This works perfectly on Chrome on my
Mac. However it shows truncated text with ellipses on Safari as well as on
mobile browsers.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Here's the expected behavior which is what I get on Chrome. This is after
removing `minWidth: 120` from the Select example:

## Current Behavior
Here's the current behavior in Safari and several mobile browsers:

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
In the SimpleSelect example, remove minWidth:
      formControl: {
        margin: theme.spacing.unit,
        // minWidth: 120,
      },
Change some of the options to be super long to exaggerate the problem:
    Ten
    Twenty
    Three Hundred and twenty
## Context
I am trying to pack 3 select controls in a mobile app horizontally. Having
them autosize makes the best use of space and shows all the selected options
without ellipses. If I have to specify minWidths, it will not make the best
use of the available space.
