##### Detailed description
The stereo_match.cpp code
(https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/cpp/stereo_match.cpp)
has a scaling issue that took me 2 days to track down. The computed disparity
is a signed int16, and is scaled by a factor of 16 compared to the true
disparity, as per the documentation. The disparity thus must be converted to
float and divided by 16.0 before invoking reprojectImageTo3D(). As it is now,
since this division is not done, the result of reprojectImageTo3D() is wrong,
as is at 1/16-the the scale.
Suggested fix:
    Mat float_disp;
    disp.convertTo(float_disp, CV_32F, 1.0f/16.0f);
    reprojectImageTo3D(float_disp, xyz, Q, true);
