User: (centos6.6) before updating python2.7.3 ,it is python 2.6.6. When running pybot --version, errors came out as follows.
I want to install the test environment of python 2.7.3 and robot framework 2.7.6 and paramiko-1.7.4 and pycrypto-2.6

[root@localhost robotframework-2.7.6]# pybot --version
  Traceback (most recent call last):

Assistant: Reasons could be any of the following:

Either the python files (at least one) have lost the formatting. Python is prone to formatting errors
At least one installation (python, Robo) doesn't have administrative privileges.
Environment variables (PATH, CLASSPATH, PYTHON PATH) are not set fine.
What does python --version print? If this throws errors, installation has issues.
