### Issue Description

On a CentOS 6.6 system, I encountered an error when running `pybot --version` after updating Python from version 2.6.6 to 2.7.3. The goal is to set up a test environment with Python 2.7.3, Robot Framework 2.7.6, Paramiko 1.7.4, and pycrypto 2.6.

### Error Output

```bash
[root@localhost robotframework-2.7.6]# pybot --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pybot", line 4, in <module>
    from robot import run_cli

    import zlib
ImportError: No module named zlib
```

### Possible Causes

1. **Formatting Issues**: One or more Python files may have lost their formatting, which can cause syntax errors.
2. **Permissions**: The Python or Robot Framework installation may not have the necessary administrative privileges.
3. **Environment Variables**: The environment variables (e.g., `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`) may not be set correctly.
4. **Python Version**: Verify the Python version by running `python --version`. If this command throws an error, it indicates that the Python installation is not correct.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Check Python Installation**:
   - Run `python --version` to ensure that Python 2.7.3 is correctly installed and accessible.
   - If there are issues, reinstall Python 2.7.3.

2. **Install Missing Modules**:
   - The error indicates that the `zlib` module is missing. Install it using the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install zlib-devel
     ```

3. **Reinstall Python and Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed. You can use `pip` to install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install robotframework==2.7.6 paramiko==1.7.4 pycrypto==2.6
     ```

4. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure that the `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variables are set correctly. Add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:
     ```bash
     export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
     export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
     ```
   - Reload the shell configuration:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

5. **Check Permissions**:
   - Ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the Python and Robot Framework installations. You may need to use `sudo` for some commands.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError: No module named zlib` and successfully set up the desired test environment.
