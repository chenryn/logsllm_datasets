users are correct to not lock their devices because the effort to do
so would far exceed the value of the data being protected. Taken
as a whole, the time spent unlocking a smartphone is likely non-
trivial. For instance, Harbach et al. empirically showed that in 27
days, their participants spent an average of over an hour each just
unlocking their devices [21].
Locking one’s device may not be a one-size-ﬁts-all security prac-
tice. That is, while many users are likely to beneﬁt from the prac-
tice, this may not be universal. Instead, systems need to be designed
to accommodate some amount of nuance with regard to security
policies, weighing user needs with risks.
6.4 Limitations
Like all human subjects experiments, our participants were lim-
ited to those willing to participate. While the demographics from
our online samples were representative of the U.S. Internet-using
population, we did notice that our interview sample had a deﬁcit
of highly skilled professionals. None of our interview participants
reported storing sensitive work-related documents on their smart-
phones. We suspect that this may have had an effect on the gen-
eralizability of our results. For instance, doctors, lawyers, and
tech workers might have more sensitive information stored on their
smartphones and email accounts (and may or may not take addi-
tional precautions to protect that information). However, we be-
lieve that any bias here is limited, as highly skilled professionals
make up a small proportion of the total population.
Likewise, we also observed that few of our interview participants
were parents. We suspect that parents would be likely to have pho-
tographs or other sensitive information about their children on their
devices, and might therefore have greater concerns about a stranger
accessing such photographs or information on a stolen smartphone.
Our interviews and online survey relied on self-reported data.
The email search task was self-reported because we could not eth-
ically inspect the email accounts of others in order to measure the
prevalence of sensitive information. We designed this experiment
so that the same incentive was provided regardless of outcome, and
therefore we believe that if there was a bias, it was in favor of under-
reporting. Thus, we believe that the numbers we report on risks are
likely lower bounds.
6.5 Conclusions
We examined why smartphone users choose or choose not to use
a security lock on their phones. We followed this study up with an
online survey to examine how our results generalize to the larger
U.S. population. We observed that all of our participants use their
devices to check their email accounts, regardless of whether or not
they choose to lock their devices, and so we performed another on-
line experiment to quantify the frequency with which sensitive in-
formation could be obtained via an email account. Based on these
experiments, we offered design suggestions to help platforms in-
crease the number of users who use a security lock on their smart-
phones and to better communicate some of these risks to end users.
However, we believe that future work is still needed to validate
these suggestions.

Do you own a smartphone?
Have you been using it for at least 6 months?
If you answered “yes” to both questions, then you may be eligible
to participate in a study that looks at how people use smartphones!
The study involves meeting a UC Berkeley researcher for an inter-
view in a public place (i.e., a Starbuck’s near the Berkeley BART).
During the interview, you’ll answer questions about the apps you
have installed on your phone, the activities you typically use your
phone for, and how you use various features on your phone.
The interview will take less than an hour. Participants will receive
a $35 Visa gift card for participating in the study.
To be eligible for this study, you must:
-Be over 18
-Have owned a smartphone for at least 6 months
