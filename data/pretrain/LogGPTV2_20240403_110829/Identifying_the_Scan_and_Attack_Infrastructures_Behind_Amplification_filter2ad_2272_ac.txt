well as attribution results for diﬀerent levels of conﬁdence.
Since the QOTD and MSSQL protocols only account for a neg-
ligible number of attacks (1368, ≈ 0.1%), we will omit these
protocols in the following.
5.3.1 Attributable Attacks
Most notably, out of the 1,351,852 attacks that we recorded
at our honeypot, 785,285 (58.09%) could be attributed to a
single scanner with a conﬁdence of 99.9% or higher. This
means that the chance that the attack was not based on the
attributed scanner is less than 1 in 1,000. In fact, 643,956 at-
tacks (47.64%) even have a conﬁdence of 99.999% or higher,
i.e., the chance of a false attribution is less than 1 in 100,000.
Surprisingly, our results are not homogeneous among dif-
ferent protocols. This can be seen in Figure 4, which depicts
the fraction of attacks that could be attributed for various
levels of conﬁdence. While 74.70% of all CharGen attacks
could be attributed with a conﬁdence of 99.9% or higher,
this holds for only 10.20% of the SSDP-based attacks. This
discrepancy stems from the fact that the number of honey-
pot IPs used strongly varies between protocols, as can be
seen in Figure 3, which shows the distribution of honeypot
IPs used for all protocols. SSDP attacks only use 9.38 IPs on
average, whereas CharGen attacks use 20.66. Consequently,
SSDP also experiences a higher percentage of attacks marked
as non-unique. These discrepancies can be explained by the
global number of ampliﬁers available on the internet. For
example, Rossow found 3,704,000 servers vulnerable to be
used as SSDP ampliﬁers, in contrast to only 89,000 for Char-
Gen [26].
In other words, our honeypots are less likely to
be abused as ampliﬁers for SSDP-based attacks due to the
abundance of available alternative SSDP ampliﬁers.

Table 2: Attribution results and conﬁdence breakdown
Figure 3: Number of abused honeypots per protocol
attributable. This indicates that our initial assumption, i.e.,
that most attackers use the result of only a single scanner,
is true, as otherwise we would expect to see a much higher
number of attacks without a matching scanner. However,
of these few non-attributable attacks, more than 60% use
more than 24 IPs, the maximum number of ampliﬁers a
single scanner could have possibly found.
For these attacks that use more than 24 IPs, we can fur-
ther analyze whether they are aggressive scans that exceeded
the conservative threshold and are therefore counted as at-
tacks, or whether they are based on the result of multiple
scanners. Towards this goal we have to answer the following
question: What is the probability of ﬁnding x distinct IPs
when combining the results of y scans? Intuitively, while
it is possible to receive answers from all 48 honeypots with
just two scans, it is very unlikely, as this would mean that
the second scanner received answers from exactly those 24
honeypots that did not answer the ﬁrst scanner. That is, the
likelihood for ﬁnding a larger number of x IPs for multiple
scanners y increases with y and decreases with x. Formally,
this can be modeled as an instance of the collector’s problem
with group drawings [38]. In our case, we ﬁnd that for 80%
of the attacks using more than 24 IPs, the corresponding
attack sets can be found with a probability of over 60% by
combining the results of only two scans. This explains the
non-attributable cases in our data set. Rather than being
aggressive scans, we conclude that most non-attributable at-
tacks have combined data of multiple scanners.
5.3.3 Non-Unique Attacks
Finally, for 237,772 attacks (17.59%), our method found
more than one potential scanner, i.e., multiple scanners got
replies from the corresponding ampliﬁer set, labeling those
attacks as non-unique. Intuitively, this can only happen for
attacks that use a relatively small ampliﬁer set. Indeed, the
Figure 4: Percentage of attacks that could be at-
tributed (y-axis) vs. level of conﬁdence (x-axis)
average ampliﬁer set size of non-unique attacks is 6.25, i.e.,
about a fourth of the full response set a scanner could ﬁnd.
In addition, more than 12.88% of the non-unique attacks
have abused a single honeypot only.
5.4 Improving Attribution Conﬁdence
While we attributed a substantial fraction of all attacks to
their scanners with reasonable conﬁdence, for roughly 40%
we either found multiple potential scanners or could only at-
tribute the attack to a scan with low conﬁdence. A question
that naturally arises is whether this is a inherent limita-
tion of our methodology, or whether it can be alleviated by
choosing diﬀerent parameters, e.g., adjusting the response
ratio or leveraging a larger network segment.
To this end, we analyze the inﬂuence of the network size
and response ratio on the probability that the response set
of a scanner is a superset of the attack set. Let N be the
size of the network, α the response ratio, and A the attack
set. Similar to Section 5.2, the probability that a scanner
received replies from all IPs in the attack set is
p = Pr [A ⊆ R | A ⊆ Q] =
Since the conﬁdence is computed as (1 − p)S, in order to
improve the attribution conﬁdence, this probability should
be as low as possible.

Figure 6: Optimal response ratio α for β
Furthermore, this seems to imply that α should be chosen to
be very small. However, this is only true if |A| was indepent
of N and α. Obviously, the choice of α limits the number of
IPs a single scanner can ﬁnd by |A| ≤ αN for single scanners.
We therefore analyzed the impact of our network size on
the number of chosen IPs in attacks, i.e., the relation be-
tween |A| and αN . To this end, we computed the distri-
bution of attack sizes, simulating diﬀerent network sizes by
restricting our dataset to subnets.
We exploited the fact that our data was collected over
three /28 networks by performing this analysis three times:
using data from just a single subnet (16 IPs, 8 responses),
using data from two subnets (32 IPs, 16 responses), and
using data from all three subnets (48 IPs, 24 responses).
Restricting the data on a subnet level ensures that the re-
sponse ratio remains constant, e.g., in the case of 16 IPs, all
scanners that scan the entire network will see 8 responses. If
we had restricted the data to 16 random IPs, some scanners
might have received 0 responses, while others might have
received 16.
Figure 5 shows that the size of the attack sets correlates
with the network size. Although our data is too sparse to
make strong claims, data suggests that the relation between
|A| and αN is linear, with diﬀerent slopes per protocol.
Assuming a linear relation |A| = βαN , where β is the
protocol-speciﬁc slope, we could further investigate the choice
of α: We can rewrite the probability from above as
Pr [A ⊆ R | A ⊆ Q] =
=

,
which, for β ∈ (0, 1) and ﬁxed N , has a global minimum at
(cid:16)
α =
(1 − β)1−1/β + β
(cid:17)−1
.
Interestingly, the optimal response ratio is independent of
the network size, and dependent only on β. Figure 6 shows
the optimal value of α for β ∈ (0, 1). Counter to intuition,
to improve conﬁdence in the case of small attack sets, i.e.,
small β, one should also choose a lower response ratio α.
In other words, the gain in conﬁdence by reducing the re-
sponse ratio α outweighs the gain obtained by increasing the
size of attack sets |A| due to α. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that
Figure 7: Percentage of attributed attacks (y-axis)
vs. number of scanners (x-axis, log scale)
the above probability is dominated by the term N ! in the
denominator, and thus increasing the network size N also
leads to a dramatic increase in conﬁdence.
5.5 A Closer Look at Scanners
After uncovering the scanners providing the reconnais-
sance behind the attacks, we analyzed the scanners we found
in more detail. To this end, we will focus on the 785,285 at-
tacks we could link back to scanners with at least 99.9%
conﬁdence. Unless stated otherwise, percentages given in
this subsection will be relative to this set of attacks.
5.5.1 Attacks vs. Scanners
Interestingly, the 785,285 attacks are based on just 286 dif-
ferent scanners. Furthermore, the number of linked attacks
strongly varies per scanner. Figure 7 depicts the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) over those attacks against scan-
ners. As can be seen, a small number of scanners provided
the ampliﬁer sets for the majority of attacks. In the case of
NTP, 90% of the attacks are based on the scans of less than 20
scanners. For CharGen, almost the same fraction of attacks
is based only on the ampliﬁer set found by a single scanner.
This means that a single scanner provided the data for more
than 13% of all attacks that our honeypot recorded.
Surprisingly, the cross-protocol share of scanners is quite
large, i.e., scanners search for ampliﬁers of multiple proto-
cols. About a quarter of the scanners (26%) scanned and

In the following, we therefore answer whether attackers ac-
tually reuse their scan infrastructure for launching attacks.
6.1 Methodology
In a DDoS ampliﬁcation attack, the attacker sends out
requests to a set of ampliﬁers, but spoofs the packet header
to inject the victim’s IP address. Therefore, from the am-
pliﬁer’s perspective, packets observed during an attack will
only contain the IP address of the victim. Worse, the vic-
tim will only see that traﬃc is originating from ampliﬁers.
Finding the actual packet source of ampliﬁcation attack is
thus a non-trivial problem—irrespective of the perspective.
To tackle this problem, we propose to combine our hon-
eypot data with trilateration techniques to trace back the
