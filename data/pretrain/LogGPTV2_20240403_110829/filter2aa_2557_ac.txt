Time-shifting and Streaming Media 
As more consumers receive audio and video content 
from “streaming” Internet media sources, they will 
demand tools to preserve their settled fair use 
expectations, including the ability to “time-shift” 
programming for later listening or viewing. As a result 
of the DMCA, however, the digital equivalents of 
VCRs and cassette decks for streaming media may 
never arrive. 
Start-up software company Streambox developed 
exactly such a product, known simply as the Streambox 
VCR, designed to time-shift streaming media. When 
competitor RealNetworks discovered that Streambox 
had developed a competing streaming media player, it 
invoked the DMCA and obtained an injunction against 
the Streambox VCR product.  
RealNetworks, Inc. v. Streambox, Inc., 2000 WL 
127311 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 18, 2000). 
The DMCA has also been invoked to threaten the 
developer of an open source, noncommercial software 
application  known as Streamripper that records MP3 
audio streams for later listening.

embed and Fonts 
In January 2002, typeface vendor Agfa Monotype 
Corporation threatened a college student with DMCA 
liability for creating “embed,” a free, open source, 
noncommercial 
software 
program 
designed 
to 
manipulate TrueType fonts.  
According to the student: “I wrote embed in 1997, 
after discovering that all of my fonts disallowed 
embedding in documents. Since my fonts are free, this 
was silly—but I didn't want to take the time to… 
change the flag, and then reset all of the extended font 
properties with a separate program. What a bore! 
Instead, I wrote this program to convert all of my fonts 
at once. The program is very simple; it just requires 
setting a few bits to zero. Indeed, I noticed that other 
fonts that were licensed for unlimited distribution also 
disallowed embedding…. So, I put this program on the 
web in hopes that it would help other font developers 
as well.” 
 Agfa Monotype nevertheless threatened the student 
author with DMCA liability for distributing the 
program. According to Agfa, the fact that embed can 
be used to allow distribution of protected fonts makes 
it contraband under Section 1201, notwithstanding the 
fact that the tool has many legitimate uses in the hands 
of hobbyist font developers.

Unintended Consequences: Four Years Under the DMCA

5. A threat to innovation and competition 
The DMCA is being used to hinder the efforts of 
legitimate competitors to create interoperable products.  
For example, Vivendi-Universal's Blizzard video 
game division invoked the DMCA in an effort to 
intimidate the developers of a software product derived 
from legitimate reverse engineering. Sony has used the 
DMCA to threaten hobbyists who created competing 
software for Sony’s Aibo robot dog, as well as to sue 
makers of software that permits the playing of 
Playstation games on PCs. In each of these cases, the 
DMCA was used to deter a marketplace competitor, 
rather than to battle piracy. 
Lexmark Sues Over Toner Cartridges 
Lexmark, the second-largest printer vendor in the 
U.S., has long tried to eliminate aftermarket laser 
printer toner vendors that offer consumers toner 
cartridges at prices below Lexmark’s. In December 
2002, Lexmark invoked the DMCA in its effort to 
eliminate competition in this market, suing Static 
Control Components for “circumvention” of certain 
“authentication routines” between Lexmark toner 
cartridges and printers.  
Lexmark 
added 
these 
authentication 
routines 
explicitly to hinder aftermarket toner vendors. Static 
Control reverse-engineered these measures and now 
sells “Smartek” chips that enable aftermarket cartridges 
to work in Lexmark printers. Lexmark claims that these 
chips are “circumvention devices” banned by the 
DMCA. Whatever the merits of Lexmark’s position, it 
is fair to say that eliminating the laser printer toner 
aftermarket was not what Congress had in mind when 
enacting the DMCA.

Sony Sues Connectix and B eem 
l
Since the DMCA’s enactment in 1998, Sony has used 
DMCA litigation to pressure competitors who created 
software that would allow PC owners to play games 
intended for the Sony Playstation video game console. 
In 1999, Sony sued Connectix Corporation, the 
manufacturer of the Virtual Game Station, an emulator 
program which allowed Sony Playstation games to be 
played on Apple Macintosh computers. Sony also sued 
Bleem, the leading vendor of Playstation emulator 
software for Windows PCs.  
In both cases, the Sony competitors had created their 
products by engaging in legitimate reverse engineering, 
which has been recognized as noninfringing fair use in 
a series of Ninth Circuit cases. Connectix, in fact, 
ultimately won a Ninth Circuit ruling that its reverse 
engineering was indeed fair use.7 Both Connectix and 
Bleem, however, were unable to bear the high costs of 
litigation against Sony and ultimately were forced to 
pull their products off the market. Whatever the merits 
of Sony’s position may have been under copyright, 
trademark, patent, or other legal theories, the 
competitive efforts of Connectix and Bleem certainly 
were at a far remove from the “black box” piracy 
devices that Congress meant to target with section 
1201.

Sony Threatens Aibo Hobbyist 
Sony has also invoked the DMCA against a hobbyist 
who developed custom programs for Sony’s Aibo 
robotic “pet” dog. The hobbyist cracked the encryption 
surrounding the source code that manipulates the Aibo 
to reverse engineer programs that allow owners to 
customize voice recognition by their Aibos. The 
hobbyist revealed neither the decrypted source code 
nor the code he used to defeat the encryption, freely 
distributed his custom programs, and made no profit. 
Nevertheless, Sony claimed that the act of circum-
venting the encryption surrounding the source code 
violated the DMCA and demanded that the hobbyist 
remove his programs from his website.  
Responding to public outcry, Sony ultimately 
permitted the hobbyist to repost some of his programs 
(on the understanding that Sony will have the rights of 
commercial development in the programs). The 
incident, however, illustrated Sony’s willingness to 
invoke the DMCA in situations with no relationship to 
“piracy.”

Blizzard Sues bnetd.org  
Section 1201 has been invoked in a federal lawsuit by 
Vivendi-Universal's Blizzard Entertainment video game 
division against a group of volunteer game enthusiasts 
who used reverse engineering to create free and open 
source software to allow owners of Blizzard games to 
play the games over the Internet. The software, a server 
called "bnetd," provides an alternative to Blizzard's 
own Battle.net servers. 
Both Battle.net servers and bnedt servers are 
available for free and both allow owners of Blizzard 
games to play with each other across the Internet. The 
group of volunteers decided to create bnetd to 
overcome difficulties that they had experienced in 
attempting to use Battle.net. The bnetd software is 
freely distributed, open source, and non-commercial.  
Blizzard filed suit in St. Louis to bar distribution of 
bnetd, alleging that the software is a circumvention 
device that violates the DMCA. According to Blizzard, 
the bnetd software has been used by some to permit 
networked play of pirated Blizzard games. Whether or 
not that is true, the developers are not using the 
software for that purpose, nor was the software 
designed for that purpose. The software has numerous 
legitimate uses for owners of Blizzard games.  
Whatever else may be said about the bnetd software, it 
is plainly not a “black box” piracy device. (EFF is 
representing the bnetd developers.)

Sony Attacks Playstation “Mod Chips”  
Apart from using the DMCA against vendors of 
personal computer emulators of Sony’s Playstation, 
Sony has sued a number of manufacturers of so-called 
“mod chips” for alleged circumvention under the 
DMCA. In doing so, Sony has been able to enforce a 
system of geographical regional restrictions that raises 
significant anticompetitive issues.  
So-called “mod chips” are after-market accessories 
that modify Playstation consoles to permit games 
legitimately purchased in one part of the world to be 
played on a games console from another geographical 
region. Sony has sued mod chip manufacturers in the 
U.S., the U.K., and Australia. In the U.S.,  Sony sued 
Gamemasters, Inc., distributor of the Game Enhancer 
peripheral device, which allowed U.S. Playstation users 
to play games purchased in Japan and other countries.  
Although there was no infringement of Sony’s 
copyright, the court granted an injunction under the 
DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions, effectively 
banning the use of a technology that would permit 
users to use legitimately-purchased non-infringing 
games from other regions. 
Recognizing the anti-competitive potential of the 
region playback control system, an Australian court 
recently ruled against Sony in a case that was brought 
against an Australian mod chip manufacturer under the 
Australian 
equivalent 
of 
the 
DMCA’s 
anti-
circumvention provisions. 
Sony has argued that mod chips can also be used to 
enable the use of unauthorized copies of Playstation 
games. But most Playstation mod chips are not “black 
box” devices suitable only for piracy. The potential 
illegitimate uses must be weighed against legitimate 
uses, such as defeating Sony’s region coding system to 
play games purchased in other countries.

Apple Harasses Inventive Retailer 
When Other World Computing (OWC), a small 
retailer specializing in Apple Macintosh computers, 
developed a software patch that allowed all Mac 
owners to use Apple’s iDVD software, they thought 
they were doing Apple’s fans a favor. For their trouble, 
they got a DMCA threat from Apple. 
Apple’s iDVD authoring software was designed to 
work on newer Macs that shipped with internal DVD 
recorders manufactured by Apple. OWC discovered 
that a minor software modifiation would allow iDVD 
to work with external DVD recorders, giving owners of 
older Macs an upgrade path. Apple claimed that this 
constituted a violation of the DMCA and requested 
that OWC stop this practice immediately. OWC  
obliged.  
Rather than prevent copyright infringement, the 
DMCA empowered Apple to force consumers to buy 
new Mac computers instead of simply upgrading their 
older machines with an external DVD recorder.

6. Conclusion 
Four 
years 
of 
experience 
with 
the 
“anti-
circumvention” provisions of the DMCA demonstrate 
that the statute reaches too far, chilling a wide variety 
of legitimate activities in ways Congress did not intend. 
As an increasing number of copyright works are 
wrapped in technological protection measures, it is 
likely that the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions 
will be applied in further unforeseen contexts, 
hindering the legitimate activities of innovators, 
researchers, the press, and the public at large.
