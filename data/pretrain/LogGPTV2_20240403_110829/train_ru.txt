apologies if i missed anyone!
newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------
perf_event_open.2
    vince weaver
        add perf_ioc_flag_group documentation
            the perf_event_open() enable/disable/reset ioctls can take an
            argument, perf_ioc_flag_group.  this wasn't documented at all
            until about a year ago (despite the support being there from
            the beginning) so i missed this when initially writing
            the man page.
socket.7
    pavel emelyanov, michael kerrisk
        document so_peek_off option
            since linux 3.4 there appeared an ability to specify the
            offset in bytes from which the data will be msg_peek-ed.
            describe this socket option in the socket(7) page, where
            all the other socket options are described.
global changes
--------------
various pages

changes to individual pages
---------------------------
execve.2
    peter ladow
       add envp to the linux notes about null pointers
            during the review of static analysis results, we discovered a
            functional, but non-portable, use of execve().  for example:
                char *cmd[] = { "/path/to/some/file", null };
                execve(cmd[0], cmd, null);
            the call succeeds.  yet, the static analysis tool (rightly)
            pointed out that envp could be dereferenced.  but digging into
            glibc and the kernel, it appears that like argv, envp when null
            is treated as if it were an empty list.
            so, to clear things up, i'm submitting this patch to update the
            man page to indicate that envp is treated like argv.
fallocate.2
    michael kerrisk
        return value: mention that 'errno' is set on error
io_setup.2
    cyril hrubis  [jeff moyer]
        clarify the nr_events parameter
            currently the io_setup.2 man page describes what the kernel really
            does, i.e., that the resulting context may be able to hold more
            than the 'nr_event's operations because the memory allocated in
            kernel is rounded to be multiple of page size.
            it is better not to expose this implementation detail and
            simply state that the resulting context is suitable for
            'nr_events' operations.
perf_event_open.2
    vince weaver
        clarify the perf_event_open() wakeup_events/wakeup_watermark fields
            clarify the perf_event_open() wakeup_events/wakeup_watermark
            fields a bit, based on info from kernel commit cfeb1d90a1b1.
    vince weaver
        update to match the linux 3.10 release
            this patch updates the perf_event_open() documentation to include
            new interfaces added in the 3.10 kernel.
            it also documents a few [to be documented] instances left over
            from the 3.7 kernel.
    vince weaver
        small correction to description of 'flags' argument
prctl.2
    michael kerrisk

            attribute.

    adrian bunk
        correct information on getting non-inlined version with gcc+glibc
