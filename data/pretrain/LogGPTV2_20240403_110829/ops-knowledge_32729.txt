Question: "You are developing a web application that includes a third-party JavaScript library hosted on a CDN. To ensure the integrity of the script being loaded, which technique would be most effective and why?"
 "A": "Implement Subresource Integrity by adding an integrity attribute to the script tag, which will provide a hash of the expected script content."
 "B": "Include the script via an iframe to isolate it from the main page, thus preventing any possible malicious code from accessing your page's data."
 "C": "Use a CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *' on your server to ensure that the script is loaded securely from the CDN."
 "D": "Rely on the Same-Origin Policy of the browser to automatically prevent the loading of scripts that do not match the site's origin."
Answer: A
