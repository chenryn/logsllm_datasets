ABSTRACT 
The fourth ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD) is 
held in Dallas, Texas, USA on October 30, 2017, co-located with 
the  24th  ACM  Conference  on  Computer  and  Communications 
Security (CCS). The main objective of the workshop is to discuss 
novel  randomization,  diversification,  and  dynamism  techniques 
for  computer  systems  and  networks,  new  metric  and  analysis 
frameworks to assess and quantify the effectiveness of MTD, and 
discuss challenges and opportunities that such defenses provide. 
We  have  constructed  an  exciting  and  diverse  program  of  nine 
refereed papers and two invited keynote talks that will provide 
the participant with a vibrant and thought-provoking set of ideas 
and insights.

1  INTRODUCTION 
The static nature of current computing systems has made them 
easy  to  attack  and  hard  to  defend.  Adversaries  have  an 
asymmetric  advantage  in  that  they  have  the  time  to  study  a 
system, identify its vulnerabilities, and choose the time and place 
of  attack  to  gain  the  maximum  benefit.  The  idea  of  moving-
target  defense  (MTD)  is  to  impose  the  same  asymmetric 
disadvantage  on  attackers  by  making  systems  dynamic  and 
therefore harder to explore and predict [1, 2]. With a constantly

changing system and its ever adapting attack surface, attackers 
will  have  to  deal  with  a  great  amount  of  uncertainty  just  like 
defenders do today. The ultimate goal of MTD is to increase the 
attackers’ workload so as to level the cybersecurity playing field 
for  both  defenders  and  attackers  -  hopefully  even  tilting  it  in 
favor of the defender. 
The  MTD’2017  workshop  aims  to  provide  a  forum  for 
researchers and practitioners in this area to exchange their novel 
ideas, findings, experiences, and lessons learned. 
System randomization 
Software diversity 
2  SCOPE 
Randomization, diversification, and dynamism can be applied to 
many  different  components  of  a  computer  system/network  and 
to  different  layers  of  its  software  stack  [3].  As  a  result,  MTD 
covers  a  broad  spectrum  of  techniques  and  their  associated 
metrics and analysis frameworks. 
Topics of interest include, but not limited to: 
  Artificial diversity 
  Cyber maneuver and agility 
  Dynamic network configuration 
  Moving target in the cloud 
System diversification techniques 
  Dynamic compilation techniques 
  Adaptive defenses 
  MTD quantification methods and models 
  MTD evaluation and assessment frameworks 
  MTD analytics 
  Moving target in software coding and application API  
  Autonomous technologies for MTD 
  Human, social, and usability aspects of MTD 
  Other related areas 
Theoretical studies on trade-offs of MTD approaches 
Large-scale MTD (using multiple techniques)

professor of Computer Science and Engineering at University of 
South Florida. He received his PhD from Princeton University in 
2005.  Before  joining  USF  in  fall  2015,  he  had  been  a  faculty 
member at Kansas State University since 2006. Dr. Ou's research 
is  primarily  in  cyber  defense  technologies,  with  focuses  on 
human-centered approach to addressing this challenge problem. 
He also has broad interest and on-going work in cyber-physical 
system  security, 
intrusion/forensics  analysis,  moving-target 
defense,  and  mobile  system  security.  He  is  the  author  of  the
