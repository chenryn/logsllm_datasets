User: How to use Docker Compose to manage multiple containers, including building, starting, shutting down and deleting containers?
Assistant: Docker Compose is a very convenient tool that can help us centrally manage multiple containers, including operations such as building, starting, shutting down, and deleting containers. The following are the steps to use Docker Compose to manage multiple containers: 1. Install Docker Compose First, you need to install Docker Compose. The official website provides detailed installation instructions. 2. Create a *Docker Compose* file In the project root directory, create a file named `docker-compose.yml`. This file defines the containers that need to be created and the relationships between containers. For example: ``` version: '3' services: web: build: . ports: - "5000:5000" volumes: - .:/code depends_on: - redis redis: image: "redis:alpine" ``` this file Two services (web and redis) are defined, and the web service will use the Dockerfile to build the image. At the same time, a dependency relationship is established between web and redis, that is, the redis service needs to be started before the web service can be started. 3. Start the container In the root directory of the project, use the following command to start all the containers: ``` docker-compose up ``` This command will build all the images that need to be built, and then run all the containers. If you want to run the container in the background, you can use the `-d` or `--detach` option. ``` docker-compose up -d ``` 4. Stop the container In the project root directory, use the following command to stop all containers: ``` docker-compose down ``` This command will stop and delete all containers. 5. Other operations Docker Compose also provides some other operations, such as: - `docker-compose ps` View container status - `docker-compose logs` View container logs - `docker-compose restart` Restart container - `docker-compose build ` Only build the image, do not run the container. These operations can be used as needed in normal use. The above are the steps to use Docker Compose to manage multiple containers. With the help of Docker Compose, we can manage and deploy multiple container applications more easily and efficiently.
