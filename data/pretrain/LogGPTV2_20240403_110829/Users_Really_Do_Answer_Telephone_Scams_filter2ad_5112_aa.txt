Abstract
As telephone scams become increasingly prevalent, it is cru-
cial to understand what causes recipients to fall victim to
these scams. Armed with this knowledge, effective counter-
measures can be developed to challenge the key foundations
of successful telephone phishing attacks.
In this paper, we present the methodology, design, execu-
tion, results, and evaluation of an ethical telephone phishing
scam. The study performed 10 telephone phishing experi-
ments on 3,000 university participants without prior aware-
ness over the course of a workweek. Overall, we were able to
identify at least one key factor—spoofed Caller ID—that had
a signiﬁcant effect in tricking the victims into revealing their
Social Security number.
1 Introduction
The rise of telephone spam, scams, fraud, phishing, or vish-
ing, is a signiﬁcant and growing problem. According to FTC
reports for 2018, phone impersonation scams have increased
signiﬁcantly in the recent years. The national Do-Not-Call
Registry received more than 5.78 million unwanted call com-
plaints [1], with fraud and imposer scam in the top spots and
more than 69% of all reported frauds were attempted over the
phone [2].
With the growing dissatisfaction of telephone scams, how-
ever, little research has been done to study why people fall for
telephone scams and how to combat the problem. In this paper,
inspired by the work of Tischer et al. [3] on USB drives, we
present the results of an empirical telephone phishing study,
designed to systematically measure different attributes in re-
lation to the success rate of telephone scams. Although the
current understanding of telephone scams might be accepted
as conventional wisdom, no prior work has speciﬁcally vali-
dated such claims with a systematic study. From this study,
we hope to dispel some myths about what is “scammy” and
what is not. With the understanding of the key attributes that
make a scam convincing, the research community can focus
on developing prevention methods to challenge the fundamen-
tals of telephone phishing attacks. The key takeaway from
this study is that caller ID spooﬁng is an incredibly effective
feature in telephone scams, and, therefore, authenticated caller
ID [4, 5] is likely to be an important countermeasure.
The main contributions of this paper are the following:
• We describe a systematic approach to test the signiﬁ-
cance of various telephone phishing scam attributes and
conduct an empirical study.
• We present our evaluation of the phishing study and pro-
vide our recommendations for combating the telephone
phishing problem.
2 Background
With the emergence of distribution technology, decreasing
economic cost, high reachability, and automation, the tele-
phone has become an attractive medium for disseminating
unsolicited information. As with any form of spam, there are
three key ingredients: the recipient list, the content, and the
distribution channel [6]. Telephone scams rely on distributing
deceitful voice content, whereas telephone spam or telemar-
keting primarily distributes marketing and advertising content.
In telephone scams, fraud, phishing, or vishing, the goal of
the voice content is to trick the human victim into performing
harmful actions for the beneﬁt of the attacker (while other
types of fraud are possible on telephone networks [7–9]).
Compared to other forms of phishing, such as email and
website phishing [10–15], telephone phishing differs by hav-
ing the potential to make the scam more convincing by falsify-
ing both visual and auditory perceptions to induce the victims
into falling for the scam. Visually, the scam can be made
more convincing by altering the caller ID, such as by spooﬁng
the caller ID, manipulating the area code (e.g., in “neighbor
spooﬁng” attacks [16]), and impersonating a familiar contact
name. Once the recipient has answered the call, the attacker
then switches to using deceitful voice content to exploit the
human recipient [17,18]. Within the voice content, an attacker
can spoof or duplicate the speech from a known organization

or a familiar personal contact. To provide a motivation for the
recipient to divulge conﬁdential or personal information, the
scammer can present a demanding scenario that forces the
victim to divulge sensitive information.
By looking at telephone phishing from a perspective that
can be characterized by the visual and voice attributes which
it embodies, a systematic approach can be used to study and
understand why some scams work better than others. Under-
standing why telephone phishing works can help us design
solutions that challenge the core foundations of telephone
scams.
3 Study Design
The goal of the study is to design a systematic approach that
can reveal the effective factors in telephone scams by con-
ducting our own telephone phishing scam. Our approach to
designing the study is to ﬁrst identify the attributes that could
lead to an effective telephone phishing scam. After that, we
design a set of experiments and procedures that allow compar-
ison of different variations of an attribute. Each experiment
followed a standardized procedure that was conducted on
each group simultaneously (all calls were distributed in a
randomized order throughout the experiment). Finally, we
provide a discussion on what could be learned from the anal-
ysis and provide our recommended solutions for combating
the telephone phishing problem. The study was conducted
with signiﬁcant ethical consideration and with IRB approval
(see Section 3.5 for an in-depth discussion of ethics).
3.1 Attributes
To identify the telephone scam attributes, we gathered and
reviewed more than 150 existing real-world telephone scam
samples from various Internet sources, including the FTC
website, IRS website, news websites, YouTube, SoundCloud,
user comments, and industry surveys. While reviewing the
scams, we identiﬁed the following attributes used in telephone
scams:
Area Code: In North America, the area code is the ﬁrst three
digits on the caller ID. The area code speciﬁes the geographic
location associated with the caller’s phone number, e.g., 202 is
associated with Washington, DC. In addition, a toll-free phone
number is also identiﬁed by the three-digit preﬁx similar to a
geographic area code, e.g., 800, 888, 877, etc. According to
reports of real-world IRS impersonation scams [19,20], many
scammers appeared to have either spoofed or obtained a 202
area code or toll-free area code on their caller IDs to make
it appear as if the IRS is calling. To test the hypothesis that
the area code could effect telephone phishing success, in our
experiments we varied the caller ID area code between: 202
(Washington, DC), 800 (Toll-free), and 480 (local area code
of the university location).
Caller Name: Today, most telephone terminals have the ca-
pability of associating a name with a telephone number. With
a stored contact, an incoming call from the stored contact
would show the name associated with the caller ID. To per-
form a spear phishing attack [21,22], a malicious caller could
spoof the caller ID of a known stored contact. A known stored
contact can be identiﬁed for an organization by studying the
publicly available phone numbers or for an individual by man-
ually analyzing social network information. For legal, ethical,
and IRB approval reasons, we did not actually spoof a known
caller name. Instead, we asked our telephone service depart-
ment to temporarily create a new contact in the university’s
internal phone directory and associated a legitimate sounding
name with the telephone number. We used that telephone
number in our scam experiments to produce a similar effect
to caller name spooﬁng.
Voice Production: According to reports of real-world tele-
phone scams, some used a robotic (synthesized) voice, while
others used a pre-recorded human voice [20, 23]. To test the
effect of synthesized voices vs. human voices, we recreated
known scams using a text-to-speech synthesizer to generate
a speech similar to the real-world scams. To mimic the hu-
man voice version of the scams, we recorded human voices
speaking the exact same announcement message.
Gender: From listening to recordings of actual telephone
scams, some used a male voice, and some used a female voice.
To test if the vocal gender of the voice could have an effect
on the telephone scam, we varied the voice gender between
male and female in the text-to-speech synthesizer.
Accent: From the reports of telephone scams, some spoke
with an Indian accent, and some others spoke with an Ameri-
can accent. It seems possible that recipients would be more
wary of scams that speak in a foreign accent, and would be
less suspicious of scams that speak in an American accent. To
test if this could have an effect on the telephone scam, we var-
ied the recorded voice accent between Indian and American
in our experiments.
Entity: From gathering real-world telephone scams, two
types of scams stood out in terms of the number of re-
ports: IRS impersonation scams [24] and HR impersonation
scams [25]. In these scams, the scammer claimed to be from
the IRS or the company’s HR department. While the IRS
scams can affect any taxpayer in the US, the HR scams are
usually targeted toward people in a speciﬁc company. In-
tuitively, it seems that a more targeted attack would have
more success. Thus, we varied the impersonated entity of
our scams between the IRS and ASU’s HR department1. To
simulate the real-world HR scams as closely as possible, we
initially wanted to impersonate our university’s HR depart-
ment. However, our HR department had strong objections
about using their name to conduct the scam experiments. As
a compromise, our experiments claimed to be from a fake

study were work telephone numbers that are associated with
university staff and faculty. We decided on a population of
3,000 recipients (300 per experiment) for the study. To com-
pile the list of telephone numbers, we wrote a custom tool
to download the university’s internal phone directory. For a
real-world scammer, our university’s phone directory is also
publicly available for crawling.
To minimize selection bias, the telephone numbers were
randomly chosen from the university telephone directory, and
then the chosen contacts were randomly put into one of the
10 experiment groups. The sample selection procedure was
as follows: (1) Compile the list of work telephone numbers
associated with university staff and faculty, (2) remove tele-
phone numbers of people already aware of the study, and (3)
randomly assign 300 numbers to each of the 10 experiments.

but legitimate-sounding HR-like department called the “W-2
Administration”2.
Scenario: Real-world telephone scams create various scenar-
ios to motivate their victims to fall for the scam, such as tax
lawsuits, payroll issues, or credit card veriﬁcation. The type
of motivation are generally either fear-based or reward-based.
In our study, we crafted a fear-based and a reward-based sce-
nario related to each entity. These scenarios were inspired
by real-world IRS scams and HR scams. To test each type
of scenario, our message announcements varied between Tax
Lawsuit (IRS fear-based), Unclaimed Tax Return (IRS reward-
based), Payroll Withheld (HR fear-based), and Bonus Issued
(HR reward-based).
3.2 Experiments
To test these attributes, we designed the experiments such that
variations of each attribute can be compared under similar en-
vironmental conditions. When performing experiments under
the same environmental conditions, one of the design issues
is to decide whether to counterbalance the environmental con-
ditions such that all variations of background attributes are
tested. This would theoretically avoid possible interference
due to a speciﬁc set of background conditions.
However, performing a counterbalanced measures design
does not come without costs. Counterbalancing the conditions
is performed by splitting the experiments into groups of every
possible order of attribute conditions. Given the large number
of attributes that we have identiﬁed, and of each attribute with
2–4 variations that we have identiﬁed, would require us to
create 384 separate groups of experiments. This is unfeasi-
ble for an empirical study with real-world time and resource
constraints.
As a solution to this problem, instead of experimenting
with a large number of background conditions, we compare
variations of each attribute under a speciﬁc set of background
conditions that seem to be the most popular in the real world.
We decided on a standard background condition: a phishing
scam with area code 202, with no caller name, speaking in a
synthesized, male voice, in an American accent, impersonat-
ing the IRS, motivating the recipient with a tax lawsuit. The
set of 10 experiments and the variations of each attribute are
listed in Table 1.
3.3 Population
To comply with legal requirements [26], our own ethical con-
siderations, and our IRB (Section 3.5), we conducted exper-
iments on our university’s internal population (rather than
the general population). This population was unaware of our
study (and we discuss the ethical implications of this decep-
tive non-consent study in Section 3.5). The population of the

Several considerations went into the design of the proce-
dure. First, we need to ensure that the procedure is standard-
ized across all experiments, such that the results are directly
comparable to each other. Second, we need to ensure that
the process minimizes false positives and false negatives,
otherwise, the study results could be unreliable. Finally, the
