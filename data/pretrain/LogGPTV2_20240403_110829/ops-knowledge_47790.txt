Question: In a new smart home device architecture, several components including sensors, a central processing unit (CPU), and a smart hub, all communicate over a shared bus. Each sensor operates as a responder device and interfaces with the rest of the system through a fabric end-point. To enhance system security and prevent any single sensor from controlling bus transactions, which of the following measures should be implemented?
"A": "Hardcode the bus-control-enable bit in the fabric end-point register of each sensor to 1 to allow transaction control.",
"B": "Ensure that during the secure-boot process, the bus-control-enable bit in the fabric end-point register is set to 0 for all responder devices.",
"C": "Implement a firmware routine to verify and correct the bus-control-enable bit setting in all responder devices during runtime.",
"D": "Allow unrestricted writes to the bus-control-enable register to maintain flexibility in the system configuration."
