Linux/Moose ?
Linux/Moose
An IoT botnet that 
conducts social 
media 
manipulation
Social Media Manipulation 
The Ecosystem of Social 
Media Manipulation
Presentation is
about: 
•A four-year long 
investigation 
•Various
investigative
techniques 
•A mapping of all 
actors involved
•Affects routers / Internet of Things (IoT)
• Embedded Linux systems with busybox userland
•Worm-like behavior
• Telnet credential brute force
•Payload: Proxy service
• SOCKSv4/v5, HTTP, HTTPS
Linux/Moose 
Honeypots
• Software-based
• Low interaction
• Side-loaded an ARM
virtual machine
• Which we infected
HTTPS Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
Accessed the 
raw traffic! 
What did we have? 
•Several infected hosts actively used by 
operators
•HTTPS traffic in plaintext
•C&C traffic
•Publicly available seller market
Whitelisted IPs
Reseller model? 
Variables Honeypots used 
Websites targeted

Where do we stand?
•Fake accounts
•Pinned to a given honeypot
•Originate from a single whitelisted IP address
•Whitelisted IP addresses
•Runs on Windows servers
•RDP is actively used
Automation Software
• We tried to find the Linux/Moose provider
• Based on User-Agents: Mobile and Desktop
• Socks proxy support
• Found different features
• Proxy-type HTTP / Socks
• Per account User-Agents (Mobile and Desktop)
• Custom browsing patterns
• Found different business models
• Unlimited accounts
• One-time fee / Pay-per-month / Pay-per-account

Where do we stand?
Found several automation software vendors 
Reseller model is not at the 
botnet level
Found in the decrypted traffic
Reseller panels
•Sell popularity 
in bulk 
•All look alike

Reseller Panel Providers
All in one solution :
•Ready to go software 
•Provides web hosting
•Domain name

Features: 
•API to receive orders
•API to send orders
•Track your workers

Where do we stand? 
•A system of resellers and reseller panel providers
•Automation software to create and orchestrate 
fake accounts
Working around Blocks
• Automation software supports proxy lists

Shocking Business Model
Storm Proxies
• Received IPs from USA: 
Kansas City, Lincoln NE 
and Sunnyvale CA
• ISPs have conflicting 
information:
• Digital Energy 
Technologies Chile with 
Org Host1Plus
• Victoria Mahe with Org 
Joe's Datacenter, LLC
• Traceroute leads to the 
US
Storm Proxies (cont)
• Uses Squid for 
proxying
• Doesn’t protect scans 
to localhost
• Linux system
• Most likely Debian 
Jessie
• Exim 4.84_2
• Squid 3.4.8
RSocks
• Received IPs all 
from same subnet 
in Russia
• ISP: Adman LLC
• Traceroute 
confirms Russia
RSocks (cont)
• Exposes SSH on 3389 
• Doesn’t protect scans 
to localhost
• Unable to fingerprint 
proxy service
• Most likely Debian 
Jessie
• SSH banner deb8u7
Valar Solutions
• Received a single IP from 
France
• Scaleway, Dedibox
• Traffic goes out an IPv6 
address in the USA
• AT&T Internet Services
Valar (cont)
• Uses 3Proxy
• on 1067 non-continuous ports
• Identified by nmap
• Confirmed by error message 
strings that match source code
• Protects from localhost scans
• Both IPv4 and IPv6
• IPv6 sealed from outside
• Proxy entry is Debian 9
• Nginx + OpenSSH

Who buys from reseller panels? 
Potential Buyers
Linux/Moose
86% of the relayed traffic focused on Instagram 
List of potential customers: 
522 accounts
Method: 
Content analysis 
Entertainment Industry (20%)
Selling Products and Services (21%)
Personal Profiles (26%)
The Unexpected Ones 
The Fascinating Ones 
We made an experiment… 
Linux/Moose’s  Targeted Social Networks 
In 2016
$95
$22.5
Squirrel buys 10,000 followers on Instagram
 $1,000 a day at $22.5/10,000 follows
-> That is 45 orders of 10,000 follows 
-> 450,000 follows a day
-> 11 382 bots 
1 client = $365 000/year 
What to do 
next? 
Regulate the sale of social 
media manipulation
Policy makers: 
Target the middle-man 
Law enforcement:
Social networks:
Continue to increase the costs of creating 
fake likes and follows
Individuals (you)
Focus on the content rather 
than the container! 
What is this person bringing 
to society? Is this post legit? 
What are the sources? 
Thank you! Questions?
