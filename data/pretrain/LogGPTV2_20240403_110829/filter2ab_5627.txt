**Title: Botconf 2015 - Malware Instrumentation: Application to Regin Analysis**

The complexity of the Regin malware underscores the critical role of reverse engineering in modern incident response. This study demonstrates that such complexity can be effectively managed, yielding valuable insights into adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) through reverse engineering.

We provide an introduction to the Regin development framework, along with detailed instrumentation guidelines. These guidelines enable researchers to experiment with individual malware modules, allowing for direct utilization of the malware's own code without the need to develop a separate analysis toolkit.

As a practical application of this instrumentation approach, we analyze the underlying botnet architecture of Regin. Our findings are presented from multiple perspectives, including defense, attack, and counterintelligence, providing a comprehensive understanding of the malware's capabilities and implications.
