User: I am trying to import the OpenGL.GL module.
Given the py file with that line, I can perform "python file.py" just fine, but I cannot run that same file when used in Aptana or Eclipse. Both IDEs have PyDev installed.
I do have PyOpenGL installed.
I wish to point out that I can still import other modules (PIL, numpy), which were installed the same way as the PyOpenGL. I am confident that there is only 1 python running on my MacOS.
Assistant: Maybe you need to reconfigure your interpreter.
If you installed PyOpenGL as an egg after pydev was set up your PYTHONPATH might be out of date.
Check out Preferences->PyDev->Interpreter - Python
