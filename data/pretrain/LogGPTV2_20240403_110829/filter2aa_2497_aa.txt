MOTIVATIONS BEHIND THIS TALK 
No Such Thing as Drone Defense ‘Best Practices’ 
• Companies are beginning to implement 1st generation drone defense solutions / products

• There are no ‘best practices’ or proven methods for defense against drones 
• Practical pentesting tools are needed to test the effectiveness of these new ‘drone 
defense’ deployments

• Raspberry Pi based copters have the obvious appeal of being heavily developed and supported by 
both the drone and hacker communities.  
• The 2 most popular Raspberry Pi based flight controllers are the Erle-Brain 3 and the Navio 2:

Essentially starting with working / flying Erle-Copter and then 
adding hacking capability (without breaking flying ability): 
•
Adding Hardware – e.g. USB peripherals to Raspberry Pi, shelves 
•
Adding Software – e.g. drivers, config changes, installs, etc.

“The FAA believes that 2017 will be the big turning point in drone 
adoption by businesses, which use them for everything from scanning 
power lines to inspecting rooftops for insurance companies. 
Commercial sales are expected to reach 2.5 million, after which sales 
will increase only slightly for the next few years.” -- Forbes

“Drone sales are expected to grow from 2.5 million this year to 7 million 
in 2020, according to report released this week by the Federal Aviation 
Administration...  Hobbyist sales will more than double from 1.9 million 
drones in 2016 to 4.3 million in 2020, the agency said. Meanwhile, 
business sales will triple over the period from 600,000 to 2.7 million.”
