I am encountering difficulties while attempting to install NumPy on an Amazon EC2 server. I have tried multiple methods, including `easy_install`, `pip`, and `pip` within different virtual environments (one of which uses Python 2.7). However, each attempt has resulted in the same error: "gcc: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1)". Additionally, further down the line, I encounter a series of Python errors. When using `easy_install`, I receive the following error: "ImportError: No module named numpy.distutils". With `pip`, the error is: "UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 72: ordinal not in range(128)".

The EC2 instance is running kernel version 3.4.43-43.43.amzn1.x86_64. Has anyone successfully resolved this issue? While NumPy installations have been challenging for me in the past, I have generally managed to figure them out. At this point, I am not concerned about whether it is installed in its own virtual environment; I simply want to get it up and running.

**Update:**
I eventually managed to install NumPy by using `yum` with the command `sudo yum install numpy`. This seems to be the most viable solution for now. For future work involving virtual environments where NumPy is required, I will instruct the virtual environment to use site packages.

Thank you for the suggestion, @Robert.
