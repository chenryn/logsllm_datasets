User: I am having trouble installing numpy on an Amazon EC2 server. I have tried using easy_install, pip, pip inside a virtual env, pip inside another virtual env using python 2.7... 
Every time I try, it fails with the error: gcc: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1), and then further down the line I get a bunch of python errors, with easy_install I get: ImportError: No module named numpy.distutils, and with pip I get: UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 72: ordinal not in range(128). 
The EC2 instance is running kernel 3.4.43-43.43.amzn1.x86_64. Has anybody solved this problem? Numpy has always been hard for me to install, but I can usually figure it out... at this point I don't care whether it is in it's own virtualenv, I just want to get it installed.
Assistant: I ended up just installing numpy through yum, sudo yum install numpy. I guess this is the best I can do for now. When working with virtualenv and I need numpy, I will tell it to use site packages.
Thanks for the suggestion @Robert.
