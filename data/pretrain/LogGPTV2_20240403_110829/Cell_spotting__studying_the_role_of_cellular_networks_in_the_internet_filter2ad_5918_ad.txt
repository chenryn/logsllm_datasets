are labeled cellular. We notice the large gap between the distribution
of subnet and demand fractions that are cellular. The gap is larger
than 0.5 at median, indicating that even in networks where the
majority of demand is cellular, a sizable portion of subnets are low-
demand and non-cellular. We expand on this disparity between
cellular subnetcellular demand in the following section.
Composition of individual mixed networks. We now compare
subnet allocation and cellular demand between two large cellular
ASes, a dedicated and mixed one. We pick a large U.S. operator as
the dedicated cellular AS and a large mixed European operator as
the example of a mixed network. The US operator is one of the
largest cellular operators in terms of demand. Figure 6 plots, for
each cellular AS, a CDF of demand along with a CDF of subnet
allocation, across each subnets calculated cellular percentage (§ 4.3)
We see in Figure 6a that even within a dedicated cellular AS, 40%
of /24 subnets have a cellular ratio of 0, with virtually no demand.
Similar, nearly 50% of addresses with a cellular ratio greater than
0.95 (basically all cellular) also accounts for little to no demand.
Nearly all demand in this AS comes from a few /24 subnets which
range in cellular ratios between 0.7 and 0.9.
This pattern is in clear contrast with that of mixed operators,
which serves fixed-line and cellular customers out of the same AS.
Despite being one of the largest cellular providers in its country,
less than 2% of its /24 subnets have a cellular ratio greater than
0.2, and capture less than 6% of network demand. In fact, in this
operator only 24 /24 subnets account for 99.3% of cellular demand.

look at DNS resolver usage for cellular clients across these different
ASes.
6.1 Mixed Operators
We find that cellular access networks can exist in either dedicated or
mixed ASes. We define dedicated ASes as those offering only cellular
connectivity to customers, though this can include home broad-
band delivered over cellular connection. Mixed networks are those
offering both cellular and fixed-line services to customers, where
fixed-line services include residential broadband technologies like
DSL, cable or fiber-to-the-home (FTTH). Here we investigate the
degree of mixed networks for global cellular ASes.
Mixed networks arise as many Internet service providers offer
both class of services to customers. Through conversations with
operators of large mixed networks, we learned that management
simplicity and cost savings are some of the main motivations for
these networks, especially given the exponential growth in mobile
data traffic. While convenient for operators, mixed ASes complicate
the work of network services, such as CDNs, trying to optimize
performance, or diagnose performance problems of end-users.
We classify cellular networks based on the fraction of their net-
work demand that is cellular. We calculate the cellular demand (CD)
of an AS as the cumulative demand from all cellular subnets . The
cellular fraction of demand (CFD) is derived as the ratio of Cellular
Demand to the overall demand from all active subnets within that
AS.
Figure 5 plots the fraction of each AS’s demand that is cellular
(CFD). When looking at this distribution, we find no particularly
popular configurations of cellular operators, with demand fractions
forming a continuous spectrum rather than distinct classes.
To explore this further, we manually investigated the top 50
cellular ASes in terms of cellular demand (CD), labeling each as
either Dedicated or Mixed based on information from the providers’
website. In cases where mixed networks use multiple ASes, we still
label the AS as cellular if the fraction of demand is greater than
0.95. Using this criteria, we find 32 of the top 50 cellular ASes are
dedicated, with the remaining 18 residing in mixed ASes. Look-
ing at the dedicated ASes, we find that 19 of the 32 have demand

Figure 7: Cellular demand distribution across all identified
cellular operators. The top ten global cellular operators hold
a disproportionally large fraction of the total, accounting
for 38% of global cellular demand.
6.2 Traffic Demand
We now investigate the distribution of cellular traffic demand, first
across different operators, and second within individual operator
networks.
Traffic demand across operators. We first look at the distri-
bution of demand across our set of global cellular ASes. Figure 7
plots the cellular demand across cellular ASes, with ASes ranked by
demand. We represent demand as the normalized fraction of overall
global cellular demand originating from each AS. We observe a
disproportionally high share of demand contained within the top
10 ASes, and particularly among the top 5 ASes. In fact, these top
five ASes alone account for 35.9% of the global cellular demand.
In Table 7 we take a closer look at these top ten ASes, their coun-
try of origin and their cellular demand. Even within these top ten
operators, traffic is largely skewed towards the very top operators,
with the largest mobile AS containing 8.8x the demand from the
10th ranked operator. We first notice that the list is dominated by
the two largest cellular ASes with respect to demand, approximately
equivalent in their total demand, and each with 62.2% and 61.7%
greater demand than the third ranked operator.
Table 7: Top ten ASes by demand around the globe.
Additionally, we can see that these large ASes are located largely
in either the U.S. or Japan, which account for 7 out of the top 10
cellular ASes. The U.S. alone constitutes all top three cellular ASes,
as well as 4 out of the top 5 ASes. Last we see that while the all top 6
ASes are dedicated cellular, 3 out of the top 10 are mixed operators,
meaning they exist in networks composed of both cellular and
fixed-line access technologies.
Subnet Traffic Demand. Changing our focus to subnets, we
find that cellular traffic is dominated by a small number of /24
subnets. These heavy-hitter cellular subnets are much more con-
centrated in their demand than are seen in fixed subnets. Figure 8
illustrates this for a large mixed European ISP.
In the figure, the majority of cellular demand is distributed across
only 25 individual /24 subnets, which capture 99.3% of all cellular
demand. After those top 25 subnets, demand in the next largest
cellular subnet steeply drops by nearly two orders of magnitude.
In contrast, the fixed-line demand is more gradually distributed
across its addresses. The drop off in fixed-line subnet traffic occurs
after 3 orders of magnitude more addresses than for cellular. In
this particular network, cellular demand accounted for only 4.9%
of the total, and yet all of the 25 top cellular subnets originated
more demand than the largest fixed-line subnet. This can be at least
partially explained in light of the widespread use of carrier-grade

fixed subnets within a large European mixed network. Cel-
lular demand is concentrated within a small handful of /24

NATs within cellular networks [32, 39]. In the larger context, this
means that cellular addresses are some of the most concentrated
network subnets on the Internet with regards to demand and that,
in many instances, they can be represented by a relatively few
number of IP addresses.
6.3 DNS and Cellular Networks
Last we present the results of our analysis of DNS resolvers usage
in cellular networks. Our vantage point at a large CDN allows a
comprehensive look at the DNS traffic from networks worldwide.
In the following paragraphs we look first at the assignment of DNS
resolvers in mixed cellular networks and then analyze the use of
public DNS services across all cellular networks.
To analyze resolver usage across cellular clients, we first gen-
erated client-to-resolver affinities, produced by a similar method
to those used by Chen et al. [7]. The end result is a weighted as-
sociation between client subnet and resolver IP addresses. For our
analysis, we combine these client to resolver associations with the
previous two datasets, to calculate the amount of demand from
each subnet assigned to each resolver. After aggregating these data
sources by resolver, we are left with cellular and fixed-line demand
originating from each resolver.
Mixed Network Resolvers. We first calculate the fraction of
cellular demand across all DNS resolvers in the 392 previously de-
termined mixed cellular ASes. The sharing of resolvers between
mobile and fixed-line customers has clear implications for con-
tent providers and delivery networks, since DNS-based redirection
remains the dominant method for content request routing [33].
Figure 9 plots the CDF of this fraction of cellular traffic across all
resolvers in the mixed cellular networks identified in the previous
section. A fraction of 0 indicates a resolver that sees only fixed-line
requests while a fraction of 1 indicates a resolver that sees only
cellular traffic requests.
The figure clearly shows that a majority of resolvers - close to
60% - are shared between cellular and fixed-line customers, with
the median resolver serving approximately 25% cellular and 75%
fixed-line demand. The reminding resolvers appeared to be split

solvers. Nearly 60% of resolvers in mixed cellular networks
are shared between cellular and fixed-line customers.
evenly (≈ 20% on each side) between those dedicated to cellular
and non-cellular requests.
Sharing resolvers between cellular and fixed-line customers may
not indicate any issues, since both fixed-line and cellular clients
could reside in the same geographic areas, and peer at the same
locations. However, we discovered several operators where cellular
clients were assigned to distant shared resolvers, yet resolvers were
proximal to their fixed-line customers. For example, in a large
mixed cellular operator in Brazil, cellular clients in Fortaleza in
northern Brazil are assigned to DNS resolvers in Sao Paulo, 1470
miles away. On the other hand, the fixed-line customers assigned
to those resolvers were nearly all in Sao Paolo, and represented 80%
of that resolvers’ end-user demand.
Public DNS Usage. We next look at public DNS usage across
cellular networks. Public DNS services have grown increasingly
popular in recent years due to claims of greater reliability and their
potential for censorship avoidance. On the other hand, previous
work has also shown that their use may result in suboptimal redi-
rections to replicas located far away from clients [9, 29]. Despite
previous reports to the contrary [33], we find that outside of the
U.S. there is significant adoption of public DNS services in cellular
operators. To calculate the rate of public DNS usage in cellular
networks we use the same methodology as above and compute the
fraction of demand resolved through common public DNS services:
GoogleDNS [15], OpenDNS [25], and Level3 [20].
Figure 10 shows the fraction of requests coming through three
popular public DNS services. While U.S. operators adhere to con-
ventional wisdom on the use of public DNS in mobile operators,
with less than 2% of requests being sent through public resolvers,
we found a sizable number of global MNOs reliant on public DNS
infrastructure despite their potential impact on network perfor-
mance and QoE. Note that unlike in broadband networks, where
users may change their DNS configuration independently of their
operator, to use of public DSN service in cell networks implies op-
erator adoption. In one large operator in India, for instance, we see
public resolver being use in nearly 40% of cases. Both Honk Kong
operators use public resolvers for over 55% of requests, and in the
extreme example, we see 97% of request demand coming through
public DNS resolver for a mobile operator in Algeria. The latter is
most likely due to that operator utilizing a DNS forwarder towards
these public options.
