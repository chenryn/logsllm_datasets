or using the defender’s filter. We have already discussed robustness
of NoiseScope against such countermeasures.
Summary. We evaluated a range of challenging countermeasures
against NoiseScope. NoiseScope is resilient against compression at-
tacks, considered to be challenging in prior work. We also recom-
mend effective recovery schemes against different types of post-
processing attacks—Wavelet-noising, adding noise, and Gamma
correction. The countermeasures that evaded detection includes
those that degraded image quality significantly and can be con-
sidered as unsuccessful countermeasures. Online platforms like
news/social media sites collecting images, can reject images that

ACSAC 2020, December 7–11, 2020, Austin, USA
are excessively post-processed. There is ongoing work on detect-
ing image manipulations or post-processing. For example, Adobe
recently developed new tools to detect Photoshopped images [76].
NoiseScope can leverage such tools and implement appropriate re-
covery measures to make its detection pipeline more resilient to
different countermeasures.
7 CONCLUSION
Deep learning research has tremendously advanced capabilities of
generative models. GAN models can generate photorealistic images
or deepfakes that could be used for different malicious purposes,
e.g., to spread fake news, create fake accounts. In this work, we
present NoiseScope, a method to detect deepfakes in a blind manner,
i.e., without any a priori access to fake images or their generative
models. The key idea is to leverage unique patterns left behind by
generative models when a fake image is produced. Our method is
evaluated on 11 diverse deepfake datasets, covering 4 high quality
generative models, and achieves over 90% F1 score in detecting fake
images. We also analyze the resilience of NoiseScope against a range
of countermeasures.
