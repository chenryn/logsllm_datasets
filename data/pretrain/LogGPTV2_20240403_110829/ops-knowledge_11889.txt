Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and FSNamesystem components of a distributed file system exchanging data blocks. The DataNode components are receiving blocks from various sources, and the FSNamesystem is updating the blockMap with the source and size of the blocks. Additionally, the PacketResponder components are terminating.
