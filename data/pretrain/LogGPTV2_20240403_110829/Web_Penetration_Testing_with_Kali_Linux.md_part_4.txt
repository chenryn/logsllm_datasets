### Step 2: Target Evaluation

Once a target is identified and researched through the Reconnaissance phase, the next step is to evaluate the target for vulnerabilities. At this stage, the Penetration Tester should have sufficient information about the target to select appropriate methods for identifying potential weaknesses. This may include testing web application operations, identified services, communication ports, or other relevant areas.

**Vulnerability Assessments and Security Audits** typically conclude after this phase of target evaluation. Detailed information gathered during Reconnaissance enhances the accuracy of targeting possible vulnerabilities, reduces the time required for target evaluation, and helps in avoiding detection by existing security measures. For example, running a generic vulnerability scanner against a web application server might alert the asset owner, take a long time to execute, and only provide general details about the system and applications. In contrast, scanning a server for a specific vulnerability based on data from Reconnaissance would be less detectable, more likely to yield exploitable results, and faster to execute.

Target evaluation can be manual or automated using tools. Kali Linux offers a variety of tools categorized under **Vulnerability Analysis**, which range from assessing network devices to databases.

**Goals of Target Evaluation:**
- Evaluate targets for weaknesses.
- Identify and prioritize vulnerable systems.
- Map vulnerable systems to their respective asset owners.
- Document findings.

### Step 3: Exploitation

This step involves exploiting the identified vulnerabilities to verify their existence and determine what information or access can be obtained. Exploitation distinguishes Penetration Testing from passive services such as Vulnerability Assessments and Audits. Unauthorized exploitation has legal implications, so it must be conducted with proper authorization.

The success of this step depends heavily on the quality of previous efforts. Most exploits are designed for specific vulnerabilities and can have unintended consequences if executed incorrectly. Best practice is to identify a few key vulnerabilities and develop an attack strategy, starting with the most critical ones.

Exploitation can be manual or automated, depending on the objective. Examples include running SQL injections to gain admin access to a web application or social engineering a Helpdesk person to obtain admin login credentials. Kali Linux provides a dedicated set of **Exploitation Tools** for these purposes.

**Goals of Exploitation:**
- Exploit vulnerabilities.
- Obtain initial foothold.
- Capture unauthorized data.
- Aggressively social engineer.
- Attack other systems or applications.
- Document findings.

### Step 4: Privilege Escalation

Gaining access to a target does not necessarily mean achieving the goal of a penetration assignment. Exploiting a vulnerable system often grants limited access to the target's data and resources. The attacker must escalate privileges to gain the necessary access, such as sensitive data or critical infrastructure.

Privilege escalation can involve identifying and cracking passwords, user accounts, and unauthorized IT spaces. For example, achieving limited user access, finding a shadow file containing administrative login credentials, obtaining an administrator password through password cracking, and accessing internal application systems with elevated rights.

Kali Linux includes tools for **Password Attacks** and **Exploitation** that can help in privilege escalation. These tools are grouped according to their functionality.

**Goals of Privilege Escalation:**
- Obtain escalated access to systems and networks.
- Uncover other user account information.
- Access other systems with elevated privileges.
- Document findings.

### Step 5: Maintaining a Foothold

The final step is to maintain access by establishing additional entry points into the target and, if possible, covering evidence of the penetration. It is possible that penetration efforts will trigger defenses that will eventually secure the primary access path. Best practice is to establish alternative means of access as insurance. These could include backdoors, new administration accounts, encrypted tunnels, and new network access channels.

Another important aspect is removing evidence of the penetration to make it harder to detect and reduce the reaction by security defenses. This includes erasing user logs, masking existing access channels, and removing traces of tampering, such as error messages caused by penetration efforts.

Kali Linux includes a category of tools called **Maintaining Access** focused on keeping a foothold within a target.

**Goals of Maintaining a Foothold:**
- Establish multiple access methods to the target network.
- Remove evidence of authorized access.
- Repair systems impacted by exploitation.
- Inject false data if needed.
- Hide communication methods through encryption and other means.
- Document findings.

### Introducing Kali Linux

Kali Linux is an advanced Penetration Testing distribution developed by the creators of BackTrack. Released on March 13, 2013, Kali Linux is based on Debian and uses an FHS-compliant filesystem. It offers several advantages over BackTrack, including more updated tools, streamlined integration with Debian repositories, and enhanced customization features.

Kali Linux is available for download at [http://www.kali.org/](http://www.kali.org/).

#### Kali System Setup

Kali Linux can be downloaded in various ways, including ISO images (32-bit and 64-bit) and pre-built VM images for virtual machines like VMware. The VM image comes preloaded with VMware tools and supports PAE, allowing the system to access more memory than a traditional 32-bit operating system.

#### Running Kali Linux from External Media

Kali Linux can be run from external media like USB drives or DVDs without installing it on a host hard drive. However, this method has performance and operational limitations. It is highly recommended to install Kali Linux on a host hard drive for optimal performance and functionality.

#### Installing Kali Linux

Installing Kali Linux is straightforward and similar to installing other operating systems. Ensure you have compatible hardware and meet the minimum installation requirements. The installation process involves selecting language and keyboard preferences, setting a hostname, creating a password, and configuring partitions. Advanced users can choose manual configurations and LVM for partition management.

**Minimum Installation Requirements:**
- 8 GB of disk space.
- 512 MB of RAM (i386 and amd64 architectures).
- CD/DVD drive or USB boot support.
- Active Internet connection for repository configuration.

#### Kali Linux and VM Image First Run

Upon first boot, you may be prompted to set the root password. Enter the root username and the selected password to log in. If you downloaded a VM image, the default username is `root` and the password is `toor`.

#### Kali Toolset Overview

Kali Linux offers a wide range of tools categorized into groups such as Information Gathering, Vulnerability Analysis, Web Applications, Password Attacks, Wireless Attacks, Exploitation Tools, Sniffing and Spoofing, Maintaining Access, Reverse Engineering, Stress Testing, Hardware Hacking, Forensics, Reporting Tools, and System Services.

**Tool Categories:**
- **Information Gathering:** Tools for gathering data on target networks and devices.
- **Vulnerability Analysis:** Tools for evaluating systems for vulnerabilities.
- **Web Applications:** Tools for auditing and exploiting web server vulnerabilities.
