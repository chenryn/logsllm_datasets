User: Please describe what is load balancing? Give practical application scenarios and explain advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Load balancing is a method of allocating computing resources, which improves system scalability and reliability by distributing workloads to multiple computing resources. Load balancing can be accomplished in a variety of ways, including software and hardware. A common application scenario is web server load balancing. In this case, multiple servers can run concurrently, receiving requests from clients and processing them. It improves the performance and reliability of web applications by distributing the load across multiple servers. For example, when a server feels stressed, requests can be sent to other services for processing, thus avoiding application crashes or traffic paralysis. Advantages: 1. It can improve the performance and reliability of the system. 2. It can avoid system crash or failure due to overload. 3. Can achieve fault tolerance and high availability. Disadvantages: 1. Additional costs and management are required, including hardware and software. 2. Load balancing may become the bottleneck of the system. 3. Some specific applications, such as those that need to maintain a specific connection, may be affected.
