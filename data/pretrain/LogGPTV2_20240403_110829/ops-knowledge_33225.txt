Question: You are tasked with writing a user space program that needs to interact with a Trusty service using the Trusty IPC Client API. Which of the following steps, in order, would you take to establish communication, send a message, and close the connection appropriately?
"A": "Call 'tipc_connect()' with the service name, use 'write()' to send messages, and 'tipc_close()' to end the connection.",
"B": "Invoke 'tipc_create_channel()' with the device pointer, queue messages using 'tipc_chan_queue_msg()', and use 'tipc_chan_destroy()' to terminate.",
"C": "Use 'write()' to send a request to the Trusty service, call 'tipc_connect()' with the device node, and 'tipc_close()' to terminate the connection.",
"D": "Start by opening the device node with 'open()', then 'tipc_connect()' with the service name, and finally 'close()' the file descriptor."
Answer: A
