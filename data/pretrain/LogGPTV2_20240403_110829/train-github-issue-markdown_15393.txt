### Version
2.6.10
### Reproduction link
https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-template-bs7uj
### Steps to reproduce
Create a render function that uses dynamic imports (like `sliceZone.vue` in
the sandbox)  
then use it anywhere in your app (tested in a Nuxt project and a Vue
Codesandbox).  
You should notice an infinite loop that crashes your app.
### What is expected?
Dynamic import should work without the parent component to be re-rendered
### What is actually happening?
Component calling a dynamic import should not re-render indefinitely

The problem probably comes from my lack of understanding of Vuejs / dynamic
imports.  
Any working example would be greatly appreciated!
