**Title: BotConf 2014 - A New Look at Fast Flux Proxy Networks**

Botnets that operate on proxy service networks are not a new phenomenon. This topic has been discussed in various presentations over the years, including a significant focus at last year's BotConf 2013, where we examined the Kelihos network. Generally, a proxy network enhances connectivity and conceals the identity and location of malware Command and Control (C&C) servers from their nodes. These networks can be either fast flux or static.

In this talk, we will explore why fast flux remains the most efficient method for distributing malicious payloads. We will also present our recent findings from analyzing current fast flux proxy networks observed since January 2014. By definition, a fast-flux service network is created by setting up a selection of domains whose resolution "fluxes" through the IP addresses of a subset of available proxy nodes (bots). The operation of such a network involves multiple DNS aspects, multi-layer networking, and encrypted remote control methods, all of which enable the botnet herder to manage the network effectively.

For mitigation and detection, several methods can be employed, including sticky DNS records, Time-to-Live (TTL) monitoring, passive DNS, and domain reputation analysis. These techniques help in identifying and responding to emerging hostile fast flux activities. We will introduce these methods during the talk.

Fast flux adds an additional layer of evasion and protection for the actual sources of malware infections. Communication between infected hosts and the C&C servers always passes through the fast flux proxy network, making it difficult to trace the true C&C infrastructure.

To illustrate, we will discuss a research study conducted over several months on an active fast flux proxy network used to distribute the "zbot" malware. This network comprised tens of thousands of infected machines and hosted nearly a thousand C&C domains. It has been used to host C&C servers for various malware families, including Zeus variants, Asprox, and most recently, the new Zeus GameOver variant, which also delivered Cryptolocker payloads. We will provide detailed insights into the usage of this proxy network and discuss various cases of C&C domains.

The primary goal of this discussion is not to delve into the specifics of malware infection but to share the knowledge and techniques for detecting, monitoring, and mitigating the growth, management, and development of recent fast flux infrastructures. By sharing this expertise, we aim to enhance the capabilities of researchers in combating malware infections.
