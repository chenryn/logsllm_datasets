Once you have your Original VM created, configured, and updated, it is best to export a copy as a backup. You 
have put a lot of time into this, and I would hate to see you lose the hard work. If your computer or storage 
device would crash beyond repair, you would need to start over. If your Original VM would become corrupted, 
restoring the data would be quite difficult. I keep an exported copy of my Original VM on a USB drive in case 
of emergency. In VirtualBox, conduct the following steps.

You now have a fully functional cloned "Test VM". Any activity within that machine will not change anything 
in any other VMs. Repeat this cloning process any time you wish to conduct an investigation. In this scenario, 
assume 1 created a new clone titled Case #2021-143. I can open this new VM which appears identical to my 
original. I can conduct my investigation and close the machine. All evidence is stored within the machine and 
can be extracted to my shared folder or USB drive if desired. All of my VMs arc visible in Figure 5.04 (left). The 
Android VM visible at the top is explained in the next chapter. Figure 5.04 (right) displays the Snapshots menu 
option and an example of a Snapshot ready for restoration.

This plan ensures that every investigation is completed on a clean VM with absolutely no 
previous investigations. My exported investigation VMs can be provided to odier investigators 
discover}' in litigation. I am prepared to testify with confidence, if required.
I launch my OSINT Original VM weekly and apply all updates.
1 export my OSINT Original VM monthly as a backup.
I conduct all software auditing and install new apps for testing on the OSINT Test VM.
I create a new clone of the OSINT Original for every’ new investigation.
At the end of the investigation, 1 export all evidence to an external drive.
If necessary’, I create an exported copy’ of investigation VMs for later review.
1 delete investigation VMs when no longer needed.
This produces a single large file which contains your entire OSINT Original VM. You could import this file into 
any instance of VirtualBox with the "File" and then "Import Appliance" options. My strategy’ is as follows.
Windows VM

You will notice branding within the desktop advising it is a trial. If that bothers you, you must acquire a license 
and install from traditional media. This method is the easiest (and cheapest) option to possess a legal copy of 
Windows within a VM at no cost
• 
Navigate to https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/.
• 
Choose "MSEdge on WinlO" as the Virtual Machine.
• 
Choose "VirtualBox" as the Platform, and click "Download Zip”.
• 
Unzip the downloaded file and keep a copy with your other VM backups.
• 
In VirtualBox, click "File" and "Import Appliance" in the menu.
• 
Choose the "ovf1 file which you extracted from the zip file and click "Continue".
• 
Make any desired modifications as previously explained and click "Import".
• 
In the VirtualBox menu, click "Settings" then "Storage".
• 
Click the first"+" to add an optical drive, click "Leave empty", and click "OK".
• 
Before launching, create a snapshot of the VM as previously explained.
• 
Double-click the new Windows 10 machine to launch.
• 
Enter the password of "PasswOrd!" to enter Windows.
• 
In the VirtualBox menu, click "Devices" and "Insert Guest Additions CD".
• 
Through the Files explorer, double-click the mounted CD and choose "Yes".
• 
Click "Next", "Next", and "Install" to configure the default options.
• 
Reboot when prompted.
You now have a fully functioning and legal Windows 10 VM at your disposal. You can resize the window as 
desired and install any Windows applications. You can configure the copy and paste options, shared folder, or 
any other customizations as previously demonstrated. This is a 90-day trial, at which time the VM will no longer 
boot. You can revert to the original snapshot you created at any time to restart the 90-day trial. Surprisingly, this 
is allowed and encouraged from Microsoft.
While 1 prefer to conduct all investigations solely inside Linux, 1 respect that there may be a need for a Windows 
VM. In fact, I am using one now. I write all of my books within an offline copy of Microsoft Word. I create 
protected press-ready PDFs with Adobe Acrobat Pro. Neither of these applications run reliably on a Linux 
machine, and my personal laptop possesses Debian as the host operating system. Therefore, I keep a Windows 
VM for all writing. Installing Windows inside VirtualBox is not difficult, but licensing may be an issue. Therefore, 
we will rely on the official Microsoft Windows 10 VM available directly from their website.
I offer one final thought on creating your virtual machine. The chances of every application mentioned here 
installing without any issue is slim. Programs break, updates cause issues, and the countless variables on your 
system can be problematic. When something fails, keep moving on to the other options. Most of the time, a 
future update, which you will receive during your update process, will fix things which currendy do not work.
Hopefully, you now have a virtual machine in pristine condition ready for your investigations. Keep your original 
clean and only use it for updates. Make clones of it for each investigation. Make sure you have a safe backup 
copy stored outside your primary device. Most importandy, understand the steps you have taken. It is very likely 
that you will need to modify some of these commands as things change from the software developers. If you 
should receive an error on any specific step in these tutorials, search that exact error online and you should be 
presented many solutions. I send a sincere "Thank you" to David Westcott for opening my eyes to the many 
ways in which Linux can be customized for our needs as online investigators.

The first step is to install Brew. This is a package (software) manager which was mentioned in Chapter One 
when discussing antivirus options for Mac computers. If you installed Brew then, you do not need to repeat the 
process. If you did not, the following command within Terminal will install and configure the software. There 
is no harm executing this command a second time.

I was originally conflicted writing this chapter. I previously explained the benefits of Linux virtual machines for 
OSINT work and rely on them daily. I encourage everyone to consider them as a way to protect the integrity of 
online investigations while isolating each case. However, VMs are not for everyone. Since the seventh edition, I 
have heard from many readers asking to replicate the Linux tools within Mac and Windows. Some readers do 
not have hardware which supports virtualization. Some do not have the permission from their employers to 
install virtual machine software due to licensing concerns. Many simply are not comfortable with Linux and 
want an easier solution. You may just want the ability to practice within an operating system with which you are 
familiar. These are all legitimate reasons to avoid Linux and 1 hold no judgement. I must confess that I often 
download videos directly from my Mac with my own scripts. Regardless of your reasons, you may want to create 
an OSINT machine within native Mac or Windows. This chapter makes that happen. I believe the ability to 
replicate Linux programs within Mac and Windows will encourage non-technical readers to embrace these 
options. The tutorials within this section assume the following.
I begin with Mac because it is very similar to Ubuntu. In fact, Mac and Ubuntu are both based on a UNIX file 
system and most of the commands are cross-compatible. We will need to make many modifications to the 
operating system and scripts, but the basic usage will seem very familiar. I then explain the process for Windows, 
which involves many more steps. All of the software installed during this chapter is completely free for personal 
and commercial use without licensing restrictions. Ever}7 command within this chapter is available in digital form 
at the following locations. Similar to the previous tutorials, enter a username of "osint9" and password of 
"book!43wt" (without quotes), if required, for access to these resources.
All tutorials presented within this chapter assume you are working with a new Mac or Windows 
machine or VM. Pre-existing installations should function fine, but may conflict with some steps. The software 
and tutorials are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. In no event shall the author be liable for any 
claim, damages or other liability, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or tutorials presented 
here (this makes my lawyer happy).
This command may take a long time to complete. It may ask you for your password a couple of times, so you 
should monitor occasionally. In my test, 1 had to enter my password twice and confirm installation with "enter" 
once. Next, we need to install a recent version of Python3. While most Macs now have Python3 included by
• brew install python3

default, it is typically an older version. The following command within Terminal installs the latest version of 
Python3 and overrides the default version.
• cd -/Desktop
• curl —u osint9:bookl43wt -0
https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/tools.zip
• unzip tools.zip -d -/Desktop/
Next, configure the Firefox browser with all extensions and settings previously explained with the following 
steps.
• brew autoremove
• brew cleanup -s
• rm -rf "$(brew —cache)”
• brew doctor
• 
brew missing

• brew tap caffix/amass && brew install amass

Open Firefox and confirm all extensions and settings are present.
Next, we want to install several of the Linux applications mentioned within the previous chapters onto our 
native Mac machine using Brew. The first two commands can also take a long time to complete, but the third 
should run quickly. You may be asked for your password. The following commands configure the majority of 
our basic programs for immediate use.
Note that pre-existing Firefox installations may conflict with this tutorial. If needed, manually copy my profile 
to yours using the methods explained in Chapter Three. Now that we have Firefox configured, we need all of 
the custom scripts, links, icons, and tools which were present within the Linux VM. Conduct the following in 
Terminal. This will also remove any downloaded files which are no longer needed.
If any of these packages become unavailable, you will receive an error preventing all installations. If this happens, 
remove the missing package from these commands. After you have installed all of the Brew options, run the 
following commands to make sure everything is set up appropriately. If you receive any errors, follow the 
provided guidance within each dialogue.
