Once you have your Original VM created, configured, and updated, it is best to export a copy as a backup. You have invested a significant amount of time in this, and losing the work would be unfortunate. If your computer or storage device crashes beyond repair, you would need to start over. If your Original VM becomes corrupted, restoring the data would be quite difficult. I keep an exported copy of my Original VM on a USB drive for emergencies. In VirtualBox, follow these steps to export your VM:

1. **Shut down the VM** you want to export.
2. **Single-click on the VM** within the VirtualBox menu.
3. **Click on "File"** in the menu, then select "Export Appliance," confirm the selection, and click "Continue."
4. **Choose the "File" export location** on your drive and click "Continue" then "Export."

### Cloning and Using Test VMs

You now have a fully functional cloned "Test VM." Any activity within this machine will not affect other VMs. Repeat the cloning process whenever you need to conduct an investigation. For example, if you create a new clone titled "Case #2021-143," you can open this new VM, which appears identical to your original. You can conduct your investigation, close the machine, and store all evidence within the machine or extract it to a shared folder or USB drive if desired. All of your VMs are visible in Figure 5.04 (left). The Android VM at the top is explained in the next chapter. Figure 5.04 (right) displays the Snapshots menu option and an example of a Snapshot ready for restoration.

### Strategy for Managing VMs

- **Weekly Updates**: Launch the OSINT Original VM weekly and apply all updates.
- **Monthly Backups**: Export the OSINT Original VM monthly as a backup.
- **Software Auditing**: Conduct all software auditing and install new apps for testing on the OSINT Test VM.
- **Cloning for Investigations**: Create a new clone of the OSINT Original for each new investigation.
- **Evidence Export**: At the end of the investigation, export all evidence to an external drive.
- **Review Copies**: If necessary, create an exported copy of investigation VMs for later review.
- **Cleanup**: Delete investigation VMs when no longer needed.

This strategy ensures that every investigation is completed on a clean VM with no previous investigations. Your exported investigation VMs can be provided to other investigators for discovery in litigation. You will be prepared to testify with confidence if required.

### Windows VM Installation

To install a Windows VM, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to** https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/.
2. **Choose "MSEdge on Win10"** as the Virtual Machine.
3. **Choose "VirtualBox"** as the Platform, and click "Download Zip."
4. **Unzip the downloaded file** and keep a copy with your other VM backups.
5. **In VirtualBox, click "File"** and "Import Appliance" in the menu.
6. **Choose the "ovf" file** which you extracted from the zip file and click "Continue."
7. **Make any desired modifications** as previously explained and click "Import."
8. **In the VirtualBox menu, click "Settings"** then "Storage."
9. **Click the first "+" to add an optical drive**, click "Leave empty," and click "OK."
10. **Before launching, create a snapshot** of the VM as previously explained.
11. **Double-click the new Windows 10 machine** to launch.
12. **Enter the password of "PasswOrd!"** to enter Windows.
13. **In the VirtualBox menu, click "Devices"** and "Insert Guest Additions CD."
14. **Through the Files explorer, double-click the mounted CD** and choose "Yes."
15. **Click "Next," "Next," and "Install"** to configure the default options.
16. **Reboot when prompted.**

You now have a fully functioning and legal Windows 10 VM at your disposal. You can resize the window as desired and install any Windows applications. You can configure the copy and paste options, shared folder, or any other customizations as previously demonstrated. This is a 90-day trial, after which the VM will no longer boot. You can revert to the original snapshot you created at any time to restart the 90-day trial. Surprisingly, this is allowed and encouraged by Microsoft.

This guide ensures that you have a virtual machine in pristine condition ready for your investigations. Keep your original clean and only use it for updates. Make clones of it for each investigation. Ensure you have a safe backup copy stored outside your primary device. Most importantly, understand the steps you have taken. It is likely that you will need to modify some of these commands as things change from the software developers. If you receive an error on any specific step, search that exact error online, and you should find many solutions.
