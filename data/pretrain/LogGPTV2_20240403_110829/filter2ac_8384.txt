### Title: BotConf 2013 - The Power of Teamwork: Managing the Dissection of a Fast Flux Botnet, OP-Kelihos "Unleashed"

**Abstract:**

Tackling the resurgence of a Fast Flux botnet like Kelihos (previously known as Khelios), which was once declared to be shut down by major entities, is a formidable challenge that cannot be managed by a small team. A comprehensive understanding of the technical intricacies of the threat is essential for developing effective strategies to suppress its activities, gather evidence, conduct targeted intelligence, and coordinate with law enforcement agencies both regionally and internationally.

This presentation recounts the relentless and strategic efforts of the engineers at MalwareMustDie and their partners in combating this notorious botnet. To ensure the success of these strategies, a well-organized team with strong vertical and horizontal management and communication is crucial. The Information Security (InfoSec) community has the necessary resources to make this happen. At BotConf, we will share the know-how and motivation behind how dedicated individuals and engineers can collaborate to achieve significant results, demonstrating that managing a botnet can be done in a cost-effective manner.

The talk will conclude with a full disclosure of key achievements from the operation, and a hall of fame will be presented to recognize the contributions of all involved. We aim to cover all aspects within a 20-minute short talk, and print-outs of the shared basic details will be distributed before the session.
