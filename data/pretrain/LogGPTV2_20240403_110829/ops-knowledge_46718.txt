User: I need to trace the status for the tasks. i could get the 'state', 'info' attribute from the AsyncResult obj. however, it looks there's no way to get the 'done_date'. I use MySQL as result backend so i could find the date_done column in the taskmeta table, but how could i get the task done date directly from AysncResult obj? thanks
Assistant: You can get it from the _cache object of the AsyncResult after you have called res.result
for example
res._cache['date_done']
