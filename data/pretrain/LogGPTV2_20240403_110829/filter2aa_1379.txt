Introduction to
Authenticated Networks
 An authenticated wireless network is a 
network which requires a username and 
password to go online.
 They are increasingly common, although the 
same security flaws exist now that existed 
when the technology first became available.
NoCatAuth
 NoCatAuth is an open source wireless 
authentication system written in perl.
 Widely used
– Schools
– Coffee shops
– Restaurants
– Community Networks
Login Process
 DHCP
 HTTP requests are redirected to and SSL 
encrypted login page.
 Once authenticated, the firewall sets a rule 
that allows data from your IP and MAC 
address to pass through the gateway.
Bypassing Authentication
 Basically, all that you need to do to bypass 
the firewall rules is spoof the information of 
someone who is already authenticated.
 Three things need to be known
– MAC of target
– IP of target
– Location of the gateway
How the pickupline Works
 Creates a database
– Gateway information
– Target information
 Creates a thread in the background that sniffs for 
possible targets and attempts to identify the 
gateway.
 Once you have some targets, you can try spoofing 
them with the “spoof” command.
 If the spoofing is successful, you should be able to 
go on the internet as if you were authenticated.
How to Use the Tool
 start
– starts the background thread that gathers target information 
etc
 list
– lists all targets gathered
 spoof
– lets you select a target to spoof
 exit
– exits the program
