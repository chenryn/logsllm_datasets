## Introduction to Authenticated Networks

An authenticated wireless network is a network that requires a username and password for users to access the internet. These networks are increasingly common, although many of the same security vulnerabilities that existed when the technology was first introduced still persist today.

## NoCatAuth

NoCatAuth is an open-source wireless authentication system written in Perl. It is widely used in various settings, including:

- Schools
- Coffee shops
- Restaurants
- Community networks

### Login Process

1. **DHCP**: The client device obtains an IP address from the DHCP server.
2. **HTTP Redirection**: HTTP requests are redirected to an SSL-encrypted login page.
3. **Authentication**: Once the user successfully authenticates, the firewall sets a rule allowing data from the user's IP and MAC address to pass through the gateway.

## Bypassing Authentication

To bypass the firewall rules, one needs to spoof the information of a user who is already authenticated. This requires knowledge of three key pieces of information:

- The target's MAC address
- The target's IP address
- The location of the gateway

### How the Pickupline Tool Works

The Pickupline tool facilitates this process by:

1. **Creating a Database**: 
   - Stores gateway information
   - Stores target information
2. **Sniffing for Targets**: 
   - Runs a background thread to sniff for potential targets and attempts to identify the gateway.
3. **Spoofing**: 
   - Once targets are identified, the tool allows you to select a target to spoof using the "spoof" command.
   - If the spoofing is successful, you should be able to access the internet as if you were authenticated.

### How to Use the Tool

- **start**: Initiates the background thread that gathers target information.
- **list**: Displays all gathered targets.
- **spoof**: Allows you to select a target to spoof.
- **exit**: Exits the program.
