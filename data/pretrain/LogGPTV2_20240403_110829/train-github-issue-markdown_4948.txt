The current implementation of the Image Sizes listview is having usability
issues: the trash can icon gets cut off while the design is not following OS
design guidelines for lists. It allows for in-line editing, which makes sense
in a datagrid that holds a lot of information that you want to 'quick edit'.
The issues:
  * The ListView is too wide, the delete button gets cut off on smaller resolutions (and the default window width)
  * Users reported that they would like to have a better description of the stretch modes, there's no space to integrate that.
  * Inline editing is common for DataGrids, not for ListViews.
Current state:
