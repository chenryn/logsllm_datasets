### What happened
Upon upgrading to airflow 2.5.0, EMR Add Steps Operator now:
  1. Succeeds at adding a step to our emr job.
  2. tries to wait for the job to complete
  3. times out, retries, and duplicates the steps on our emr cluster.
  4. times out, and fails.
The cause seems to be an error in the operator:  
https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/27286/files#diff-94612f7f88a5f95ca9e3f23051f39f1e0b6a4cadac1f533615db5480b379ed34R115
Instead of passing `wait_for_completion=True` to the emr hook method
`add_job_flow_steps`, it should probably pass `self.wait_for_completion`.
Also, currently `self.wait_for_completion` seem to not be used anywhere in the
project.
### What you think should happen instead
The task should succeed once the EMR steps are added and move on to the next
task in the dag.
