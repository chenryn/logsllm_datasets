Political Conflict On and Off-Line
2
• There has been significant attention in popular media 
on the role of technology in political conflict across 
the globe over the last few years
• The Danish Cartoon Attacks
• Russia/Estonia Conflict
• Egypt
• Iran
• “Operation Payback” Anonymous attacks
Political Conflict On and Off Line
• Asymetric warfare and civilian attack is now a realistic and 
cost-effective attack vector
– Restructuring power relationships between the individual 
and the nation-state
• Technology is a useful mechanism for several reasons
– Near real time communication
– Potential level of damage can be significant
– Low cost
– Anonymity
– Minimal legal risk depending on activity

Preliminary Data and Model Statistical Model Building
• We are starting to get some preliminary data
– Respondents are undergrad and grad students at a large 
Midwest university
• Also beginning to build some preliminary statistical models
• We’re looking for other universities to collaborate with for 
cross-national comparisons

Different Social Dimensions Under Investigation 
as Related to Civilian Cyber Warrior Behavior
•
Civilian Cyber Warrior study is concentrating on..
•
Independent predictor variables including
– Level of skill
– Level of emotive national identity
– Level of nationalistic ethnocentrism
– Level of antagonism towards outgroups
– Level of belief in equality for groups
– Level of piracy of software and media
– Homeland – US or non-US declared as homeland
– Demographics
10
Independent Variables
• Emotive National identity
– I am proud to be a citizen of my home country. 
– In a sense I am emotionally attached to my home country and am 
emotionally affected by its actions. 
– Although at times I may not agree with the government, my 
commitment to my home country always remains strong.
– I feel a great pride in the land that is my home country.
– When I see my home country's flag flying I feel great. 
– The fact that I am a citizen of my home country is an important 
part of my identity.
11
Independent Variables
• Belief in Group Equality
– It would be good if groups could be equal.
– Group equality should be our ideal. 
– All groups should be given an equal chance in life.
– We should do what we can to equalize conditions for 
different groups.
– We would have fewer problems if we treated people more 
equally. 
– We should strive to make incomes as equal as possible. 
– No group should dominate in society.
12
Independent Variables
• Outgroup Antagonism
– Some groups of people are simply inferior to other 
groups.
– If certain groups stayed in their place, we would have 
fewer problems.
– It's probably a good thing that certain groups are at the 
top and other groups are at the bottom. 
– Inferior groups should stay in their place. 
– Sometimes other groups must be kept in their place.
13
Independent Variables
• Nationalistic Ethnocentricity
– Other countries should try to make their government as much 
like my home country's government as possible.
– Generally, the more influence my home country has on other 
nations, the better off they are. 
– Foreign nations have done some very fine things but my home 
country does things in the best way of all.
• Age
• Gender
14
Independent Variables
– What country do they consider their homeland?
•
United States
•
Non-United States
•
Pirating software or media
– Two separate questions “How many times in the last 12 
months have you knowingly downloaded, used, or made 
copies of… software … media”
•
Computer Skill – Advanced Skill Factor
– Using an operating system like Unix or Linux
– Using a standard computer programming or scripting 
language like C++, Perl, or Java 
– Installing an operating system like Unix or Linux
15
Predicting Cyber Attack Against Homeland
•
Using these independent variables in a multiple regression analysis, it appears that 
four factors predict cyber attacks against their homeland 
– Emotive national identity**
•
Negative relationship – less emotional identity equals more severe cyber attack 
magnitude
– Homeland support*
•
Non-US homeland individuals more severe cyber attack than  US homeland 
individuals
– Willingness to perform a physical attack***
•
Positive relationship – more severe physical attack means more severe cyber attack
– Pirate software or media***
•
Positive relationship – more piracy activity means more severe cyber attack
16
Predicting Physical Attack Against Homeland
•
Using these independent variables in a multiple regression analysis, it 
appears that five factors predict physical attacks against their 
homeland 
– Advanced cyber skills*
• Positive relationship - the higher the technical skills of the individual 
the more severe the physical attack
– Homeland support*
• US homeland individuals more severe physical attack than  non-US 
homeland individuals
– Willingness to perform a cyber attack***
• Positive relationship – the more severe the physical attack means the 
more severe cyber attack contemplated
– Pirate software or media***
• Positive relationship – more piracy activity means more severe cyber 
attack
17
Predicting Physical Attack Against Homeland
•
Using these independent variables in a multiple regression analysis, it 
appears that five factors predict physical attacks against their 
homeland 
– Outgroup antagonism*
• Negative relationship - the lower level of antagonism towards groups 
not like themselves, the more severe the physical attack
• That is, the more sympathetic to groups of people unlike themselves, 
the more severe the physical attack on their own homeland – “the 
activist effect”
18
Next Steps
• Work on building foreign country cyber and physical attack 
statistical models
• Continue to gather more data and refine analyses
• Encourage collaboration in collecting data from other 
universities both in the US and other countries
– Other country data useful for cross-national comparisons
