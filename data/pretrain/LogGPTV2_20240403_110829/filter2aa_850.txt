### Introduction

In recent years, the role of technology in political conflicts around the world has garnered significant attention in popular media. Notable examples include:
- The Danish Cartoon Controversy
- The Russia-Estonia Cyber Conflict
- Political unrest in Egypt
- Protests in Iran
- "Operation Payback" by Anonymous

### Asymmetric Warfare and Civilian Involvement

Asymmetric warfare, where civilians can become active participants, is now a realistic and cost-effective attack vector. This shift is restructuring power relationships between individuals and nation-states. Technology facilitates this through:
- Near real-time communication
- Significant potential for damage
- Low costs
- Anonymity
- Minimal legal risk, depending on the activity

### Preliminary Data and Statistical Model Building

We are in the process of collecting preliminary data from undergraduate and graduate students at a large Midwestern university. Additionally, we are developing initial statistical models. We are seeking collaboration with other universities for cross-national comparisons.

### Investigating Social Dimensions of Civilian Cyber Warrior Behavior

Our study focuses on several dependent variables related to civilian cyber warrior behavior:
- Willingness to commit acts of cyber terror against another country
- Willingness to commit acts of cyber terror against their own country
- Willingness to commit acts of physical terror against another country
- Willingness to commit acts of physical terror against their own country

### Physical Attack Scale Against Foreign Country

**Scenario:**
Imagine that the country of Bagaria has recently implemented national policies and taken actions that have negatively affected your home country, causing significant hardships for its people.

**Possible Actions:**
- Do nothing; let your country work it out on its own (151, 42.30%)
- Write a letter to the government of Bagaria protesting their actions (192, 53.78%)
- Participate in a protest at an anti-Bagaria rally (207, 57.98%)
- Travel to Bagaria and protest at their capital (90, 25.21%)
- Confront a senior Bagarian government official about their policies (68, 19.05%)
- Sneak into a military base to write slogans on buildings and vehicles (7, 1.96%)
- Physically damage an electrical power substation (8, 2.24%)
- Damage a government building with an explosive device (2, 0.56%)

### Cyber Attack Against Foreign Country

**Scenario:**
Aside from physical activities, what online actions do you think would be appropriate against Bagaria given their policies and actions?

**Possible Actions:**
- Do nothing; let your country work it out on its own (140, 39.22%)
- Post a comment on a social networking site criticizing the Bagarian government (272, 76.19%)
- Deface the personal website of an important Bagarian government official (41, 11.48%)
- Deface an important official Bagarian government website (39, 10.92%)
- Compromise the server of a Bagarian bank and withdraw money for victims (18, 5.04%)
- Search Bagarian government servers for secret papers to embarrass the government (35, 9.80%)
- Compromise Bagarian military servers to affect their readiness (24, 6.72%)
- Compromise a regional power grid, causing a temporary blackout (11, 3.08%)
- Compromise a nuclear power plant, resulting in a small release of radioactivity (1, 0.28%)

### Physical Attack Scale Against Homeland

**Scenario:**
Imagine that your home country has recently implemented national policies and taken actions that have negatively affected its own people, causing significant hardships.

**Possible Actions:**
- Do nothing; let your country work it out on its own (116, 32.49%)
- Write a letter to your home country's government protesting their actions (248, 69.47%)
- Participate in a protest against your home country at an anti-government rally (223, 62.46%)
- Protest at your home country's capital (194, 54.34%)
- Confront a senior government official about their policies (107, 29.97%)
- Sneak into a military base to write slogans on buildings and vehicles (10, 2.80%)
- Physically damage an electrical power substation (6, 1.68%)
- Damage a government building with an explosive device (3, 0.84%)

### Cyber Attack Against Homeland

**Scenario:**
Aside from physical activities, what online actions do you think would be appropriate against your home country given their policies and actions?

**Possible Actions:**
- Do nothing; let your country work it out on its own (131, 36.69%)
- Post a comment on a social networking site criticizing your home country's government (276, 77.31%)
- Deface the personal website of an important government official (47, 13.17%)
- Deface an important official government website (43, 12.04%)
- Compromise the server of a bank and withdraw money for victims (15, 4.20%)
- Search your home country's government servers for secret papers to embarrass the government (35, 9.80%)
- Compromise your home country's military servers to affect their readiness (16, 4.48%)
- Compromise a regional power grid, causing a temporary blackout (6, 1.68%)
- Compromise a nuclear power plant, resulting in a small release of radioactivity (3, 0.84%)

### Independent Variables

The study examines several independent predictor variables:
- **Level of skill**
- **Emotive national identity**
- **Nationalistic ethnocentrism**
- **Antagonism towards outgroups**
- **Belief in equality for groups**
- **Piracy of software and media**
- **Homeland (US or non-US)**
- **Demographics**

#### Emotive National Identity
- I am proud to be a citizen of my home country.
- I am emotionally attached to my home country and am emotionally affected by its actions.
- Although I may not always agree with the government, my commitment to my home country remains strong.
- I feel great pride in the land that is my home country.
- Seeing my home country's flag flying makes me feel great.
- My citizenship is an important part of my identity.

#### Belief in Group Equality
- It would be good if groups could be equal.
- Group equality should be our ideal.
- All groups should be given an equal chance in life.
- We should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups.
- We would have fewer problems if we treated people more equally.
- We should strive to make incomes as equal as possible.
- No group should dominate in society.

#### Outgroup Antagonism
- Some groups of people are simply inferior to others.
- If certain groups stayed in their place, we would have fewer problems.
- It's probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and others at the bottom.
- Inferior groups should stay in their place.
- Sometimes other groups must be kept in their place.

#### Nationalistic Ethnocentricity
- Other countries should try to make their government as much like my home country's as possible.
- Generally, the more influence my home country has on other nations, the better off they are.
- Foreign nations have done some very fine things, but my home country does things in the best way of all.

#### Demographics
- Age
- Gender
- Homeland (US or non-US)
- Piracy of software and media
- Advanced computer skills (e.g., using Unix/Linux, programming languages, installing operating systems)

### Predicting Cyber and Physical Attacks

#### Predicting Cyber Attack Against Homeland
Using multiple regression analysis, four factors predict cyber attacks against the homeland:
- **Emotive national identity**: Negative relationship – less emotional identity equals more severe cyber attack magnitude.
- **Homeland support**: Non-US homeland individuals are more likely to engage in severe cyber attacks than US homeland individuals.
- **Willingness to perform a physical attack**: Positive relationship – more severe physical attack means more severe cyber attack.
- **Piracy of software or media**: Positive relationship – more piracy activity means more severe cyber attack.

#### Predicting Physical Attack Against Homeland
Using multiple regression analysis, five factors predict physical attacks against the homeland:
- **Advanced cyber skills**: Positive relationship – higher technical skills lead to more severe physical attacks.
- **Homeland support**: US homeland individuals are more likely to engage in severe physical attacks than non-US homeland individuals.

### 预测针对祖国的网络攻击

通过多元回归分析，四个因素可以预测针对祖国的网络攻击：
- **情感国家认同**：负相关关系——情感认同越低，网络攻击的严重程度越高。
- **对祖国的支持**：非美国本土的个人比美国本土的个人更可能进行严重的网络攻击。
- **进行物理攻击的意愿**：正相关关系——物理攻击越严重，网络攻击也越严重。
- **软件或媒体盗版行为**：正相关关系——盗版活动越多，网络攻击越严重。

### 预测针对祖国的物理攻击

通过多元回归分析，五个因素可以预测针对祖国的物理攻击：
- **高级网络技能**：正相关关系——技术技能越高，物理攻击越严重。
- **对祖国的支持**：美国本土的个人比非美国本土的个人更可能进行严重的物理攻击。
- **进行网络攻击的意愿**：正相关关系——网络攻击越严重，物理攻击也越严重。
- **软件或媒体盗版行为**：正相关关系——盗版活动越多，物理攻击越严重。
- **对外群体的敌意**：负相关关系——对外群体的敌意越低，物理攻击越严重。也就是说，对外群体越同情，对本国的物理攻击越严重——“激进分子效应”。

### 后续步骤

- 构建针对外国的网络和物理攻击的统计模型。
- 继续收集更多数据并完善分析。
- 鼓励与其他大学（包括美国和其他国家）合作收集数据，以便进行跨国比较。
