User: Is there any way of writing pexpect like small program which can launch a process and pass the password to that process?
I don't want to install and use pexpect python library but want to know the logic behind it so that using linux system apis I can build something similar.
Assistant: You could just use "expect". It is very light weight and is made to do what youre describing.
