1.  Abstract
Recent years, and especially this past year, have seen a notable upswing in developments
toward anti-online privacy around the world, primarily in the form of draconian surveillance and
censorship laws (both legislated and suggested) and ISPs being pressured into individually acting
as both police and informants for various commercial interests. Once such first steps have been
taken, it is of course also of huge concern how these newly created possibilities could be used
outside of their originally stated bounds, and what the future of such developments may hold in
store for online privacy.
There are no signs of this trend being broken anytime soon. Combined with the ever growing
online migration of everything in general, and privacy sensitive activities in particular (like e.g.
voting, all nature of personal and interpersonal discussions, and various personal groupings), this
trend will in turn unavoidably lead to a huge demand for online anonymization tools and similar
means of maintaining privacy.
However, if not carefully designed, such anonymization tools will, ultimately, be easy targets for
additional draconian legislation and directed [il]legal pressure from big commercial and political
interests. Therefore, a well-conceived, robust and theoretically secure design for such an
anonymization protocol and infrastructure is needed, which is exactly what is set out to be done
with this project.
What is presented in this paper is the design of a protocol and complete system for anonymi-
zation, intended as a candidate for a free, open, community owned, de facto anonymization
standard, aimed at improving on existing solutions such as e.g. TOR − from the viewpoint of the
needs of today and tomorrow − and having the following important main properties and goals:
1.  Completely decentralized.
− No critical or weak points to attack or put [il]legal pressure on.
2.  Maximum resistance against all kinds of DoS attacks.
− Direct technical destructive attacks will be the only possible practical way to even attempt
to stop it.
3.  Theoretically secure anonymization.
− Probabilistic methods (contrary to deterministic methods) must be used in a completely
decentralized design like this, where no other peer can be trusted, so focus is put on
optimizing these methods.
4.  Theoretically secure end-to-end transport encryption.
− This is simple in itself, but still important in the context of anonymization.
5.  Completely (virtually) isolated from the "normal" Internet.
− No one should have to worry about crimes being perpetrated from their own IP address.
6.  Maximum protection against identification of protocol usage through traffic analysis.
− You never know what the next draconian law might be.
7.  Capable of handling larger data volumes, with acceptable throughput.
− Most existing anonymization solutions are practically unusable for (or even prohibit) larger
data volumes.
8.  Generic and well-abstracted design, compatible with all new and existing network enabled
software.
− Software application developer participation should not be needed, it should be easy to
apply the anonymization to both new and already existing products like e.g. web browsers
and file transfer software.
The Phantom protocol has been designed to meet all these requirements, and will be presented
in this paper.

2.  Introduction — Anonymity in the Context of This Paper
Anonymity can mean a lot of different things depending on the context in which it is used. In order
to avoid any misunderstandings in this paper, we will begin with a definition of anonymity in the
context at hand, which at the same time just might give some insight into other aspects and
motivations of this paper too.
Anonymity at its simplest core could be described as the inability for (all) other parties to discover,
in a given context, the identity of the party defined as being anonymous.
Well then you say, what is the definition of identity? In the context of this paper, and most other
contexts dealing with individual human beings, the identity of a person could be defined as the
set of information that directly, conclusively and uniquely describes and singles out that individual
among all other human beings in this world (and possibly other worlds too, depending on one’s
religious preferences). That is, more practically, the information needed to be able to show up on
a particular person’s doorstep, or at least file a (non-John Doe) lawsuit against them.
The subject of “John Doe lawsuits”, in turn (which is a law suit directed at a party whose real
identity has not yet been discovered) brings us to the subject of pseudonymity, which is related
to, and could perhaps be called “a lower form” of, anonymity. Under pseudonymity, a party can
operate without revealing its real identity, but various acts performed can still all be connected
and bound to this same entity, i.e. to its pseudonym identity. This pseudonym identity, in turn,
runs the risk of being connected to the real identity at some later point in time, and, if and when
that occurs, any act already connected to the pseudonym identity will be instantly attached to the
real identity, even though this real identity was not known at the time the acts were committed.
Going one step further in defining the concept of anonymity in the context of this paper, which in
turn deals primarily with anonymity in the context of Internet communications, we present here
below examples of some different practical and theoretical levels of anonymity that exist on the
Internet today:
• 
For those most blissfully ignorant Internet users, the Internet seemingly offers complete
anonymity. As far as these are concerned, you can just register a Hotmail address under
an imaginary name, an ICQ account with a naughty handle, an Internet dating site
account with a picture of David Hasselhoff, and then start enjoying your new and
alternative identity, without anyone ever being able to expose you or do the first thing to
prevent it.
— Complete anonymity. Diplomatic immunity of the Internet kind, woohoo!
• 
At the next level of enlightenment, the first problems of pseudonymity start to become
apparent to the previously so blissfully ignorant Internet user. It actually turns out that if
you start pumping out Viagra spam from your Hotmail or ICQ account, or start to sexually
harass just a few too many people over at that Internet dating site, your über anonymous
email, ICQ and Internet dating accounts will be reported to their individual service
providers, who will shut them down and maybe even send an angry letter to that other
ultra anonymous email address that you were just about to start using for your latest
body part enlargement product marketing campaign. Your pseudonyms have been
tracked down and taken to justice for your actions, and you now think you’re starting to
catch on to what that local EFF activist was going on and on about before you slammed
the door in his face.
— Replaceable pseudonymity. Ok, whatever, you can always register another email
account.
• 
At yet the next level of enlightenment, just when your latest massive Hotmail-borne Cialis
spam campaigns and your email trojan hobby project of finding naked pictures of people
on their home computers were starting to take off, it seems like some evil ultra haxor
have tracked down something called your “IP address”, and sent a bunch of abuse
reports to all those nice service providers that make your fledgling business enterprise so
enjoyable. Now all of a sudden you can’t seem to register any more batches of Hotmail

addresses with that cool Russian program, nor register any more Internet dating
accounts with pictures of David Hasselhoff. And to top it off, that nosy ISP of yours even
had the nerve to send a rude warning letter to your home, saying something about
unacceptable behavior, service agreements and other legal mumbo jumbo. Where the
hell do they get off saying something like that, not to mention how on earth could they
know anything about what you’ve been doing in the first place? What, do they have spies
looking in on people’s computer screens though their windows now? After pulling down
all the curtains, moving the radio-button in the cool Russian program from “Hotmail” to
“Gmail”, and finally managing to find another Internet dating site that apparently didn’t
find it affordable to pay the membership fee to the international black list of dating site
weirdos, pervs and just plain too ugly people, you really start to regret that you didn’t at
least give the EFF guy the opportunity to move his face out of the way before slamming
the door, realizing now that he might actually have been on to something there.
— Non-replaceable pseudonymity, the ISP seems to have some magical way of knowing
what you do, but luckily they aren’t allowed to reveal your real identity to anyone else,
right? (the ISP has logs of all your allotted IP addresses, which can be matched to abuse
reports)
• 
It is said that the Internet is a place of constant learning, and the field of anonymity is no
exception to that rule. What started out as a simple and righteous retaliation campaign
against the rude people behind those service providers trying to shut down your
legitimate businesses in the fields of Cialis retail and amateur porn, quickly turned into a
passionate hobby, and even yet another successful Internet enterprise. This after it
became apparent that the combination of email death threats and extortion by means of
private nude pictures is surprisingly lucrative. All of a sudden though, while minding your
