**Keith Donald** has opened **SPR-6306** and provided the following comments:

The setup process for Spring MVC could be significantly streamlined by introducing a custom XML namespace. A simple tag to configure `mvc:annotated-controllers` with sensible default settings would be an excellent starting point.

### Example Benefits:
- **After Implementing the MVC Namespace:**
  - Simplified configuration.
  - Reduced boilerplate code.
  - Easier maintenance and readability.

- **Before Implementing the MVC Namespace:**
  - More verbose configuration.
  - Increased potential for errors.
  - Higher complexity in managing controller configurations.

### Affects:
- Version: 3.0 RC1

### Issue Links:
- **#6422**: Add schema for web configuration (handler mappings) (marked as a **duplicate**)

### Additional Information:
- **Votes:** 1
- **Watchers:** 3

This enhancement would greatly improve the user experience for developers working with Spring MVC, making it more accessible and efficient.
