User: Use Python to write a script to perform data cleaning on a CSV file, including removing missing values, removing duplicate values, etc.
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script that can be used for data cleaning of CSV files: ``` import pandas as pd # read CSV files data = pd.read_csv('filename.csv') # remove missing values data.dropna(inplace =True) # Remove duplicate values data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True) # Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file data.to_csv('cleaned_filename.csv', index=False) ``` Note that this script The Pandas package is used to process CSV files, so it needs to be installed and imported for proper operation. In addition, other data cleaning operations can be added according to specific needs to improve the script.
