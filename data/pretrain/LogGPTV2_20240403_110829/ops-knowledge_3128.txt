User: How to monitor and analyze Linux system resources? Please provide common Linux commands and tools.
Assistant: Linux system resource monitoring and performance analysis is one of the skills administrators must master, especially in servers. Below are some commonly used Linux commands and tools that can help us with system resource monitoring and performance analysis. 1. top: Used to monitor the usage of system resources in real time, including CPU utilization, memory usage, process information, system load, etc. Operations such as sorting and filtering can be performed by key operations. 2. ps: Used to display process information and count system resource usage, including CPU utilization, memory usage, process ID, etc. Different options can be used to display different information. 3. htop: Similar to top, but provides more functions and interactive interface, supports mouse operation, and can perform process management, search, filter and other operations. 4. iostat: Used to monitor the I/O performance of the system, including disk read and write conditions, I/O transmission speed, request queue length, etc. Different devices can be monitored and different options can be selected to display different information. 5. sar: Used to monitor system performance and activities, including CPU, memory, disk, network and other aspects. Statistics and analysis can be performed on the historical data of the computer system. 6. vmstat: Used to monitor the virtual memory status of the system, including memory, disk, CPU, etc. It can display system status and throughput, and can also display the number of processes and the status of system processing. 7. netstat: It is used to monitor the local network connection status and service port status. You can check the usage of different ports, IP addresses, TCP/UDP connections, etc. 8. ifconfig: Used to manage and configure network interfaces, and display the network configuration of the system. You can view the status of the network interface, IP address, link status, MTU and other information. 9. tcpdump: It is a network packet capture tool that can be used to capture network packets and perform protocol analysis to understand the network activities of the system. 10. strace: Used to monitor system calls and signal processing, you can track process activities, find performance bottlenecks and problems. It can monitor system call, file system, network, IO and other information. The above commands and tools are commonly used in Linux system resource monitoring and performance analysis. We can use them to deeply understand the status of the computer system, find potential problems and optimize performance.
