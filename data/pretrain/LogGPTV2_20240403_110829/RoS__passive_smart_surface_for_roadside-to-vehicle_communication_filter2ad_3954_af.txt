### Separation from the Tag and RoS Decoding

Separation from the tag typically does not interfere with RoS (Radar-on-Tag) decoding, as these elements can be easily distinguished in the radar point cloud.

### Effectiveness of Elevation Beam Shaping

To verify the beam shaping design (Section 4.3), we fixed the radar 3 meters away from the tag and varied its vertical position to create height (and elevation angle) misalignments. For baseline tags without beam shaping, we stacked multiple VAAs (Van Atta Arrays) with zero phase offset (i.e., equal vertical distance) and ensured the stacks were positioned identically to those on our elevation beam shaping tag.

As shown in Figure 14a, the RSS (Received Signal Strength) of the baseline tags decreases as the elevation misalignment increases, while the RSS of the RoS tags remains more consistent. However, the decreasing trend is not monotonous, as the radar sometimes falls within the main beam of some coding stacks of the baseline tags, resulting in high RSS. This variability may be due to tag height mounting errors, tag swaying caused by wind, or bending of long coding columns, which are common in outdoor settings. Additionally, the baseline tags exhibit significant RSS variation. For example, the RSS varies by 13 dB when the tag and radar are at the same height. The primary reason is that the baseline tags have a narrow elevation beamwidth of 1.27°, making even minor misalignments impactful. Figure 14b shows the corresponding SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of the coding bits. With beam shaping, the SNR of the RoS tags remains above 15 dB (i.e., BER < 0.3%), thanks to their consistently low RSS variance. In contrast, the baseline tags achieve an SNR as low as 10 dB (i.e., BER 5.7%), significantly reducing detection robustness.

In summary, with elevation beam shaping, RoS tags function reliably even at ±4° of elevation angle deviation, corresponding to a tolerable height mismatch of 28 cm when the radar-to-tag distance is close to 2 meters. This tolerance increases with distance and wider elevation beams.

### Detection under Foggy Weather

Compared to vision sensors such as cameras and lidars, radar is robust under adverse weather conditions like fog, rain, and snow. For instance, at 79 GHz, the attenuation due to heavy fog (water droplet concentration of 1 mg/m³) is about 2 dB per 100 m [4], while that due to heavy rain (precipitation of 100 mm/h) is only slightly higher (3.2 dB per 100 m) [64]. Existing work has leveraged these properties to complement cameras and enable point cloud generation under adverse weather [43]. To demonstrate RoS performance under adverse weather, we used a fog generator [11] to emulate different levels of fog, as shown in Figure 12c. Figure 16c shows that the median SNR remains above 15 dB (i.e., a BER of 0.3%) across all fog levels, confirming the robustness of RoS against fog.

### Impact of Tracking Error

Modern vehicles are equipped with various location-tracking equipment (cameras, Lidar, IMU, etc.), but self-tracking errors are inevitable. To evaluate the impact of tracking errors on tag decoding, we added relative drifting errors ranging from 2% to 10% with a step of 0.2 m to the ground truth tracking data. Figure 16d shows that the SNR remains around 20 dB when the relative tracking error is less than 6%, and decreases with larger tracking errors, primarily due to distortions in the coding peaks in the RCS (Radar Cross Section) frequency spectrum. Fortunately, using IMU sensors and speedometers, existing works [60, 61] can track vehicles accurately with small drifting errors (e.g., ≤ 2%), meeting the tracking accuracy required by RoS.

### Impact of Angular Field of View (FoV)

The theoretical maximum angular FoV of a RoS tag is 180°, but this cannot be achieved in practice due to two limitations. First, the retroreflective beamwidth of a VAA is around 100°, and that of a typical radar antenna is only around 60° [22]. Second, as a vehicle radar moves along a straight line, the viewing angle is limited by the maximum detectable distance of the tag. To better understand the impact, we manually truncated the RCS to a limited FoV from 20° to 100°. Figure 17 shows the SNR of coding peaks with different angular FoVs. The impact of the angular FoV is minor. The decoding SNR slightly increases when the angular FoV increases from 20° to 80°. Theoretically, with a FoV larger than 60°, the location resolution is finer than \( \frac{2 \cdot \lambda}{\sin 30^\circ} = 0.5\lambda \), and the coding peaks can be clearly separated in the frequency spectrum of RCS. The decoding SNR slightly decreases when the angular FoV reaches 100°, mainly due to RCS measurements outside the radar's FoV, which are dominated by noise and raise the noise floor of the frequency spectrum. This result indicates that an angular FoV of 60° is sufficient to decode RoS tags. Given the maximum detection distance of 6 m using the TI radar, it only requires that vehicles move across a trajectory of at most 6 m when passing by the tag to sample the RCS across 60°.

### Impact of Vehicle Speed

We mounted the radar on a vehicle moving at speeds of 10 to 30 mph with a 5 mph step. Figure 18 shows the SNR measured at different driving speeds. The large variation across different speeds is mainly due to the more dynamic driving conditions compared to the case where the radar is mounted on a cart. Despite this, the decoding SNR consistently exceeds 14 dB (i.e., a BER of 0.6%), demonstrating the effectiveness of tag decoding in practical driving scenarios. While high speeds lead to prominent Doppler effects, the Doppler frequency shifts (e.g., 19 kHz at 80 mph) are orders of magnitude smaller than the carrier frequency of mmWave signals (i.e., 79 GHz) and have little impact on the RCS pattern, as validated by the consistent SNR in Figure 18.

### Discussion and Future Work

#### Extending the Detection Range

The TI radar used in our experiments is a development board with limited transmit power, antenna gain, and high receiver noise figure [22], which limits the detection range. Commercial automotive radars, however, have much better performance. With a low noise figure of \( NF = 9 \) dB [34] and EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power) of \( P_t + G_t = 50 \) dBm in the 76-81 GHz band [36], a maximum distance of 52 m can be achieved according to Section 5.3. The range can be further improved by overcoming the 6 dB RCS loss of the PSVAA (Passive Scattering Van Atta Array) with circularly polarized (CP) antenna elements [19]. Common objects change the left/right-hand direction of circularly polarized signals upon reflection, but the PSVAA with CP antennas does not, enabling the radar to separate reflections without the 6 dB loss.

#### Increasing the Encoding Capacity

The current RoS prototype has limited encoding capacity due to the near-far field tradeoff (Section 5.3), i.e., encoding more bits requires greater tag-to-radar separation, which reduces RCS. Using near-field-focusing-antennas (NFFA) [6] can relax this requirement, allowing a larger tag to encode more bits and be decoded by a radar within the near field. Larger encoding capacity also enables error correction mechanisms to improve decoding reliability. Additionally, with larger vertically stacked VAAs enabled by NFFAs, a higher RCS level can be achieved, ultimately raising the SNR of coding bits and reducing the coding BER. The encoding capacity can also be improved through modulation schemes other than OOK (On-Off Keying). The RCS levels of each encoding bit "1" can be adjusted by varying the number of PSVAAs within a stack, enabling ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying) modulation, which can improve the encoding capacity by several folds.

### Conclusion

We have designed and validated RoS, a lightweight mechanism to smarten road infrastructure through reconfigurable, radar-readable signage. The RoS design can be generalized as a smart passive surface, acting as a mechanically reconfigurable "barcode" for RF interrogating devices, including radar and RF communication devices such as WiFi, DSRC, and WiGig. The RoS design can be extended to accommodate a wider range of use cases. We confirm that this work does not raise any ethical issues.
