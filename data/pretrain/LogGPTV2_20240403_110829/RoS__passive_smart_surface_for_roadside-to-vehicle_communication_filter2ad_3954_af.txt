separation from the tag do not usually interfere with RoS decoding,
because they can be easily discriminated in the radar point cloud.
Effectiveness of elevation beam shaping. To verify the beam
shaping design (Sec. 4.3), we fix the radar 3 m away from the tag
and vary its vertical position to create height (and elevation an-
gle) misalignment. To create baseline tags without beam shaping,
we stack multiple VAAs with zero phase offset (i.e., equal vertical
distance) and ensure the stacks are positioned in the same way as
those on our elevation beam shaping tag.
As shown in Fig. 14a, the RSS of the baseline tags decreases as
the elevation misalignment increases while that of the RoS tags is
more consistent. However, the decreasing trend is not monotonous,
as the radar happens to fall in the main beam of some coding stacks
of the baseline tags and receives high RSS. It is possibly due to tag
height mounting errors, tag swaying caused by wind, or bending of
long coding columns, which are unavoidable in outdoor settings. In
addition, the baseline tags exhibit wild RSS variation. For example,
the RSS varies by 13 dB when the tag and the radar are placed at
the same height. The main reason is that the baseline tags only
have an elevation beamwidth of 1.27‚ó¶ so even minor inadvertent
misalignment can impact the RSS significantly. Fig. 14b shows the
corresponding SNR of the coding bits. With beam shaping, the SNR
of the RoS tags remains over 15 dB (i.e., BER above 0.3%), thanks
to their consistently small RSS variance. In contrast, the baseline
tags achieve an SNR as low as 10 dB (i.e., BER 5.7%), making the
detection much less robust.
In summary, with elevation beam shaping, the RoS tags work
reliably even at ¬±4‚ó¶ of elevation angle deviation. This corresponds
to a tolerable height mismatch of 28 cm even when the radar-to-tag
distance is close to 2 m. The tolerance increases with distance and
with a wider elevation beam.

a RoS tag fails when it is fully blocked by another vehicle, since
mmWave signals cannot penetrate metal. Chances of full blockage
can be reduced by mounting RoS tags higher than the vehicles and
installing redundant RoS tags along the road.
Detection under foggy weather. Compared to vision sensors
such as camera and lidar, radar is robust under adverse weather
conditions such as fog, rain and snow. For example, the attenuation
at 79 GHz due to heavy fog (water droplet concentration equals
1 mg/m3) is about 2 dB per 100 m [4] while that due to heave
rain (precipitation 100 mm/h) is only slightly higher (3.2 dB per 100
m) [64]. Existing work has leveraged such properties to complement
cameras and enable point cloud generation under adverse weather
[43]. To showcase RoS under adverse weather conditions, we use a
fog generator [11] to emulate fog at different levels, as shown in
Fig. 12c. In Fig. 16c, it is observed that the median SNR remains
above 15 dB (i.e., a BER of 0.3%) across all fog levels, demonstrating
the robustness of RoS against fog.
Impact of tracking error. Even though modern vehicles are
equiped with a variety of location-tracking equipment (camera,
Lidar, IMU, etc.), the self-tracking errors seem to be inevitable. To
evaluate its impact on tag decoding, we add relative drifting errors
from 2% to 10% with a step of 0.2 m to the ground truth tracking
data. Fig. 16d shows that the SNR remains around 20 dB when the
relative tracking error is less than 6%, and decreases with larger
tracking error, mainly due to the distortions of the coding peaks in
the RCS frequency spectrum. Fortunately, using IMU sensors and
speedometers, existing works [60, 61] can track vehicles accurately
with small drifting errors (e.g., ‚â§ 2%), which easily achieves the
tracking accuracy required by RoS.
Impact of angular field of view (FoV). While the theoretical
maximum angular FoV of a RoS tag is 180‚ó¶, it cannot be achieved in
practice due to two limitations. First, the retroreflective beamwidth
of a VAA is around 100‚ó¶ as shown in Fig. 4a, and that of a typical
radar antenna is only around 60‚ó¶ [22]. Second, as a vehicle radar
moves along a straight line, the viewing angle is limited by the
maximum detectable distance of the tag. To better understand the
impact, we manually truncate the RCS to a limited FoV from 20‚ó¶ to
100‚ó¶. Fig. 17 shows the SNR of coding peaks with different angular
FoV. The impact of the angular FoV is minor. The decoding SNR
slightly increases when the angular FoV increases from 20‚ó¶ to 80‚ó¶.
Theoretically, with a FoV larger than 60‚ó¶, the location resolution
is finer than
2¬∑2 sin 30ùëú = 0.5ùúÜ, and the coding peaks can be clearly
separated in the frequency spectrum of RCS. The decoding SNR
slightly decreases when the angular FoV reaches 100‚ó¶. It is mainly
due to the RCS measurements outside of the FoV of the radar, which
are dominant by noises and raises the noise floor of the frequency
spectrum of the RCS. The result indicates that an angular FoV of
60‚ó¶ is sufficient to decode RoS tags. As the maximum detection
distance of a tag is 6 m using the TI radar, it only requires that the
vehicles move across a trajectory of at most 6 m when passing by
the tag, so as to sample the RCS across 60‚ó¶.
ùúÜ
Impact of vehicle speed. We mount the radar on a vehicle
moving at 10 to 30 mph with a 5 mph step. Fig. 18 shows the SNR
measured at different driving speeds. The large variation across dif-
ferent speeds is mainly due to the more dynamic driving condition
compared with the case where the radar is mounted on the cart.
Despite this, the decoding SNR consistently exceeds 14 dB (i.e., a
BER of 0.6%), demonstrating the effectiveness of the tag decoding
in practical driving scenarios. While high speeds lead to prominent
Doppler effect, the Doppler frequency shifts (e.g., 19 kHz at a speed
of 80 mph) are orders of magnitude smaller than the carrier fre-
quency of mmWave signals (i.e., 79 GHz), and have little impact on
the RCS pattern, as validated by the consistent SNR in Fig. 18.
8 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
Extending the detection range. The TI radar in our experi-
ments is intended as a development board with limited transmit
power, antenna gain and high receiver noise figure [22], which
largely limits the detection range. Fortunately, commercial auto-
motive radars have much better performance. With a low noise
figure of ùëÅùëÅ ùêπ = 9 dB [34], and EIRP of ùëÉùë° + ùê∫ùë° = 50 dBm in the
76-81 GHz band [36], a maximum distance of 52 m can be achieved
according to Sec. 5.3. The range can be further improved by over-
coming the 6 dB RCS loss of the PSVAA with circularly polarized
(CP) antenna elements [19]. While common objects change the
left/right-hand direction of circular polarized signals upon reflec-
tion, the PSVAA with CP antennas does not, enabling the radar to
separate the reflections without the 6 dB loss.
Increasing the encoding capacity. The current RoS prototype
has limited encoding capacity due to the near-far field tradeoff
(Sec. 5.3), i.e., encoding more bits requires further tag-to-radar sep-
aration which in turn reduces RCS. By using near-field-focusing-
antennas (NFFA) [6], the requirement can be relaxed. That is, a
larger tag encoding more bits can be decoded by a radar within the
near field. Larger encoding capacity also allows for error correction
mechanisms to improve the reliability of decoding. In addition, with
larger vertically stacked VAAs enabled by NFFAs, a higher RCS
level can be achieved, which ultimately raises the SNR of coding
bits and reduces the coding BER. The encoding capacity can also
be improved through modulation schemes other than OOK. The
RCS levels of each encoding bit ‚Äú1≈æ can be adjusted by varying
the number of PSVAAs within a stack. Multiple RCS levels can
enable ASK modulation which can improve the encoding capacity
by multi-folds.
9 CONCLUSION
We have designed and validated RoS, a lightweight mechanism to
smarten road infrastructure through reconfigurable, radar-readable
signage. The RoS design can be generalized as a smart passive
surface which acts as a mechanically reconfigurable ‚Äúbarcode≈æ for
RF interrogating devices, including not only radar, but also RF
communication devices such as WiFi, DSRC, and WiGig. The RoS
design can be extended to accommodate a wider range of use cases.
We confirm this work does not raise any ethical issues.
