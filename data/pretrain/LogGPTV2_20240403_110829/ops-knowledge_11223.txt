Question: A company has experienced a security breach and multiple machines are compromised. You are tasked with determining the nature of the malware based on the behavior observed. The malware propagated without any user action and altered already-running code on the machines. Which type(s) of malware might be responsible for the infection, and what could be a potential application of this malware by the attacker?
"A": "A virus, because it requires user action to propagate and could be used to create a botnet.",
"B": "A worm, because it does not require user action to propagate and could be used to create a botnet.",
"C": "A virus, because it infects computers by altering already-running code and could be used to steal sensitive information.",
"D": "A worm, because it requires some user action to propagate and could be used to steal sensitive information."
Answer: B
