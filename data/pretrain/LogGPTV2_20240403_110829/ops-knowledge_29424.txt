### Issue: `ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application`

**Problem Description:**
I am encountering the following error when trying to import `cv2` in Python:

```
ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application
```

**System Configuration:**
- Laptop: 64-bit
- Python: 64-bit (Python 3.5)
- OpenCV: Installed via `pip install opencv-python-3.0.0+contrib-cp35-none-win_amd64`

**Steps Taken:**
1. Placed `cv2.pyd` file in the `site-packages` folder of Python.
2. Set `PYTHONPATH` to:
   ```
   C:\Python35;C:\Python35\DLLs;C:\Python35\Lib;C:\Python35\libs;C:\Users\CV\OpenCV\opencv\build\python\2.7\x64;%OPENCV_DIR%\bin;
   ```
3. Set `OPENCV_DIR` to:
   ```
   C:\Users\CV\OpenCV\opencv\build\x64\vc12
   ```
4. Added the following paths to the `PATH` environment variable:
   ```
   %PYTHONPATH%;%PYTHONPATH%\Scripts\;%OPENCV_DIR%;
   ```

**Attempts to Resolve:**
- Installed `opencv_python-3.0.0+contrib-cp35-none-win_amd64` using `pip`.
- Copied `python3.dll` from the Python installation folder to the virtual environment's `lib` folder.

None of these steps have resolved the issue. Can anyone provide guidance on how to fix this?

**Solution:**

In this case, the issue was resolved by copying the `python3.dll` file from the Python installation directory to the `lib` folder of the virtual environment. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Locate the `python3.dll` File:**
   - The `python3.dll` file is typically located in the `DLLs` subdirectory of your Python installation. For example, if Python 3.5 is installed in `C:\Python35`, the `python3.dll` file will be in `C:\Python35\DLLs`.

2. **Copy the `python3.dll` File:**
   - Copy the `python3.dll` file from `C:\Python35\DLLs` to the `lib` folder of your virtual environment. For example, if your virtual environment is located at `C:\path\to\venv`, copy the `python3.dll` file to `C:\path\to\venv\Lib\site-packages`.

3. **Verify the Solution:**
   - After copying the `python3.dll` file, try importing `cv2` again in your Python script or interactive session:
     ```python
     import cv2
     print(cv2.__version__)
     ```

If the import is successful and you see the version number printed, the issue has been resolved. If the problem persists, ensure that all environment variables and paths are correctly set and that there are no conflicting versions of OpenCV or Python installed.
