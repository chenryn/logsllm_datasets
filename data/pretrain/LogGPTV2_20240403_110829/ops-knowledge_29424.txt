User: ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application

Does anyone know how to fix this? This problem occurs when i am trying to import cv2. My laptop is 64bit and installed 64bit python, i also put the cv2.pyd file in the site-packages folder of Python.
My PYTHONPATH value = C:\Python35;C:\Python35\DLLs;C:\Python35\Lib;C:\Python35\libs;C:\Users\CV\OpenCV\opencv\build\python\2.7\x64;%OPENCV_DIR%\bin;
My OPENCV_DIR value = C:\Users\CV\OpenCV\opencv\build\x64\vc12
I also put reference of my pythonpath and my opencv_dir to the PATH by putting **%PYTHONPATH%;%PYTHONPATH%\Scripts\;%OPENCV_DIR%;**
I also installed opencv_python-3.0.0+contrib-cp35-none-win_amd64 through pip install and command line.
None of this solved my problem.
Assistant: in this case, I just copy file 'python3.dll' from my python3 installation folder to my virtualenv lib folder, and then it works.
