When creating variable inside tasks(using set_fact), even using "|int" filter,
result passed to jinja is still string.  
I've created full Proof Of Concept bug in github repo :
https://github.com/rafaltrojniak/ansible-jinja-casting
##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.4.5
##### Environment:
Debian 6.0.8
##### Summary:
When creating variable inside tasks(using set_fact), even using "|int" filter,
result passed to jinja is still string.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
I've created full Proof Of Concept bug in github repo :
https://github.com/rafaltrojniak/ansible-jinja-casting. To reproduce :
  * Clone the repo and "cd" into it
  * Set ssh access to localhost, so ansible could run
  * Run ansible-playbook site.yml -i hosts
##### Expected Results:
I expect all templates to be generated sucessfully.  
All multiplication results in templates should equal 10  
All additions results in templates should equal 11
##### Actual Results:
  * Variables in jinja seams to be string objects
  * Multiplication of strings result in repetitions of string, not mathematical multiplication
  * Addition to string result in fatal error
