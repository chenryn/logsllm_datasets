and the second one holds since λ ≥ 1.
On the other hand, if д(i, x ) (cid:44) д(i, y), then λ(i, x ) = λ(i, y) = 1.
This holds because x and y are neighbors, i.e. dGS (x, y) = 1, and
hence, ∆GS (i, x ) = ∆GS (i, y) = 1 and λ is such that ∆GS (j, z) ≥
λ(j, z) ≥ 1 for every j ∈ X and z ∈ D. Thus, in this case, the privacy
constraints trivially hold. This concludes the formal argument. □

A.5 Proof of Lemma 4.3
Proof. Let G be the neighborhood graph over D, d be the dis-
tance metric over X ×X, dG be the shortest path length metric over
G, and д be the anomaly identification function for (β, r )-anomaly
for arbitrarily fixed values of β ≥ 1 and r ≥ 0.
Firstly, we prove that the ∆G given by (2) is indeed the mdd-
function (β, r )-AIQ. Arbitrarily fix i ∈ X and any database x ∈ D.
We know that the value of д(i, x ) only depends upon xi and Bx (i, r )—
recall that д(i, x ) = 1 ⇐⇒ xi ≥ 1 and Bx (i, r ) ≤ β. Further,
dG (x, y) = ||x −y||1 since every two databases that differ by exactly
one record are directly connected by an edge. Hence, it follows that
for Ci = {j ∈ X : d (i, j) ≤ r},
∆G (i, x ) =
||x − y||1 =

We will consider four cases based on the condition (given in the
∆G) that x satisfies. From (5), we know that ∆G (i, x ) is the same as
the minimum number of records by which a database y differs such
that д(i, x ) (cid:44) д(i, y). Thus in the proof we will modify the database
x by adding or (and) removing records from x, and show that mini-
mum number of changes required in x to change the output of д is
given by ∆G.
Case 1: When x satisfies the first condition, д(i, x ) = 0. For any
database y such that д(i, y) = 1, it must hold that yi ≥ 1 and
By (i, r ) ≤ β. So we obtain a y by adding one record of value i to x.
Thus ∆G (i, x ) = 1.
Session 3E: Privacy IICCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom732Case 2: When x satisfies the second condition, here again sim-
ilar to the case above, д(i, x ) = 0, and for any database y such that
д(i, y) = 1, it must hold that yi ≥ 1 and By (i, r ) ≤ β. So we will
have to add one record of value i to x to obtain a database y′, but
now By′ (i, r ) ≥ β + 1. Thus, to obtain a y, we will have to remove
By′ (i, r ) − β = Bx (i, r ) + 1 − β records of values in Ci \ {i} from y′
(or x). Thus, ∆G (i, x ) = 1 + Bx (i, r ) + 1 − β.
Case 3: Here we assume that x satisfies the third condition; hence
д(i, x ) = 1. For a y such that д(i, y) = 0, either yi = 0 or By (i, r ) ≥
β + 1. Thus ∆G (i, x ) will be the minimum of xi (which corresponds
to the number of records of value i present in x that we will have
to remove) and β + 1 − Bx (i, r ) (which corresponds to the number
of records of values in Ci that we will have to add to x).
Case 4: In this case, д(i, x ) = 0 because Bx (i, r ) > β. Thus, we will
have to remove Bx (i, r ) − β records of values in Ci from x such
that there is at least on record of value i in the modified x. Hence,
∆G (i, x ) = Bx (i, r ) − β.
Further, in all the cases, ∆G (i, x ) ≥ 1. Therefore, we conclude
the ∆G is the mdd-function for д (i.e. (β, r )-AIQ).
Next, we prove that the ∆G is 1-Lipschitz continuous. Arbitrary fix
i and any two neighboring databases, x and y in G. Let the (k, l ) rep-
resent that x and y respectively satisfy the kth and lth conditions in
the ∆G, where k, l ∈ [4] such that k ≤ l. We will prove that for each
(k, l ), the ∆G satisfies the 1-Lipschitz continuity condition. Here,
note that if the ∆G satisfies the 1-Lipschitz continuity condition
under (k, l ) then it also satisfies the condition under (l, k ) because
|∆G (i, x ) − ∆G (i, y)| = |∆G (i, y) − ∆G (i, x )|.
For (1, 1), |∆G (i, x ) − ∆G (i, y)| = 0, and for (2, 2) and (4, 4),
|∆G (i, x ) − ∆G (i, y)| ≤ 1 since |Bx (i, r ) − By (i, r )| ≤ 1. Below, we
consider rest of the cases.
(3, 3): The case, when Bx (i, r ) = By (i, r ), is trivial. So, let Bx (i, r ) =
1 + By (i, r )—this is without loss of generality since ||x −
y||1 = 1 and |∆G (i, x )−∆G (i, y)| = |∆G (i, y)−∆G (i, x )|. Thus,
∆G (i, x ) = min(xi , β−By (i, r )) and ∆G (i, y) = min(yi , β +1−
By (i, r )). All the subcases, except for the following, trivially
follow from ||x − y||1 = 1.
(a) ∆G (i, x ) = xi and ∆G (i, y) = β + 1 − By (i, r )
(b) ∆G (i, x ) = β − By (i, r ) and ∆G (i, y) = yi
(a) is not possible as it requires xi  β.
(2, 3): This case too is not possible since it requires Bx (i, r ) ≥
By (i, r ) and xi  P (U∆G (y) = дi (y)) (i.e. U∆G
is not pareto op-
timal); fix this y. Note that дi (·) = д(i,·). We will prove that M
cannot be ε-DP.
Let z be such that dG (y, z) = ∆G (i, y) and дi (z) (cid:44) дi (y). Let w be
a neighbor of z such that dG (y, w ) = ∆G (i, y) − 1 and b = дi (w ) =
дi (y). Now, assume that M ε-DP. It follows that
P (M (w ) (cid:44) b) ≤eεdG(y,w ) P (M (y) (cid:44) b)
j∈X
Proof. Let G be the neighborhood graph over D. Arbitrarily fix
G, dG, and X as specified above (in the lemma). Since G contains all
the nodes and a subset of edges of G, dG (x, y) ≥ dG (x, y), where dG
is the shortest path length metric over G. Furthermore, it is a simple
observation that dG is the same as ℓ1-metric over the databases
(which follows from a simple induction argument). Hence, it follows
that dG (x, y) ≥ ||x −y||1. The second inequality holds since X ⊆ X
j∈X |xj − yj|. The Third inequality follows from
the reverse triangle inequality. This completes the proof.

But if yi = 1, λk (i, y) = ∆G (i, y) = min(yi , k ) = 1 as k ≥ 1. Hence,
the continuity condition is satisfied for this subcase, when xi = 0.
Next, let xi ≥ 1; thus under this subcase it follows that
λk (i, x ) =1 + k + min(0, xi − k ) = 1 + min(xi , k )
