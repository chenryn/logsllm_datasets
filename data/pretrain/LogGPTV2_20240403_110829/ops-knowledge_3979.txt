User: How to achieve data synchronization between local server and cloud server? For example via rsync or scp commands.
Assistant: To achieve data synchronization between the local server and the cloud server, you can use the following steps: 1. Make sure that an SSH connection has been established between the local server and the cloud server. If not, use ssh command to connect, for example: ``` ssh user@your-server-ip-address ``` 2. Use rsync or scp command to copy files from local server to cloud server or from cloud server to local server. For example, to synchronize files on the local server to the cloud server, you can use the rsync command: ``` rsync -avz /local/path user@your-server-ip-address:/remote/path ``` Among them, "/ "local/path" is the source path on the local server, "user" is the username on the cloud server, "your-server-ip-address" is the IP address of the cloud server, and "/remote/path" is the target on the cloud server path. 3. If you want to achieve real-time synchronization, you can use the --delete and --inplace options of rsync, for example: ``` rsync -avz --inplace --delete /local/path user@your-server-ip-address: /remote/path ``` Among them, the --delete option will delete local files that do not exist on the cloud server, and the --inplace option will perform in-place changes during file synchronization to reduce bandwidth consumption. In addition, you can also use the scp command to copy files, for example: ``` scp /local/path user@your-server-ip-address:/remote/path ``` Among them, "/local/path" and "/remote /path" are the file paths on the local and cloud servers respectively. It should be noted that the rsync and scp commands need to enter a password or use a key file for verification when copying files. If you wish to automate the sync process, you can use an ssh key pair for authentication so you don't need to enter your passphrase every sync.
