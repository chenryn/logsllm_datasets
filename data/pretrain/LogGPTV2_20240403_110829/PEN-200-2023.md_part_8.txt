### Infrastructure for Testing and Supply Chain Security

To facilitate testing, we can leverage our cloud provider to easily spin up complete replicas of environments. This approach allows us to create a test environment with relative ease, run the necessary tests, and then delete it, rather than continuously running a full patch test environment. The primary risk associated with this method is the potential for supply chain compromise.

**Continuous Supply Chain Validation:**
Continuous supply chain validation involves ensuring that the software and hardware received from vendors are as expected and have not been tampered with. It also ensures that the output software and materials are verifiable by customers and business partners. This process is challenging and may require more than just software checks, such as physical inspections of equipment. On the software side, deeper testing and inspection techniques can be used to evaluate upstream data more closely. Increasing the duration of security testing can help detect sleeper malware, which remains inactive on a system for a period (potentially weeks) before taking action.

**Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):**
Using an SBOM to automatically track dependencies in the application build process helps in evaluating supply chain tampering. By identifying software dependencies, creating an SBOM, and packaging the container and SBOM together in a cryptographically-verifiable way, we can verify the container’s SBOM signature before loading it into production. This process adds an additional layer of security, making it more difficult for adversaries to compromise the system.

### Encryption

Beyond tracking software, many organizations should leverage encryption to protect against adversaries. While encryption does not solve all problems, well-integrated encryption at multiple layers creates a stronger security posture. However, there are some caveats to consider:

- **Decryption and Data Restoration:** Encrypting all data is only useful if it can be decrypted and restored when needed.
- **Ephemeral Encryption:** Some data, like TLS, is meant to be ephemeral. In TLS, decryption keys exist only in memory for a brief time and are never stored on disk or sent across the network. This type of encryption is commonly used for sending secrets or Personal Identifiable Information (PII) across the wire.
- **Access Control:** Ensure that only the minimum required persons or systems can decrypt the data. Use different keys for backups to avoid reusing encryption keys for different purposes.

**Backup and Restoration Protocols:**
Implement protocols for routinely restoring from backups to ensure that the process works for every component. While detailed log data may not always need to be backed up, most compliance and auditing standards require historic logs. Some specifications may even require systems to query and delete specific historic log records.

### Logging and Chaos Testing

**Logging:**
Well-engineered logging is crucial for application design. Consistent, easy-to-process, and sufficiently-detailed logging enables operations teams to respond quickly to incidents, leading to faster detection and resolution. Alongside logging, quick access to inventory is also important.

**Chaos Testing:**
Chaos testing is a type of Business Continuity Planning (BCP) or disaster recovery (DR) practice often handled via automation. For example, a virtual machine with valid administrative credentials in the production network can cause intentional disasters. Chaos engineering includes various approaches, such as red teams creating chaos, scheduling programmed machine shutdowns, or sending authenticated malicious platform API commands. The goal is to test controls in messy and unpredictable situations. If a production system can handle chaos gracefully, it indicates robustness and resilience to security threats.

### Cybersecurity Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Frameworks

#### 3.5.1 Laws and Regulations

- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996):** A U.S. federal law regulating health care coverage and the privacy of patient health information (PHI). It includes the Privacy Rule, which sets limits on what information can be shared without patient consent, and the Security Rule, which outlines how electronic PHI (e-PHI) must be protected. HIPAA also requires notification in the event of a PHI breach.
- **FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974):** A U.S. federal law regulating the privacy of learners’ education records. It sets limits on the disclosure and use of these records and grants parents and learners over 18 certain rights over their information.
- **GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999):** A U.S. law requiring financial institutions to protect consumers’ financial information. It mandates that institutions describe how they use and share information and allow individuals to opt out in certain cases.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** A European Union law adopted in 2016 that regulates data privacy and security. It applies to entities collecting or processing data related to people in the EU, regardless of the entity’s location. GDPR provides individuals with rights over their data, including the right to be forgotten and other rights related to data breaches and portability.
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018):** A Californian law granting residents certain privacy rights concerning personal information held by for-profit businesses. It includes the right to know, the right to opt-out, and the right to delete personal information.

#### 3.5.2 Standards and Frameworks

- **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):** An information security standard for organizations handling customer payment data. It consists of requirements for network and system security, access control, vulnerability management, and monitoring.
- **CIS Top 18 (Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls):** A set of 18 recommended controls to increase an organization’s security posture. These controls are divided into safeguards grouped into three implementation groups (IG1, IG2, IG3) to help prioritize implementation.
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** A collection of standards and practices designed to help organizations understand and reduce cybersecurity risk. It consists of three components: Core, Implementation Tiers, and Profiles.
- **MITRE ATT&CK and D3FEND:** The MITRE ATT&CK framework catalogs how attackers infiltrate systems, while D3FEND provides best practices and methodologies for defenders to prevent, detect, mitigate, and react to attacks.
- **Cyber Kill Chain:** A methodology developed by Lockheed Martin to identify and defend against cyber attacks. It outlines seven stages: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives.
- **FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program):** A U.S. program providing a standardized security framework for cloud services used by the federal government. It allows a cloud service to obtain a single authorization for all government agencies.
