www.alexa.com at the time of the measurements (Alexa rank of 75, August 1,
2008). From the initial screen scrape we obtained 1,690 tracker addresses. Sec-
ond, we scraped all the 1,690 trackers for peer and download information of all
the torrents they maintain. This allowed us to eﬃciently obtain the number of
leechers, seeds, and completed downloads as seen by each tracker. We performed
the tracker-scrapes weekly from Sept. 15, 2008, to Aug. 17, 2009, the same 48-
week period as the University measurements. All scrapes were performed at 8pm
GMT. We removed redundant tracker information for trackers that share infor-
mation about the same swarms of peers, and identiﬁed 721 independent trackers.
3.4 Overlap between Datasets
During our 48-week measurement period, the University users used BitTorrent
to download 56, 963 unique ﬁles, while the 721 unique trackers maintained state
information about 11.2M unique torrents. Using the mininova screen scrapes,
we obtained ﬁle size and category information for 911, 687 distinct ﬁles. Table 1
summarizes our datasets.
While the local peers contacted 2, 371 diﬀerent trackers (about 3 times as many
as the monitored trackers), a total of 45, 404 ﬁles (93.1% of all ﬁles observed lo-

cally) are observed in both the local and the global datasets. This large overlap
is due to the extensive global dataset and the high skew in tracker usage. This is
illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the number of ﬁles and downloads associated
with each tracker. The lines in this ﬁgure clearly have Zipf-like characteristics, sug-
gesting that a few of the trackers are responsible for much of the load generated
by the University. However, there is also a long tail of trackers that are responsible
for a signiﬁcant fraction of the total load (although each of these trackers is not
responsible for much of the load). Finally, two screen scrapes (one at the begin-
ning and one at the end of the measurement period) provide the ﬁle size statistics
and category information for 16, 119 (33.1%) of these ﬁles.
4 Content Download Characteristics
We ﬁrst take a closer look at the diﬀerences in the downloaded content. Figure 2
shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the ﬁle sizes observed in
the two datasets. While the majority of downloads in both datasets are for
ﬁles between 100 MB and 10 GB, there is a very large diﬀerence in the ﬁle
size distributions. Overall, the ﬁles downloaded in the University network are
much bigger. (Note that x-axis is in log scale.) This diﬀerence suggests that
globally, many users have lower access bandwidths than the relatively high access
bandwidths of the local university users. As a result, the global users may be
more reluctant to download larger ﬁles.
Figure 3 shows the number of downloads per category in each dataset. The
categories used here are those deﬁned by Mininova. Figure 3 shows that the
university users download a much larger fraction of movies and TV shows (i.e.,
video) than the global users, which download a lot more music (these tend to be
much smaller ﬁles). This further explains the large diﬀerence in ﬁle sizes observed
locally and globally. To set these results in context, Figure 4 shows the ﬁle size
distributions for the ﬁve most downloaded ﬁle categories in our datasets. While
the distributions diﬀer signiﬁcantly between categories, all of the categories have
highly variable ﬁles sizes.
