With these changes, the implementation is sound in that
it will return true only when the original algorithm solving
the MDPs exactly returns true. However, the implementa-
tion may return false in cases where AUDIT would return
true. These additional results of false mean that additional
violations of exclusivity rules might go uncaught and addi-
tional compliance with prohibitive rules might go unproven.
However, since false indicates an inconclusive audit, they do
not alter soundness of the implementation.
We programmed our implementation and the example that
follows in the Racket dialect of Scheme. They are available
at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/∼mtschant/purpose/.
C. Example: Creating an Operating Procedure
In some environments, an auditee may have difﬁculty
determining whether an action is allowed under a policy.
For example, Regional Health Information Organizations
(RHIOs) store and make available medical records for a
region. Since RHIOs are a new technology and do not
directly provide treatment, arguments may arise over what
actions are allowed under the exclusivity restriction that
records may only be used for the purpose of treatment.

A physician considering reading such a record may ﬁnd
the circumstances too complex to understand without help,
but neither can we expect the physician to perform the
modeling required to use our auditing algorithm. However,
an RHIO may use our algorithm to audit simulated logs
of possible future uses and determine which actions the
restriction allows. The RHIO may generalize these quan-
titative results to a qualitative operating procedure, such as
the physician may read records of patients with whom he
does not have a current relationship only when seeing that
patient in the future is highly likely. Below, we show an
example of reasoning that could lead to this procedure.
Reading a patient’s record improves the ability of the
physician to treat the patient i by some amount δr
i. (r stands
for “read”.) Each patient i will seek treatment from the
physician with some probability pi. A simple model of an
RHIO modeling only these aspects would always allow the
physician to read the record of the patient i that maximizes
the expected improvement in treatment (pi ∗ δr
i). However, it
fails to account for the possibility that the physician studies
general medical literature that improves his ability to treat
all patients by some degree δs. (s stands for “study”.)
Since the values of pi, δr
i, and δs vary across circum-
stances, we formalize the above intuitions as a family of
MDPs varying in these and other factors. An additional
important factor is h, the physician’s memory span. For
simplicity, we assume that the number of patients in the
RHIO is equal to h as well, but we include the possibility of
seeing a patient not in the RHIO or not seeing any patient at
all. (Having more patients than the physician can remember
cannot change his behavior.)
Each state of an MDP in this family records the previous
h actions since reading records or studying can affect the
reward for treating a patient as many as h steps into the
future. From each state, the physician has the choice of doing
nothing, studying, reading a patient’s record, or treating a
patient when that patient is seeking treatment. These actions
result in a probabilistic transition since the identity of the
next patient (or the absence of one) is probabilistic.
We ran our implementation on 33 instances of this family
with h = 2 or h = 3 and the discounting factor γ ranging
from 0.01 to 0.9. For all instances, we set pi equal to a
single value for all i. This value pi ranged from 0.0001
to 0.01. The probability that the current patient is not in
the RHIO (denoted po) ranged over 0.8 to 0.9698. These
experiments showed that in most cases, reading a patient’s
record is allowed only when δr
δs.
However, when the discounting factor γ is large and the base
level of treatment small, reading may be justiﬁed at lower
values of δr
i. In this case, the physician may read records
even when a patient is waiting for treatment in hopes of
treating in the future a (possibly different) patient whose
record he has read.
i is greater than h∗pi+po
pi
Compliance ofﬁcers at an RHIO may ﬁnd these results
184
helpful while creating operating procedures. For example,
consider a large hospital where the odds of a physician see-
ing a typical patient is less than 1 in 10, 000. Our simulations
found for various models with pi = 0.0001 that δr
i must be
greater than about 9700δs. In many settings, managers may
ﬁnd inconceivable an improvement from reading a patient’s
record of 9700 times the improvement from studying. In this
case, an operating procedure may summarize these results
as prohibiting a physician from reading a patient’s record
unless the physician has a reason to believe that the patient
is much more likely than average to seek care.
Experiments’ Running Times: Since the number of
states in the MDP is (h + 2)h+3 + (h + 2)h+1, we focused
on small values of h. For the h = 2 cases (1088 states),
the running time for a single call of the approximate AUDIT
algorithm varied between 1.3 and 27 seconds. For the h = 3
cases (16, 250 states), it varied between 261 seconds and
70 minutes. The large range is because the running time is
pseudo-polynomial in γ. We used binary search to estimate
for each model how large the improvement δr
i had to be
before reading a record became acceptable. This search took
10 to 12 calls to AUDIT. We ran our implementation on a
Lenovo U110 with 3GB of memory and a 1.60 GHz Intel
Core 2 Duo CPU.
VI. EMPIRICAL STUDY OF SEMANTICS
Both prior work and this work offer methods for enforcing
privacy policies that feature purpose restrictions. These
methods test whether a sequence of actions violates a clause
of a privacy policy that restricts certain actions to be only for
certain purposes. By providing a test for whether the purpose
restriction is violated, these methods implicitly provide a
semantics for these restrictions.
To ensure that these methods correctly enforce the privacy
policy, one must show that the semantics employed by a
method matches the intended meaning of the policy. Since
policies often act as agreements among multiple parties
who may differ in their interpretation of the policy, we
compare the semantics proposed by these methods to the
most common interpretations of a policy using a survey.
While prior work has not provided a formal semantics, it
appears that many works (e.g., [11], [13]) ﬂag actions as a
violation if they do not further the purpose in question. (See
Section VII for a description of prior work.) In particular,
these works make assumptions about how people think
about purpose in the context of enforcing a privacy policy
that restricts an agent to only performing a certain class
of actions for a certain purpose. The following hypothesis
characterizes these assumptions:
H1 (furthering). The agent obeys the restriction
if and only if the action furthered the purpose.
Our work instead asserts that an action may be for a purpose
even if that purpose is never furthered. Our formalism
assumes the following hypothesis instead:

H2 (planning). The auditee obeys the restriction
if and only if the auditee performed that action as
part of a plan for furthering that purpose.
(Our algorithm is an approximation based on Hypothesis H2
while using only observable information.)
To show that our work provides a method of enforcing
purpose restrictions more faithful to their common meaning,
we disprove Hypothesis H1 while supporting Hypothesis H2.
We tested both of these hypotheses by providing example
scenarios of an auditee performing actions with descriptions
of his plans. To provide more evidence for the truth of Hy-
pothesis H2, we also tested the following related hypothesis:
H2c. Describing an action as being part of a plan
for furthering purpose as opposed to not being part
of such a plan in a scenario causes people to think
that the auditee obeyed the restriction.
H2c is a causal version of H2. Unlike H2, which may be
tested with unrelated scenarios, H2c must be tested with
scenarios that only differ from one another in whether the
action is part of a plan for the purpose in question. We also
tested the causal version of H1, called H1c.
A. Survey Construction
We constructed a questionnaire with four scenarios that
are identical except for varying in two factors: (1) whether or
not the action furthers the purpose in question in the scenario
and (2) whether or not the auditee performs the action as
part of a plan for furthering the purpose. The four scenarios
are (with repeated text elided for Sp¯f , S¯pf , and S¯p¯f ):
Spf . A case worker employed by Metropolis General
Hospital meets with a patient. The case worker
develops a plan with the sole goal of treating the
patient. The plan includes sharing the patient’s
medical record with an outside specialist. Upon
receiving the record,
the specialist succeeds in
treating the patient.
. . .The case worker develops a plan with the sole
goal of treating the patient. . . .the specialist did not
succeed in treating the patient.
. . .The case worker develops a plan with the sole
goal of reducing costs for the hospital.
. . .the
specialist succeeds in treating the patient.
. . .The case worker develops a plan with the sole
goal of reducing costs for the hospital.
. . .the
specialist did not succeed in treating the patient.
S¯p¯f .
Sp¯f .
S¯pf .
(E.g., S¯pf stands for the scenario that was not planned (¯p)
for the purpose but furthered (f) it.) The auditee in these
four scenarios is subject to the following exclusivity rule:
Metropolis General Hospital and its employees
will share a patient’s medical record with an
outside specialist only for the purpose of providing
that patient with treatment.
185
For each scenario, we asked each participant the ﬁve fol-
lowing questions:
Q1. Did the case worker obey the above privacy policy?
Q2. Why did you answer [Q1] as you did?
Q3. Did the case worker share the record with the
specialist for the purpose of treatment?
Q4. Was the goal of the case worker’s plan to treat the
patient?
Q5. Did the specialist succeed in treating the patient?
For each question except Q2, the participant selected among
yes, no, and I don’t know. Question Q2 required a free form
response.
The responses to Question Q1 determines the truth of
Hypotheses H1 and H2. We conjectured that the majority
of participants would answer this question with yes for the
Scenarios Spf and Sp¯f , and with no for S¯pf and S¯p¯f . Ques-
tion Q2 provides insight into the participant’s reasoning and
discourages arbitrary responses. We included Question Q3 to
help determine whether the questionnaire was well worded.
Questions Q4 and Q5 have objectively correct answers
that the participant can easily ﬁnd by reading the scenarios.
Checking that
the participant chose the correct answer
allowed us to ensure that the participants actually read the
scenario and answered accordingly. On the questionnaire,
we ordered the questions as follows: Q4, Q5, Q3, Q1, Q2.
We used Amazon Mechanical Turk (www.mturk.com) to
recruit 200 participants with a payment of $0.50 (USD).
We randomly ordered the scenarios for each participant. We
decided before the survey to exclude from the results any
participants who got more than one of the Questions Q4
and Q5 wrong in total across all four scenarios.
B. Statistical Modeling
Hypotheses H1 and H2 each make predictions about
whether Question Q1 will be answered with yes or no. We
model these answers as a draw from a binomial distribution
(a series of coin ﬂips) and we interpret the hypotheses as
predictions about probability of success for the binomial
distribution (how biased the coins are). We interpret a
prediction that a question will be answered with a certain
response as an assertion that
the probability of success
(seeing that response) is at least 0.5.
For example, one prediction of the furthering hypothe-
sis H1 is that people will respond to Question Q1 with yes
under Scenario S¯pf . That is, it predicts that p¯pfy ≥ 0.5 where
p¯pfy is the probability of a participant responding with yes to
Question Q1 for Scenario S¯pf (i.e., the success parameter to
the binomial distribution). If we see a small number of yes
responses, we may reject this prediction providing evidence
against H1. By common convention, the number of yes
responses must be so small that the probability of seeing
that number or fewer under the assumption that p¯pfy ≥ 0.5
is true is less than α = 0.05 (the signiﬁcance level).

To test the causal hypotheses H1c and H2c, we must
compare the responses across scenarios. These responses
are not independent since the same participant produces
responses for both scenarios. We use McNemar’s test to ex-
amine the number of respondents who change their answers
to Question Q1 across a pair of scenarios [29]. McNemar’s
test approximates the probability of the number of switches
being produced by two dependent draws from one distribu-
tion. If this probability is small (less than α = 0.05), then
we may conclude that the switch between scenarios affected
the respondents’ answers.
For example, for the causal planning hypothesis H2c, we
compare the responses to Question Q1 across the Scenar-
ios Spf and S¯pf , which differ only in the case worker’s
planning. If we ﬁnd that a large number of participants have
different responses across the two scenarios, then we can
conclude that the case worker’s planning does have an effect.
C. Results
While we only offered to pay the ﬁrst 200 participants,
we received 207 completed surveys. The extra surveys may
have resulted from people misunderstanding the instructions
and not collecting payment.
Of these completed surveys, we excluded 20 participants
for missing two or more of the objective questions. All
of the statistics shown in this section are calculated from
the remaining 187 participants. Including the 20 excluded
