Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-give-your-
javascript-slot-machine-some-stylish-images has an issue. Please describe how
to reproduce it, and include links to screenshots if possible.
In this challenge, the step one of the solve condition "Use the provided code
three times. One for each slot" works on the premise the code
`$($('.slot')[0]).html('');` is copied
and entered three times. The solution is not solved if the user directly
enters in the correct solution without copying and pasting the code.  
This seems like an unnecessary step.
