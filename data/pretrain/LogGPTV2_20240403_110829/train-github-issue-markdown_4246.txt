**Current behavior**  
The parent component generates a component based on the supplied component
metadata. The lifecycle hooks of the generated component which in turn the
generated child component also generates another component is not
fired/called.
**Expected behavior**  
The lifecycle hooks defined in the nested generated components should be
fired.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
Reproduction Link: http://plnkr.co/edit/wRfKN5wynVC3LZKDVw1s?p=preview
The output should be:
    Hello Angular2
    Parent
    Child
    Foo
The current behavior is:
    Hello Angular2
    Parent
    Child
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
I have different kinds of modals (chart, alert, pdf viewer). One of them is a
modal that displays any kind of chart like line chart, bar chart etc. So
basically the parent acts as a modal component factory, the child is the chart
modal which in turn dynamically creates charts based on the supplied component
metadata.
