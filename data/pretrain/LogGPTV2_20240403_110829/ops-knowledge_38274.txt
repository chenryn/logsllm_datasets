User: I have been working with python for a while now. Recently I got into Sockets with Twisted which was good for learning Telnet, SSH, and Message Passing. I wanted to take an idea and implement it in a web fashion. A week of searching and all I can really do is create a resource that handles GET and POST all to itself. And this I am told is bad practice.
So The questions I have after one week:
* Are other options like Tornado and Standard Python Sockets a better (or more popular) approach?
* Should one really use separate resources in Twisted GET and POST operations?
* What is a good resource to start in this area of Python Development?  
My background with languages are C, Java, HTML/DHTML/XHTML/XML and my main systems (even home) are Linux.
Assistant: I'd recommend against building your own web server and handling raw socket calls to build web applications;  it makes much more sense to just write your web services as wsgi applications and use an existing web server, whether it's something like tornado or apache with mod_wsgi.
