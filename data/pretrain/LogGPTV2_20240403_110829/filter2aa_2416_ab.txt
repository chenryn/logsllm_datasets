# Network Access Control (NAC) and Device Compliance

## Overview
Network Access Control (NAC) is a security approach that ensures devices comply with an organization's network access policy. Typically, only Microsoft Windows-based operating systems undergo the assessment process.

## Device Identification and Classification
### Importance of Device Identification
To determine whether a device should undergo the assessment process, it must be identified and classified by its operating system (OS). This classification can be achieved through various methods:

- **Client-based software**
- **Active OS detection**
- **Passive OS detection**
- **Java scripts on captive portals**
- **Other methods**

### Bypassing Device Classification
The process of classifying a device can sometimes be circumvented. For example, the Cisco NAC Appliance Agent Installation Bypass Vulnerability allows users to bypass the 'USER-AGENT' string, manipulate the TCP/IP OS stack, or enable personal firewalls. However, Cisco has stated that "users cannot bypass authentication using the approach described in the advisory."

### Assessment Methods
- **Client-based software**: Provides detailed information about the host and can detect changes in real-time.
  - **Strengths**:
    - Rich information about the host.
    - Real-time change detection.
  - **Weaknesses**:
    - Installation and management overhead.
    - Performance impact.
    - Security risks, as client-side measures are not always trustworthy.
- **Agent-less**: No need to install additional software, fast deployment, and easier custom checks.
  - **Strengths**:
    - Fast deployment.
    - No additional software installation.
  - **Weaknesses**:
    - Limited information availability.
    - Possible less granular data.
    - Communication vulnerabilities.
- **Dissolving Agent**: Available primarily for Microsoft operating systems and requires local administrator rights.

## Information Checked
### Local and Remote Checks
- **Local Checks**: Some information, such as registry values, can be easily spoofed.
- **Remote Checks**: The communication between the NAC agent and server can be an attack vector.

### Replay and S&S Attacks
- **Replay Attacks**: Sniffed data can be re-played to falsify the assessment process.
- **S&S Attack (Sniff & Spoof)**: Sniff the communications to learn the checked parameters and then spoof the response to get validated.

## Exceptions
### Definition and Use
Exceptions are defined for elements that cannot or should not participate in the NAC process. These include:
- Devices that cannot run certain software clients (e.g., 802.1x, non-Windows elements).
- Devices running specific operating systems (e.g., macOS, Linux).

### Implementation
- **Cisco Trust Agent (CTA)**: Hosts that cannot run CTA can be granted access using manually configured exceptions by MAC or IP address.
- **Symantec (Sygate)**: Non-Windows exceptions and MAC address-based exemption lists can be created.

## Quarantine
### Purpose and Implementation
An element that does not comply with the network access policy is placed in a quarantine, a temporary holding place until the policy violation is remediated. Access is typically restricted to remediation servers.

### Types of Quarantine
- **Shared Quarantine**: Allows quarantined elements to interact, making it a potential attack vector.
- **Private Quarantine**: Prevents interaction between quarantined elements, providing better security.

### Quarantine Methods
- **ACLs on switches/routers**
- **Dedicated subnets (e.g., DHCP Proxy)**
- **Dedicated VLANs (Quarantine VLAN)**
- **Private VLANs (PVLAN)**
- **Per switch port (hardware)**
- **Manipulating ARP cache entries at L2**

## Enforcement
### Definition and Methods
Enforcement involves blocking or restricting network access from non-compliant devices. It can be performed at Layer 3 (L3), Layer 2 (L2), and at the switch level.

- **L3 Enforcement**: Subject to bypass issues like assigning non-routable IP addresses.
- **L2 Enforcement**: More secure but may require network re-architecture.
- **Switch Level Enforcement**: Per-port per-device, often using 802.1x.

### Bypassing Enforcement
- **Symantec (Sygate)**: Specific examples of bypassing L3 enforcement.

## Conclusion
- **Market Confusion**: Many available NAC solutions can be bypassed and do not provide adequate access controls.
- **Serious Attitude**: There is a growing awareness of the pitfalls of various NAC solutions.
- **Considerations**: When implementing NAC, clearly define your objectives and understand the potential risks and limitations.
