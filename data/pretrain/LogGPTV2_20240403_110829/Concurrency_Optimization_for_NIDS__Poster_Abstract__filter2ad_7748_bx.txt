IROA fragmentation patterns are unique in two significant ways: 1) the ability to discriminate between fragment and artifact peaks in the MS-
MS spectra, and 2) the formula for every fragment is known However, the acquisition of IROA fragment patterns has always required the use 
of fragmentation windows wide enough to include the entire IROA peak cluster, but ideally no wider Since the width of each IROA peak cluster 
is determined by the number of carbons in the molecule, no single window width setting can be used  Using recursive DDA systems such as 
Thermo’s AquireX, or Agilent’s iDDA, have made it possible to acquire fragmentation scans for a majority of the individual peaks of an IROA cluster 
and then sum these fragmentation scans to synthesize what the wide window MS-MS scan would have shown In this poster we demonstrate the 
implementation of such a strategy The synthesized scans may be processed to exclude artifact peaks and determine formulae for all fragments 
These two factors provide for better compound identification, and structure elucidation if the identity of a peak is unknown While dot product 
calculations can still be performed on the synthetic scans, the availability and use of fragment formulae is cleaner and more accurately verifies 
compound identity We believe that this is the first use of the systematic synthesis of complex MS-MS scans from individual MS-MS scans We 
expect that many related, derivative applications will soon appear

Extractive Ratio Analysis NMR Spectroscopy for Improved Metabolite Identification in Complex Biological Mixtures
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Dan Raftery, University of Washington, United States
CO-AUTHORS: G.A. Nagana Gowda, Liladhar Paudel
The complexity of biological mixtures continues to challenge efforts aimed at unknown metabolite identification in the metabolomics field To 
address this challenge, we provide a new method to identify related peaks from individual metabolites in complex NMR spectra Extractive ratio 
analysis NMR spectroscopy (E-RANSY) builds on our previously described ratio analysis method which calculates a peak ratio divided by its 
standard deviation [Anal Chem 2011, 83, 7616-7623], such that peaks from the same molecule are enhanced and peaks from other metabolites are 
diminished Here, E-RANSY first creates simplified NMR spectra that result from liquid-liquid extraction of metabolites under varied pH conditions 
Under such conditions, metabolites from the same biological specimen are extracted differentially such that their signals vary dramatically across 
the sample set; the resulting NMR spectra exhibit characteristics favorable for unraveling unknown metabolite peaks using ratio analysis We 
demonstrate the utility of the E-RANSY method for the analysis of carboxylic acid containing metabolites in human urine E-RANSY performs better 
than correlation methods such as STOCSY as well as the original RANSY method, and offers new avenues to identify unknown metabolites in 
complex biological mixtures We will also discuss the development and optimization of the algorithm for RANSY and ways to expand its utility, such 
as using it to deconvolute MS data and for bridging the gap between NMR and MS spectra of the same sample for improved unknown detection

Advantages and limitations of Orbitrap GC-MS in metabolomics research
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Daniel Stettin, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Georg Pohnert
The annotation of unknown compounds represents the current bottleneck in MS-based metabolomics research (Viant et al, 2017) LC-MS based 
metabolomics has received a boost in that regard with the introduction of the Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS (Alvarez-Rivera et al, 2019) The later 
introduced Q-Exactive Orbitrap GC-MS has remained fairly unexplored in its potential for metabolomics research In this work, we set out to assess 
what level of insight into the metabolome of a non-model organism the GC-Orbitrap can provide We devised a simple comparative metabolomics 
experiment involving an osmotic stress treatment on a unicellular algae and ran the samples both on a nominal mass GC-MS as well as the GC-
Orbitrap Resulting data was compared in regards to data quality, degree of putative annotation and the potential to identify unknowns Herein we 
show that the accurate mass provided by the GC-Orbitrap does not improve compound annotation when combined with traditionally used EI-
database matching but does enhance current annotation techniques (Lai et al, 2017) We successfully identify more than 50% of the dysregulated 
compounds found on both platforms Still, the majority of unknowns remain unannotated despite the plethora of structural information provided 
by the GC-Orbitrap These results show the potential of the Orbitrap mass analyzer for GC-MS based metabolomics but also reveal a lack of 
computational support currently hampering the rapid annotation of unknowns

Differentiation of positional isomers of drug metabolites using infrared ion spectroscopy
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Rianne van Outersterp, FELIX Laboratory, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Giel Berden, Valerie Koppen, Filip Cuyckens, Jos Oomens, Jonathan Martens
An understanding of the metabolism of drug candidates, including the identification of downstream drug metabolites, is a crucial step in drug 
development Due to its high sensitivity and selectivity, mass spectrometry (MS) is often the analytical method of choice However, closely related 
compounds may be hard to distinguish using (tandem) MS alone, as these are often isobaric and give identical fragmentation mass spectra 
Alternative methods involving expensive and time-consuming purification steps are usually needed to confidently resolve full molecular structures 
Infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS) records an IR spectrum of a mass-selected gas-phase ion directly inside a mass spectrometer The IR fingerprint 
is highly sensitive to molecular structure, and can be recorded for each m/z-feature detected in a standard MS experiment We exploit this 
technique, which has full MS sensitivity and compatibility, to identify small molecules resulting from untargeted MS-based experiments, including 
drug metabolites Here, we explore the use of IRIS for the differentiation of positional isomers resulting from the phase I metabolism reactions 
(usually oxidation, reduction or hydrolysis) that introduce a reactive or polar group on a phenyl ring in a drug molecule The chemical modification 
that occurs can usually be determined from the mass spectrum, but the exact site of biotransformation often remains unknown We demonstrate 
how metabolites bearing a ortho-, meta- or para-hydroxylation can be distinguished based on their IR spectra Also, we show that identification is 
possible on the basis of spectra predicted by quantum-chemical calculations, opening opportunities for reference-standard free identification

One of the key problems in metabolomics is identification from few analytical parameters, within the wide range of compounds that comprises 
the metabolome Steroidomics is a salient example of this problematic, facing the additional difficulty of dealing with a set of molecules with very 
similar structures, and so they are the perfect testing ground for new approaches Liquid chromatography (LC) is often the method of choice for 
metabolite separation, but such structural similarity can be compromising for this separation due to the consequently similar physico-chemical 
properties The problem is usually overcome by careful tuning of the mobile phase gradient, to focus the separation on compounds of interest 
However, in a standard workflow this is highly problematic for annotation It requires characterizing a library of known compounds for every fine-
tuned configuration We present a software solution, DynaStI, capable of annotating LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) features 
by dynamically generating the retention times from a database containing intrinsic properties for a library of metabolites In this way, the chemical 
characterization of the library only needs to be performed once, and the generated retention times are adapted to the parameters of each gradient 
on the fly We study the influence of experimental vs in-silico compound properties on the quality of the prediction and the annotation, and we 
introduce a calibration mechanism to increase accuracy and compensate for deviations in the input parameters We run tests on both standards and 
real samples, and observe that the algorithm produces reliable predictions, suitable for metabolomics compound annotation

There is a growing interest towards using saliva as a non-invasive sample material for monitoring health and disease status to assist diagnosis or 
studying molecular mechanisms of disease pathologies Same applies to domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) which suffer from similar diseases 
like humans having eg diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and cancer Human saliva is known to be rich in small molecules, but there is no data 
available for dog saliva metabolome even though a dog is also a modern model for human diseases The present study investigated metabolite 
composition of stimulated saliva samples collected from 13 privately-owned dogs and 14 human individuals We applied non-targeted metabolomics 
method based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry Complementary 
methods, reverse phase and hydrophilic interaction chromatography were used with both, positive and negative ionization, to cover a broad 
repertory of compounds Metabolite identification was accomplished using MS-DIAL software and both in-house and open-source libraries With 
this approach, > 200 metabolites were identified revealing distinct metabolic profile in dog and human saliva The biggest differences between 
species were found among lipids and small peptides Other identified metabolites were amino acids, amino acid derivatives, biogenic amines, 
nucleic acid subunits, organic acids and other metabolites, such as general waste products In addition, some exogenous compounds were 
identified Further studies are needed to evaluate the utility of saliva as a diagnostic material for canine health monitoring with possibilities to 
benefit dog as well as human health in the future

A wide variety of analytical methods have been developed for targeted metabolomics By combining multiple techniques, it is now possible to 
achieve much more comprehensive coverage of a sample’s metabolome However, the precision, accuracy, and level of metabolome coverage 
of different platforms is often not well known To answer these questions we chose to comprehensively characterize a widely-studied biofluid 
sample (human pooled plasma, NIST Standard Reference Material, SRM 1950) using 12 different targeted assays conducted on 8 different analytical 
platforms The platforms included NMR (700 and 800 MHz), direct injection/liquid chromatography tandem mass (QTrap) spectrometry (DI/LC-MS/
MS), LC-MS with isotope-labeled internal standards (LC-MRM-MS), LC–coupled with high-resolution mass (Orbitrap) spectrometry (LC-HRMS), 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), two-dimensional gas chromatography mass (QTOF) spectrometry (GCxGC-TOF MS) and 
capillary electrophoresis with ultraviolet (CE-UV) and mass spectrometry (CE-MS) A total of 860 quantitative measurements for 628 metabolites 
were obtained from the 12 different analytical assays Another 81 metabolites are identified (but not quantified) For metabolites quantified by more 
than one method, the measured concentrations were compared between methods and against either NIST reference data or known reference 
ranges from the literature Most assayed metabolites showed excellent cross-platform agreement (10-15%) Clear differences in platform coverage 
and sensitivity are evident This represents the most complete quantitative characterization of SRM 1950 It also provides high-confidence reference 
values for SRM 1950 that should allow other research labs to calibrate their assays Furthermore, this work gives important insights into the 
strengths and weaknesses of different metabolomic platforms/assays for plasma/serum analysis

Machine-learning based spectral similarity measures to better identify different yet related compounds from large 
metabolomic datasets.
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Florian Huber, Netherlands eScience Center, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Justin J.J. van der Hooft, Simon Rogers, Lars Ridder
Extensive high-throughput mass spectrometry has become an important tool in many areas of life sciences and medicine Analyzing and interpreting 
the resulting complex mass spectral data remains a challenging task, in particular for mixtures containing large numbers of unidentified compounds 
One key challenge in extracting useful information from such data is to determine if spectra belong to identical or similar molecules This is typically 
done by deriving spectral similarity scores, currently often based on comparing (intensities for matching) peak positions, for instance by calculating 
a modified cosine score (as used in GNPS molecular networking) Those measures work well for spectra obtained for very similar compounds, but 
often perform poorly when used to find similarities between spectra of notably different yet related compounds This is assessed by using Tanimoto 
coefficients between molecular fingerprints from a large set (>10,000) of MS/MS reference spectra as benchmark We here propose a number of 
alternative approaches for measuring spectral similarity which are based on established machine-learning algorithms including techniques adapted 
from natural language processing, but also PCA and deep autoencoders We will present several measures that outperform the modified cosine score 
in selecting spectra from structurally closely related molecules in datasets containing potentially unknown compounds We further find that some of 
the presented measures show complementary characteristics which can either be combined or be used to address different types of similarity Taken 
together, we conclude that these novel spectral similarity measures are a promising alternative for established measures

SIRIUS 4 - Turning tandem mass spectra into metabolite structure information
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Marcus Ludwig, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Kai Dührkop, Markus Fleischauer, Martin A. Hoffmann, Juho Rousu, Sebastian Böcker
Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is one of the predominant experimental platforms for untargeted metabolomics, 
but searching acquired tandem spectra in spectral libraries will only identify a small portion of the measured metabolites Here, we present the new 
release of the SIRIUS software SIRIUS 4 is the best-in-class software method for de novo molecular formula annotation and structure elucidation 
SIRIUS 4 integrates high-resolution isotope pattern analysis and fragmentation trees for molecular formula identification CSI:FingerID is seamlessly 
integrated via a RESTful webservice to search MS/MS spectra in a molecular structure database SIRIUS 4 has a novel isotope pattern scoring Using 
a deep neural network, SIRIUS detects rare elements from the isotope pattern The running times of SIRIUS were reduced by more than two orders 
of magnitude CSI:FingerID is now supporting negative ion mode spectra and integrates new kernels and fingerprints for a better identification 
performance Users can search in custom suspect databases or view the substructure recommendations for manual structure elucidation In 
evaluation on the Agilent MassHunter database the number of correct molecular formula annotations solely based on the isotope pattern increased 
by 743% compared to predecessor SIRIUS 3 On 208 compounds from the CASMI 2016 challenge, SIRIUS 4 correctly identified the molecular 
formula in 9375% of the cases Out of the 127 compounds in positive ion mode CSI:FingerID correctly identified 575% of the structures when 
searching in PubChem and 74% when searching in a smaller database of 05 million structures of biological interest The best competitor correctly 
identified 3622%

Integrated NMR and LC-MS based metabolomics approach for biomarker identification for radiation exposure
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ruchi Baghel, Division of Behavioral Neuroscience, INMAS, DRDO, India
CO-AUTHORS: Kiran Maan, and Poonam Rana
In the event of an intentional or accidental release of ionizing radiation in a densely populated area, timely assessment and triage of the general 
population for radiation exposure is critical Despite decades of research, counter measures still lack In this study, we describe the potential of 
integrated NMR and LC-MS approaches in evaluating the radiation biomarkers Untargeted profiling by means of broad-spectrum, highly sensitive, 
UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS provides a comprehensive list of metabolites at one go in a single biofluid Present study aims to discover new, as well as 
validate the previously identified metabolic signatures for whole-body irradiation in mice The study comprised 33 C57BL6 male (8-10 weeks) 
mice distributed as 5Gy, 75Gy and controls having 11 each and irradiated through60Co gamma source Urine samples collected post24 hrswere 
run in both ESI positive and negative mode All the data were normalized by sum and were than pareto-scaled followed by multivariate analysis 
including PCA and PLS-DA Of the total 1514 (positive) and 1764 (negative) peaks univariate analysis(t-test, p<005significant) revealed a total of 658 
significant (positive) molecules with creatinine (p=98x10-5) and L-carnitine (p=36x10-8)from 5Gy whereas betaine (p=20x10-4), 8-hydroxyquinone 
(p=96x10-5) and L-carnitine (p=34x10-5) from 75 Gy Out of 537 significant (negative) molecules taurine (47x10-4) and Quinnolinic acid (63x10-4) 
were from 5Gy Present study thus validates our previously (NMR) reported significant metabolites citric acid, hippuric acid and taurine The results 
thus lay foundation for high-througput triaging by metabolomic biomarkers for effective medical management Further pathway analysis also 
reveled results

ASICS: identification and quantification of metabolites in complex 1D 1H NMR spectra
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Gaëlle Lefort, INRA, France
CO-AUTHORS: Laurence Liaubet, Hélène Quesnel, Cécile Canlet, Nathalie Vialaneix, Rémi Servien
1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a high-throughput technology that allows to obtain metabolomic profile from easy-to-obtain fluids (such 
as blood) at moderate cost It is thus a promising tool to detect practically usable biomarkers However, its interpretation can be hard to make, 
because metabolites present from the 1H NMR spectrum of a complex mixture are often identified and quantified only from expert knowledge To 
facilitate the use of such data, we developed a new R package, ASICS, that implements a method for the automatic identification and quantification 
of metabolites in 1H NMR spectra The package combines all the steps of the analysis (management of a reference library with pure metabolite 
spectra, preprocessing, quantification, diagnosis tools to assess the quality of the quantification, post-quantification statistical analyses) The latest 
developments allow to improve alignment algorithm and quantification using information coming from all spectra of the same study To assess 
the performance of ASICS, data from PORCINET (ANR-09-GENM-005) were used Both the quantification and its impact on a post-quantification 
differential analysis were evaluated Correlations between ASICS relative quantifications and biochemical dosages of three metabolites were 
computed and a similar analysis was performed with other quantification methods like Autofit or batman These comparisons showed that ASICS 
allows for a faster and simpler direct biological interpretation than the classical bucket approach and obtains more precisely identified and 
quantified metabolites than other quantification methods ASICS is released as an R/Bioconductor package

High accuracy of retention time prediction for plant food bioactives using PredRet
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Claudine Manach, INRA, France
CO-AUTHORS: Low D, Micheau P, Abranko L., Bronze M., Hanhineva K., Koistinen V., Stanstrup J, Manach C
Plant food bioactives receive widespread interest for their protective health effects However, due to their huge chemical diversity and the lack 
of chemical standards for many of their phase I, –II and microbial metabolites, their identification in untargeted metabolomics profiles of food or 
biofluids remains a challenging feat Retention time (RT) is a valuable information for assisting the identification as it helps to narrow the number of 
hypotheses within an observed RT window to a manageable number of compounds to purchase or synthesize for confirmation In the framework 
of the COST Action FA1403 POSITIVe (https://www6inrafr/cost-positive, we evaluated the usefulness of PredRet (http://predretorg), an open 
access RT database, to predict RT of plant food bioactive metabolites in a multi-laboratory test involving 18 laboratories and 24 reversed-phase 
Chromatographic Systems (CS=column + elution phases and gradient) Participants shared datasets of RT in their own CS for 29 to 104 compounds, 
covering a total of 471 chemicals, including highly polar to lipophilic aglycones, glycosides, conjugated and microbial metabolites of flavonoids, 
phenolic acids, alkaloids, and others Depending on its comparability with other CSs, every platform obtained predicted RTs for 67 to 667 
compounds that were not analysed in their conditions The predictions were very accurate, with a median prediction error ranging from 003 to 076 
min Such level of prediction allowed distinguishing isomeric compounds It also provided information in all CSs for rare standards In conclusion, RT 
prediction with PredRet has proven very useful to facilitate annotation of plant food bioactives in metabolomics studies

Metabolic effects of dietary glycerol supplementation in muscle and liver of European seabass and rainbow trout by  
1H NMR metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mariana Palma, Universidade de Coimbra, Portugal
CO-AUTHORS: Ludgero C Tavares, João Rito, Luís F Henriques, Paulo Rema, Leonardo J Magnoni, Ivan Viegas
The sustainable development of aquaculture is still dependent in the substitution of fishmeal for alternative ingredients, especially for carnivorous 
fish, such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) Glycerol has been already used as an alternative 
energy source in diets for farmed animals, sparing amino acids to other functions such as growth The aim of the work was to evaluate the effects of 
dietary glycerol supplementation in rainbow trout and European seabass muscle and liver metabolome Fish were fed diets with 0%, 25% and 5% 
glycerol, muscle and liver were collected, and tissue aqueous fraction was extracted 1H-Presat and CPMG spectra were acquired for each muscle 
and liver sample, respectively, on a Varian VNMRS 600 MHz spectrometer Both untargeted and targeted approached were followed applying 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and univariate statistical analysis, respectively PCA plot scores showed scarce differences in muscle and liver 
metabolite composition in both species, regardless of the treatment Regarding univariate analysis, European seabass had more variations in the 
muscle and liver metabolome than rainbow trout European seabass presented changes generally related with protein biosynthesis pathways, while 
in rainbow trout variations were associated with choline-related metabolism Albeit rainbow trout seems to be more suitable to be fed with these 
dietary glycerol percentages, the tested diets have the potential to be used in aquaculture production NMR-Metabolomics approach proved to be 
adequate to be applied in these studies, providing a quick global overview of the results and also enabling the general tissue metabolite profiling

Deciphering complex metabolite mixtures remains a challenging task Key reasons for this are the complexity and sheer number of information-
rich mass fragmentation spectra hampering quick dereplication of known molecules and prioritization of novel chemistry Here, however, we will 
take advantage of this information-richness by using computational approaches that discover spectral similarities and mass spectral patterns 
corresponding to the biochemical building blocks of molecules here termed substructures We highlight recent advances that integrate existing 
metabolome mining tools with annotation tools such as Network Annotation Propagation as well as tools that specifically annotate possible peptidic 
spectra This eases the interpretation of large mass spectral molecular networks For example, we used the ClassyFire chemical classification 
ontology to annotate molecular families (MFs) observed in large MS/MS data collections This could help to prioritize relevant MFs In bacterial 
data, we could quickly assess how many peptidic MFs were present New structural variants of the cyclic peptide Xenoamicin were found and
