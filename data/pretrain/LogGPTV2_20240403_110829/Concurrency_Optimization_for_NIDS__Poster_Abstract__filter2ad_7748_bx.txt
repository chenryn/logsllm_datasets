### P-531: IROA Fragmentation Patterns for Enhanced Compound Identification
**Presenting Author:** Chris Beecher, IROA Technologies, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Felice de Jong, Alexander Raskind, Philip L. Lorenzi, Lucas J. Veillon

**Abstract:**
IROA (Isotopic Ratio Outlier Analysis) fragmentation patterns are unique in two significant ways: 1) the ability to distinguish between fragment and artifact peaks in MS/MS spectra, and 2) the formula for every fragment is known. However, acquiring IROA fragment patterns has traditionally required wide fragmentation windows to include the entire IROA peak cluster, which can vary in width based on the number of carbons in the molecule. 

Recursive DDA (Data-Dependent Acquisition) systems, such as Thermo’s AcquireX or Agilent’s iDDA, have made it possible to acquire fragmentation scans for most individual peaks within an IROA cluster. These scans can then be summed to synthesize a wide window MS/MS scan. This approach allows for the exclusion of artifact peaks and the determination of fragment formulas, enhancing compound identification and structure elucidation.

While dot product calculations can still be performed on the synthetic scans, the use of fragment formulas provides a cleaner and more accurate method for verifying compound identity. We believe this is the first systematic synthesis of complex MS/MS scans from individual MS/MS scans. We anticipate that many related, derivative applications will soon emerge.

### P-532: Extractive Ratio Analysis NMR Spectroscopy for Improved Metabolite Identification in Complex Biological Mixtures
**Presenting Author:** Dan Raftery, University of Washington, United States  
**Co-Authors:** G.A. Nagana Gowda, Liladhar Paudel

**Abstract:**
The complexity of biological mixtures continues to challenge efforts aimed at identifying unknown metabolites in the metabolomics field. To address this, we present a new method called Extractive Ratio Analysis NMR Spectroscopy (E-RANSY). E-RANSY builds on our previously described ratio analysis method, which calculates a peak ratio divided by its standard deviation, enhancing peaks from the same molecule while diminishing those from other metabolites.

E-RANSY first creates simplified NMR spectra through liquid-liquid extraction of metabolites under varied pH conditions. Under these conditions, metabolites from the same biological specimen are extracted differentially, leading to dramatic variations in their signals across the sample set. The resulting NMR spectra exhibit characteristics favorable for unraveling unknown metabolite peaks using ratio analysis.

We demonstrate the utility of E-RANSY for analyzing carboxylic acid-containing metabolites in human urine. E-RANSY outperforms correlation methods like STOCSY and the original RANSY method, offering new avenues for identifying unknown metabolites in complex biological mixtures. We also discuss the development and optimization of the RANSY algorithm and its potential for deconvoluting MS data and bridging the gap between NMR and MS spectra for improved unknown detection.

### P-533: Advantages and Limitations of Orbitrap GC-MS in Metabolomics Research
**Presenting Author:** Daniel Stettin, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Georg Pohnert

**Abstract:**
The annotation of unknown compounds is a major bottleneck in MS-based metabolomics research. While LC-MS-based metabolomics has benefited from the introduction of the Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS, the Q-Exactive Orbitrap GC-MS remains relatively unexplored.

In this study, we assessed the potential of the GC-Orbitrap for metabolomics research using a simple comparative metabolomics experiment involving osmotic stress treatment on a unicellular algae. Samples were analyzed using both nominal mass GC-MS and the GC-Orbitrap. The resulting data were compared in terms of data quality, degree of putative annotation, and the potential to identify unknowns.

Our results show that the accurate mass provided by the GC-Orbitrap does not improve compound annotation when combined with traditional EI-database matching but enhances current annotation techniques. We successfully identified more than 50% of the dysregulated compounds found on both platforms. Despite the structural information provided by the GC-Orbitrap, the majority of unknowns remain unannotated, highlighting the need for better computational support.

### P-534: Differentiation of Positional Isomers of Drug Metabolites Using Infrared Ion Spectroscopy
**Presenting Author:** Rianne van Outersterp, FELIX Laboratory, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Giel Berden, Valerie Koppen, Filip Cuyckens, Jos Oomens, Jonathan Martens

**Abstract:**
Understanding the metabolism of drug candidates, including the identification of downstream drug metabolites, is crucial in drug development. Mass spectrometry (MS) is often the method of choice due to its high sensitivity and selectivity. However, closely related compounds, such as positional isomers, can be difficult to distinguish using (tandem) MS alone, as they are often isobaric and give identical fragmentation mass spectra.

Infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS) records an IR spectrum of a mass-selected gas-phase ion directly inside a mass spectrometer. The IR fingerprint is highly sensitive to molecular structure and can be recorded for each m/z feature detected in a standard MS experiment. We exploit this technique to identify small molecules, including drug metabolites, resulting from untargeted MS-based experiments.

Here, we explore the use of IRIS for differentiating positional isomers resulting from phase I metabolism reactions, such as oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis, which introduce reactive or polar groups on a phenyl ring in a drug molecule. We demonstrate how metabolites bearing ortho-, meta-, or para-hydroxylation can be distinguished based on their IR spectra. Additionally, we show that identification is possible based on spectra predicted by quantum-chemical calculations, opening opportunities for reference-standard-free identification.

### P-535: DynaStI: A Dynamic Database for LC-MS Annotation in Metabolomics
**Presenting Author:** Santiago Codesido, Université de Genève, Switzerland  
**Co-Authors:** Giuseppe Marco Randazzo, Fabio Lehmann, Víctor González-Ruiz, Arnaud García, Ioannis Xenarios, Robin Liechti, Alan Bridge, Julien Boccard, Serge Rudaz

**Abstract:**
One of the key challenges in metabolomics is the identification of compounds from limited analytical parameters. Steroidomics, for example, faces the additional difficulty of dealing with structurally similar molecules. Liquid chromatography (LC) is often used for metabolite separation, but the structural similarity of these compounds can compromise the separation process.

To address this, we present DynaStI, a software solution capable of annotating LC-MS features by dynamically generating retention times from a database containing intrinsic properties for a library of metabolites. This approach allows for the chemical characterization of the library to be performed once, with generated retention times adapted to the parameters of each gradient on the fly.

We studied the influence of experimental versus in-silico compound properties on the quality of prediction and annotation and introduced a calibration mechanism to increase accuracy and compensate for deviations in input parameters. Tests on both standards and real samples showed that the algorithm produces reliable predictions suitable for metabolomics compound annotation.

### P-536: Comparison of the Metabolite Profiles of Human and Canine Saliva
**Presenting Author:** Soile Rummukainen, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, Finland  
**Co-Authors:** Jenni Puurunen, Olli Kärkkäinen, Seppo Auriola, Arja M. Kullaa, Hannes Lohi, Kati Hanhineva

**Abstract:**
Saliva is increasingly being used as a non-invasive sample material for monitoring health and disease status. This applies to both humans and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), which suffer from similar diseases such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. While human saliva is rich in small molecules, there is limited data available for dog saliva metabolomes.

In this study, we investigated the metabolite composition of stimulated saliva samples collected from 13 privately-owned dogs and 14 human individuals. We applied a non-targeted metabolomics method based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Complementary methods, including reverse phase and hydrophilic interaction chromatography, were used with both positive and negative ionization to cover a broad range of compounds.

Metabolite identification was accomplished using MS-DIAL software and both in-house and open-source libraries. Over 200 metabolites were identified, revealing distinct metabolic profiles in dog and human saliva. The largest differences were found among lipids and small peptides, with other identified metabolites including amino acids, amino acid derivatives, biogenic amines, nucleic acid subunits, organic acids, and general waste products. Some exogenous compounds were also identified. Further studies are needed to evaluate the utility of saliva as a diagnostic material for canine health monitoring, with potential benefits for both dog and human health.

### P-537: Quantitative Analysis of Over 600 Metabolites in NIST SRM 1950 Using Multiple Analytical Platforms
**Presenting Author:** Rupasri Mandal, University of Alberta, Canada  
**Co-Authors:** Jun Han, Paulina de la Mata, Xian Luo, Meera Shanmuganathan, Pascal Mercier, Rene Zahedi, Michael Overduin, James Harynuk, Philip Britz-McKibbon, Liang Li, Christoph H. Borchers, David S. Wishart

**Abstract:**
A variety of analytical methods have been developed for targeted metabolomics, and combining multiple techniques can provide comprehensive coverage of a sample's metabolome. However, the precision, accuracy, and level of metabolome coverage of different platforms are often not well understood.

To address this, we comprehensively characterized a widely-studied biofluid sample (human pooled plasma, NIST Standard Reference Material, SRM 1950) using 12 different targeted assays conducted on 8 different analytical platforms. These platforms included NMR (700 and 800 MHz), direct injection/liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (DI/LC-MS/MS), LC-MS with isotope-labeled internal standards (LC-MRM-MS), LC coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOF MS), and capillary electrophoresis with ultraviolet and mass spectrometry (CE-UV and CE-MS).

A total of 860 quantitative measurements for 628 metabolites were obtained from the 12 different analytical assays, with another 81 metabolites identified but not quantified. For metabolites quantified by more than one method, the measured concentrations were compared between methods and against either NIST reference data or known reference ranges from the literature. Most assayed metabolites showed excellent cross-platform agreement (10-15%). Clear differences in platform coverage and sensitivity were evident.

This represents the most complete quantitative characterization of SRM 1950 and provides high-confidence reference values for calibrating assays in other research labs. It also offers important insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different metabolomic platforms/assays for plasma/serum analysis.

### P-538: Machine-Learning Based Spectral Similarity Measures for Identifying Related Compounds in Large Metabolomic Datasets
**Presenting Author:** Florian Huber, Netherlands eScience Center, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Justin J.J. van der Hooft, Simon Rogers, Lars Ridder

**Abstract:**
High-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) has become a critical tool in life sciences and medicine, but analyzing and interpreting the resulting complex mass spectral data remains challenging, especially for mixtures containing large numbers of unidentified compounds. One key challenge is determining if spectra belong to identical or similar molecules, typically done by comparing peak positions and calculating modified cosine scores.

However, these measures often perform poorly when used to find similarities between spectra of notably different yet related compounds. We propose alternative approaches for measuring spectral similarity based on established machine-learning algorithms, including techniques adapted from natural language processing, PCA, and deep autoencoders. We present several measures that outperform the modified cosine score in selecting spectra from structurally closely related molecules in datasets containing potentially unknown compounds.

Some of the presented measures show complementary characteristics, which can be combined or used to address different types of similarity. We conclude that these novel spectral similarity measures are a promising alternative to established methods.

### P-539: SIRIUS 4 - Turning Tandem Mass Spectra into Metabolite Structure Information
**Presenting Author:** Marcus Ludwig, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Kai Dührkop, Markus Fleischauer, Martin A. Hoffmann, Juho Rousu, Sebastian Böcker

**Abstract:**
Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a predominant platform for untargeted metabolomics, but searching acquired tandem spectra in spectral libraries identifies only a small portion of the measured metabolites. Here, we present SIRIUS 4, a best-in-class software method for de novo molecular formula annotation and structure elucidation.

SIRIUS 4 integrates high-resolution isotope pattern analysis and fragmentation trees for molecular formula identification. CSI:FingerID is seamlessly integrated via a RESTful webservice to search MS/MS spectra in a molecular structure database. SIRIUS 4 uses a deep neural network to detect rare elements from the isotope pattern, significantly reducing running times. CSI:FingerID now supports negative ion mode spectra and integrates new kernels and fingerprints for better identification performance.

Users can search in custom suspect databases or view substructure recommendations for manual structure elucidation. Evaluation on the Agilent MassHunter database showed a 74.3% increase in correct molecular formula annotations based on isotope patterns compared to SIRIUS 3. On 208 compounds from the CASMI 2016 challenge, SIRIUS 4 correctly identified the molecular formula in 93.75% of cases. Out of 127 compounds in positive ion mode, CSI:FingerID correctly identified 57.5% of the structures when searching in PubChem and 74% when searching in a smaller database of 0.5 million structures of biological interest, outperforming the best competitor, which correctly identified 36.22%.

### P-540: Integrated NMR and LC-MS Based Metabolomics Approach for Biomarker Identification for Radiation Exposure
**Presenting Author:** Ruchi Baghel, Division of Behavioral Neuroscience, INMAS, DRDO, India  
**Co-Authors:** Kiran Maan, Poonam Rana

**Abstract:**
Timely assessment and triage of the general population for radiation exposure is critical in the event of an intentional or accidental release of ionizing radiation. In this study, we describe the potential of integrated NMR and LC-MS approaches in evaluating radiation biomarkers.

Untargeted profiling using UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS provides a comprehensive list of metabolites in a single biofluid. Our study aims to discover new and validate previously identified metabolic signatures for whole-body irradiation in mice. The study comprised 33 C57BL6 male (8-10 weeks) mice, distributed as 5Gy, 7.5Gy, and controls, with 11 each, and irradiated through a 60Co gamma source. Urine samples collected post-24 hours were run in both ESI positive and negative modes.

All data were normalized by sum and pareto-scaled, followed by multivariate analysis, including PCA and PLS-DA. Univariate analysis (t-test, p<0.05) revealed significant molecules, including creatinine, L-carnitine, betaine, 8-hydroxyquinone, taurine, and quinolinic acid. This study validates our previously reported significant metabolites, such as citric acid, hippuric acid, and taurine, laying the foundation for high-throughput triaging by metabolomic biomarkers for effective medical management. Pathway analysis also provided additional insights.

### P-541: ASICS: Identification and Quantification of Metabolites in Complex 1D 1H NMR Spectra
**Presenting Author:** Gaëlle Lefort, INRA, France  
**Co-Authors:** Laurence Liaubet, Hélène Quesnel, Cécile Canlet, Nathalie Vialaneix, Rémi Servien

**Abstract:**
1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a high-throughput technology that allows obtaining metabolomic profiles from easy-to-obtain fluids, such as blood, at moderate cost. However, interpreting NMR spectra can be challenging, as metabolites are often identified and quantified only from expert knowledge.

To facilitate the use of such data, we developed ASICS, an R package that implements a method for the automatic identification and quantification of metabolites in 1H NMR spectra. The package combines all steps of the analysis, including managing a reference library with pure metabolite spectra, preprocessing, quantification, diagnosis tools to assess the quality of quantification, and post-quantification statistical analyses.

Recent developments improve alignment algorithms and quantification using information from all spectra in the same study. We evaluated ASICS using data from PORCINET (ANR-09-GENM-005), assessing both quantification and its impact on post-quantification differential analysis. Correlations between ASICS relative quantifications and biochemical dosages of three metabolites were computed and compared with other quantification methods like Autofit and batman. These comparisons showed that ASICS allows for faster and simpler direct biological interpretation and more precise identification and quantification of metabolites than other methods. ASICS is released as an R/Bioconductor package.

### P-542: High Accuracy of Retention Time Prediction for Plant Food Bioactives Using PredRet
**Presenting Author:** Claudine Manach, INRA, France  
**Co-Authors:** Low D, Micheau P, Abranko L., Bronze M., Hanhineva K., Koistinen V., Stanstrup J, Manach C

**Abstract:**
Plant food bioactives receive widespread interest for their protective health effects. However, their identification in untargeted metabolomics profiles of food or biofluids remains challenging due to their chemical diversity and the lack of chemical standards for many of their phase I, II, and microbial metabolites. Retention time (RT) is valuable for assisting identification by narrowing the number of hypotheses within an observed RT window.

In the framework of the COST Action FA1403 POSITIVe, we evaluated the usefulness of PredRet, an open-access RT database, to predict RT of plant food bioactive metabolites in a multi-laboratory test involving 18 laboratories and 24 reversed-phase chromatographic systems. Participants shared datasets of RT in their own systems for 29 to 104 compounds, covering a total of 471 chemicals, including aglycones, glycosides, conjugated, and microbial metabolites of flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, and others.

Depending on its comparability with other systems, every platform obtained predicted RTs for 67 to 667 compounds not analyzed in their conditions. The predictions were very accurate, with a median prediction error ranging from 0.03 to 0.76 minutes. Such accuracy allowed distinguishing isomeric compounds and provided information for rare standards. In conclusion, RT prediction with PredRet has proven very useful for facilitating the annotation of plant food bioactives in metabolomics studies.

### P-543: Metabolic Effects of Dietary Glycerol Supplementation in Muscle and Liver of European Seabass and Rainbow Trout by 1H NMR Metabolomics
**Presenting Author:** Mariana Palma, Universidade de Coimbra, Portugal  
**Co-Authors:** Ludgero C. Tavares, João Rito, Luís F. Henriques, Paulo Rema, Leonardo J. Magnoni, Ivan Viegas

**Abstract:**
The sustainable development of aquaculture depends on substituting fishmeal with alternative ingredients, especially for carnivorous fish like rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Glycerol has been used as an alternative energy source in diets for farmed animals, sparing amino acids for other functions such as growth.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of dietary glycerol supplementation on the muscle and liver metabolome of rainbow trout and European seabass. Fish were fed diets with 0%, 2.5%, and 5% glycerol, and muscle and liver samples were collected. 1H-Presat and CPMG spectra were acquired for each muscle and liver sample, respectively, on a Varian VNMRS 600 MHz spectrometer.

Both untargeted and targeted approaches were followed, applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and univariate statistical analysis. PCA plot scores showed scarce differences in muscle and liver metabolite composition in both species, regardless of the treatment. Univariate analysis revealed more variations in the muscle and liver metabolome of European seabass, generally related to protein biosynthesis pathways, while variations in rainbow trout were associated with choline-related metabolism.

Rainbow trout seems more suitable for feeding with these dietary glycerol percentages, and the tested diets have the potential to be used in aquaculture production. The NMR-metabolomics approach proved adequate for providing a quick global overview of the results and enabling general tissue metabolite profiling.

### P-544: Accelerating Substructure Annotations in Complex Metabolite Mixtures
**Presenting Author:** Justin J.J. van der Hooft, Bioinformatics Group, Dept of Plant Sciences, Wageningen University, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Madeleine Ernst, Sam Stokman, Cher Wei Ong, Lars Ridder, Stefan Verhoeven, Ricardo da Silva, Mingxun Wang, Kyo Bin Kang, Joe Wandy, Pieter C. Dorrestein, Marnix H. Medema, Simon Rogers

**Abstract:**
Deciphering complex metabolite mixtures remains a challenging task due to the complexity and sheer number of information-rich mass fragmentation spectra. However, we take advantage of this information-richness by using computational approaches that discover spectral similarities and mass spectral patterns corresponding to the biochemical building blocks of molecules, termed substructures.

We highlight recent advances that integrate existing metabolome mining tools with annotation tools such as Network Annotation Propagation and tools that specifically annotate possible peptidic spectra. This eases the interpretation of large mass spectral molecular networks. For example, we used the ClassyFire chemical classification ontology to annotate molecular families (MFs) observed in large MS/MS data collections, helping to prioritize relevant MFs. In bacterial data, we quickly assessed the presence of peptidic MFs and discovered new structural variants of the cyclic peptide Xenoamicin.
