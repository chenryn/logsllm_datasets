ABSTRACT
With the widespread use of smart devices, device authentication has
received much attention. One popular method for device authen-
tication is to utilize internally-measured device fingerprints, such
as device ID, software or hardware-based characteristics. In this
paper, we propose DeMiCPU, a stimulation-response-based device
fingerprinting technique that relies on externally-measured infor-
mation, i.e., magnetic induction (MI) signals emitted from the CPU
module that consists of the CPU chip and its affiliated power supply
circuits. The key insight of DeMiCPU is that hardware discrepancies
essentially exist among CPU modules and thus the corresponding
MI signals make promising device fingerprints, which are difficult
to be modified or mimicked. We design a stimulation and a discrep-
ancy extraction scheme and evaluate them with 90 mobile devices,
including 70 laptops (among which 30 are of totally identical CPU
and operating system) and 20 smartphones. The results show that
DeMiCPU can achieve 99.1% precision and recall on average, and
98.6% precision and recall for the 30 identical devices, with a finger-
printing time of 0.6 s. In addition, the performance can be further
improved to 99.9% with multi-round fingerprinting.

1 INTRODUCTION
Mobile devices have emerged as the most popular platforms to
assist daily activities and exchange information over the Internet.
According to Gartner [16], there are more than 11 billion phones,
tablets and laptops by the end of 2018. Along with the rapid growth
is the rising demand of device authentication: it is useful for applica-
tions to recognize whether they are executing on the same device
as the previously registered one, e.g., during payments, to ensure
the safety of personal privacy or cyber assets.
One of the strategies for device authentication is device finger-
printing. Existing device fingerprinting solutions are mainly based
on internal device information (e.g., IMEI (device ID), serial num-
bers of laptops), or built out of software or hardware characteristics.
Software-based fingerprints utilize wireless traffic patterns [33],
browser properties [46], and etc., while hardware-based finger-
prints utilize hardware characteristics such as clock skews [26, 34],
accelerometers [13], gyroscopes [2], microphones [11], cameras [14,
29], and Bluetooth implementation [1].
In this paper, we propose to fingerprint devices exploiting the fea-
tured electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals radiated by CPU
modules on devices, which we call CPU fingerprints. The advantage
of such a CPU fingerprint is that it can be measured externally
rather than internally by the operating system (OS), which could be
a useful feature for applications on external devices to authenticate
the devices. In addition, a CPU module is indispensable for almost
all mobile or smart devices, and thus the CPU fingerprint is likely
to be more universal compared with aforementioned built-in sensor
based approaches.
Based on it, we design DeMiCPU, a device fingerprinting scheme
consisting of a trusted DeMiCPU server, a stimulation program on the
target device, and a trusted stand-alone DeMiCPU capturing module
with a built-in magnetic sensor (in short DeMiCPU sensor), as shown
in Fig. 1, and it works as follows. Once an application requests for
device fingerprinting, DeMiCPU starts the stimulation program, and
the DeMiCPU sensor measures and packages the measurements with
protection and uploads the packaged measurements to the DeMiCPU
server for fingerprint matching. An attacker may try to impersonate
a target device by emulating the EMI radiated by its CPU module,
but it is almost impossible to produce an EMI pattern close enough
to that of the target device, as analyzed in Sec. 7.
DeMiCPU is promising yet challenging. First, EMI spans a wide
spectrum, including high frequency that may produce data at the
rate of Gbps. Such computation and communication costs are unac-
ceptable, especially for the DeMiCPU sensor. Second, all electronic
components inside a device emit EMI and their operation status
affects the level of EMI. It is difficult, if ever possible, to control
the status of each component across various attempts of measure-
ment. Besides, it is unclear whether the EMI radiated from the same
device at various time instants or locations is consistent and the
ones from different devices are distinct. Last but not least, the EMI
radiation may contain a large amount of noise and how to extract
fingerprints efficiently out of the noisy EMI radiation is nontrivial.
This paper addresses aforementioned challenges and validates the
feasibility of CPU fingerprint.
Which frequency to measure and how to measure? After careful
analysis and experimental validation, we choose low-frequency
magnetic induction (MI) signals ( two wavelengths) and magnetic induction
(MI) in the near field (< a wavelength). Since EMR is the main
cause that affects interoperability of devices, it is suppressed for
electromagnetic compatibility [18]. Yet MI signals dominate the near
field and do not propagate as far as EMR. Being less a concern of
interference, MI signals are not intentionally suppressed and serve
as an excellent candidate for extracting hardware fingerprints.
How to induce consistent MI? It is almost impossible to control
the status of each component, and thus we focus on controlling
the one that emits the majority of MI signals, i.e., the CPU mod-
ule that consists of the CPU chip and its affiliated power supply
circuits. In this way, MI signals contributed by other components
on the motherboard can be neglected. CPU fingerprints are made
possible because even for devices of the same model, CPU mod-
ules are discrepant due to hardware diversities introduced during
the manufacturing process. However, various applications may
lead to various MI signals of the CPU module (as our experiments
confirmed). To ensure that the CPU load and operation status are
similar across measurements, we analyze the cause and influencing
factors of the emitted MI signals and design a set of instructions

duce strong MI signals when large currents flow through it.
to generate an identical 100% utilization stimulation to the CPU
module.
How to extract fingerprints despite of noise? To distinguish the
subtle discrepancies of CPU modules when the measurement of MI
signals could be noisy, we remove the effects of the geomagnetic
field and environmental noise in the pre-processing phase before
extracting a set of 15 carefully-selected features, which serves as the
fingerprint of the device. To further ensure high accuracy, reliability
and usability in DeMiCPU, we compare 10 common classifiers to
elect the appropriate classification algorithm. In summary, our
contribution includes the following:
• We propose to fingerprint mobile devices by monitoring
the MI signals emitted from the CPU module. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work to attempt device
fingerprinting based on the fingerprints of CPU modules.
• We design an efficient MI-based fingerprinting scheme con-
sisting of identical stimulation generation, effective feature
extraction and valid fingerprint matching, which can identify
devices reliably and accurately.
• We validate DeMiCPU on 90 mobile devices, including 70 lap-
tops and 20 smartphones. The results show that DeMiCPU
can achieve 99.1% precision and recall on average, and 98.6%
precision and recall for 30 identical devices, with a finger-
printing time of 0.6 s. Both precision and recall can be further
improved to 99.9% with multi-round fingerprinting.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Magnetic Induction of Electronic Devices
All electronic components emit electromagnetic interference (EMI)
when currents flow. EMI emitted from electronic components (e.g.,
CPUs, fans, GPUs) includes two types: high-frequency electromag-
netic radiation (EMR) signals and low-frequency magnetic induc-
tion (MI) signals. EMR refers to electromagnetic waves that are
synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields and propa-
gate at the speed of light. High-frequency EMR waves are mainly
at an order of MHz or above, and are always effectively reduced
or shielded [18] to eliminate interference with other electronic
components or devices. By contrast, MI signals are non-radiative
waves generated by currents and are typically not intentionally
suppressed. In addition, MI signals have a relatively larger strength
and a lower frequency than EMR, and thus can be measured by
low-frequency magnetic sensors. Therefore, MI signals are good
representatives of EMI emitted from a device.
2.2 The CPU Module
The CPU module of a device refers to the CPU chip and its affili-
ated DC/DC converter. The computation-intensive nature of the
CPU chip draws heavy currents from the DC/DC converter, which
generate strong MI signals.
CPU. A CPU chip consists of hundreds of millions of CMOS
(complementary metal oxide semiconductor) transistors arranged
in a lattice form, which performs basic arithmetic, logical, control
and input/output (I/O) operations. The CPU current depends on
the power consumption of the CMOS circuits, which has three
components: static power dissipation, short-circuit power dissipa-
tion, and dynamic power dissipation, mathematically denoted as
follows [38]:
Pcmos = Pst at ic + Pshor t −cir cuit + Pdynamic
(1)
Pst at ic , a.k.a., leakage power dissipation, is a steady and constant
energy cost caused by the leakage currents of transistors. Pshor t −cir cuit
arises when two transistors in a CMOS gate are on at the same time,
which creates a short circuit from the voltage supply to the ground
and thus consumes energy. Pdynamic is caused by the switching of
CMOS gates. Energy consumption of a CPU mainly depends on the
dynamic power dissipation of the CMOS lattice, which is roughly
equal to the energy change in the output capacitance of CMOS
transistors. Average power consumption of a multi-core CPU can
be modeled as follows [39]:

where N is the number of CPU cores. Ci , A, V and F are influencing
factors, with their meanings summarized in Tab. 1. V and F are
further related to the CPU load α due to the power-management
technique DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) [28] ap-
plied by modern devices. DVFS decreases the clock frequency and
allows a corresponding reduction in the supply voltage for energy
saving. For example, for a ThinkPad T440p laptop, V and F are
0.899 V and 3095.95 MHz when the CPU load is 100%, and they
drop to 0.668 V and 798.95 MHz when the CPU becomes idle (2−3%
load on average). As all the four factors are hardware related and
CMOS circuits are various across CPUs, those factors are distinct
from device to device (detailed in Sec. 2.3).
In this section, we begin with the principle of magnetic signals,
then elaborate how CPU modules can produce magnetic signals,
and finally explain why magnetic signals from CPU modules are
differentiated in nature.
DC/DC converter. Due to the difference of voltage levels be-
tween the CPU and the power supply system (either a battery or an
external power source), a DC/DC converter is placed close to the
CPU chip to convert a high voltage to a low one [10]. In Fig. 2, we
show the key components of a DC/DC converter and its relation-
ship with the CPU chip. In principle, the high-frequency switch

in the DC/DC converter works in a duty-cycle mode to generate a
lower voltage. Electronic components including the capacitors, in-
ductors, and diodes are utilized to make the output voltage smooth
and continuous. The regulated voltage and currents are then fed
into the CPU chip to satisfy its computation requirements.
In short, CPU chips nowadays exploit a reduced voltage for en-
ergy efficiency, but incur heavy currents when performing computation-
intensive tasks. The heavy currents flowing through the CPU mod-
ule generate strong MI signals, which are further amplified by the
inductor inside the DC/DC converter, due to the effect of coils.
2.3 CPU Module Discrepancy
Hardware discrepancies exist among devices, or more precisely,
their CPU modules. For CPUs of various models, all the four fac-
tors Ci , V , A and F that affect the CPU power consumption, can
be different due to the discrepancies in hardware structure and
specification. Even for CPUs of the same model, e.g., Intel Core
i5-3210M for ThinkPad T440p laptops, discrepancies exist due to
the imperfections introduced during the manufacturing process.
As shown in Tab. 1, manufacture techniques have influence upon
three factors Ci , V , and F , i.e., the transistor sizes, working voltages,
and working frequencies of CPU chips can be distinct. Besides,
the DC/DC converter of the CPU module further enlarges the dif-
ferences. Therefore, MI signals from CPU modules of the same
or various models are distinct due to the hardware discrepancies
across devices.
In summary, MI signals from CPU modules are different in nature
and can serve as a candidate of device fingerprints. In addition, CPU
load α affects MI signals since it influences V and F . As a result, MI
signals can be strengthened by increasing the CPU load. Thus, to
maintain a stable observation of MI signals, the CPU load shall be
accurately controlled.

3 PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
In this section, we verify the feasibility of CPU fingerprints em-
pirically. As shown in Fig. 10, we collect MI signals emitted from
the CPU models with a magnetic-field sensor DRV425 [22] from
Texas Instruments (TI), and conduct AD conversion with a data
acquisition (DAQ) card U2541A [25] from Keysight at a sampling
rate of 200 kHz. Each collection lasts for 1 s (0.5 s is shown to be
sufficient to fingerprint a device in Sec. 6).
