User: Does anybody know, how GAE limit Python interpreter? For example, how they block IO operations, or URL operations. 
Shared hosting also do it in some way?
Assistant: The sandbox "internally works" by them having a special version of the Python interpreter. You aren't running the standard Python executable, but one especially modified to run on Google App engine.
Update: 
And no it's not a virtual machine in the ordinary sense. Each application does not have a complete virtual PC. There may be some virtualization going on, but Google isn't saying exactly how much or what.
A process has normally in an operating system already limited access to the rest of the OS and the hardware. Google have limited this even more and you get an environment where you are only allowed to read the very specific parts of the file system, and not write to it at all, you are not allowed to open sockets and not allowed to make system calls etc.
I don't know at which level OS/Filesystem/Interpreter each limitation is implemented, though.
