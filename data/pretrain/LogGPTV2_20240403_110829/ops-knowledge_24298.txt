User:  How to copy folders and subfolders on Linux with a single command?
Assistant: The most common way to copy folders and subfolders on Linux is with the cp command. To copy an entire folder and all its subfolders and files, you can use the following command: cp -r source folder target folder where, -r option means recursive copy, will copy all subdirectories and files under the source folder, Includes hidden files and directories. For example, to copy a folder named "source" and all its subfolders and files to a folder named "destination", enter the following command: cp -r source destination Note that if the destination folder exists, then All copied files and subfolders will be added to the destination folder. If you want them to overwrite the existing destination folder, you can add the -f flag: cp -rf source destination This will force overwrite the existing destination folder. Use this option with caution to avoid unnecessary data loss.
