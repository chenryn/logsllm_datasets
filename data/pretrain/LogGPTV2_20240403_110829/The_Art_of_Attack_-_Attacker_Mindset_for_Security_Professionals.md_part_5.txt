ing you from thinking clearly. Lean into it and let it pass. You will
become better and better, faster and faster at it.
Emergency Conditioning
Another component of OAMs is the ability to visualize, create, and
construct scenarios based on information, which should serve to
keep things straight in your mind. There’s a game of mental chess
to be played before each attack, as I’ve mentioned frequently. How-
ever, you cannot assume that you will conjure up the exact scenar-
ios you will walk into, because there’s no conceivable way to picture
every act, action, and reaction that may occur. This ability to visual-
ize is not shorthand for “manifestation.” It’s simply a good offen-
sive warm -up strategy that can get the offensive juices flowing, so
to speak. It’s a skill you can build up now that will help your future
self— and it makes thinking critically in the moment easier.
The brain is the strongest force in the body. It can overcome
many adverse things, especially if you practice mental preparation.
This practice can allow you to far exceed your physical and even
mental limitations, but you have to train your brain for it. This sort
of training relies on two things that you will need to do and use:
Offensive vs. Defensive Attacker Mindset 27
first, be prepared to use the fourth law of AMs; make every move
count in the direction of the objective.
Second, you must also be able to employ situational awareness,
which is essentially knowing what is going on around you. That’s a
broad definition, but there are items that you should look at. Above
all else, start with entry control and access. There are two ways you
must pay attention to these things: you must know how you are
entering and how you can exit. This is true of network pen tests
when exfiltrating information and covering your tracks, to vish-
ing tests where starting and ending the call naturally enough so as
to not invoke a negative feeling from the target is often essential.
You never want to raise suspicions. You must also try to gauge how
porous the establishment is overall. Both may include looking at
doors, gates, fences, walls, windows, skylights, even sewage pipes.
Look for how easily vendors gain access, where they park, and so
forth. You should look for wall and ceiling cameras and even body
cameras. You should try to be aware of motion sensors and other
barriers. In a sense, attacker mindset and attacking is part of the
built environment; the design of any structure always implies a way
to exploit it.
Just as architecture and crime intersect, so, too, does efficient
crime intersect with cities and even neighborhoods. You should
also consider both of these. For example, if you were to think like
an attacker breaking into a bank in Los Angeles, you might con-
sider how far you are from one of the Freeways, the main links con-
necting downtown and the suburbs, which spread throughout the
region in a vast network of concrete ribbons. You would study where
exactly you were headed after the heist and not time the operation
for rush hour. As an ethical attacker you might not need to think of
these things as you have tangible confirmation that you are there
to test security, typically in the form of a letter from someone high
up within the organization, but because a real attacker does not,
they will think about the broader logistics. You might also consider
that Los Angeles, a sprawling county composed of a series of widely
dispersed settlements, is heavily policed from the air—more so than
any other US city, and that getting away without law enforcement
28 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
being informed is of the utmost importance to your get-a way being
a success. But Manhattan, NY, on the other hand, is not anything
like this. Its long, skyscraper- lined streets make policing from the
air more cumbersome. It would also be notable to an attacker that
Manhattan is surrounded by water, making alternative methods of
escape plausible. Not to mention the elaborate, comprehensive sub-
way system—another area hard to police effectively. However, the
streets of New York lend themselves to police cars chasing suspects
pretty well, and the plethora of alleyways that result in dead ends
can make escape hard should the authorities or security be alerted
of your operation.
In a network pen test, gathering as much information as pos-
sible for the compromised environments and the domain network
means having situational awareness. Pre- entry, reconnaissance on
infrastructure can tell you quite a lot about the target’s network, too.
Tools like NsLookup (www.nslookup.io)— a command- line tool for
querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain a domain name
or IP address, or other DNS records—a nd theHarvester (https://
github.com/laramies/theHarvester)— used to gather information
of emails, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports, and
banners— can give you a lot of information to start building your
attack and increasing your awareness of the target’s environment.
Including situational awareness in assessing whether your next
step is for the good of the objective or not is non-n egotiable. You
cannot blindly attempt to obtain the objective; you must use the
information you know and the information around you, reevaluat-
ing the further you get into the target’s territory. Of course, this is
true for actual events, but if you are practicing emergency condi-
tioning in your mind you will have to imagine variations of what
is included when assessing your surroundings. Which leads me to
this: when practicing emergency conditioning, the purpose is to not
get fixated on any one move or outcome.
The best analogy I have for it is this: if you have to picture your-
self crossing a busy road, envision getting hit by a vehicle. . .a fun
task. You have no way to know the color, make, model, year, or speed
of the car, you won’t know if it has a dashboard camera attached,
Offensive vs. Defensive Attacker Mindset 29
and you won’t know the direction it will hit you from, but you can
imagine being hit by it at all speeds, what you’d do depending on
the speed, where you get hit, and so forth. And then you can try
to imagine dodging that car from different angles depending on its
angle of approach. You can imagine it all a hundred ways or more,
and you should always imagine surviving.
By imagining it, you will think of the sounds a car driving at
a high speed makes, the difference in volume as it skids around a
corner, and so forth. By doing this over and over, slightly differently
every time, you might be better prepared when the time to cross the
road actually comes. You would likely be quicker to dodge a car,
even if in our imaginings it was yellow, and in actuality, it was a
truck. I know, that was very uplifting.
This type of mental exercise is akin to emergency conditioning,
which is just a training technique used to make unknown situa-
tions seem familiar. You are basically tricking your brain into being
familiar with an experience so that when it, or something similar,
actually unfolds in the real world, it doesn’t seem as intimidating or
daunting and your reaction rate will go up.
Notably, there is an upside to experiencing moderate levels of
stress— even if you are just imagining the stress. Stress is often
viewed as an absolute negative. It occurs when someone feels an
imbalance between a challenge and the resources they have to deal
with it. But it turns out that there are different kinds of stress and
that, in smaller quantities, it can be very helpful. Eustress (benefi-
cial stress) is a common form of stress. It’s the sort of stress you feel
before performing, and as EAs our job is to perform, in the sense of
both execution and acting.
The factors that lead to eustress result in short-l ived changes in
hormone levels in the body. Normally, this type of stress does not
last long and will not have long-t erm negative health effects. These
smaller levels of stress can enhance our motivation. Small doses of
stress can also force people to problem solve, ultimately building
the skill and their own confidence in it. However, the relationship
between the brain’s health and stress is a very selective one, and
there’s no universal preferred amount of stress, because each of our
30 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
brains is different. Most importantly, this effect is only seen when
stress is intermittent. When stress continues for a prolonged period
of time, there is a buildup of cortisol in the brain that can have
long- term effects. Thus, chronic stress can lead to many health trou-
bles. When chronic stress is experienced, our bodies produce more
cortisol than it can release, and high levels of cortisol can wear down
the brain’s capacity to function properly. Several studies indicate
that chronic stress impairs brain function by disrupting synapse
regulation— resulting in the loss of sociability and the avoidance
of interactions with others—b y killing brain cells and even reduc-
ing the size of the brain. The prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain
responsible for memory and learning, undergoes a shrinking effect
when high levels of cortisol are present due to chronic stress. It can
also increase the size of the amygdala, which can make the brain
even more receptive to stress. A vicious cycle that has no upside.
The following graphic shows where optimal performance lies
in conjunction with optimal stress and what can occur as a result.
However, as noted previously, there’s no universal preferred amount
of stress. You will have to figure how much stress has the Goldilocks
effect for you.

Finally, confidence in OAMs’ skills allows you as an attacker
to stay on the offensive in live attacks, to be in a state of readiness.
The bottom line of OAMs comes down to being able to analyze an
organization, identify the security gaps and exploit them effectively,
knowing the risks and acting anyway. You are the storm that forces
change in critical infrastructure and environment.
Defensive Attacker Mindset
Defensive skills help attackers succeed consistently and in all condi-
tions. Defensive skills include the capacity to adapt and respond to
surges in security or target resistance. The key words that describe
defensive mental skills are balance, resilience, and caution.
When your defensive skills are strong, you become a consistent
performer, finding success in the smaller components as well as the
overall attacks far more often. Whereas with OAMs the ability to
apply change is a coveted skill, with DAMs the kernel of success is
the ability to adapt to change. With DAMs, adapting with resiliency
is critical.
Consistency and Regulation
There’s another link between OAMs and DAMs we need to explore:
offensive mental skills are necessary for excellence, but as attackers
we need defensive skills to maintain excellence. OAMs’ penchant
for stealth and competition— and the drive that comes with it—
will be complemented by your defensive skills, allowing you as an
attacker to be resilient and consistent in any conditions. This shows
up when you pivot in a bid to win— your OAMs pushes this while
your DAMs regulates it, making you consider the risks, even if fleet-
ingly, and thus ensuring endurance. It also allows much of your
agility to be executed carefully, because OAMs is primarily con-
cerned with winning and will use persistence as a force, sometimes
to the engagement’s detriment. DAMs will take that power and cool
it, keeping you stable.
32 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
Another way in which DAMs strikes a healthy balance with
OAMs is in organization. Whereas OAMs demands that you pivot
and apply new information for the good of the objective, DAMs
allows for a standard to be adhered to. You must always apply infor-
mation in an organized, efficient, and useful manner. You cannot
blindly try things without surveying the environment for defenses
that would thwart your plan.
Anxiety Control
One of the most important facets of DAMs is its capacity to help
control anxiety. This becomes more critical, more vital, and even
more indispensable as the critical stage of the attack approaches—
this is recognizable as the point at which the significance of the
operation typically increases. If you fail at that point, the operation
is over. There is no room for error and no second chance.
At this point, there is less room for flexibility with options and
opportunity typically becoming scarcer, too. I like to think of this as
a funnel effect; the further you get into an attack and the closer you
get to reaching your objective, the fewer options and less freedom
you have. There may be only a few moves that would allow you to
achieve your desired outcome. Anxiety- inducing stuff.
Here’s an example: When approaching a building, you may have
the choice of 10 entry and exit points to try. Once inside, you may
have three or four routes to the security operations center (SOC),
for example. Getting into the SOC may come down to two poten-
tial moves: up through the tiled roof and down the other side or
through the door should you able to get it open. There’s the bonus
“option” of randomicity, which may show up as someone walking
out of the SOC’s security doors, allowing you to walk effortlessly
in, but you typically wouldn’t count on this. As the funnel effect
unfolds, it’s easy for anxiety to build.
When the body perceives a stress, it goes into “fight or flight”
mode. Our attention gets highly focused and a slew of other bodily
changes take place. This innate response is what allows parents to
Offensive vs. Defensive Attacker Mindset 33
flip cars off their children and injured soldiers to continue fighting.
Alas, there is a limit to how beneficial stress is. Too much stress
causes performance to suffer. You may also take time to identify the
root cause of your nervousness.
Clammy hands. Dry mouth. Shortness of breath. Shaky. Tense
body parts. Sound familiar? Nerves. They get too many of us too
often. As I’ve already confessed, I break out in a weird, patchy rash
when I am really nervous. The old-a ge method of picturing your
team or target in their underwear is by far the worst idea you’ll have
on the job, and thankfully you might not need to. Employing your
DAMs means you should be able to quash, or at the very least quiet,
those nerves before they’ve taken root. Identifying the root cause of
your nerves will help you conceptualize them, which means that
you can apply reason to them. This is important for multiple rea-
sons, not the least of which is stamping out that anxiety and enjoy-
ing critical thought processes again. The first step is to interrupt
that feedback loop.
Anxiety often begins in the amygdalae, which is where your
brain processes memory and interprets emotions. It’s now under-
stood that you can reduce anxiety signals from your amygdalae if
you assign names or labels to the emotions that you’re experiencing
at the time.
Another effective way to bring back critical thought processes
is a breathing technique practiced by the Navy SEALs called tacti-
cal breathing. It focuses on slowing your rate of breathing down by
pushing the breath through the nostrils, counting to four for each
inhale and exhale. This technique might seem simple, but it has a
huge impact.
Now, I’d like to note that your DAMs will have to work in con-
cert with your OAMs at many times. For instance, if the root reason
for nerves is fear of loss of control, you will have to employ func-
tions from the OAMs “comfort with risk” structure. Sometimes all
your DAMs can do is help you identify the origins, which is still a
huge help that shouldn’t be overlooked. In other cases, DAMs is
enough; if the root cause of your nerves is that you feel you don’t
34 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
have enough information, you’ve underprepared. DAMs will help
you ensure this never happens—i f you employ it by ensuring you
prepare and consider the defenses you will go up against.
Remember, the defensive side of the AMs is what helps a great
attacker win consistently and in all conditions. Defensive skills
include the capacity to adapt and respond. Through DAMs you
know there are many uncontrolled variables, and it’s easy to get
overwhelmed. Simply knowing this is enough to begin turning the
tide. DAMs can give you a high level of understanding and allows
you to control anxiety, because defensively you know neither stress
nor anxiety will aid your performance and that OAMs has you cov-
ered on the opposing side.
Instill in yourself the point of any defensive strategy—t o fend
off and block what doesn’t serve you or that wants to harm you. Pre-
pare and remember your goal, adapt to the situation, and respond
with confidence in knowing the attack will never overtake you. You
are performing it. DAMs is a regulator; it keeps you calm and allows
for a modest amount of caution. Whereby OAMs allows you growth
in stressful moments, DAMs regulates the stress you feel so that you
actually use it as a driving force, recognizing it as a reason to adapt
to, and then apply, your own changes.
Recovery, Distraction, and Maintenance
The skill of quickly recovering from setbacks is a defensive men-
tal skill that pays dividends in lengthy engagements. This, coupled
with the ability to focus despite distractions, is a potent combina-
tion completely in your favor as an attacker. This is critical at times
where distractions increase in proportion to the size and importance
of the job. It also helps prevent false positive opportunity identi-
fication. Not every incident or event is an opportunity for you as
an attacker— sometimes it’s just good enough to be able to observe
them, with no need to act.
Finally, mental maintenance skills, or the ability to maintain
simple, effective thoughts under pressure, is often the difference
