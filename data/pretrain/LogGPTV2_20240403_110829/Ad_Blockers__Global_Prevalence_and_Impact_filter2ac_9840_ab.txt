While there are many variations, the basic problem setup
can be captured as follows. Let 1, . . . , k denote the classes,
and let P1, . . . , Pk be known, estimated, or otherwise re-
stricted class conditional probability distributions over a fea-
ture space. Given unlabeled data with a probability distribu-
tion P , and the estimates of the class conditional distribu-
tions, ﬁnd the relative proportion of each class in the unla-
beled data. In short, given P1, . . . , Pk, and P , ﬁnd propor-
tions π1, . . . , πk, such that
P =
πi Pi.

MPE is a powerful approach as it circumvents the need
for data classiﬁcation. The proportions of the classes are
inferred from the data in aggregate, permitting success even
when classiﬁcation error rates are prohibitively high. In con-
trast, a manifest and domineering approach to this problem
is to ﬁrst classify each data point, and then ﬁnd the propor-
tions of each class directly from the inferred classiﬁcation.
This approach is inherently limited by the error rates of the
k(cid:88)
classiﬁer; in the noisy, feature limited setting studied here,
where classiﬁcation would be based on the ad ratio statistic
alone, this approach can fail entirely.
tio statistic for cookies known to have one or more ad
blockers installed
In the context of estimation of ad blocking deployment,
the MPE approach relies on the distribution of the ad ra-
tio statistic associated with the three populations of cookies:
Sads, Sblock and S, corresponding to labeled cookies with-
out ad blocking software, labeled cookies with ad blocking
software, and unlabeled cookies. These populations deﬁne
three histograms over the ad ratio statistic:
1. (cid:98)Pads ∈ Rm – normalized histogram over the ad ra-
2. (cid:98)Pblock ∈ Rm – normalized histogram over the ad ratio
3. (cid:98)P ∈ Rm – normalized histogram of unlabeled com-
tains approximately the same number of cookies for (cid:98)P , i.e.,
(cid:3).
the boundaries of the bins are such that (cid:98)P ≈

blockers,

Score cookies from the comScore census network.
With the three histograms as input, a single variable opti-
mization is run to ﬁnd the mixture proportion such that the
labeled histograms best align with the unlabeled histogram
according to (2). The procedure is detailed in Algorithm 1.

The algorithm returns the estimate of the proportion of
ad block users, denoted π∗. We refer to this value as the
MPE percent adblock. As equality in (2) is rarely if ever
satisﬁed for any mixture proportion, the mixture proportion
that results in the minimum objective function, f (·), between
the histograms is returned by the optimization.

where n is the number of samples in histogram Q.
Validation via Signiﬁcance Testing. The underlying hy-
pothesis of MPE is that unlabeled data are well represented
by a combination of the labeled datasets according to (2).
After the optimization is run, this hypothesis can be con-
ﬁrmed or rejected by asking, in the context of goodness of
ﬁt (GoF) testing, how well does the best mixture distribution,
π∗ (cid:98)Pblock +(1−π∗)(cid:98)Pads, match the data, (cid:98)P ? If the results of
the GoF test indicate that the histograms aren’t well matched
the original hypothesis is rejected, and the estimated propor-
tions are invalid.
The canonical GoF test for categorical data is Pearson’s
Chi-squared test [1]. In general, the Chi-squared test takes
the χ2 statistic and the number of samples associated with
the histogram under test as input, and outputs a p-value.
Note that in our setting, a high p-value is good, as it indi-
cates the data is well represented by the mixture distribution.
As both histograms are empirical, we consider the larger
dataset, (cid:98)P , to represent the theoretical frequencies, which
is a standard approach in GoF testing. When the χ2 statis-
tic is used as the objective, the GoF test is baked into the
optimization and MPE approach is equivalent to ﬁnding the
mixture proportions that result in the maximum p-value (i.e.,
the least statistically signiﬁcant outcome, the outcome that
best matches the data). We use Chi-squared tests to conﬁrm
the validity of the MPE approach on the various datasets.
4. RESULTS
This section presents estimates on the prevalence and im-
pact of ad blockers in the internet. More precisely, our MPE
approach was used to generate ad block percentages for key
geographies as shown in Table 1. From these percentages,
the MPE projection factor for each of the key geographies
was determined by dividing the MPE percent ad block, with
the χ2 objective, by the panel percent ad block. The MPE
approach can be applied to any arbitrary “breakout" (subset
of the overall population) by multiplying the projection fac-
tors by panel results for a target breakout. Due to space con-
siderations, we limit our analysis to several key breakouts in-
cluding (i) geographic, (ii) demographic, and (iii) publisher,
which highlights the impact of ad blockers in terms of po-
tential revenue loss.
To motivate and validate our MPE-based approach for this
problem we provide a visual representation for the underly-
ing distributions for ˆP , ˆPads, and ˆPblock for the US in Fig-
ure 1. Alongside these three histograms (e.g., the bottom
right histogram), we provide the histogram generated by us-
ing the α value that minimized the objective function in our
MPE algorithm. Visually, the success of the method is dic-
tated by how closely the histogram generated by the mix-
ture of ˆPads and ˆPblock matches the histogram of ˆP . Figure 1
shows that the two histograms match quite closely.
4.1 Geographic Breakout
Our geographic analysis of ad blocker prevalence consid-
ers the US, the UK, Germany, France, and Canada. These
countries were selected because they are all large digital ad-
vertising markets. Table 1 shows results of the MPE ap-
proach using L1, L2, and the χ2 statistic as the objective

ciated with the three populations of cookies from Section 3: ˆPblock,
ˆPads, and ˆP . The bottom right histogram is the mixture combination
of ˆPads and ˆPblock utilizing the MPE approach. Visually, the success
of the method is dictated by how closely the histogram generated
by the mixture of ˆPads and ˆPblock matches the histogram of ˆP .

functions. Ad block penetration in the US is 18% and varies
between 16% and 37% for other countries.
Within the US, we consider ad blocker installations on
state by state basis. Figure 2 quantiﬁes the ad block pene-
tration rates in a heat map. We ﬁnd that ad blocker penetra-
tion is greatest in Vermont (23.6%) and lowest in Mississippi
(9.9%).
4.2 Demographic Breakout
Figure 3 provides ad blocker penetration rates for key de-
mographic categories in Germany, the UK, and the US. Ad
blocker penetration is most prevalent among males 18-34.
This ﬁnding is consistent across all geographic areas with
Germany at 49%, the US at 29%, and the UK at 29%. The
18-34 age group is also consistently (across key geos) the
most prevalent ad blocker group among females with Ger-
many at 43%, the UK at 22%, and the US at 20%.

Results from using L1, L2, and χ2 statistical distance with p-value as the objective function are shown. A high p-value indicates success
of MPE as it implies the resulting mixture distribution is not statistically signiﬁcant with respect to the unlabeled data. The 95% conﬁdence
values indicate the range for which the corresponding mixture distribution has a p-value greater than 0.05. The underlying size n of each

4.3 Ad Block Market Share Analysis
As indicted in Section 2, there are a number of different ad
blockers available and in use today. A number of these report
their total installations. Thus, it is of interest to investigate
their relative market share, and our data and analytic method
allows us to estimate the prevalence of speciﬁc browsers/ad
blocker deployments. To quantify this, we focused on three
major browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and
Mozilla Firefox). Figure 4 is a heat map of the relative mar-
ket share of the top three ad block offerings (as well as a
catch all Other category) across three major browsers.
It
is clear from Figure 4 the market is dominated by Adblock
Plus for both Firefox (95.2% averaged across geos) and In-
ternet Explorer (93.8% averaged across geos). For Google
Chrome, the market share is distributed fairly evenly be-
tween Adblock Plus (49.7% averaged across geos) and Ad-
block (56.9% averaged across geos). Note, the values for
a particular geo/browser pair will not sum to 1 as a single
panelist may have more than one ad block offering installed.
4.4 Publisher Breakout
The analysis in subsections 4.1 and 4.2 on ad blocker pen-
etration across key geographies and key demographics high-
lights the difference in ad block use among different popu-
lation segments. For instance, ad blocker penetration skews
toward young males. These users inherently carry bias in the
sites they are likely to visit. Thus, the percentage of users
