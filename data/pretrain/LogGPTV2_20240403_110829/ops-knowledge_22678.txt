User: Is there any argument or options to setup a timeout for Python's subprocess.Popen method?
Something like this:
subprocess.Popen(['..'], ..., timeout=20) ?
Assistant: Unfortunately, there isn't such a solution. I managed to do this using a threaded timer that would launch along with the process that would kill it after the timeout but I did run into some stale file descriptor issues because of zombie processes or some such.
