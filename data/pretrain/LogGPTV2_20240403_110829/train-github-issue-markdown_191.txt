Hello,
I'm following the tf.profiler.Profiler guide to profile my code.  
When generating the timelines, all of them except the first one (for the first
batch) are scaled in hundreds of years, rather than seconds.
There is something happening at year 0, then something going on after 583
years.  
No, my DNN code is not that slow.

Running the latest stable version of everything.
Could you please recommend me a fix?  
Thank you
