individuals are less concerned about privacy [24, 33], oth-
ers reporting that high-income individuals are more likely to
engage in privacy-preserving behaviors [41], and still others
ﬁnding no signiﬁcant income effect [57].
Limiting our survey to parents also ignores the opin-
ions of other parties, including school and daycare teachers
and extended family members, who also purchase Internet-
connected toys for children but may have different privacy
norms. These individuals are also affected by COPPA and
have legitimate justiﬁcation for their opinions and interests
to be reﬂected in children’s privacy regulation. Likewise, we
did not ask whether our respondents were members of com-
munities that may have less common privacy norms, but our
respondent panel, drawn from across the United States, cer-
tainly missed smaller demographics.
Finally, our respondent panel consisted entirely of parents
living in the United States, as COPPA only applies to prod-
ucts sold in the U.S. These respondents are therefore inﬂu-
enced by American attitudes toward privacy, which may vary
from those of parents in other countries. We hope that future
work will apply the CI survey method used in this paper to
evaluate the alignment between privacy norms and privacy
regulation in non-U.S. contexts.
5.3 Goals of Privacy Regulation
Our use of CI surveys to evaluate privacy regulation as-
sumes that the underlying value of such regulation is to bet-
ter align data collection practices with privacy norms. This
makes an implicit normative argument about the purpose of
privacy regulation, which does not necessarily hold, espe-
cially for the norms of majority populations. For example,
privacy regulation may seek to protect minority or otherwise
vulnerable populations. In these cases, surveys of all individ-
uals affected by the regulation may reﬂect a majority view
that does not value the norms or appreciate the situation of
the target population. CI surveys could still be applied in
these contexts, but care would need to be taken to identify
and recruit respondents from populations differentially af-
fected by the regulation in order to uncover discrepancies
between the regulation and the norms of these groups.
Additionally, some regulation may be created with the
goal of changing existing norms. In these cases, the CI sur-
vey method will indicate that the regulation does not match
current privacy expectations upon enactment. However, CI
surveys would still be useful for conducting longitudinal
measurements to track whether the regulation has the desired
effect on privacy norms over time.
6 Discussion & Future Work
We would like this study to serve as a template for future
work using contextual integrity to analyze current or pending
privacy regulation for policy or systems design insights. This
section discusses our COPPA ﬁndings and presents sugges-
tions for future applications of our method by policymakers,
device manufacturers, and researchers.

6.1 COPPA Insights & Concerns
Previous research indicates that parents actively manage
the information about their children on social media plat-
forms to avoid oversharing [2], and that owners of IoT home
appliances view most data collection by these devices as in-
herently unacceptable [3]. We expected that these domains
would overlap, resulting in skepticism of smart toy data col-
lection that even the restrictions in COPPA could not amelio-
rate. Surprisingly, it seems that the COPPA criteria assuaged
parents’ privacy concerns on average.
While we are encouraged that COPPA generally aligns
with parents’ privacy expectations, we are also concerned
that the existence of COPPA may give parents an unreason-
able expectation that their children’s data is protected, espe-
cially since parents familiar with COPPA were less critical
of smart toy information ﬂows. In fact, several online ser-
vices and Internet-connected toys have been found to violate
COPPA [6,43], and many more non-compliant toys are likely
available for purchase. Additionally, the information collec-
tion guidelines in COPPA are relatively broad, leaving room
for technical implementations that adhere to the letter of the
law but still compromise children’s privacy. This motivates
continued work by regulators and researchers to identify toys
that place children’s privacy at risk, as well as healthy skep-
ticism by parents before purchasing any particular toy.
As an additional policy insight, variations in information
ﬂow acceptability across recipients2 corroborate previous
work [58] indicating that privacy norms are deeply contin-
gent on the perception of entities that collect online data.
COPPA distinguishes between ﬁrst- and third-parties, but
does not further categorize data recipients. This increases the
ﬂexibility of the law, but raises the potential that some recip-
ients, which may viewed as completely unacceptable by pri-
vacy norms, could still legally get access to children’s data.
This suggests that incorporating a more contextual framing
of entities could improve the ability of future regulation to
prevent unwanted data collection practices.
6.2 Further Policy Analysis Applications
The CI survey method is not limited to COPPA. We would
like to see the results of follow-up studies focusing on differ-
ent regulation, such as the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act (FERPA), the National Cybersecurity Pro-
tection Advancement Act, the European General Data Pro-
tection Regulation (GDPR), and others from the local to in-
ternational level, to see if their requirements result in simi-
larly acceptable information ﬂows for members of their tar-
get populations. As most privacy regulation encompasses in-
formation transfer or exchange, the theory of contextual in-
tegrity is an appropriate framework for this research. Further
2Information ﬂows to ﬁrst-party manufacturers have higher average ac-
ceptability scores than ﬂows to third-party service providers (Figure 3).
studies would also allow cross-regulatory analysis to ﬁnd
common factors that affect alignment with privacy norms.
The CI survey method could also be incorporated into the
policymaking process. Policy formulation and resource al-
location could be guided by surveying a wide-variety of in-
formation ﬂows allowed under current regulation and iden-
tifying egregious or unexpected norm violations that require
attention. Policymakers could test whether previous regu-
latory approaches will be applicable to new innovations by
conducting surveys with CI parameters describing new tech-
nologies and existing regulation (e.g., smart toys and COPPA
prior to the 2017 inclusion of IoT devices [16]). Policymak-
ers could also perform A/B tests of policy drafts with differ-
ent stipulations and/or language by conducting multiple par-
allel surveys with varying CI parameters. These and other
use cases would improve quantitative rigor in data-driven
policy development and facilitate the design of regulation re-
sponsive to the privacy norms of affected populations.
6.3 Systems Design Applications
The application of CI surveys to guide systems and prod-
uct design is covered in detail in our previous work [3]. To
summarize, device manufacturers can conduct CI surveys to
determine whether information collection practices of de-
vices or new features under development will violate con-
sumer privacy norms. This allows modiﬁcations during the
design process to prevent consumer backlash and public re-
lations debacles.
Applying CI surveys to evaluate privacy regulation can
also yield valuable insights for systems research and devel-
opment. For example, learning that parents value the ability
to revoke consent or delete information (Figure 3) motivates
research into veriﬁable deletion of cloud data from IoT plat-
forms. Such insights are especially relevant as neither pri-
vacy norms nor regulations are necessarily tied to technical
systems feasibility. Discovering that a particular CI param-
eter value is crucial to privacy norm adherence could launch
several research projects developing efﬁcient implementa-
tions or correctness proofs. We expect future applications
of the CI survey method will generate many such results.
7 Conclusion
Increased interest in data privacy has spurred new and up-
dated regulation around the world. However, there are no
widely accepted methods to determine whether this regula-
tion actually aligns with the privacy preferences of those it
seeks to protect. Here, we demonstrate that a previously de-
veloped survey technique [3] based on the formal theory of
contextual integrity (CI) can be adapted to effectively mea-
sure whether data privacy regulation matches the norms of
affected populations. We apply this methodology to test
whether the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act’s re-

strictions on data collection by Internet-connected “smart”
toys align with parents’ norms. We survey 195 parents of
children younger than 13 about the acceptability of 1056
smart toy information ﬂows that describe concrete data col-
lection scenarios with and without COPPA restrictions.
We ﬁnd that information ﬂows conditionally allowed by
COPPA are generally viewed as acceptable by the sur-
veyed parents, in contrast to identical ﬂows without COPPA-
mandated restrictions. These are the ﬁrst data indicating the
general alignment of COPPA to parents’ privacy norms for
smart toys. However, variations in information ﬂow accept-
ability across smart toys, information types, and respondent
demographics emphasize the importance of detailed contex-
tual factors to privacy norms and motivate further study.
COPPA is just one of many U.S. and international data
privacy regulations. We hope that this work will serve as a
template for others to adopt and repeat the CI survey method
to study other legislation, allowing for a cross-sectional and
longitudinal picture of the ongoing relationship between reg-
ulation and social privacy norms.
