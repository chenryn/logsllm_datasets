### Title: Revisiting Stealthy Sensitive Information Collection from Android Apps at Black Hat Asia 2023

In recent years, most countries and territories have implemented stringent regulations to protect user privacy. Ensuring that mobile applications comply with these privacy policies has become essential for users, app developers, and device manufacturers. However, this task is challenging, as modern mobile operating systems like Android provide multiple channels through which third-party apps can access sensitive information. In addition to the official APIs regulated by the permission system, apps can exploit other channels such as native calls, Java reflection, Binder services, WebView, and even vulnerabilities. Existing techniques based on static and dynamic analysis often fail to cover all possible channels. Network traffic analysis is also ineffective when sensitive data is encrypted before transmission.

In this session, we will address this challenge using a low-level detection method. Our approach is inspired by the fact that almost all sensitive information is encoded into a String before it is passed to the application level. By hooking the String constructor at the native level, our method can monitor and check all strings constructed on the mobile device. This strategy is both straightforward and comprehensive, as it allows us to monitor any string constructed from sensitive information, regardless of the methods used by malicious apps to obtain it.

We have implemented this approach in a tool and used it to analyze pre-installed apps on several Android devices. Our tool discovered that many of these apps collect user information in various scenarios, such as clipboard and Wi-Fi information. Some apps even use previously unknown channels to obtain sensitive user information. Our investigation revealed that these channels are often the result of OEM manufacturers' improper control over the permissions of their customized APIs. We have reported these issues to the relevant manufacturers, who have acknowledged our findings.
