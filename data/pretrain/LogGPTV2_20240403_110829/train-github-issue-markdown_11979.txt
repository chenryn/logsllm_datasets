Would like the ability to have meta data per property in the mapping, and have
GET mapping return it.
    {
      theytype: {
        properties: {
          field1: {
            type: "long",
            _meta: {
              info:"field1 info"
            }
          },
          field2: {
            _meta: {
              info:"urls mutli field info"
            },
            type: "multi_field",
            path: "just_name",
            omit_norms: true,
            fields: {
              field2: {type: "string", analyzer: "snowball"},
              rawfield2: {type: "string", index: "not_analyzed"}
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
It looks like I could use fielddata for this too, however seems like a hack,
and I wasn't sure if it would hurt performance. Feature might be useful for
folks who want to add comments.
