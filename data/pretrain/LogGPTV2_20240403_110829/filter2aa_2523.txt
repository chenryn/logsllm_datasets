I have access to POS terminals in the US, 
what is the best malware I should use?
58
You need to infect the firmware of the terminal. 
By doing that, you can get full track 1 + 2, 
but the PIN will be hashed.
59
Selling malicious firmware for Verifone’s POS terminals.
Leaks dumps + PINs through GPRS. 
Price: Only 700$
60
Business Development Offer
Owner of a fake POS sells his terminal.
Price: 50% from revenue sharing.
61
RFI: Change terminal configuration to require PIN for all cards.
Cause: Get only 101 data, but wants PINs
