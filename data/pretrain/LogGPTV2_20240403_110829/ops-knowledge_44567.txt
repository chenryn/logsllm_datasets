User: I wonder what is the best way to handle parallel SSH connections in python.
I need to open several SSH connections to keep in background and to feed commands in interactive or timed batch way.
Is this possible to do it with the paramiko libraries? It would be nice not to spawn a different SSH process for each connection.
Thanks.
Assistant: This might not be relevant to your question. But there are tools like pssh, clusterssh etc. that can parallely spawn connections. You can couple Expect with pssh to control them too.
