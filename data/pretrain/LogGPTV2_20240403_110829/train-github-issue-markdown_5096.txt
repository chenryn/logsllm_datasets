### Description
A textbox is added to the UI next to each DAG to write/modify information
regarding the DAG directly in the UI.
### Use case/motivation
I work on a team and currently we are unable to relay information regarding a
DAG through the UI. For example: reason why a maintainer temporarily disabled
a particular DAG.  
The _DAG doc_md_ is not very useful in this case since that lives in code -
which has to go through a review process. It is a better candidate for
displaying lasting information in our case.  
In general, this feature can be used to display/modify any information
regarding a DAG.
