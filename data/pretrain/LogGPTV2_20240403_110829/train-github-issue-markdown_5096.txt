### Description
A new textbox will be added to the user interface (UI) next to each Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This textbox will allow users to write or modify information related to the DAG directly within the UI.

### Use Case/Motivation
Our team currently lacks a way to communicate information about a DAG through the UI. For example, we cannot easily provide the reason why a maintainer temporarily disabled a particular DAG. The `doc_md` field in the DAG code is not suitable for this purpose, as it requires going through a code review process and is better suited for displaying more permanent information.

By adding this feature, we can display and modify any relevant information about a DAG directly in the UI, making it easier for team members to stay informed and up-to-date.
