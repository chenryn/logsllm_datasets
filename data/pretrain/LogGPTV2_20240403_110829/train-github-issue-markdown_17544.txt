## üêõ Bug
PyTorch programs that use autograd crash on exit with Python 3.9.0a6. The
underlying cause is the same as #38228, but changes to the implementation of
`PyEval_RestoreThread` means this happens much more frequently in Python
3.9.0a6 than with previous Python versions.
In previous Python releases, threads that called `PyEval_RestoreThread` after
the interpreter shutdown would deadlock. Now they call `pthread_exit(0)`,
which triggers the issue in #38228.
The implementation of `PyEval_RestoreThread` has changed between alpha
releases of 3.9.0 and may change in the future, so we might not want to rush
any fixes.
The crash happens on exit with a message like:
    terminate called without an active exception
    Aborted
Example:
    import torch
    torch.set_num_threads(1)  # optional
    x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
    x.sum().backward()
Tested on PyTorch master (`324dc16`) and Python 3.9.0a6.
