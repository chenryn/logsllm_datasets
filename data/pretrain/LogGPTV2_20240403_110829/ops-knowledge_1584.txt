User: Simple question: is running homebrew while in a virtualenv a bad idea?
If so, is there any way that I can automatically deactivate the virtualenv each time I run a homebrew command? I don't trust myself to always remember to deactivate the virtualenv or open a new terminal window.
Assistant: I don't think if they are related. You have to use pip for python package management when you use virtualenv. this way you make sure that your new stuff is on the sandbox you created. AFAIK home-brew installs stuff globally. So better not use it to get the python modules. hope it helps.
