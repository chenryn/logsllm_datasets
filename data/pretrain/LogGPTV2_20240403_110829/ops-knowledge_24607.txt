Although the "S" in SNMP stands for "Simple," I have not found it to be particularly straightforward. I am currently preparing to deploy my software on approximately 180 remote Linux servers and need to monitor these servers and configure my daemons from a centralized point.

I am seeking a library that can truly be described as "SNMP Made Easy." Specifically, I am looking for a suite of software that is easy to work with, both in terms of installation and configuration, and does not hinder the development process. From a Network Operations Center (NOC) perspective, the ideal solution would require minimal to no maintenance once installed.

Please note that open-source solutions are mandatory.

In response to your request, I am still in the process of finding an easy-to-use suite of SNMP tools and APIs. In my experience with developing Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OA&M) systems, I have tried several options, including NET-SNMP, Windows SNMP, and most recently, agentpp (www.agentpp.com). Among these, I found agentpp to be the most user-friendly.

Good luck with your deployment!
