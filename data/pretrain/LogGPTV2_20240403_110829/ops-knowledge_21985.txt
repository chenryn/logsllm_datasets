User: How do I learn where the source file for a given Python module is installed? Is the method different on Windows than on Linux?
I'm trying to look for the source of the datetime module in particular, but I'm interested in a more general answer as well.
Assistant: Not all python modules are written in python. Datetime happens to be one of them that is not, and (on linux) is datetime.so.
You would have to download the source code to the python standard library to get at it.
