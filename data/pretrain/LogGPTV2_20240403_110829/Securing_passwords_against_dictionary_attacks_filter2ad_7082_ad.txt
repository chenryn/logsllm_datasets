### 5. RELATED WORK AND REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHENTICATION METHODS

#### 5.1 Requirements for Authentication Methods

In this section, we identify key functional requirements and criteria to evaluate the costs and benefits of user authentication technologies in the context of commercial service providers on the Internet. We will then review related work in light of these criteria.

Authentication technology on the Internet is primarily used to grant users access to their accounts. Therefore, the requirements for authentication technology are driven by the needs of the services they enable and restrict. Since the service provider (not the end user) ultimately decides which authentication technology to deploy, we will list some common requirements from a service provider's perspective.

**1. Availability:**
Web-based services should be accessible from a variety of machines that generally have only standard tools, particularly a web browser. Users expect to access their email and Internet stock trading accounts from any machine, such as computers in Internet cafes. To ensure availability across different applications and usage scenarios, authentication methods must be portable and usable on various devices.

**2. Robustness and Reliability:**
A legitimate user should always be able to log into their account without issues. This ensures that the authentication method is both robust and reliable.

**3. User Friendliness:**
Internet services aim to provide a good user experience and often encourage usage. For example, electronic payment processing via Internet banking is more cost-effective for banks than handling paper checks or telephone banking. Therefore, the authentication step should not confuse or deter users. It should be non-confrontational, easy to understand, and ideally, as seamless and invisible as possible.

**4. Low Deployment Costs:**
From the service provider's perspective, authentication technology should be cost-effective to implement and operate. This includes not just technical costs but also the significant costs associated with customer support calls if users encounter difficulties logging into their accounts.

Despite known security weaknesses, passwords remain the most widely used authentication mechanism. This can be attributed to their alignment with the above requirements. Service providers could switch to more secure technologies, but they will only do so if the expected benefits outweigh the switching costs.

We have outlined some common functional requirements for authentication technology. Another important factor is the potential loss from account break-ins. For services like web-based email or those containing personalized information (e.g., financial data), the risk is typically borne by the user, not the provider. In many cases, there are no financial losses for either party, and hackers may not gain much financially from breaking into these accounts. The main risk is the compromise of a userâ€™s privacy, which is carried by the user, not the service provider. However, service providers face a risk to their reputation, especially if their business relies on customer trust. The eBay break-ins, for example, highlight the real risk to a service provider's reputation, although it is difficult to quantify the exact impact on sales. Despite this, the reputational risks provide at least a moderate incentive for service providers to improve security against account break-ins.

From a risk management perspective, passwords work reasonably well for most applications, even for large platforms like eBay, where fraud cases are commercially insignificant compared to the overall number of transactions. Service providers are likely to be reluctant to adopt high-cost solutions. Emerging identity services, such as Microsoft Passport or the Liberty Alliance, which offer "single sign-on to the Internet," present higher payoffs for hackers, making attacks more likely. The ongoing public discussion around the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of these identity services suggests that they still need to gain consumer trust and may thus be more susceptible to reputational risks, encouraging them to implement strong security mechanisms. A detailed analysis of risk allocation in electronic commerce is beyond the scope of this paper. For more information, see Bohm et al. [4].

The research community has proposed several interesting methods to enhance the security of user-chosen passwords. This is a promising and necessary field of research that may lead to stronger authentication schemes. However, the practical deployment of authentication schemes in the mass market must consider factors such as available standard software tools, existing infrastructure (e.g., reader devices), and the functional requirements outlined above. We will now examine some related work on authentication from this perspective.

#### 5.2 Existing User Authentication Mechanisms

**1. Strengthening Passwords:**
One approach to strengthening passwords involves helping users choose better ones. Password management systems can enforce rules, such as requiring passwords to have at least six characters including a numeral. Another method is using password cracking programs to test the strength of user passwords. Alternatively, servers can assign strong passwords directly to users. However, these stronger passwords may be difficult to remember, and if different service providers have varying strategies, users would need to remember multiple passwords. This contradicts the common user practice of reusing the same password across multiple accounts. Additionally, rejecting user passwords during account creation can be counterproductive for businesses aiming to attract users, as it makes authentication more cumbersome. Thus, enforcing strong passwords leads to several usability issues.

**2. Hardware-Based Solutions:**
Hardware-based authentication methods use smartcards, tokens, and devices that generate one-time passwords. The main drawback is the cost. It is unclear who should bear the expense, and providing smartcard readers adds additional costs. Requiring smartcards for login violates the portability requirement. Usability problems arise when users lose or forget their devices. Unless different service providers build a unified infrastructure, users would need a different hardware token for each service, which is a major obstacle to adoption. Biometric authentication techniques, which require extra hardware, also face similar portability issues. Therefore, hardware token methods are unlikely to become a universal authentication method soon.

**3. High-Entropy Secrets:**
Another class of software-based authentication methods uses high-entropy secrets stored on the client machine, such as client certificates and secret keys. The main challenge is ensuring that the certificate and secret key are available on any new machine the user wants to use. Secure storage of secret keys is another issue.

**4. Keystroke Dynamics:**
A biometric scheme that does not require special readers enhances password entropy by measuring keystroke dynamics while the user enters their password. For commercial mass-market applications, the reliability of the authentication method is crucial. False negative rates (where a legitimate user is denied access) must be negligible. Empirical tests suggest that false negative rates are still significant, and further research is needed to reduce them to a commercially acceptable level. Portability remains an issue due to differences in keyboards and the inability of some devices (e.g., PDAs) to support such methods.

**5. Additional Software:**
Requiring users to download additional software for authentication can be a hurdle. Service providers prefer to avoid this for usability reasons, as it may confuse consumers and discourage system use. In settings like Internet cafes, where users cannot install extra software, the portability requirement is violated.

**6. Graphical Passwords:**
Graphical password schemes replace textual passwords and are easier for humans to remember while having higher entropy. Although this is an interesting research area, widespread adoption requires significant changes in user behavior and training. Early adopters face usability and bootstrapping challenges. If only 10% of a million-user base cannot handle the transition, it could result in 100,000 costly support calls. Risk-averse service providers, such as financial institutions, may be reluctant to introduce potentially disruptive technology.

#### 5.3 Our Approach

We believe that the RTT-based authentication scheme proposed in this paper meets all the requirements outlined above. The scheme is portable, as string RTTs can be displayed by any standard web browser, and no additional software downloads or hardware tokens are required. User behavior remains largely unchanged, and users only need to remember their passwords, as they do today. Mass deployments by PayPal, Yahoo!, and AltaVista have shown that users can handle RTTs without major issues, provided they are not required to solve them too frequently. These deployments also demonstrate that serving RTTs can scale up to mass deployments. Integrating our basic RTT scheme with deployed password management software is straightforward, requiring only minor changes in the control logic and the well-understood process of placing cookies on client machines. This integration is relatively easy and does not incur high costs for service providers. The low costs make it likely that the scheme will be adopted even by service providers with only a moderate incentive to improve their authentication technology.
