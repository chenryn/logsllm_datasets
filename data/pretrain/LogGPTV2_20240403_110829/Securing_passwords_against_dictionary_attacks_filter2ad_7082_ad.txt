causes accounts to lock, until it implements a new RTT that

5. RELATED WORK AND REQUIREMENTS
FOR AUTHENTICATION METHODS
5.1 Requirements for authentication methods
In this section we identify some functional requirements
and criteria to estimate the costs and beneﬁts of user au-
thentication technology in the context of commercial service
providers on the Internet. We will then review related work
with respect to these criteria.
Authentication technology on the Internet is typically used
to give users access to their accounts. Thus the requirements
for the authentication technology are driven by the require-
ments of the services to which they enable (and restrict)
access. As the service provider (and not the end user) is the
party that ultimately makes the decision which authentica-
tion technology to deploy we will list some common require-
ments from a service provider’s perspective.
The ﬁrst requirement is availability. Web based services
should be accessible from a number of machines that can in
general only be expected to have standard available tools,
in particular a web browser. A typical user expects to ac-
cess his email and Internet stock trading account from any
machine he has access to, for example from computers in
Internet cafes that he might use on vacation. To ensure
availability for most applications and usage scenarios, au-
thentication methods must also be portable among a number
of diﬀerent computers and devices.
The second criterion is robustness and reliability, i.e. a
legitimate user should always succeed in logging into his
account.
The next criterion is user friendliness. Internet services
strive to provide a good user experience and many of them
try to encourage usage. For example processing payments
electronically via Internet banking is much cheaper for the
bank than processing paper checks, telephone banking or
worse, having the customers walk into the branch [4]. Thus
the authentication step should not confuse even a fraction
of the users, in order not to reduce usage or drive potential
customers away from the service. The authentication step
should be non-confrontational and should not require a steep
learning curve. Ideally authentication should be as seamless
and as invisible as possible.
Another key requirement from the service provider per-
spective is that authentication technology should have low
costs to implement and operate. These deployment costs go
beyond purely technical costs, but also involve the signiﬁ-
cant costs for customer support calls, in case users are not
able to log into their accounts.
Passwords are the most widely used authentication mech-
168anism today, despite their known security weaknesses. This
phenomenon can probably be explained by the fact that
passwords score well with relation to all of the requirements
above. Service providers could in principle switch to a more
secure authentication technology. However, rational service
providers will only switch to a new technology if the ex-
pected beneﬁts exceed the switching costs.
We have listed above some of the common functional re-
quirements for authentication technology. Another impor-
tant factor to is the loss that is incurred by account break-
ins. For services such as web based email or sites that con-
tain personalized user information (e.g. ﬁnancial informa-
tion), the risk is typically carried by the user, not by the
provider. Furthermore in many scenarios there are typically
no ﬁnancial losses incurred by any of the parties. In par-
ticular hackers may not be able receive much ﬁnancial gain
from breaking into these accounts. The main risk is that the
privacy of a user’s information is compromised. This risk is
carried by the user, not the service provider. Here service
providers carry mostly a risk to their reputation, in particu-
lar if part of their business is based on conﬁdence and trust
of their customers. The press around the eBay break-ins
(see e.g. [8]) demonstrates that this risk to the reputation of
the service provider is real, although we do not know how
it exactly translates into lost sales. In spite of the fact that
these risks to reputation are harder to quantify, we believe
that they give service providers at least a moderate incentive
to improve security against account break-ins.
To keep things in perspective it is important to remember
that, from a risk management perspective, passwords work
reasonably well for most applications (even eBay states that
fraud cases are commercially non-signiﬁcant compared to
the overall amount of transactions). Service providers are
likely to be reluctant to adopt solutions with high costs.
Emerging identity services such as Microsoft Passport or
the Liberty Alliance that enable a “single sign-on to the
Internet” present higher pay-oﬀs for hackers and thereby
make attack attempts more likely. The ongoing public dis-
cussion around the security, privacy and trustworthiness of
identity services suggests that identity services still need to
gain the trust of consumers and may thereby are suscepti-
ble to higher risks to their reputation, encouraging them to
implement good security mechanisms. A detailed analysis
of which risks are carried by which party in an electronic
commerce scenario is beyond the scope of this paper. We
refer the reader to Bohm et. al [4] for more information on
the allocation of risks in, e.g., Internet banking.
The research community has made a number of interest-
ing proposals that improve the security provided by user-
chosen passwords. This is a promising and necessary ﬁeld
of research, and may eventually lead to much stronger au-
thentication schemes. On the other hand, commercial mass-
market deployment of authentication schemes is a practi-
cal problem, which needs to consider factors such as the
available standard software tools, the existing infrastructure
(e.g. reader devices) and the functional requirements out-
lined above. We will now look at some of the related work
on authentication from this perspective.
5.2 Existing user authentication mechanisms
The ﬁrst approach for strengthening passwords aims at
helping users to choose better passwords. Password man-
agement systems may enforce certain rules (e.g. requiring
passwords to have at least 6 characters including a numeral,
etc). Another variant of this approach is the use of pass-
word cracking programs [3, 24] to test which user passwords
can be easily broken. Yet another solution is to directly
assign to users strong passwords that are chosen by the
server. The main drawback of this approach is that these
stronger passwords might not be easily remembered by the
users. Furthermore, if diﬀerent service providers have dif-
ferent strategies to enforce strong passwords, users would
have to remember a number of diﬀerent passwords. This
runs contrary to the common user strategy of reusing the
same password with many accounts. An additional problem
is that rejection of user passwords during account opening
may not be a smart move for businesses who want to at-
tract users, as it makes authentication more cumbersome.
We can therefore conclude that enforcement of strong pass-
words leads to a number of usability problems.
Hardware based solutions for authentication technology
use smartcards, authentication tokens and hardware devices
that generate one-time passwords. The obvious drawback of
these devices is their expense. It is unclear who should pay
for the cost of the devices. The use of smartcards incurres an
additional expense of providing users with readers, as mass-
market computers today are not equipped with smartcard
readers. Requiring smartcards for login would therefore vi-
olate the portability requirement. Usability problems occur
when users lose or forget their devices. Another usability
problem is that unless diﬀerent service providers build a
uniﬁed infrastructure (that is very complex and expensive),
users would have to use a diﬀerent hardware token for ev-
ery service to which they enroll. Requiring users to carry a
diﬀerent token per service could be another major obstacle
for adopting this technology. The universal access issue is
also relevant to biometric authentication techniques which
require extra hardware, as consumer computers are not typ-
ically equipped with biometric sensors. We conclude that
hardware token methods are unlikely to become a universal
authentication method any time soon.
Another class of software based authentication methods is
based on high entropy secrets that are stored on the client
machine, such as client certiﬁcates and the corresponding
secret keys. The main challenge for this method is portabil-
ity, namely making sure that the certiﬁcate and the corre-
sponding secret key can be available on any new machine a
user would like to use. An additional problem is the secure
storage of secret keys.
Another type of a biometric scheme that does not require
special readers, enhances the entropy of user passwords by
measuring users’ key-stroke dynamics while they enter their
passwords (cf., e.g. [17, 18] and references given therein).
For commercial mass-market applications the reliability of
the authentication method is a key requirement. In partic-
ular the false negative rate has to be negligible [18] (a false
negative occurs when a legitimate user enters his (correct)
user name password pair, but will be denied access). Em-
pirical tests [18] suggest that false negative rates are still
signiﬁcant (in the single digit percentage for reasonable pa-
rameters). Further research might be able to drive down
these ﬁgures to a commercially acceptable level. Portability
might still clearly remain an issue, since diﬀerent keyboards
could lead to diﬀerent measurements (e.g. using American
vs. German keyboards), and devices such as PDAs may not
be able to support such methods at all.
169Another general hurdle for authentication methods occurs
when their use requires downloading additional software. It
is our experience that service providers would like to avoid
this for usability reasons, as it may confuse consumers and
discourage them from using the system. Furthermore, there
may be situations (such as Internet cafes) where users are
not allowed to install extra software, i.e.
the portability
requirement is violated.
Another class of authentication methods replaces textual
passwords altogether by graphical password schemes [13,
23]. Graphical passwords could presumably be easily re-
membered by humans but have signiﬁcantly higher entropy
than text based passwords. Although this is an interesting
line of research, massive deployment of this technology re-
quires signiﬁcant changes in current user behavior and will
require user training. Thus early adopters of this technology
are likely to deal with signiﬁcant risks in terms of usability
and bootstrapping the system.
If only 10% of users of a
service with a 1 million customer base would not be able to
handle such a transition this might lead to 100,000 (costly)
support calls. Service providers that are conservative and
risk-averse, such as ﬁnancial institutions, might be reluctant
to introduce a new, and potentially disruptive, technology.
5.3 Our approach
We believe that, in contrast to the technologies surveyed
here, the RTT based authentication scheme proposed in this
paper scores very well with relation to all the requirements
stated above. The scheme i is portable as string RTTs can
be displayed by any standard web browser. No additional
software downloads or hardware tokens are necessary. User
behavior remains almost unchanged. Users only need to
remember their passwords, as they do today. Mass deploy-
ments by PayPal, Yahoo! and AltaVista have demonstrated
that users are able to handle RTTs without major problems,
at least as long as they are not required to solve RTTs too
often. Additionally, these deployments demonstrate that
serving RTTs scales up, at least in principle, to mass deploy-
ments. Integration of our basic RTT scheme with deployed
password management software appears easy – it only re-
quires changes in a limited set of code in the control logic
of the software, and the process of placing cookies on client
machines is well understood. Thus the integration of our
RTT authentication scheme with existing systems appears
to be relatively easy and does not lead to high costs for
service providers. The low costs lead us to the conclusion
that the scheme has a good chance of adoption even for ser-
vice providers that are only moderately incentivized to make
their authentication technology more secure.
