User: Please briefly explain the function of each layer in the TCP/IP protocol stack.
Assistant: The TCP/IP protocol stack is a network protocol system that includes multiple protocol layers. It is mainly divided into four layers: 1. Application Layer (Application Layer): Provides the interface between the user and the application program, and provides communication services for the application program, such as HTTP protocol, FTP protocol, etc. 2. Transport layer (Transport Layer): Provide end-to-end data transmission services to ensure reliable data transmission, such as TCP protocol, UDP protocol, etc. 3. Network Layer (Network Layer): Carry out routing selection and packet transmission, and provide cross-network data transmission services, such as IP protocol, ICMP protocol, etc. 4. Physical Layer: Define physical connection standards, perform actual transmission and analysis of data, such as Ethernet protocol, DSL protocol, etc. Among them, the application layer and the transport layer are mainly responsible for the communication between applications, the network layer is mainly responsible for the transmission of data in the network, and the physical layer is responsible for the actual data transmission and reception. It can be said that the functions of each layer are independent of each other, but they have an inseparable relationship. Only the four layers work together to realize the function of network communication.
