Lessons Learned
Since our proposal provides a fundamentally secure
physical-layer building block for ToA measurement, this
changes prevailing assumptions on the design of higher level
protocols. In [21], Clulow et al. put forward principles for
distance bounding:
”We propose a number of principles to adhere
to when implementing distance-bounding systems.
These restrict the choice of the communication
medium to speed-of-light channels, the communi-
cation format to single bit exchanges for timing,
symbol length to narrow (ultra wideband) pulses,
and protocols to error-tolerant versions. These
restrictions increase the technical challenge of
implementing secure distance bounding.”
Given the above designs, these recommendations don’t
seem to hold up. Also, the recommendation to single bit
timing is not only not needed but also are fairly wasteful.
Again, from [21]:
”We show that proposed distance-bounding proto-
cols of Hu, Perrig, and Johnson (2003), Sastry,
Shankar and Wagner (2003), and ˇCapkun and
Hubaux (2005, 2006) are vulnerable to a guessing
attack where the malicious prover preemptively
transmits guessed values for a number of response
bits.”
In this work, we show that these vulnerabilities are an
artifact of a somewhat naively designed physical layer and
modulation, and can be addressed purely on the physical layer.
The problem and its solution are orthogonal to the design and
security of the protocol that builds in it, which operates on a
different level of abstraction, making different assumptions
about the security parameter (i.e., the bits) making up the
nonces. These protocols not addressing the physical layer
does not mean they are necessarily vulnerable. If coupled
with a physical layer that is in line with our design, they are
secure, within the performance region we point out.

its MTAC region is not smaller than the one resulting from the Gaussian

Appendix B.
Attacker Statistical Parameters
We choose the attacker’s parameters under minimization
of the worst-case distortion, i.e., as
(ˆµD ˆA
, ˆσD ˆA
) = (µD ˆA
(d ˆA,ideal), σD ˆA
(d ˆA,ideal))
d ˆA,ideal = arg min
d∈[0,dmax]
µD ˆA
(d) − σD ˆA
(d),
and the parameters of the legitimate transmitter under maxi-
mization of the distortion, within the deﬁned performance
region, i.e., as
(ˆµDlgt , ˆσDlgt ) = (µDlgt (dlgt,worst), σDlgt (dlgt,worst))
dlgt,worst = arg max
d∈[0,dmax]
µDlgt (d) + σDlgt (d).

Validating the Gaussian Variance Model
likelihoods. We provide those plots for a frame of 32 bits
and a selection of communication distances, both for LoS
and NLoS scenarios. Figure 17 presents those results for the
attacker’s variance distribution. The relevant distance for the
resulting MTAC region boundary is around 100m for LoS
and around 10m for NLoS. This is the distance at which the
distortion for the attacker is minimal, see Figure 13. There
is a slight downwards bend of the empirical value for higher
quantiles. This means, a slightly bit more than expected high-
variance outliers compared to the Gaussian hypothesis. This
is in line with our requirements, i.e., the normal estimate
being conservative regarding distinguishability. The plots for
those distances show that the empirical quantiles are well
aligned with the straight diagonal. Figure 18 presents those
results for the attacker’s distortion distribution. The relevant
distance for the resulting MTAC boundary is around 200m
for LoS and around 20m for NLoS, i.e., mid-range. The plots
for those distances show that the empirical quantiles are well
aligned with the straight line at those distances relevant for
the MTAC region derived in Section 7.
In the following, we motivate the Gaussian model for
the distortion distribution put forward in Equations 2 and 3.
Appendix D.
Effect of Frame Length
Figure 19 shows the security level for one particular
distance as a function of the frame length. It becomes evident
that bit-level equivalence of the security level is maintianed
as the length of the frame increases. We see that attacker’s
advantage decays faster than 2−nb .
C.1. Extrapolation vs. fully empirical results
In the following, we compare our extrapolated results
from Section 7 to a fully empirical (i.e., Monte-Carlo)
simulation. The probability of winning as a function of the
performance level is shown in Figure 15 for LoS conditions
and Figure 16 for NLoS conditions. Both results refer to
a frame of 20 bits. For both scenarios, we see that the
the attacker’s advantage evolves almost identically. We see
that the fully empirical results indicate a slightly wider
MTAC region, which suggest our Gaussian model to be
a conservative estimate.
C.2. Variance distribution is sufﬁciently Gaussian
We provide quantile-quantile (QQ) plots that compare
the empirical distributions against normal distributions. This
allows to validate the model we use in Section 7 which serves
extrapolate the empirical classiﬁcation performance to small
