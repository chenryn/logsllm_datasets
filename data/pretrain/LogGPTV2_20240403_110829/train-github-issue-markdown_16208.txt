**Description**
When using `KubernetesPodOperator` with the option `do_xcom_push=True`, I
would also like to be able to change the image being used by the sidecar
container that extracts the JSON file from the main container.
**Use case / motivation**
I would like to have all images pulled from a private repository. Main reason
being that I've seen rate limiting issues with Docker Hub, since the image
being pulled for the sidecar container is `alpine:latest`. It would be helpful
if I can set Airflow's behaviour to pull a mirror of this image from ECR.
