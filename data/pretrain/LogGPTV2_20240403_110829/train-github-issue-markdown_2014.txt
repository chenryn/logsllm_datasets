There was recently a change to the UniqueEntity Validator: symfony/doctrine-
bridge@`40941a3`
This has changed it's behaviour. It used to "return" if any value was null.
Now, it continues if a value is null.
This means that if you have 1 null value and 1 non null value, it only matches
the criteria to the single value.
I think this is quite a big BC break. Would love to get some feedback on this
change.
We now have validation that is failing when we use 2 fields (one has a value
and the other is null). We need it to only validate if both are not null.
