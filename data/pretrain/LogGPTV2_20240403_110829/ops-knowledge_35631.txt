User: I've added a new queue to a python GAE app, and would like to add tasks to it, but always get an UnknownQueueError when I run my tests. On the other hand, I see the queue present in the GAE admin console (both local and remote). So the question is (1) do I miss something when I add a task to my queue? (2) if not, then how can I run custom queues in a test?
Here is my queue.yaml

queue:
- name: requests
  rate: 20/s
  bucket_size: 100
  retry_parameters:
    task_age_limit: 60s

and my python call is the following:

taskqueue.add(queue_name="requests", url=reverse('queue_request', kwargs={"ckey":ckey}))

any ideas?
Assistant: If your are running a unitest and using init_taskqueue_stub() you need to pass the path of the queue.yaml when calling it using the root_path parameter.
