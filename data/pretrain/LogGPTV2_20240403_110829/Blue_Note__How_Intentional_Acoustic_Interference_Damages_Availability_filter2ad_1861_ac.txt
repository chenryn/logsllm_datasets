### Ultrasonic Interference and HDD Throughput Loss

**Introduction:**
Ultrasonic waves can induce significant throughput loss in hard disk drives (HDDs) by exploiting the resonant frequencies of their internal sensors. This document explores the mechanisms and observations related to this phenomenon, focusing on a Western Digital Black 2.5” WD1600BJKT HDD.

**A. Vulnerable Sensor Mechanics**

**Spoofing the Shock Sensor:**
Shock sensors in HDDs can be spoofed by vibrating the sensor mass at its resonant frequency, causing it to produce a false output. This is similar to techniques used to spoof MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes. The shock sensor's output, which normally represents the object's vibration, can be altered by exploiting resonant frequencies, leading to an incorrect representation of the actual vibration.

**Demonstration:**
- **Experiment Setup:** A PKGX-14-4010 MEMS shock sensor evaluation module, believed to be the same as the one in the Toshiba MQ01ABF050 HDD, was used.
- **Normal Operation:** The sensor's output under normal conditions is approximately 1.6 V.
- **Under Acoustic Interference:** When subjected to a 27 kHz tone at 130 dB SPL, the output drops to 0.6 V, indicating a misperceived acceleration over ten times that of Earth's gravity at sea level.

**Throughput Loss from Sensor Spoofing:**
- **Mechanism:** A spoofed sensor can cause the HDD to park its read/write head, leading to throughput loss.
- **Experimental Confirmation:**
  - **Step 1:** Playing inaudible sound at the resonant frequency of the shock sensor (27 kHz at 125 dB SPL) resulted in throughput loss (Figure 8).
  - **Step 2:** Removing the shock sensor and measuring throughput with and without acoustic interference confirmed that the sensor's erroneous output caused the throughput loss.

**B. Sensor Throughput Loss Observations**

**Binary Throughput Loss:**
- **Observation:** The HDD either operates normally or experiences complete throughput loss (Figure 9a). Partial throughput loss is not possible because the root cause is head parking, which is a binary state (parked or operational).

**Similar Amplitudes for Read and Write Blocking:**
- **Observation:** The amplitudes required to block reads and writes are similar (Figure 9b). This may be due to the firmware's threshold for head parking being similar, though not identical, for both operations.

**C. Pathologies During Testing**

**Consistent Resonance Despite Manufacturing Variation:**
- **Observation:** Drives of the same model exhibit similar characteristics when subjected to acoustic interference, despite minor process variations.
- **Experiment:**
  - **Profiled Drive:** One Western Digital Blue WD5000LPVX HDD was profiled to identify the most vulnerable frequency.
  - **Tested Drives:** Thirteen other drives of the same model were subjected to this frequency, resulting in consistent denial of read and write capabilities.
- **Conclusion:** The most vulnerable frequencies remain consistent across drives of the same model, allowing an adversary to predict and exploit these frequencies.
