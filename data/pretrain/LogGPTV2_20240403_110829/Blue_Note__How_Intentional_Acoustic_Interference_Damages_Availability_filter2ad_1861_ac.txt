Fig. 8. A 31 kHz ultrasonic wave at 125 dB SPL induces complete throughput
loss on a Western Digital Black 2.5” WD1600BJKT HDD.
A. Vulnerable Sensor Mechanics
Spooﬁng the Shock Sensor. One can vibrate the shock
sensor mass at its resonant frequency to induce false sensor out-
put similar to prior work on spooﬁng MEMS accelerometers [8]
and MEMS gyroscopes [17]. Shock sensors work similarly to
MEMS accelerometers in that vibration of a sensing mass
creates a voltage representative of the motion perceived by
the sensor. By placing a shock sensor on an object, the shock
sensor can produce a voltage representative of the object’s
vibration. However, one can make the vibration of the mass
of the piezo shock sensor different from the vibration of the
object by exploiting resonant frequencies. This difference in
vibration results in an altered output different from output that
represents the actual vibration of the object.
We demonstrate altering output of a PKGX-14-4010 MEMS
shock sensor evaluation module, which we believe is the same
unit inside the Toshiba MQ01ABF050 HDD (Figure 7). The
output of the shock sensor module under normal operation
(with no intentional acoustic interference) is approximately
1.6 V. However, the output becomes 0.6 V when subjected
to a 27 kHz tone at 130 dB SPL—translating roughly to a
misperceived acceleration of over ten times the acceleration of
Earth gravity at sea level.
Throughput Loss from Sensor Spooﬁng. A spoofed
sensor can lead to throughput loss by making the HDD inad-
vertently park its head. Under intentional acoustic interference,
the shock sensor or accelerometer will report a false value
to the HDD ﬁrmware. This false value implies that the HDD
is moving violently, such as if it were dropped, and needs
to park the read/write head. It follows that an attacker could
continuously falsify the sensor’s output to keep the head parked
indeﬁnitely, preventing the HDD from writing or reading.
Our experiments conﬁrm throughput
loss from sensor
spooﬁng. First, we play inaudible sound at a resonant frequency
of the shock sensor in the HDD (27 kHz at 125 dB SPL),
which results in throughput loss (Figure 8). Second, to conﬁrm
that it is indeed the shock sensor that causes the throughput
loss, instead of read/write head or disk vibration, we removed
the shock sensor from the drive and measured throughput
with and without acoustic interference. This conﬁrms that the
sensor’s erroneous output caused by acoustic interference leads
to throughput loss.
B. Sensor Throughput Loss Observations
Binary Throughput Loss.
The throughput of the HDD
is either unaffected or lost completely as shown in Figure 9a.
This method cannot induce partial throughput loss as head
parking is the root cause to throughput loss. The head can only
be either parked or operate normally (assuming no other kind
of interference).
Similar Amplitudes to Block Reads and Writes. An-
other observation is that write blocking and read blocking
require similar amplitudes for sensor induced throughput loss
shown in Figure 9b. This observation may be because the
ﬁrmware’s threshold for head parking is similar, but not exactly
the same for reads and writes.

VI. PATHOLOGIES DURING TESTING
We observed several pathologies while testing HDDs with
malicious acoustic interference including: HDDs of the same
model exhibiting similar characteristics under attack and seeing
unusual levels of bad sectors.
A. Consistent Resonance despite Manufacturing Variation
During testing, drives of the same model showed similar
characteristics when subjected to acoustic interference. We
attribute slight differences to process variation. Our obser-
vations are consistent with previous research [5] that shows
unremarkable frequency-dependent variation across of drives
of the same model. Thus, an adversary could proﬁle one drive
to predict the frequencies that most affect a victim drive of the
same model.
To test this characteristic, we proﬁled one Western Digital
Blue WD5000LPVX HDD to discover the frequency that
most affects drives of this model. Then we subjected 13
other drives of the same make and model to this frequency.
The vibration denied each drive from being able to read or
write. We also observed that ultrasonic interference exhibited
consistent resonant frequencies across drives of the same model.
In practice, we ﬁnd that the most vulnerable frequencies remain
