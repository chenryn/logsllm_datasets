INTRODUCTION
The downward spiral in the cost of connected devices and
sensors (e.g., cameras, motion sensors, remote controlled
light switches) has generated a vast amount of interest to-
wards using them in the home environments. Companies and
researchers are developing technologies that employ these
devices in a diverse range of ways. These include improv-
ing energy eﬃciency, increasing comfort and convenience
through automation, implementing security and monitoring,
and providing in-home healthcare.
However, conducting experimental work in this domain
is extremely challenging today. Evaluating the eﬀectiveness
of research prototypes typically requires some form of de-
ployment in real homes. This task is riddled with not only
social and legal constraints, but also logistical and technical
hurdles. Examples include recruiting participants, hardware
and software setup in the home, training participants and
residents who typically possess varying levels of technical ex-
pertise, and diverse security and privacy concerns. Because
of these challenges, individual research groups rarely man-
age to deploy their prototypes on more than a dozen or so
homes concentrated in their geographic area. Such deploy-
ments tend to lack the scale and diversity that is needed to
conﬁdently answer the research hypothesis.
Our goal is to lower the barrier towards deploying ex-
perimental technology in a large number of geographically
distributed homes.

Figure 1: HomeLab will consist of multiple sites
across the world, each with multiple homes recruited
and managed by a research group.
We are inspired by PlanetLab, which enabled the develop-
ment and evaluation of global network services. Analogously,
we are developing a shared infrastructure for home environ-
ments, called HomeLab. We envision HomeLab to comprise
of a large number of homes in various parts of the world,
where each home hosts a common framework, in which ex-
periments can be run (illustrated in Figure 1). Individual
research groups that participate in HomeLab recruit and
manage dozen or so homes. They can then run their experi-
ments on other groups’ homes in exchange for letting others
run experiments on their homes. The vision and rationale of
HomeLab was outlined in a workshop paper last year [1].
Since then we have made signiﬁcant progress on its design
and implementation. Our initial design is guided by what we
have found, based on our experience and by talking to other
researchers, to be common tasks in deploying home technol-
ogy. These include: (i) collection of sensor data for analysis
by residents or researchers, e.g., energy or water consump-
tion, or camera snapshots (ii) monitoring of sensors for de-
cision making or actuation, e.g., adaptive heating control,
or fall detection for seniors, (iii) collection of logs of users’
interaction with sensors/devices. A common framework for
such tasks would greatly simplify the eﬀort needed by indi-
vidual research groups and it would also enable code re-use
and sharing of expertise.
This demonstration will illustrate the capabilities of Home-
Lab including: (i) the ease of hardware setup, (ii) the ease
of application development for complex experiments involv-
ing multiple devices, sensors, and datastreams, (iii) the each
of remote experiment deployment, monitoring, and update,
(iv) the ease of data collection, and (v) incorporation of dif-
493ferentiated access to data and devices (e.g., to address par-
ticpants’ privacy concerns, obtain ethics board approvals).
Our hope is to encourage researchers to become part of
HomeLab and obtain feedback that will help us improve its
design.
2. HOMELAB DESIGN
In HomeLab terminology, an experiment is a research ap-
plication running (e.g., energy use monitoring, occupancy
sensing) on a number of homes. To help conduct an exper-
iment, HomeLab provides 1) a common framework to write
applications, and 2) a set of capabilities such as updating
applications and warehousing application data in one place.
We build on top of HomeOS [2] as a application-development
framework. HomeOS provides a PC-like abstraction for in-
home hardware and simpliﬁes the tasks of writing appli-
cations and managing sensors. This framework decouples
experiment-speciﬁc logic from the generic mechanisms and
semantics required by, (a) researchers to robustly interact
with in-home sensors, and (b) by participants to interact
with sensors and their applications. This decoupling enables
sharing and reuse of engineering eﬀort, experiences, exper-
tise in building in-home and supporting infrastructure, and
possibly experimental data across research groups. Many re-
search groups are already using HomeOS for developing re-
search applications and course projects.
The set of supporting capabilities that are part of Home-
Lab include the following:
Eﬀortless setup: Simplifying the often complex and te-
dious setup of sensors in a home, HomeLab provides a uni-
ﬁed interface for a researcher or participant to setup and
conﬁgure in-home hardware.
Simple experiment development: HomeLab maintains
the beneﬁts of homogeneity that HomeOS oﬀers to applica-
tion developers. For instance, an application can collect en-
ergy consumption data using various types of sensors while
being agnostic to sensor-speciﬁc protocols (e.g., Zwave, Zig-
bee, or WiFi).
Extensible support for devices: HomeLab supports a
wide range of oﬀ-the-shelf devices (e.g., many Zwave sensors,
IP cameras) as in-home sensors, and provides mechanisms
for new devices or prototypes to be added, used, and shared
amongst the research community.
Remote experiment deployment: HomeLab provides re-
searchers with robust mechanisms for advertising their ex-
periments to potential participants, deploying, monitoring,
and updating their experiments remotely, while preserving
participants’ preferences.
Data durability and access: HomeLab incorporates a
Home Data Store which provides seamless transfer of appli-
cation data to the cloud, and handles scarce in-home storage,
and intermittent network connectivity. As a result, experi-
menters get reliable, low-latency access to their data, con-
ducive for data analysis.
User security and privacy: Experiments involving end-
user applications can easily incorporate robust user authen-
tication and authorization. For instance, experimenters do
not need to re-design parental control, guest access, out-of-
home access to applications, or DoS prevention components
in their applications.
Figure 2: Example in-home hardware.
Experiment scheduler A global scheduler is responsible
for scheduling and running experiments based on the needs
of the experiment (e.g., speciﬁc hardware or geographic lo-
cation). The scheduler also needs to maintain isolation of
experiments running in the same home. Our current exper-
iment scheduler is simplistic, however. It fully dedicates a
home to one experiment. We are trying to better understand
experimental conﬂicts and their prevention.
Miscellaneous services: Experiments that may require
other functionalities such as email, SMS, or IM notiﬁcations,
can easily avail the respective pre-existing services oﬀered by
HomeLab while exerting little additional design eﬀort.

IMPLEMENTATION AND STATUS
We have developed all of the capabilities outlined above.
We have tested our current implementation with many oﬀ-
the-shelf devices, .NET Gadgeteer 1 devices, using a mod-
erately powered netbook running our in-home framework
(HomeOS). Figure 2 shows such a setup consisting of a net-
book, a Foscam IP camera, and Aeon Zwave door-latch,
water-leaks sensors and power switch. Cloud services run
on Microsoft Azure, to provide remote access for home user
and experiment management for researchers.
