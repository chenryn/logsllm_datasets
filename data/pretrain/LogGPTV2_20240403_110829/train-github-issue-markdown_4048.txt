### Apache Airflow version
2.4.0
### What happened
On our Airflow 2.4.0 instance, we have 1 weekly report (schedule `17 10 * *
1`) and 1 monthly report (schedule `30 0 9 * *`) (and no others). The dags
didn't have their schedules changed (which appears to be related to the 1.10
issue). They are both built in python files that have other dags, most of
which are daily. I have also briefly tested extracting the weekly run out into
its own file, and it also does not run on schedule.
Neither of them execute. Today (2022-10-11), the weekly dag still reports
`Next Run: 2022-10-10, 10:17:00`.
The monthly DAG (which should have run on the 9th), has iterated to next
month. I pinpointed the point in which it rescheduled the next execution to
the next month, which was exactly 24 hours after the scheduled runtime. I
therefore suspect the weekly dag also to be rescheduled later today

### What you think should happen instead
The dags should execute based on their schedule.
### How to reproduce
Our airflow distribution is in a git repo and can be easily deployed as
temporary development servers. I can confirm this gets reproduced in duplicate
deployments, and so I do not believe this behavior is specific to our
instance.

### Deployment details
We have a production instance that primarily servers as our Airflow hub, and
so this is a pip-based global install
### Anything else
I'd be happy to submit a PR if we can identify the issue.
