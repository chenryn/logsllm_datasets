### Complete Survey Descriptions

For completeness, we include the language and flow of our two surveys below. Demographics for the two samples are included in Table 6.

#### A.1 Complete Description of Survey One

Respondents were randomized into either the salary scenario or the medical scenario, described below.

**Salary Scenario:**
Imagine that you work in the banking industry. You are friends with a group of other people who work in banking companies in your city. One of your friends is part of a transparency initiative that is trying to publish general statistics about pay in the banking industry. As part of this initiative, they have asked everyone in the group to share their salaries and job titles using an online web form on the initiative’s website.

**Medical Scenario:**
Imagine that during your next doctor’s visit, your primary care doctor informs you that they are part of a non-profit organization trying to push the boundaries of medical research. This non-profit is asking patients around the country to share their medical records, which will be used to help medical research on improving treatment options and patient care. Your doctor, with your permission, can facilitate the non-profit getting the information they need.

**Questions:**
- Which of the following would you want to know before deciding whether or not to share your [salary/medical history]? Select as many as apply.
- For each of the non-other options selected by the respondent, they were shown one of the following three options, selected independently at random:
  - [leak entity] will not learn your [salary/medical history].
  - [leak entity] might learn your [salary/medical history]. The chance this happens is about the same as the chance that your bank account will be compromised (accessed by a person who you did not intend to gain access to) as part of a data breach in the next year.
  - [leak entity] might learn your [salary/medical history]. The chance this happens is higher than the chance that your bank account will be compromised (accessed by a person who you did not intend to gain access to) as part of a breach in the next year.

**Final Questions:**
- Would you be willing to share your [salary/medical record] with the [initiative/non-profit]?
- [If Yes] Why would you be willing to share your [salary/medical record]?
- [If No] Why would you not be willing to share your [salary/medical record]?
- [If I’m not sure] Why are you unsure whether you would be willing to share your [salary/medical record] with the [initiative/non-profit]?

#### A.2 Complete Description of Survey Two

Respondents were randomized into either the salary scenario or the medical scenario, described below. In both scenarios, respondents were randomly shown a description of differential privacy, listed after the scenarios.

**Salary Scenario:**
Imagine that you work in the banking industry. You are friends with a group of other people who work in banking companies in your city. One of your friends is part of a transparency initiative that is trying to publish general statistics about pay in the banking industry. As part of this initiative, they have asked everyone in the group to share their salaries and job titles using an online web form on the initiative’s website. [description from the list of differential privacy descriptions, shown below.]

**Medical Scenario:**
Imagine that during your next doctor’s visit, your primary care doctor informs you that they are part of a non-profit organization trying to push the boundaries of medical research. This non-profit is asking patients around the country to share their medical records, which will be used to help medical research on improving treatment options and patient care. Your doctor, with your permission, can facilitate the non-profit getting the information they need. [description from the list of differential privacy descriptions, shown below.]

**List of Differential Privacy Descriptions:**
- (Control:) no additional text
- (Unsubstantial:) To reduce the intrusion into personal privacy, your friend says they will use a technique called differential privacy. Differential privacy is the gold standard in data privacy and protection and is widely recognized as the strongest guarantee of privacy available.
- (Techniques:) To reduce the intrusion into personal privacy, your friend says they will use a technique called differential privacy. Differential Privacy injects statistical noise into collected data in a way that protects privacy without significantly changing conclusions.
- (Enables:) To reduce the intrusion into personal privacy, your friend says they will use a technique called differential privacy. Differential Privacy allows analysts to learn useful information from large amounts of data without compromising an individual’s privacy.
- (Trust:) To reduce the intrusion into personal privacy, your friend says they will use a technique called differential privacy. Differential privacy is a novel, mathematical technique to preserve privacy which is used by companies like Apple and Uber.
- (Risk:) To reduce the intrusion into personal privacy, your friend says they will use a technique called differential privacy. Differential privacy protects a user’s identity and the specifics of their data, meaning individuals incur almost no risk by joining the dataset.
- (Technical:) To reduce the intrusion into personal privacy, your friend says they will use a technique called differential privacy. Differential privacy ensures that the removal or addition of a single database item does not (substantially) affect the outcome of any analysis. It follows that no risk is incurred by joining the database, providing a mathematically rigorous means of coping with the fact that distributional information may be disclosive.

**Questions:**
- Would you be willing to share your [salary/medical record] with the [initiative/non-profit]?
- [If Yes] Why would you be willing to share your [salary/medical record]?
- [If No] Why would you not be willing to share your [salary/medical record]?
- [If I’m not sure] Why are you unsure whether you would be willing to share your [salary/medical record] with the [initiative/non-profit]?

**Additional Statements:**
For each of the following statements, please indicate if you expect the following to be true or false if you share your salary and job title as part of this initiative.
- (Organization:) [My friend will not be able to learn my salary and job title/The contents of my medical record will be stored only by my doctor’s office, and will not be stored by the non-profit]
- (Hack:) A criminal or foreign government that hacks the [transparency initiative/non-profit] could learn my [salary and job title/medical history]
- (Law Enforcement:) A law enforcement organization could access my [salary and job title/medical history] with a court order requesting this data from the [transparency initiative/non-profit]
- (Data Analyst:) A data analyst working [on/for] the [salary transparency initiative/non-profit] could learn my exact [salary and job title/medical history]
- (Graphs:) Graphs or informational charts created using information given to the [salary transparency initiative/non-profit] could reveal my [salary and job title/medical history]
- (Share:) Data that the [salary transparency initiative/non-profit] shares with other organizations doing [salary/medical] research could reveal my [salary and job title/medical history]
