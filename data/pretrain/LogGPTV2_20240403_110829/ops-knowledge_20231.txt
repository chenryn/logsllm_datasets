User: I installed Python 3.5 from source and broke a number of modules on Python 3.4, which unfortunately, was an essential part of Ubuntu. I've been trying to fix the system, now I'm almost there, with (hopefully) the last problem: My Python 3.4 only recognize C modules with name *.cpython-34m.so, while all packages from Ubuntu repository are named *.cpython-34m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so. It seems that the cpython-34m stuff is the full name of Python, so I need to change it in accord with Ubuntu's expectation. How can I achieve this?
Assistant: I reinstalled Python 3.4 via Ubuntu package system, and suddenly everything worked fine. I still have no clue how Ubuntu customize its own Python, since Python's configure command has no related option at all. Anyway, it works, so why bother :P. Finally, thank you for helping me with this problem.
