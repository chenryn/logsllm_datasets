C. CPS Probing Orchestration Fingerprinting
Indeed, the previously inferred CPS probing events ap-
pear to originate from independent probing sources. However,
consistent with Section III-C, we now execute the proposed
approach to examine the existence of orchestrated CPS probing
events. The proposed approach identiﬁed 9085 probing events
generated from 58 campaigns. Figure 6 provides a holistic
depiction of the inferred campaigns, where the nodes represent
unique source IP addresses and the edges represent the exis-
tence of a concrete derived similarity based on the analyzed
generated probing trafﬁc per the proposed approach of Section
III-C; one can notice the appearance of several large-scale CPS
probing campaigns. In the sequel, we only elaborate on 5 of
those campaigns that were shown to be of large-scale (i.e.,
have at least 50 sources). It is noteworthy to mention that
around 60% of the inferred campaigns (including those 5 large-
scale campaigns) possessed a very low portsweep probing rate,
rendering them independent and/or undetectable by typical
intrusion detection systems or ﬁrewall rules. In contrast, our
proposed methods in terms of inference algorithm and orches-
tration ﬁngerprinting, can evidently assess those seemingly-
independent probes to infer their underlying coordination.

We have encountered a unique probing behavior while
investigating probing campaign A of Table VIII. The campaign
has indeed conducted 6 operations during the analyzed one-
month period. In fact, we have identiﬁed this orchestrated
campaign operating in a product of 16 unique hosts, leveraging
64 (16 × 4) distinct IP addresses, running in parallel, from
random ports, and searching for a speciﬁc list of CPS protocols
in the following sequence: Modbus on TCP port 502, Niagara
Fox on TCP port 1911 and BACnet on TCP port 47808.
On average, for each protocol, 14 requests were sent
to
different dark IP addresses. It is apparent that this campaign
is speciﬁcally searching for online CPS.
Concerning campaign B of Table VIII, its probing strategy
is quite different from that of the ﬁrst campaign. Instead of
mainly targeting CPS services, this campaign probed a variety
of services. In fact, the average number of services probed per
unique host is 191, some of which are Modbus and BACnet.
Furthermore, the campaign “recycled” 13 new hosts every
week and their probes originated from random source ports.
Moreover, in contrast to the ﬁrst campaign, which mainly
utilized TCP to probe, this second campaign leveraged more
services such as UDP, NBNS, CoAP, MDNS, ISAKMP, ENIP,
and QUIC. The collected information from such probes could
be used by malicious entities to perform vulnerability analysis
on a larger number of publicly reachable CPS services.
In contrast to the aforementioned two campaigns that were
generated from unsolicited yet known sources, we now detail
three inferred orchestrated campaigns that we deem as being
malicious, given that their domains pointed to suspicious hosts
and/or their IP addresses did not reﬂect any known/benign
entities.
One of the largest inferred campaigns (campaign C of
Table VIII) that meet such criteria originated from numerous
locations in the United States and Germany. The campaign
consisted of 188 distinct hosts conducting large-scale scan-
ning in a stealthy manner. Generally, this campaign targeted
each destination IP address for a maximum of 5 times. The
campaign targeted Modbus 30% of the time, in addition to
several other services such as CWMP, HTTP and HTTP-
ALT, and HTTPS. In fact, the campaign initiated its scans
against Modbus, followed by a UDP and an HTTP scan. While
probing Modbus, this campaign leveraged only two source
ports, 40849 and 63419, among all 188 hosts. This may serve

probing tools/techniques/malware. Due to the non-interactive
nature of darknet trafﬁc analysis, it is rather difﬁcult to clarify
the aim of this campaign’s activities. However, our claim is
that, given that the abused services which are tagged along
with Modbus, include, CWMP, SSH and HTTP, this campaign
can be dedicated to execute CPS brute force attacks. In fact,
by cross-matching the campaign’s IP addresses against the
previously noted publicly available threat repositories, 68.7%
of them were found to have been previously reported for SSH
and HTTP brute force attacks.
Another unique campaign (campaign D of Table VIII) orig-
inated from various cities in China. This campaign leveraged
116 IP addresses, during two non-consecutive weeks in the
analyzed one-month period. The campaign targeted Modbus
and BACnet, yet also focused on ports 80 and 443. After
manual inspection, we noticed that many-to-one brute force
HTTP and HTTPS requests are being extensively generated
through different source ports. We postulate that this campaign
is targeting the Human Machine Interface (HMI) of CPS.
Last but not least, we also identiﬁed a relatively short
coordinated scan, campaign E of Table VIII, that remained
active for a one week period. Attributed to Russia, this cam-
paign is dedicated towards probing the Foundation Fieldbus
HSE. While the campaign only leveraged 54 IP addresses,
however, it has contacted almost all (98%) of our darkspace
by generating trafﬁc from random source ports within the
30k and 50k range. Such probes could identify vulnerabilities
within this protocol’s implementation, such as the IP multicast
features on Foundation Fieldbus systems, which are typically
not well protected.
V. DISCUSSION
Our overall proposed models, approaches and techniques
leverage network telescopes to infer CPS probing activities.
Thus, we now present some of the assumptions that underlie
our analysis,
in addition to some challenges and ways to
leverage the obtained results to enhance CPS security.
Attackers’ IP Address Selection: Our newly deployed dark-
net IP address space is still at its infancy. Thus, the proposed
approach is unable to monitor and infer events that do not
target our sensors. This can occur when attackers use an
already published hit list or test speciﬁc and known vulnerable
services. Although such methods will allow scans to avoid
being detected or assessed by our approaches, adversaries in
general prefer to employ up-to-date and various hit lists of
services to decrease their chances of being detected and to
increase their chances of launching subsequent attacks. To
achieve this, at least one global scan is needed to ﬁrst assess
the impact of the attack; a scan that would probably hit our
sensors. To this end, we obviously do not claim that we did not
miss any other Internet-scale CPS probing activity, however,
our collaborators and us, are not aware of any worldwide
reported CPS probes that were not (at least partially) inferred
by our proposed methods during the analyzed period.
Incomplete view of the CPS abuse: As briefed in Section
II, our approach falls under passive network trafﬁc monitoring.
As such, since we do not interact with incoming trafﬁc, we
can only observe the ﬁrst communication packets related to
the CPS protocols. Consequently, our approach cannot draw
a holistic view of the complete CPS abuse beyond such
communication attempts. This is a typical limitation though
of analyzing network telescope one-way trafﬁc.
Defense against scanning: Evidently, by using our de-
ployed network telescope, a signiﬁcant number of CPS scan-
ning activities reached our networks, probing for Internet
services including a variety of CPS-speciﬁc services. The
nature and intent of these events are at best hard to be
concretely veriﬁed. Therefore, it is important to have defensive
mechanisms in place to protect networks and CPS realms
against potentially malicious subsequent activities. The ﬁrst
step in defending against such malicious trafﬁc consists of
detecting the scanning activities. For instance, after a CPS
scanning campaign has been identiﬁed, CPS operators can
proceed with deploying solutions to protect against it. One so-
lution in the case of known/unsolicited campaigns is to report
the scans and request exclusion of a particular network address
space from subsequent scans. Legitimate campaigns often have
mechanisms in place for excluding networks from their scans.
In the event that exclusion requests are not possible, or are
not respected by the scanning entities (i.e., in the case of
malicious CPS scanning activities), incoming network trafﬁc
from source IP addresses that are repeatedly involved in such
scanning activities can be dropped with the use of blacklists.
Such lists can be intuitively built based on darknet analysis.
Ideally, deploying darknets at different locations can provide
more global and accurate blacklisting information.
Indeed, the most difﬁcult step in defending against scans
and their subsequent activities is detecting the scanning activ-
ities, since deploying solutions such as reports and blacklists
are relatively straightforward. Unfortunately, as [54] uncovers,
the vast majority of networks do not proactively detect scans,
but rather accidentally discover them during maintenance or
troubleshooting. Scanning activities leave footprints in IDSs,
ﬁrewall logs, webserver logs etc., that can aid in detecting them
and extracting scanners’ source IP addresses for consequent
blacklisting. However, going through the logs can be a tedious
and error-prone process that can resolve in a large number of
false positive and false negative results, which can have an
unwanted effect on the network’s operation. To this end, we
recommend the use of a network telescope within or external
to CPS environments, similar to the one deployed and reported
in this paper. Incoming trafﬁc to the network telescope’s
dedicated IP addresses can be automatically analyzed to detect
scanning activities and pinpoint the scanners’ source IP ad-
dresses. A positive side effect of this approach is that the anal-
ysis of the darknet trafﬁc can reveal other useful patterns for
CPS administrators, such as misconﬁguration errors, infected
CPS devices, ongoing malicious campaigns, etc. For large CPS
networks, interactive CPS honeypots can be complementary
deployed, which can further assist in identifying the intent and
nature of the incoming trafﬁc.
Research Trends: Recent network telescope analysis fo-
cused mostly on large-scale Internet scanning activities with
the goal of detecting scanners and identifying broad patterns in
their scanning behavior [54]. This aspect in network telescopes
research can be attributed to the emergence of highly efﬁcient
scanning tools and techniques, which can scan the entire IPv4
address space in just a few minutes. We strongly believe
12
in an effort
that network telescope research will shift towards specialized
per-protocol analysis, relatively similar to the one presented
here,
to generate ﬁne-grain cyber-intelligence.
Such a shift would be in line with the evolution of the threat
landscape; current threat actors, particularly Advanced Persis-
tent Threats (APTs), have become increasingly sophisticated
targeting evolving paradigms (IoT, CPS, etc.) As such, we
undoubtedly believe that future attacks will
include APTs
dedicated towards these paradigms. In this context, it would be
interesting to observe how the Internet measurement, control
and cyber security research communities would collaborate to
leverage their capabilities to contribute to the security of such
complex systems.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In a dedicated effort to capture real unsolicited and ma-
licious notions in the realms of CPS, this paper presented
a thorough investigation of CPS probing activities towards
ample of CPS protocols. The latter was achieved by examining,
analyzing and correlating various dimensions of signiﬁcant
amount of darknet data. A novel probabilistic model was
presented and employed to sanitize darknet data from miscon-
ﬁguration trafﬁc. Subsequently, inference and characterization
modules were devised to extract and analyze diverse CPS
probing events. To this end,
trends, packets’ headers and
co-occurrence patterns of such events, among others, were
reported. Additionally, in an effort to tackle the challenging
problem of inferring CPS orchestrated probing campaigns by
exclusively monitoring and analyzing a network telescope IP
space, we presented a hybrid approach based on time series
and netﬂow analysis methods. The outcome disclosed more
than 9 thousand orchestrated, stealthy CPS events, originating
from a plethora of unsolicited and malicious campaigns. While
Section II highlighted a number of research gaps that are
undoubtedly worthy of being investigated, we are currently de-
signing and deploying diverse CPS honeypots to infer tangible
CPS attack models. In this context, we will be leveraging the
information obtained from this work coupled with those attack
models to build tailored CPS resiliency mechanisms, from the
cyber as well as the control/physical perspective, to address
the security of CPS in the power and critical manufacturing
sectors.
