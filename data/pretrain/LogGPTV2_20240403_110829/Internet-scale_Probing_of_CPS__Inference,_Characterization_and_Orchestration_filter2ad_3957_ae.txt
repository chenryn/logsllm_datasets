**Continuous Scanning Activity and Analysis**

The scanners remained active throughout the entire analyzed period. Although we observed such continuous and consistent activities, particularly among Modbus scanners, the majority of these originated from relatively new sources, with an average of 121 new probing sources per week. Verification of their IP ranges and hostnames revealed that they are known to perform probing activities for cybersecurity and research purposes. Table VIII provides an overview of these unsolicited campaigns.

### C. CPS Probing Orchestration Fingerprinting

The previously inferred CPS probing events appear to originate from independent probing sources. However, consistent with Section III-C, we now apply our proposed approach to examine the existence of orchestrated CPS probing events. Our method identified 9,085 probing events generated from 58 campaigns. Figure 6 provides a holistic depiction of the inferred campaigns, where nodes represent unique source IP addresses, and edges represent the existence of a concrete derived similarity based on the analyzed generated probing traffic. Notably, several large-scale CPS probing campaigns were identified. We will elaborate on five of these campaigns, which were shown to be of large scale (i.e., having at least 50 sources).

#### Detailed Analysis of Probing Campaigns

1. **Campaign A:**
   - **Source:** An organization and an academic institution.
   - **Behavior:** Conducted 6 operations during the one-month period, using 16 unique hosts and 64 distinct IP addresses, running in parallel from random ports.
   - **Target Protocols:** Modbus (TCP port 502), Niagara Fox (TCP port 1911), and BACnet (TCP port 47808).
   - **Observations:** On average, 14 requests were sent to different dark IP addresses, indicating a specific search for online CPS.

2. **Campaign B:**
   - **Source:** Unspecified, but targeting a variety of services.
   - **Behavior:** Probed an average of 191 services per unique host, including Modbus and BACnet.
   - **Recycling:** 13 new hosts were recycled every week, and probes originated from random source ports.
   - **Protocols Used:** UDP, NBNS, CoAP, MDNS, ISAKMP, ENIP, and QUIC.
   - **Potential Use:** The collected information could be used for vulnerability analysis on publicly reachable CPS services.

3. **Campaign C:**
   - **Source:** Numerous locations in the United States and Germany.
   - **Behavior:** 188 distinct hosts conducting large-scale scanning in a stealthy manner.
   - **Target Services:** Modbus (30% of the time), CWMP, HTTP, HTTP-ALT, and HTTPS.
   - **Observations:** The campaign leveraged only two source ports (40849 and 63419) for Modbus, suggesting the use of the same probing tools or malware.
   - **Potential Intent:** Likely dedicated to executing CPS brute force attacks, as 68.7% of the IP addresses were previously reported for SSH and HTTP brute force attacks.

4. **Campaign D:**
   - **Source:** Various cities in China.
   - **Behavior:** Leveraged 116 IP addresses during two non-consecutive weeks, targeting Modbus and BACnet, and focusing on ports 80 and 443.
   - **Observations:** Many-to-one brute force HTTP and HTTPS requests were generated through different source ports, possibly targeting the Human Machine Interface (HMI) of CPS.

5. **Campaign E:**
   - **Source:** Attributed to Russia.
   - **Behavior:** Short coordinated scan active for one week, leveraging 54 IP addresses and generating traffic from random source ports within the 30k and 50k range.
   - **Target Protocol:** Foundation Fieldbus HSE.
   - **Observations:** Contacted almost all (98%) of our darkspace, potentially identifying vulnerabilities in the protocol's implementation, such as IP multicast features.

### V. Discussion

Our proposed models, approaches, and techniques leverage network telescopes to infer CPS probing activities. Here, we present some underlying assumptions, challenges, and ways to leverage the results to enhance CPS security.

#### Assumptions and Challenges

- **Attackers' IP Address Selection:** Our newly deployed darknet IP address space is still in its infancy, limiting our ability to monitor and infer events that do not target our sensors. Attackers may use already published hit lists or test specific and known vulnerable services, avoiding detection. However, adversaries often employ up-to-date and varied hit lists to decrease detection chances and increase attack success.
- **Incomplete View of CPS Abuse:** Our approach falls under passive network traffic monitoring, allowing us to observe only the first communication packets related to CPS protocols. This limits our ability to draw a holistic view of complete CPS abuse beyond initial communication attempts.

#### Defense Mechanisms

- **Detection and Exclusion:** After identifying a CPS scanning campaign, operators can deploy solutions to protect against it. For known/unsolicited campaigns, reporting the scans and requesting exclusion from subsequent scans can be effective. Legitimate campaigns often have mechanisms for excluding networks from their scans.
- **Blacklisting:** If exclusion requests are not possible or respected, blacklists can be used to drop incoming network traffic from source IP addresses repeatedly involved in scanning activities. Darknet analysis can intuitively build such lists, and deploying darknets at different locations can provide more global and accurate blacklisting information.

#### Research Trends

Recent network telescope analysis has focused on large-scale Internet scanning activities to detect scanners and identify broad patterns in their behavior. Future research is likely to shift towards specialized per-protocol analysis, similar to the one presented here, to generate fine-grain cyber-intelligence. This shift aligns with the evolving threat landscape, where Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) increasingly target evolving paradigms like IoT and CPS.

### VI. Concluding Remarks

This paper presents a thorough investigation of CPS probing activities towards various CPS protocols by examining, analyzing, and correlating significant amounts of darknet data. A novel probabilistic model was employed to sanitize darknet data from misconfiguration traffic, and inference and characterization modules were devised to extract and analyze diverse CPS probing events. Additionally, a hybrid approach based on time series and netflow analysis methods was presented to tackle the challenging problem of inferring orchestrated CPS probing campaigns. The outcome disclosed over 9,000 orchestrated, stealthy CPS events, originating from numerous unsolicited and malicious campaigns.

While Section II highlighted several research gaps, we are currently designing and deploying diverse CPS honeypots to infer tangible CPS attack models. These will be leveraged to build tailored CPS resiliency mechanisms, addressing the security of CPS in the power and critical manufacturing sectors from both cyber and control/physical perspectives.
