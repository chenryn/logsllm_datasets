this trend is the high cost of such cell phones.
3This is the typical EDGE data rate offered in Pakistan [17].
Figure 3: Distribution of WiFi standards across cell
phones in our dataset.
WiFi Interface: In our dataset, only 12.5% of the phones
had WiFi interfaces whereas 30.9% of the phones models
had WiFi support. Figure 3 shows how different WiFi stan-
dards are distributed across phones that were equipped with
WiFi interfaces. Interestingly, 53.6% of the phones had 802.11n
capability and 39.7% had phones that only supported 802.11g.
This in contrast to countries like the US, where 97.7% of de-
vices were reported to be 802.11n capable during the same
time period [22].
It is interesting to observe that despite the popularity of
802.11n, which supports a maximum data rate of 600 Mbps,
a signiﬁcant fraction of cell phone models (∼46.1%) are still
limited to the low data rate 802.11b and 802.11g standards,
which provide a data rate of up to 11 Mbps and 54 Mbps,
respectively.
3.2 CPU/RAM
Cell phones with slow CPUs and small memory sizes often
lead to poor application performance (e.g., for web browsing
and web-based multimedia [28, 34]). Therefore, we now
present a classiﬁcation of phones based on their CPU speeds
and memory sizes.
Processor: Table 2 shows the CPU speeds of cell phones in
our database. We found that ∼32% of the phones had CPU
speeds of less than 500 MHz. While cell phones with CPU
speeds between 500 MHz and 1 GHz were most popular, cell
phones with greater than 1 GHz speeds and multiple cores
were much less popular. We found that 87% of the phone
models with slow CPUs (i.e., less than 500 MHz) supported
Email and 48% of such phones supported running third party
applications, suggesting slow performance for CPU inten-
sive tasks.

minimum and maximum CPU speeds were 104 MHz and

Memory/RAM: Figure 3 shows the distribution of memory
sizes of cell phones. We ﬁnd that 57% of the cell phones
had less than 10 MB of RAM whereas only 0.485% of the
phones had more than 1 GB of memory. The minimum and

maximum memory sizes we observed were 1 MB and 3 GB,
respectively. We found that 95% of the phones with small
memory (i.e., ≤ 5 MB) supported Email and 84% of such
phones supported running third party applications.
3.3 OS Type/Phone Status
We now discuss the distribution of mobile operating sys-
tems across phones. We found that 84.8% of the phones had
vendor-speciﬁc operating systems whose information was
not available. Figure 4a shows the distribution of cell phone
OSes across the remaining 15.2% phones (∼76k phones).
Observe that 30.8% of the cell phones used Android fol-
lowed by Symbian (31.4%).
We found that the three most popular versions of Android
were 2.3, 4.0, and 4.1 as shown in Figure 4b. The observed
mobile operating systems have well-known security vulner-
abilities as shown in Table 4 [4, 14]. As such, these devices
can be readily exploited to launch various attacks such as
DoS attacks, attacks on privacy, and memory corruption.
Phone Status: Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that 58.1% of the phones
have been discontinued or cancelled by the vendors. These
phones may be vulnerable to known security attacks as there
is no continuous vendor support for addressing them. Such
phones are likely to remain available in developing coun-
tries for quite sometime as they are low cost and reselling of
phones is fairly common in such regions.
3.4 WAP Support
A WAP browser is designed for mobile devices and uses the
WAP for Internet access. WAP 2.0 uses a cut down ver-
sion of XHTML with end-to-end HTTP. Mobile devices pro-
cess XHTML Mobile Proﬁle (XHTMLMP), the markup lan-
guage deﬁned in WAP 2.0.
We found that 49.5% of the phones supported WAP whereas
89.8% of the phone models had WAP. Figure 5 shows the
distribution of WAP versions found in our dataset. Observe
that most phones supported WAP 2.0 (76.4%) whereas only
5.5% supported WAP 1.1. We expand on this in the next sec-
tion and explore support for WAP from popular websites in
Pakistan.
Figure 5: Distribution of phones which support WAP.
4 Characterizing Support for WAP Browser
In the last section, we observed that a signiﬁcant fraction of
phones (49.5%) in our dataset supported only WAP browsers
and not modern browsers (e.g., Safari or Chrome). Recall
that unlike modern rich browsers, WAP browsers support a
stripped down version of XHTML. More importantly, WAP
browsers do not support JavaScript and do not feature rich
multimedia content (e.g., Flash and videos). Naturally, an
interesting question is this:
“Given that WAP is a dominant browser, what fraction of
websites support WAP browsers?”
To answer this question, we develop a web crawler that
visits the top 300 websites in Pakistan according to the Alexa
list [2]. The web crawler sets its “user-agent" to match those
of the most popular devices in our dataset: Nokia3360.
We compared the website delivered when the crawler used
a WAP user-agent against the website delivered when a Chrome
user-agent was used. We observed that 25% of the sites ex-
plored delivered a lighter version (with fewer images and
scripts) of their website to the web-crawler when it used a
WAP speciﬁc user-agent. Even more surprisingly, we found
that only 6% of the sites delivered truly WAP friendly ver-

Un-
surprisingly, the 6% included large online service providers
(e.g., Facebook, Google, Live, and Amazon) and several lo-
cal sites, e.g., ummat.net (one of Pakistan’s popular Urdu
newspapers).
5 Characterizing Cell Phones
To aid analysis, we now propose four abstractions for cell
phone features that represent groups of similar features4:
connectivity, capacity, ﬂexibility, and insecurity. These ab-
stractions allow us to analyze the (a) network bandwidth of-
fered by cell phones, (b) their computational resources, (c)
ﬂexibility in supporting third party applications and running
modern browsers, and (d) vulnerability of a device to known
attacks5. Moreover, by reducing the feature set, these ab-
stractions allow low-dimensional visualizations.
We then cluster cell phones based on these abstractions,
which allows us to perform (a) cross-category analysis and
answer questions such as: do cell phones with high speed
network interfaces have enough computational resources to
utilize the network bandwidth? do more ﬂexible cell phones
(e.g., that provide support for running third party applica-
tions) tend to be more insecure? and (b) allows prediction of
an abstraction (or features) given the knowledge of other ab-
stractions and similar cell phones. This can be useful when
complete information about a particular cell phone is not
available6 (e.g., if the cell phone was discontinued several
years back but is still being used). For instance, a network
service provider may use the network interface of the phone
to infer whether the device maybe using an outdated phone,
and then use a middlebox to enhance the device security.
5.1 Abstractions for Features
1. Connectivity (V): To characterize the network interface
speed offered by a cell phone, we use the average of the
maximum data rates7 offered by the cellular and WiFi in-
terfaces present in a cell phone as follows:

ported by the cellular technology and the WiFi interface
in a cell phone, respectively. Rmax

maximum data rates across all cellular technologies and
WiFi standards found in our dataset, respectively and used
for normalization. Observe that a value of V close to zero
4Other abstractions are indeed possible, however, we choose
these abstractions based on the domain knowledge about the
features we have seen.
5They allow us to reason about a collection of related fea-
tures (e.g., network connectivity as opposed to speciﬁc in-
terfaces such as WiFi, 3G, or Bluetooth).
6We could not ﬁnd information about the CPU speeds of
∼70% of the phone models in our dataset even though infor-
mation about their cellular interface was available.
7Using the maximum data rate informs us about the max-
imum access capacity, which a multi-path transport like
MPTCP can utilize under ideal network conditions.
