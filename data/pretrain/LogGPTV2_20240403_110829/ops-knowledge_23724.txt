I am currently working on integrating AJAX into my Google App Engine application and I'm in search of a suitable AJAX framework. Can anyone provide any recommendations?

I have been considering using the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). How effective is GWT for creating AJAX functionalities within a Google App Engine environment?

Assistant: For your situation, I would recommend exploring a pure JavaScript framework like jQuery to handle your client-side code. You can then create JSON services using Python, which is a popular and straightforward approach.

The Google Web Toolkit allows you to develop the user interface in Java, which is then compiled into JavaScript. As Dave mentioned, GWT may be more advantageous if your backend is written in Java, as it provides convenient Remote Procedure Call (RPC) features for that scenario.
