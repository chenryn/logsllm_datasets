In the field tactics of an attacker, the two on the left are the
most advantageous, whereas the two on the right are the most prob-
lematic and the exact reasons why you cannot predict outcomes
but only stack the odds in your favor, which I will circle back to
in a moment.
For now, let’s break the categories down. There are certain
things that are apparent as you walk into a building. Unless you are
disguised, the first person or people you meet, most often the first
line of defense within an organization, know that you are which-
ever gender you are and how you look physically. These two things
are known to you, too. They are “Known by All.” There’s nothing
magical about this category. Everything you know and that is also
known by the outside world (upon interaction) is represented in
this category. Known by All includes factors like accent, health sta-
tus (broadly speaking), and confidence level. As an attacker, you
want the faux reason you are there to be in this category, too. If you
show up as a mechanic, look like one. If you show up as the boss,
look like one based on that company’s culture.
220 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
The pane directly below Known by All is Hidden. Hidden is
both your objective and what your pretext conceals. Hidden is why
you are there in the first place and the basis of the attack; it is also
your AMs as applied to the attack. The Hidden pane is perhaps the
most important set of things you are in charge of. It’s everything
you don’t want revealed about yourself; it’s the bolstering cause and
effect of the operation and should be protected at all costs. It is the
employment of every skill and law of the mindset.
Known by Target(s) is my least favorite category but perhaps
the most important to play around with mentally. How your tar-
get thinks of their job, feels about their role, and what they know
about their environment and perceive of you are all contained
within this category. Those are all things that can go either for or
against you. Scary, right? Well, I do have one piece of good news:
the previous figure misrepresents the size of the panes. They are
not all equal, because some have more influence than others. Real-
istically, the categories should be represented by their impact on
the whole engagement. If I had started out like that, they would’ve
looked more like the following graphic, give or take, based on the
skills of each attacker and the security culture in each individual
environment.

Ego suspension is a huge part of what I teach in my Advanced
Practical Social Engineering course and is a fundamental skill. You
can have every other facet of an attack down, but if your AMs can’t
handle the suspension of your ego, all bets are off. If you know your
ego is at play, you will have an easier time of subduing it where
Psychology in Attacks 221
and when advantageous. If you don’t and your ego falls within the
Known by Target(s) pane under Not Known to Self, you may find
many of your interactions and engagements going awry, even if
they are meticulously planned.
There’s a simple reason ego suspension is so important. It boils
down to the fact that you cannot appeal to someone else’s ego if
your own is in the way. And most of the time, you need to appeal to
your target’s ego in order to influence and steer them in the direc-
tion you need them to take. Your ego will always want you to do and
be the best, but it will help you resist doing some of the less glam-
orous things that you might have to when executing an attack, like
dumpster diving or entering through sewers or cargo bays. It might
stop you from starting your vishing calls toward the bottom of the
organizational chart because your aim is to get to the CEO, and you
shouldn’t waste your time with those lower in rank. Big mistake.
Your job is to gain information and weaponize it. No target is too
big or too small.
Target Psychology
Many attacks exploit psychology to a larger degree than technol-
ogy. As computer security professional Bruce Schneier once said,
“Only amateurs attack technology; professionals target people.”
However, that’s because it’s easier in many ways than dancing with
technology— attacking a person will yield a far greater payout than
targeting technology most of the time. I would go as far to say that
the most brilliant yet most terrifying attacks we have seen in our
lifetimes, whether it be those that threaten the global supply chain,
like the Maersk debacle, or those like Frank Abagnale’s Pan Am
pilot jaunt, contain a hefty element of AMs that rubs up against
technology only slightly.
With Maersk, it is understood that the NotPetya malware got
into corporate networks via a hijacked software update for a Ukrain-
ian tax software tool. The attack was executed via phishing emails,
which helped take down the world’s largest shipping corporation.
222 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
At the peak of infection, almost all connected assets owned by the
corporation were touched directly or indirectly by the phish. Some
of the computer screens affected read “repairing file system on
C:” with a simple warning not to turn it off. Others were a little
more menacing, reading “Oops, your important files are encrypted”
accompanied by a demand to pay $300 worth of bitcoin in order
for them to be decrypted. This onscreen messaging included a sin-
gle kiosk in a gift shop stationed within a basement in Copenha-
gen. People reportedly ran into conference rooms and unplugged
machines in the middle of meetings, and hurdled over locked key-
card gates, which had also been rendered useless by the malware.
Disconnecting Maersk’s entire global network took the compa-
ny’s IT staff about two hours, but the phish likely took far less time
to formulate and definitely less time to send. Employees—r endered
entirely idle without computers, servers, routers, or desk phones—
were left without work. Maersk ships operated normally through-
out the ordeal, but for roughly two days, affected terminals couldn’t
fulfil their function and move cargo. NotPetya affected Maersk’s
global business, too, and IT costs weren’t insignificant either.
As I pointed out earlier, this all started with phishing. But it’s
something more general that’s the true point of reference here: as
humans, when one party believes the intent is pure, a vulnerability
is created. Your AMs must use this as its compass for doing bad (for
the sake of good of course). It must be able to create a vulnerability
with that principle in mind and be able to use it to your advantage
time and time again. You create the vulnerability; you yourself are
the exploit.
This rule applies to every vector I talked about in Chapter 8,
“Attack Strategy”; with phishing, vishing, smishing, and in-p erson,
you only need the other party to believe that your intent is pure
to allow a vulnerability to be created. You may not always be able to
exploit it, but creating it is the first step in any case, and it stems,
of course, from your pretext and committing to it for as long as it
works for you.
Psychology in Attacks 223
Committing to a pretext in and of itself is powerful. Fairly
recently a Malaysian bank robber who used social engineering
as his primary weapon in a string of thefts successfully gained
$142,000 by pretending to be a fire extinguisher maintenance tech-
nician. He never broke his pretext, and what’s more, he never both-
ered to make it more convincing than the words coming out of his
mouth. Where you and I would typically dress the part of our cho-
sen pretext, this man approached his target environment carrying
a backpack and dressed casually in a T- shirt and shorts. He walked
into the bank with a single document that he claimed was a floor
plan for the building. According to local reports and CCTV footage,
he simply displayed the paper to a bank manager and requested
permission to do an inspection. He was refused access by the man-
ager upon being incapable of producing any sort of identification to
corroborate his story. But, even a bank manager needs lunch. While
the manager was away, the attacker continued to check extinguish-
ers and the whole environment continued as was normal, with staff
assisting customers and keeping business rolling. Working quickly
but discreetly, the attacker got closer and closer to the safe room,
needing only one thing to happen—f or the head cashier to access
the area. And when that happened, he essentially tailgated his way
to quite a bounty.
Niftily using a magnet on the door’s lock, preventing it from
shutting fully, he waited until the coast was clear before entering.
Once inside the secure area, he pushed a hefty amount of cash
into his backpack and walked away. In a bid to make a convincing
escape, the attacker approached a security guard and explained that
he was leaving to get additional staff to help with the inspection. All
told, he was inside the bank for less than 20 minutes and walked
away with $142,000.
In a final short example, we look to Frank Abagnale, maybe
my favorite social engineer of all time. He predates the industry
in terms of security, and he’s been on both sides of the law. His
AMs is sharp, and when combined with his instincts, he created
224 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
precise conditions that allowed vulnerabilities to be created, which
he exploited in plain sight. Frank Abagnale is most often associ-
ated with the Steven Spielberg movie Catch Me If You Can, with
Leonardo DiCaprio portraying a handsome, charming young
man using somewhat ingenious crimes as paydays. Abagnale is a
famous check forger, imposter, and con artist. He was between the
ages of 15 and 21 when he committed most of his crimes. He was
arrested multiple times in multiple countries, spending six months
in a French prison, six months in a Swedish prison, and finally four
years in a US prison in Atlanta, Georgia. That’s generally the extent
of what people know about him. But Abagnale escaped prison in
1971 in one of the most agile and AMs- centric methods you could
ask for, and unlike with many of his other exploits, Abagnale had
help this time.
Abagnale was transferred into prison by a US Marshal, who inad-
vertently forgot to give the prison his detention commitment. This
struck the administration as odd and caused the guards to believe
that he was a prison inspector sent by the FBI. Frank Abagnale was
a sharp observer by this point, so he quickly took in the information
and used it to create a vulnerability to be used against the prison. He
used his one phone call to speak to Jean Sebring (as she was named
in his book), a friend of his, and asked her to forge a business card
to back up the story the prison administrators had told themselves.
Once the card was delivered to Abagnale, he donned the pretext
they’d created for him and finally told the guards the “truth” that
they wanted to hear— that he was in fact an inspector sent by the
FBI. The guards believed him and even bragged about how they
knew all along. Ultimately, they allowed Frank to leave the facility.
Social engineering, for good or bad, when used in tandem with
AMs is a powerful force to be reckoned with, and the best way to
wield this force is to understand elements of psychology, the traits
we have in common, and the best way to exploit them. So, with that
in mind, let’s look at target psychology, beyond what was discussed
in relation to TAWM, and find out which human pressure points
your AMs is best applied to. You should know by now that AMs
has its benefits and that having a strong AMs puts you at the top
Psychology in Attacks 225
of the food chain. But to truly have a well-r ounded AMs, you will
need two things, both of which all the examples in this book have
incorporated:
• Empathy
• Knowing the pitfalls of human behavior as they pertain to secu-
rity and, specifically, to you as an attacker
Empathy is important because it allows you to place yourself
in the shoes of the target. This ability to empathize, even if it’s just
cognitive empathy, is strongly related to the ability to use human
nature against those you are attacking. This is even beneficial to
those of us that only attack digital assets; knowing how to hide
your tracks is often linked with knowing how to disguise them to
humans. Being able to place yourself in the shoes of someone else
allows you to be able to exploit the individual more easily.
Empathy is the birthplace of the principle I’ve been talk-
ing about in this chapter. As humans, when one party believes
the intent is pure, a vulnerability is created. Every breach occurs
because someone did something they weren’t supposed to do, or
somebody failed to do something they were supposed to do. This is
the perfect counterpart to knowing that the basic premise of social
engineering is that people have certain predictable characteristics
such as an innate desire to be helpful, and that, when put under
time pressure from someone they believe to be genuine, they will
be prone to bypassing basic security protocols.
Given this, I will look at three of the most potent and prevalent
biases we can use to our advantage as attackers:
• Optimism bias
• Confirmation bias and motivated reasoning
• Framing effect
Optimism Bias
People tend to overestimate the probability of positive events and
underestimate the probability of negative events happening to them
226 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
in the future, as author Tali Sharot says in her book, The Optimism
Bias (Vintage, 2012). For example, I may underestimate my risk
of getting hit by a car and overestimate my future success on the
stock market—t hat’s optimism, right? I really don’t want to be hit
by a car, but I really do want to see my stock prices go up. Another
example is that of most newlyweds underestimating the likelihood
that their marriage will end in divorce. According to the American
Psychological Association, it is estimated that 50 percent of all mar-
riages end in divorce in the United States (https://www.apa.org/
topics/divorce-c hild-c ustody).
People are optimistic. Because people are optimistic, they tend
to underestimate risks. Therefore, they engage unnecessarily in
overtly risky behavior, and you can capitalize on that as an attacker.
When a target receives emails designed to infect their machines
with malware, they don’t necessarily treat them with the suspi-
cion they deserve. Adding to this, somewhat counterintuitively,
is that the security communities have actually done a good job of
raising awareness about the perils of clicking links in phishing
emails. Countless resources explain how to spot a phish. To most
people, the danger of falling victim to a phish is reduced, which is
paradoxical, of course. But it stands to reason that the victims think
the criminals must’ve found another way by now because phish-
ing is overdone, overused, and too easily recognized. The criminals
think the targets will fall for their phish in spite of those things. The
loop continues and is likely an infinite one.
Optimism goes beyond the measures of technology, though.
Thanks to people’s inherently optimistic nature, they expose them-
selves, and the companies they work for, to threats they could eas-
ily avoid. The illusion of invulnerability, either of self or of the
organization, is something that will often present itself to you as
an attacker in the form of security by theatrics; a placebo effect, or
rather a nocebo effect transpires. Targets within the environment
will simply go through with the process they’ve been instructed to
without much critical thought. The very consideration of you being
a malicious actor either does not occur or washes over so softly that
it is basically useless. If you are presenting your pretext correctly,
Psychology in Attacks 227
leveraging your mental agility and self-a wareness and never break-
ing pretext, people will tend to believe the narrative you present
and look for signs that it is legitimate. They will most often assume
that they are not standing with a real- life threat in front of them dis-
guised with nothing more than a seemingly good reason to be there.
A number of factors can explain this optimism bias. The two
most important that I have investigated are perceived control and
being in a good mood.
With perceived control being a bolstering effect of this bias, you
can see why ego suspension is so important, as well as committing
to pretext (typically a non-a uthoritative one). Leaving the target
with the misconception they are in control is enormously impor-
tant if you are to count on optimism bias in an attack.
And though other forms of positive illusions have been identi-
fied in psychology, including self- serving bias and wishful thinking,
the illusion of control matters most to you as an attacker because
of what it is: an exaggerated belief in one’s capacity to control inde-
pendent, external events, which I tie into one with optimism. This
is the tendency for people to believe that compared to others they
are less likely to experience negative events and more likely to expe-
rience positive ones. It’s like the gambler who thinks they have a
better chance at winning than everyone else at the table, with eve-
ryone else at the table thinking the same thing.
When it comes to mood, people tend to be more optimistic in
safe settings, but when it becomes critical to recognize threats and
danger, even the greatest of optimists are prone to revising their
beliefs when faced with negative information. This is why pretexts
in combination with commitment are so important: you must pre-
sent the narrative in such a way that the target never has to think
about it as anything else other than what is being presented. If this
