### Example Code
```python
# Dummy list for posts
my_posts = [
    {"title": "Post 1", "content": "Content of Post 1", "id": 1},
    {"title": "Post 2", "content": "Content of Post 2", "id": 2},
    {"title": "Post 3", "content": "Content of Post 3", "id": 3}
]

# Function to get the index of the post by matching the ID
def find_index_post(id: int):
    for i, p in enumerate(my_posts):
        if p['id'] == id:
            return i
    return None

# DELETE request created using FastAPI
@app.delete("/posts/{id}", status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
def delete_post(id: int):
    index = find_index_post(id)
    if index is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail=f"Post with ID {id} does not exist!")
    my_posts.pop(index)
    return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
```

### Description
I recently started learning FastAPI and have been following a YouTube tutorial. I am encountering an issue with the following code: whenever I run a `delete_post` request in Postman, I receive the following error on the Uvicorn server:

```
return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
TypeError: Response.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'status_code'
```

However, in the instructor's video, the code works without any errors. I have searched and found a few related issues, but I was unable to resolve the error. I tried following the solutions provided in the issue with ID #4939, but I still encountered the following errors:

1. **Original Error:**
   ```
   return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
   TypeError: Response.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'status_code'
   ```

2. **Error when following the solution from Issue #4939:**
   ```
   raise RuntimeError("Response content longer than Content-Length")
   RuntimeError: Response content longer than Content-Length
   ```

Could you please assist me with this? Thank you!
