### Example Code
    #dummy list for posts
    my_posts=[{"title":"Post 1","content":"Content of Post 1","id":1 },
              {"title":"Post 2","content":"Content of Post 2","id":2 },
              {"title":"Post 3","content":"Content of Post 3","id":3 }  
             ]
    #function to get the index of the post which I am looking to delete by matching the ID
    def find_index_post(id):
        for i, p in enumerate(my_posts):
            if p['id']==id:
                return i
    #delete request created using FastApi
    @app.delete("/posts/{id}",status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
    def delete_post(id:int):
        index=find_index_post(id)
        if index==None:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail=f"Post with Id {id} does not 
            exist!")
        my_posts.pop(index)
        return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)
### Description
I have started learning FastApi recently and have been following one youtube
tutorial for lessons.
The issue i have been facing with this code is whenever I run delete_post
request on Postman I get below error on uvicorn server:  
"return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)  
TypeError: Response. **init** () got an unexpected keyword argument
'status_code'"  
However, in the instructors video, this is working fine without any errors.
I searched and found few issues related to this on here which I tried to
follow but couldn't get myself to resolve the error. I tried following few
solutions as provided inside below ISSUE ID but to no avail-  
" Response content longer than Content-Length error for DELETE and NoContent
#4939"
The two prominent errors I am getting are:
  * "return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)  
TypeError: Response. **init** () got an unexpected keyword argument
'status_code'  
***This is the original code which i am following from the youtube lesson
  * raise RuntimeError("Response content longer than Content-Length")  
RuntimeError: Response content longer than Content-Length  
***This is the error i am getting when I try to follow the solution provided
in Issue id "4939".
Kindly assist, Thanks!
