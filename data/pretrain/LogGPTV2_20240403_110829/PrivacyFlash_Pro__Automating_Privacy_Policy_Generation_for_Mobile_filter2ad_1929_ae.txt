### PrivacyFlash Pro: Usability and User Feedback

**System Usability Scale (SUS) Scores:**
PrivacyFlash Pro achieved a mean SUS score of 83.4 and a median SUS score of 87.5 (Figure 10). For context, a study encompassing 3,500 surveys across 273 studies, including web, UI, and hardware tools, reported an overall mean SUS score of 69.5 [16]. A mean score of 71.4 is considered good (standard deviation 11.6), and a score of 85.5 is deemed excellent (standard deviation 10.4) [16]. Thus, PrivacyFlash Pro's scores place it close to the mean of excellent scores.

**User Suggestions for Improvement:**
Several participants provided suggestions for further enhancements. The most frequent recommendation was to implement PrivacyFlash Pro as a native desktop application (suggested by 6 participants). Some developers expressed concerns about the browser-based implementation, fearing that their source code might be transmitted off their devices. Additionally, there were requests for greater transparency regarding the handling of source code during analysis (suggested by 3 participants). We plan to address these concerns by providing more detailed explanations of how PrivacyFlash Pro works within the user interface. The complete set of improvement suggestions can be found in Appendix C.

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)

We asked participants: "How likely is it that you would recommend PrivacyFlash Pro to a friend or colleague?" This single multiple-choice question allows responses on a scale from 0 (not at all likely) to 10 (very likely). Participants scoring 9 or 10 are considered promoters, those scoring 7 or 8 are passively satisfied, and those scoring between 0 and 6 are detractors. The NPS is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{NPS} = \left( \frac{p - d}{n} \right) \times 100 \]
where \( p \) is the number of promoters, \( d \) is the number of detractors, and \( n \) is the total number of participants.

PrivacyFlash Pro achieved an NPS of 42.5 (Figure 11). According to global benchmark data from SurveyMonkey, which includes over 150,000 organizations, the average NPS is 32, with technology companies averaging 35 and a median of 40 [67]. PrivacyFlash Pro's NPS places it above these benchmarks. Notably, one participant explicitly stated that they would recommend PrivacyFlash Pro without being prompted (Appendix D).

### Real-World Usage

Since making PrivacyFlash Pro publicly available, we have observed its use in generating privacy policies in the field. As of January 7, 2021, the PrivacyFlash Pro GitHub repository has been starred by 107 users, forked by 7, and watched by 5. A sample privacy policy generated using PrivacyFlash Pro is available in the project's GitHub repository [11, 12].

### Conclusions

Privacy policies are essential for disclosing online privacy practices and should provide transparent information about data usage and user rights. Privacy policy generators can help developers create compliant policies. However, current generators often rely on manual, error-prone processes. We believe that combining standardized policy templates, code analysis, and a wizard-based questionnaire can improve this process. To this end, we developed PrivacyFlash Pro and introduced it as an open-source project to the iOS developer community. The positive feedback and performance of PrivacyFlash Pro encourage us to continue in this direction.

**Future Directions:**
We see potential in extending PrivacyFlash Pro to analyze additional app features and generate corresponding policy descriptions, such as for tracking technologies. Given Apple's recent requirement for privacy labels on the App Store [49], we are also exploring how our approach can automate the label creation process. Our method could be applied beyond iOS to Android and web ecosystems, as many privacy policies cover multiple platforms and apps. Integrating policy generators into developer tools could further enhance privacy transparency and compliance.
