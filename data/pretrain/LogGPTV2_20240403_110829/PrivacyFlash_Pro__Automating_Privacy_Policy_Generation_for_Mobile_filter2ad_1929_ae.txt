PrivacyFlash Pro reached a mean SUS score of 83.4 and
a median SUS score of 87.5 (Figure 10). For comparison, for
3,500 surveys of 273 studies covering, among others, web, UI,
and hardware tools and systems, a total mean score of 69.5
was reported [16]. Mean scores of 71.4 are considered good
(standard deviation 11.6) and scores of 85.5 excellent (standard
deviation 10.4) [16], thus, placing PrivacyFlash Pro close to the
mean of excellent scores. A number of participants provided
suggestions for further improvements. The most frequent sug-
gestion was to implement PrivacyFlash Pro as a native desktop
app (6). The browser-based implementation raised concerns
with some developers that their source code would be sent off
of their devices. In a similar vein, more transparency about
what is being done with the source code during the analysis
was requested (3), which is a point that we will address with
more and detailed explanations of how PrivacyFlash Pro works
in the UI. The complete set of improvement suggestions is
available in Appendix C.
2) Net Promoter Score: We asked study participants: “How
likely is it that you would recommend PrivacyFlash Pro to
a friend or colleague?” This single multiple choice question
allows answers on a scale of 0 (not at all
likely) to 10
(very likely). Participants scoring a 9 or 10 are considered
promoters who will likely recommend PrivacyFlash Pro. Those
who gave a score of 7 or 8 are reasonably satisﬁed but would
not go out of their way. Detractors give scores between 0-6
and are dissatisﬁed. The Net Promoter Score is the difference
12
to analyze additional app features and generate corresponding
policy descriptions, for example, for an app’s use of tracking
technologies. Also, as Apple announced at
its Worldwide
Developers Conference 2020 that developers now need to
provide privacy labels for their apps on the App Store [49], we
are interested in exploring the extent to which our approach
can be used for automating the label creation process. We
also think that our approach can be used beyond iOS in the
Android and web ecosystems. In fact, many privacy policies
are intended to cover more than just one platform or app.
Thus, generator results for multiple platforms and apps would
need to be combined, possibly also with ofﬂine data collection
practices. We see the potential for integrating policy generators
like ours into developer tools. Generally, we understand our
study as an initial step towards the automatic generation of
privacy documentation.
We see a privacy tech trend that transcends disciplines
of privacy law and software engineering. The emergence of
web and app technologies has created new privacy challenges.
However, those same technologies can be used to create new
privacy solutions. If an app’s codebase is not aligned with its
privacy policy, one way to improve its alignment is to make
privacy policies traceable by generating them as far as possible
from the codebases they are intended to cover. In order to avoid
non-compliance, whenever possible, it is not only advisable
to design software with privacy built-in at its inception, but
rather to synchronize it over the course of its life cycle with
its privacy policy and other privacy documentation.
Software is not written in a vacuum;
there are social,
ethical, and legal considerations involved. By infusing the
software development process and its tools with privacy re-
quirements, developers are more likely to appreciate the need
for compliance enabling them to write more compliant code.
We think that the establishment of privacy policy generation
as a native extension of the software development process
will be beneﬁcial for both privacy transparency and com-
pliance. Software developers have embraced legal concepts
before. With the open source movement as its catalyst, many
developers came to appreciate software licensing as an integral
component of their work. We think that a similar development
is possible and desirable for privacy. Software developers can
and should be stakeholders for creating compliant privacy
policies. Adherence to a developer’s mental model is critical. If
developers can do what they are already doing — writing code
— in a programming language they already know with tools
they already use, privacy policies can become indeed software
development artifacts.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT
We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for
their detailed reviews and most excellent suggestions. We
would also like to thank Peter Story, Shaoyan Sam Li, and
Yuanyuan Feng for their invaluable assistance in the early
stages of this project and Kuba Alicki for his unit tests. Finally,
PrivacyFlash Pro would not exist without the generous funding
from Wesleyan University, its Department of Mathematics &
Computer Science, and the Anil Fernando Endowment.

Net Promoter Scores can range from -100 to 100. Priva-
cyFlash Pro reaches an NPS of 42.5 (Figure 11). According to
global benchmark data from SurveyMonkey, which accounts
for the scores of more than 150,000 organizations, the average
NPS is 32 with technology companies scoring a bit higher
with an average of 35 and a median of 40 [67]. PrivacyFlash
Pro places above these scores. Indeed, without prompting,
one participant explicitly mentioned that they will recommend
PrivacyFlash Pro (Appendix D).
3) Use of PrivacyFlash Pro in the Field: Since making
it available to the public, we started to see privacy policies
created with PrivacyFlash Pro in the ﬁeld.11. As of January
7, 2021, the PrivacyFlash Pro GitHub repository was starred
by 107 users, forked by 7, and 5 are watching it. A sample
privacy policy generated with PrivacyFlash Pro is available in
the GitHub repository of our project.12
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Privacy policies are the standard instruments for disclosing
online privacy practices. They should provide users with trans-
parent disclosures as to what happens with their data and which
rights they have. Privacy policy generators can help developers
creating legally compliant privacy policies. However, current
generators are questionnaire-based and partly ﬂawed in their
design as well as fundamentally limited by the error-prone
nature of the manual question-answering process. We believe
that the combination of standardized policy templates, code
analysis, and a wizard-based questionnaire has the potential
to improve the current situation. To that end, we created
PrivacyFlash Pro and introduced it as an open source project to
the iOS developer community. The performance and feedback
on the usability of PrivacyFlash Pro encourages us to move
further in this direction.
A host of privacy-sensitive app functionalities can be
surfaced from their code. Going forward it would be interesting
