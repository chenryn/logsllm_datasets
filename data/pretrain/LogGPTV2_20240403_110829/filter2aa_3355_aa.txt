Foreword 
The Office of the Assistant Attorney General, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) is providing funds through the 
Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) State Domestic Preparedness Equipment Program for the purchase 
of specialized equipment to help enhance the capabilities of State and local units of government to respond to 
acts of terrorism involving chemical and biological agents, as well as radiological, nuclear, and explosive de-
vices.   
This handbook is the result of a developed and focused effort by the ODP to address interoperability and is 
intended to enhance communications among the numerous agencies who would respond to large-scale terror-
ism incidents or emergencies. 
To further enhance that effort, the ODP provided more than 50 ACU/TRP-1000 systems to approximately 
10 jurisdictions across the United States under a pilot grant project.  The communities cited in the handbook 
were selected from among those provided with the ACU/TRP-1000 systems that were part of the ODP pilot 
grant project. 
The ACU/TRP-1000 system is a useful communications device for those who must establish a link with other 
local, State, and federal agencies at the scene of multi-agency response incident.  This system provides radio 
interoperability during incidents or events requiring communications between diverse organizations all using 
different radios and/or different frequencies. 
I look forward to building upon the strong relationships that already been developed with you and your col-
leagues during the first year of this very important program. 
Through our combined efforts, State and local emergency response agencies will receive the funding and as-
sistance they need to enhance their capabilities and prepare for an event that will hopefully never take place. 
Sincerely, 
Andrew T. Mitchell

1 INTRODUCTION TO 
ACU-1000/TRP-1000 HAND-
BOOK 
1.1 Preface 
This handbook is intended to provide prag-
matic information and practical steps on set-
up and operation of a multi-agency interop-
erability communications system using the 
highly adaptable ACU-1000 Modular Inter-
face/ Interconnect System (ACU-1000), and 
the TRP-1000 Transportable Radio Inter-
connect System (TRP-1000). 
Section 
Two, 
Introduction 
to 
Multiple 
Agency 
Interoperability, 
provides 
back-
ground on multiple agency interoperability 
communication along with basic information 
on the ACU/TRP-1000 Gateway Switch/ 
Interoperability Communications System, 
including a general overview of its opera-
tion. 
Section Three, Establishing an Interopera-
bility System, outlines the basic set-up and 
initial operating procedures of the ACU/ 
TRP-1000 Interoperability Communication 
System.  
Section Four, Technical and Tactical Con-
siderations, presents valuable insight and 
experience gained through a survey of ju-
risdictions that have had operational experi-
ence with the ACU/TRP-1000 Interoperabil-
ity Communications Systems. 
Section Five, Operating System Models, is 
provided to further assist users involved in 
setting up their own multi-agency interop-
erability communication system.  This sec-
tion presents descriptions of setup and de-
ployment by jurisdictions that are using the 
ACU/TRP-1000.  These system models 
demonstrate the potential for achieving a 
high performance system.  From these re-
views, new users will be better prepared to 
set-up and operate comprehensive systems 
that take full advantage of the capabilities of 
the ACU/TRP-1000. 
This handbook is designed to enhance a 
jurisdictionâ€™s ability to use the ACU/TRP-
1000 and to manage interoperability issues.  
The result will be an appreciation of how 
this system can deliver optimum, high per-
formance results for emergency response 
agencies. 
1.2 Grant Program Support 
The National Institute of Justice, a bureau in 
the Office of Justice Programs, conducted 
research into use of the JPS Communica-
tions, Inc., ACU/TRP-1000 systems in con-
junction with the Multiple Agency Radio In-
teroperability System (MARIS), under the 
Advanced Generation Interoperability for 
Law Enforcement, (AGILE) Program.  This 
program conducted a detailed multi-phased 
survey of all ACU/TRP-1000 systems 
shipped under the grant program.  Informa-
tion from this program is available online at: 
www.nij-agile.jhuapl.edu. 
1.3 Preferred Technical Capabili-
ties 
Individuals 
assigned 
to 
operate 
the 
ACU/TRP-1000 should possess, at a mini-
mum, the following requirements: 
1. Land mobile radio systems experi-
ence.  Experience should encom-
pass a good understanding of differ-
ent frequency bands, different types 
of modulation (example, AM, FM, 
HF APCO/digital), trunking systems. 
2. An understanding of radio theory 
such as receiver intermodulation in-
terference a plus. 
3. Some basic understanding of an-
tenna theory, wave propagation, 
feed line, RF connectors (PL-259f 
N/mini-UHF) is preferred. 
4. Basic knowledge of all the radios 
that may be interfaced with the sys-
tem. 
5. Ability to program a variety of radios 
during a situation as new groups en-
ter the network by referring to the 
ACLJ-1 000 manual. 
6. Technical degree or certificate pre-
ferred but not required, amateur ra-
dio experience a plus. 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 1-2 
7. PC experience working in a Win-
dowsâ„¢ 95, 98, 2000, NT, Ml envi-
ronment is a must. 
8. Experience in using phone patches 
and explaining to users on the 
phone that the radio is not full du-
plex like the telephone. 
9. Ability to run a console type of 
communications gear and be a sys-
tem operator is required. 
1.4 Acknowledgements 
In part, this handbook draws upon informa-
tion from the AGILE Program that was es-
tablished in 1998.  The AGILE Program, 
supported by multiple Interagency Agree-
ments 
including 
1999-IJ-CX-AO94 
and 
1000-LT-VX-A034, was awarded by the 
U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice 
Programs, and National Institute of Justice. 
Under this program, all of the interoperabil-
ity projects then under way in the U.S. De-
partment of Justice were combined by the 
National Institute of Justice.  The result was 
establishment of a three-pronged approach 
that addresses both short-term and interim 
interoperability solutions as well as long-
term interoperability solutions to be imple-
mented through standardization of wireless 
telecommunications and information tech-
nology applications. 
Some material presented in this handbook 
is taken from the National Institute of Jus-
tice, AGILE MARIS Program Study.  That 
research studied the feasibility for emer-
gency service agencies to utilize communi-
cations technology that was initially devel-
oped for the military.  That study evaluated 
the two interoperability electronic systems, 
the ACU-1000 Modular Inter-connect Sys-
tem, and the TRP-1000 Trans-portable Ra-
dio Interconnect System manufactured by 
JPS Communications, Inc. 
Any analysis, evaluation and review offered 
by this handbook does not represent prod-
uct approval or endorsement by the De-
partment of Justice; the National Institute of 
Justice, the Office for Domestic Prepared-
ness, or any other agencies who may be

handbook are those of the grant program 
participants.

2 INTRODUCTION TO 
MULTI-AGENCY INTEROP-
ERABILITY COMMUNICA-
TION 
2.1 Multi-Agency Interoperability 
Communication 
In its simplest terms, multi-agency interop-
erability communication is the ability of two 
or more public safety agencies to exchange 
information, when and where it is needed, 
even 
when 
different 
communica-
tion/information 
systems 
are
