User: Please introduce a horizontal expansion solution so that our website can handle higher visits and traffic.
Assistant: One horizontal scaling solution is to use a load balancer (Load Balancer). A load balancer can distribute traffic to multiple servers to balance the load, avoid overloading a single server, and improve website reliability and performance. The specific operation method is as follows: 1. Connect multiple servers to the load balancer, establish a cluster, and configure the IP address and port number of each server on the load balancer. 2. Configure load balancing policies on the load balancer, such as round robin, weighted round robin, IP hash, etc. The polling strategy refers to assigning requests to each server in turn; weighted polling sets the allocation weight according to the processing capacity of the server, and the server with the stronger ability gets more requests; IP hash is allocated according to the request IP address, This ensures that requests from the same client are sent to the same server to keep the state consistent. 3. In order to avoid service interruption caused by the failure of a single server, the health check function can also be configured. The load balancer will periodically send requests to each server to check whether its response is normal. If it is found to be abnormal, it will be removed from the cluster to ensure the stability of the entire service. Through the above solutions, the reliability and performance of the website can be improved to support higher visits and traffic. When you need to expand, you only need to add servers to the cluster, and then make corresponding configurations on the load balancer.
