User: I have two Python installations on my Windows 7 64bit workstation.  I have 32bit Python 2.7 and 64bit Python 2.7.  Each installation is required by specific applications.  I currently have only the 32bit Python installation in my system path.  However, I would like to add the 64bit version to the path as well.
Right now, if I type python into my Windows command prompt it will open Python 2.7 win32.  What I would like to be able to do is type python32 for the 32bit version or python64 for the 64bit version.
I realize I can rename each respective python.exe file as python32.exe and python64.exe, but this will break the hard coded paths that specific applications look for.  Is it possible to some how leave each python.exe named as python.exe but give it a different command from the command prompt?
Assistant: I use ixe013's junction approach.   The one issue I have had is that enthoughts enpkg installer doesn't "read" the symbolic junction...I have lost the details, but it broke the symbolic link and then claimed the installation directory was empty...
So if you are using ixe013s approach with enthought I recommend the following when updating
delete junction : junction -d c:\python
rename c:\python.2.7.32bits to c:\python
run enpkg
then go back:
rename  c:\python to c:\python.2.7.32bits 
junction -d c:\python & junction c:\python c:\python.2.7.32bits
