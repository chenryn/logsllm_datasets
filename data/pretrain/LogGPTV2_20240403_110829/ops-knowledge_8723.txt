User: I'm using PortableApps application with portable eclipse and portable python installed. I've equipped my eclipse with PyDev plugin enabling me to run and debug my files on whatever windows-based platform I'd like. The problem is in order to use the interpreter inside my USB stick, I need to address the proper location of the python interpreter in PyDev settings. with USB drive connected to different computers, I get different drive letter for my USB stick which would make problem locating the path of the installed python inside my USB stick.
Is there any way to enforce eclipse's PyDev plugin to look for python interpreter which is installed inside my USB permanently?!
Assistant: Have you considered giving the interpreter location as a relative path? For example:
..\..\..\python\python.exe. I am not sure what the working directory of PyDev is, but if you put enough .. in, Windows will stop at the drive root.
