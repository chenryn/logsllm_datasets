Certainly, here is a more polished and detailed version of your text:

I have an `npyscreen` program that provides a set of options. Additionally, I have a separate Python command-line program that interacts with the user by asking yes/no questions in a wizard-like manner.

I would like to integrate this command-line program into my `npyscreen` application so that when the user selects a specific option, the command-line program runs. I do not want to re-implement the entire command-line program within `npyscreen`.

Is there a way to achieve this?

I found a function called `npyscreen.CallSubShell`, but I couldn't find any example code or detailed documentation on how to use it.

Thank you in advance for any help.

**Response:**

`npyscreen` includes a function called `CallSubShell` which allows you to execute a command-line program. This function switches from curses mode to normal mode, executes the command using `os.system`, and then returns to curses mode once the command has finished executing.

Here are some key points to consider:

- **Standard Input Handling:** I was unable to get standard input (e.g., user input) to work properly within the command execution. You may need to handle this separately if your command-line program requires interactive input.
- **Screen Clearing:** It is often a good idea to clear the screen before calling `CallSubShell` to ensure a clean transition.

Here is a basic example of how you might use `CallSubShell`:

```python
import npyscreen

class MyForm(npyscreen.Form):
    def create(self):
        self.add(npyscreen.TitleText, name="Select Option:", value="")
        self.option = self.add(npyscreen.SelectOne, max_height=4, value=[0,], 
                               values=["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"], scroll_exit=True)

    def afterEditing(self):
        selected_option = self.option.value[0]
        if selected_option == 0:
            npyscreen.notify("Running command-line program...")
            npyscreen.CallSubShell(command="your_command_line_program.py")
        else:
            npyscreen.notify("Selected Option: {}".format(selected_option))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = npyscreen.NPSApp()
    form = MyForm(name="My Application")
    app.run(form)
```

In this example, when the user selects "Option 1," the `CallSubShell` function is called to run the specified command-line program.

If you encounter issues with standard input, you might need to modify your command-line program to accept input through other means, such as command-line arguments or configuration files.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Shan
