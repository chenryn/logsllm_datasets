### Detecting VoIP Vulnerabilities While You Sleep

#### Background on VoIP and Previous Research
- **VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)**: Uses the IP network to route voice data, either exclusively or in tandem with traditional phone networks.
- **Devices and Companies**: Involves a variety of devices from well-known companies such as Cisco, Nortel, and Avaya.
- **Adoption**: Steady adoption across the board, with approximately 50% of large businesses using it in some form by 2008.
- **Popularity Factors**:
  - Reduced costs (average 20% reduction)
  - Location independence
  - Independence from telecoms

#### Introduction to VoIPER
- **Overview**: VoIPER is a cross-platform, open-source VoIP fuzzing toolkit.
- **Features**:
  - Protocol-aware backend for managing SIP sessions and manipulating the device under test.
  - Extensive logging, target management, and crash recreation tools.
  - Automation capabilities with ~10 ready-to-run SIP and SDP fuzzers.

#### Description of Features
- **SIP and SDP Fuzzers**: Cover the majority of their RFCs and generate over 200,000 tests.
- **User-Friendly**: No protocol knowledge required; fire-and-forget operation.
- **Crash Detection and Reporting**: Detailed reporting and automatic crash recreation.
- **Target Management**: Start/restart the target device, minimizing monitoring and interaction.

#### Demos and Usage Examples
- **Example Header**:
  ```plaintext
  Content-Length: -1
  ```
  This caused a certain VoIP client to crash, highlighting the effectiveness of the fuzzer.

#### Testing Results
- **Initial Testing**: Focused on four VoIP clients: Ekiga, Gizmo5, Twinkle, and NCH Business Talk.
- **Bugs Found**:
  - Null pointer dereferences
  - Memory corruption
- **Single-Packet-o-Death Crash**: Detected in all tested devices.

#### Protocols and Standards
- **Common Protocols**:
  - SIP (Session Initiation Protocol): Sponsored by the IETF, open standard (RFC 3261), similar to HTTP, and widely used for command and control.
  - H.323: Dominant in the backbone of voice networks and large enterprise deployments.
  - RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol): Used for data transfer.
  - SDP (Session Description Protocol): Carries content in SIP requests and negotiates codecs.
  - Other protocols: H.225, H.245, MGCP, IAX2, Skype, STUN, RSVP, SS7, etc.

#### Security Concerns
- **Complex Operating Systems**: Functional TCP/IP stack, running various services.
- **Attack Vectors**:
  - Targeted C-level attacks
  - Botnets
  - Eavesdropping
  - Worms
  - DoS attacks on communications infrastructure
  - Other TCP/IP network attacks

#### Threat Mitigation
- **Attacking the Protocol Design**:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Encryption
- **Attacking the Protocol Implementation**:
  - Aim to find vulnerabilities leading to DoS or remote code execution.
  - Use tools like nmap, SIPVicious, and VoIPHopper.

#### Conclusion
- **VoIPER's Role**: A powerful tool for automated bug hunting in VoIP systems.
- **Future Work**: Encouragement to test the rest of the SIP protocol and other devices.
