# Implement a feature that split one window into multiple windows
Usually , when we start a terminal , and make a connection ,then the whole
connection will occupy the whole window, I hope we can split one window into
multiple ,then we can start connection in each sub window , then we can watch
multiple connection at the same time. cool.
Maybe a picture is much more clear to express what I want ,
