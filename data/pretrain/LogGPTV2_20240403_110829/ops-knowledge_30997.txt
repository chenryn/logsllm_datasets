Question: A cybersecurity analyst is reviewing the behavior of a newly discovered malware strain that has infected a corporate network. The malware is designed to search through the file system looking for financial documents and exfiltrate them. During the investigation, the analyst observes that the malware performs a recursive directory listing to find files with specific file extensions such as .xls, .docx, and .pdf, and copies them to a hidden folder before exfiltration. Based on this behavior, which file discovery method is the malware most likely using, and what could be the advantage of this approach?
"A": "Enumerating drive information to identify all available drives before searching for files, which may allow for a thorough search of all storage locations.",
"B": "Using a malicious DLL to search for files with specific keywords, which could potentially bypass some antivirus heuristic detections.",
"C": "Gathering a recursive directory listing to find files and directories of interest, which allows for a systematic search of the file system.",
"D": "Conducting word searches within documents on the host, which can be a more targeted approach but may require more processing time and resources."
Answer: C
