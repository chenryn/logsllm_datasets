Abstract
Interference has always been considered as an un-
avoidable peril in wireless networks. A single data
transmission is useful to some nodes and becomes in-
terference to others. Based on channel of origin, in-
terference can be categorized into co-channel (from
transmissions on the same channel as the receiver) and
adjacent-channel (transmissions on adjacent and overlap-
ping channels).
In this paper, we deﬁne speciﬁc mechanisms that can
transform partially overlapped channels into an advan-
tage, instead of a peril. We construct simple analyti-
cal and empirical models of such interference occurring
in IEEE 802.11 networks, and illustrate two scenarios
where such interference can be exploited. First, we apply
partially overlapping channels to improve spatial channel
re-use in Wireless LANs (WLANs). Second, we leverage
such channels to enable nodes with a single radio inter-
face to communicate more efﬁciently with their peers in
802.11 ad-hoc mode potentially using multi-hop paths.
We evaluate both capabilities through testbed measure-
ments.

Introduction
The IEEE 802.11 b/g standards operate in the unlicensed
ISM 2.4 Ghz spectrum which has 11 out of 14 chan-
nels available for use in the US. The channel number
(1 . . . 11) represents the center frequency on which the
radios operate (e.g. 2.412 Ghz for channel 1). The cen-
ter frequencies are separated by 5 MHz, while the chan-
nels have a spread of about 30 MHz around the center
frequency. As a result, a signal on any 802.11b chan-
nel overlaps with several adjacent channels, with the ex-
tent of overlap decreasing with increasing separation be-
tween the center frequencies. Attributing to this overlap,
a transmission on one channel becomes interference to
stations on an overlapping channel, also known as adja-
cent channel interference.
The term adjacent channel interference can be con-
trasted to co-channel interference which occurs from
transmissions on the same channel. In 802.11 and other
wireless networks, adjacent channel interference is con-
sidered a peril. In order to avoid this peril, two simul-
taneously communicating nodes that are in close prox-
imity are assigned to different non-overlapping chan-
nels, i.e., channels 1, 6, and 11 in 802.11b are non-
overlapping. For example, in a inbuilding WLAN with
multiple APs, interfering APs are assigned to different
non-overlapping channels. Traditionally, in the literature
on channel assignment algorithms, the notion of avail-
ability of a set of N channels has inherently implied
that they are non-overlapping. This is why the number
of available channels in 802.11b networks is considered
to be three. However, many channel pairs in the ISM
band overlap partially. Given that wireless spectrum is a
scarce resource, in this paper we discuss the basic con-
cepts behind building techniques to carefully exploit the
partially-overlapped nature of channels for efﬁcient spec-
trum management.
Consider a simple experiment where a transmitting
station is placed on channel 6, and a receiving station
is moved from channel 1 through 11. The two stations
are placed in close proximity to each other to preclude
effects of signal attenuation due to distance. Table 1
shows the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received sig-
nal on channels 1 . . . 11. The SNR is normalized to a
scale of 0 . . . 1 with 1 denoting the maximum signal re-
ceived and 0 the minimum (indicating background noise
level). We can see that the interference between chan-
nels 1 and 6, and channels 6 and 11 is minimum – hence
they are considered non-overlapping. However, there ex-
ist other channel pairs (eg:- h2, 6i and h6, 10i) where the
interference is fairly low.
We deﬁne a term Interference-factor or simply I-factor
denoted by I(i, j) as the extent of overlap between chan-
nels i and j. If Pi denotes the power received at a given
location of a particular signal, and Pj denote the power
received of the same signal at the same location on chan-
. I(i, j) gives the frac-
nel j, then I(i, j) is deﬁned as Pi
Pj
tion of a signal’s power on channel j that will be received
on channel i. Table 1 thus shows I(i, 6) normalized to a
scale of 0 . . . 1.
I-factor can be calculated analytically
as well as empirically and does not depend on the ra-
dio propagation properties of the environment (i.e. open
space or indoors). It depends on the extent of frequency
overlap between the signals on channels i and j.
We believe that ours is the ﬁrst systematic effort on
taking advantage of partial overlap among channels in
two different settings — WLANs and mesh networks.
Each scenario illustrates a novel conceptual notion of ex-

ploiting the overlap among channels. To achieve some
desired beneﬁts we will leverage the following two ob-
servations. 1) As shown in Table 1 partial overlap among
two channels reduces the signal strength of a transmis-
sion on one channel as received on the other (when com-
pared to using the same channel). This improves the spa-
tial re-use of channels which refers to how frequently a
single channel can be re-used without interference. 2)
Partially overlapped channels will allow communication
between two nodes operating on non-overlapped chan-
nels, by forwarding trafﬁc among them. We describe the
two settings next.
Figure 1: Two advantages of using partial overlapping
channels in wireless networks.
WLAN scenario: In a WLAN, an AP and its associ-
ated clients which form a basic service set (BSS), com-
municate on a single channel. Two APs can operate on
the same channel as long as they do not interfere with
each other. Better spatial re-use of channels brings about
improvement in the network’s throughput capacity as a
whole [9]. Speciﬁcally in a WLAN, this allows the place-
ment of more APs without interference and thus provid-
ing better service to an increased number of clients.
Neighboring APs in a WLAN are typically spaced suf-
ﬁciently far apart so as to maximize the region of cover-
age while allowing some overlap for handoffs to occur
smoothly. Figure 1(a) shows two APs and the interfer-
ence range of their BSS which is the distance upto which
transmission from the AP or an associated client would
interfere (circular ranges for illustration only). Here
these APs will have to be assigned to non-overlapping
channels, or the APs will have to be spaced further apart
to allow them to operate on the same channel. Instead
of assigning them to non-overlapping channels, one can
assign them partially overlapping channels such that the
signal attenuation due to the partial overlap makes the in-
terference negligible (i.e. the signal strength degrades to
a tolerable level). Conceptually, this can be thought of
as reduction in the interference range of an AP’s BSS as
viewed by a receiver on an adjacent overlapping channel.
The reduction in the interference range increases with in-
creased separation among the channels, with complete
reduction perceived over non-overlapping channels.
It may appear that similar reduction in BSS size can
be achieved by reducing transmission power of the APs.
Unfortunately such a change does not lead to the same
level of spectral use for two reasons. 1) Although by
reducing transmission powers in 802.11b networks APs
can be brought as close to each other as in the adjacent
channel case, the number of channels that can be utilized
is still three (and not four). 2) Reduction in transmission
power reduces the signal to noise ratio in the AP-client
interaction and adversely affects performance for clients.
Hence, by exploiting adjacent channel interference we
can get much better performance than by just reducing
transmission power at APs. We evaluate this effect over
TCP/UDP throughputs and MAC level collisions as mea-
sured in testbed environments in Section 3.
Mesh networks scenario: Consider a very simple mesh
network setting with three nodes each having just one ra-
dio interface (Figure 1(b)). In general, if node A wants
to communicate with node B, both these nodes need to
use the same channel. However, let us assume that due
to assignment of channels to other neighboring nodes, A
and B need to be assigned to channels 1 and 6 respec-
tively. However, if node C can be assigned to channel
4, then there are partial overlap between channels as-
signed to A and C as well as between B and C. Hence C
can route trafﬁc from A to B, using the partially overlap-
ping properties of channels. Such opportunistic mecha-
nisms can have non-trivial impact on the routing system
used by the mesh network.
In general, mesh network
nodes where the number of interfaces available is less
than the number of non-overlapping channels provided
by the physical layer (such as 12 in 802.11a) can utilize
such optimizations to communicate with nodes on multi-
ple channels providing increased ﬂexibility to the routing
infrastructure used by the network. We evaluate this us-
ing experiments in Section 4. Next section presents the
analytical basis behind spatial re-use.

for the discussion below.
For the simplicity of discussion, we will assume an
open-space environment, in which the path loss of a sig-
nal is usually modeled by a two-ray ground propagation
model [7]. Let d is the distance between the receiver
and the transmitter. According to this model, in the open
space environment, the received power Pr of a signal
from a sender at distance d is given by
Pr = PtGtGr
h2
t h2
r
dk
(1)
In Equation 1, Gt and Gr are the antenna gains of the
transmitter and the receiver respectively. ht and hr are
the height of both antennas. Pt is the transmission power
at the sender. The path loss, parameter k, typically is a
value between 2 and 4.
A signal arriving at a receiver can be demodulated cor-
rectly if the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) is above a certain
threshold (say TSN R). Say, a transmitter T and receiver
R are separated by distance d, while another sender S
(potentially causing interference) is at a distance r from
the receiver R and on the same channel. Let Pd denote
the receiving power of the signal from the transmitter T,
and Pr the power of the signal from S at R. Thus, the
SNR is given as SN R = Pd
, where Na is the am-
bient or thermal noise in the environment around the re-
ceiver R. For simplicity of analysis, we neglect Na com-
pared to Pr, and assume homogeneous radios. We have,
Pr+Na
SN R = Pd/Pr =(cid:18) r
(cid:19)k ≥ TSN R
r ≥ kpTSN R.d

Thus, to successfully receive a signal, the interfering
TSN R.d distance away from the
√
nodes must be at least k
receiver.
Now, if T and R were on channel i and the sender was
on channel j, the minimum separation between S and R
would become kpTSN RI(i, j).d, where I(i, j) denotes
k
the I-factor (see Table 1) as deﬁned in Section 1. Note
that since I(i, j) ≤ 1, this new distance is less than
√
TSN Rd, thus allowing the stations to get closer with-
out incurring interference. This improves the spatial re-
use of the wireless spectrum. We show how this concept
can improve channel assignment in WLANs next.
3 Channel Assignment in WLANs
Channel assignment to APs in a wireless LAN is typi-
cally performed statically by the network adiminstrators
after performing an RF site survey, or autonomously by
the APs performing a “least congested channel search
(LCCS)”, i.e., identifying a channel which has low in-
