User: I installed Anaconda a while ago but recently decided to uninstall it and just install basic python 2.7.
I removed Anaconda and deleted all the directories and installed python 2.7.
But when I go to install PyGTK for Windows it says it will install it to the c:/users/.../Anaconda directory - this doesn't even exist. I want to install it to the c:/python-2.7 directory. Why does it think Anaconda is still installed? And how can I change this?
Assistant: In the folder where you installed Anaconda (Example: C:\Users\username\Anaconda3) there should be an executable called Uninstall-Anaconda.exe. Double click on this file to start uninstall Anaconda.
That should do the trick as well.
