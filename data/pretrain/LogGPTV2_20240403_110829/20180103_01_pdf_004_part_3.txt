### Analyzing Data with Saiku Server

#### 4.1.1 Data Visualization
Saiku will open in the web browser you have selected (Chrome or Firefox) as specified in your Collect Earth properties.

To start querying and visualizing Collect Earth data, follow these steps:
1. Click the dropdown arrow under "Cubes" in the left-hand panel.
2. Select "Plot."

The full set of Collect Earth data fields will appear in the left panel, and the Saiku toolbar will be ready for use. Collect Earth data cubes are organized into folders. The folders listed under "Dimensions" contain data that the Collect Earth user has manually entered. Click a folder once to open or close it. To use data for a query, either click on the cube with the title that matches the folder name or drag it to the "Columns," "Rows," or "Filter" field.

The folders listed under "Measures" contain Collect Earth metadata, which the user has not entered (except for "Year of change data").

Elevation data (average, minimum, and maximum) is assigned to each plot after the grid is established and before the user enters land use data in Collect Earth. This data is derived from the United States Geological Survey Shuttle Radar Topography Mission dataset, available at a 90-meter spatial resolution.

Plot count is calculated in the database. The total includes plots with data that have been actively submitted and saved in Collect Earth, as well as plots with data that have been entered but not successfully submitted. For example, an incomplete form where the user has not entered all required data will be passively saved by Collect Earth. This data will be available in Saiku if no other data for the plot has already been actively submitted.

In the example below, there is a column for each land use category, and the number of plots assigned to each category in Collect Earth is listed in the first row of the table.

#### Sidebar Functions for Data Visualization
The side toolbar contains functions for quickly visualizing data in different formats. The default options when visualizing data in table mode include:
- Adding a spark bar at the end of each row,
- Adding a spark line,
- Calculating basic statistics.

Calculating basic statistics is useful when working with two or more data series. Add "Region" to the "Rows" field next to "Plot count." Notice that a row has been added for each region, and the number of plots for each land use category is listed by region. "Plot count" is always the default measurement. If any other cubes are placed in the "Rows" field, "Plot count" can be removed, and the values will remain the same.

In the example on the left, each land use category has a data series representing the distribution of plots throughout the various regions. Basic statistics are provided for each data series (column).

#### Chart Modes in Saiku
There are numerous options for viewing Saiku data in chart mode:
- Bar chart
- Stacked bar chart
- 100% Bar chart
- Multiple bar chart
- Line graph
- Area graph
- Heat grid
- Dot chart
- Waterfall chart
- Pie chart

Saiku charts are interactive. Hover over a chart to closely inspect any element.

#### 4.1.2 Filtering Data
There are several ways to filter data in Saiku. Data can be filtered before and during a query, as well as after running a query while viewing results in Saiku’s interactive tables and charts.

**Example: Number of Deforested Plots per Land Use Category**
Deforested plots are those that were initially forest but now belong to a different land use category. Start by selecting the non-forest land use categories:
1. Move the land use category cube to the "Columns" field.
2. Click on the filter icon (the magnifying glass).
3. Select the members (land use categories) you wish to use and move them to the column on the right. To select multiple members, hold the Control key.
4. Click OK to save the filter settings.

Drag the "Initial land use" cube to the filter field. The filter window will immediately pop up. Move "Initially Forest" to the column on the right and click OK to view the results.

You can also obtain the same results by filtering after running the query:
1. Remove all data cubes.
2. Add "Category" in the "Columns" field and "Initial Land Use" in the "Rows" field.
3. Click on "Initially Forest" and select "Keep Only."
4. Click on "Initially Forest" again and select "Remove Filter" to return to the original table.
5. Use the filter tool within the cube to remove the forest land use category. (With forest that has remained forest removed from the query, we can focus on deforestation.)

View the query results as a bar chart. Every item in the table can be selected, including the colored boxes and the data series names in the legend. Click on the blue box for forest in the legend to display only forest data. Re-render the chart. Click on the "Forest" data series title to remove forest data from the chart.

#### 4.1.3 Saving and Opening Queries
The main Saiku toolbar includes common functions such as saving and opening queries. To save a query, type the new file name and click "Save." When using Saiku Server in the default mode, saved queries will only be viewable by you. If you are connected to a common Saiku Server, saved queries will be viewable by everyone.

The window for opening queries is almost identical to the window for saving queries. Type keywords in the search field to filter the list of your queries. Then double-click on a query title to open it.

#### 4.1.4 Export Options
Charts can be exported in SVG, PNG, PDF, and JPEG formats (listed in order of file size, from small to large).

#### 4.1.5 Sample Queries for LULUCF Monitoring
- Plot counts by land use sub-category
- Land use category plot counts by province (table mode)
- Land use category plot counts by province (charts mode)
- Forest composition (pie chart)
- Forest composition (bar chart)
- Fire occurrence over time
- Composition of deforested land by region (table mode)
- Composition of deforested land by region (pie chart)
- Land use change classification uncertainty levels (table mode)
- Land use change uncertainty levels (pie chart)

### Processing Geospatial Data with QGIS

#### 5.1 Installation and Setup of QGIS
Visit the Open Source Geospatial Foundation website to download QGIS along with many supplementary packages. Download the OSGeo4W installer for 32-bit or 64-bit. While running the installer, select the "Express Install" option and choose the packages to install. Once the installation is complete, launch the program from the Start Menu.

#### 5.2 Exporting Vector Files to Google Earth and Google Earth Engine
It may be useful to refer to existing data while assessing current and historic land use. Vector files (points, lines, and polygons) can be converted from ESRI-compatible shapefiles and other formats to KMLs, which can be viewed in Google Earth or imported into Earth Engine via Google Fusion Tables.

1. Click on the vector icon in the left-hand panel to add a vector layer to your data frame in QGIS.
2. Right-click on the layer and select "Save As."
3. Select the KML format, which can be viewed in Google Earth while assessing land use with Collect Earth.

For guidance on viewing KML files in Google Earth Engine, see sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2.

#### 5.3 Exporting Raster Files to Google Earth
Raster data (with pixels) can also be imported into Google Earth to support land use assessment. See section 3.2.7 for guidance on importing maps and images without a spatial reference system directly into Google Earth as image overlays. For other types of raster data, QGIS and a plugin called GEarthViewer can convert rasters into Google Earth overlays through a simple process that retains their geographic positioning.

1. Click on the raster icon in the left-hand panel to add a raster layer to your data frame in QGIS.
2. Under the "Plugins" menu, click on "Manage and Install Plugins."
3. Search for and install the "GEarthViewer" plugin.
4. Click on the GEarthViewer icon in the toolbar and select GEarthViewer from the options below to export a snapshot of your QGIS data frame to Google Earth.

Everything visible in QGIS will be exported as one overlay. Although vector files can also be exported with this tool, importing vectors as KMLs enables more flexibility in visualization. The resolution of rasters will vary based on the scale of the QGIS data frame. A 30m resolution raster will be blurry when exported at a 1:25,000,000 scale.

#### 5.4 Creating a Sampling Grid for Collect Earth
The following section reviews the process for creating a grid in decimal degrees using South Africa as an example. Many countries use a coarse or medium-scale 1° x 1° or 0.05° x 0.05° grids. Where specific geographic areas (e.g., small administrative areas or land use strata) with relatively small spatial extents exist, a country may choose to stratify their sampling and apply a smaller grid in certain areas.

According to South Africa’s 2006 vegetation survey, natural forest areas occupy less than 2% of the total land area. In the section below, a fine-scale 0.01° x 0.01° grid is created for forest areas, which are underrepresented in South Africa’s coarser, wall-to-wall grid.

There are eight steps to creating a grid compatible with Collect Earth. For most versions of Collect Earth, administration boundary and elevation data are required inputs. Boundaries for a specific area of interest or land use strata can also be used.

The objective is to create a CSV file with six basic attributes required to use the file in Collect Earth: plot ID number, latitude, longitude, elevation, slope, and aspect. In Collect Earth South Africa, additional columns such as province name, biome code, biome type, forest type, forest group, and bioregion are also required. However, if these extra attributes are not available, the columns may be left blank.

#### 5.4.1 Identify the Spatial Extent for the Grid
Country boundaries and spatial data for lower administrative levels can be used to define the spatial extent for the grid. A global dataset of administrative boundaries is available on the GADM website (http://www.gadm.org/). Spatial data can be downloaded in shapefile, KMZ, and other formats.

More accurate spatial data may be available from official government agencies. Spatial data for South Africa is provided by the Municipal Demarcation Board.

1. Open the administrative boundary layer in QGIS.
2. Right-click on the layer and select "Properties."
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Metadata," the last option.
4. Check the spatial reference system of the layer. This will determine the units of measurement used for the grid.
5. This layer for South Africa is in WGS 84 datum with no projection specified. The grid created in WGS 84 will use decimal degrees as its unit of measurement.
6. Copy the spatial extent of the layer and paste it in Notepad.
7. Click "Cancel" to escape the metadata window. Explore the spatial extent in the map frame by moving the mouse over the layer and observing the changes in the coordinates at the bottom of the QGIS window.

x_min: [value]
x_max: [value]
y_min: [value]
y_max: [value]
```

Replace `[value]` with the actual coordinates.
