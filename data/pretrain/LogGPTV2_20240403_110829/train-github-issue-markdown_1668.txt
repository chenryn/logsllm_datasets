While 7494 and 906 both describe behaviors that might surprise, it seems to be
the ones expected.
However this really looks like a bug to me, if not, I'm really curious of an
explanation:
    >>> import torch
    >>> a = torch.arange(20)
    >>> a[1:].sub(a[:-1]) # Achieve the same thing as numpy.diff
    tensor([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
    >>> a[1:].sub_(a[:-1])
    tensor([ 1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  8,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1, 16,  2, 17])
