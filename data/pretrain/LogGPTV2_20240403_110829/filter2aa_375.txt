FreeCulture.org is a non-profit 
organization dedicated to promoting 
and facilitating student involvement in 
the free culture movement. Launched 
in April 2004 at Swarthmore College in 
Pennsylvania, 
FreeCulture.org 
has 
helped establish student groups at 
colleges and universities across the 
United States. Today, Free Culture 
groups exist at nine colleges, with 
more starting around the world. 
Founded 
by 
two 
Swarthmore 
students after suing voting-machine 
manufacturer Diebold in 2003 for 
abusing copyright law, FreeCulture.org 
takes its name from the book Free 
Culture 
by 
Stanford 
University 
professor 
Lawrence 
Lessig. 
FreeCulture.org is part of this growing 
movement, with roots in the free 
software 
community, 
free 
speech 
advocates, civil libertarians, media 
activists, and others. 
FreeCulture.org 
is 
non-partisan 
and run by the volunteer efforts of 
students 
themselves. 
Each 
Free 
Culture campus group is autonomous, 
and diverse in their interests. Groups 
with 
which 
FreeCulture.org 
has 
collaborated include the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation (EFF), Public 
Knowledge, Creative Commons, and 
Downhill Battle. 
We need your help. Your time, 
your comments, or your donation help 
keep us operating and able to help 
students organize to have a voice in 
their culture. 
Your ideas and advice help guide 
our decision. Please visit our Web site, 
or join our mailing lists, and help 
contribute to the discussion. 
Your effort as a volunteer is vital to 
our work. Can you help design and 
administer our Web site? Can you help 
develop free software tools? Can you 
help us research issues? Can you help 
us translate into other languages? 
Please visit our Web site and see how 
to lend a hand. 
We are always interested in new 
campus groups. If you’d like to start a 
group at your school, please ask us, 
and we’ll try to help get you started. 
Nice to meet you! 
Love, 
FreeCulture.org
