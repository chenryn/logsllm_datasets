Limiting trafﬁc source collection: We were required to select
only data sources that pose low risks to the hospital. More
importantly, we needed to ensure that private information of
the patients or hospital workers was not present in this case
study. Data coming from trafﬁc payloads, packet captures, or
protocols that may contain unencrypted information, such as
HTTP (containing usernames, passwords, or paths to ﬁles)
or P2P protocols, were forbidden as they had a high risk
of containing private information. Additionally, the hospital
deemed the collections of DHCP to carry a moderate risk
as this data can be used to track or deanonymize hospital
workers. Similar studies in the future must carefully identify
the potential risk of each trafﬁc type before collecting them
and must coordinate with the potentially impacted parties.
Ensuring undisrupted daily operations of the hospital: We
also needed to perform our case study in such a way that
the hospital’s daily operations would not be interrupted. For
example, active analysis or active probing of network-enabled
machines could have revealed a more thorough characterization
of hospital devices (e.g., determining the services running on
a device). However, adding probing trafﬁc to devices with
low resources could accidentally bring them down and thereby
hinder the hospital’s daily operations. As such, the legal team
deemed the use of network scanning tools such as nmap or
Nessus to have a high risk of interfering with daily operations
and thus were not used as data sources in our case study. Future
research in this area needs to be mindful of which devices can
be scanned without overloading them with extra trafﬁc.
Eventually, all parties agreed to a limited and purely
passive analysis of the network. The analysis focusing solely
on DNS and TLS/SSL trafﬁc could be conducted without
risking patient privacy or safety and would allow meaningful
characteristics to be extracted. For DNS, we only focus on the
IP address information returned and no other information such
as email routing or additional domain names that allow for
reverse IP lookups. This leaves an unknown amount of trafﬁc
unseen by our study, which could affect the results. However,
we consciously accept this limitation to preserve the privacy
and daily operation of the hospital.
These requirements give us access to signiﬁcant amounts
of data in a protected fashion. For instance, patient data such
as electronic medical records are unlikely to be captured
in this conﬁguration, nor are we capable of impacting the
availability of any device due to unexpected probing. However,
these requirements also create important limitations. Whereas
previous studies of networked environments are able to con-
duct in-depth analyses of speciﬁc machines or users [49], we
were not able to do so. While appropriate in the case of an
enterprise environment, our prioritization of privacy and safety
forbid such analyses. We attempted to compensate for these
limitations and mitigate threats to external validity by using
public sources of data [10], [19], [21], [35] to provide ground
truth for our observations.
After all requirements were met and agreed upon, data
collection started and was conducted by both the hospital staff
(i.e., hospital trafﬁc) and our team (i.e., OSINT information
to complement collected data). The hospital trafﬁc collection
process was handled entirely by the hospital. While letting us
set up the collection mechanism would allow us more freedom
in getting extra information, it is critical for the hospital to take
care of this step. This way any information shared with us
was pre-ﬁltered to meet their privacy requirements. However,
after seeing the exact ﬁelds that were being collected from the
monitoring tool, the hospital did not require extra pre-ﬁltering
steps. Additionally, since the data gathered would be purely
passive, we did not add extra trafﬁc load (e.g., active probing)
to hospital devices.
B. Disclosure of our Findings
In our community, it is standard practice for researchers
to notify the impacted/responsible parties of any issues found
during research. Besides the limitation posed by the legal
team and IRB, we also agreed with the hospital to report any
concerning ﬁndings to them in a timely fashion. Our agree-
ment with administrators entailed one-way communication in
the reporting of issues. Our responsibility was to report any
possible vulnerabilities, but it was up to the hospital staff to
take actions (without needing to report back to us). While this
limiting agreement was speciﬁc to our study, it was necessary
to establish a relationship built on trust so that we can perform
future research beyond this case study. Additionally, we agreed
3
to keep the identity of the hospital anonymous for conﬁden-
tiality. As such, to disseminate our analysis, we ﬁrst allowed
the hospital staff to look at our work and suggest ﬁxes where
needed. The report we present purposefully abstracts results in
a way that reveals the minimum amount of information about
the hospital while maintaining meaningful results. A similar
agreement could be made by other researchers that wish to
examine hospital security.
We believe that the careful design of our experiments,
the inclusion of legal and IT professionals from all parties,
and the strict requirement for limited passive techniques were
necessary for conducting a safe and ethical analysis of the
hospital. While our case study gives us an insight
into a
large healthcare ecosystem, generalizing the results to other
hospitals may constitute a threat
to population validity as
many unknown variables may have affects on the analysis
(e.g., size of the hospital, funding available). As we discuss
further in Section VII-B, arranging such study a requires the
collaboration of multiple administrations. However, we hope
that this work and the guidelines suggested can aid future
researchers in designing similar ethical experiments.
IV. METHODOLOGY
Our research focuses on performing a D-HAI analysis.
Before explaining our methodology, we ﬁrst need to distin-
guish medical devices from medical supporting devices. In the
context of our work, a medical device has direct contact with
the patient while they are inside the hospital (e.g., MRI ma-
chines, hospital beds). Conversely, medical supporting devices
aid in patient care but do not necessarily come in direct contact
with the patient (e.g., laptops, computer terminals, databases).
Both sets of devices are essential in the daily operations of a
hospital.
Prior research examined the security of speciﬁc medical
devices for possible vulnerabilities [25], [28], [29]. However,
while medical devices are connected to the network and may
be vulnerable, we found in our analysis that network admin-
istrators use multiple mitigation techniques to isolate these
devices. For example, the vast majority of medical devices
are locally connected to aggregation points. Access to such
aggregation points is extremely limited even from within the
network (e.g., limited VPN access to the aggregation points).
Additionally, much of the prior work has shown attacks on
medical devices happening on the ﬁrst-hop communication
(i.e., wireless channel) rather than communication in the net-
work. In other words, from the network’s perspective these
medical devices are mostly invisible2 to other devices inside
the network, let alone the wider Internet. As such, much of the
hospital’s exposure to malicious activities comes from medical
supporting devices, rather than medical devices themselves.
This observation is extremely important to note because it tells
us that while previous research in the medical device security
ﬁeld is important, it does not necessarily address the attack
surface that a hospital may present. This case study is meant
to complement previous literature in medical device security.
2There may be a few exceptions, such as MRI machines, that may require
an Internet connection for updates from the manufacturing company.

A. Hospital Trafﬁc
The modern hospital system we studied, which is represen-
tative of many modern hospital environments, is comprised of
a partnership between a hospital and an academic research
center (e.g., a university). Collaborating with academic re-
search centers allows for various research opportunities that
beneﬁt both sides. While access to electronic health records
(EHR) is limited in the academic research center and admin-
istration/security standards might differ between networks, we
decided to include trafﬁc from both networks in our study since
they have access to private health records. For the rest of the
paper (and for simplicity), we deﬁne hospital. to include both
the hospital itself and the academic research center that has
access to private data.
It is common for hospitals to offer public WiFi, but in
this is a different physical
several cases (including ours),
network than the ones used for medical and medical supporting
devices. As such, trafﬁc coming from the public network was
not analyzed as it would not be representative of the hospital’s
ecosystem
To analyze trafﬁc from all devices in the hospital network,
we partnered with an anonymous multi-campus, state-wide
hospital. Hospital IT staff deployed and conﬁgured the Bro
Network Security Monitor (version 2.5.2) [41] on our behalf.
Our instance aggregated data at a single point in the net-
work trunk that connects the hospital to their Internet service
provider (ISP) (shown in Figure 1). From this vantage point
within the network, we are able to see all ingress and egress
trafﬁc to the hospital network regardless of which campus
it originates from. We collected DNS requests, TLS/SSL
sessions and resumed handshakes, and X.509 certiﬁcates for
a period of six months, from January 1st to July 1st, 2018.
Trafﬁc was passively collected to avoid disturbing or probing
any devices in the network. Our monitor was placed in a
4
Internal RoutingExternal RoutingAggregation PointMedical DevicesMedical Supporting Deviceslocation allowing us to see trafﬁc from the hospital’s external
and internal IP addresses before being remapped by network
address translation (NAT) for outside use.
Throughout our collection period, we were in constant
communication with hospital administrators and reported any
anomalies or malicious activities we found. Unless explicitly
stated, all DNS analyses in the paper are evaluated using A
and AAAA requests.3 From this data, we are able to see both
medical and medical supporting devices.
B. Ground Truth
We also collected data from public sources in order to
compare the hospital’s trafﬁc to the rest of the Internet. Due
to the lack of prior data with which to compare our hospital
data, we establish a ground truth for benign DNS trafﬁc by
gathering the daily lists of the top one million domains from
Alexa [10] and OpenDNS [19]. Trafﬁc rankings found in
these lists are reﬂective of popularity by how many users
throughout the Internet have requested information about them.
Our assumption is that we can use the most popular domains
as a whitelisting source because user-generated trafﬁc would
tend to query suspicious websites less often than those found
in the top domain rankings. Additionally, we use both of
these lists to better understand how a hospital’s trafﬁc might
differ from Internet trafﬁc as a whole. We used the Alexa
top sites list because it is widely used for whitelisting [12],
[36] and provides a popularity ranking more sensitive to
effective second level domains (e2LDs) (e.g., example.com
and google.co.uk). By being sensitive to e2LDs,
the
Alexa top list represents the largest entities (e.g., service
providers) on the Internet accurately, making it
ideal for
rating certiﬁcates. The OpenDNS top one million list, in turn,
provides a more sensitive popularity ranking of e2LD’s sub-
domains (e.g., analytics.domain.com). This makes the
OpenDNS dataset a more accurate representation of the largest
services used on the Internet and is thus ideal for ranking our
DNS data. Our goal is to be conservative with our whitelisting
deﬁnition. As such, we used the top 100,000 domains (rather
than all sites) of OpenDNS as a way to whitelist trafﬁc found
in the DNS data.
Conversely, to create a ground truth list of malicious trafﬁc,
we crawled six different publicly available blacklists.4 While
no blacklist is complete, we believe that the combination of our
sources gives us a reasonable basis for classifying ill-intended
Internet trafﬁc. These data sources include domains that have
been tied to malware, phishing, or other trafﬁc thought to
be malicious. Combining these blacklists, however, engenders
some challenges. First, some blacklists contain false positives,
which can happen when reputable domains are reported for
various reasons (e.g., advertising) that are not necessary ill-
intended. Usually, if such requests get the reputable domain
added to the blacklist, it will only remain for a short time.
However, those domains would still appear in our dataset since
327.4% of the data had Null as its record type. We manually inspected the
data and concluded that these queries should have been labeled A or AAAA.
These records have been kept in the dataset used in this paper. Additionally,
while data can be encoded inside a DNS request, we observed no such activity
in regards to PII exposure.
4We collected data from Phishtank [6], Zeus Tracker [7], MalwareDo-
mains [4], Dshield [2], and OpenPhish [5].
we keep track of all added domains. To ﬁx this issue for
our analysis, we manually removed any domain that appeared
in our whitelist described above from the malicious trafﬁc
found in the blacklists. Additionally, DNS domains that belong
to content distribution networks (CDNs) are problematic for
these blacklists. CDNs will redirect trafﬁc to multiple sites
and will be added to the blacklists if a domain it serves is
used maliciously. Since we do not know if the domains used
by the CDN were malicious at the time of query, we removed
them from our analysis to be conservative with our results.
While we set a ground truth for DNS trafﬁc, we also need
to establish a baseline for the hospital’s TLS/SSL commu-
nications. As no such baseline exists, specially for hospital
networks, we collected weekly data from Censys [21], a plat-
form that scan the entire publicly accessible IPv4 address range
and collects information from various protocols. Over 97%
of TLS/SSL trafﬁc from the hospital goes to TCP port 443.
Accordingly, to get a control population for communications
and cipher usage, we speciﬁcally looked at trafﬁc scans to TCP
port 443 of Internet devices found on Censys.
Finally, we collected certiﬁcates from Certiﬁcate Trans-
parency (CT) logs [35]. These are public append-only logs that
keep track of all certiﬁcates presented to them. The logs are
constantly updated with new certiﬁcates, making them tamper-
