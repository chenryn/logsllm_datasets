### Risk Perception and Threats Associated with Short URLs

The survey participants generally considered the risk associated with short URLs to be moderate. However, a significant number of respondents—30 (approximately 33%)—perceived the risks as high, and 8% considered them very high (Fig. 6).

To delve deeper into the specific risks, participants were asked to identify potential threats linked to the use of short URLs. The results are illustrated in Figure 4, which ranks the perceived safety of using short URLs.

**Figure 6: Rating of Risks Perceived in Relation to the Use of Short URLs**

The majority of respondents highlighted phishing attacks as the most prevalent threat, with 38% indicating this as the primary concern. This was followed by spam, which 34% of the respondents identified as a significant risk, and malware attacks, which 27% of the respondents noted (Fig. 7).

Despite recognizing these key threats, 74% of the respondents still believed that their antivirus software was sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with short URLs. The remaining 26% suggested alternative solutions such as the use of virtual machines, Norton Safe Web [13], McAfee Site Advisor [12], Bitdefender TrafficLight [14], and Quttera URL Scanner [15] (Fig. 8).

### User Awareness and Protective Measures

The survey also explored user awareness of concrete cases involving abuses of URL shortening services. In two specific scenarios:
1. An observation from the Global Phishing Survey of semester 2 of 2013, which noted that approximately 51% of all malicious shortened URLs used for phishing were found at a single provider (i.e., tinyURL.com).
2. A 2009 incident where a URL shortening service (i.e., Cligs) was hacked, leading to 2 billion shortened URLs being redirected to a single web page.

In both scenarios, an overwhelming majority of users (90% in the first case and 84% in the second) were not aware of these specific instances of abuse. While knowledge of these situations is not a prerequisite for all internet users, including such examples in public awareness materials could help highlight the risks of short URLs.

### Preferred Protective Measures

The final question of the survey aimed to determine the preferred methods users would adopt to protect themselves from the risks associated with short URLs. The results showed that:
- 46% of participants preferred installing a Site Advisor software, likely due to its practicality and ease of use.
- 31% opted for installing a browser add-on to visualize complete URLs, although this solution is limited to specific browsers.
- 18% chose other measures, such as specialized web services for previewing the websites where shortened URLs redirect.

### Further Analysis

The questionnaire provided a baseline assessment of how internet users interact with shortened URLs and their perceptions of frequency of use, confidence, and awareness. Key findings include:
- **Frequency of Use:** Short URLs are rarely used while browsing, but their use is expanding to other services like normal web pages and emails, increasing the potential risks.
- **User Confidence:** There is a general awareness that accessing short URLs is not entirely safe. Users feel more confident using well-known shortening services (e.g., goo.gl, bit.ly, t.co, ow.ly, tinyurl.com). This suggests that these services should enhance their security measures.
- **User Awareness:** Most users perceive the risks of short URLs as moderate to high. Despite identifying key threats, 74% of respondents believe their antivirus software is sufficient. A small proportion of users take proactive steps by using additional security software.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In conclusion, there is a general awareness of the security risks associated with short URLs, but many users lack specific knowledge about real-world abuses. To improve awareness, prevention materials should be disseminated on platforms frequently used by the public, such as email clients, news services, and social networking sites.

Further surveys and analyses are ongoing, and we are using our knowledge map [16], [17] to extract and manage user perspectives on short URLs.
