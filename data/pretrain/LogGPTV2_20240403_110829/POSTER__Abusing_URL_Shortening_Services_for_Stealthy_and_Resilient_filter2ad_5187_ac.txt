considered the risk moderate, however an important number 
of participants — 30 (approximately 33%) found the risks as 
high and 8% considered the risk as very high (Fig. 6). 
Going into detail on the risks associated with short URLs, 
the subjects of the Survey were asked to identify the potential 
threats linked to the use of short URLs.

previewing the web sites where shortened URLs redirect with 
specialized web services before accessing them (Fig. 8). 
Fig. 7. Proportion of possible threats linked to short URLs. 
Although  the  survey  participants  have  identified  in  the 
previous  question  several  key  threats  to  IT  security  when 
accessing short URLs, the majority of subjects  — 74% still 
believe  that  their  Antivirus  software  is  sufficient  to  counter 
any  risks  associated  with  the  use  of  short  URLs.  The 
remaining 26% of the respondents provided solutions such as 
the use of virtual machines, Norton Safe Web software [13], 
McAfee  Site  Advisor  [12],  Bitdefender  TrafficLight  [14], 
Quttera URL Scanner [15]. The other questions in this group 
are  inter-related  in  the  sense  of  presenting  situations  to  the 
participants  to  the  survey,  which  are  representative  for 
abusing URL shortening services. 
The situations refer to: 
1)  An observation included in the Global Phishing Survey 
of  semester  2  of  2013  mentioning  that  approximately 
51%  of  all  of  the  malicious  shortened  URLs  used  for 
phishing  were 
found  at  a  single  provider  (i.e. 
tinyURL.com); 
2)  The account that in 2009 a URL shortening service (i.e. 
Cligs)  was  hacked  which  lead  to  2  billion  shortened 
URLs re-directed to a single web page. 
The conclusion is that an overwhelming majority of users, 
90% in the first situation and 84% in the second situation, are 
not  aware  of  concrete  cases  involving  abuses  of  URL 
shortening services. 
Although  knowledge  of 
is  not  a 
pre-requisite for all Internet users, such concrete examples of 
short URL abuse should be included in any material aimed at 
the general public reflecting the risks of short URLs. 
these  situations 
The final question  of  the  survey  attempts  to  establish  the 
preferred modalities of users to protect themselves from the 
risks associated to short URLs. 
The  majority  of  the  participants  to  the  survey  —  46% 
mentioned they would be more comfortable in installing a Site 
Advisor software, probably because this is the most practical 
solution  as  aside  from  installation  it  does  not  require 
additional measure to be taken by the user. 
The following option according to the respondents  to  the 
survey — 31% would be installing an Add-on in their browser 
to  allow  the  user  to  visualize  the  complete  URL  when 
"surfing"  the  Internet,  yet  this  solution  is  not  very  widely 
accepted since it can be limited to a specific Internet browser. 
The  third  option  chosen  by  the  subjects  —  18%  was 
Fig. 8. Proportion of protection measures considered measures considered 
suitable by users in order to avoid security threats. 
Given the answers provided, we can draw the conclusion 
that  users  prefer  to  have  a  solution  which  integrates  all 
security protection measures from short URLs in one piece of 
software  which  is  compatible  with  a  variety  of  Internet 
browsers. 
F.  Further Analysis 
The Questionnaire on the use of URL shortening services 
provides  a  baseline  assessment  as  to  how  Internet  users 
currently  interact  with  shortened  URLs  and  what  is  their 
perception on the frequency of use, user confidence and user 
awareness when utilizing short URLs. 
In terms of frequency of utilizing short URLs, these types 
of  URLs  are  apparently  rarely  used  while  browsing  the 
Internet. However there is an important development noticed 
in the areas where the short URLs are used, specifically that 
although  the  main  aim  of  short  URLs  was  to  counter 
restrictions  imposed  by  Social  Networking  sites,  the  use  of 
short URLs is propagating to other services on the Internet (i.e. 
normal  web-pages  and  e-mails)  which  means  a  higher 
coverage by short URLs and increased risks for users. 
In terms of user confidence, the Questionnaire proves that 
there is a general awareness by the users that accessing short 
URLs  is  not  perceived  as  a  completely  safe  action  when 
browsing the Internet. Users apparently feel more confident in 
using URLs from well-known shortening services (i.e. goo.gl, 
bit.ly, t.co, ow.ly, tinyurl.com ). This could be an indication 
for the URL shortening services with the highest number of 
accessed  links  to  step  up  their  measures  in  providing  safe 
URLs for their users. 
In  addition,  users  are  not  currently  very  concerned  about 
the  stability  and  lifetime  of  short  URLs,  however  they  do 
agree that these types of URLs are popular. This aspect would 
leave room for significant improvement in future awareness 
papers on short URLs to focus on the issue of stability (i.e. 
broken links etc.) as well  as  lifetime  (i.e.  availability  of  the 
short URL). 
In  terms  of  user  awareness,  the  survey  reveals  that  the 
majority of users still perceive the risks posed by short URLs 
as  moderate  followed  closely  by  another  category  of  users 
who  perceive  the  risks  as  high.  Although  the  Survey 
participants have identified several key threats to IT security 
(i.e.  phishing,  spam,  malware)  when  accessing  short  URLs, 
Journal of Advances in Computer Networks, Vol. 3, No. 3, September 2015218 
the majority of subjects - 74% still believe that their Antivirus 
software is sufficient to counter any risks associated with the 
use  of  short  URLs.  There  is  however  a  small  proportion  of 
users who are taking a proactive approach in avoiding risks of 
short URLs by installing different software applications such 
as  Norton  Safe  Web  software,  McAfee  Site  Advisor, 
Bitdefender  TrafficLight,  Quttera  URL  Scanner  or  an 
Antivirus software with Total Security (including web surfing, 
site advisor). 
to 
the  answers 
As  observed 
from  analyzing 
the 
Questionnaire,  an  overwhelming  majority  of  users  are  not 
aware of concrete cases involving abuses of URL shortening 
services.  Although  knowledge  of  these  situations  is  not  a 
pre-requisite for all Internet users, such concrete examples of 
short URL abuse should include in any material aimed at the 
general  public  reflecting  the  risks  of  short  URLs.  Another 
observation  based  on  the  user  awareness  section  of  the 
Questionnaire  is  that  when  it  comes  to  the  preferred 
modalities  of  users  to  protect  themselves  from  the  risks 
associated to short URLs, most of them are inclined to adopt a 
solution  which  integrates  all  security  protection  measures 
from short URLs in one piece of software which is compatible 
with  a  variety  of  Internet  browsers  (e.g.  a  Site  Advisor 
software). 
In addition, based on the General questions section of the 
Survey  we  can  draw  the  conclusion  that  opposite  to  the 
current tendency that awareness material on the risks of using 
short  URLs  is  usually  published  on  IT  security  sites,  such 
prevention material would yield better results if published on 
the  platforms  of  e-mail  clients,  news  services  and  social 
networking sites as these are the common areas of interest of 
users on the Internet. Based on the feedback received from the 
participants to the  Survey,  an  observation  can  be  made  that 
the  Questionnaire  can  prove  to  be  a  valuable  tool  for 
compiling prevention material aimed at users of short URLs. 
VI.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
As a final conclusion it can be pointed out that there is a 
general  awareness  that  the  use  of  short  URLs  is  associated 
with security risks while browsing the Internet. Furthermore 
there is a remote category of users who are taking additional 
measures to protect themselves against risks of short URLs. 
However the lack of user awareness on concrete threats (i.e. 
actual  cases  of  short  URL  abuse)  as  well  as  the  lack  of  a 
strategy  in  disseminating  prevention  material  on  platforms 
which are frequently used (i.e. e-mail clients, news services, 
social networking sites) can cause substantial problems in the 
future especially with the expansion of short URLs to other 
Internet services and platforms. 
More  surveys  are  being  carried  out.  We  are  moreover 
analyzing  and  extracting  knowledge  related  to  the  users’ 
perspective  on  using  short  URLs  and  handling  these 
knowledge with our knowledge map [16], [17].
