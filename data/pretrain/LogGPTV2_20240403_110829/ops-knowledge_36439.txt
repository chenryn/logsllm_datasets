User: I downloaded the QJson python library using brew install qjson.
What are the next steps I need to take in order to be able to work with it in PyCharm?
Assistant: As others mentioned already: It's not the best idea - at least not in general - to install python packages via your systems package manager. It's better to use pip (ideally in conjunction with virtualenvs).
Apart from that, it should be possible to use the package you installed using homebrew from pycharm / python in general. In pycharm you can switch between different interpreters (Settings / Project / Interpreter). You need to to choose the one you installed the package for with homebrew (e.g. the one in /usr/local/Cellar/python//..).
If you used brew link the currently active one should be symlinked to  /usr/local/bin/python.
