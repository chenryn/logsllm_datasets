I updated to latest version, the syntax highlight is only partially working
for ES6. Here is my jsconfig.json at the root of project:  
{  
"compilerOptions": {  
"target": "ES6",  
"module": "commonjs"  
}  
}
keywords such as "if", "return", "default" are colored correctly, but keywords
such as "let", "import" are not. I am using react with file extension as .js
