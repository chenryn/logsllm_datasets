ABSTRACT
The Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) was in-
troduced nearly 20 years ago as a mechanism for hosts to
automatically acquire IP addresses. While the protocol re-
mains the same, its usage has evolved, especially in the last
decade with the introduction of mobile devices and wire-
less local area networks.
In this paper we investigate the
impact that new types of wireless devices, such as smart-
phones, have on DHCP. We use two one-month long traces,
collected at a corporate and an educational network, and we
compare side-by-side DHCP usage patterns. We develop a
novel passive ﬁngerprinting technique based on DHCP mes-
sages to determine the device type and operating system.
We show that DHCP implementations vary among device
types and have an eﬀect on DHCP lease durations. To im-
prove network address utilization, without introducing any
protocol changes, we propose a new leasing strategy which
takes into account device types. This strategy, compared to
current approaches, improves the address utilization without
considerably increasing the DHCP overhead.

INTRODUCTION
The Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) [8]
enables devices to attach to networks without manual con-
ﬁguration. It does, however, require manual conﬁguration of
access policies at the DHCP servers. One of the most criti-
cal parameter of the DHCP server conﬁguration is the lease
duration, indicating how long a device can use an IP ad-
dress. Setting up proper DCHP lease values has been an art

rather than a science. Long lease times can lead to exhaus-
tion of the network address pool assigned for DHCP, while
short ones can result in increased broadcast traﬃc and un-
necessary activation of wireless interfaces by power limited
devices.
There have been few studies on the DHCP lease times
[7, 11], both of which were done before the onslaught of
smartphones in local area networks. Smartphones present
a challenge in correctly conﬁguring DHCP leases. A single
device may acquire multiple IP addresses during a day due to
its continuous attachment, in either asleep or active mode,
with the campus-wide wireless networks. For example, as
a student moves from one side of the campus to another,
her devices can re-associate with various campus subnets,
acquiring a diﬀerent address each time.
In this scenario,
setting DHCP lease times even as low as one hour may not
necessarily be enough to reduce network address utilization.
To further understand the impact of smartphone devices
on DHCP lease times, we analyze two one-month long packet
traces, collected from a corporate and an educational net-
work. We make the following contributions:
• We develop a novel device and operating system ﬁn-
gerprinting technique based on DHCP messages, which
signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy upon previous ﬁn-
gerprinting techniques that are based on HTTP user-
agent information [12].
• We show that DHCP message exchanges vary both
across device types (e.g., laptops, smartphones) and
across operating systems (e.g.,
iOS, Android, Win-
dows, Mac OS X, Linux), with each device type con-
tributing a diﬀerent amount of DHCP related traﬃc
and having a varying eﬀect on the network address
utilization.
• We propose a new DHCP leasing strategy that does
not require any protocol changes, and which takes ad-
vantage of the varying usage patterns per device type.
Using simulation results, driven by our traces, we show
that the new strategy, compared to current approaches,
improves the network address utilization sixfold with-
out considerably increasing DHCP overhead.
2. DHCP BACKGROUND
DHCP [8] enables automatic network conﬁguration of hosts
in TCP/IP networks, with a message exchange between hosts
and DHCP servers. A discover message is broadcasted to
locate available servers. The listening server replies with an
oﬀer, which contains the oﬀered IP address. The client gen-
erates a request (“selecting” state) asking for oﬀered param-

eters from one server and implicitly declining oﬀers from all
others. However, there are other occasions in which a client
issues a request message, such as conﬁrming correctness of
previously allocated address after, e.g., system reboot (“init-
reboot” state), or extending the lease on a particular network
address (“renewing” or “rebinding” state1).
The server responds to a request with either an acknowl-
edgment, if the request is granted, or a negative acknowledg-
ment, in the case where the parameters are incorrect or the
lease has expired. The acknowledgment contains the lease
time for which the network address will be valid, either as a
new lease, or as an update. The client may extend its lease
with subsequent request messages sent periodically after half
the lease period. For example, if the lease time is 14400 sec-
onds, and the client is still active after 7200 seconds, it can
generate a request message at that time to notify the server.
If the lease time expires, the server assumes that the device
has been disconnected from the network. The client can is-
sue an explicit release message, but this is not mandated by
the RFC.
Finally, an inform message is sent from the client to the
server to ask for local conﬁguration parameters. This only
happens when the client already has an externally conﬁgured
network address.
3. PACKET TRACE ANALYSIS
We capture packet traces from two large wireless local
area networks, one from a corporate oﬃce network and one
from an educational campus network. Table 1 summarizes
the two traces, including their static lease policies.
Using the traces, we analyze the two types of data. First,
we examine DHCP packets, in order to uniquely identify
devices using MAC addresses, classify them based on the
device type and the operating system, analyze network ad-
dress utilization and emulate diﬀerent lease policies. Second,
we capture TCP and UDP packets using Bro 2.0 [1] to create
summary log ﬁles for TCP and UDP ﬂows, which enables us
to determine the time periods in which devices are active.
3.1 Device Classiﬁcation
We classify device types and operating systems by apply-
ing an a-priori learning algorithm [5] to generate association
rules, using as input labels the following ﬁelds in the DHCP
packets:
• Host-Name: Some devices set their host-name to a
string that can identify the type of the device. For ex-
ample, many iOS smartphones have names that follow
the pattern of ‘*-iPhone’, where * usually corresponds
to a string related to the user.
1The RFC deﬁnes the “renewing” and “rebinding” as diﬀer-
ent states. Their only diﬀerence is the way they request a
lease extension, i.e., broadcast or multicast.

Table 2: Distribution of Devices in the Trace
• Vendor-Name: Some devices include in the vendor-
name a string that can uniquely identify their operat-
ing system. For example, most versions of Microsoft
Windows include the string ‘MSFT’[3].
• Parameter-Request: Some devices generate a unique
set and/or ordering of options that can be used for
identiﬁcation. For example, Android devices have the
following options: ‘1 121 33 3 6 28 51 58 59’.
• Organization Unique Identiﬁer : Using the IANA Eth-
ernet assignments [2], we determine the vendor of the
interface and then we identify if that vendor can be
directly mapped to a speciﬁc type of device.
To quantify the conﬁdence of the rules, we used standard
data mining metrics: Support supp(X) is deﬁned as the
portion of all devices that satisfy the rule x. Conﬁdence
conf (X ⇒ Y ) of an association rule X ⇒ Y is deﬁned as
supp(X ∩ Y )/supp(X), where supp(X ∩ Y ) is the support
of rule X ∧ Y , namely, the portion of all devices that satisfy
both rule X and Y . The rules that have high conﬁdence in at
least one direction (conf (X ⇒ Y ) and conf (Y ⇒ X)), and
are not contradictory, are broken into their corresponding
itemsets X and Y . Those rules are then used for potential
classiﬁcation. For example, [host-name contains ‘Android’]
⇒ [Parameter-Request-List contains ‘1 121 33 3 6 28 51 58
59’] happens with conﬁdence 100%. The reverse direction
[Parameter-Request-List contains ‘1 121 33 3 6 28 51 58 59’]
⇒ [host-name contains ‘Android’] happens with conﬁdence
82.35%, and the remaining 17.63% are related to a device
that neither has ’Android’ in the host name (e.g., when the
user has modiﬁed the default host-name) nor any other name
from another device type. Now a host-name that contains
‘Android’ or a Parameter-Request-List that contains ‘1 121
33 3 6 28 51 58 59’, can be used to classify Android devices.
In other words, we assume no ground-truth but quantify
every rule.
While we use an existing classiﬁcation approach, we are
unaware of any previous work that has used an unsupervised
learning algorithm, fed with DHCP data, in order to clas-
sify devices and operating systems. Previous wireless device
classiﬁcation approaches were based on information in the
HTTP user-agent header [12] and were able to classify up to
82% of devices. Table 2 shows the results of our approach
on the two collected traces, indicating that more than 97%
of the devices were classiﬁed.

3.2 Lease Time Analysis
Using the DHCP-based device classiﬁcation of the previ-
ous section, we analyse the DHCP request messages. Table 3
shows the acknowledged DHCP request messages2 for each
device type, as a percentage of the total requests, as well
as the absolute mean and median values. We observe dis-
tinct behavioral diﬀerences between the corporate and ed-
ucational network. In the corporate network, smartphones,
especially iOS devices, generate considerably more DHCP
requests on average as compared to laptops.
In contrast,
in the educational network all devices generate roughly the
same number of requests. Figure 1(a), which shows the cu-
mulative distribution of requests per device type, illustrates
this more clearly. This diﬀerence between the corporate and
educational network is due to the smaller lease time of the
educational network, forcing all devices to generate frequent
lease renewal requests, as shown by the larger number of
requests per device in that network.
To better understand the diﬀerences, we present the dis-

the educational network, with the exception of the iOS de-
vices, the majority of the DHCP requests are renewals. In
contrast, in the corporate network a considerably smaller
percentage of the requests are renewals. Given the small
number of renewal requests in the corporate network, other
types of requests become more prominent, revealing a num-
ber of distinctions between device types. For example, iOS
devices, and to a lesser extent Mac OS X devices, gener-
ate a large proportion of init-reboot requests. In contrast,
Android and BlackBerry devices generate mainly select re-
quests, meaning once they acquire a new address, they rarely
contact the DHCP server again.
This diﬀerence between Apple and other devices is at-
