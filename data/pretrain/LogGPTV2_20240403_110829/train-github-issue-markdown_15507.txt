Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
Part of our dependency tree:
    @client/root@2.3.5
    ├─┬ @client/PI:EMAIL
    │ └─┬ @client/app-files@1.8.8
    │   └─┬ pixel@0.0.4
    │     └─┬ pixel-util@0.0.2
    │       └── mime@1.6.0 
    ├── mime@2.2.0 
But importing `pixel` fails, because it actually ends up with `mime@2.2.0`
(which is incompatible).
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version, and Operating System.**
