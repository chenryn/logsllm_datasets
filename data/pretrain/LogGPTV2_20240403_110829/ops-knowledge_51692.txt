User: I was wondering whether or not it is considered a good style to call bash commands within a Python script using os.system(). I was also wondering whether or not it is safe to do so as well.
I know how to implement some of the functionality I need in Bash and in Python, but it is much simpler and more intuitive to implement it in Bash. However, I feel like it is very hackish to write os.system("bash code").
Specifically, I want to move all files that end with a certain extension to a directory.
In bash: *mv .ext /path/to/destination
In Python (Pseudocode):
 for file in directory:
    if file.endswith("ext"):
        move file to destination
In this case, what should I do?
Assistant: It's not idea, since it makes your script a lot less portable.  A native python script can run on any unix or windows machine that has the proper python libraries installed.  When you add shell commands into the mix, you break that, and suddenly are locked down to a much narrower subset.
Sometimes you don't have a choice, but if it's something as simple as that, writing the code natively in python would make a lot more sense, and also be faster to boot (since the python process won't have to spawn a new shell just to execute the one command).
