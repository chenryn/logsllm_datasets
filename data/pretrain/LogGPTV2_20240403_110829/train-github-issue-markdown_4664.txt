If you want to declare another AppKernel a more lightweight version that only
uses Doctrine\Bundle\DoctrineBundle\DoctrineBundle(), along with others of my
own, you must include Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\FrameworkBundle() because
annotation reader is declared in FrameworkBundle() but the classes for the
annotation reader are from Doctrine, and that is strange because the Symfony
Framework IMHO should have its own implementation(that implies duplicate code
in a way, but its independent). My question is why did you make this decision?
I don't see how Symfony will work without Doctrine, and IMHO its a very tight
coupling.
