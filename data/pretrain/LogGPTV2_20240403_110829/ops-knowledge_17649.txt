User:  How to achieve elastic expansion and contraction of cloud computing infrastructure?
Assistant: The elastic expansion and contraction of cloud computing infrastructure can be achieved through the following steps: 1. Automated monitoring: In order to ensure reliable expansion and contraction, an automatic monitoring system for application running status should be established to collect and monitor various indicators in real time. When the threshold for capacity expansion or contraction is reached, the corresponding capacity expansion or contraction mechanism should be automatically triggered. 2. Elastic expansion: When the application load is too high, more virtual machines or container instances can be automatically started on the cloud platform to meet higher load requirements. 3. Elastic scaling: When the load drops, some virtual machines or container instances can be automatically stopped or deleted to save resources and costs. 4. Load balancing: When elastically expanding and shrinking capacity, a load balancing mechanism should be considered to ensure that the application achieves an average load distribution among different nodes. 5. Automated scripts: Automated scripts can help cloud administrators quickly deploy, maintain, and manage cloud computing infrastructure. For example, automation scripts provided by the cloud platform can be used to automatically add, delete, configure and monitor virtual machines or container instances. 6. Cloud platform tools: Many cloud platforms provide a series of tools and APIs that can dynamically manage the elastic expansion and contraction process of cloud computing infrastructure while the application is running. For example, you can use the Dashboard or CLI client of the cloud platform to execute automatic scaling commands.
