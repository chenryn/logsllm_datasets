are actually existing addresses, which forces perpetrators to provide
existing addresses. Creating a new, counterfeit registrant account
for each new domain registration is costly, as also registrars have
captchas or similar measures in place to prevent automated account
creation.
Therefore, Premadoma’s use of registrant data as part of the
detection strategy is an important instrument, both to increase the
overall cost of sustaining large-scale malicious campaigns, as well as
to improve the detection accuracy of malicious domain registrations
and therefore lower the success rate of malicious registrations.
Ultimately, Premadoma aims to reduce the sustainability of running
large-scale campaigns.
1.1.2 Predicting malicious registrations. To establish this disincen-
tivization, Premadoma applies machine learning techniques to
predict at registration time whether or not the domain will be used
in cybercriminal operations, based on similarities in registrant data
and the reuse of facilitators.
By deploying Premadoma as part of a registry infrastructure,
predicted domains are prevented from being added to the registry’s
zone file, and the cybercriminal operations are preemptively ren-
dered harmless.
1.2 Contributions
Firstly, we propose and develop Premadoma, an operational so-
lution for DNS registries to predict malicious campaign domains
at registration time. The system uses a novel machine learning-
based strategy employing two complementary predictive models: a
reputation-based classification (Section 3) and a similarity-based
clustering (Section 4), using a total of 38 features, 33 of which we
believe are novel.
Secondly, we realistically evaluate the proposed prediction model’s
performance and adaptability by incorporating an 11-month testing
phase. We thereby address complex and domain-specific challenges,
such as coping with incomplete ground truth (Section 5).
Thirdly, we successfully deploy Premadoma in production for
a top ccTLD registry. The system contributed to the take down of
58,966 registrations in 2018 (Section 6).1
2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The goal of Premadoma is to reduce the number of large-scale
campaign registrations by increasing the cost for attackers. By
operating in the production environment of a registry, we are able
to prevent registrations from entering the zone file by predicting
their maliciousness. In this section, we present the overall machine
learning methodology that enables the system to make predictions
about incoming registrations.
2.1 Machine learning methodology
2.1.1 Data collection. Registry data. We obtained 14 months of
domain registration data from the .eu ccTLD registry, between
April 1, 2015 and May 31, 2016. For each of the 824,121 new domain
registrations, the following data fields were captured:
• Registration fields: domain name, registrar used, registration
time and name server information.
• Registrant contact fields: (company) name, email address,
phone and postal address.
Blacklist data. To determine whether or not a domain is used in
malicious activity, three public blacklists are queried on a daily
basis for 30 days, starting from the date of registration. We consult
Spamhaus DBL [20], SURBL [19] and Google’s Safe Browsing list [7].
As soon as a registration appears on one of these blacklists, we label
it as malicious. In other words, a registration is labelled as benign
by default and may receive an irreversible malicious label as time
progresses.
Data enrichment. For each of the name servers listed during reg-
istration, the corresponding IP address is looked up, and where
possible, matched to a geographical location [16]. Lastly, we pre-
calculate some derivative features related to the domain name,
including the lexical randomness score of the domain name, using
the probability of character transitions [18] based on previously
registered benign domains.
Prediction approach. We aim to detect malicious campaign reg-
istrations from two perspectives.
First, we focus on facilitators of malicious registrations: infras-
