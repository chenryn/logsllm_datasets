User: How to install and configure the Docker container environment on a Linux server to support mutual access and collaboration between multiple containers?
Assistant: Here are the steps to install and configure a Docker container environment on a Linux server: 1. Install Docker: On a Linux server, use the following commands to install Docker: ``` sudo apt update sudo apt install docker.io ``` 2. Start Docker Service: Use the following command to start the Docker service: ``` sudo systemctl start docker ``` 3. Enable Docker self-start: Use the following command to enable Docker self-start: ``` sudo systemctl enable docker ``` 4. Verify the Docker installation: Use the following command to verify whether Docker has been successfully installed: ``` docker --version ``` 5. Configure Docker network: In Docker, you can use the Bridge network to connect multiple containers. Create a new Bridge network using the following command: ``` docker network create mynetwork ``` 6. Start the container: Start the container using the following command: ``` docker run -itd --name mycontainer --network mynetwork myimage ``` Among them, `myimage` is the name of the image you want to start. 7. Attach the container: Use the following command to attach to the container: ``` docker attach mycontainer ``` where `mycontainer` is the name of the container you want to attach to. Through the above steps, the Docker container environment has been successfully installed and configured on a Linux server, supporting mutual access and collaboration between multiple containers.
