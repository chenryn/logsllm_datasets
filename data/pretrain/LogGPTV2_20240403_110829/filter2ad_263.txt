SHARPE is a well known package in the ﬁeld of relia-
bility and performability, used in universities as well as in
companies. A modeler who is familiar with many differ-
ent kinds of models, can easily choose models that best suit
a particular system and the kind of measure that is needed
at each stage of the design. It is also possible to use dif-
ferent kinds of models hierarchically for different physical
or abstract levels of the system and to use different kinds
of models to validate each other’s results. Steady-state and
transient computations are available in the tool. Figure 1
shows all the model types available in SHARPE and “X”
denotes the available measures.
The interested reader is referred to [1] for a detailed
description of the tool. Also the reader can ﬁnd more

Figure 1. Model types available in SHARPE
The abbreviations in the Figure 1 are: RBD for reliability
block diagram, GSPN for generalized stochastic Petri net,
MRGP for Markov regenerative process, PFQN for product
form queuing network and MPFQN for Multi-chain product
form queuing network.
New Computational Features:
Many important features have been recently added.
- Mean time to system failure and mean time to system
repair available for Markov chains and RBDs
- BDD algorithms available for FTs and RGs
- Breakdown of downtime by states for Markov chains, by
blocks for RBDs
- Steady-state computation of MRGP models
- Cost of downtimes computed for Markov chains
- Fast MTTF algorithm [3] available for Markov chains
- Mathematica used for some symbolic computations
New Usability Features:
- Graphical user interface available, written in Java
- Plots can be visualized through Excel
- Models can be saved as a jpeg ﬁle or an eps ﬁle
- Comparison of many variations of a model can be plotted
- Breakdown of downtime can be displayed as a piechart
(percentage by components)
Conclusion: We believe that SHARPE is a useful mod-
eler’s “toolchest” because it contains support for multiple
model types and provides ﬂexible mechanisms for combin-
ing results so that models can be used in hierarchical combi-
nations. SHARPE allows its users to construct and analyze
dependability, performance and performability models. It
gives users direct and complete access to the model types
without making any assumptions about an application do-
main, GUI is more domain speciﬁc, though.
