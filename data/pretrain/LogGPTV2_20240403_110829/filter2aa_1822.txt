Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture that 
decouples the network control and forwarding functions.
What’s SDN Like Today?
Who are using?
• More than 15 popular controllers.
• More than 3000 open source SDN projects.

Threat Model
We do NOT assume that hackers can have network access 
to SDN controllers or SDN applications
Control channel is well protected by SSL/TLS
Threat Model

Control channel is well protected by SSL/TLS
A compromised host[1] or switch[2]
[1] exploitable if the target network is configured with in-band control.
[2] Switches are vulnerable to multiple remote attacks (e.g., Buffer Overflow[CVE-2016-2074]).

Conclusions
The first attack that can remotely compromise SDN software stack to 
simultaneously cause multiple kinds of attack effects in SDN 
controllers.
The data-plane-based attack surface is actually significantly larger 
than what has been discovered.
Service-logic-free vulnerabilities in the controller could be exploited
in unexpected ways to conquer the difficulty brought in by pre-
defined protocol interactions.
