### Mishits and Latency Penalties

A mishit occurs when a Virtual Probe (VP) is directed to a site other than the one with the lowest latency. Table 1 shows the frequency of mishits for each root server and the corresponding penalties. Missing the nearest site often results in significant latency, with median RTTs of 40 ms or higher for all root servers. These latencies translate into substantial penalties, which are the differences between the latency cost of the mishit and the best possible choice (optimal hit).

- **C-Root:**
  - **Mishit Penalty (median):** 5 ms
  - **Reason:** C-Root's sites are well-connected and relatively close to each other, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Thus, missing the closest site often results in connecting to another site on the same continent, incurring minimal additional delay. 70% of C-Root mishits reach a site in the same continent as their optimal hit.

- **L-Root:**
  - **Mishit Penalty (median):** 24 ms
  - **Reason:** L-Root has many sites, increasing the likelihood of mishits. These mishits often result in connections to distant sites with global routing policies, leading to significantly higher latencies.

### Effects of Anycast Location on Latency and Observation Bias

It is well-established that no single location can provide equally low latency to the global Internet, which is a key motivation for using anycast by root servers. This section examines how the latency of anycast service is influenced more by site location than the number of sites and considers how to manage bias due to the location of VPs.

- **Eﬀects of Site Location:**
  - **Figure 4a:** Compares the RTT distribution of four subsets of C-Root’s U.S.-based sites to C-Root’s optimal. The subsets start with a single location in Los Angeles (LAX) and add sites moving eastward to New York (JFK). As each site is added, the distribution shifts left, improving performance. In all configurations, 80% of VPs experience relatively large latencies, ranging from 150 ms for LAX-only down to 75 ms for the four-site configuration. This trend reflects the speed-of-light limitations from European VPs to the U.S., with latency improving as sites closer to Europe are added.

- **Eﬀects of VP Location:**
  - **Bias Analysis:** The analysis in Figure 4a highlights the dominance of RIPE VPs in Europe, introducing a bias that skews quantitative results towards services with sites in Europe. However, this bias does not alter the qualitative conclusion that site location is the primary factor influencing latency. This bias is also present in measurement tools like DNSMON [31], and it is recognized that RIPE Atlas does not represent all global traffic [33].

- **Low Latency with Geographically Distributed Locations:**
  - **Figure 4b:** Compares the RTT distribution of four subsets of C-Root’s sites, mixing locations in the U.S. and Europe. Starting with a site in Paris (CDG), close to the majority of VPs in Europe, and adding sites in the U.S., the configuration achieves RTTs within 20% of the optimal. This demonstrates the effectiveness of geographically distributed sites in minimizing latency.

### Summary

The study shows that the latency of anycast services is more affected by the location of the sites than the number of sites. The use of geographically distributed sites can significantly reduce latency, even in the presence of VP location biases. The penalties for mishits vary, with C-Root showing the lowest penalties due to its well-connected and closely located sites, while L-Root experiences the highest penalties due to its numerous, globally distributed sites.
