on routing may be a condition of site deployment, but we wish to understand
the potential optimal absent such constraints.)
We deﬁne mishits as the cases when VPs are sent to sites other than the
lowest latency. Table 1 shows how often mishits occur for each measured letter.
Missing the nearest site often has a serious cost: the median RTT for VPs that
mishit is 40 ms or higher for all letters. These large latencies are reﬂected in large
penalties: the diﬀerence between latency cost of the mishit relative to the best
possible choice (i.e., optimal hit ignoring BGP). Table 1 shows the 25, 50 and
75th percentiles of the distribution of mishit penalties to all four letters.
Surprisingly, C-Root’s few sites also have the lowest penalty of mishitting
(median of 5 ms). We believe that this low penalty is because C’s site are well
connected and relatively close to each other (in the U.S. or Europe), so missing
the closest often results in ﬁnding another site on the same continent, incurring
little additional delay. In fact, 70% of all mishits for C-Root reached a site in
the same continent as their optimal hit. The opposite is seen for L-Root, which
shows the highest mishit penalty (median of 24 ms). L’s many sites give many
opportunities for mishit, and mishits incur much greater latency, often being
served by a distant site with a global routing policy. (Consequences of mishits
and diﬀerences in the distribution tail are discussed in Sect. 3.4.)

3.3 Eﬀects of Anycast Location on Latency and Observation Bias
It is well known that no single location can provide equally low latency to the
global Internet, one motivation for the use of anycast by root letters. We next
show that the latency of anycast service is aﬀected more by site location than the
absolute number of sites, and consider how to manage bias due to the location of
our VPs. For this study we draw locations from C Root to simulate artiﬁcial ser-
vices of diﬀerent sizes. We then estimate client latency assuming all VPs choose
their closest site (an optimistic assumption, but close, as shown in Sect. 3.2).
Eﬀects of Site Location: Figure 4a compares the RTT distribution of four
subsets of C-Root’s U.S.-based sites to C-Root’s optimal. The subsets begin on
the right using a single location in Los Angeles (LAX), then sites are added
going eastward until New York (JFK). As each site is added, the distribution
shifts to the left, improving performance. In all conﬁgurations, 80% of VPs see
relatively large latencies: from 150 ms for LAX-only down to 75 ms for the four-
site conﬁguration. This trend reﬂects speed-of-light from European VPs to the
U.S., with latency improving as sites closer to Europe are added.
Eﬀects of VP Location: The analysis in Fig. 4a shows our measurements are
dominated by the many RIPE VPs in Europe (Fig. 1), characterizing a bias that
weights our quantitative results to services with sites in Europe. However, this
bias in VP location does not change our qualitative conclusion that site location
dominates latency. In addition, this bias is reﬂected in measurement tools based
on RIPE Atlas, such as DNSMON [31], and others have recognized that RIPE
Atlas does not represent all global traﬃc [33].
Low latency with geographically distributed locations: While Fig. 4a
shows a pessimal selection of locations, we can minimize latency by selecting
geographically distant sites. Figure 4b again compares the RTT distribution of
four subsets of C-Root’s sites, but now mixing sites located in U.S. and in Europe.
We start with a site in Paris (CDG), close to the majority of our VPs in Europe,
and with a tail elsewhere in the world—this conﬁguration is within 20% of opti-
