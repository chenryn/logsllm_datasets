User: I am writing a web python application with tornado framework on a raspberry pi.
What i actually do is to connect to my raspberry with ssh. I am writing my source code with vi, on the raspberry.
What i want to do is to write source code on my development computer but i do not know how to synchronize (transfer) this source code to raspberry.
It is possible to do that with ftp for example but i will have to do something manual.
I am looking for a system where i can press F5 on my IDE and this IDE will transfer modified source files. Do you know how can i do that ?
Thanks
Assistant: I have done this before using bitbucket as a standard repository and it is not too bad. If you set up cron scripts to git pull it's almost like continuous integration.
