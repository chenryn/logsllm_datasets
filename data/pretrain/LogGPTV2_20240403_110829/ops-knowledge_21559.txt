I'm developing a web application using the Tornado framework on a Raspberry Pi. Currently, I connect to my Raspberry Pi via SSH and write my source code using `vi` directly on the device. However, I would like to write my code on my development computer and then synchronize (transfer) the source code to the Raspberry Pi.

While it is possible to use FTP for this purpose, that would require manual steps, which I'd prefer to avoid. Instead, I am looking for a solution where I can press F5 in my IDE, and it will automatically transfer any modified source files to the Raspberry Pi. 

Do you know how I can achieve this?

Thank you for your question. One effective way to achieve this is by using a version control system like Git, along with a continuous integration (CI) or continuous deployment (CD) setup. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to set this up:

1. **Set Up a Git Repository:**
   - Initialize a Git repository on your development machine.
   - Add your project files to the repository and commit them.
   - Push the repository to a remote service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

2. **Clone the Repository on the Raspberry Pi:**
   - SSH into your Raspberry Pi.
   - Clone the Git repository from the remote service to the Raspberry Pi.

3. **Automate Code Synchronization:**
   - Set up a post-commit hook or a CI/CD pipeline to automatically pull the latest changes from the remote repository to the Raspberry Pi whenever you push new changes.

4. **IDE Integration:**
   - Configure your IDE to push changes to the remote repository when you save or build your project. Most modern IDEs (like PyCharm, VSCode, or IntelliJ IDEA) have built-in support for Git and can be configured to do this automatically.

### Example Setup Using Git and a Cron Job

1. **Initialize and Push the Repository:**
   ```sh
   # On your development machine
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin <your-remote-repo-url>
   git push -u origin master
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository on the Raspberry Pi:**
   ```sh
   # On your Raspberry Pi
   ssh pi@raspberrypi
   cd /path/to/your/project
   git clone <your-remote-repo-url> .
   ```

3. **Set Up a Cron Job to Pull Changes:**
   - Edit the crontab file on the Raspberry Pi:
     ```sh
     crontab -e
     ```
   - Add a line to periodically pull the latest changes (e.g., every minute):
     ```sh
     * * * * * cd /path/to/your/project && git pull
     ```

### Alternative: Use an IDE with Remote Development Support

Some IDEs, like Visual Studio Code, offer extensions that allow you to edit and run code directly on a remote machine. For example, the "Remote - SSH" extension for VSCode lets you open a folder on a remote machine and work as if it were local.

By following these steps, you can set up a seamless workflow where pressing F5 in your IDE will trigger the necessary actions to update your code on the Raspberry Pi.
