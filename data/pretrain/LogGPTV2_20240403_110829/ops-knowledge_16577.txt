User: How to ensure the security of a system? Please list security threats, defense strategies, and monitoring technologies, and analyze their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: To ensure the security of the system, various measures need to be taken, including preventing security threats, strengthening monitoring and emergency response and so on. Below are some security threats, defense strategies, and monitoring techniques, along with their pros and cons. Security threats: 1. Trojan virus: Steal system information or spread viruses by implanting malicious codes. 2. DDoS attack: large-scale distributed denial of service attack, making the system unable to operate normally. 3. Data leakage: Through hacking or insider leakage, sensitive information in the system is leaked. Defense strategy: 1. Install anti-virus software: Install anti-virus software on all devices to improve system security. 2. Strengthen password policy: Change passwords regularly and use complex passwords to reduce the risk of passwords being cracked. 3. Strengthen access control: Control system access rights to prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing the system. 4. Deploy a firewall: the firewall can block malicious traffic and reduce the risk of the system being attacked. Monitoring technology: 1. Security log: records security events in the system to provide basis for monitoring and emergency response. 2. Intrusion Detection System (IDS): monitors network traffic in the system, detects and prevents threats in a timely manner. 3. Risk assessment: Regularly conduct risk assessments on the system to discover and resolve potential security risks. Advantages and disadvantages analysis: 1. Antivirus software can effectively prevent viruses, but cannot fully guarantee system security. 2. Strengthening the password policy can improve the security of the system, but other measures are still required to prevent password leakage and other situations. 3. Access control and firewalls can effectively limit malicious access and attacks, but they need to be properly configured and updated. 4. Security logs and IDS can detect and solve security problems in a timely manner, but professional management and analysis are required. 5. Risk assessment can find potential safety problems, but it needs to invest a lot of manpower, time and cost.
