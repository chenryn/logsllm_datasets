title:blackhat:us-22 Chasing Your Tail With a Raspberry Pi
For some people, trying to figure out if you're being followed is a matter of physical safety for themselves or others. In this talk, we'll discuss a methodology for using low cost, off the shelf parts and some adequate python code to help determine if you're being followed by analyzing wireless signals nearby.A friend of mine recently found themselves in this situation and came to me for assistance. When I searched for possible solutions, I wasn't shocked at how many tools there are to try to track people, but I was shocked at how few there are to try to help people figure out if they're being tracked. So I decided to make something to help.We'll cover methodology and best practices used by professional SIGINT teams including automatically creating an ignore list for friendly devices. We'll discuss challenges encountered during development and field testing including dealing with MAC address randomization. Finally, we'll release the code so anyone who wants to build their own easily can, likely with parts they already have laying around.
