of which depends on the obstacle distance. Another problem
is that the measurements repeat at approximately 100 ms
intervals. If the 300 µs counterfeit echo is blindly injected,
the probability of hitting the attack slot will be lower than
10% for an obstacle 2 meters away, and will only decrease
as the obstacle approaches.
Approach.
There is no way an attacker can transmit
counterfeit echoes earlier than the real ones by listening to
them, so relay attack is impossible for ultrasonic sensors.
Another solution is listening and inferring the next cycle
by calculating the delays, but neither will it work because
the 100 ms cycle time ﬂuctuates due to desired jittering or
to asynchronous cycles [18]. Our approach is injecting the
echoes with a smaller cycle time of several milliseconds. It
may cause unstable spoofed sensor readings, but guarantees
successful injection in the attack slot.
5.3.2
Results
As mentioned above, results of spooﬁng attack depend on
the timing of injection, as well as the length of counterfeit
echo and cycle time.
However, by trial and error we are
able to ﬁnd a set of parameters that can cause interesting
sensor outputs, such as abrupt change, steady oscillation
between near and far, and jitter around a certain reading,
as shown in Figure 4(b). In the vast remaining cases, the
sensor readings are just disturbed randomly. When there is
no obstacle in the detection range at all, spooﬁng attack can
cause the display of pseudo-obstacles.
5.4
Acoustic Quieting
Besides jamming attack, another way to hide something
from the sensors is to eliminate its noise and passive echoes.
This approach of Acoustic Quieting has been well researched
[4][5][14], and well developed for miliary submarines to stay
stealth[10][30]. Methods include silent running, hull coat-
ings that reduce active sonar response, and hydrodynamic
hull design that reduces noise and active sonar response. We
propose two similar methods of acoustic quieting for vehi-
cles.
Cloaking. Sound absorbing materials (e.g., plastic foam)
are hardly seen by the ultrasonic parking system. For per-
sons wearing absorbing cloths (e.g., woman with a fur-coat),
the system has a shorter detection range. Our initial idea
is to cover the obstacle with deadenings like sound absorb-
ing foam. The damping foam can eliminate a portion of the
returning echoes, hence reduce the detection range.
Acoustic Cancellation. Active Noise Control (ANC),
also known as noise cancellation, or Active Noise Reduction
(ANR), is a method for reducing unwanted sound by the ad-
dition of a second sound speciﬁcally designed to cancel the
ﬁrst [6]. Helicopter pilots rely on this technology to speak
on the radio; it can also been seen on many high-end head-
phones. Though originally designed for cancelling low fre-
quency noise, we believe this method can also be applied to
cancel ultrasound pulses from vehicular sensors, because the
frequency is ﬁxed and patterns are predictable. Note that
the cancelling pulse in Figure 5 is in reverse phase. We have
done preliminary experiments that proved the feasibility of
canceling ultrasound by minor phase and amplitude adjust-
ment.
We are not going into details here, but dedicated
high-speed hardware is deﬁnitely required for vehicular ul-
trasound cancellation.

ATTACKING MMW RADARS
RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) originates from
the military technology since the Second World War, and
has been bound to military applications for a long time.
The ﬁrst vehicle with Radar for adaptive cruise control was
made available until 1998. This technology boosted 5 years
later due to the development of automatic emergency brake
and lane changing assistance. Automotive radars have very
di↵erent requirements and solutions compared to military
applications, such as smaller distance, lower Doppler fre-
quency, high multitarget capability, small size, and signiﬁ-
cantly lower cost [9][22]. A Medium Range Radar (MRR) is
installed under the front bumper on Tesla Model S. It is the
underlying sensor support for many of the Autopilot func-
tions, e.g., front collision avoidance and traﬃc-aware cruise
control.
In this section, we will present our security research on the
Radar and Autopilot system in Tesla Model S. By using a
signal analyzer we were able to identify the frequency band,
modulation scheme, and waveform pattern of the Tesla Radar.
Then we tried to jam and spoof the radar system with elec-
tromagnetic waves in the same frequency band generated
by a signal generator.
Our results show that automotive
MMW Radar can su↵er from electromagnetic jamming and
spooﬁng. We will demonstrate the following:
• Jamming attack can make detected objects disappear
from the Autopilot system.
• Spooﬁng attack can alter the object distance.
6.1
System Model
Due to the complexity of Radar system, this paper will not
go into the details and mathematics, but rather present an
overview of the basic principles of Radar telecommunication
technology in layman’s terms.
Basic Principle.
Similar to ultrasonic sensors, Radar
works on the basic principle of emitting and receiving elec-
tromagnetic waves, and measure the time-of-ﬂight.
How-
ever, due to the way faster propagation speed of electro-
magnetic wave, methods used for ultrasonic sensors are no
longer possible. The emitted electromagnetic waves must be
given an identiﬁer for recognition and a time reference for
the measurement of time-of-ﬂight, the task of which is re-
ferred to as modulation. At the receiver side, demodulation
is required. The waveform can be described as a harmonic
wave function in a general form:
ut(t) = At · cos(2⇡f0t + '0)
(2)
Modulation is therefore possible with three variables: am-
plitude A, frequency f, and phase '.
Amplitude modu-
lation is basically pulse modulation, frequency modulation
includes Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Frequency Modu-
lated Shift Keying (FMSK), Frequency Modulated Continu-
ous Wave (FMCW), and Chirp Sequence Modulation. In the
scope of this paper, frequency modulation and FMCW es-
pecially are introduced as it is how our target Radar works.
Frequency Modulation. In frequency modulation, the
frequency f0 is varied as a function of time. Fugure 6 shows
the basic structure of FM radar.
The instantaneous fre-
quency is varied by a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)
which enables the desired modulation via a control loop
(e.g., phose-locked loop, PLL). The received signal is then
mixed3 with the signal currently being transmitted, ﬁltered,
sampled, and converted.
FMCW. Frequency modulated continuous wave is a fre-
quently used modulation for automotive radars. As shown
3The process of signal multiplication is described as mixing
in high-frequency technology.
By mixing it is possible to
measure the signal at much lower frequencies.
Figure 6: Block diagram of a bistatic Radar with
frequency modulation [31].
Figure 7: Spectral display of FMCW with a positive
ramp for an approaching object [31].
in Figure 7, the instantaneous frequency is continuously
changed in the form of a linear ramp. With known slope
m!, the measurement of time-of-ﬂight can be converted to
the measurement of di↵erence frequency fd, which is easier
by signal mixing. The relative speed can be further calcu-
lated from the Doppler shift. By means of additional ramps
with di↵erent slopes m!, the ambiguity of linear combina-
tion can be resolved for a small number of objects.
Doppler E↵ect. If an object moves relative to the Radar,
the reﬂected electromagnetic wave will undergo a frequency
shift, which is described as Doppler E↵ect. Accordingly, the
frequency shift can be used to measure the relative velocity.
Frequency Bands. There are currently four bands avail-
able for use in road traﬃc (24.0 − 24.25 GHz, 76 − 77 GHz,
and 77−81 GHz in addition to a UWB band of 21.65−26.65
GHz suitable for close range). The 76.5 GHz range, which
is exclusive for automotive Radar and available worldwide,
dominates at present. The 24 GHZ range has also claimed a
large share of the market, especially for medium-range and
close-range applications.
Attenuation. Atmospheric attenuation is below 1 dB/km
at 76.5 GHz, and therefore only 0.3 dB for the return path to
a target 150 m away. However, heavy rain with big raindrops
that achieve the magnitude of the wave length (3.9 mm) will
result in serious attenuation, and leads to signiﬁcant range
reduction. In addition, heavy rain results in an increased
interference level (clutter) and decreases the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), which will in turn reduce the detection range.

Signal Analysis
The Radar technology used on Tesla Model S is not pub-

nal analyzer, D is signal generator, E is frequency

plies.
licly known, but certain parameters and patterns of this
Radar sensor is necessary for our understanding and crafting
attacks. Instead of rearing down the front bumper and look-
ing for the manufacturer and model information (which we
could), we turned to a more straightforward and trustwor-
thy way — directly observing the spectrum and waveform.
However, seeing them for ourselves cannot be easily done.
6.2.1
Description
It is said that Bosch 76 – 77 GHz MRR Radar sensor is in-
stalled on Tesla. If 76 – 77 GHz band is used indeed, special
equipments that can reach this band is the only practical
way we can observe its waveform. Normal spectrum ana-
lyzers and signal generators can work at high frequencies
of several giga Hertz at most. As the maximum frequency
increases, they can get very pricy. Even the best signal ana-
lyzers and generators (like the ones we used) can only reach
40 – 50 GHz, frequency multipliers and mixers have to be
further attached to fulﬁl this purpose.
Equipments. The following equipments have been em-
ployed for signal analysis: Keysight N9040B UXA Signal
Analyzer (3 Hz – 50 GHz), DSOS804A High-Deﬁnition Os-
cilloscope, 89601B VSA Software, and VDI 100 GHz har-
monic mixer.
Mixer acts as the RF frontend and down-
converts the 77 GHz signal to a lower frequency that the
signal analyzer can process. An oscilloscope is attached to
the signal analyzer for better observation in the time do-
main. VSA software is used for further signal analysis.
Experiment Setup. Figure 8 shows the setup of radar
experiment.
To achieve higher receiving power for signal
analysis, we put the antenna 0.5 m away and on the same
horizonal level in line with the automotive Radar.4
After
switching to Drive gear, Radar on the Tesla is powered on,
which can be tell from the detection of a car (the equipments
in this case) in the middle of the dashboard.

signal is conﬁrmed to be around 76.65 GHz, which proves
that the automotive Radar on Tesla works within the 76 –
77 GHz band. After some discussion and manual correction,
we further determined the bandwidth (ramp height) to be
approximately 450 MHz. The modulation is FMCW with
slow chirp sequence of 5 ramps, which all seem to correspond
to the technical data of Bosch MRR4.
6.3
Jamming Attack
After knowing the waveform parameters, a straightfor-
ward idea of attack is jamming the sensor within the same
frequency band, i.e., 76 – 77 GHz.
6.3.1
Description
In normal functioning, the signal received must be suﬃ-
ciently higher than the electrical noise so that detection can
take place.
Depending on any other signal evaluation for
ﬂare suppression, the threshold is above the electrical noise
by a factor SNR threshold of approximately 6 – 10 dB [31].
Jamming signal can be considered by the system as strong
noise or false input, which will possibly cause lowered SNR
or computing errors, and therefore lead to radar system fail-
ure.
Jamming Waveform. There are many choices with the
jamming waveform. We came up with two approaches, one
is ﬁxed frequency at 76.65 GHz, and the other is sweeping
frequency within the 450 MHz bandwidth.
Equipments. Keysight N5193A UXG Agile Signal Gen-
erator (10 MHz – 40 GHz) and VDI WR10 frequency mul-
tiplier (75 – 110 GHz) are used together to generate electro-
magnetic waves at 77 GHz.
Experiment Setup. The setup is similar to Figure 8,
except that the distance between the equipment and car is
increased for evaluation.
6.3.2
Results
The results of jamming attack is very prominent. At ﬁrst
a car is detected by the Radar system and shown, when the
RF output (jamming) is turned on, the car disappears at
once. When it is turned o↵, the car can be detected again.
Moreover, we have found the attack to be more practical
when Tesla is in Autopilot mode by increased attack distance
and less angle restriction.
We assume this is because of
threshold changes for tracking objects in Autopilot mode.
Results are shown in Figure 9.
6.4
Spooﬁng Attack
By modulating signals the same way as the automotive
Radar, we were hoping for some spooﬁng results. Due to
the low ratio of working time over idle time, signal injection
at the precise time slot is very unlikely as we expected. Nev-
ertheless, by tuning ramp slope back and forth in a higher
value range on the signal generator, we happened to observe
periodic distance change displayed in the Tesla.
6.5
Relay Attack
A more delicate attack would be to relay the received sig-
nal at the harmonic mixer to the transmitter, and send back
to the Radar to emulate a farther ghost target.
Because
the relayed signal closely follows the authentic one, it could
be accepted with less suspicion, therefore making deception
easier. Unfortunately, we only had one horn antenna at the
time of experiments and wouldn’t be able to do so.
7.
ATTACKING CAMERAS
Data from radars, LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, GPS, and
many other sensors are not enough for safe automated driv-
ing, especially on highways and city streets where many rules
and regulations are applied. For an autonomous car sharing
traﬃc with human drivers, necessary information needs to
be acquired visually from road signs and lanes.
Onboard
camera system handles visual recognition of the surround-
ings in automated driving technology. Recognition includes
lane lines, traﬃc signs and lights, vehicles, and pedestrians.
After fusing data with other sensors, the driving behavior
and routes can be better and more safely planned. On Tesla
for example, a forward facing camera is used to recognise
lanes and road signs. Features based on this technology in-
clude automatic lane centering and changing, lane departure
warning, and speed limit display.
Cameras are passive light sensors. From our daily expe-
rience, they can be blinded or fooled in many ways.
To
validate the attack on vehicle cameras, we carried out blind-
ing attacks in di↵erent scenarios, observed and recorded the
camera output. This section will present the experiments
on blinding the vehicle camera with lights of di↵erent wave-
lengths generated by o↵-the-shelf, low-cost light sources.
Our major ﬁnding is:
• Automotive cameras do not provide enough noise re-
duction or protection, and thus can be blinded or per-
manently damaged by strong light, which will further
lead to failure of camera-based functionalities.
7.1
System Model
As shown in Figure 10, cameras collect optical data by
CCD/CMOS devices through ﬁlters, generate images in the
camera module, and send them to the MCU for further pro-
cessing and calculation. The recognition results will be sent
to the ADAS ECU from the CAN bus.
