### 4.2 Obstacle Distance and Injection Timing

The success of the spoofing attack depends on the distance to the obstacle. Another challenge is that the measurements are repeated at approximately 100 ms intervals. If a 300 µs counterfeit echo is blindly injected, the probability of hitting the attack slot will be less than 10% for an obstacle 2 meters away, and this probability decreases as the obstacle approaches.

#### Approach

An attacker cannot transmit counterfeit echoes earlier than the real ones by merely listening to them, making a relay attack impossible for ultrasonic sensors. Another potential solution is to listen and infer the next cycle by calculating the delays. However, this approach is also ineffective because the 100 ms cycle time fluctuates due to intentional jitter or asynchronous cycles [18]. Our proposed approach involves injecting echoes with a smaller cycle time of several milliseconds. This may cause unstable spoofed sensor readings, but it ensures successful injection into the attack slot.

### 4.3 Results

As mentioned, the results of the spoofing attack depend on the timing of the injection, the length of the counterfeit echo, and the cycle time. Through trial and error, we have identified a set of parameters that can produce interesting sensor outputs, such as abrupt changes, steady oscillations between near and far, and jitter around a specific reading, as shown in Figure 4(b). In most other cases, the sensor readings are disturbed randomly. When there is no obstacle within the detection range, the spoofing attack can create the illusion of pseudo-obstacles.

### 4.4 Acoustic Quieting

In addition to jamming attacks, another method to hide objects from sensors is to eliminate their noise and passive echoes. The concept of acoustic quieting has been well-researched [4][5][14] and is extensively used in military submarines for stealth [10][30]. Techniques include silent running, hull coatings that reduce active sonar response, and hydrodynamic hull design that minimizes noise and active sonar response. We propose two similar methods for vehicles:

- **Cloaking**: Sound-absorbing materials, such as plastic foam, are nearly invisible to ultrasonic parking systems. For individuals wearing sound-absorbing clothing (e.g., a fur coat), the system's detection range is reduced. Our initial idea is to cover the obstacle with damping foam, which can eliminate a portion of the returning echoes, thus reducing the detection range.
  
- **Acoustic Cancellation**: Active Noise Control (ANC), also known as noise cancellation or Active Noise Reduction (ANR), is a method for reducing unwanted sound by adding a second sound specifically designed to cancel the first [6]. This technology is used by helicopter pilots for radio communication and in high-end headphones. Although originally designed for low-frequency noise, we believe it can also be applied to cancel ultrasound pulses from vehicular sensors, given the fixed frequency and predictable patterns. Note that the cancelling pulse in Figure 5 is in reverse phase. Preliminary experiments have confirmed the feasibility of canceling ultrasound with minor phase and amplitude adjustments. Dedicated high-speed hardware is required for effective vehicular ultrasound cancellation.

### 5. Attacking MMW Radars

**RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging)** originated from military technology during World War II and was primarily used in military applications for many years. The first vehicle with radar for adaptive cruise control was introduced in 1998. The development of automatic emergency braking and lane-changing assistance further advanced automotive radars. These radars have different requirements and solutions compared to military applications, such as smaller distances, lower Doppler frequencies, high multitarget capability, small size, and significantly lower cost [9][22]. A Medium Range Radar (MRR) is installed under the front bumper of the Tesla Model S, supporting various Autopilot functions like front collision avoidance and traffic-aware cruise control.

In this section, we present our security research on the radar and Autopilot system in the Tesla Model S. Using a signal analyzer, we identified the frequency band, modulation scheme, and waveform pattern of the Tesla Radar. We then attempted to jam and spoof the radar system using electromagnetic waves generated by a signal generator in the same frequency band. Our results show that automotive MMW Radars are vulnerable to electromagnetic jamming and spoofing. Specifically, we demonstrate:

- **Jamming Attack**: Can make detected objects disappear from the Autopilot system.
- **Spoofing Attack**: Can alter the perceived object distance.

### 5.1 System Model

Due to the complexity of radar systems, this paper provides an overview of the basic principles of radar telecommunication technology in layman’s terms.

#### Basic Principle

Similar to ultrasonic sensors, radar operates by emitting and receiving electromagnetic waves and measuring the time-of-flight. However, the much faster propagation speed of electromagnetic waves requires the emitted waves to be modulated for recognition and time reference. At the receiver side, demodulation is necessary. The waveform can be described as a harmonic wave function:

\[ u_t(t) = A_t \cdot \cos(2\pi f_0 t + \phi_0) \]

Modulation can be achieved with three variables: amplitude \(A\), frequency \(f\), and phase \(\phi\). Amplitude modulation is essentially pulse modulation, while frequency modulation includes Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Frequency Modulated Shift Keying (FMSK), Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW), and Chirp Sequence Modulation. In this paper, we focus on FMCW, which is used in our target radar.

- **Frequency Modulation**: The frequency \(f_0\) is varied as a function of time. Figure 6 shows the basic structure of an FM radar. The instantaneous frequency is varied by a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) via a control loop (e.g., phase-locked loop, PLL). The received signal is mixed with the transmitted signal, filtered, sampled, and converted.
  
- **FMCW**: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave is a common modulation for automotive radars. As shown in Figure 7, the instantaneous frequency is continuously changed in the form of a linear ramp. With a known slope \(m_\omega\), the time-of-flight measurement is converted to the difference frequency \(f_d\), which is easier to measure through signal mixing. The relative speed can be calculated from the Doppler shift. Additional ramps with different slopes resolve the ambiguity for a small number of objects.

- **Doppler Effect**: If an object moves relative to the radar, the reflected electromagnetic wave undergoes a frequency shift, known as the Doppler effect. This frequency shift can be used to measure the relative velocity.

- **Frequency Bands**: There are four bands available for road traffic (24.0 - 24.25 GHz, 76 - 77 GHz, and 77 - 81 GHz, plus a UWB band of 21.65 - 26.65 GHz for close range). The 76.5 GHz range, exclusive for automotive radar, is widely used. The 24 GHz range is also popular for medium-range and close-range applications.

- **Attenuation**: Atmospheric attenuation is below 1 dB/km at 76.5 GHz, resulting in only 0.3 dB for the return path to a target 150 m away. Heavy rain with large raindrops can cause significant attenuation and increased interference, reducing the detection range.

### 5.2 Signal Analysis

The radar technology used in the Tesla Model S is not publicly known, but certain parameters and patterns are necessary for understanding and crafting attacks. Instead of disassembling the front bumper, we observed the spectrum and waveform directly.

#### Description

It is reported that the Bosch 76 - 77 GHz MRR radar sensor is installed on the Tesla. Special equipment capable of reaching this frequency band is required to observe the waveform. Normal spectrum analyzers and signal generators can work up to several gigahertz, but higher frequencies require specialized and expensive equipment. We used a Keysight N9040B UXA Signal Analyzer (3 Hz - 50 GHz), DSOS804A High-Definition Oscilloscope, 89601B VSA Software, and VDI 100 GHz harmonic mixer. The mixer down-converts the 77 GHz signal to a lower frequency that the signal analyzer can process. An oscilloscope is attached for better observation in the time domain.

#### Experiment Setup

Figure 8 shows the setup for the radar experiment. To achieve higher receiving power, the antenna was placed 0.5 m away and on the same horizontal level as the automotive radar. After switching to Drive gear, the radar on the Tesla is powered on, indicated by the detection of a car (the equipment) on the dashboard.

#### Results

From the signal analyzer, the center frequency of the radar signal is confirmed to be around 76.65 GHz, confirming that the automotive radar on the Tesla works within the 76 - 77 GHz band. The bandwidth (ramp height) is approximately 450 MHz, and the modulation is FMCW with a slow chirp sequence of 5 ramps, consistent with the technical data of the Bosch MRR4.

### 5.3 Jamming Attack

After determining the waveform parameters, a straightforward attack is to jam the sensor within the same frequency band (76 - 77 GHz).

#### Description

In normal operation, the received signal must be sufficiently higher than the electrical noise for detection. The threshold is typically above the electrical noise by a factor of 6 - 10 dB [31]. Jamming signals can be interpreted as strong noise or false input, leading to reduced SNR or computing errors, and ultimately, radar system failure.

#### Jamming Waveform

We tested two jamming waveforms: a fixed frequency at 76.65 GHz and a sweeping frequency within the 450 MHz bandwidth. We used a Keysight N5193A UXG Agile Signal Generator (10 MHz - 40 GHz) and a VDI WR10 frequency multiplier (75 - 110 GHz) to generate 77 GHz electromagnetic waves.

#### Experiment Setup

The setup is similar to Figure 8, with the distance between the equipment and the car increased for evaluation.

#### Results

The jamming attack results were prominent. Initially, a car was detected by the radar system and displayed. When the RF output (jamming) was turned on, the car disappeared immediately. Turning off the jamming allowed the car to be detected again. The attack was more effective when the Tesla was in Autopilot mode, with increased attack distance and less angle restriction, likely due to threshold changes for tracking objects in Autopilot mode. Results are shown in Figure 9.

### 5.4 Spoofing Attack

By modulating signals similarly to the automotive radar, we aimed to achieve spoofing. Due to the low ratio of working time over idle time, precise signal injection is unlikely. However, by tuning the ramp slope back and forth in a higher value range on the signal generator, we observed periodic distance changes displayed in the Tesla.

### 5.5 Relay Attack

A more sophisticated attack would involve relaying the received signal at the harmonic mixer to the transmitter and sending it back to the radar to emulate a farther ghost target. Since the relayed signal closely follows the authentic one, it could be accepted with less suspicion, making deception easier. Unfortunately, we only had one horn antenna at the time of the experiments and could not perform this attack.

### 6. Attacking Cameras

Data from radars, LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, GPS, and other sensors are insufficient for safe automated driving, especially on highways and city streets where many rules and regulations apply. For an autonomous car sharing traffic with human drivers, visual information from road signs and lanes is essential. Onboard camera systems handle visual recognition of the surroundings, including lane lines, traffic signs and lights, vehicles, and pedestrians. Data fusion with other sensors enables better and safer planning of driving behavior and routes. For example, the forward-facing camera on a Tesla recognizes lanes and road signs, supporting features like automatic lane centering and changing, lane departure warning, and speed limit display.

Cameras are passive light sensors and can be blinded or fooled in various ways. To validate the attack on vehicle cameras, we conducted blinding attacks in different scenarios, observing and recording the camera output. Our major findings are:

- **Blinding Attack**: Automotive cameras lack sufficient noise reduction or protection and can be blinded or permanently damaged by strong light, leading to the failure of camera-based functionalities.

### 6.1 System Model

As shown in Figure 10, cameras collect optical data using CCD/CMOS devices through filters, generate images in the camera module, and send them to the MCU for processing and calculation. The recognition results are sent to the ADAS ECU via the CAN bus. The ADAS processor makes driving decisions and sends commands to actuators, such as the hydraulic steering wheel and control panel.
