on defenders but serves as a coordinator that facilitates
the mechanism-based game between the defenders and
incentivizes
the optimal behavior of each defender by
assessing a tax tk (via creating the tax scheme upfront).
B. The VCG Mechanism
The second mechanism that we consider here is the VCG
mechanism [36], [53], also commonly known as the Pivotal
Mechanism. This is a family of mechanisms in which the
central planner incentivizes users (defenders) to reveal their
true preferences in dominant strategies through the appropriate
design of taxes for users with quasi-linear utilities (or costs).
This leads to achieving the socially optimal solution. In this
mechanism, each defender Dk receives a monetary transfer
equal to the amount he contributes to the rest of the society.
This ingenious, but simple, idea leads to aligning the incentives
of all players with the social cost.
VCG Mechanism Explanation: Let x∗
−k denote the
equilibrium (by all defenders except Dk) under exit of user
Dk (i.e., assuming Dk is not spending anything on defense),
which is given by
x∗
−k = argmin
(cid:88)
Cj(x).
(11)
1T x≤(cid:80)
x⪰0;
j̸=k Bj
j̸=k
Let x represents a PNE investment vector by all defenders
(including defender Dk). Thus, the taxes paid by Dk in the
VCG mechanism under x for our interdependent security
games are given by
(cid:88)
j̸=k
Cj(x) −(cid:88)
j̸=k
t∗
k =
Cj(x∗
−k).
(12)
Interpretation of the VCG mechanism: Intuitively, each
defender receives a monetary transfer which is equivalent to
her “contribution” to the rest of the society. For instance, if the
defender Dk’s investments makes the system worse, i.e., the
social cost (without counting defender Dk) under the social
optimal (including defender Dk’s investments) is higher than
the social cost without including her in the system, then the tax
amount t∗
k would be positive. In other words, the mechanism
penalizes the defender Dk for worsening the system. On the
other hand, if defender Dk’s investments makes the system
better (i.e., with less social cost), tk would be negative (i.e.,
Dk would receive such amount as a reward).
We now characterize the weak budget balance constraint and
different amount of taxes paid by defenders under the VCG
mechanism in our interdependent security games, respectively.
Proposition 3. There exists an interdependent
security
game instance in which the VCG tax-based incentive
mechanism cannot implement the socially optimal solution
while guaranteeing weak budget balance.
Proof. See Appendix C.
Intuition: This result shows a budget deficit case for the
VCG mechanism in which the central regulator has to spend
out-of-pocket money to incentivize the defenders to achieve
the social optimal solution. It was shown that
the VCG
mechanism achieves social optimality, and achieves weak
budget balance in many private and public good games (see
[36], [54], [55] for more details and related background).
However, we show for the first time that this is not satisfied in
interdependent security games. Fundamentally this is because,
in interdependent security games a defender can free ride (i.e.,
under-invest in security and depend on investments from other
defenders). Thus, such defender needs to be incentivized to
achieve the socially optimal solution.

Effect of behavioral level on amount of taxes: We now
show that higher behavioral bias (i.e., smaller α) leads to
the payment of more taxes (by defenders) under the VCG
mechanism. The reason for such increase in the taxes paid
is that if any defender Dk ∈ D becomes more behavioral,
her investments become more suboptimal and consequently
increase (worsen) the system’s social cost compared to the
case in which Dk is not a member of the society. Thus, the
VCG mechanism imposes more taxes on Dk in such scenario.
We validate this finding in our evaluation (Section VI).
C. Voluntary Participation Mechanism Design
We next explore voluntary participation in interdependent
security games modeled by attack graphs. To participate in
the mechanism, a defender Dk ∈ D should have a preference
for being part of the mechanism over opting out. In other
words, the overall cost of defender Dk under the mechanism,
which is the defender’s cost under the attained joint investment
profile by the mechanism plus the taxes paid by the defender
to the central regulator (planner), must be lower than or equal
to defender Dk’s cost under PNE (for all defenders). Formally,
a defender Dk ∈ D participates in the mechanism if
Ck(x∗) + tk ≤ Ck(¯x),
where Ck(x∗) is defender Dk’s cost under
the socially
optimal outcome (induced by the mechanism) and Ck(¯x) is
the corresponding PNE (state of anarchy) with no defender
Dk ∈ D being a part of the mechanism.
We first define a class of directed acyclic attack graphs
(DAG) defined as a “Layered DAG” [56] which is a special
case of a DAG where nodes are partitioned into l layers and
the DAG has certain properties.5
Definition 1. Let vj
i be the j-th node in layer i and Hi =
{vj
i |∀j} be the set of all nodes in layer i. In a layered DAG,
E only contains edges that connect nodes in Hi to nodes in
Hi+1, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ l − 1.
Amount of Taxes and Voluntary Participation: We now
present result on voluntary participation in our tax-based
framework for the introduced class of layered attack graphs.
Proposition 4. Suppose that G denotes a layered DAG that
has K behavioral defenders (with αk ∈ (0, 1)), where each
layer k has a single node vk and under ownership of a
defender Dk ∈ D. Suppose that the probability of successful
i,j = 1.
attack on each edge (vi, vj) is given by (2) with p0

Suppose that each defender has security budget B
Li is the financial loss of asset vi. Then, we have
1) If ti ≤ Li

(cid:2)exp(− iB
would participate in the mechanism
5The layered DAG structure represents stepping-stone nature of attacks on the
critical assets within the system that we consider here where attacker uses
one asset in one layer to progressively attack other assets in deeper layers.
2) The maximum amount of tax tmax
that a defender can be
charged and participate in the mechanism is decreasing
in the defender index i,∀i = 1,··· , K.6
i
Proof. See Appendix D.
Intuition: The above result shows two main insights about
in the
taxation and participation in the mechanism. First,
layered DAG, each defender would prefer participation in the
mechanism if the amount of taxes she pays is less than or
equal to the difference between the socially optimal solution
and the state of anarchy (PNE). Otherwise, the defender would
prefer to not participate in the mechanism since she can have
a lower cost without participation. Second, the social planner
can impose more taxes on the defenders that are nearer from
the attacker’s source node vs in the attack graph compared to
those who are far from the source node. The reason is that the
latter can free-ride on the security investments of the former
and will prefer PNE over the mechanism if they are charged
high amount of taxes. For instance, in the DAG considered in
Proposition 4, the maximum amount of tax to be imposed on
the last defender DK to participate in the mechanism is zero.
Remark 2. We also observe similar results of amount of taxes
and participation in all of our four case studies (in Section VI)
which have different attack graph structures.
VI. EVALUATION
Our evaluation aims to answer the following questions:
• What
is the gain of using mechanism design for
incentivizing behavioral defenders toward the socially
optimal solution?
• How does the level of behavioral bias affect
the
mechanism design outcomes?
• What
is the maximum tax payment under which the
defender prefers to participate in a tax-based mechanism
over the state of anarchy (PNE)?
A. Dataset Description
We use four synthesized attack graphs that
represent
real-world interdependent systems to evaluate our setups.
Specifically, we consider four popular interdependent systems
from the literature which are: DER.1 [21], SCADA [16],
E-commerce [17], and VoIP [17]. In all of these systems, nodes
represent the progression of attack steps (e.g., unauthorized
control of a physical generator in DER.1, taking privilege
of control unit software in SCADA). Note that for each of
our applications, it could be either air-gapped (here the attack
would be from an insider attacker) or externally accessible
(here the attack would be from an external adversary).
Now, we give a brief explanation of these systems and their
associated failure scenarios. We generate the attack graphs
of these systems using the CyberSage tool [21] which maps
system’s failure scenarios into an attack graph given the
workflow of that system, security goals, and attacker’s model.
6Defender Di’s asset is closer to attacker’s source node than defender Di+1’s
asset and thus defender Di securing her asset benefits all Dj, with j > i.

Fig. 5: Attack Graph of DER System
Fig. 6: Attack Graph of SCADA System
DER.1 System Description: The US National Electric
Sector Cybersecurity Organization Resource (NESCOR)
Technical Working Group has introduced a framework for
evaluating the risks of cyber attacks on the electric grid.
A distributed energy resource (DER)
is described as a
cyber-physical system consisting of entities such as generators,
storage devices, and electric vehicles, that are part of the
smart energy distribution system. The DER.1 failure scenario
has been identified as the riskiest failure scenario affecting
distributed energy resources according to the NESCOR
ranking [21]. As shown in Figure 5, there are two critical
equipment assets: a PhotoVoltaic (PV) generator and an
electric vehicle (EV) charging station. Each equipment
is
accompanied by a Human Machine Interface (HMI), the only
gateway through which the equipment can be controlled. The
DER.1 failure scenario is triggered when the attacker gets
access to the HMI. Once the attacker gets access to the system,
she changes the DER settings and gets physical access to the
DER equipment so that they continue to provide power even
during a power system fault. Through this manipulation, the
attacker can cause serious physical damage to the system.
SCADA System Description: The SCADA system is
composed of two control subsystems, where each incorporates
a number of cyber components, such as control subnetworks
and remote terminal units (RTUs), and physical components,
such as, valves controlled by the RTUs. We followed the
NIST guidelines for
industrial control systems for such
architecture [57], where each subsystem is separated from
external networks through a demilitarized zone (DMZ). The
system implements firewalls both between the DMZ and the
external networks, as well as between the DMZ and its
control subnetwork. Therefore, an attacker must bypass two
different levels of security to gain access to these control
subnetworks. These two subsystems are interdependent via the
shared corporate network, as well as due to having a common
vendor for their control equipment. The resulting attack graph
of the described system is shown in Figure 6. The “Corp” and
the “Vendor” nodes connect the two subnetworks belonging to
the two different defenders and can be used as jump points to
spread an attack from one control subsystem to the other. This
system has six critical assets (3 RTUs, Control Unit, CORP,
and DMZ). The compromise of a control network “CONTROL
i” will lead to loss of control of all 3 connected RTUs.
E-commerce System Description: The E-commerce
system overview is shown in Figure 7. The web server sits
in a DMZ separated by a firewall from the other two servers,
which are connected to a network not accessible from the
Internet. All connections from the Internet and through servers
are controlled by the firewall. Rules state that the web and
application servers can communicate, and the web server can
be reached from the Internet. Here, the attacker is assumed to
be external and thus her starting point is the Internet and uses
stepping-stone attacks with the goal of having access to the
MySQL database, represented by node 19 in the attack graph.
For this system, we follow the attack graph generated by [17]
(Figure 7 (on right), shaded nodes are detectors, not attack
steps), based on popular vulnerabilities databases [58].
VoIP System Description: As shown in Figure 8,
the
VoIP system is composed of three zones; a DMZ for the
servers accessible from the cloud, an internal network for local
resources (e.g., computers, mail server and DNS server), and
an internal network that is consisted of only VoIP components.
This architecture follows the NIST security guidelines for
deploying a secure VoIP system [59]. In this context, the
VoIP network consists of a Proxy, voicemail server, and
software-based and hardware-based phones. The firewall has
rules to control
the traffic between the three zones. Note
that the DNS and mail servers in the DMZ are the only
accessible nodes to the Internet. The PBX server can route
calls to the Internet or to a public-switched telephone network
(PSTN). The ultimate attack goal is to eavesdrop on VoIP
communication. Figure 8 shows the resultant attack graph.
Having explained the failure scenarios of our
four
interdependent systems. Next, we present our experimental
setup which includes simulation parameters and the procedure.
B. Experimental Setup
in Section II and mechanism-based models
The simulations are based on our proposed game-theoretic
models
in
Section V with the following parameters. Each system has
two defenders. For DER, E-commerce, and VoIP, we have
the financial losses Li = L = $2M,∀i. The losses of the
critical assets within SCADA (in Million dollars) are shown in
Figure 6. We used the probability of successful attack function
in (2) in our simulations. To estimate the baseline probability
of successful attack on each edge (i.e., without any security
investment), we first create a table of CVE-IDs (from real
vulnerabilities reported in the CVE database for 2000-2020).
We then followed [34] to convert the main attack’s metrics

(i.e., attack vector, attack complexity) to a baseline probability
of successful attack. Table II (in Appendix E) illustrates
this process for DER.1 and SCADA systems. We sweep the
behavioral bias α such that α ∈ [0.4, 1]; this is consistent with
the range of behavioral parameters from prior experimental
studies [19], [60]. We consider a symmetric security budget
across the defenders (unless otherwise stated). For Nash
Equilibrium, we run the best response dynamics until the game
reaches the Nash Equilibrium while the social optimal is found
using (5). TASHAROK refers to the setup with any of the
two proposed mechanisms since both mechanisms lead to the
social optimal, albeit with different tax collections.
C. Evaluation Results
Next, we show our findings from different experiments
for the four interdependent systems. Mainly, we compare the
security investments (by both classes of decision-makers),
the social costs under different investments, the per-defender
expected loss,
the amount of taxes (payments) under the
two mechanisms (from Section V), the effect of behavioral
decision-making, and the trends in voluntary participation.
Security Investments: We observe that the socially optimal
allocation leads to distributing investments only on min-cut
edges7. On the other hand, behavioral defenders distribute their

disconnect the graph. Here the same concept is applied to our attack graph.
