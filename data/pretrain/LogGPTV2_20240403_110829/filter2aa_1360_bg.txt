**Figure 10.12: Year Filters**
- In Figure 10.12, I entered the user number 4 (zuck) and a search term of "OSINT". This allows me to select a year and filter posts, photos, or videos from that specific year.

**Figure 10.11: Options with Date Filtering**
- In the first portion of Figure 10.11, I entered the user number "108659242498155" (Chicago). This enables me to query posts, photos, and videos posted from that location to any public pages. The dropdown menu allows me to specify a year, which often reveals content not found through traditional search methods.
- In the top portion of Figure 10.11, I entered the user ID number "4" (zuck). This allows me to query posts, photos, and videos posted by that user to any public pages. The dropdown menu allows me to filter by year, which is useful if the target has posted a lot of content.

**Figure 10.13: Profile Search Options**
- In Figure 10.13, I entered the user number "105930651606" (Harvard) in the first and third boxes. This allows me to query peopleâ€™s profiles by their employer or school affiliation. For example, searching for the name "Tom" will show different results: one for people named Tom who work at Harvard and another for those who attended Harvard.

**Figure 10.14: Facebook Results**
- Figure 10.14 shows the results of a profile search. The left result identifies people named Tom who work at Harvard, while the right result shows people named Tom who attended Harvard.

**Figure 10.15: Date Filters**
- Figure 10.15 displays a query for any mention of the term "osint" during the month of September 2019. Clicking these fields presents an interactive calendar for easy date selection.

#### Manual vs. Tool Queries
- **Posts by Date**: The official Facebook site allows filtering by year, but the tool allows detailed filters by exact date. For example, I searched for mentions of my site on the day it was briefly shut down due to legal demands.
- **Posts by Location**: The official LAX page can be queried, but the tool allows querying for posts from other people at that location, filtered by year.
- **Videos by Date**: The official Facebook site allows filtration by "Today", "This Week", or "This Month", but the tool allows detailed filters by year or exact date.

#### Facebook Friends Extraction
- **Scenario**: If you find a target's Facebook profile with a large list of friends and want to document this list, you can use the following method:
  1. Load the entire friends list by holding down the space bar.
  2. Highlight the entire friends list and copy it.
  3. Open Microsoft Excel and paste the content into column B.
  4. Use the "Go To" menu to select and delete all images.
  5. Paste the friend content again into column A and clear the contents to remove text but keep images.
  6. Resize columns A and B to fit the images and text.
  7. Use "Find and Replace" to remove "Add Friend" entries.
  8. Format the row height and left-justify the text in column B.

#### Email Search
- **Page Role Method**:
  1. While logged in to a covert Facebook profile, click "Create" and then "Page".
  2. Assign a random name to your profile, select any category, and continue.
  3. Skip all optional steps.
  4. Click "Settings" and then "Page Roles" in the left column.
  5. Enter the target email address in the "Assign a New Page Role" section.
  6. This should present any Facebook profiles associated with the email address.

#### Twitter Search
- **Advanced Search**:
  - **None of these words**: Filter out posts containing the chosen word(s).
  - **To these accounts**: Enter a specific Twitter username to see tweets sent to that user.
  - **This exact phrase**: Use quotes to identify exact word placement.
  - **All of these words**: Ignore word order and include each word entered.

By experimenting with both manual and automated search options, you can uncover valuable information. The results are often fascinating, and the learning curve is minimal.
