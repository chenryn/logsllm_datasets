I entered the user ID number of "4" (for the user zuck) in the first portion, as seen in Figure 10.11 (top). This 
allows me to query’ posts, photos, and videos posted by that user to any public pages. The dropdown menu 
allows me to filter by year, if desired, which is helpful if the target posted a lot of content. This option is available 
for all three queries. This often identifies content unavailable within the target's own profile.

Digital forensics enthusiast and private investigator Josh Huff at LearnAllTheThings.net has conducted a lot of 
research into the assignment of user ID numbers to Facebook profiles. We know that these numbers are 
assigned in chronological order, but the intelligence goes much further beyond that. His research could fill 
several pages and, in some situations, he can identify the month when a specific user account was 
die sake of space and most useful details, he has provided the following to me for publication.
Videos by Date; The official Facebook site allows filtration of videos by date, but you can only choose from 
"Today", "This Week", or "This Month". The tool allows detailed filters by year or exact date. The example 
below is from 2015.
I encourage you to experiment with both manual and automated search options. There is a small learning curve 
when querying Facebook, but die results are often fascinating.
Facebook transitioned from 32-bit numbers, such as 554432, to 64-bit numbers that begin with 100000 between 
April and December of 2009. Therefore, if your target's number is less than 100000000000000, the account was 
r to April 2009. An account with a 15-digit ID number would have been created after 
can break down the numbers by year. The following are rough estimates that should only 
general guideline. Facebook appears to have begun issuing random numbers in 2018.
Posts by Date: 1 can search for any term on Facebook, but I can only filter by year. With the tools, I can focus 
on any individual date. In the following example, I searched for anyone mentioning my site on the day that it 
was briefly shut down due to legal demands, I quickly found evidence.
If you are paying close attention, you can see that diere are many similarities between conducting a search directly 
within the official Facebook website and the options within my custom search tools. On the surface, these tools 
may seem redundant and unnecessary. However, I assure you that there are some key advantages to the 
Facebook tool. I present three quick examples where you can find content through the tool which is not available 
on the site.
Posts by Location: I can query the official LAX page at facebook.com/LAIntemationalAirporr, but I cannot 
query for posts from other people at that location. However, the search tool allows me to focus on posts from 
any location which can be filtered by year. The following example was presented after entering location ID 
"74286767824" and choosing "2018".’ '

use the following public profile:
I was recently presented a Facebook scenario without any obvious solution. Assume that you find the Facebo J 
profile of your target, and there is a large list of "Friends". You want to document this list, and a screenshot is 
not good enough. You want to capture the hyperlinks to each account and have a data set that can be 
manipulated or imported elsewhere.
She has several friends, so I will hold down the space bar on my keyboard to load the entire page. 1 wall now 
highlight her entire friends list and use "Ctrl" + "C" (or right-click > copy) to copy the data. 1 find it best to 
click directly above the left side of the first friend and hold until the lower right area of the last friend. The 
friends list should highlight. Now, open Microsoft Excel. Click on the "B" in column B to highlight the entire 
column. Paste the content with either "Ctrl" + "V" (or right-click > paste). This will appear disorganized, but 
the data is there. The images will be on top of the user data, which will not work for a final report.
Use F5 to launch the "Go To" menu and select "Special" in the lower left. Select "Objects" and click OK. This 
will select all of those images. Hit the delete key to remove them. You wall now see only the text data (with 
hyperlinks). Now click on the "A" in column A and paste the friend content again with either "Ctrl" + "V" (or 
right-click > paste). Right-click any cell in this column and choose "Clear Contents". This will remove any text, 
but keep the images.
There are several outdated online tools that claim to "scrape" this data, but none of them work. In 2016, 
Facebook changed their Terms of Sendee (TOS) which now blocks any type of scraping of Friend data. 
Furthermore, the Facebook API no longer allows the display of this data either. There is a solution, and it wall 
involve minimal geek work.
In previous editions, I have included various techniques to identify a Facebook profile associated with a target 
telephone number. At one time, entering a cell number into a Facebook search showed you the name, email 
address, and photo of the user. That luxury is gone, but we do currently have one method which may be helpful. 
The following URL requests Facebook to locate an account for a password reset. Entering a telephone number 
will confirm if an account is associated to it, and display a very redacted email address, such as ''n***@*******"

and ideas to circumvent the next roadblocks.
As stated previously, wc lost all standard email address search options within Facebook in 2019. However, there 
is one remaining technique which allows submission of an email address and provides identification of an 
associated profile. However, it is not simple or straightforward. It will take some work to set up, but will then 
be available as needed. This is often referred to as the "Page Role" trick. The premise is that you create a 
Facebook business page and then assign another profile to possess management rights. When you enter the 
email address of the target, Facebook confirms the name and profile to make sure you truly want to give away 
authorization to the person. We can then cancel the request without any notification to the target. The following 
steps replicate this technique.
Place your mouse in between columns A and B and resize column A to be a bit larger than one of the images. 
Do the same with Column B to fit in all of the text. Use the "Find and Replace" feature to find ever}' instance 
of "Add Friend" and replace it with nothing. This will remove those unnecessary entries. In the "Home" menu, 
choose "Format" and then "Auto Fit Row’ Height". This will eliminate unnecessary spacing. Select Column B 
and Left Justify the text. Your final result will be a clean spreadsheet with all of the images, names, and active 
links from your target's Facebook "friends" page. This is not the cleanest way of doing things, but it will work.
