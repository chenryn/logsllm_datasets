### I2P Network Analysis and Censorship Resistance

#### Peer Distribution
In countries with more than 50 peers [48], there are 30 countries hosting a combined total of 6,000 I2P peers. China leads with over 2,000 peers, followed by Singapore and Turkey with approximately 700 and 600 peers, respectively.

Given that China actively blocks access to Tor [13, 69] and VPNs [4, 5], a significant number of Chinese users may opt for the I2P network. The number of Chinese I2P users could increase if more out-proxies become consistently available. Although I2P peers in China are often configured to operate in hidden mode by default [48, 73], router operators can disable this setting to improve reachability and performance.

#### Autonomous Systems (AS) Analysis
Figure 11 highlights the top 20 autonomous systems (ASes) from which most I2P addresses originate. AS7922 (Comcast Cable Communications, LLC) is at the top with more than 8,000 peers. These 20 ASes collectively account for over 30% of the observed I2P peers.

As noted in Section 5.2.2, 58.9% of peers change their IP address at least once. By mapping these IP addresses to ASNs and countries, we find that most peers remain within the same AS or geographic region, despite having multiple IP addresses. This is reasonable given that ISPs often rotate IP addresses dynamically for residential connections, but these addresses typically belong to the same subnet.

#### Reseed Server Blocking
In April 2017, a post on the I2P developer forum reported that reseed servers were blocked in China [49]. Our tests from vantage points within China indicated that some reseed servers were still accessible. Additionally, China is among the top-20 countries with the most I2P peers. A previous study [14] suggests two possibilities: small-scale blocking at provincial ISPs or temporary failures in the Great Firewall of China (GFW).

The current I2P network primarily functions as a self-contained network due to the intermittent availability of outproxies. As the network grows and outproxy support stabilizes, large-scale blocking is likely. I2P developers have included a manual reseeding feature, allowing active peers to create and share reseed files (i.e., i2pseeds.su3) via secondary channels, similar to how Tor distributes bridge nodes. This makes it challenging for censors to block all active I2P peers.

#### Probabilistic Address-Based Blocking
We consider a censor who monitors the network to gather information about active peers (IP address and port) to prevent local users from accessing I2P. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of this blocking approach.

**Setting:**
- **Censor:** Operates monitoring routers to gather information.
- **Victim:** A user the censor wants to prevent from accessing I2P.

By operating 20 routers, a censor can block over 95% of peer IP addresses known to the victim. If the blacklist time window expands to 5, 10, 20, or 30 days, the blocking rate increases significantly, reaching over 98% with 20 routers.

**Network Usability:**
Using null routing, we tested the impact of address-based blocking on page load times for eepsites. Without blockage, the average load time is 3.4 seconds. At a 65% blocking rate, the latency increases to over 20 seconds, with 40% of requests timing out. Higher blocking rates (70-90%) cause even greater latencies and timeouts, severely degrading network usability.

#### Potential Solutions to Blocking
To counteract blocking, I2P can adopt the use of bridges, similar to Tor. Newly joined peers, less likely to be immediately discovered and blocked, can serve as bridges. However, this solution is only suitable for short-term access. For longer-term access, combining newly joined peers with firewalled peers (approximately 14,000 daily) can be more sustainable. Firewalled peers, lacking public IP addresses, are less susceptible to address-based blocking.

#### From Blocking to Other Types of Attacks
While this study focuses on blocking, the probabilistic blocking model can also facilitate other attacks, such as traffic analysis for deanonymization. After blocking most active peers, an attacker can inject malicious routers and force victims to use them, narrowing their view of the network and enabling further attacks.

### Conclusion
This study provides insights into the I2P anonymity network and its resistance to censorship. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for enhancing the network's robustness and ensuring continued access for users in restrictive environments.
