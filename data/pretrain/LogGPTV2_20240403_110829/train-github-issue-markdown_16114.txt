This code (as reported in this SO question):
    fn foo(t: &mut int){
        println!("{}", t);
    }
    fn main() {
        let test = 10;
        let h = move || {
            let mut r = &mut test.clone();
            foo(r);
        };
        h();
    }
causes an assertion failure in LLVM code:
    Assertion failed: (S->getType()->isPtrOrPtrVectorTy() && "Invalid cast"), function CreatePointerCast, file /Users/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/nightly-mac/build/src/llvm/lib/IR/Instructions.cpp, line 2522.
