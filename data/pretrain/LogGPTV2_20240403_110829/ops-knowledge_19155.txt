Question: "An Android Keymaster RSA key is configured with both `KeyPurpose::ENCRYPT` and `KeyPurpose::SIGN` purposes. Why could this configuration be considered insecure?"
 "A": "Using the same key for both encryption and signing does not pose any security risk if the key is stored securely."
 "B": "An attacker could potentially exploit this configuration to generate valid signatures by decrypting arbitrary data."
 "C": "RSA keys are inherently insecure and should not be used for encryption or signing purposes."
 "D": "This configuration limits the key's functionality and hinders the performance of the Android Keymaster."
Answer: B
