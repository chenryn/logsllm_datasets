# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Add an option to enter a custom window resolution in the FancyZones editor.
So users _(who use FancyZones for resizing windows)_ can add their preferred
zone resolution Like (1024x576) or (1080x720) _in a Text-box for example._
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
When edit my custom FancyZones layout. A text-box appears on the zone that
allow me to enter a preferred zone size. (or maybe add it as a right click
option)
