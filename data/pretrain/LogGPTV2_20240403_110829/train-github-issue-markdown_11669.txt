### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

Add an option to enter a custom window resolution in the FancyZones editor. This will allow users who use FancyZones for resizing windows to specify their preferred zone resolution, such as 1024x576 or 1080x720, by entering it in a text box.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

When editing a custom FancyZones layout, a text box should appear within each zone, allowing users to enter their preferred zone size. Alternatively, this functionality could be added as a right-click option within the editor.
