ABSTRACT
The SSL and TLS infrastructure used in important protocols like
HTTPs and IMAPs is built on an X.509 public key infrastructure
(PKI). X.509 certiﬁcates are thus used to authenticate services like
online banking, shopping, e-mail, etc. However, it always has been
felt that the certiﬁcation processes of this PKI may not be con-
ducted with enough rigor, resulting in a deployment where many
certiﬁcates do not meet the requirements of a secure PKI.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of X.509 certiﬁ-
cates in the wild. To shed more light on the state of the deployed
and actually used X.509 PKI, we obtained and evaluated data from
many different sources. We conducted HTTPs scans of a large
number of popular HTTPs servers over a 1.5-year time span, in-
cluding scans from nine locations distributed over the globe. To
compare certiﬁcation properties of highly ranked hosts with the
global picture, we included a third-party scan of the entire IPv4
space in our analyses. Furthermore, we monitored live SSL/TLS
trafﬁc on a 10 Gbps uplink of a large research network. This allows
us to compare the properties of the deployed PKI with the part of
the PKI that is being actively accessed by users.
Our analyses reveal that the quality of certiﬁcation lacks in strin-
gency, due to a number of reasons among which invalid certiﬁca-
tion chains and certiﬁcate subjects give the most cause for concern.
Similar concerns can be raised for other properties of certiﬁcation
chains and also for many self-signed certiﬁcates used in the de-
ployed X.509 PKI. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm what has long been be-
lieved – namely that the X.509 PKI that we use so often in our
everyday’s lives is in a sorry state.

INTRODUCTION
Security, privacy and data integrity are important properties of
today’s Internet applications and protocols. As the Internet is be-
ing used for many commercial activities, such as shopping, on-
line banking, or electronic trading, the value of data has increased.
Networking protocols and applications are therefore increasingly
expected to protect critical data by providing encryption, data in-
tegrity, and, most importantly, entity authentication. As these se-
curity goals are difﬁcult to attain, application developers and pro-
tocol designers often rely on well-established security layers below
their own protocols. The SSL and TLS protocol suites are used by
many applications and protocols to provide a certain level of se-
curity, as they build on well-understood and thoroughly-analyzed
cryptographic algorithms. Authentication is done using a public
key infrastructure (PKI) built with the X.509 standard.
Cryptographic algorithms can be mathematically analyzed with
respect to the security they offer, and implementations of these al-
gorithms can be checked for correctness. Hence, it is possible to
estimate the level of security they provide with a fair amount of
conﬁdence. In contrast, X.509 infrastructures depend not only on
cryptography, but also on various organizations and entities that
are required to conduct their work in conformance with abstract
process descriptions. Certiﬁcation Authorities (CAs), for example,
certify the identities and public keys of other entities in an X.509
certiﬁcate. CAs need to conduct an identity check at a certain level
of thoroughness before issuing a certiﬁcate. However, these CA-
internal work processes are difﬁcult to assess from the outside, and
thus users need to place their trust into the correct working of a
CA. As many of these processes involve human work, factors such
as negligence or malice can introduce problems – yet entity authen-
tication relies completely on the correct execution of identiﬁcation
processes. Web clients are a good example for this: browser ven-
dors decide which CAs are included in their so-called Root Stores,
i.e., their lists of trusted CAs. This reveals a classic dilemma: al-
though this method removes control from end-users, it is difﬁcult
to imagine a better method, as it would likely be too much to ask
of users themselves to assess the trustworthiness of CAs. How-
ever, the number of trusted CAs has grown very large (more than
150 in the case of Mozilla Firefox). This raises the question: can
we assess the quality of the PKI that has thus been established?
Although we cannot verify the implementation of work processes
427within a CA from outside, we can observe and analyze the results
of these processes: the deployed X.509 public key infrastructure.
This paper conducts a thorough analysis of the currently de-
ployed and practically used X.509 infrastructure for TLS/SSL and
examines its security-related properties. To obtain an overall pic-
ture of the deployed PKI, we collected X.509 certiﬁcates over a
time-span of more than 1.5 years, and from several measurement
points. Furthermore, we used passive trafﬁc measurements on a
10Gbps link to obtain a picture of which parts of the PKI are actu-
ally used. We observed about 250 million TLS/SSL sessions over a
four-week time span and extracted certiﬁcates from these sessions.
We then evaluated the security-relevant properties of all acquired
certiﬁcates. Last, but not least, we included data from previous
third-party work into our analysis to be able to extend our view and
compare our work with previous evaluations.
Contributions. Using these data sets, we evaluated the state of
the currently deployed infrastructure and estimated its quality as
encountered by users. We can show how often popular hosts of-
fer TLS/SSL and what the negotiated ciphers and key lengths are.
Most importantly, we present a number of results that show the cer-
tiﬁcation infrastructure to be broken at several points: certiﬁcation
chains are often invalid, host names in subjects are frequently in-
correct, and many certiﬁcates are re-used on too many hosts. This
leads to a very low number of certiﬁcates that are accepted by e.g., a
Web browser: only one out of ﬁve certiﬁcates can be counted as ab-
solutely valid. Even then, some of these certiﬁcates exhibit weak-
nesses like weak signature algorithms. We also show which errors
in certiﬁcation chains are most common, how long these chains are,
and the surprisingly small number of distinct chains that are actu-
ally used. Furthermore, we assess the properties of public keys and
signature algorithms. We also include an analysis of occurrences of
cryptographically weak keys. Thanks to the long-time observations
and the geographic distribution, we are able to capture and describe
the rather slow development of the X.509 PKI.
Organization. The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 introduces X.509 and the structure of the PKI that is
built upon the standard. We highlight relevant security parameters
and properties, possible ﬂaws in the processes that are responsible
for setting these parameters, and the security implications of such
errors. Section 3 presents related work that previously analyzed the
X.509 infrastructure, and discusses how our work differs and ex-
tends these previous evaluations. Our data sets, their properties and
the active and passive measurement methodology that we used to
obtain the data are presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents the
actual analysis of security-related PKI properties based on these
data sets. Our paper concludes with a discussion in Section 6.
2. X.509 PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE
This section introduces the public key infrastructure that is used
by SSL and TLS. We describe those parts of X.509 that are relevant
for this paper.
X.509 is an ITU-T standard for a public key infrastructure (PKI)
and has been adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
as the PKI for several IETF protocols [1]. Thus, X.509 certiﬁcates
are an integral part of the SSL and TLS protocol suites [2]: most
often, they are used for server authentication in TLS/SSL, where
the server presents its certiﬁcates to the client. Certiﬁcates are thus
important for various protocols such as HTTPs, IMAPs, SMTPs
and POP3s.
X.509 deﬁnes a somewhat complex certiﬁcation infrastructure.
Certiﬁcation Authorities (CAs) are issuers of certiﬁcates, which are
essentially a cryptographic binding of identity and public key. The
binding is achieved with a digital signature. The identity is stored

in the so-called subject ﬁeld of the certiﬁcate (Fig. 1). Every CA
must ensure it only issues a certiﬁcate to the correct entity that is
identiﬁed in the subject. This is most commonly a DNS host name.
As certiﬁcates contain information about communication peers,
they are commonly exchanged at the beginning of a session setup.
A communication peer must analyze its peer’s certiﬁcate in order to
determine whether it considers it to be the desired communication
partner. To this end, it checks whether the certiﬁcate was issued
and signed by a CA that it has trust in. Then, it checks if the in-
formation in the certiﬁcate identiﬁes the other peer as the intended
communication partner. In the example of the WWW, a browser
needs to check if the domain in the certiﬁcate really is the domain
it intends to connect to. Apart from identity and public key infor-
mation, a certiﬁcate contains further important data, e.g., a validity
period.
The X.509 PKI can be viewed as a tree or, since many CAs ex-
ist, a forest. Figure 2 displays a toy example for such a forest.
CAs reside at the top and issue certiﬁcates. For this purpose, they
issue certiﬁcates to themselves (self-signed certiﬁcates), so-called
Root Certiﬁcates (Rx). These are then used for signing, i.e., issuing
certiﬁcates. Instead of issuing certiﬁcates directly to end-entities
(Ex), it is allowable – and in practice often done – that CAs issue
intermediate certiﬁcates (Ix) that are then used for further signing
processes. There are several reasons for this. First, it allows CAs to
delegate the identiﬁcation process to other authorities. This is espe-
cially useful for globally operating CAs as it spreads the workload
to local registrars, who are supposedly also more competent at local
identiﬁcation procedures. However, intermediate certiﬁcates do not
necessarily identify other authorities. They can also be used for se-
curity reasons: they allow a CA to sign an intermediate certiﬁcate
with their Root Certiﬁcate. The intermediate certiﬁcate can then
be used in the CA’s online issuing business and can be replaced or
revoked at any time, whereas the Root Certiﬁcate (R1, R2) is kept
safe off-line. An intermediate certiﬁcate may be used to sign fur-
ther intermediate certiﬁcates. The result is a so-called trust chain
or certiﬁcation chain, which may (in theory) be arbitrarily long.
The number of intermediate authorities and certiﬁcates thus in-
creases the number of points for attack. It also removes some con-

We are aware of two previous contributions on certiﬁcate analy-
sis for TLS/SSL. Both were given as talks at hacking symposia, but
have not been published as articles. Between April and July 2010,
members of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and iSEC
Partners conducted a scan of the entire IPv4 space on port 443 and
downloaded the X.509 certiﬁcates. Initial results were presented at
[8] and [9]. A second scan was conducted in August 2010. The au-
thors focused on determining the certiﬁcation structure, i.e., num-
ber and role of CAs, and several noteworthy certiﬁcate properties
like “weird” subjects (e.g., localhost) or issuers.
Ristic conducted a similar scan like EFF in July 2010 and pre-
sented some results in talks at BlackHat 2010 [10] and again (now
including the EFF data) at InfoSec 2011 [11]. The initial scan was
conducted on 119 million domain names, and additionally on the
hosts on the Alexa Top 1 Million list [12]. He arrived at about
870,000 servers to assess, although the exact methodology cannot
be derived from [10, 11]. However, the information about certiﬁ-
cates and ciphers collected is the same as in our scans, and together
with the EFF data set, our data sets provide a more complete cov-
erage.
Lee et al. also conducted a scan of TLS/SSL servers [13]. In con-
trast to our work, they did not investigate certiﬁcates but focused on
properties of TLS/SSL connections (i.e., ciphers, MACs, etc.) and
