## Abstract
The SSL and TLS protocols, which are fundamental to secure communication in important applications such as HTTPS and IMAPs, rely on an X.509 public key infrastructure (PKI) for authentication. Despite their critical role, there have been concerns that the certification processes in this PKI may not be rigorous enough, leading to a deployment where many certificates do not meet the required security standards.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of X.599 certificates in real-world use. To gain a deeper understanding of the deployed and actively used X.509 PKI, we gathered and evaluated data from multiple sources. We conducted HTTPS scans of a large number of popular servers over a 1.5-year period, including scans from nine globally distributed locations. Additionally, we incorporated a third-party scan of the entire IPv4 space to compare the certification properties of highly ranked hosts with the global picture. Furthermore, we monitored live SSL/TLS traffic on a 10 Gbps uplink of a large research network, allowing us to compare the properties of the deployed PKI with the part of the PKI that is being actively accessed by users.

Our analyses reveal significant issues in the quality of certification, primarily due to invalid certification chains and incorrect certificate subjects. Similar concerns arise for other properties of certification chains and for many self-signed certificates used in the deployed X.509 PKI. Our findings confirm long-held beliefs that the X.509 PKI, which we rely on daily, is in a poor state.

## 1. Introduction
Security, privacy, and data integrity are crucial for today's Internet applications and protocols. As the Internet is increasingly used for commercial activities like shopping, online banking, and electronic trading, the value of data has grown. Consequently, networking protocols and applications are expected to provide encryption, data integrity, and, most importantly, entity authentication. Achieving these security goals is challenging, and developers often rely on well-established security layers, such as the SSL and TLS protocol suites, which use the X.509 standard for authentication.

While cryptographic algorithms can be mathematically analyzed and their implementations checked for correctness, X.509 infrastructures depend on various organizations and entities that must conduct their work in conformance with abstract process descriptions. For example, Certification Authorities (CAs) certify the identities and public keys of other entities in X.509 certificates. However, these CA-internal processes are difficult to assess externally, and users must trust that CAs operate correctly. This reliance on CAs, combined with the human factors involved, introduces potential vulnerabilities.

This paper conducts a thorough analysis of the currently deployed and practically used X.509 infrastructure for TLS/SSL, examining its security-related properties. We collected X.509 certificates over more than 1.5 years from several measurement points and used passive traffic measurements on a 10 Gbps link to observe which parts of the PKI are actually used. We also included data from previous third-party work to extend our view and compare our findings with previous evaluations.

### Contributions
Using these datasets, we evaluated the state of the currently deployed infrastructure and estimated its quality as experienced by users. We show how often popular hosts offer TLS/SSL, the negotiated ciphers and key lengths, and present results indicating that the certification infrastructure is flawed at several points. Many certification chains are invalid, host names in subjects are frequently incorrect, and many certificates are reused on too many hosts. Only one out of five certificates can be considered absolutely valid, and even these exhibit weaknesses like weak signature algorithms. We also analyze the common errors in certification chains, their lengths, and the surprisingly small number of distinct chains in use. Additionally, we assess the properties of public keys and signature algorithms, including the occurrence of cryptographically weak keys. Our long-term observations and geographic distribution allow us to capture and describe the slow development of the X.509 PKI.

## 2. X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
This section introduces the public key infrastructure used by SSL and TLS, focusing on the relevant aspects of the X.509 standard.

X.509 is an ITU-T standard for a public key infrastructure (PKI) and has been adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for several IETF protocols. X.509 certificates are integral to the SSL and TLS protocol suites, primarily used for server authentication. These certificates are essential for various protocols such as HTTPS, IMAPs, SMTPs, and POP3s.

X.509 defines a complex certification infrastructure. Certification Authorities (CAs) issue certificates, which bind an identity and a public key using a digital signature. The identity is stored in the subject field of the certificate (Figure 1). Each CA must ensure it only issues a certificate to the correct entity identified in the subject, typically a DNS host name. During session setup, communication peers exchange certificates to verify each other's identity. A peer checks if the certificate was issued and signed by a trusted CA and if the information in the certificate identifies the intended communication partner. In the context of web browsing, a browser checks if the domain in the certificate matches the intended domain. Certificates also contain additional important data, such as a validity period.

The X.509 PKI can be visualized as a tree or, due to the existence of many CAs, a forest (Figure 2). CAs issue self-signed root certificates (Rx) and intermediate certificates (Ix), which can be used to sign further certificates. This allows CAs to delegate the identification process to other authorities, spreading the workload and potentially improving local identification procedures. Intermediate certificates can also enhance security by allowing CAs to keep their root certificates offline while using intermediate certificates for online operations. The result is a trust chain or certification chain, which can be arbitrarily long in theory. The number of intermediate authorities and certificates increases the attack surface and removes some control from the root CAs.

## 3. Related Work
We are aware of two previous contributions on certificate analysis for TLS/SSL, both presented at hacking symposia but not published as articles. Between April and July 2010, members of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and iSEC Partners conducted a scan of the entire IPv4 space on port 443, downloading X.509 certificates. Initial results were presented at [8] and [9], and a second scan was conducted in August 2010. The authors focused on the certification structure and noteworthy certificate properties.

Ristic conducted a similar scan in July 2010, presenting results at BlackHat 2010 [10] and InfoSec 2011 [11]. The initial scan covered 119 million domain names and the Alexa Top 1 Million list, resulting in about 870,000 servers. Although the exact methodology is not detailed, the information collected is similar to our scans. Combined with the EFF dataset, our data provides more comprehensive coverage.

Lee et al. also conducted a scan of TLS/SSL servers [13], but they focused on connection properties (ciphers, MACs, etc.) rather than certificates.
