User: I am on Windows 7.  I have Python 2.7.8 (64 bit) installed.  Today, I changed the default program that opens .py files from IDLE to Windows Command Processor and stupidly selected the checkbox that said "always use the selected program to open this kind of file".
What I want to do is change my default program back to IDLE.
When I attempt to change it back to IDLE, I go to Control Panel\Programs\Default Programs\Set Associations and select the .py name and click Change Program.  I do see python.exe but selecting that does nothing.  I then use the "Browse" button to navigate to C:\Python27\Lib\idlelib but don't know if I should select idle.py, idle.pyw, idle.bat or some other IDLE program that will force the default program to be IDLE!
Nothing happens after I select one of these.
How do I make IDLE be the default program that opens .py files and now disassociate Windows Command Processor from being the default?
Assistant: Right click on any .py file
Click Open With...
Click Choose a default program...
IfIDLEis on the list, click it.
else
Click Browse, and find the IDLE program
Click OK and voila!
