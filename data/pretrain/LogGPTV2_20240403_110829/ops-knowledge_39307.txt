### Issue: Changing the Default Program for .py Files Back to IDLE on Windows 7

**Current Situation:**
- **Operating System:** Windows 7
- **Python Version:** Python 2.7.8 (64-bit)
- **Current Default Program for .py Files:** Windows Command Processor
- **Desired Default Program:** IDLE

**Problem:**
You changed the default program that opens `.py` files from IDLE to the Windows Command Processor and selected the "Always use the selected program to open this kind of file" option. Now, you want to revert this change and set IDLE as the default program again.

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Right-Click on a .py File:**
   - Navigate to a `.py` file in your file explorer.
   - Right-click on the file to open the context menu.

2. **Select "Open With...":**
   - In the context menu, choose "Open with...".
   - This will open a new window where you can select the program to open the file.

3. **Choose a Default Program:**
   - Click on "Choose another app" or "Choose a default program..." (the exact wording may vary slightly depending on your Windows version).
   - If IDLE is listed, select it and check the box "Always use this app to open .py files". Then click "OK".

4. **If IDLE is Not Listed:**
   - Click on "Browse...".
   - Navigate to the location where IDLE is installed. The typical path is `C:\Python27\Lib\idlelib`.
   - In the `idlelib` folder, you will see several files. The correct file to select is `idle.bat` (this is the batch file that launches IDLE).
   - Select `idle.bat` and click "Open".
   - Check the box "Always use this app to open .py files" and click "OK".

**Verification:**
- After following these steps, double-click on a `.py` file to ensure that it opens with IDLE.
- If it still opens with the Windows Command Processor, repeat the steps to ensure that `idle.bat` was correctly selected and the "Always use this app" option was checked.

By following these steps, you should be able to set IDLE as the default program for opening `.py` files and disassociate the Windows Command Processor from being the default.
