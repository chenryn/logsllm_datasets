We've had quite a few issues crop up about how to define types of outputs
given inputs. My view is that this is revealing limitations in the promotion
system. A proposal to deal with this might be to define arithmetic on types.
For example, here would be some rules:
    Int*Int == Int
    Int+Int == Int
    Meter{Float64}+Meter{Float64} == Meter{Float64}
    Meter{Float64}*Meter{Float64} == Meter{Float64}^2
    Meter{Float64}/Meter{Float64} == Float64
    Matrix{Int}+Matrix{Float64} == Matrix{Float64}
and so on.
