other hand, adding signals to individual ﬂows sidesteps is-
sues around packet loss, dynamic IP addresses, and network
address translation.
A second consequence of this strategy is that Telex and
Decoy routing must hijack a TCP session already in place,
whereas Cirripede (transparently) proxies the entire TCP
session of registered users. Such hijacking is complicated by
the possibility of asymmetric paths, which are common in
the Internet [18], since only half of the connection might be
seen by the server. Telex is designed to work only for sym-
metric communication paths, whereas Decoy routing han-
dles this case by having the client use a covert channel to
196send information about the part of the connection unseen by
the router. Hijacking must also be performed in real time,
whereas the Cirripede registration process is more tolerant
of processing delays at the service.
Telex uses a signaling protocol that, like Cirripede, uses
Diﬃe-Hellman over an elliptic curve; it uses a diﬀerent curve
and has additional security features that protect against po-
tential replay attacks by the warden. Decoy routing opts
to use symmetric-key cryptography for signaling in order to
achieve better scalability; it therefore requires each client
to negotiate a shared key with the service using some out-
of-band mechanism. Finally, Telex has some support for
mimicking the TCP stack of the overt destination to avoid
ﬁngerprinting attacks [37] that could be used by the warden
to detect the presence of a proxy. We leave a full analysis
of the practical implications of the above design tradeoﬀs to
future work.
7.3 Unobservable Communication
Vasserman et al. [54] create a membership concealing over-
lay network (MCON) for unobservable communication; they
aim to make it diﬃcult for either an insider or outsider ad-
versary to learn the set of participating members. All com-
munication in MCON takes place over links between individ-
ual members who trust each other. This is similar to previ-
ous “darknet” designs, such as WASTE [21], Turtle [43], and
recent versions of Freenet [13, 14]; Vasserman et al. identify
security ﬂaws in those designs and propose improvements.
To be eﬀective, MCON requires a large number of partici-
pants to create a well-connected network, so that new clients
can easily ﬁnd points to join, whereas Cirripede requires a
small number of servers, albeit well-placed in the network.
The MCON evaluation further focuses on communication
between members, rather than connection to external desti-
nations. Another system for unobservable communication,
NoneSuch [28], uses image steganography, similar to Col-
lage. It uses the Usenet network for exchanging images and
does not aim to address blocking by censors.
8. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented Cirripede, a system for un-
observable communication with Internet destinations to cir-
cumvent monitoring and censoring technologies. Our design
leverages in-network support to intercept client requests and
redirect them to a covert destination, in a manner diﬃcult
to observe by adversaries who may control the client’s access
network. Through simulations on the Internet topology, we
ﬁnd that a small number of tier-1 ASes deploying our de-
sign can provide access to most end hosts in the Internet.
Through an emulation-based study of an implementation of
our design, we ﬁnd that our design can process packets with
low overheads.
