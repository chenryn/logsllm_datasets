### Adding Signals to Individual Flows

Adding signals to individual flows circumvents issues related to packet loss, dynamic IP addresses, and network address translation (NAT).

### Consequences of This Strategy

A secondary consequence of this approach is that systems like Telex and Decoy Routing must hijack an existing TCP session. In contrast, Cirripede transparently proxies the entire TCP session for registered users. Hijacking a TCP session is complicated by the possibility of asymmetric paths, which are common in the Internet [18]. Asymmetric paths can cause only half of the connection to be visible to the server. Telex is designed to work only with symmetric communication paths, while Decoy Routing handles asymmetric paths by using a covert channel to send information about the part of the connection that is not seen by the router. Additionally, hijacking must be performed in real time, whereas the Cirripede registration process is more tolerant of processing delays.

### Signaling Protocols

Telex uses a signaling protocol similar to Cirripede, employing Diffie-Hellman over an elliptic curve. However, it uses a different curve and includes additional security features to protect against potential replay attacks by the warden. Decoy Routing opts for symmetric-key cryptography for signaling to achieve better scalability, requiring each client to negotiate a shared key with the service using some out-of-band mechanism. Finally, Telex has some support for mimicking the TCP stack of the overt destination to avoid fingerprinting attacks [37] that could be used by the warden to detect the presence of a proxy. A full analysis of the practical implications of these design trade-offs is left for future work.

### Unobservable Communication

Vasserman et al. [54] developed a membership-concealing overlay network (MCON) for unobservable communication, aiming to make it difficult for both insider and outsider adversaries to learn the set of participating members. All communication in MCON occurs over links between trusted individual members, similar to previous "darknet" designs such as WASTE [21], Turtle [43], and recent versions of Freenet [13, 14]. Vasserman et al. identify security flaws in these designs and propose improvements. For MCON to be effective, a large number of participants is required to create a well-connected network, allowing new clients to easily find points to join. In contrast, Cirripede requires only a small number of well-placed servers. The MCON evaluation focuses on communication between members rather than connections to external destinations. Another system for unobservable communication, NoneSuch [28], uses image steganography, similar to Collage, and leverages the Usenet network for exchanging images, but does not aim to address blocking by censors.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we presented Cirripede, a system for unobservable communication with Internet destinations to circumvent monitoring and censorship technologies. Our design leverages in-network support to intercept client requests and redirect them to a covert destination, making it difficult for adversaries who may control the client's access network to observe. Through simulations on the Internet topology, we found that a small number of tier-1 ASes deploying our design can provide access to most end hosts on the Internet. An emulation-based study of our implementation shows that our design can process packets with low overhead.
