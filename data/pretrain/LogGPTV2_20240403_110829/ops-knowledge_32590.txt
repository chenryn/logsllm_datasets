User: While the copy is in progress, can we put a PC into sleep mode for a specific period of time, then wake up and continue copy using python script? Can you please share the code?
Actually this is possible using shell script.
Assistant: If you have "Wake On Lan" enabled you could potentially run a python script on a different PC and trigger the wake up after your specific period of time. 
The scripts would probably need to talk to each other, unless you just do it all at times set in advance.
