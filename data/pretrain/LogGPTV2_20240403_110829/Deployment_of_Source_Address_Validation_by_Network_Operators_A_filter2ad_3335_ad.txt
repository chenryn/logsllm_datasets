control group. Only the ASes in NOG group in Brazil reme-
diate signiﬁcantly faster than the control group (p = 0.05).
Preﬁx-level remediation: Remediation can also occur at the
preﬁx level, having both SAV compliant and non-compliant
preﬁxes within the same AS. Figure 6 shows the survival
curves of remediation using BGP preﬁxes as unit of analysis.
Similar to both the organization-level and AS-level remedia-
tion, we observe no signiﬁcant difference between the groups.
Again, the only exception is the NOG group which remediated
slightly faster than the rest of the groups.

C. Main Experimental Effects
In this section, we analyze the differences in remediation
rates across different experimental groups. We use relative risk
ratio (RR) as a descriptive statistic to measure the probability
of deploying SAV in one group compared to the probability
of deploying SAV in the other group.
1) Impact of the CERTs Groups: We further compared the
remediation across the CERT groups. Our motivation was to
explore if there are signiﬁcant differences between national
CERTs. We calculate relative risk ratio between each pair of
CERTs. In simple terms, this ratio produces a factor by which
one CERT is different from the other in terms of remediation
rate.
Figure 7 only displays the countries for which risk ratios—
the differences in remediation—were signiﬁcant. We deter-
mine the signiﬁcance by looking at the conﬁdence intervals
(CI). If the CI includes the value 1, the RR is not statistically
signiﬁcant. If CI contain 1, it would mean that the relative
remediations have no difference [61]. We interpret the ﬁgure
row-wise for each national CERT. For instance, France had 4.2
times higher remediation rate than Argentina. In our sample,

D. Comparison with Spoofer
We requested operators to run the Spoofer tool [7] to
validate if they have correctly deployed SAV. A total of 1,670
ASes submitted tests using the Spoofer tool in the study period
(Oct 2019 - Feb 2021). While we cannot know if our request
caused the operators to use Spoofer tool, the overlap between
the ASes from the Spoofer tool and our methodology is around
12% (296 ASes). It signiﬁes that our experiment did not get
contaminated because of the Spoofer project. Note that the
Spoofer project sends monthly notiﬁcations to NOG lists and
often gets presented at conferences. MANRS also recommends
using the Spoofer tool to test SAV deployment [62].
We also analyzed the remediations reported by the Spoofer
tool [7]. In total across all Spoofer measurements, 98 ASes
in Spoofer data implemented SAV in their network during our
study period (Oct 2020 - Feb 2021). Of these, 22 ASes overlap
with our measurements and 5 of them are in the control group.
Since we did not send notiﬁcations to the control group, this
clearly demonstrates that there is some natural remediation
occuring. It is important to note that we sent notiﬁcations
to 2,563 ASes which had not deployed SAV, while during
the study period, the Spoofer dataset revealed only 248 ASes
without SAV.
We can conclude from these results that there is limited
evidence that operators acted upon our notiﬁcations. Moreover,
positive remediation rates in the control group signals that
factors other than our interventions inﬂuenced SAV as well.
V. FACTORS AFFECTING REMEDIATION RATES
Multiple factors could have affected remediation rates. Such
factors could range from the size and complexity of the
network, to the lack of budget and/or expertise. In this section
we ﬁrst identify potential factors that might have an impact
on SAV implementation rates, and then quantify this impact
through regression analysis.
In response to our notiﬁcations, three operators requested
additional guidance or information. For instance, one operator
claimed that his network was fully compliant. However, in
further discussion, with the evidence from the measurements,
he acknowledged that part of his network was recently up-
graded and was not compliant. The operator subsequently
implemented SAV in the network and did not reappear in
our measurements. Other operators showed signs they lacked
SAV knowledge. For example, two operators did not fully
understand our measurement methodology and thought that we
were notifying them about open-resolvers in their networks.

countries with signiﬁcant risk ratios are displayed.
Fig. 8. Relative risk ratios among countries in the NOG group.
only networks in France, Iran, Iraq, and the Netherlands
assigned to the CERT group were more likely to remediate
than the other countries.
2) Impact of
the NOG Group: We also calculated the
relative risk ratios between the countries assigned to a NOG
experimental group. Figure 8 only shows the countries that
signiﬁcant differ in remediation. We used the conﬁdence
intervals to determine the signiﬁcance as explained earlier.
Germany, France and Lebanon NOG’s were more likely to
remediate than other countries outside of Brazil in our sample.
The RR for Brazilian NOG did not have any signiﬁcant value,
which in other words means that ASes in Brazilian NOG did
not remediate more than other countries.
3) Impact of Nudges on Remediation: We explore the effec-
tiveness of adding social and reciprocity nudges to the baseline
text of notiﬁcations on remediation rates. We aggregate data
for each of the nudging conditions (baseline, social, and
reciprocity) from the different treatment groups and compare
them against the control group. In Table I, we show the relative
risk of remediation with reference to the control group. All
of the nudges have a relative risk of around one compared
to the control, which shows the nudges did not signiﬁcantly
impact remediation. In other words, operators that received
the notiﬁcation with a nudge were as likely to remediate as
operators in the control group.

We responded with a detailed explanation of our methodology.
We did not receive further responses.
This anecdotal evidence suggests that lack of information
or knowledge could have inﬂuenced the operators’ decisions
to not implement SAV in their networks. There could also
be socio-technical reasons for non-compliance, such as oper-
ators in countries with low GDP based on Purchasing Power
Parity(PPP), lower Internet penetration, and limited learning
opportunities. To further understand the impact of these fac-
tors, we built a Cox proportional hazards model with mixed
effects. At the multivariate level of analysis, we performed
a two-level Cox proportional regression analysis to examine
