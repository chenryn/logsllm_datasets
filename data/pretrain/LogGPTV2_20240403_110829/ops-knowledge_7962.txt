User:  company needs to build a high-availability load balancing cluster to achieve traffic distribution and disaster recovery and fault tolerance. Please provide an Nginx-based load balancing solution.
Assistant: The Nginx-based load balancing solution is as follows: 1. Install and configure the Nginx server, and use the Nginx server as the front-end server to distribute and forward traffic. 2. Deploy multiple backend servers to provide the same service, and start the Nginx server on each server as the backend server. 3. Add the upstream block in the Nginx configuration file, and specify the IP addresses and port numbers of all backend servers, as follows: ``` upstream backend { server 192.168.10.1:80; server 192.168.10.2:80; server 192.168 .10.3:80; } ``` 4. Add the server block in the Nginx configuration file, configure it as a virtual host, and enable port forwarding, as follows: ``` server { listen 80; server_name www.example. com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend/; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ``` 5. You can use the upstream module of Nginx to realize the load balancing function, as follows: ``` upstream backend { ip_hash; server 192.168.10.1:80; server 192.168.10.2:80; server 192.168.10.3:80; } ``` 6. In order to achieve disaster recovery and fault tolerance, data replication and synchronization can be implemented in the backend server, or Use Nginx's backup module to use certain servers as backup servers. When the primary server fails, a backup server is used to take over the service. 7. You can use the Keepalived module of Nginx to implement a high-availability load balancing solution. Keepalived can detect server failures and automatically divert traffic to other servers. 8. Session persistence can be implemented in Nginx to ensure that users can continue to visit on the same server. Session persistence can be achieved using Nginx's sticky module or cookie module. In short, the Nginx-based load balancing solution can ensure high availability, high performance and reliability, and provide good support for business processes of enterprises.
