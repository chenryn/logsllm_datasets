### Summary of Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:09:00 to 18:09:06 on October 18th, documents several issues related to address changes and lease renewals in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple address changes were detected for the server at `msra-sa-41:9000` and `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The old address was `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` and `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030`, respectively.
   - The new address is simply `msra-sa-41:9000` and `msra-sa-41:8030`.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component failed to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` multiple times.
   - Each failure occurred with an increasing duration (from 243 to 248 seconds).
   - The system will retry shortly after each failure.

3. **Connection Retries to Resource Manager (RM)**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempted to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030` multiple times.
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between attempts.
   - Each attempt to connect to the RM resulted in an error.

  - **Address Change**: Detected for both `msra-sa-41:8030` and `msra-sa-41:9000`.
  - **Lease Renewal Failure**: Failed to renew the lease for 244 seconds.

- **18:09:02**:

  - **Lease Renewal Failure**: Failed to renew the lease for 248 seconds.

- **18:09:06**:
  - **Connection Retry**: Attempted to connect to `msra-sa-41:8030` (third retry).

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with address changes and lease renewals, which are causing repeated failures and retries. The system is configured to retry connections up to 10 times with a 1-second interval between attempts. The consistent errors suggest a potential network or configuration issue that needs to be addressed.
