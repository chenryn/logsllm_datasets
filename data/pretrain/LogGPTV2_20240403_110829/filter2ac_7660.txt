**ATT&CK ID:** G0037  
**Technique Name:** FIN6

FIN6 has employed various tools to exploit Windows vulnerabilities for privilege escalation. Specifically, these tools targeted the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs):

- **CVE-2013-3660**: This vulnerability could allow local users to gain kernel-level privileges.
- **CVE-2011-2005**: Similarly, this vulnerability could also enable local users to escalate their privileges to the kernel level.
- **CVE-2010-4398**: This flaw, if exploited, would also permit local users to access kernel-level privileges.

By leveraging these vulnerabilities, FIN6 aims to gain elevated access on compromised systems, facilitating further malicious activities. [19]
