User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Subversion COPY/MOVE - File not found: transaction 'XXX-XX' I'm attempting to create a branch in one of my subversion repositories and keep running into an error. No mater what is done, I keep getting the following:


  File not found: transaction '3062-2e6', path '/Software/XXXXXX/branches/testbranch'


I've noticed that the first part of the '3063-3e6' in the above message is the last successful committed revision in the repository. My apache logs don't give much more information:

[Wed Nov 24 14:10:38 2010] [error] [client x.x.x.x] Could not MOVE/COPY /svn/p070361/!svn/bc/3049/Software/SXXXXXX/trunk.  [404, #0]
[Wed Nov 24 14:10:38 2010] [error] [client x.x.x.x] Unable to make a filesystem copy.  [404, #160013]
[Wed Nov 24 14:10:38 2010] [error] [client x.x.x.x] File not found: transaction '3059-2e2', path '/Software/XXXXXX/branches/testbranch'  [404, #160013]


This is all happening on a server with an nginx frontend that proxies to Apache for the subversion bits. Other repositories are able to branch fine and I was able to create the branch using file:/// from the command line on the server this is occurring on. The permissions on this repository match every other repository and disk space is not an issue.

Assistant: Probably your svn structure has no "Software/XXXXXX/branches" directory, it must exists in order to create "testbranch" here. You should make this directory ("branches") by hands and then do a branch.
