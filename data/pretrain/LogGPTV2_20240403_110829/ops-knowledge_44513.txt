User: In twisted, getProcessOutput method could get 'ps' shell command ouput by using getProcessOutupt('ps', 'aux') and return a defer.
my question is how to run command like "ps aux | grep 'some keyword' | awk '{...}'" in getProcessOutput. for example getProcessOutput("ps aux | grep 'some keyword' | awk '{...}'").
any suggestions would be appreciated.
Assistant: use getProcessOutput('/bin/sh', ('-c', cmd)). cmd is your shell command. try it :-)
