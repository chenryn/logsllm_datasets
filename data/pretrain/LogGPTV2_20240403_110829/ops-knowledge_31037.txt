User: I use Tornado(a python framework) to develope websites, but it often pops me the OSError - too many open files error during high concurrency tests.
One way to solve this is to set the FD limit to a higher number.
What are the cons, or disadvantages of setting a high FD limit? Can I set it arbitrarily to, like 99999999?
Assistant: It's safe to set it quite high. Usually the default for desktop OS is quite low. The main disadvantage is the extra memory that is allocated
