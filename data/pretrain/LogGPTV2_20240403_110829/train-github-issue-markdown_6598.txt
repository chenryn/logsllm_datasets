### Issue: `TOSTRING()` Fails in Cases Where `STR()` Works

**Neo4j Version:** 2.3.1  
**Operating System:** Ubuntu 14.10

#### Steps to Reproduce

I have a collection of arrays defined as follows:
```cypher
Collect([TOINT(idn), STR(name), TOINT(status), TOINT(days_norm), TOINT(days_spent)]) AS flowsteps
```

The following query works correctly:
```cypher
REDUCE (x=0, i IN flowsteps | x + TOINT(STR(i[3]))) AS normP
```

However, the following query throws an error:
```cypher
REDUCE (x=0, i IN flowsteps | x + TOINT(TOSTRING(i[3]))) AS normP
```

**Error Message:**
```
Cypher error: Type mismatch: expected Float, Integer or String but was Any
(line 33, column 57 (offset: 1271)) " REDUCE (x=0, i IN flowsteps | x + TOINT(TOSTRING(i[3]))) AS normP"
```

The same error can be observed with this query:
```cypher
UNWIND [1, "12", 37, "27654"] AS elt
RETURN toString(elt)
```

#### Expected Behavior

`TOSTRING()` should accept any data type, similar to how `STR()` does. This would ensure consistency and avoid the type mismatch error.
