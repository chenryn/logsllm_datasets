TOSTRING() fails in cases where STR() worked
**Neo4j Version:** 2.3.1  
**Operating System:** Ubuntu 14.10
### Steps to reproduce
I have an collection of arrays
`Collect([TOINT(idn),STR(name),TOINT(status),TOINT(days_norm),TOINT(days_spent)])
as flowsteps``
This
`REDUCE (x=0, i IN flowsteps | x + TOINT(STR(i[3]))) as normP`
works, but this
REDUCE (x=0, i IN flowsteps | x + TOINT(TOSTRING(i[3]))) as normP`
throws an error
`Cypher error: Type mismatch: expected Float, Integer or String but was Any
(line 33, column 57 (offset: 1271)) " REDUCE (x=0, i IN flowsteps | x +
TOINT(TOSTRING(i[3]))) as normP`
Same error can be observed when running this:
`UNWIND [1,"12",37,"27654"] as elt RETURN toString(elt)``
### Expected behavior
TOSTRING() should accept Any, like STR() dis
