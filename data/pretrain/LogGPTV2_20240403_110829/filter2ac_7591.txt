### Title: Botconf 2022 - Smoke and Fire: Historical Changes and Trends of Smokeloader

**Abstract:**

Smokeloader, also known as Sharik or SmokeBot, celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2021. Few malware families have managed to survive for a decade without being dismantled by law enforcement or collapsing under their own weight. Over the past ten years, Smokeloader has been a key component in the distribution schemes of many high-profile, financially motivated malware families, including Dridex, Trickbot, ISFB, and SilentNight. Its simplicity and business model have been instrumental in its longevity.

This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Smokeloader's evolution, focusing on three main areas:
1. **Technical Overview:** A detailed analysis of the key changes and updates implemented over the past decade.
2. **Statistical Insights:** Data on the customer base and infrastructure that have supported Smokeloader's operations.
3. **Survival Tactics:** An exploration of the strategies and tactics that have enabled Smokeloader to remain operational and evade detection for so long.
