### Title: Off-Path Attacks Against PKI in the EU-18

The security of Internet-based applications fundamentally relies on the trustworthiness of Certificate Authorities (CAs). In this study, we present, for the first time, a practical demonstration that even a relatively weak attacker, specifically an off-path attacker, can effectively undermine the trustworthiness of popular, commercially used CAs. Our attack targets CAs that use Domain Validation (DV) to authenticate domain ownership, which collectively control 99% of the certificate market.

The attack exploits DNS cache poisoning to trick the CA into issuing fraudulent certificates for domains that the attacker does not legitimately own. These fraudulent certificates bind the attacker's public key to the victim's domain, thereby compromising the integrity of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

We discuss both short-term and long-term defenses but argue that they are insufficient to fully secure DV. To address these threats, we propose Domain Validation++ (DV++), a new method that replaces the need for cryptographic assumptions with those in distributed systems. DV++ retains the benefits of DV, such as automation, efficiency, and low costs, while providing robust security even against Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attackers.

Deployment of DV++ is straightforward and does not require changes to the existing infrastructure or systems of the CAs. We demonstrate the security of DV++ under realistic assumptions and provide open-source access to our implementation.
