Our participant demographics is also well-aligned with prior
neuroimaging security studies [7], [8], [32], [34]. Each partic-
ipant was paid $10 upon completion.
Task Execution Phase: To execute the experiment, we used
two dedicated computers, one in which the experimental task
was presented and the task responses and the response times
were logged, namely stimuli computer, and the other in which
fNIRS data measured during the experiment was recorded,
namely data collection computer. We synchronized the data
between these two computers by placing a marker in the fNIRS
data at the beginning of the task.
We recorded hemodynamic responses, the rapid delivery
of blood to active neuronal tissues [23], in the frontal cortex
and the temporoparietal cortex on both hemispheres using
fNIRS system developed by Hitachi Medical (ETG 4000) in
our experiment. These areas cover the brain regions activated
in previous studies [33], [34] (see Section II-C). We took
the measurement of each participant’s head to determine the
best size of probe cap that would ﬁt the participant. The
fNIRS optodes were then placed on participant’s head using
fNIRS probe cap which ensured standardized sensor placement

optode distance was set to 30mm and the data was acquired
at the frequency of 10Hz. Figure 4 depicts the experimental
set-up used in our study.

instructions were shown on the stimuli computer’s screen. Audio was played
back through external PC speakers (not shown in the ﬁgure).
Calibration is needed to ensure the quality of the data
recorded is good. The participant was then moved to the stimuli
computer for performing the speaker voice recognition task.
Next, the participants were instructed on the tasks they were
performing in our study. They were asked to use the mouse
to enter the responses and were requested to minimize the
body movements during the experiment. The participants then
performed the task discussed in Section III-B.
In our study, we recorded the changes in the concentra-
tion of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated
hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) through the fNIRS device, and task
performance metrics (response and response times) while the
participants performed the tasks as the repeated measures of
our study.
IV. ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
In this section, we provide the steps we followed to
process the neural signals for our analysis. We also provide
an overview of the statistical tests we conducted on our data.
A. Neural Data Processing
Raw light intensity fNIRS data collected in the experiment
were processed to remove high-frequency noise and motion
artifacts using Hitachi’s data acquisition software. A bandpass
ﬁlter saving the frequencies between .5 and .01 Hz was used
to attenuate signatures representing respiratory and cardiac
ﬂuctuations. We used the modiﬁed Beer-Lambert law [14] to
transform the resulting light intensity data into relative con-
centration changes of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and
deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) [40]. We then designed
an in-house software to extract the average oxy-Hb and average
deoxy-Hb from each channel for each trial (15 second voice
sample) presented in the experimental task.
The hemoglobin is called oxy-Hb when it
transports
oxygen to cerebral tissue and is called deoxy-Hb when it
releases oxygen after metabolism. The difference in oxyHb
7
and deoxyHb concentrations at the baseline (rest) and the task
performance is said to determine the location in the cortex of
where activities are happening [27].
The signal measured by each channel was related to the part
of the brain above which the channel was placed. These fNIRS
channels were virtually registered onto the stereotactic brain
coordinate system using Tsuzuki’s 3D-digitizer free method
[39]. This method allowed us to place a virtual optode holder
on the scalp by registering optodes and channels onto reference
brains. We then identiﬁed the brain area represented by each
channel and grouped these channels based on the majority
of the Brodmann Area [9] they covered. We considered
ﬁve broadman areas, namely, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
orbitofrontal gyrus, frontopolar area, superior temporal gyrus
and middle temporal gyrus, found to be activated in previous
studies [25], [33], [34] for real-fake artifacts to measure
differences in neural activities between real and fake voices.
These areas are referred as our regions of interest (ROIs).
As mentioned in III-B, the hypothesis of our study was that
the areas related to decision making, trust, working-memory,
and familiarity will have different activations for real and fake
voices as well, similar to other real-fake artifacts, like paintings
and websites. The oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb measured by the
channels in each group was then separately averaged for each
trial.
B. Statistical Tests
We used IBM SPSS [36] for the purpose of statistical
analysis reported in our study. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test used
for normality detection revealed that oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb
data were non-normal. Thus, Friedman’s test and Wilcoxon
Singed-Rank Test (WSRT) were used for measuring differ-
ences in the means of different groups of trials underlying
our analysis. Following the correction methodology adopted
in [33], and since our analysis focused on pre-established
ROIs per our hypotheses, the comparisons at each of the ROI
were considered separately and were corrected using Holm-
√
bonferroni correction [1]. We also report the effect size of
WSRT which was calculated using the formula r = Z/
N ,
where Z is the value of the z-statistic and N is the number of
observations on which Z is based. Cohen criteria [12] reports
effect size > .1 as small, > .3 as medium and > .5 as large.
V. TASK PERFORMANCE RESULTS
To recall, in our experimental task, participants were asked
to answer if the voice trial played was of the “real” speaker or a
“fake” speaker. We had logged the participants’ responses and
response times during the experiment. A participant’s response
was marked as correct
if she had identiﬁed the original
speaker’s voice as real, and the other speakers’ (morphed and
different speaker) voice as fake. We then calculated the average
accuracy and response time (RTime) the participants spent on
providing answers for each type of trial. Accuracy is deﬁned
as the ratio of the total number of correctly identiﬁed instances
to the total number of samples presented to each participant.
From Table V, we observe that the overall accuracy of
correctly identifying the voice of the speaker is around 64%
which is only slightly better than the random guessing (50%).
It seems highest for the original speaker and the lowest for

the morphed speakers. Also, we notice that the participants
reported 58% of the morphed speakers and 33% of different
speakers as real speakers. This shows that the morphed speak-
ers were more successful than the different speakers in voice
impersonation attacks. Our results are in line with the task
performance results of voice impersonation attacks reported
by Mukhopadhyay et al. [30].
The Friedman’s test showed a statistically signiﬁcant differ-
ence in mean accuracies across original, morphed and different
speaker voices (χ2(20)=17.71, p<.0005). On further contrast-
ing the accuracy rates across different types of trials with
WSRT, we found that the participants identiﬁed original voices
with a statistically signiﬁcantly higher accuracy than morphed
voices (p<.001) with large effect size (r=.76), and identiﬁed
different speaker’s voices with statistically signiﬁcantly higher
accuracy than morphed voices (p<.0005) with a large effect
size (r=.78). We did not see other statistically signiﬁcant
results.
The users failing to identify morphed voices shows the
quality of the converted voice generated by the morphing
engine. The morphed voices might have sounded so similar
to the original speaker’s voice that
the participants failed
to identify them most of the times. This suggests that the
attacker with a sophisticated tech speech morphing engine
may successfully launch voice impersonation attacks on users,
which is a concern to the security and privacy community.
VI. NEURAL RESULTS
In this section, we analyze the neural activations when
users are listening to the original, morphed, and different
speakers voice with the baseline (rest condition), and with
respect to each other.
A. Voice Trial vs. Rest Trial
To recall, in our experimental task, participants were in-
structed to identify the voice of the speaker when played back
and to relax when the rest sign was displayed. To evaluate
the brain areas activated when participants were listening to
original, morphed and different speakers, we contrasted the
brain activation during these trials with the rest trial as a
ground truth. This analysis provided the neural signatures of
detecting the legitimacy of speakers.
We ran Wilcoxon-Signed Rank Tests (WSRT) to evaluate
the differences in mean oxy-Hb and mean deoxy-Hb at each
regions of Interest (ROIs) between the original trial vs. the rest
trialVI. We found statistically signiﬁcant differences in oxy-Hb
at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontopolar area, superior
temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus for the original
speaker trial than the rest trial (such differences are listed in
Table VI, rows 1-4 and Figure 5(a)). Statistically signiﬁcant
differences in deoxy-Hb at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
frontopolar area, middle temporal gyrus and orbitofrontal area
for the original vs.
rest trial (Table VI, rows 5-8) was also
observed.
