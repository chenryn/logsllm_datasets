# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Add Support for multiple saved layouts in Keyboard Manager. E. g. I have a
mapping for my Apple Keyboard where my Alt and Meta keys are swapped and I
have a different mapping for my normal keyboard where I for example have Media
Keys on F13 and up.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
I would like to have like a list of different mappings. If I create a new
mapping, I can choose to save it. The option to rename mappings would be great
to. If it is possible to automatically swap to ta specified mapping if I
connect a special keyboard, I would find that great to. But that is optional
if it is to hard / time consuming to implement.
# Conclusion
  * Add option to save mappings
  * Saved mappings are available in list
  * (Optional) Automatically switch to mapping XY if special Keyboard is plugged in.
