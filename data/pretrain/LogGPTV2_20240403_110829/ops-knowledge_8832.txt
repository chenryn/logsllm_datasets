User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释如下是一些常见的日志
 0 20:10:57 INFO Reading broadcast variable 33 took 9 ms
 1 20:10:55 INFO Reading broadcast variable 26 took 10 ms
 2 20:10:56 INFO Reading broadcast variable 31 took 8 ms
 3 20:10:54 INFO Reading broadcast variable 21 took 11 ms
 4 20:10:55 INFO Reading broadcast variable 25 took 11 ms
日志最前面三部分别为序号、时间戳和日志Level，在不考虑这三部分内容的情况下，此处我们设定日志的变量用'<*>'代替，token与token之间用空格分隔，那么请问上述日志的日志模版具体是什么？

A: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT]
B: Reading broadcast variable <*> took <*> ms
C: Changing modify acls to: <*>
D: Changing view acls to: <*>

Assistant: Answer: B
