When you try to write a zip file larger than 4 GB with numpy's savez you get
an exception saying that you should enable ZIP64 extensions.  
I did not find any way (without altering the numpy code manually and
reinstalling numpy) to make this possible. From my point of view, this is a
severe usability bug - as I can not use savez anymore.
Please add a function, e.g. savez64(...) which uses ZIP64 by default or a
function enableZip64(bool) which can turn ZIP64 on or off.
