### Issue Description
When attempting to write a zip file larger than 4 GB using `numpy.savez`, an exception is thrown, indicating that ZIP64 extensions should be enabled. 

I was unable to find a way to enable ZIP64 without manually modifying the numpy code and reinstalling the package. From my perspective, this is a significant usability issue, as it prevents me from using `savez` for large files.

### Suggested Solution
To address this problem, I propose two potential solutions:

1. **Add a new function `savez64(...)`**: This function would use ZIP64 extensions by default, allowing users to save large zip files without encountering the current limitation.
2. **Implement a configuration function `enableZip64(bool)`**: This function would allow users to enable or disable ZIP64 support, providing more flexibility in managing file sizes.

By implementing one of these solutions, the usability of `numpy.savez` for large files would be significantly improved.
