User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Nginx 444 error eqivalent in Apache? Is there any way to produce same Nginx 444 error in apache.

Nginx 


  444--> Connection Closed Without Response.


I like this error since if anyone tries to CURL he gets an empty response, but not so in Apache.

Assistant: 444 is not returned to the client, it is only written into nginx logs signalling that a connection was closed with no response. This same firewall-like behavior can be achieved in apache using modsecurity and DROP actions.
