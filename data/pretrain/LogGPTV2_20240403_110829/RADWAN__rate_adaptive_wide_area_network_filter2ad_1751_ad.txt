tion format as the amount of signal attenuation increases (shown with
dotted vertical lines).
5.3 Evaluating Modulation Change
We demonstrate the capability of RADWAN to react to SNR
degradation by reducing the modulation format of ports,
allowing links with reduced signal quality to function at
lower rates. In this section we provide an end-to-end
evaluation of RADWAN as it attempts to meet changing
demand matrices by upgrading the capacities of links in the
WAN. Additionally, we show that RADWAN migrates flows
from a link undergoing capacity up-/downgrade (due to
improved/poor SNR) to alternate paths until the modulation
change is complete.

Figure 7(a) shows the starting
state of our testbed where the network is carrying three flows
of 100 Gbps, two from Node C to D (C−D−1 , C−D−1) and
one from Node B to A (B−A−2). All links in the network can
carry 200 Gbps of traffic. Observe that the Rx rate in
Figure 7(d) matches the Tx rate, implying there is no packet
loss. Now, we attenuate the signal between Node A and B
using a VOA device such that the switch ports can no longer
sustain transmission at 200 Gbps. Therefore, the link goes
down (Figure 7(b)), causing (B−A−2) to get routed over the
longer path B→C→D→A which is configured as the backup
route. This transition of the B−A−2 flow along the longer
path is visible in the utilization of links in the network
(Figure 7(d)). Links B−C and D−A now are carrying 100
Gbps of the B−A−2 flow (therefore are 50% utilized). Note
that this leads to congestion on link C−D which can only
carry 200 Gbps of traffic and thus drops 100 Gbps of traffic
from C−D flows. The RADWAN controller can mitigate this
congestion by reducing the modulation format of A−B link to
QPSK from 16QAM. It takes roughly one minute for the
modulation change to take effect as observed in the down
status of link A−B in Figure 7(d). Once the modulation
change is complete, link A−B is back up and carries the
B−A−2 flow without any congestion in the network (Tx/Rx
rates match again). The new network state is shown in
Figure 7(c). Therefore, our experiments show that RADWAN
can react to traffic demands and signal quality by adapting
the capacity of links in the WAN.
6 LARGE SCALE EVALUATION
In section §2, we used 3 years of SNR measurements to
demonstrate that an overall capacity gain of 67% is possible
by augmenting the capacity of links from 100 Gbps to 125,
150, 175, or 200 Gbps depending on their average SNR. This
represents the upper bound of the throughput gain achievable
using RADWAN. The actual network throughput depends not
only on the network state (link capacities, tunnels etc.) but
also the traffic demand and acceptable churn (defined in §4).
In this section, we simulate the operation of RADWAN in
a large backbone network with realistic traffic demands to
compute the network throughput achieved by RADWAN. We
compare the throughput and availability of the network under
RADWAN and state-of-the-art SWAN controller.
Both controllers are aware of the underlying signal quality
of links. But unlike SWAN, RADWAN uses the SNR to
update link capacities, choosing amongst discrete choices of
50, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200 Gbps. As outlined in the
previous section, RADWAN only upgrades the capacity of a
link to meet increased traffic demand that cannot be met
otherwise. Capacity downgrades are done to prevent link

(d) Reaction of RADWAN to poor SNR on B−A
Figure 7: (a) describes the starting network state and link capacities. At
the start, all links are in 16QAM modulation format, capable of carry-
ing 200 Gbps. There are three flows in the network, each of 100 Gbps.
One from B→A and two from C→D. Due to signal attenuation, the link
A−B fails as seen in (b), causing the B−A−2 flow to get routed over the
longer path B→C→D→A. Observe that the utiilization of links B−C
and D−A increases in (d). This causes link C−D to get congested and
it drops parts of the C−D−1 , C−D−2 flows (Tx rate falls below the Rx
rate in (d)). RADWAN reacts to this situation by reducing the modula-
tion format of link A−B to QPSK as is allowed by the lowered SNR of
the link (see (c)). Once the modulation change completes, all flows are
routed along direct paths without any packet loss as confirmed by the
Tx/Rx rates and link utlizations in (d).
failures such that the lower quality link can continue to
function at a reduced rate.
6.1 Simulation Setup
We consider the network topology of a large commercial
WAN and gather SNR measurements from the optical fiber
connecting the nodes in the topology for four randomly
chosen days in the years 2016 and 2017. Both RADWAN and
SWAN compute flow allocations along various network paths
to meet an elastic demand between each pair of nodes in the
network.
Since WANs operate links at 100 Gbps currently, we con-
sider the performance of SWAN in a fixed capacity network
where each link operates at 100 Gbps if the SNR is above the
threshold of 100 Gbps modulation and otherwise the link is
down. We refer to this scheme as SWAN-100 in the analysis.
However, operators can be more aggressive with respect to

We also compare SWAN’s performance with fixed capacity links operating with static 150 Gbps higher modulation format. While SWAN-150 provides
an improvement over SWAN-100, RADWAN achieves 12% higher throughput than SWAN-150. (c) Average per link throughput. We observe that

utilizing the network by operating links at fixed but higher ca-
pacity of 150 Gbps. We refer to SWAN operating in such a
network as SWAN-150. SWAN-150 is used to compare the
benefit of using rate adaptive schemes like RADWAN over
a network with higher but fixed link capacities. While hard-
ware limitations prevent hitless capacity changes presently,
we simulate the performance of RADWAN under both hitless
(RADWAN-HITLESS) and non-hitless (RADWAN) link ca-
pacity change behavior.
The traffic demand between each node pair varies
periodically every two minutes (demand pattern shown in
Figure 8(a)). Our choice of network demands is similar to
previous work [15] since rapid changes in demand matrices
stress test the TE controllers. We also offset the traffic
demand between each pair of nodes by a randomized value to
ensure that at any given point of time, there is sufficient
variety of demands in the network.
Simulation Parameters. Unless otherwise stated,
the
control loop of both controllers is executed every 30 seconds
as stated in [15]. In addition, we assume that the demand
between each pair of nodes can be split across k = 2 shortest
paths between the nodes. For RADWAN, we set the churn
trade-off parameter ϵ (defined in §4) to a conservative value
of 0.001. We perform several runs of this experiment with
each run lasting for one day. We find that across four
randomly chosen days, our results are similar. Hence, for the
sake of brevity,
the figures show results from one
experimental run.
6.2 Evaluation Metrics
We focus on the following three key aspects of effective, cost-
efficient network design to evaluate RADWAN.
10
Network Throughput. First, we compute the optimal
network flow that RADWAN can achieve in each run of the
controller and compare it with the optimal flow that SWAN
achieves for the same network conditions. This provides the
network throughput enabled by both controllers for each run
of their control loops for the duration of a day. Figure 8(b)
shows the network flow for both RADWAN and SWAN for
two hours of a day (zooming into two consecutive hours,
picked randomly for the sake of better visibility in the figure).
We observe that RADWAN manages to push 40% more
traffic than SWAN-100 in the same network. The same
observation holds consistently with other hours and days we
simulated. We note that while RADWAN
Link Throughput. Next, we compare RADWAN and
SWAN’s per link throughput. For each run of the TE control
loop, we compute the total traffic carried by each link and
average it over all links in the network. Figure 8(c) shows the
distribution of average link throughput over time (again
zoomed over two hours for better visibility). We find that, on
average, RADWAN increases the utilization of network links
by 68% compared to SWAN-100, getting more utility from
each link in the network.
Link Availability. We compute the availability of links
under each TE scheme as the fraction of total simulation time
for which the link was up for carrying traffic. Figure 9(a)
compares the average availability of links in the simulation
period. As expected, RADWAN-HITLESS allows links to be
100% available since it instantly adapts the link capacity to
the lower or higher SNR. RADWAN has slightly lower link
availability since capacity changes are not hitless and cause
the links undergoing capacity changes to be unavailable for

roughly one minute. However, we note that RADWAN pro-
vides better availability over the state-of-the-art SWAN-100
scheme. This is because RADWAN adapts links to lower
capacities in place of failing them when the signal quality
degrades. Even though capacity reconfigurations done by
RADWAN are not hitless, we note that the link availability
under RADWAN does not suffer much since very few links
undergo rapid changes in capacity (as seen in Figure 9b).
7 DISCUSSION
In this section, we provide insights on future directions of
hitless capacity change as well as a discussion on cost and the
impact of capacity change on distances the light can travel.
7.1 Hitless Capacity Change
BVTs and dependency graphs. Dependency graphs [19,
21] are one of the seminal techniques used for consistent
network updates [9]. By specifying an old and a new network
state, each individual routing change is performed only when
safe to do so. However, when a link e is to be modulated, with
a flow f utilizing e before and after the link flap, dependency
graphs perform poorly: no alternative path is specified for f .
RADWAN manages link flaps by computing an interme-
diate routing state for flows during reconfiguration. As such,
RADWAN specifies a two-step dependency graph: in order
for a scheduled link flap to be activated, the affected traffic is
rerouted beforehand. 3 Due to the benevolent nature of SNR
in our 3 year data set of 2,000 links, coupled with the churn
minimization of Algorithm 1, RADWAN jointly activates all
3OWAN [18] also deals with consistent cross-layer reconfiguration in WANs.
However, OWAN is designed for Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multi-
plexers, where wavelengths are exclusively either activated or deactivated:
link flaps due to BVTs are not considered.

we demonstrate ways to change the modulation efficiently, such that it
takes only 35 milliseconds, on average.
link flaps. In more volatile SNR scenarios, RADWAN can be
set to activate link flaps over multiple dependent iterations.
We conjecture that such intermediate consistency methods
can eventually be phased out once hitless capacity changes
become production ready, as discussed in the next section.
Towards hitless capacity change. BVTs are not yet
optimized to handle the latency of a modulation change.
State-of-the-art BVTs can only change the link modulation
after bringing the module to a lower power state. This
translates to a link flap for higher layer protocols. The
duration of such link failures is a challenge in the
deployment of dynamic capacity links in production
networks. To quantify this, we obtain an evaluation board to
the Acacia AC400 bandwidth variable transceiver [1].. This
module is essentially the same as the one integrated in the
switch linecard used as part of our testbed in Section 5. Since
the evaluation board exposes an API to program the
transceiver, we use it for understanding the modulation
change procedure. We change the link’s modulation 200
times from QPSK to 16QAM and analyze the time taken.
Figure
10b shows the AC400 bandwidth variable
transceiver module. We observe that the average downtime of
the link undergoing capacity change is 68 seconds, similar to
