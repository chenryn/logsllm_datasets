 **Context:**
  * Playwright Version: 1.0.2
  * Operating System: Windows 10
  * Node version: 13.12, 14.0, 14.2
  * Browser: All
**Code Snippet**
Using the snippet from getting started:
    const { chromium, firefox, webkit } = require('playwright');
    (async () => {
      try {
        const browser = await chromium.launch();
        // const browser = await firefox.launch();
        // const browser = await webkit.launch();
        const page = await browser.newPage();
        await page.goto('http://whatsmyuseragent.org/');
        await page.screenshot({ path: `example.png` });
        await browser.close();
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    })();
**Describe the bug**  
In an existing project (that had Cypress installed, not sure if that's
relevant), I ran `npm i playwright` (in Windows Terminal/PowerShell), then ran
`npm audit fix` (I got distracted) and noticed that Cypress re-ran some
things. Then I ran the snippet above, and it failed for all three browsers.
I uninstalled Cypress, deleted `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` and ran
`npm i` again. Still all three failed. I switched from Node 14.0 to 13.12
(using nvm windows, if that's relevant) and tried again, all three failed,
switched to Node 14.2 and now webkit and firefox work (although I admit I'm
maybe changing more than one variable between attempts).
My directory `C:\Users\david\AppData\Local\ms-
playwright\chromium-764964\chrome-win` contains only a single file,
`84.0.4135.0.manifest`. Its contents are:
I have Chrome and Chrome Canary (and Edge and Edge Canary) installed on my
machine, not sure if that makes a difference.
With Node 14.2 I created a brand new project, installed only `playwright`, and
it failed for chromium but works for firefox and webkit.
Then I deleted `C:\Users\david\AppData\Local\ms-playwright` and started all
over again with Node 14.2 and everything worked. This seems to indicate that
during install something is checking if the `ms-playwright` directory is
there, but not checking that its contents are correct.
Lastly, I went back to how (I thought) I started out. Node 13.2, deleted
`C:\Users\david\AppData\Local\ms-playwright`, and ran `npm i playwright` again
and everything worked fine. So after all that I can't pinpoint a specific
scenario, but hopefully some of the above is useful in ironing out install
kinks.
May I suggest that when running, you check that the correct assets are
available and install them if necessary?
Maybe this is a duplicate of #1992 or #1988 or #1085, but they seem different
enough that I'll create this as a new issue.
