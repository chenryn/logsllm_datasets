  * OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
  * Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
  * TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source, both nightly and 1.12 tried
  * TensorFlow version: 1.12 and nightly
  * Python version: 3.6
  * Installed using virtualenv? pip? conda?: conda environment
  * Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.19.1

**Describe the problem**  
I'm trying to compile from source and I keep running into the same problem
regardless of what release i try to build.
**Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before
running into the problem**  
I followed the guide https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows
promptly. Below is what i get when i try to make the package builder by
running 'bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda
//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package'
**Any other info / logs**
