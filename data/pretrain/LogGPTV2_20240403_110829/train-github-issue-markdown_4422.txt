We should expect this to work, but currently we get an inappropriate error
message.
    >>> from sklearn import *
    >>> model_selection.cross_validate(linear_model.LogisticRegression(), np.random.rand(10, 2), ['no'] * 3 + ['yes'] * 7, scoring='roc_auc')
    ...
    ValueError: Data is not binary and pos_label is not specified
`_binary_clf_curve` is assuming that `pos_label=1` if not specified. But it
should be assuming the same ordering as the classifier, i.e. the greater
string is the positive class label.
