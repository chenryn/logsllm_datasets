User: In the Linux system, how to modify the user's file permissions? What important commands are involved?
Assistant: To modify a user's file permissions, you can use the chmod command. This command is used to change the permissions of files or directories, allowing users, groups or other users to read, write or execute specific files. For example, to set a file's permissions to read-write execute (rwx) user, read and execute (rx) group, and read-only (r) other user, use the following command: ``` chmod u =rwx,g=rx,o=r file.txt ``` In this command, u means user authority, g means group authority, and o means other user authority. =rwx means to set user permissions to read, write and execute, =rx means to set group permissions to read and execute, and r means to set other user permissions to read-only. In addition to the chmod command, there are other commands that can be used to manage file and directory permissions, such as chown, chgrp, umask, etc.
