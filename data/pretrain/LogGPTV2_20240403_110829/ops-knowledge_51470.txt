User: newb here. I am trying to make a c++ program that will read from a named pipe created by python. My problem is, the named pipe created by python uses os.getpid() as part of the pipe name. when i try calling the pipe from c++, i use getpid(). i am not getting the same value from c++. is there a method equivalent in c++ for os.getpid?
thanks!
edit:
sorry, i am actually using os.getpid() to get the session id via ProcessIDtoSessionID(). i then use the session id as part of the pipe name
Assistant: You don't get same proccess IDs because your python program and c++ programs are run in different proccesses thus having different process IDs. So generally use a different logic to name your fifo files.
