○ Read the NDA you signed
○ Does not matter that the APT$ stole it all
● The proper answer: “That information can be 
verified with a conversation with your Personal 
Security Officer.”
Time to Communicate (Hackers)
● Use a professional looking email 
address
○ Don’t send it from 
PI:EMAIL 
○ Caution on Google data mining
○ Best keep personal & work 
email separate
■ GTFG email address
Time to Communicate (Hackers)
● Cover letter
○ Why do you want the role?
○ What role are you applying for? 
○ No letter indicates you are not interested, or 
just spamming applications
○ Just five (5) minutes on why this role sounds 
interesting makes a difference
Use Your Network
● Reach out to your network regarding specific 
companies and roles
○ Social media
■ Even a short note to the recruiter has 
gotten the screening interview
How To Meet Hiring Managers
● Involvement in 
○ Local IT & InfoSec communities/Meetups
○ Mailing lists & forums 
○ Conferences
● Online communities
○ Reddit
○ Closed/vetted InfoSec and DFIR lists, SANS
Working With Recruiters
● There are different types of recruiters
○ Technical recruiters
■ Company

■ Spamming of the PDs
■ Unable to answer follow-up questions
● Do your research on recruiters like you would 
potential companies to work for
○ Build relationships with good ones
Understand the odds
● You could be one of tens or a hundred 
candidates
○ Connect with those involved before the 
search
○ Try to not get discouraged
○ Diversify your applications
○ Location
■ Depth of the labor pool
■ Who else applied for the role
Keep Perspective
● Have patience
● Keep in mind the other 
requirements and stressors the 
hiring managers have

process

peers
Core Problem aka Opportunity #3
THE INTERVIEW
The Interview
The interview process is hard. But when you compound 
that with the nervousness of trying to get a job in your 
“dream field” and the fact that most of us are weird shits 
who do weird shit during the day, the interview can be 
anxiety-inducing. There are a lot of little things that can be 
done by both sides to make it a little bit less awful.
Hiring Managers
● “Stump the monkey” isn’t fun for anyone
○ Trick questions, the Google stumpers
○ Nor does it convey how good of an analyst 
they are or could be
■ How the candidate processing 
information to mitigate the 
threat/risk/vulnerability 
■ Not how fast they can recite knowledge
○ Could dissuade a good candidate from 
accepting an offer
Stump the Monkey
● The intent is to find individuals for your team, 
not prove how smart you are - or how dumb 
they are
○ Lasting impression on you & company
■ See the Glassdoor Interview ratings & 
feedback
○ Sometimes there is more than one answer
■ With the answer different than yours
● See Wheaton’s Law 
https://dontbeadickday.com/

Question Bias
● So what if the candidate does not know how 
to work with oak
○ Can they learn to work with mahogany?
● Avoid close-ended questions
○ “Have you worked with Oak”?
○ “What is the UDP flag on a DNS request 
that fails” 
○ “What protocol uses port 0” 
Toolset Bias
● Best to use situational, exploratory 
conversations
● What are some of the ways you have used 
wood to address vulnerabilities? 
● See: If Carpenters Were Hired Like 
Programmers

Hiring Bias
● Stop passing judgement
○ Piercings and tattoos no longer mean that 
they’re ex-convicts
● Don’t be a dick (Wheaton’s Law)
○ People get nervous and forget things
○ So what if they self-identify as a hacker?
Reviewing resumes & length of time in a 
role
● Why does the length of time in a role matter? 
○ Why this concern on ‘job hopping’? 
○ Most are out of the candidate's control
■ Startups
■ Company failure or change of direction 
■ Contract work
■ Layoff, unemployment
● Put yourself in their place
Reviewing resumes & length of time in a 
role
● Just because unemployed does not make 
them untouchable
○ Put aside your bias
○ Listen to the reason(s) and don’t assume 
they’re excuses
● Discrimination
Reviewing resumes & length of time 
between roles
Not all gaps between jobs should be a (bad) 
reflection on the candidate 
○ Family illnesses
○ School, personal development
○ Recession (yes, there still is one)
○ Personal time, recuperation from last role
■ Toxic work environment/manager
■ “Mourning period” after getting laid off 
from a job/company they really enjoyed 
being a part of (or needed)
The InfoSec Question
● Can the candidate explain how you can 
reduce Risk by affecting Vulnerability, Threat, 
Asset or Cost?
○ Most technical folk focus on Vulnerability. 
○ Most nontechnical folk focus on Threat.
○ We need to reduce Vulnerability and 
Threat, but also work on Cost.
Hiring Excuses
Commonly heard excuses:
● “Not technical enough”
● “Not a cultural fit”
In your team interviews, use a scoring system 
and average the scores to help eliminate bias.
We need to stop using culture fit as a crutch for 
not hiring someone. 
Culture Fit Excuse
● Think about whether you would want to work 
with this individual, but do not use it as an 
excuse when someone ”better” comes along.
● Do you think the person can do the job - or 
can learn? 
● Diversity of the team
○ a good thing.
Trifecta
● Ability to learn (and want to learn skills) 
○ This is critical
● Passion.  What is this person passionate about? 
○ Learning? Figuring things out? Solving 
problems?  That is huge. 
● Ability to be wrong/fail, and to do so well.  We 
will all fail. The key is, if you fail, can you fail 
well? Can you learn and grow from it, or do you 
hide it and try to blame others? 
Hacker Appearance
● Leave the ski mask at home
● Appropriateness 
○ A bank vs. a startup?
○ East or West coast? Southwest?
● In your recon phase, determine the daily 
dress and take it up a notch
Hacker conduct in interview
● Don’t fucking swear
● Watch your personal 
sharing & stories
● Personal hygiene
● Personal space
● Manners still count 
○ With everyone
#pantslessness
Hack the Interview
● Research on company and interviewees
○ Glassdoor
■ Help by leaving reviews, use Bugmenot 
& public WiFi
○ Wikipedia
○ Crunchbase
○ Social media
■ LinkedIn, with your alternate profile & 
proxy
○ Review rating Web sites, GTFG
Knowing Your Target 
● Understand the target organization and hiring 
manager
○ Their product, values 
● Able to explain why & how you are the best 
person for the role and the team at that 
company
● Have your three bullets and stick to them
Hackers Question Everything 
● From your research, have questions to ask them 
○ Get them to sell you the role & the company
○ This is an interview on both sides of the table
■ Would you want to work for the manager?
■ Do you like the company, what they 
produce and stand for? 
Question Everything 
● Have appropriate answers for every InfoSec 
related interview question online
● “I don’t know” is not an answer
○ How would you figure it out?
● Your judgement call on calling out 
interviewers regarding inappropriate 
questions
A Question of Timing 
● Did the interviewees give you enough time to 
ask questions?
○ Or was it the token five minutes at the end 
of their grilling?
○ Was it a conversation between peers, or 
individuals in the industry - or a grilling? 
Core Problem aka Opportunity #4
POST-INTERVIEW
Post-Interview
A lot of folks can not seem to find the balance 
between being aloof about not getting the job 
and acting like overly attached girlfriend. 
Hiring Managers
● Don’t leave people hanging
○ Send an email or call with status updates
○ Contact within 3-4 weeks at maximum
● Provide feedback 
○ If HR will allow
○ Perhaps in a non-official capacity instead?
○ Builds relationships within the community
○ Helps improve the pool of candidates
■ Lets us determine what you need/want
Provide Feedback
● Glaring resume issues/errors
● Topics to review 
○ Tools, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs)
○ Protocols
● Interview tips 
○ Talk more/don’t talk as much
○ Etiquette 
Hackers, Follow Up
● Send a “thank you” email to all you talked and 
interacted with. Consider snail mail card
○ Best not send connection requests on social 
media 
Hackers
● Follow-up
○ When should you reach out if you have not 
heard back?
○ Don’t panic
■ It may take a while to hear back
● Be realistic in your expectations
○ Know the local/regional/national market
Social Network
● Leverage your network to provide insight & 
potential references to the company/hiring 
manager
● How do you get previous supervisors as 
references? 
● DO NOT send social media connection 
requests
○ Creeepy….
● Leave feedback on Glassdoor?
Employers forget that the impression they leave 
on their employees, past & present, influences 
income, rep and biz dev in ways unknown.
