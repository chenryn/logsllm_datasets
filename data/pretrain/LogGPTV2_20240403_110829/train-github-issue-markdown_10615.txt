### Issue Type:
Bug Report

### Ansible Version:
- **Version**: 1.7 (devel `189824d`)
- **Last Updated**: 2014/07/30 17:24:01 (GMT +200)

### Environment:
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary:
The `mount` module in Ansible is not idempotent when using a bind mount with `state=mounted`. It remounts the directory on every run, even if it is already mounted.

### Steps to Reproduce:
```yaml
- name: BIND MOUNT | /usr/local/jdk1.7 -> /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle
  mount:
    name: /usr/local/jdk1.7
    src: /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle
    fstype: none
    opts: bind
    state: mounted
```
(Note: I will not use symlinks for this.)

### Expected Results:
The `mount` module should correctly check the mount status and only execute the mount operation if necessary, ensuring idempotence.

### Actual Results:
When running the playbook multiple times, the `mount` module reports "Changed" each time, and the mount appears multiple times in the `mount` output:

```sh
$ mount
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle on /usr/local/jdk1.7 type none (rw,bind)
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle on /usr/local/jdk1.7 type none (rw,bind)
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle on /usr/local/jdk1.7 type none (rw,bind)
```

This indicates that the mount is being re-executed on each run, rather than being idempotent.
