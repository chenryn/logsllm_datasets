User: I am working on an inventory project for work that will use a mobile computer and have run into a problem. I have written a program using Python and the Gspread library, but forgot to check if it will even work with either the windows mobile or windows CE operating systems. From what I have found there is a version of python for Windows CE but I am not sure if the Gspread library even works with this version of python. 
Has anybody had any experience working with these operating systems or does somebody have a better understanding of python and its libraries? can I just install a library into any version of python?
Assistant: Although gspread source code is available and a python modul it depends on urllib and that depends on various other modules that are not part of PythonCE.
So, I fear, you will not success in getting gspread running on the windows mobile device.
Best solution to this seems to use a web server that hosts the html pages. Apache, for example, can host python code.
OTOS gspread is a warpper for google spread sheet API that can be invoked directly from html javascript code running on windows mobile device. But does a spread sheet make sense on such small displays?
