**Current behavior**  
When using AoT compilation, in particular with the `@ngtools/webpack` plugin,
using `ViewEncapsulation.None` in a component with stylesheets, an error is
raised at runtime, since component styles are _always_ accessed through the
_styles_ exported member, but this only exists when `ViewEncapsulation` is set
to `Emulated`. Because of that, the `_flattenStyles` function received an
array with `undefined` items, and tries to run the `replace` method over it.
**Expected behavior**  
Regardless of which `ViewEncapsulation` is used, compiled styles imports
should not break at runtime.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
  1. Clone and setup https://github.com/blacksonic/angular2-aot-webpack/
  2. Delete _ngfactory_ folder and files
  3. Add `ViewEncapsulation.None` to home.component.s
  4. Run
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
You can take a look at the `style_compiler `source code:
https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/compiler/src/style_compiler.ts#L60.
When in a _component_ context, a variable named _styles_ is used to get the
exported value. However, that variable only exists when a _shim_ is used, but
only happens when `ViewEncapsulation` is `Emulated`.
