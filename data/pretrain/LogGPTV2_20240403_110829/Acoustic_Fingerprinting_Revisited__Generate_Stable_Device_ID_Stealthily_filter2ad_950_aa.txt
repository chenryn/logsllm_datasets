ABSTRACT
The popularity of mobile devices has made people’s lives more
convenient, but threatened people’s privacy at the same time. As
end users are becoming more and more concerned on the protec-
tion of their private information, it is even harder for hackers to
track a speciﬁc user by using conventional technologies. For ex-
ample, cookies might be cleared by users regularly. Besides, OS
designers have developed a series of measures to cope with tracker.
Apple has stopped apps accessing UDIDs, and Android phones use
some special permissions to protect IMEI code. However, some re-
cent studies showed that attackers are able to ﬁnd new ways to get
around those limitations, even though these new methods should
be improved in order to be practically deployed in large scale. For
example, attackers can trace smart phones by using the hardware
features resulting from the imperfect manufacturing process of ac-
celerometers. In this paper, we will present another new and more
practical method for the adversaries to generate stable and unique
device ID stealthily for the smartphone by exploiting the frequency
response of the speaker. With carefully selected audio frequencies
and special sound wave patterns, we can reduce the impact of non-
linear effects and noises, and keep our feature extraction process
un-noticeable to phone owners. The extracted feature is not only
very stable for a given smart phone, but also unique to that phone.
The feature contains rich information, which is even enough to dif-
ferentiate millions of smart phones of the same model. We have
built a prototype to evaluate our method, and the results show that
the generated device ID can be used to track users practically.

INTRODUCTION
Smart phones are playing an increasingly important role in our
daily lives, including both work and personal entertainment, which
makes the security of smart phones, especially the protection of
user privacy, a very important and urgent problem. Smart phone
sales are experiencing nearly 40% increasing year on year reported
by IDC[8]. However, according to F-secure, a continued 49% rais-
ing of mobile threat was witnessed in the last quarter, and 91.3% of
them targeted at Android platform, the most popular mobile operat-
ing system today[4]. Different from traditional desktop PCs, smart
phones often contain more private and sensitive information, like
SMS, contacts, location, etc. And studies showed that such sensi-
tive data is the major reason why smart phones are so attractive to
attackers [43].
Fortunately, people are becoming better educated to know how
to protect their privacy. Statistics from Pew Internet Project show
that almost 90% of adult Internet users have taken steps to avoid
surveillance by other people or organizations, like clearing cook-
ies, encrypting email, and using aliases [2]. To attract users, ma-
jor browsers now support various privacy protection features, like
“Don’t Track”, third party cookie disabling, etc. Governments and
organizations are also working on laws to protect users’ privacy.
However, being able to track users is really proﬁtable in many
applications, whether it is used legitimately or maliciously. So,
it is not surprising to see that many big companies declare plans
to give up using cookie on one side, and work on new tracking
technologies on the other side [6]. There are also many studies on
the stop-tracking and new tracking technologies in the academia
world [36, 32, 39, 28, 41, 29, 35].
Among these new tracking technologies, some suggested to use
device IDs when cookie is absent [11], mainly because that de-
vice IDs are straightforward and cannot be wiped or reset easily.
Typically, many things can be used as device IDs, such as UDID
(Unique Device ID) from Apple, IMEI for general mobile phones,
Android ID for Android phones, MAC addresses of Wi-Fi and Eth-
ernet network interfaces or Bluetooth modules [40], and so on.
Some recent researches also suggested to construct device IDs by
using hardware features resulted from imperfect manufacture pro-
cess, like accelerometers [21] and speakers [19].
But each of these new methods has its own limitations, thus their
potential threat could be under-estimated. On one hand, system
vendors can easily block the access of a device ID by removing rel-
evant APIs, and on the other hand, some newly discovered device
IDs are not mature enough to be deployed in real world production
scenarios. For example, Apple ceased the use of UDID recently [3],
and on Android, accessing IMEI requires a special permission that
could be revoked by Google if necessary (actually, Google made
changes to Android permission system from time to time, and re-
429cently, they just revoked the permission on SD card writing [1],
so there is no guarantee that they would not remove the permis-
sions granting related to IMEI and other possible device IDs). For
newly discovered device IDs, like those extracted from accelerom-
eters and speakers, the false positive rates are still too high, and
they are not stable and robust enough to give unique IDs to large
volume of devices (more details are given in section 8).
To raise an alarm on such alternative user-tracking methods, in
this paper we will propose another device ID generation method
that is more practical by reaching following requirements better:
uniqueness, robustness, and stealthiness. Our basic idea is to lever-
age frequency responses of speakers on smart phones as hardware-
based identiﬁcation. But our techniques are totally different from
previous work and can improve the ﬁnal results dramatically.
One of our fundamental difference to previous work is the use
of high frequency sound. In previous work [19], a piece of mu-
sic is played, and since its frequency range is normally lower than
10 kHz, it can be easily heard by the smart phone owner. What’s
more, the majority of environmental noises also fall into this range,
which makes the feature extraction difﬁcult and unstable.
By contrast, our method uses audio frequency that is higher than
14 kHz, which is chosen after careful studies of various factors, in-
cluding the environment noises, characteristics of human hearing,
as well as the manufacturing technologies of speakers. For exam-
ple, as shown by our experiments in section 5, in most cases, there
are less noises in higher frequency range. What’s more, studies
of human hearing indicate that our ears are much less sensitive to
sound with higher frequency, which means that people can easily
hear a sound with 4 kHz at 30 dB, but can hardly perceive another
16 kHz sound at the same 30 dB (more details in section 3).
More importantly, we have found that speakers’ performances
are much more diversiﬁed at higher frequency range, which helped
us be able to get unique feature for each of them with negligible
false positive and false negative rates.
Ideally, we would expect
each speaker performs in the same way. However, this is impos-
sible in real world, so, manufacturers have to optimize speakers
with trade-offs among the cost, manufacturing technology, and the
perception of human ears. As mentioned above, people are more
sensitive to low frequency audio, so the speaker manufacturers fo-
cus on the optimization at lower frequency range ﬁrst, and optimize
higher frequency range later only if cost/budget permits. As a re-
sult, it is not surprising that the frequency response curves are sim-
ilar at lower frequency range, but differ to each other dramatically
at higher frequency range (more details will be given in section 3).
Another fundamental difference to previous work is that we con-
struct audio stimulus pattern carefully to minimize the impact of
non-linear characteristics of speakers and background noises. In-
stead of playing a piece of random chosen music, as was done in
previous work, we choose to output a stable combination of about
seventy different frequencies, and later when extracting features,
only analyze response at these frequency points. So, noises not on
those frequency points can be ﬁltered, and more importantly, the
speaker can work in a stable state with its features being exposed
steadily and completely. We believe that such design is crucial to
get unique and robust device ID.
Contributions. We summarize our contributions as follows:
• We carefully analyzed many different factors that could af-
fect the construction of unique and robust device ID from
mobile phone speakers, and proposed to use high frequency
sound with special frequency pattern as stimulation to speak-
ers, which can not only make the whole process unnoticeable
by the smart phone owners, but also can minimize the impact
of background noises and non-linear features.
• We developed novel algorithms to extract and match features
from the recorded speaker responses, which is built on self-
correlation and cross-correlation functions, instead of using
complex machine learning algorithm. We also developed a
method to estimate the potential false positive and false neg-
ative rates.
• We built a prototype and performed a comprehensive evalu-
ation over the proposed method, and the results showed that
the extracted device ID is very stable, with negligible false
positive and false negative rates.
Roadmap. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We list
required assumptions and adversary models in Section 2 and then
give an overview of our proposed method in section 3. The details
of our design in given in section 4, followed by a comprehensive
evaluation of the proposed design in terms of different metrics in
Section 5. Section 6 presents some real world applications of the
proposed techniques. We will discuss the potential limitations in
Section 7, and compare our work with prior ones in Section 8. Sec-
tion 9 concludes the paper.
2. ADVERSARY MODEL
This section describes the assumptions required to extract device
IDs from smart phone speakers, and the potential adversary/appli-
cation scenarios where our method may be applicable.
2.1 Application Scenarios
We fully respect that people have the right to protect their pri-
vacy, so the most important goal of this paper is not to propose new
tracking techniques to invade people’s privacy, but instead to bring
a new possible privacy attack into people’s attention and raise an
alarm of such new user tracking method.
However, as a device ﬁngerprinting technology, the proposed
user tracking method itself is neutral, so if it is used properly, it
could beneﬁt our society to a large extent. For example, it can be
used to identify and track stolen phones to support self-destruction
functionality that is now required by law in some places.
It is
also useful to support accurate in-door positioning to provide better
shopping experience in supermarket. More details will be given in
Section 6.
2.2 Assumptions
The device ﬁngerprinting process actually contains three steps:
playing a piece of specially crafted audio, recording the speaker
output, and transmitting the preprocessed feature to servers. These
three steps can be mapped to three different operations or permis-
sions: playing audio, accessing microphone, and accessing Inter-
net.
• Play audio: According to current Android permission mech-
anism, playing audio does not require any permission.
• Access to microphone: This is the only necessary permission
required by our proposed method, since we have to record the
speaker output. However, depending on the speciﬁc applica-
tion scenarios, the microphone permission could be located
on the same phone that plays the audio (i.e., self-ﬁngerprinting),
or on a different phone (cross-ﬁngerprinting).
• Access to Internet: This permission is unnecessary and can
be bypassed because of an existing vulnerability mentioned
in [45] by appending the data to a GET request. The size
of each extracted feature never exceeds 1 KB, so the length
limitation of GET request is also not a problem.

In this section we will introduce the reason why we study sound
acoustic ﬁngerprinting of mobile devices though some related work
already existed. A brief description on the technical background of
our approach will also be presented.
3.1 Three Goals to Be Achieved
We believe that every device ﬁngerprinting technology should
achieve the following three goals simultaneously: uniqueness, ro-
In terms of uniqueness, the ﬁnger-
bustness, and stealthiness.
prints generated from different devices should be different enough
from each other, otherwise there would be serious usability prob-
lem (imagine that two different users share an identical cookie).
Robustness means the ﬁngerprints generation method should be
able to generate a consistent ﬁngerprints for the same device at dif-
ferent time and under different scenarios. The last goal, stealthi-
ness, requires the ﬁngerprints generation process to be unnoticeable
by device owners.
Limitations of existing solutions. When considering above goals,
we found that existing solutions have various limitations. For ex-
ample, the work done in [19] needs to play some audible music,
which makes it hard to achieve “stealth” goal. In another work that
uses accelerometers to track users, there would always be at least
1 device out of 107 wrongly identiﬁed, which may not be accu-
rate enough for cookie based applications in real world [21]. More
details will be given in related work section 8.
3.2 Our Key Techniques
Our key techniques could be described in a single sentence: we
use microphones to record the output from device speakers stim-
ulated by high frequency audio wave with some special pattern.
However, it requires more words to explain the rationale behind
and how uniqueness, robustness, and stealthiness are achieved by
these techniques.
3.2.1 Be Stealthy with High Frequency Audio
Common sense tells us that human being cannot hear all sound
generated by the world. For example, infrasonic wave produced by
earthquake doesn’t make any feeling to human but can be detected
by machines, which plays an important role in the disaster fore-
casting. Ultrasonic possesses similar attributes. Figure. 1 shows
human’s hearable zone [10].
hear almost nothing if your cell-phone is playing a clip of music
with null spectrum between 200 and 15k Hz. Secondly, the energy
transform efﬁciency of the speaker decreases with the increasing
frequency. So, volume decreases with the increasing frequency at
a given input power. Thirdly, the audio is a wide band audio with
energy distributed evenly at multiple frequency component, each
of which possesses only little part energy. This point paraphrases
why the special audio contains components between 14k and 15k
Hz, but cannot be heard.
Figure 2: Stimulation.
3.2.2 Be Unique with High Frequency Audio
Inside each speaker driver, a ﬂexible cone attached with a coil of
wire is mounted on the suspension, which allows it to move freely
inside the magnet. The coil, passing electrical currents, creates a
varying magnetic ﬁeld, and the ﬁeld interacts with the ﬁxed mag-
net to drive the cone to ﬂuctuate according to the currents [18].
Figure. 3 illustrates the structure of the speaker [18].
Figure 1: Sound Pressure Level of Human over Frequency.
Normally, people cannot hear our stimulus as shown in Figure 2
for some reasons. Firstly, most people are sensitive to sound from
some hundreds Hz to some thousands Hz, and people can only feel
little when the sound is lower than 200 or higher than 15 kHz, con-
sidering the limited volume of the phone. In other words, you can

High-end speaker systems may contain more than a single driver
to let each driver focus on each frequency band and enhance the
quality thereby, because one driver can hardly handle the entire
audible frequency range limited by the mechanical feature of the
