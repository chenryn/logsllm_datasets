User: I have started to play with Python and I went directly to Python 3.6.
I have two Python environments now in my system: Python 2..6.6 and Python 3.6
Python 2.6.6 is under: 
which python
/usr/bin/python
And Python 3.6 is under /opt/python3/bin
My problem is that if I try to import tkinter in Python 3.6 it does not work:
./python3.6
Python 3.6.0 (default, Feb 16 2017, 17:37:36)
[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-3)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.



import tkinter
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "", line 1, in 
        File "/opt/python3/lib/python3.6/tkinter/init.py", line 36, in 
          import _tkinter # If this fails your Python may not be configured for Tk
      ModuleNotFoundError: ****No module named '_tkinter'****



If I do in Python 2.6 it works:
python
Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Aug 18 2016, 15:13:37)
[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-17)] on linux2

import Tkinter



PLEASE NOTE, I know that the module is lower case t in Python 3 so instead of import Tkinter, I am typing import tkinter.
My question is: How do I install tkinter in Python 3 in CentOS.
This I what have tried so far:
yum install python3-tk
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, refresh-packagekit, security
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * base: mirror.us.leaseweb.net
 * extras: mirror.us.leaseweb.net
 * updates: mirror.us.leaseweb.net
Setting up Install Process
No package python3-tk available.
Error: Nothing to do
How do I install in CentOS 6 the module tkinter and make Python 3 able to use it?
Thanks for any feedback.
Assistant: If you want to install tkinter in order to use matplotlib you may try 

import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

It worked for me
