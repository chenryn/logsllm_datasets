User: According to the following security indicators, evaluate the security level of the network system and propose improvement measures 1. Number of system vulnerabilities: 5\n2. Weak password usage rate: 30%\n3. Virus infection rate: 2%\n4. Access Lack of control: some users do not have the correct permission restrictions\n5. Incomplete logging: some operations lack detailed records
Assistant: Based on the above security indicators, it is estimated that the security level of the network system is low, and there are major security risks. In response to these problems, the specific improvement measures are as follows: 1. The number of system vulnerabilities: It is necessary to patch and upgrade the software in a timely manner, and regularly scan and repair the system vulnerabilities. 2. Weak password usage rate: It is necessary to force users to use strong passwords, and regularly update and strengthen password policies. 3. Virus infection rate: It is necessary to install the latest anti-virus software for real-time monitoring and protection of viruses, and to strictly filter and restrict mail, network and other channels. 4. Lack of strict access control: It is necessary to establish a complete permission system to classify and control user permissions. Unnecessary accounts and permissions need to be deleted and recovered in a timely manner. 5. Incomplete log records: It is necessary to improve the system log record system, and set up corresponding monitoring strategies and alarm mechanisms to detect abnormal operations and behaviors in time. To sum up, through the above improvement measures, the security level of the system can be effectively improved, the security risk can be reduced, and the normal operation and data security of the network system can be guaranteed.
