that of starting a certiﬁcation authority, and the number of top-
level TDs to be limited (e.g., up to a few hundred) which map
to real-world political or cultural groups. Section IV presents
a detailed description of a TD.
C. Routing, Lookup, and Forwarding
All ADs in SCION know a set of paths to reach the TD
Core in their trust domain for establishing communication with
other endpoint ADs. Speciﬁcally, for an AD N that is not in
the TD Core, we call the paths for sending packets from N to
the TD Core up-paths of N , and the paths for sending packets
from the TD Core to N the down-paths of N , which are not
necessarily different from the up-paths.
The down-paths of each AD N are available to other ADs
via a lookup service, and are used by other ADs to reach N .
To communicate with a destination AD D in another TD, the
source AD S selects a subset of its up-paths to reach the top-
level TD containing S for sending data to D, and can pick an
independent subset of the down-paths for receiving data from
D. In this way, ADs retain control over the paths for both
outgoing and incoming data within their own TDs.
In the following, we ﬁrst sketch routing, name lookup,
and forwarding between two endpoint ADs in the same TD,
and then brieﬂy explain how cross-domain communication is
enabled.
Path construction.
In SCION, ADs use a set of up-
paths/down-paths to send/receive packets to/from the TD
Cores. We generally refer to these up-/down-paths as paths,
which are constructed similar to path vector as follows. The
ADs in the TD Core ﬁrst transmit one-hop paths starting from
214
the core to their 1-hop customer ADs via path construction
beacons. These customer ADs then add themselves to the path
and propagate the received paths to their customers and peers,
and so on. Each endpoint AD then selects among all the paths
received from each provider or peer to form its own k (ideally
maximally disjoint) up-paths for reaching the TD Core and
down-paths for receiving packets from the TD Core.
Lookup. The endpoint ADs publish the selected down-paths
on the TD’s Path Server, a service located in the TD Core,
queried by local and foreign ADs for routing information.
SCION employs Accountable IP (AIP) [17] for host and AD
addressing, where each address represents a public key. The
TD Core signs a TD membership certiﬁcate for each AD
address. A name lookup takes as input a human readable
name of the destination, and returns both the AIP address of
the destination host and AD, and the AD-level down-paths
published by the destination AD.
Path selection. To form a complete end-to-end communica-
tion path to reach a destination, the source AD ﬁrst chooses
one of its up-paths to reach the TD Core and queries the des-
tination’s down-paths via name or address lookup. The source
AD then selects one of the queried destination’s down-paths
to construct a complete end-to-end path. For simplicity, the
gateway in an endpoint AD makes the default path selection
decision on behalf of the hosts in that AD, while a host can
also negotiate with its provider AD to support customized path
selection policies.
Route joining. Before naively combining one of the source
AD’s up-paths with one of the destination AD’s down-paths,
the source AD searches the paths for common ancestor ADs,
to ﬁnd a “shortcut” path without passing through the TD core.
Figure 2 shows an example shortcut that can be found between
AD1 and AD2.
Forwarding. Once a source AD constructs a complete end-
to-end communication path, the source AD embeds in each
packet certain “opaque ﬁelds” created by the transit ADs
during path construction, which encode the forwarding path
information as ingress/egress points at each transit AD in the
end-to-end path. Within each AD, any internal routing protocol
can be used to ﬁnd a path from an ingress point to an egress
point. The destination can simply reverse the embedded path
or query the source AD’s Path Sever for alternative paths to
reach the source. Hence in SCION, packet forwarding between
ADs eliminates the need of routing and forwarding tables.
TD-level routing. When communication crosses domains
(e.g., a source wants to reach a destination in another TD),
TD-level routing enables each TD to determine the routes to
other TDs. TD-level routing takes place using pre-negotiated,
human-conﬁgured routes or source routing to enable explicit
path control. Given the envisioned small and stable topology
of top-level TDs (e.g., around one hundred TDs), scalability
and routing security are no longer major concerns for Inter-TD
routing.
D. Policy Enforcement
In SCION, the stakeholders of end-to-end communication
impose their policy decisions in three stages:
1) Transit ADs apply their routing policies when deciding
which paths to propagate via path construction beacons.
2) Destination ADs apply policy in their selection of k
down-paths to publish at the TD’s Path Server.
3) Source ADs apply policy to select an up-path to the TD
Core and one of the down-paths retrieved from the Path
Server to reach the destination.
E. Small Trusted Computing Base (TCB)
In SCION, TDs provide natural boundaries for failure isola-
tion and domains for strong routing control. SCION assumes
only that the TD Cores are trusted by the ADs in the same
TD, but does not assume that ADs in the same TD, nor a
remote TD Core is trusted. Consequently, the TCB for the
end-to-end communication between two endpoints consists of
the TD Core and only ADs in the corresponding up-paths
and down-paths, whereas in the current Internet architecture
the end-to-end communication can be potentially affected by
any node in the network. Since ADs in one TD share the
same contractual or cultural goals, reach the same business
or technical agreements, and are subject to the same laws
and regulations, the activities of ADs in the same TD are
held accountable for their route computation and deviations
are enforceable because every TD represents a uniform legal
environment. Furthermore, the TD Core in SCION serves as
the root of trust to bootstrap trust and enforce security policies
among ADs in that TD.
IV. ANATOMY OF A TRUST DOMAIN
A trust domain (TD) is the fundamental unit of trust in the
SCION architecture. TDs are communities of network entities
held together by enforceable rules such as contracts, shared
legislative and judicial frameworks, or physical locality. Given
these aggregates, the fundamental goal of the architecture is
to enforce isolation between TDs while providing intercon-
nection. Each trust domain can be considered an independent
networking plane shielded against the inﬂuence of external
entities. The global goal of the architecture is to allow any
endpoint to explicitly specify which set of these networking
planes it wishes to use and facilitate a connection based on
these requirements.
Figure 3 presents the architecture of a TD. Conceptually, a
TD is composed of a contiguous set of ADs along with their
explicitly marked customer-provider relationships. A specially
designated set of tier-1 ADs, called the TD Core ADs,
represents the top level of the AD hierarchy: this set contains
the entities that perform several authoritative functions of the
trust domain, e.g., managing the certiﬁcates and public/private
keys for that TD. The set of TD Core ADs must be connected
and mutually reachable in the AD-graph (e.g., routing between
any ingress and egress points of the TD Core, and reaching
ADs that implement the Path Servers for name lookup). Since
most TD Core ADs in the current Internet are densely peered,

routing in this topology should be simple. Nevertheless, to
enable path choice (i.e., to avoid routing trafﬁc through an
untrusted TD), we propose that a link-state routing protocol
for topology discovery be used in conjunction with source
routing between TD Core ADs.
A trust domain can be a top-level trust domain (TLTD), or
a sub-TD. A sub-TD resides completely within a TLTD and
may contain other sub-TDs. No other TD fully contains a top-
level TD, although its member set may overlap partially with
other TDs. As mentioned before, we anticipate that relatively
few top-level TDs will form (up to a few hundreds), with
each TD corresponding to a large, globally identiﬁable real-
world group (such as a country, or a well-known international
organization).
The TD Core ADs in the top-level TDs facilitate intercon-
nection between top-level TDs using the Inter-TLTD routing
protocol. Since this topology is extremely small and densely
connected (the majority of routes should not need to traverse
more than 2 TDs), most of the routes are static and can be
directly conﬁgured. When automatic route discovery is needed
we assume that TD-level routing policy (e.g., which TD to use
to reach a distant TD) is agreed-upon among the TD Core ADs
beforehand. To facilitate the Inter-TLTD routing protocol, the
TD Core ADs engage in a protocol to discover their mutual
interfaces to other TLTDs in a manner similar to IGP; since
there are only a few of these TD Core ADs per TLTD, each
TD Core AD can simply keep a table of what TLTDs are
reachable from each of its fellow TD Core ADs.
A. Trust Domain Membership
Identiﬁable organizations (a government, an industry con-
sortium, etc.) administer trust domains.
When a new AD wishes to join a TD,
the TD Core
veriﬁes that the AD meets the requirements for membership
216
in the TD (for example, a country-based TD may require
that the corresponding ISPs be registered and headquartered
within a given country). Then the TD authority determines
the topological relationship of the joining AD with respect to
the current TD. To join an existing trust domain, the new AD
should either: 1) have one provider already inside this TD,
or 2) be capable of being a core AD in this TD. To meet the
second requirement, the new AD must be able to directly reach
other core ADs, as well as satisfy a subjective assessment of
the AD’s connectedness: this requirement mirrors customer /
trafﬁc requirements for peering.
When an AD establishes a new connection with an AD in
a different trust domain, it must join one or more of the TD
associations of the provider in order to access the relevant
sets of paths of that provider. The exact TD assignment is
dependent on the terms of the service and contingent on
whether the child AD can satisfy the conditions of joining
the new TDs.
B. Management and Trust Bootstrapping
The TD Core ADs administer each TD. For simplicity
we assume that a single entity performs this function, but
a distributed approach likely prevails in practice. Each top-
level TD has a ﬁxed human readable identiﬁer as well as a
public/private keypair KT DC/K −1
T DC . In practice, each AD
in the TD Core can possess a public/private key pair, and
a threshold number of ADs are required to generate a valid
TD Core signature. Due to the high level of visibility of the
top-level trust domains, we assume that bootstrapping the well-
known TD Core public key KT DC onto the relevant principals
(speciﬁcally, the member ADs in that TD as well as other top-
level TD authorities) occurs securely. For example, service
providers could pass on the public key to their customers.
The TD Core then operates a PKI CA for the member ADs
of that TD, signing certiﬁcates of membership binding ISP
identiﬁcation and AD numbers to ADs and their respective
public keys. The TD CA can either be implemented as a
dedicated server, or split among multiple ADs in the TD Core.
C. Subsidiary Trust Domains
A top-level TD may contain subsidiary trust domains (or
sub-TDs). Figure 3 depicts a sub TD inside the main top-level
TD. Sub-TDs allow ﬁner-grained trust domain selection (for
example, the armed forces of a country may operate a sub-
TD within its own country’s TD, to support a higher level of
assurance than civilian ISPs). A sub-TD’s internal structure
mirrors a top-level TD, with its own full mesh of ADs as the
sub-TD Core, its own name lookup servers, etc. An endpoint
AD also maintains a set of up-paths and down-paths per sub-
TD Core containing that endpoint. The sub-TD’s absence from
the inter TLTD routing protocol provides the only distinction
between a sub-TD and a top-level TD.
D. Beneﬁts of Using Trust Domains
We end this section with a list of intrinsic beneﬁts of
building the inter-domain routing architecture based on the
notion of TDs.
Security against attacks. The strong isolation and control
that SCION’s TDs provide naturally eliminates multiple long-
standing attacks. For example, TD-based isolation intrinsically
eliminates malicious messages and information from other
TDs. ADs within the same TD have enforceable accountability
for their route announcements and computation, because the
ADs are regulated by the same legal framework. Furthermore,
outbound trafﬁc control enables the source ADs to bypass
malicious or untrusted transit ADs, and inbound trafﬁc control
enables the destination ADs to efﬁciently stop, shape, or
regulate unwanted incoming trafﬁc.
Resilience against misconﬁguration. The intrinsic isolation
provided by the division of TDs achieves in-depth resilience
to human error, a prevailing reason for current routing system
outages [18]. First, the simplicity and convenience of needing
only to design a robust
inter-domain routing architecture,
likely to remain relatively stable over time, helps reduce
human conﬁguration errors as opposed to “ad hoc” engineering
hacks prevalent in practice. Second, the TD structure mitigates
the damage to its member ADs and those attempting to reach
them.
Elimination of a single point of trust/failure. The existence
of multiple TDs eliminates the need for a single authority
for the entire Internet, which causes deployment issues and
a single point of failure. For example, DNSSEC currently
requires a single root of trust for the entire Internet, whereas
in SCION each TD maintains its own root-of-trust authority.
Scalability. By scoping the route dissemination and compu-
tation within each TD independently, SCION also achieves
routing scalability. In each TD, only the TD Core originates
routing messages (the path construction beacons), which are
only propagated within the TD. In contrast in path vector or
link state, every node in the network can generate routing
updates, which are disseminated throughout the network. Such
routing scalability enables the use of proactive, frequent path
construction beacons by the TD Core, ensuring that each AD
can learn fresh path state within the TD to address the route
freshness problem stated in Section II.
V. PATH CONSTRUCTION
In this section we describe how each AD learns of its AD-
level paths to the TD Core through periodic path construction
beacons containing routing information.
Up-path and down-path selection. Upstream paths, or “up-
paths” are a set of paths that endpoint ADs select from path
construction beacons for reaching the TD Core. To support
multi-path routing, the protocol enables all ADs to receive
multiple distinct policy-compliant AD-level paths to reach the
TD Core. To keep route lookup overhead practical, we restrict
the number of paths that each endpoint AD maintains in its
reachability record to at most k per TD (an endpoint may
be contained in multiple TDs). In facilitating the construction
of these up-paths, the upstream ADs need not exhaustively
enumerate all possible paths to the TD Core, but must simply
provide a sufﬁcient number of alternatives. Downstream paths,
or “down-paths”, are a set of k paths an endpoint AD selects
from path construction beacons to upload to the TD’s path
lookup server for others to reach that endpoint AD. An
endpoint AD may select a set of different down-paths than
the up-paths to implement independent inbound and outbound
trafﬁc control.
Overview of path construction. Path construction enables
endpoint ADs to ﬁnd their up-paths and down-paths, or
paths in general between the endpoint ADs and the TDCore.
Construction begins with each TD Core AD initiating a path
construction beacon in every time period. Each AD passes
along a path construction beacon to each customer and peer
in the same TD, appending additional information. A path
construction beacon, denoted by U = {(p, G)}, is a set of
pairs (p, G) with each pair corresponding to an announced
path. p and G are as follows:
• a set of links p within a TD assembling a path for
reaching the TD Core, where each link in path p is
timestamped and authenticated; and
• a set of global information G pertaining to all the links
in path p, such as the timestamp T S when the TD Core
initiated the path construction beacon and the TD identity
T D. The TD Core also signs G with K −1
T DC , and G will
not be changed by ADs during path construction.
Each link in p also contains an opaque ﬁeld, which includes
short cryptographic markings, similar to stateless network
capabilities [19], generated by the AD owning that link to
enable efﬁcient forwarding control.
Often, routing at the AD granularity is insufﬁcient. For
example, consider a large carrier with continental reach but
only a single AD number. A route passing through the AD
could be entirely local, or it could cross the entire continent.
Hence, SCION paths specify a sequence of ingress/egress
interfaces at each upstream AD for reaching the TD Core.
