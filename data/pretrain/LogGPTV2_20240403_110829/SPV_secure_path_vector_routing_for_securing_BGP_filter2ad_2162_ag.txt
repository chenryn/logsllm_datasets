## Evaluation of SPV and S-BGP

### Hash Function and RSA Operation
- **Hash Function**: Based on the Rijndael block cipher with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit block size, using the Matyas, Meyer, and Oseas construction.
- **S-BGP Evaluation**: Based on a 1024-bit RSA operation.
- **Assumption**: Certificate signatures are cached.
- **CPU Usage**: Timings were conducted on a Pentium III running at 1GHz.

### Performance Comparison
- **General CPU Usage**: For verifying two streams, CPU usage is generally negligible. However, in more connected parts of the network, the overhead of verification can be much higher.
- **SPV vs. S-BGP**: SPV is a factor of 22 faster, making it more suitable for deployment in the core of the Internet, especially when an AS connects to many peers.

### Network Load and Attacks
- **BGP Processing Time**: During high traffic, BGP may take over 100 seconds to process updates received in one second.
- **Worms and Attacks**: Figure 8 illustrates the impact of the "SQL Slammer" worm on BGP routing traffic.
- **Future Growth**: As the Internet grows, the number of prefixes will increase, leading to higher load from updates.
- **Replay Attacks**: Both SPV and S-BGP support update expiration to limit the impact of replay attacks. SPV, being more efficient, can handle this load better than S-BGP.

### Network Overhead
- **Simulation Results**: On the two days of simulation, SPV incurred a factor of 2.731 more overhead than S-BGP.

## Related Work

### Secure Routing Protocols
- **Secure Distance Vector and Link State Protocols**: Various secure distance vector and link state protocols have been proposed, but the focus here is on secure path vector routing protocols, as BGP is a path vector protocol.
- **IETF RPSEC Working Group**: Chartered to establish security requirements for routing protocols. Several researchers have outlined BGP security requirements and vulnerabilities.
- **Resilient Routing Frameworks**: Pei, Zhang, and Massey presented a framework for building resilient Internet routing protocols, analyzing trade-offs of various techniques.

### Previous Research
- **Ad Hoc Networks**: Our previous work developed cryptographic mechanisms for securing ad hoc network routing protocols, which were not directly applicable to BGP.
- **Misconfigurations**: Misconfigurations account for the majority of route disruptions. Mahajan et al. found that 200-1200 prefixes (0.2-1.0% of the BGP table size) are erroneous due to misconfigurations each day.

## Conclusions

### Benefits of SPV
- **Symmetric Cryptography**: Using purely symmetric cryptographic primitives, SPV offers at least a 20-fold speedup over digital signatures in software, and an additional 2.4-fold speedup in hardware.
- **Novel Concepts**:
  - Private keys within the UPDATEs.
  - Hop-by-hop authentication instead of authenticating the AS that inserts itself onto the path.
  - Security by limiting the number of options an attacker has for modifying critical routing information.
- **Performance**: SPV is faster than S-BGP, especially during high BGP traffic. It can also use shorter epoch times and more effectively secure against replay attacks.
