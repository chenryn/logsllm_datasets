Abstract
We demonstrate that an Internet of Things (IoT) bot-
net of high wattage devices–such as air conditioners and
heaters–gives a unique ability to adversaries to launch
large-scale coordinated attacks on the power grid.
In
particular, we reveal a new class of potential attacks on
power grids called the Manipulation of demand via IoT
(MadIoT) attacks that can leverage such a botnet in order
to manipulate the power demand in the grid. We study
ﬁve variations of the MadIoT attacks and evaluate their
eﬀectiveness via state-of-the-art simulators on real-world
power grid models. These simulation results demonstrate
that the MadIoT attacks can result in local power outages
and in the worst cases, large-scale blackouts. Moreover,
we show that these attacks can rather be used to increase
the operating cost of the grid to beneﬁt a few utilities in
the electricity market. This work sheds light upon the in-
terdependency between the vulnerability of the IoT and
that of the other networks such as the power grid whose
security requires attention from both the systems security
and power engineering communities.

Introduction
A number of recent studies have revealed the vul-
nerabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) to intrud-
ers [21, 49, 50]. These studies demonstrated that IoT de-
vices from cameras to locks can be compromised either
directly or through their designated mobile applications
by an adversary [12, 28, 43]. However, most previous
work has focused on the consequences of these vulnera-
bilities on personal privacy and security. It was not until
recently and in the aftermath of the Distributed Denial
of Service (DDoS) attack by the Mirai botnet, compris-
ing six hundred thousand compromised devices targeting
victim servers, that the collective eﬀect of the IoT vul-
nerabilities was demonstrated [12]. In this paper, we re-
veal another substantial way that compromised IoT de-
vices can be utilized by an adversary to disrupt one of the

most essential modern infrastructure networks, the power
grid.
Power grid security standards are all based on the as-
sumption that the power demand can be predicted reliably
on an hourly and daily basis [62]. Power grid operators
typically assume that power consumers collectively be-
have similarly to how they did in the past and under simi-
lar conditions (e.g., time of the day, season, and weather).
However, with the ubiquity of IoT devices and their poor
security measures (as shown in [12]), we demonstrate that
this is no longer a safe assumption.
There has been a recent trend in producing Wi-Fi en-
abled high wattage appliances such as air conditioners,
water heaters, ovens, and space heaters that can now be
controlled remotely and via the Internet [3] (for the power
consumption of these devices see Table 1). Even older
appliances can be remotely controlled by adding Wi-Fi
enabled peripherals such as Tado◦ [8] and Aquanta [2]. A
group of these devices can also be controlled remotely or
automatically using smart thermostats or home assistants

such as Amazon Echo [1] or Google Home [4]. Hence,
once compromised, any of these devices can be used to
control high wattage appliances remotely by an adversary
to manipulate the power demand.
In this paper, we reveal a new class of potential attacks
called the Manipulation of demand via IoT (MadIoT) at-
tacks that allow an adversary to disrupt the power grid’s
normal operation by manipulating the total power de-
mand using compromised IoT devices (see Fig. 1). These
attacks, in the extreme case, can cause large scale black-
outs. An important characteristic of MadIoT attacks is
that unlike most of previous attacks on the power grid,
they do not target the power grid’s Supervisory Control
And Data Acquisitions (SCADA) system but rather the
loads that are much less protected as in load-altering at-
tacks studied in [11, 41].
It is a common belief that manipulating the power de-
mands can potentially damage the power grid. However,
these speculations have mostly remained unexamined un-
til our work. We are among the ﬁrst to reveal realis-
tic mechanisms to cause abrupt distributed power de-
mand changes using IoT devices–along with Dvorkin and
Sang [24], and Dabrowski et al. [19]. Our key contribu-
tion is to rigorously study the eﬀects of such attacks on
the power grid from novel operational perspectives (for
more details on the related work see Section 6).
We study ﬁve variations of the MadIoT attacks and
demonstrate their eﬀectiveness on the operation of real-
world power grid models via state-of-the-art simulators.
These attacks can be categorized into three types:
(i) Attacks that result
in frequency instability:
An abrupt increase (similarly decrease) in the power
demands–potentially by synchronously switching on or
oﬀ many high wattage IoT devices–results in an imbal-
ance between the supply and demand. This imbalance in-
stantly results in a sudden drop in the system’s frequency.
If the imbalance is greater than the system’s threshold, the
frequency may reach a critical value that causes genera-
tors tripping and potentially a large-scale blackout. For
example, using state-of-the-art simulators on the small-
scale power grid model of the Western System Coordi-
nating Council (WSCC), we show that a 30% increase in
the demand results in tripping of all the generators. For
such an attack, an adversary requires access to about 90
thousand air conditioners or 18 thousand electric water
heaters within the targeted geographical area. We also
study the eﬀect of such an attack during the system’s re-
the black start)
starting process after a blackout (a.k.a.
and show that it can disrupt this process by causing fre-
quency instability in the system.
(ii) Attacks that cause line failures and result in cas-
cading failures: If the imbalance in the supply and de-
mand after the attack is not signiﬁcant, the frequency of

the system is stabilized by the primary controller of the
generators. Since the way power is transmitted in the
the power ﬂows) follows Kirchhoﬀ’s
power grid (a.k.a.
laws, the grid operator has almost no control over the
power ﬂows after the response of the primary controllers.
Hence, even a small increase in the demands may result
in line overloads and failures. These initial line failures
may consequently result in further line failures or as it is
called, a cascading failure [54]. For example, we show
by simulations that an increase of only 1% in the de-
mand in the Polish grid during the Summer 2008 peak,
results in a cascading failure with 263 line failures and
outage in 86% of the loads. Such an attack by the ad-
versary requires access to about 210 thousand air condi-
tioners which is 1.5% of the total number of households in
Poland [58]. During the Summer peak hours when most
of the air conditioners are already on, decreasing their
temperature set points [61] combined with the initiation
of other high wattage appliances like water heaters, can
result in the same total amount of increase in the demand.
We also show that an adversary can cause line failures
by redistributing the demand via increasing the demand
in some places (e.g., turning on appliances within a cer-
tain IP range) and decreasing the demand in others (e.g.,
turning oﬀ appliances within another IP range). These at-
tacks, in particular, can cause failures in important high
capacity tie-lines that connect two neighboring indepen-
dent power systems–e.g., of neighboring countries.
(iii) Attacks that increase operating costs: When the
demand goes above the day-ahead predicted value, con-
servatively assuming that there would be no frequency
disturbances or line failures, the grid operator needs to
purchase additional electric power from ancillary ser-
vices (i.e., reserve generators). These reserve generators
usually have higher prices than the generators commit-
ted as part of day ahead planning. Therefore, using the
reserve generators can signiﬁcantly increase the power
generation cost for the grid operator but at the same time
be proﬁtable for the utility that operates the reserve gen-
erators. For example, we show by simulations that a 5%
increase in the power demand during peak hours by an
adversary can result in a 20% increase in the power gen-
eration cost. Hence, an adversary’s attack may rather be
for the beneﬁt of a particular utility in the electricity mar-
ket than for damaging the infrastructure.

The MadIoT attacks’ sources are hard to detect and dis-
connect by the grid operator due to their distributed na-
ture. These attacks can be easily repeated until being ef-
fective and are black-box since the attacker does not need
to know the operational details of the power grid. These
properties make countering the MadIoT attacks challeng-
ing. Nevertheless, we provide sketches of countermea-
sures against the MadIoT attacks from both the power
grid and the IoT perspectives.
Overall, our work sheds light upon the interdepen-
dency between the vulnerability of the IoT and that of
other networks such as the power grid whose security re-
quires attention from both the systems security and the
power engineering communities. We hope that our work
serves to protect the grid against future threats from in-
secure IoT devices.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides a brief introduction to power systems. In
Section 3, we introduce the MadIoT attack and its vari-
ations, and in Section 4, we demonstrate these attacks
via simulations. In Section 5, we present countermeasure
sketches against the MadIoT attacks. Section 6 presents
a summary of the related work, and Section 7 discusses
the limitations of our work. Finally Section 8 provides
concluding remarks and recommendations. The central
results of the paper are self-contained in the above sec-
tions. We refer the interested reader to the appendix for
an overview of recent blackouts and their connection to
MadIoT attacks, and additional experimental results.
2 Power Systems Background
In this section, we provide a brief introduction to power
systems. For more details, refer to [26, 27, 31, 62].
2.1 Basics
Power systems consist of diﬀerent components (see
Fig. 2). The electric power is generated at power gen-
erators at diﬀerent locations with diﬀerent capacities and
then transmitted via a high voltage transmission network
to large industrial consumers or to the lower voltage dis-
tribution network of a town or a city. The power is then
transmitted to commercial and residential consumers.
The main challenges in the operation and control of the
power systems are in the transmission network. More-
over, since a distributed increase in power demand does
not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the operation of the distribution
network, we ignore the operational details of the distribu-
tion network and only consider it as an aggregated load
within the transmission network. The term power grid
mainly refers to the transmission network rather that the
distribution network.
The transmission network can have a very complex
topology. Each intersection point in the grid is called a

cos(𝜃𝑉 − 𝜃𝐼) is called the power factor of a load.
2.2 Power Grid Operation and Control
Stable operation of the power grid relies on the persis-
tent balance between the power supply and the demand.
This is mainly due to the lack of practical large scale elec-
trical power storage. In order to keep the balance between
the power supply and the demand, power system oper-
ators use weather data as well as historical power con-
sumption data to predict the power demand on a daily
and hourly basis [27]. This allows the system operators
to plan in advance and only deploy enough generators to
meet the demand in the hours ahead without overloading
any power lines. The grid operation should also comply
with the 𝑁 −1 security standard. The 𝑁 −1 standard re-
quires the grid to operate normally even after a failure in
a single component of the grid (e.g., a generator, a line,
or a transformer).
In power systems, the rotating speed of generators cor-

almost entirely determined and governed by Kirchhoﬀ’s
laws given the active and reactive power demand and sup-
ply values. Besides the constraints on the power ﬂows en-
forced by Kirchhoﬀ’s laws, there are other limiting con-
straints that are dictated by the physical properties of the
electrical equipment. In particular, each power line has a
certain capacity of apparent power that it can carry safely.
Unlike water or gas pipelines, the capacity constraint
on a power line is not automatically enforced by its phys-
ical properties. Once the power supply and demand val-
ues are set, the power ﬂows on the lines are determined
based on Kirchhoﬀ’s laws with no capacity constraints in
the equations. Thus, an unpredicted supply and demand
setting may result in electric power overload on some of
the lines. Once a line is overloaded, it may be tripped by
the protective relay, or it may break due to overheating–
which should be avoided by the relay. Hence, the system
operator needs to compute the power ﬂows in advance–
using the predicted demand values and optimal set of gen-
erators to supply the demand–to see if any of the lines will
be overloaded. If so, the conﬁguration of the generators
should be changed to avoid lines overload and tripping.
