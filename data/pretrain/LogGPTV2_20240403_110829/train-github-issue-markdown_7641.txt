Regarding test item #5753  
Just found this issue a day after I did my testing.
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. In a bower.json file, type in a package in the dependency section (I used lodash as the package). It will auto-complete and give you `"lodash":"latest"`
  2. Try changing `latest` to something else, like `^1.0.0`
  3. Note that it does not give you a suggestion like it would in a package.json file.
