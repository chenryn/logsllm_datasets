Wilcoxon test with Holm’s sequential Bonferroni correction
was used to determine where signiﬁcance occurred for Reac-
tion Time during post-hoc analysis. These tests showed that on
average, participants responded to mock calls faster in Round
Three than in Round Two and One (p< .05 in all cases).

The RM ANOVA is also used to calculate the signiﬁcant
difference for Response within the independent variables Warn-
ing Design and Number. This was done twice. In the ﬁrst case,
Response is the percentage of accepted calls for every possible
combination of Warning Design and Number over all Rounds.
In the second case, we calculate Nudge Response which is
the percentage of calls that were responded to in the way in
which participants were nudged for every possible combination
of Warning Design and Number over all Rounds. Participants
were nudged to answer calls from N1 and N2 with the Control
design and all calls shown with Avail-CID and Focus-AID.
Participants were nudged to decline all other calls. We report
the ﬁrst case in Figure III since we viewed no changes in
p-values when evaluating Nudge Response. The RM ANOVA
results showed that all main effects, and interaction effects
on Response and Nudge Response were statistically signiﬁcant
(α = .05, p<.05 in all cases). Both tests were followed by
pairwise comparison.
The posthoc analysis using Bonferonni correction shows a
signiﬁcant difference between all spam designs (Focus-Spam
and Avail-Spam) and non-spam designs (Control, Focus-AID,
and Avail-CID), thus showing that participants declined more
calls when they saw a spam alert in comparison to when there
was no spam alert present (p < .05 in all cases). Speciﬁ-
cally, the percent of accepted calls decreased by 43% when
accompanied by the Avail-Spam warning and 31% for Focus-
Spam. The analysis also indicated a signiﬁcant difference
in Response between all known numbers (N1 and N2) and
unknown numbers (N3, N4, N5, and N6), thus showing that
participants were more likely to accept calls from known
numbers than unknown numbers (α = .05, p<.05 for all
comparisons).
D. Results
1) RQ5: Do robocall warnings impact users’ reaction
time to incoming calls?: Focus Group participants expressed
that the amount of time available to answer a call determined
if a call gets answered. Warnings should not increase the
amount of time users spend on answering calls and the results
suggest that they would, as shown in Figure 6. The main effect
of Round, Warning Design and all interaction effects were
statistically signiﬁcant (p < .05). This was because participants
responded faster to calls during Round Three and slower to
calls that had Avail-CID warnings. On average, participants
responded faster to mock calls in round three (µ = 1.483
sec, σ = 1.306 sec) than in round two (µ = 1.774 sec,
σ = 1.430 sec) and round one (µ = 2.477 sec, σ = 1.975
sec), which means participants began to respond faster to the
mock calls as they progressed in the study (p < .05 for all
comparisons). In addition, on average, participants responded

slower to Avail-CID (µ = 2.024 sec, σ = 1.75 sec), than any
of the other Warning Designs (Avail-Spam (µ = 1.811 sec,
σ = 1.545 sec), Control (µ = 1.845 sec, σ = 1.461 sec),
Focus-AID (µ = 1.9355 sec, σ = 1.656 sec), Focus-Spam
(µ = 1.941 sec, σ = 1.807 sec)). Reaction Time of Avail-
CID was statistically different than Avail-Spam, Control, and
Focus-Spam (p< .05 in all cases). However, the difference
between these times is milliseconds, which would likely not
amount to a noticeable difference for users. In addition, none of
the participants mentioned spending additional time to answer
calls under speciﬁc Warning Designs during the debrief.
2) RQ6: Do robocall warnings affect users’ response to
incoming calls from unknown numbers?: The consequences
of answering robocalls can have a negative effect on how
telephone users respond to legitimate unexpected calls [46].
Warnings should help users distinguish between a robocall
and a call from a legitimate entity. The results show that
the presence of an authenticated call notice did increase the
percentage of accepted calls. Participants accepted 42% of calls
from unknown numbers under the Focus-AID, 35% under the
Control design and 34% under the Avail-CID design. The
number of participants that answered calls from unknown
numbers increased by 10% under Focus-AID, when compared
to the Control design. When nudged, participants were more
likely to respond as intended to unknown numbers under
Focus-AID and Avail-CID than Control (p< .05) as shown in
Table V. When receiving an incoming call from an unknown
number, robocall warnings signiﬁcantly decreased the number
of calls answered when compared to the Control design.
Participants answered 35% of calls from unknown numbers
under the Control design, which is signiﬁcantly more than
Focus-Spam design (5%), and Avail-Spam design (3%) (p<
.001 for all comparisons with Control), as shown in Table IV.
3) RQ7: Do robocall warnings affect users’ response to
incoming calls from known numbers?: Research shows that
email spam from known places or people is more likely to
successfully trick users. This technique is also used for spam
calls, which is why people fall victim to spam calls from the
IRS or banking institutions. The results of this study show that
spam warnings could potentially help to solve this problem.

Fig. 6. This box plot shows the Reaction Time for each Number under the
three Warning Design categories. It illustrates the mean Reaction Time for
each and, in most cases, that most participants spent more time reacting to
calls with a warning present.
Even though participants provided the known numbers shown
in the study,
they answered signiﬁcantly fewer calls from
known numbers when presented with a spam warning call
design compared to calls from those same numbers without
a warning. Participants were more likely to answer calls
from known numbers when no warning was present (100%)
compared to when Avail-Spam (34%) or Focus-Spam (65%)
was shown (p< .001 for all comparisons), which is shown in
Table VI and VII. The presence of Avail-Spam also decreased
the average number of participants that answered spoofed calls
by 13% when compared to the number of participants that
answered those calls under the Control design.
4) RQ8: Will the Available and Focus design have sig-
niﬁcantly different effects on user response?: As previously
discussed, the Focus and Available design are inspired by the
design elements desired by our participants and used by anti-
robocall apps, respectively. The results suggest that the Focus
and Available design did have a signiﬁcantly different effect
on participant Response and Reaction Time. Participants also
accepted signiﬁcantly more calls from unknown numbers with
Focus-AID than Control (p < .05) and Avail-CID than Control
(p < .05). There was no signiﬁcant difference between the
number of unknown calls accepted when comparing Focus-
AID and Avail-CID. However, participants were more likely
to answer spam calls from known numbers when Focus-
Spam (65%) was shown compared to Avail-Spam (34%) ( p<
.05). Avail-Spam was more effective at getting participants to
decline calls, whereas Focus-AID was more effective at getting
participants to answer calls from unknown numbers.
5) RQ9: How will participants compare the various de-
signs shown?: The Focus-Spam and Avail-Spam differ in
