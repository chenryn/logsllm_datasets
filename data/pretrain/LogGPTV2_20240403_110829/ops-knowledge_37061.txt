User: How to create a virtual machine on the cloud platform? Please provide the actual operation steps and explain the principle.
Assistant: Creating a virtual machine requires the following steps: Step 1: Choose a suitable cloud platform There are many cloud platforms on the market to choose from, such as Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud, AWS, etc. Each cloud platform has different characteristics and advantages, so choose a suitable cloud platform according to your own needs. Step 2: Create an instance In the management console of the cloud platform, select the Create Instance menu, and fill in the necessary information, including instance specification, image, system disk, data disk, etc. Instance specifications: including CPU, memory, bandwidth, and network, etc., which can be selected according to your needs. Mirror image: The mirror image of the operating system, you can choose your favorite operating system version. System Disk: The storage device of the virtual machine system, usually a system disk is automatically created. Data disk: If you need to expand storage, you can add a data disk. Step 3: Configure the network When configuring the network of the virtual machine, you can choose to assign a public IP or set a private IP inside the instance to connect the virtual machine to the network. Step 4: Set up security groups Security groups are an implementation of firewalls, and inbound/outbound rules can be set to limit network traffic. By setting security group rules, you can ensure the security of virtual machines. Step 5: Start the virtual machine After the instance is created, you can start the virtual machine on the console of the cloud platform. During the startup process, the cloud platform will check the network and security groups to ensure that the settings are correct before starting the virtual machine. Principle: Cloud computing provides virtualization technology, which divides resources on a physical machine into multiple virtual machines. Each virtual machine is independent of each other, has its own operating system, storage and network connection, and can be used like a physical machine. The process of creating a virtual machine is to run the virtualization software on the physical machine through the management console of the cloud platform to create a virtual machine instance. Each instance corresponds to an independent virtual machine, including its own operating system, network and storage. Resource isolation and security guarantees between tenants. Virtual machines can be started, stopped, and deleted at any time, realizing flexible use of resources and helping users save the cost of cloud resources.
