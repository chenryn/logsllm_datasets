User: Is there an alternative to the os.kill function in Python 3 that will give me a return code? I'd like to verify that a process and it's children actually do get killed before restarting them.
I could probably put a kill -0 loop afterwards or do a subprocess.call(kill -9 pid) if I had to but I'm curious if there's a more elegant solution.
Assistant: os.kill() sends a signal to the process. The return code will still be sent to the parent process.
