User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is it secure to store mysql root password on /root/.my.conf? I never thought about this before. I use a password manager for all my accounts (web/server-admin/etc).

But today I was reading about installing a Nextcloud in a Debian server, and it's stated:


  You should save your MariaDB root username and password in a .my.cnf file, as this will enable you to log in to MariaDB and execute SQL commands without a password prompt.

Should I?

Looking for an answer to this question, I found this: mysql root password - where should it be stored?, where they imply this is a normal situation. 

I already ran the mysql_secure_installation script. So, the root password is already changed. Should I put this password in this /root/.my.cnf file?

Is there more information about this somewhere? I find it really difficult to believe: storing password in plain text in my server seems a very bad idea to me. 

Update: I think it wasn't clear enough. My mistake. So, I would like to clarify: I'm not logged in into my server as root. In fact, it is disabled, I have my user within the sudoers group. And I create a user database for each database I'm creating within the server. As I already stated: I ran the script to secure the database.

Assistant: I'd personally consider it bad advice, for a variety of reasons.


You usually shouldn't be in as root.
Even if you were, you usually shouldn't be in as MySQL's root.
Even if you were, you should be using a password manager or a SQL client that supports secure saving of passwords instead.


The convenience here isn't worth the security tradeoffs, and is only convenient if you've already done some other insecure practices anyways.
