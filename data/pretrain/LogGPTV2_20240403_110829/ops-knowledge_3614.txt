User: I want to rename all files in a folder and add a .xml extension. I am using Unix.  How can I do that?
Assistant: In Python:
Use os.listdir to find names of all files in a directory. If you need to recursively find all files in sub-directories as well, use os.walk instead. Its API is more complex than os.listdir but it provides powerful ways to recursively walk directories.
Then use os.rename to rename the files.
