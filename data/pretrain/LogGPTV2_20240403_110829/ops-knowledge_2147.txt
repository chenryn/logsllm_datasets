User: How to implement real-time monitoring and analyze the memory usage of the process on the Linux system? How to optimize memory resource utilization?
Assistant: 1. Real-time monitoring of process memory usage a. top command: The top command can display the system resource usage of a process in real time, including memory usage, and can also arrange processes in different ways. b. htop command: The htop command is similar to top, but the interface is more friendly, and it also provides more functions, such as filtering processes according to command line parameters, hiding user processes, and so on. c. ps command: The ps command can list all processes and list the usage of various system resources, including memory usage. d. pmap command: The pmap command can view the memory usage of the specified process, including the usage of each memory segment, such as heap, stack, shared memory, etc. 2. Optimize the utilization of memory resources a. Reduce memory leaks: Regularly check the memory usage of applications and release unused memory in time. b. Optimize code structure and algorithm: Reduce memory usage by optimizing code structure and algorithm, such as using pointers, reducing the number of layers of data structures, and so on. c. Increase physical memory or virtual memory: If the memory usage of the application is relatively large, you can increase the physical memory or virtual memory to meet the memory usage requirements of the application. d. Enable memory cache: Enabling memory cache can improve the performance of the system, cache commonly used data, reduce the number of disk I/O, thereby improving the response speed of the system. e. Enable memory paging function: Enabling memory paging function can switch infrequently used memory pages to disk, thereby releasing memory space and increasing the available memory space of the system.
