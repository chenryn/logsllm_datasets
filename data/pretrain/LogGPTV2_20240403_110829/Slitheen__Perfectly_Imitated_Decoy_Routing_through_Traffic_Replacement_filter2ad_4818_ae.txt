### Face and TCP Checksum Recomputation
After processing the face, the data is sent back to its destination with a recomputed TCP checksum.

### Client Connection Termination
Once the client has terminated the connection with the overt site by sending a TCP FIN packet, the station removes the flow from the table. To facilitate resumption of TLS sessions for subsequent requests to the same server, session tickets and session IDs are saved.

### 6. EVALUATION

#### 6.1 Bandwidth
The amount of downstream data a client can receive in a single page load depends on the number and size of the leaf resources of the overt page. We visited the top 10,000 TLS sites on Alexa that support our implemented ciphersuites and measured the amount of downstream data available to a Slitheen client when using these sites as overt destinations.

**Figure 4: Cumulative Distribution Function of Potential Downstream Bandwidth**
Cumulative distribution function of the potential downstream bandwidth for proxied data provided by the Alexa top 10,000 TLS sites.

To collect these results, we used PhantomJS to capture the size of HTTP responses from each site. The total amount of possible downstream bandwidth from each site was measured as the sum of the sizes of all replaceable resources for the page in bytes. This represents the maximum potential downstream bandwidth, as some resources may not be accessible on a path that includes the decoy router, and not all leaf HTTP responses will be replaceable if the headers are contained in a TLS record split across multiple packets.

**Figure 5: Cumulative Distribution Function of Actual Replaced Leaf Content**
Cumulative distribution function of the leaf content that was actually replaced by the relay station in our tests. The total number of bytes, the bytes of leaf content, and the bytes replaced with downstream covert content for each of the Alexa top 500 TLS sites.

We found that the relay station's ability to replace leaf resources varied significantly among sites. For example, yandex.ru, netflix.com, and facebook.com were ill-suited to our system due to factors such as TLS record sizes and packet re-ordering. Facebook was the most extreme case, where none of the leaf content was replaceable by the system. Upon further investigation, we noticed that all leaf content response headers from this site were encrypted in a large record along with the response body and spread across multiple packets, making its content type immutable by the Slitheen station. In contrast, for wikipedia.org, yahoo.com, and quora.com, almost all of the leaf content in our 100 trials was replaced by the Slitheen station. While the station missed some of the leaf content for gmail.com and reddit.com, most leaf resources were replaced without a loss of HTTP state. These findings suggest that the selection of an overt destination should depend on both the amount of leaf content on the site and the amount of replaceable content determined through use.

#### 6.2 Latency Measurements
Slitheen reduces latency from two sources. By queuing downstream data from the covert destination, it removes the latency associated with fetching content from a distant censored site. Additionally, we minimize the latency introduced by the relay station itself by not waiting for data to be proxied to the covert destination but rather queuing up previously collected proxy data for the client to be replaced as soon as incoming packets from the overt site arrive. Our results show that the encryption and replacement procedures do not add enough latency to identify the usage of Slitheen.

**Figure 6: Cumulative Distribution Functions of Page Load Time**
Cumulative distribution functions of the page load time of three overt destinations as both a decoy access and a regular access. The CDF shows a minimal difference in the latency distributions of the two types of access, and a K-S test fails to find a significant difference in the latency distributions due to the Slitheen station replacement and processing.

We measured the time it took to fully load the overt destination both as an overt site for tagged flows whose leaf resources were replaced with proxied data and from a regular, untagged access. We tested three different overt destinations: www.wikipedia.org, gmail.com, and www.yahoo.com, 100 times each. We performed a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the collected data to determine whether the relay station induced a different latency distribution for decoy accesses. The D-values and p-values for the tests were as follows:
- www.wikipedia.org: D-value = 0.11, p-value = 0.58
- gmail.com: D-value = 0.12, p-value = 0.47
- www.yahoo.com: D-value = 0.07, p-value = 0.97

These results indicate that the K-S test fails to find any significant difference in the latency distributions of the overt destination between its use as a regular or an overt site in a decoy routing session.

### 7. CONCLUSION
Slitheen is the first decoy routing system to provide a defense against latency analysis and website fingerprinting attacks. It mimics the packet sequence of a regular visit to the overt site by replacing the site’s actual packets in response to valid resource requests with downstream data from the covert destination, forcing the covert data stream into the shape of the overt data stream. Slitheen eliminates latency from the censored site by building up a queue of downstream data and replacing the contents of TCP segments as soon as they arrive at the station. It also eliminates the censor’s ability to use latencies or packet sequences to fingerprint the covert site accessed through the decoy routing system.

While our system does not support asymmetric flows and requires the in-line blocking of downstream data, we argue that prioritizing security in this trade-off is reasonable given the increased capabilities of technology available to participant ISPs. In return, Slitheen provides stronger defenses against known attacks than any previous decoy routing system.
