### Dependency Relationships and Heterogeneous Software Applications

Dependency relationships can impede the integration of heterogeneous software applications, which often require or enforce specific service configurations. These configurations may include core, enhancing, and optional bundling. The retrieval and alignment of service models into service networks for various exploratory uses (Akkermans et al., 2004) are essential in this context.

### Current Work in Service Modeling

Recent work in the domain of service modeling, such as *-USDL (Unified Service Description Language) service description languages, has addressed services as single atomic entities and groups of services (i.e., service bundles). However, these languages need to be more expressive. They should not only establish the added value of bundled services but also consider organizational, strategic, process, activity, social, KPI dependencies, and cause-effect relationships. Without this additional research, these languages will lead to the creation of service marketplace silos, where a wealth of economic activity information is available but lacks details on service relationships. This lack of information hinders the construction of effective service networks.

Spohrer and Maglio (2010) defined the Initiate-Service-Propose-Agree-Realize (ISPAR) typology of interactions that may occur between service systems. Some of these interactions are directly value-creating (such as proposing, agreeing, and realizing the service), while others do not create value (such as disputes). Analyzing these interactions can provide insights into the evolution of service systems. Therefore, it is crucial to explore and formalize these relationships, as discussed in the next section.

### Open and Rich Relationships in Service Networks

Open and rich relationships in service networks differ significantly from the temporal and control-flow relationships found in business process models (e.g., BPEL, BPMN, Petri nets, EPC). These relationships are open and can be freely accessed and retrieved over the Web. They are rich because they use a multi-layer model to indicate various aspects, such as the role of services in a network (e.g., provider, consumer, competitor, or complementor), the strength of a relationship (e.g., high or low), dependency for survival, comparison based on operations provided, and types of resources transferred (e.g., data, knowledge, physical resources, or financial).

In our previous work (Cardoso, 2013; Cardoso, Pedrinaci, & De Leenheer, 2013), we developed the Open Semantic Service Relationship (OSSR) model, a rich, multi-level relationship model derived from an extensive literature review. This model, shown in Figure 2, provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and modeling service relationships.

### Two Viewpoints on Service Networks

There are two primary viewpoints on service networks, as depicted in Figure 3:

1. **Service Descriptions as First-Class Citizens**: In this view, a service network is a set of service descriptions and their inter-relationships. A service relationship is functional, constraining possible networks by setting permitted and obligated interactions (events) between pairs of services in terms of business rules (cause-effect relations).

2. **Service Systems as First-Class Citizens**: Here, a service network is a team of peers (service systems) that establish necessary relationships to provide a service. These relationships are social, defined by mutual trust (e.g., responsiveness, reciprocity, availability based on collaboration history) and their resources. These relationships constrain possible social interactions that cumulatively contribute to the creation, commitment, execution, and detention of new service offerings. This viewpoint is widely accepted in the Service Science community.

Both viewpoints are necessary to provide a complete description of social and functional relationships in service networks. For reasoning purposes, nodes and relationships in service networks must be ontologically analyzed to allow for conceptual hierarchies (part-of, is-a).

### Populating Service and Relationship Models

#### Populating Service Models

To populate service models, a (semi)automated approach can be used, relying on the aggregated input from different users. Service providers are likely to see the value in providing machine-interpretable descriptions of their services to improve the accuracy of search engines. This process, already underway for product descriptions using GoodRelations, can be accelerated by dedicated service search engines, providing indirect incentives for the publication of machine-processable service descriptions.

Automated methods, such as web crawlers combined with data mining and scraping techniques, can extract unstructured service descriptions from corporate websites and marketplaces. These techniques have been successfully applied in other domains and can be used to automatically create service models on-the-fly.

#### Populating Relationship Models

The population of rich service relationships leading to the emergence of open and complex service networks can also be achieved through automated and manual techniques. Content analysis techniques can be used to profile services and companies, identifying similar services and potential competitors. This information can help customers locate similar services and encourage innovation among companies.

Advanced analysis can involve mining recurrent service bundles across different providers to identify common offerings, such as "Internet + Telephone + TV." This analysis can scale beyond individual services and enable the identification of similar or related services.

### Service Network Construction

Once service and relationship models are populated and published as Linked Data, accessing and retrieving distributed models from the Web requires parallel approaches. We achieve scalability by merging state-of-the-art developments, such as LDSpider (a Linked Data crawling framework) and the Sesame RDF repository. LDSpider, extended with specific crawling strategies, can traverse and consume distributed service models concurrently.

### Current Initiatives and Application Fields for OSSN

While the initial motivation for OSSNs was drawn from financial networks, their potential extends to various other domains. Several ongoing projects are using Linked USDL for diverse applications, each with unique characteristics and requirements. We will explore these applications in detail, highlighting the versatility and applicability of OSSNs in different fields.
