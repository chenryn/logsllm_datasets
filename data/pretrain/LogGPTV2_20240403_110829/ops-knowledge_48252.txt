**Issue with Running a Python Script from Windows Task Scheduler**

I have a Python script (.py file) that reads integers from a separate CSV file. I am unable to launch this script using the Windows Task Scheduler, despite spending two days troubleshooting. While there are many similar questions online, none of the solutions have adequately addressed my specific issue.

**Background:**
- I can successfully run other Python scripts and executables via the Task Scheduler.
- The problem only occurs when the Python script needs to read from an external CSV file.
- I have converted the script into a batch file and have tried various combinations of administrative and permission settings, but the issue persists.

**Question:**
Has anyone encountered a similar issue or have any workarounds for running a Python script that reads from a CSV file via the Windows Task Scheduler?

**Details:**
- Operating System: Windows 7
- Task Scheduler Configuration:
  - Security Options: SYSTEM account selected, high privileges checked.
  - File Access: Confirmed that the CSV file can be accessed (e.g., written to with Notepad).
  - Execution Method: Tried calling the Python interpreter directly with the script as an argument.
  - Permissions: Verified the execution profile of the Python command processor and compared it to the ownership of the CSV file.
  - Alternative Test: Created a new, empty text file in a different location (e.g., C:\) and attempted to read from it instead of the original CSV file.

Thank you for any assistance or suggestions.
