User: I need a routine in python to test for a string that contains an absolute path, that is Unix style format. 
So that /home/eduard/tmp/chrome-data-dir/file.ext would be a valid path.
But C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe would not be a valid path.
I need also the path to bet tested not contain characters that might be consider special like: *,?
Assistant: Your first example is not a relative path, it's absolute because it begins with /. The second is also absolute, since the first character after the drive name is a \.
A relative path in Unix would be something like chrome-data-dir/file.ext or ../../include/.
Your question is kind of unclear.
Perhaps you should look for a colon?
