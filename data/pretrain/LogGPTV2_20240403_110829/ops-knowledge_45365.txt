**Question:**
I have a question related to logging in Windows Server 2003. I would like to determine which computer a specific user is currently using (i.e., where they are logged in). Is it possible to check the user sessions on domain-joined computers?

**Answer:**
Yes, you can determine this information by reviewing the security event logs on your server. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open the Event Viewer on your Windows Server 2003.
2. Navigate to the "Security" log.
3. Search for events related to the user's login name. These events will show you the time, date, and the specific computer (including its name and IP address) where the user logged in.

This method should provide you with the necessary details to track user sessions across domain-joined computers.

Thank you!
