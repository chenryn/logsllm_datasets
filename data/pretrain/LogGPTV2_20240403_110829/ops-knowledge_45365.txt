User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows server 2003 find user's computer I would like to see which computer is used by a user (where he's working on), is it possibile to check user session in domain's computers?
Thanks

Assistant: You should be able to see this if you search/look in your security event logs on your server. If you search for the login name you should see when and on which computer (name and ip) that your user logged in to.
