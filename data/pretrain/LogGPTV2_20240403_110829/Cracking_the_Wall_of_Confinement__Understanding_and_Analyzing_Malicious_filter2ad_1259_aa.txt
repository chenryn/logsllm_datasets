Abstract—Take-down operations aim to disrupt cybercrime
involving malicious domains. In the past decade, many successful
take-down operations have been reported, including those against
the Conﬁcker worm, and most recently, against VPNFilter.
Although it plays an important role in ﬁghting cybercrime, the
domain take-down procedure is still surprisingly opaque. There
seems to be no in-depth understanding about how the take-down
operation works and whether there is due diligence to ensure its
security and reliability.
In this paper, we report the ﬁrst systematic study on domain
takedown. Our study was made possible via a large collection
of data, including various sinkhole feeds and blacklists, passive
DNS data spanning six years, and historical WHOIS informa-
tion. Over these datasets, we built a unique methodology that
extensively used various reverse lookups and other data analysis
techniques to address the challenges in identifying taken-down
domains, sinkhole operators, and take-down durations. Applying
the methodology on the data, we discovered over 620K taken-
down domains and conducted a longitudinal analysis on the
take-down process, thus facilitating a better understanding of the
operation and its weaknesses. We found that more than 14% of
domains taken-down over the past ten months have been released
back to the domain market and that some of the released domains
have been repurchased by the malicious actor again before being
captured and seized, either by the same or different sinkholes.
In addition, we showed that the misconﬁguration of DNS records
corresponding to the sinkholed domains allowed us to hijack
a domain that was seized by the FBI. Further, we found that
expired sinkholes have caused the transfer of around 30K taken-
down domains whose trafﬁc is now under the control of new
owners.

INTRODUCTION
Domain take-down is a powerful tool against cybercrime.
When a domain is involved in illicit activities, such as malware
distribution, pharmaceutical, and counterfeit goods trading, it
can be seized by a law enforcement agency (e.g., FBI) or other
take-down parties (e.g., Conﬁcker Working Group [4]). The
seizure is based on a court order or a formal complaint to stop
an ongoing cyber criminal activity. The seized domain is then
blocked by redirecting all visits to a sinkhole or by refusing to
resolve the domain. It can be released later, once it becomes

involves several steps (complaint submission,
“clean”, i.e., no longer involved in any malicious activities.
Challenges in understanding domain take-downs. Although
domain seizures are addressed in ICANN guidelines [55]
and in other public articles [14, 31, 38], there is a lack of
prominent and comprehensive understanding of the process.
In-depth exploration is of critical importance for combating
cybercrime but is by no means trivial. The domain take-down
process is rather opaque and quite complicated. In particular,
it
take-down
execution, and release, see Section II). It also involves multiple
parties (authorities, registries, and registrars), and multiple
domain management elements (DNS, WHOIS, and registry
pools). In addition, little information is available about the
taken-down domains,
take-down parties, and the operators
controlling them. Therefore,
this information needs to be
collected to make the study possible. Furthermore, evaluating
the security and performance of the take-down party requires
nontrivial effort as each party manages its own DNS settings.
Our study. In this paper, we report the ﬁrst systematic study
on domain take-down aiming at answer a set of questions
critical to understanding the security and reliability of this
process. For example, how long does an abusive domain
remain active before it is taken down? How long has a seized
domain been conﬁned before being released? Once released,
how soon does the domain become available for purchase? Are
there any security loopholes in this process? What is the best
take-down practice?
Seeking answers to these questions was made possible
by our broad collection of data, including multiple feeds for
sinkhole lists, eight domain blacklists, passive DNS (PDNS)
data that spans the past six years, and historical WHOIS data
provided by our industry collaborator. Using these datasets,
we design and implement a unique methodology that utilizes
various reverse lookup techniques to ﬁnd taken-down do-
mains. More speciﬁcally, we manually build a list of sinkhole
nameservers and IP addresses by searching various online
posts, and reverse WHOIS lookup on known sinkhole regis-
trant information, such as contact information, to ﬁnd hidden
sinkholes. Further, our approach leverages PDNS to determine
their sinkhole duration and release date, and addresses the
challenges introduced by the PDNS data aggregation.
To discover delisted taken-down domains, which are not
resolved by nameservers, and are therefore invisible to the
PDNS, we designed an algorithm that automatically analyzes
the historical WHOIS data to identify these domains and
their take-down durations. Using such domain and duration
information, not only can we analyze the taken-down domains’
lifecycles, but we are also able to study the effectiveness of the
take-down operations and the security assurance they provide.
Findings. By processing and analyzing the collected dataset,
our research sheds new light on the elusive take-down process
and brings to light new security-critical observations. In partic-
ular, we found 600K seized domains and analyzed their take-
down lifecycles over six years. On average, malicious domains
have been taken-down for two years (see Section IV-B). We
observed that some malicious domains have been controlled
by the criminal again after being released. For example, the
domain ugnazi.com was taken down in 2012 and was re-
registered by the attacker in 2017 (see Section V-B).
Our study revealed certain weaknesses in the administration
and management of some take-down actions. Most concerning
is that some sinkhole nameservers’ domains have expired and
been allowed to be repurchased by the public. We identiﬁed
one sinkhole operator, Conﬁcker working group, with three
sinkhole nameservers’ domains that expired in 2011 and were
repurchased by different parties, giving the new owners access
to more than 30K taken-down domains.
Interestingly, we also found that some take-down parties
utilize a Cloud DNS service for sinkholing and leave their NS
records outdated after they have stopped using the cloud DNS
service. We discovered such a problem in the FBI’s take-down
action and successfully took over a domain taken-down by the
FBI with an outdated NS record, and redirected its trafﬁc to a
web server under our control.
Another issue revealed by our research is the erroneous
settings of seized domains. Some of these domains quickly
expire, well before their expected take-down duration ends.
This causes them to be returned to the registration pool
and be available for repurchase by the adversary. More than
14% of domains taken down over the past 10 months have
been released back to the domain market. This amount of
time is much shorter than the expected “forgetting” duration
after release for completely disconnecting the domains from
malicious activities. Such a problematic treatment makes it
easy for these domains to fall back into the adversary’s hand.
Contributions. The contributions of the paper are as follows:
• New understanding of domain take-down. We conducted
the ﬁrst
in-depth study on domain take-down, an elusive
process with few publicly available details. Using a large
passive DNS dataset spanning over six years and a unique
methodology, we were able to investigate 19 sinkhole operators
and acquire a new understanding of their take-down process.
• Security analysis of take-down parties. Based on the
new understanding, we further analyzed domain take-down
parties’ security protection. We discovered problematic settings
of their nameservers and misconﬁgurations in the domains they
control. These discoveries will help in identifying a set of best
practices important for avoiding such pitfalls.
Roadmap. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section II provides the background information. Section III
introduces the methodology and the datasets used in our study.
Section IV analyzes the variation in the sinkholing duration by
different parties and some loopholes in the sinkhole process.
Section V reports malicious reuse of previously taken-down
domains and the availability of malicious domains. Section VI
discusses the limitations of the study and the best practices
for conﬁguring take-down operations. Section VII reviews the
related prior research, and Section VIII concludes the paper.
II. BACKGROUND
Domain take-down1 is the process of repossessing a do-
main name from its currently registered owner due to a
violation of the Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) deﬁned by
ICANN, registries and registrars,, which are involved in the
domain registration process. Violations of AUPs can range
from name disputes, such as typos of brand names [58], to
illicit content distribution, such as websites selling counterfeit
products and those hosting malicious content. Domain take-
down is a complicated process involving the collaboration
of a number of parties at different
levels, sometimes in
different countries, each with its own rules and regulations.
These parties include: the take-down requester, the take-down
authority, and the take-down executor. It also involves the
affected elements of the Internet name system, such as DNS,
WHOIS and registry domain pools.
The take-down process is initiated by a take-down re-
quester who essentially reports the domain’s violations and
submits a request to suspend its operation. The request may
be in the form of ﬁling a complaint with the domain’s registrar,
for example [16], or through a court order, such as the take-
down of Citadel domains [3]. A take-down request using a
court order forces the compliance of the parties named in
the order, such as registries, registrars, and hosting providers.
These court orders are usually prepared in accordance with
the guidelines provided by ICANN [55], which details the
necessary steps for submitting a take-down request to the court.
Take-down authorities are third-party services specializing in
domain take-down, such as brand-name protection companies,
but in most cases we ﬁnd they are within the same party as
the take-down requester. Take-down executors carry out the
take-down operation by modifying the Internet name system
to reﬂect the changes speciﬁed in the court order, as explained
next.
In some cases, the take-down operation involves transfer-
ring the ownership of the domain to the take-down requester
(e.g., law enforcement). In this case, the request to possess
the domain is speciﬁed in documents prepared for the court.
The advantage of transferring the ownership is that it provides
the take-down requester full control over the domain, such
as obtaining measurement on the trafﬁc they receive. The
registration fees might be waived, especially for law enforce-
ment agencies or when the operation is carried out against a
large malware campaign [5, 55]. However, when possessing a
domain is not necessary, registries or registrars are ordered by
the court to implement requested changes without transferring
the ownership to the take-down requester.
A. Operational Elements
A domain take-down is accomplished by making changes
to the Internet name system, essentially revoking its current
owner’s access. This can be achieved by redirecting the do-
main’s trafﬁc (i.e., sinkholing) and delisting the domain.
Domain sinkholing. Sinkholing is a way to redirect the taken-
down domain’s trafﬁc to a new destination, a sinkhole. Take-

seizure” interchangeably.

down parties opt for sinkholing for a number of reasons;
some parties intend on showing warning banners for victims
visiting the domain, while others mimic the operation of a
command and control center (C&C) to keep the compromised
machine from attempting to connect to a new C&C domain or
to collect the trafﬁc for research purposes [57]. Sinkholes are
operated and managed by either third-party services, such as
Shadowserver [32], take-down authorities, such as the FBI, or
take-down executors, such as GoDaddy.
Technically, domain sinkholing is performed by changing
the conﬁguration of a domain’s DNS records. DNS is a
hierarchical system that maps a domain name to its IP address.
To resolve a domain properly, the owner has to set an NS
record at the registrar, which, in turns, points to the IP address
(i.e., the A record) of the domain/host. In order for sinkholing
to take effect, the registrars and registries named in the court
order set the DNS records of the taken-down domain to point
to the sinkhole. This can be done by setting the nameserver
(i.e., NS record) to point to the nameserver of the sinkhole.
As a result, the trafﬁc will be diverted from the malicious
domain. Figure 1 shows the changes in the DNS records for the
malicious domain msofwarestore.com before and after being
sinkholed by the FBI. Alternatively, Figure 2 shows a less
popular option, which is setting the A record of the domain’s
NS record to point to the IP address of the sinkhole IP directly.
Domain delisting. Domain delisting is essentially the process
of deactivating a domain by removing it from DNS and
responding with nonexistence (i.e., NXDomain) to any DNS
queries. However, removal from DNS is not enough to delist
a domain, as it may return to the pool of available domains
at the registries. Delisting goes a step further by modifying
the WHOIS records of the domain and placing a hold on the
domain, thus stopping it from being released back to registries
until it either expires or the hold is removed.
The WHOIS domain database is an Internet directory con-
taining domain registration information, such as contact details
of its registrants, administrator, and technical support staff.
Additionally, a WHOIS record includes domain Extensible
Provisioning Protocol (EPP) status codes [12], which deﬁne
how a domain’s registration can be managed. EPP codes can
indicate if a domain is active or whether it can be transferred,
modiﬁed, or deleted. For example, an OK EPP code indicates
a normal state. There are two types of EPP codes: client
and server codes. Registrars are allowed to set client EPP
status codes, while server EPP status codes can only be set by
registries when necessary to override other EPP codes that may
be set by the registrar (i.e., client EPP codes). In the process
of domain take-down, registries and registrars may delist a
domain by setting its EPP status code to SERVERHOLD and
CLIENTHOLD, respectively. Placing a domain on hold in this
way causes it to be nonexistent in the DNS and unavailable
for purchase through registrars. Typically, domains taken down
in this way remain delisted until their old registration records
expire.
In addition to domain sinkholing and delisting, we also
observe very rare cases in which a domain becomes RESERVED
as part of a seizure process. Reserved domains are the ones
locked by their TLD registry. These domains are not included
in the public pool of available domains. Reserved domains are
locked for different reasons (e.g., due to name collision, or due
to short domain name) and not necessarily because of a take-
down process. We consider these reserved domains out of the
scope of our study as they are rarely used in seizure actions,
