Abstract
Spam botnets are no more driven by personal agenda, fun
or proof of skills but by an underlying economic engine.
Not until recently, intrusion detection techniques have ap-
proached spambot as a purely behavioral trafﬁc detection
problem using statistical features of mail trafﬁc. Then, re-
cently some efforts were made to comprehend the un-
derly economic engine of spambot. These approaches ei-
ther presents an abstract view of spambot economy or adapt
purely measurement based approach to quantify spambot
economy. No study so far has tried to bridge the gap between
spambot detection and spambot economic modeling. We for-
malize the spambot economic system to monetize spammer
efforts to spammer utility. We use standard consumer eco-
nomic theory to translate spam activity to spammer utility.
We also constrain this spammer utility through statistical
features of mail trafﬁc used by existing spambot detection
techniques.
Keywords Botnet detection, spam economics, information
theory, IDS tuning.
Introduction
1.
A myriad of studies are reporting an exponential increase in
the number and size of worldwide botnets [1, 2, 15, 17, 20,
20, 21]. For instance, it has been reported that the Storm bot-
net increased by a factor of three during the second quarter
of 2008. The reason of such exponential growth is the ﬁ-
nancial gain that these spam botnets can generate [1–3]. Ab-
sent grounded empirical data, it is challenging to reconcile
”revenue estimates” that can range from $2M/day for one
spam botnet [4]. Paxson et. al [1] have documented 82,000
and 37,00 monthly orders for seven counterfeit pharmacies
and counterfeit software stores, respectively. The spammers
running all these spams generally purchase time from a bot
master to launch a spam campaign with a single objective
to increase their respective proﬁt margins from such spam
campaigns.
Until recently, most existing techniques, meant to block
or ﬁlter spam activity, relied on statistical features of mail
trafﬁc [6, 11, 16, 18, 22, 23]. The effectiveness of all these
techniques is measured in terms of high spam activity detec-
tion with low false positives, but is limited due to innate op-
erational complexities and inherent uncertainties [7]. How-
ever, absent a rigorous treatment, the resulting information
vacuum is all too easily ﬁlled with opinions, which in turn
can morph into fact over time. However, while these same
technical aspects were emphasized a lot by security com-
munity, recently, researchers [1, 2, 5, 10, 12] have explored
the underlying economic engine that drives this ecosystem.
Some of them [1, 2] have performed a rigorous measure-
ment based studies of the ﬁnancial aspect of spam activity
and others [10, 12] abstracts the revenue model of spammers
and bot masters. Thus far, however, no study has considered
both economics and statistical features of mail trafﬁc in re-
lation to each other.
In this paper we make two contributions:
[Copyright notice will appear here once ’preprint’ option is removed.]
• We formalize the spam economic system to materialize
spammer efforts into revenue.
• Constrained this ﬁnancial spam ecosystem through sta-
tistical features of mail trafﬁc.

In ﬁrst case, we build a revenue/economic model to mon-
etize the modern spam activity by adapting the general con-
sumer theory of economics. In spam economy, spammer is
a consumer looking for commodities and every commodity
has an associated utility and like any other consumer spam-
mer want to maximize his utility. We start by deﬁning a com-
modity for spammer (consumer). To our best knowledge, we
consider all relevant factors of interest, that a spammer may
consider to rent a botnet, and formalize a commodity for
spam economy. Then, come the next step that how a con-
sumer will choose different commodities, which basically
depicts the choice behavior of consumer. We have assumed
a rational behavior of spammer, which simpliﬁes the choice
structure but for a rational behavior of consumer, commod-
ity model must exhibit some certain properties. We show that
our spam commodity model exhibit all those properties and
it is safe to assume rational behavior. As a last step in eco-
nomic modeling, we establish the utility function of a com-
modity to calculate the utility associated with each commod-
ity. The objective function of spammer in our modeling is to
maximize this utility.
In second case, we introduce statistical features of mail
trafﬁc as limiting forces in spam economic model to restrict
the total utility. We consider following statistical features, as
discussed by existing literature [6, 11, 16, 18, 22, 23]: inter-
departure time, number of emails per recipients, distribution
of new recipients per sampling window and size of spam
email. It is claimed in the literature that these features can
discern spam behavior from normal behavior. As a proof
of concept we only constrain using inter-departure time and
number of emails per recipients.
2. Related Work
Ramachandran and Feamster [16] focused on the network
properties of spam and showed that network-level charac-
teristics of spam are sufﬁciently different than those of le-
gitimate emails. The work in [6] detects spam from email
server logs by measuring changes over time from a partic-
ular source. In [22], a framework, called AutoRE, was pre-
sented to ﬁlter out any legitimate URLs and focus on the
URL that the spammer wants his victims to click on to buy
his merchandise or download his malware. Using their sig-
nature method, Xie et al. were able to identify botnet mem-
bership and determine which bots were used in the various
spam campaigns.
Li et. al [12] proposed an abstract economic model for
both both botmaster and attacker. They focused on the use
of botnets for DDoS attack. After formalizing the model
they introduce the concept of honeypots: fake bots which
increase the probability of failure for attacker as he does not
know how many bots he needs to launch a successful attack.
However, the authors do not associate their model to any
parameters used by their ﬁlters.

Steven et al. [11] proposed entropy and machine-learning
detectors to differentiate between human and chat bots. A
recent study on spamming botnet detection by Yao [23]
proposed to detect bots (BotGraph) by constructing a large
user-user graph. Kyle et al [18], used entropy to measure
the effectiveness of different trafﬁc features in identifying
the spam behavior. Chris and Paxson et al [1, 2] are very
prominent recent studies that have rigorously analyzed the
spam economics using measurement based approach. They
have established some very important statistics about spam
ﬁnancial ecosystem.
As mentioned earlier we are different from all these ap-
proaches because we are not just formalizing the spam eco-
nomic system but to establishing a relationship between
spam ﬁnancial system and statistical features of mail trafﬁc,
and we also materialize this relationship.
3. Spam Botnet Economics
Spam ecosystem is being driven by underlying ﬁnancial en-
gine. It has become an economic system with all driving
forces that are a part of any other economic system. From
an economic perspective, every economy has two vital en-
tities: producers (botmasters) and consumers (spammers).
Botmasters want to reduce the production cost of the prod-
uct (bots) and spammers want to reduce the buying cost of
the product (renting botnets). We base our economic model
upon the basics of consumer theory of economics and we
only concern ourselves with the spammer not the botmas-
ter. Similar to any other business, cost is the pivotal point
of the spamming industry and therefore it is important to
study economic issues when discussing shutting down spam-
mers [1, 2, 5, 9, 19]. So, as ﬁrst contribution we build an
economic model for spammer that calculates the revenue as-
sociated with a spammer activity in terms of utility.
3.1 Economic Model Preliminaries
Economics is the study of the choices people make about
commodities (products or services) as the result of scarcity.
In spam economy, spammer is a consumer looking to choose

any commodity with maximum utility. We start by deﬁning a
commodity for spammer/consumer. To our best knowledge,
we consider all relevant factors of interest, that a spammer
may consider to rent a botnet, and formalize a commod-
ity for spam economy. An exhaustive list of such factors in
the present problem is: 1) Botnet size; 2) Bot bandwidth; 3)
Spam mail template size; 4) Cost of victim email addresses;
5) Unit time cost of the rented botnet; 6) Maintenance botnet
cost; 7) Mail content generation; 8) Active duration of bot-
net; 9) Response rate (number of mails get positive response
from the end user.); and 10) Proﬁt per response.
From a spammer’s perspective, maintenance cost is al-
ready a part of the botnet rent cost, so it is no direct con-
cern to the spammer. Cost of victim email addresses [9]
and mail content generation cost are not recurring costs, be-
cause a spammer can always reuse the same victim email
addresses or mail contents, and in economic theory a com-
modity cost has to be recurring in nature. Similarly, response
rate and proﬁt per response are not in control of the spammer
or spamming industry and cannot impose any constraint on
renting botnet decision. This phases out these factors from
the ﬁnal deciding factors that affect botnet selection deci-
sion. If we merge the remaining factors, botnet size, bot
bandwidth and spam mail template size, we can derive an-
other factor, referred to as spam mail output rate, as in Equa-
tion. 1:
N(cid:88)
i=1
ν =
Bi
S
(1)
where i represent a bot, Bi represents the bandwidth
of the ith bot, S is the spam mail template size and bot-
net has N bots. We call this spam mail output rate (ν).
When a spammer choose a commodity it chooses some de-
sired quantity, let x be the quantity of a commodity ν. Then
c = x ∗ ν represents the total outcome (work) of the com-
modity1. This covers the active duration factor as mentioned
above. We call c as basic commodity of our model. A spam-
mer’s choice of botnets is always restricted either because of
botnet cost, botnet reliability, geographical constraints etc.
So, in spam economy spammer has a ﬁnite number, say K
number of available commodities. Normally in real, spam-
mers rent multiple botnets to achieve some aggregated out-
come. Let, β is a set comprises of any arbitrary combina-
tion of commodities that a spammer can choose. We call this
a consumption bundle. As there are total K commodities,
there are total (cid:60)K possible consumption bundles. Every con-
sumption bundle βl (where 1 ≤ l ≤ (cid:60)K) has an associated
aggregated outcome Cl given by Equation. 2.

Every commodity ck has a price pk and every consump-

βl}. There exists some consumption bundles that a spammer
