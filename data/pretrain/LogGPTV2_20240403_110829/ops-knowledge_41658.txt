User: I am getting an architecture error while importing any package, i understand my Python might not be compatible, can't understand it.
Current Python Version - 2.7.10

`MyMachine:desktop *********$ python pythonmath.py
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "pythonmath.py", line 1, in 
      import math
  ImportError: dlopen(/Users/*********/anaconda/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/math.so, 2): no suitable image found.  Did find:
      /Users/**********/anaconda/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/math.so: mach-o, but wrong architecture

Assistant: Below steps resolved this problem for me.

Quit the terminal.
Go to Finder => Apps
Right Click on Terminal
Get Info
Check the checkbox Open using Rosetta

Now, open the terminal and try again.
PS: Rosetta allows Mac with M1 architecture to use apps built for Mac with Intel chip. Most of the times the reason behind most of the architecture problems is this chip compatibility reason only. So, 'Open using Rosetta' for terminal allows us to use Rosetta by default for such applications.
