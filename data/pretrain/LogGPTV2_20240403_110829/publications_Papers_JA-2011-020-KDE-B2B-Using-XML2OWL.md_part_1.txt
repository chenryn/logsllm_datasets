### Abstract
XML-based standards have been widely adopted to facilitate Business-to-Business (B2B) integration. Examples include cXML, CIDX, and ebXML. While these standards are syntactic, modern organizations increasingly use semantic descriptions like RDF(S) and OWL for internal data representations. This scenario presents a challenge: how to reconcile external XML-based standards with internal OWL-based representations in B2B integration. This paper introduces a conceptual approach and its implementation, B2BISS, which uses heterogeneous mappings to integrate syntactic and semantic data representations. As the number of mappings in the repository grows, organizations can transition from semi-automatic to fully automatic B2B integration.

### 1. Introduction
The global economy is becoming increasingly networked, with concepts such as value chains, value nets, b-Webs, and value networks being used to understand and analyze interconnected industries. These tools help portray the interconnection of operations, players, and transactions, highlighting the importance of developing B2B solutions for integration. The goal of B2B integration is to streamline transaction-based interactions, reduce costs, increase revenues, and improve time-to-market.

Organizations often rely on XML-based domain-specific standards for B2B transactions, such as cXML, CIDX, and ebXML. While these standards enable data exchange, they do not ensure system interoperability. XML provides only syntax, whereas semantics, based on ontologies like RDF(S) or OWL, offer benefits such as inferencing and information sharing.

The networked economy requires aligning alliances, technical infrastructures, and data exchanged in business networks. A significant gap in B2B integration is the lack of a common understanding between external standards and internal organizational data representations. Developers must manually map XML-based standards to internal OWL-based representations, a time-consuming and costly task.

WSML, WSMO, and WSMX use semantically annotated services to promote B2B integration through data and process integration. However, this approach has limitations, including the use of non-standard languages and the inability to reuse mappings. Our approach, implemented in B2BISS, allows organizations to use XML-based standards for external transactions while structuring internal data semantically using OWL. B2BISS enables the creation of reusable heterogeneous mappings, reducing integration time and cost.

### 2. B2B Integration Scenario
Organizations implement B2B infrastructures to interact seamlessly with various business partners, including suppliers, distributors, exporters, and retailers. B2B integration involves more than just buying and selling; it includes servicing customers, collaborating with partners, and conducting electronic transactions. Drivers for B2B integration include disintermediation, inventory cycle time reduction, business process optimization, and the use of multiple distribution channels. Barriers include high technology costs, complex standards, and privacy concerns.

Different organizations use different internal semantics to describe their products, part numbers, invoices, and purchase orders. When organizations collaborate, they must understand the external data representation of the standards used for transactions. For example, Hiltrix Corp. uses ontologies for its internal data model while exchanging transactions with partners using XML-based standards.

#### 2.1 External Data Representations
External data representations are used to exchange transactions with partners. XML-based B2B standards, such as cXML and CIDX, define a common agreement among business partners. In our approach, we do not restrict the structure of XML transactions. Organizations can use well-known standards or proprietary solutions. For illustration, we use the cXML standard, which is widely adopted for procurement applications.

#### 2.2 Internal Data Representations
Internal data representations are used within organizations for integrating applications like ERP and CRM systems. Modern approaches use semantic representations, such as ontologies, to better describe data. RDF and OWL standards enable the Web to be a global infrastructure for sharing documents and data, making information search and reuse easier and more reliable.

#### 2.3 XML and OWL Data Representation Differences
The differences between XML and OWL data representations pose challenges for integration. XML provides rich syntax and structure definitions, while OWL provides semantics for knowledge domain modeling. XML describes a labeled tree, whereas OWL uses an RDF triple-based graph. XML's nested tags have implicit, domain-dependent meanings, while OWL makes relationships explicit. XML allows duplicate node names at different levels, but OWL requires unique identifiers. XML supports sequences, while OWL does not impose order on properties. XML supports inheritance through extension or restriction, while OWL supports multiple inheritance and property inheritance. OWL also provides logical constructs for reasoning.

### 3. Challenges, Approaches, and Solution
B2B integration involves integrating different transaction standards, leading to data heterogeneity. Distributed database systems face four types of heterogeneity: system, syntactic, structural, and semantic. In B2B integration, only structural and semantic heterogeneity are relevant. Syntactic heterogeneity is not a concern since XML is used for external transactions.

#### 3.1 Challenges
B2B integration faces challenges related to the heterogeneity of external and internal data representations. Solutions need to address structural and semantic differences. Our approach, implemented in B2BISS, uses heterogeneous mappings to integrate XML and OWL-based data representations, enabling organizations to extend the expressiveness of XML entities by associating them with ontological concepts.

### 4. B2BISS System
B2BISS is a system that enables (semi-)automatic B2B integration by managing and reusing heterogeneous mappings. It helps organizations reduce integration time and cost by providing a flexible and easy-to-use graphical tool. B2BISS is instrumental for rapid and cost-effective B2B integration.

### 8. Conclusions
In conclusion, this paper presents a conceptual approach and its implementation, B2BISS, to integrate external XML-based standards with internal OWL-based data representations in B2B integration. B2BISS addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity, enabling organizations to achieve more effective and efficient B2B integration.
