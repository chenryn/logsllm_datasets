Abstract. XML-based standards have been widely used to enable and
ease Business-to-Business (B2B) integration. Examples of standards in-

conceptualapproach,and its implementation,to integrate external syn-
tactic data representations with organizational internal semantic data
representations by using the notion of heterogeneous mappings which
are established between the two types of representations. The applica-

1 Introduction
Global economies are increasingly becoming networked. The notion of value
chains [39], value nets [35], b-Webs [45], and value networks [36] as concepts
andtoolshavebeenusedtounderstandandanalyzenetworkedindustries.They
are useful instruments for portraying the interconnection of operations, players

cessity of developing Business-to-Business (B2B) solutions for integration [32].
The objective of the integration is to ease the management of transaction-based

interactions between business players that are part of a network to cut costs,
increase revenues, and improve time-to-market [11, 5, 48].

The networked economy [23] requires accounting for the nature of alliances,
the technical infrastructures of players, and the data exchanged in business net-
works.Onceanetworkisdesigned,itispossibletoanalyzethemodeltoidentify
gaps.Oncegapsareknown,implementationplanscanbepreparedtoclosethem.
One important gap to close for achieving a stronger B2B integration is the lack
of a common understanding between external standards and internal organiza-
tional data representations [30]. Developers are still faced with the problem of
understanding the meaning of the information represented in XML-based stan-
dards and establish a correspondence or mapping to the internal OWL-based
data representation of organizations [34, 48]. The manual software coding of
mappings between data models is a time consuming task with high costs.
WSML,WSMOandWSMX[50]usesemanticallyannotatedservicestopro-
mote B2B integration by using data and process integration. Transactions can
be semantically enriched using the WSML ontology language. The infrastruc-
ture enables domain experts to create mappings between XML-based standards
and WSMO ontologies. The mappings are represented in an abstract ontology
mappinglanguage.Whilethisresearchprovidesanimportanttheoreticalcontri-
bution, it reveals a few limitations when it needs to be transposed to real-world
industries settings. On the one hand, the use of non-standard languages to es-
tablishmappingsmaybeconsideredapenaltyfornotallowingitssharingacross
anindustry.Theuseofmorewell-establishedlanguagesandtools(suchasOWL
and XSLT languages and parsers) enables an easier adoption by organizations.
On the other hand, the created mappings cannot be reused. This means that
for each standard, an its variations, used to represent transactions, a new set
of mappings needs to be created. A repository of shared mappings that can be
reused overtime would increase the adoption of the approach. Finally, a more
responsive and customized system that would automatically classify incoming

to fully complete a transformation from instances of one model to instance of
the other model would be more adequate in real-world settings.
In this paper we describe a conceptual approach that allows organizations
to participate in B2B networks using XML-based syntactic standards to sup-
port external transactions while structuring their internal data representations
semantically using semantic languages such as OWL. In our approach, partners
and suppliers can freely exchange syntactic XML-based transactions. Once an
organization receives a syntactic external transaction it is allowed to create an
heterogeneous mapping between its elements and the concepts of an internal se-
mantic model (i.e., an ontology) that describes the organization’s domain. The
conceptual approach to manage heterogeneous mappings has been implemented
with the B2BISS system. B2BISS tackles the problem of information integra-
tion since it fosters aspects such as linguistic and semantic differences to be
reconciliated among disparate data representations [38, 11]. The system allows
organizations to dramatically decrease the time and cost of integration by pro-
viding a flexible and easy to use graphical tool. Such a flexible infrastructure is
instrumental for a rapid and cost-effective B2B integration [37].
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The second section
presents a B2B integration scenario that illustrates the challenge of integrating
external XML-based standards and internal OWL-based data representations.
Section 3 enumerates the challenges, approaches and our solution to the prob-
lem of syntactic (external) to semantic (internal) B2B integration. Section 4 in-
troduces the B2BISS system which enables a (semi-)automatic integration and
reliesonthenotionofmanagingandreusingheterogeneousmappings.Section5
describes five organizational scenarios involving the use of the B2BISS system.
Section 6 presents a use case. It describes how B2BISS can be implemented and
used within the SAP NetWeaver Process Integration infrastructure. Section 7
presents the related work in this area. Finally, section 8 closes the manuscript
with our conclusions.
2 B2B integration scenario
Organizations implement B2B infrastructures to allow a seamless interaction
with several business partners that include suppliers, distributors, exporters,
and retailers (see Figure 1). B2B integration ”is not just the buying and selling
of goods and services, but also servicing customers, collaborating with business
partners, and conducting electronic transactions within an organization” [47].
Drivers for B2B network integration include the need for disintermediation, to
reduce inventory cycle time, to optimize business processes, and to use various
distribution channels. On the other hand, barriers to integration are related to
high technology costs, complex technology (OWL, cXML, ebXML, etc), and
confidentiality and privacy concerns.
One very important aspect that needs to be recognized is that different
organizations use different internal semantics to describe their products, part

numbers, invoices, and purchase orders. Therefore, when organizations are col-
laborating in business networks they have to understand the external data rep-
resentation of the standards adopted to represent transactions. Then, when an
organization receives a transaction, it needs to map its data to its own internal
datarepresentation.InFigure1itispossibletofindtwotypesofdatarepresen-
tations: external and internal. The central organization, named Hiltrix Corp.,
uses ontologies for its data model while it exchanges transactions with suppliers
and customers using XML-based standards.
2.1 External data representations
External data representations are used with partners to exchange transactions.
In general, every industry develops standards in order for companies to use
transactions to communicate with each other. With the advent of the eXtensi-
ble Markup Language (XML), it became easier to define and standardize the
contents of B2B transactions. XML is a highly flexible, ubiquitous data format,
designed for multiple representations.
In progress of time, B2B solutions went through an evolutionary path from
monolithic and proprietary standards (e.g. TRADACOMS in UK, ANSI ASC
X.12 in U.S.A and UN/EDIFACT in the United Nations) towards flexible and
standardized XML-based stacks covering the requirements from different indus-
tries [30]. Examples of existing standards to communicate with partners include
cXML, CIDX, ebXML, XML/EDIFACT, papiNet, PIDX, and xCBL [8, 6].
XML-based B2B standards generally define a common agreement among
business partners on transactions for inter-organization integration. In our ap-
proach, we do not make any restriction on the structure of XML transactions
5
exchanged between organizations. As illustrated in Figure 1, organizations can
rely on the use of well-known standards such as cXML and CIDX or use propri-
etary solutions (represented with label X1/XML). For the examples illustrated
in this paper, we use the cXML standard since it is the most widely adopted
B2B protocol. It is intended to exchange transactions between procurement ap-
plications, buyers, suppliers and e-commerce hubs. Nowadays, this protocol is
supported by more than fifty international players, including Visa, AMD, Cisco
Systems and GM. Some of the procurement systems that implement cXML are
the Ariba’s eCommerce platform, Peregrine Systems and Oracle Exchange plat-
form.Thesesystemsallowuserstosearchandlocatebuyersandsellersofgoods
and services.
Listing 3 illustrates a simplified example of an cXML purchase order [13].
The transaction orders 10 units of Poland Spring water at $1.20 each, 20 units
ofScottextissuesat$1.05,and30eightpack(P83)ofMinuteMaidFrozenjuices
at $4.55 each pack. The UNSPSC [22] classification code for Water is 50202301,
for Tissues is 12352206 and the code for Frozen juices is 50202303. The total
order amount is of $66.80 and it is to be shipped and billed to Aldo Corp.
located in Sunnyvale, California.

EmergingSemanticWebtechnologies,suchasontologies,canplayanimportant
role in this scenario [12, 18]. Ontologies are a formal and explicit specification
of a shared conceptualization which can enable semantic interoperability. Due
to the widespread importance of integration for intra- and inter-business net-
works, the research community has tackled this problem and developed seman-
tic standards such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web
Ontology Language (OWL) [1]. RDF and OWL standards enable the Web to
be a global infrastructure for sharing both documents and data, which makes
searchingandreusinginformationeasierandmorereliable.Figure2andListing
4 illustrate a simplified version of the internal data representation of purchasing
orders received by the Hiltrix Corporation described using the ontology lan-
guageOWLThePurchasingOrderontologyhasthreeclasses,Order,Part
and Manufacturer. It also has three object properties: hasManufacturer,
hasPart and hasItem. The property hasPart is an inverse property of has-
Manufacturer. Several data properties are present: type, classification,
cost, quantity, packaging, and www.
3 As an example of the elements of the purchase order, the tag UnitOfMeasure of
the cXML specification describes how the product is packaged or shipped. It must
conform to UN/CEFACT Unit of Measure Common Codes. P8 stands for an eight
pack packaging. For a list of UN/CEFACT codes, see www.unetrades.net.

The objective of the work presented in this paper is to propose a solution to
integrate the external data representation from Listing 3 with the internal data
representation of Listing 4 while having as requirement the minimization of the
cost and time needed to carry out their integration. In other words, the goal is
to integrate XML and OWL-based data representations.
2.3 XML and OWL data representation differences
Thedifferentiationofexternalandinternaldatarepresentationformatsresultsin
asetofchallengesthatneedtobeaddressedinordertoenabletheirintegration.
PreviousresearchhasstudiedthedifferencesbetweenXMLschemaandontology
representation languages [27, 21]. The most important differences between the
two data representations which are relevant to consider for our work are the
following:
– XML provides a rich syntax and structure definitions for data modeling,
and it is generally used to define document structures. On the other hand,
OWL provides semantics for knowledge domain modeling (e.g. healthcare,
bioinformatics, information systems integration).
– ThedatamodelofXMLdescribesanodelabeledtree,whilethedatamodel
ofOWLisagraphbuildonRDFtriples(relatingasubject,apredicate,and
an object).
– Since XML describes a labeled tree, the meaning of nested tags is implicit
and domain dependent. A nested tag can represent a ”part-of” relationship
ora”subtype-of”relationship.InOWL,thesetypesofrelationshipsaremade
explicit with the notion of ”class”, ”subclass” and ”property”.
– In XML, two distinct nodes with the same name can co-exist at different
levels in the labeled tree. This is not allowed in OWL. Every resource needs
a unique identifier. Therefore, instances of classes need to obtain an auto-
matically generated identifier.
– XML allows the definition of sequences to describe the order between ele-
ments. OWL does not support or impose any order on OWL properties.
– XML only supports inheritance using type derivation by extension or re-
striction.Ontheotherhand,OWLsupportsmultiple-inheritance.OWLalso
supports inheritance on properties.

– OWL provides simple logics on relationships for reasoning such as transitiv-
ity, disjunction, conjunction and symmetry.
In the view of the fact that our work aims at mapping external XML trans-
actions into an existing internal OWL-based data representation, the aspects
which are more important to consider are the ones specific to XML. Each XML
element needs to be mapped to a suitable OWL concept.
Since XML does not allow capturing logical constructs such as conjunction,
disjunction,negation,existentialanduniversalquantifiers,mappingsofthistype
cannotbetheorizedfromXMLtoOWL.InXML,semanticsaremostoften”hid-
den”andnotexplicitlydescribedindatarepresentations,residingindevelopers’
minds or domain standard specifications. Nonetheless, while they are not used
inXML,thoselogicaloperatorsareusedbyorganizations(suchasHiltrixCorp.
fromFigure1)whichuseontologiestointerrelateconceptsanddescribedomain
knowledge. To create mappings, users need to inspect ”hidden” or implicit se-
mantics of an XML external data representation and establish a mapping to an
internal ontological concept. As such, ”hidden” semantics and relationships in
XML are made visible in OWL through the use of mappings. While the solu-
tion presented is simple, the management of heterogeneous mappings from an
XML data representation to an ontological data representation enables organi-
zations to extend the expressiveness of XML entities by associating them with
the elements of a conceptualized domain.
3 Challenges, approaches and solution
ThebaseproblemsinherenttothedevelopmentofsolutionsforB2Bintegration
that might arise due to the heterogeneity of external and internal data repre-
sentations are already known within the distributed database community [26].
Nonetheless, as organizations use new representation languages, solutions need
to consider the new particularities introduced.
3.1 Challenges
B2B integration involves the integration of different transaction standards with
different data representations. These differences lead to the notion of data het-
erogeneity. Heterogeneity occurs when there is a disagreement about the mean-
ing, interpretation, or intended use of the same or related data. While with
distributed database systems four types of information heterogeneity may arise
(i.e., system heterogeneity, syntactic heterogeneity, structural or schematic het-
erogeneity,andsemanticheterogeneity),theintegrationofexternaltransactions
and internal data representations suffer only from structural and semantic het-
erogeneity. The problem of syntactic heterogeneity does not occur since, as seen
