Server-side Attacks
The following example shows taking the login information captured in Live HTTP
Headers while attempting to access myspace. The wrong password is switched to
the keyword FUZZ so that WebSlayer knows where to attempt the brute-force. The
Authentication tab has different security options for the example, the authentication
is set to basic with the username joeymuniz followed by the keyword FUZZ.
You basically input the website, user agent, content, and known username. You
add the keyword FUZZ where passwords are required and select a dictionary to
brute-force those login spaces. This is an easy way to automate a brute-force against
a web server.
myspace uses stronger authentication than the example provided.
Targets with security features such as account locking will most likely not be
vulnerable to this tool. Advanced security tools such as the IPS/IDS technology would
most likely be alerted if your targeted were a monitored asset. For these reasons, we
caution against using WebSlayer on live targets without doing proper Reconnaissance.

WebSlayer offers the ability to export payloads and findings into the text and HTML
formats. The logfile can also be captured and pasted into a text file.
Cracking passwords
Passwords are the most common method users verify authentication to systems. It
is common to identify passwords that can access other systems while exploiting a
target system. Chapter 4, Client-side Attacks, provides a section dedicated to cracking
passwords with many tools available in Kali. The next section will touch upon
cracking passwords showcasing a very popular tool available in Kali.
John the Ripper
John the Ripper is the most popular password cracker that is used today. It has
several engines that allow it crack different types of passwords, including encrypted
and hashed passwords. John the Ripper has the ability to autodetect most hashes and
encrypted passwords making the process easier for Penetration Testers. Attackers
like the tool because it is very customizable and can be configured in a variety of
different ways to speed-up password cracking.
[ 119 ]

Server-side Attacks
John the Ripper operates in the following manner:
• Attempts cracking passwords with dictionary words
• Uses dictionary words with alphanumeric characters appended
and prepended
• Puts dictionary words together
• Adds alphanumeric characters to combine words
• Runs dictionary words with special characters mixed in
• When all else fails, attempts brute-force
Best practice is updating the default dictionary. We found the default wordlist is
limited (around 3115 words) and in many cases won't crack common passwords.
You can find dictionaries by searching Google. To verify the size of a new a wordlist,
open a terminal and issue the word count command, once the file is loaded to the
active folder. That command is wc -1 FILENAME.
It is common to have duplicate words when downloading and combining multiple
words lists from the Internet. It's recommended to remove duplicates as well as any
uppercase letters since John toggles case styles automatically. An example of the
command to remove uppercase words is:
tr A-Z a-z  AllLowerCaseFile
An example of the command to remove duplicates is:
sort -u AllLowerCaseFile > NoDuplicatesOrUpperCase
Verify the new word count by issuing the word count command on your new file:
wc -1 NoDuplicatesOrUpperCase
To open John the Ripper in Kali, go under Password Attacks | Offline Attacks and
select John. A command-line terminal will open.
Johnny is a GUI for John the Ripper. Johnny is covered in Chapter 4,
Client-side Attacks.
You can benchmark the speed of John the Ripper by typing john -test to get an
idea of how fast it will run.
[ 120 ]

Chapter 3
To use a custom word file such as the one built in the previous example called
NoDuplicatesOrUpperCase, you will need to edit the default wordlist. This can be
found by editing the file john.conf under the default John the Ripper folder. In
that file, you will find the wordlist pointing to a default passwords.lst.
Change the file list to the name of your new wordlist file. Following the previous
example, you would change it to Wordlist = NoDuplicatesOrUpperCase.lst. The
new wordlist file must be in the folder specified in the john.conf file. The default is
listed under the $JOHN directory.
To use John the Ripper on a password file, you will first need to copy the target file
to the John directory. Issue the copy command cp to move the file into the John
directory. For example, to copy a shadow file (a common password file found in
Linux systems) type cp /etc/shadow.
Once the file is in the same directory as John the Ripper, issue the command john
and the filename. So to run John the Ripper on a file shadow, type john shadow.
You can check the progress of John the Ripper by pressing Enter, which will display
the current password being guessed as well as the cracks per second listed as c/s.
You can pause John the Ripper by pressing CTRL and C keys together. If you restart
John by issuing john FILE, it will resume where you last paused the file.
To see the results once John the Ripper finishes, type john -show FILE. So to see the
results of the shadow file, type john -show shadow.
You can find more information on John the Ripper such as other commands at
http://www.openwall.com/.
Man-in-the-middle
A man-in-the-middle attack by standard definition is a form of active eavesdropping
by having an attacker make independent connections with victims. The most
common form of man-in-the-middle attacks are between host systems. Not too
long ago, a vulnerability was found that abused the system that moves people from
insecure to secure web pages. This gives attackers the ability to eavesdrop on users
connecting to secure web servers. The next section will cover that vulnerability.
Common man-in-the-middle attacks will be covered in later chapters in this book.

Server-side Attacks
SSL strip
In 2009 security researcher Moxie Marlinspike at DefCon released SSL strip. He
introduced the concept of SSL stripping, a man-in-the-middle attack in which a
network attacker proxies HTTPS requests from the user, instead sending the traffic
via HTTP, which can be intercepted and manipulated. SSL strip automates the attack
and allows someone to intercept traffic intended for a secure website. The HTTP
strict transport security specification was subsequently developed to combat these
attacks, however deployment of HSTS has been slow, and SSL stripping attacks are
still widely used today.
For the purposes of this section, we will only be using a single interface; however,
your virtual machine might be configured with multiple Ethernet interfaces. We
will need to check if there are multiple (virtual) Ethernet interfaces enabled.
In the upper left-hand corner of the desktop, click on the Xterm link to open
a command terminal. Use ifconfig to determine what interfaces are on the
virtual machine.
The command is ifconfig | grep "eth". This command will filter-out all the
miscellaneous interfaces and just show us the Ethernet interfaces, as follows:
If we have more than one interface enabled, issue the command ifdown with the
interface name to disable it. For example, there are interfaces named eth0 and eth1,
issue the command Ifdown eth0 to disable the eth0 interface. You will disable your
non-active interface.

Chapter 3
In order to run the SSL strip man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, you need two
pieces of information. First, you need the IP address of the target. Second, you
need the IP address of the router that acts as the subnet gateway. Since this attack
method is only effective from the same layer 2 segments as the target, we will
need to ascertain our own default gateway. To do this, we will need to utilize
the command terminal once again.
In your terminal session issue the following command:
route –n
Or the filtered shell command route -n | grep 'UG' | awk '{print $2}' will
return just the default gateway.
Starting the attack – redirection
Before we can begin collecting information such as user credentials from SSL sessions,
we need to get a few tasks accomplished. We need to start the facilities that allow us
to redirect network traffic. In addition, we need to redirect traffic captured by our
attacking host so that we may forward the user packets to SSL strip. To do this, we
need to enable IP forwarding in Iptables and Arpspoof.
[ 123 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Server-side Attacks
The next three steps will configure IP forwarding, arpspoof redirection,
and configure port redirection. These commands are all the executed from
command-line terminal. Enabling IP Forwarding:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
For the purposes of this example, we will need to know the victim/target host's IP
address. This is to avoid contention and ARP address flooding to the entire network
by all the attack hosts. In a real attack scenario, it might be ideal to run arpspoof
against the entire layer 2 segment (this is the default if the victim's IP is omitted)
and/or utilize packet capturing and sniffing in order to determine the victim IP.
In an environment with many hosts this might cause the flow of traffic to slow and
potentially jeopardize the attacker's ability to remain unnoticed. The command is:
arpspoof -i eth0 -t victimip default_gateway_ip
It is recommended that you do not send this process to the background and leave
the window up. Just start a new terminal session.
Setting up port redirection using Iptables
This enables the attacker to grab traffic destined for an HTTP server on TCP 80 and
redirect to the SSL strip listener port. In this example, redirection will be on TCP
10000 for both destination port and redirect destination. The attacker can use any
applicable value. The redirect destination chosen here must also be used for setting
the listener port for SSL strip. The command is as follows:
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT
--to-ports 10000
[ 124 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
To disable the PREROUTING rule, replace the –A with –D to clear all table
rules use.
iptables –t nat –F #to flush
iptables –t nat –L #to check
arpspoof has many options. You can use the command man iptables
see additional options.
Now you should be set and ready to begin capturing using SSL strip!
Launch sslstrip and from the newly opened command-line window, run the
following command to start SSL strip listening on port TCP 10000:
sslstrip –l 10000

Server-side Attacks
From the target host, browse to an online mail service such as
https://www.hotmail.com and log in.
Using the application menu shortcut to the SSLStrip directory, open another
Terminal window and type the following command:
This should now show you the results of the SSL strip attack.

Summary
This chapter explained various methods to compromise vulnerable web servers
using tools available in Kali. The most common methods are identifying known
vulnerabilities with automated tools and exploiting the best possible path to
gaining access to the target system.
The chapter started off focusing on various tools used to identify vulnerabilities.
The next topic covered was tools used to exploit vulnerabilities found on common
servers as well as servers hosting e-mail services. Next, we focused on brute-forcing
tools that could access data from systems that are not vulnerable to known exploits.
We concluded touching upon password cracking and man-in-the-middle attacks;
however, these subjects have dedicated sections in later chapters.
The next chapter will focus on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities found
on host systems, also known as client devices.
[ 127 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
www.it-ebooks.info
Client-side Attacks
The term client or host means an endpoint used to connect to a network, such as a
computer, a tablet, or a mobile device. A client may offer information, services, and
applications to other clients or obtain information from another system, such as a
server. Typically, the term client refers to endpoints used by people. Having people
involved opens a range of possible vulnerabilities.
Client-side attacks, as it pertains to web applications, is viewed as a method to
identify who is connecting to web applications, what vulnerabilities exist on those
systems, and whether those systems can be a means to gain access or information
from a web application. The focus of this chapter will be identifying systems
accessing web applications, evaluating systems for vulnerabilities, and exploiting
those vulnerabilities, if possible. This chapter will focus heavily on compromising
passwords, as they are the most common methods used to secure host systems.
This chapter will kick-off by covering how to attack hosts using social engineering.
Later, we will look at how to identify vulnerabilities on host systems so that you can
exploit those vulnerabilities using tools covered in other sections of this book. We
will conclude with attacking passwords, because they are the most common means
to secure host systems.
Social engineering
Humans will always be your weakest links for a target's security posture. The
more you try to control the end users, the more they will try to bypass policies.
The less controls you put in place, the less likely that the policies will be followed.
This creates a double-edge sword when deciding how to protect end users from
cyber threats. Hackers know this and target end users in various ways that focus
on compromising a key characteristic of the average user, which is trust.
www.it-ebooks.info
Client-side Attacks
Social engineering is the art of manipulating people into performing actions of
divulging information. Many client-side attacks are based on tricking an end user
into exposing their systems to an attack. Social engineering can range from calling
somebody while pretending to be an authorized employee to posting a link on
Facebook that claims to be a service while really being a means to compromise
the client.
Best practices for launching a successful social engineering attack is taking the time
to understand your target; meaning learn how the users communicate and attempt
to blend into their environment. Most social engineering attacks that fail tend to be
written in a generic format, and they don't include a strong hook to attract the victim,
such as a poorly written e-mail claiming the user is entitled to unclaimed funds.
Using social media sources such as Facebook is a great way to learn about a target,
such as what hobbies and speaking patterns targets favor. For example, developing
traps based on discounted sports tickets would be ideal if a Facebook profile of a
target is covered with the sports team logos.
Because most client-side attacks leverage social engineering, the next section will
explore a popular social engineering arsenal available in Kali.
Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)
The Social Engineer Toolkit (SET) was created and written by the founder of
TrustedSec. It is an open-source Python-driven tool aimed at Penetration Testing
using social engineering. SET is an extremely popular tool used by security
professionals to test an organization's security posture. Real-life attackers use SET
to craft active and malicious attacks. It is the tool of choice for the most common
social engineering attacks.
To launch SET, go to the following link of the menu bar Exploitation Tools | Social
Engineering Tools, and select se-toolkit.
The first time you launch SET on Kali, SET will display the SET distribution updates
directly from GitHub. You will be presented with the option of receiving updates
automatically. Select yes to receive automatic updates.
[ 130 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 4
SET will ask you to verify that git is installed. Kali comes with git preloaded;
however, best practice is following the steps in Chapter 1, Penetration Testing and
Setup, to update Kali. Updates will include a version of git required for SET to work.
Kali 1.0 doesn't include the .git directory. To update, you should follow the
following steps:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to cd /usr/share.
2. Backup the old set directory by typing mv set backup.set.
3. Re-download SET from GitHub using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit/
set/
4. Salvage the old config file to avoid having to set the MSF's path using:
cp backup.set/config/set_config set/config/set_config

Client-side Attacks
5. Verify that SET works using the command se-toolkit.
Using SET to clone and attack
Now that you understand some of the basic dynamics of how SET works, let's
compromise a client machine using a website they might trust. Although we can
use any website, we recommend something that is simple.
Here is an example of cloning a corporate SharePoint site with the intention of
exploiting the victim by loading a meterpreter. In reality, it can be any website you
want to compromise. We chose a SharePoint site because as a Penetration Tester you
will most likely want to use a target that will achieve your goal. Many attackers for
nefarious purposes may use a public website to clone.
[ 132 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 4
The next step is launching SET by going to Exploitation Tools | Social Engineering
Toolkit | se-toolkit.
Once you accept all the licenses and terms of services, you will see the main screen
for SET.
[ 133 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Client-side Attacks
It is recommended to select the 5) Update the Social-Engineer Toolkit option prior
to using SET. Once updated, select option 1) Social-Engineering Attacks. The
next screenshot shows the different website attack vectors available under Social-
Engineering Attacks in SET. The spear-phishing option is a popular attack offering
the ability to embed attacks into e-mails and PDFs. The spear-phishing attack sends
the attack files through a spoofed e-mail originated by the victim directly from SET.
For this example, we will select Website Attack Vectors, because we previously
cloned a website for a website-based attack. Next, we need to determine how to
deliver the payload. There are several options available. Choose the Java Applet
Attack, which is normally option 1.
[ 134 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 4
SET will ask if you would like to use an existing template that comes with SET, or
if you would like to clone a website. The default templates are not good, and it is
recommended to clone a website such as the SharePoint example previously provided.
On the next screen, SET will present several options on how the user can copy
the website. In this example, we will use the site-cloner option. Select site-cloner,
and SET will provide a series of questions. These questions will walk you through
cloning a website and having it run from Kali. Site-Cloner will request the following:
• NAT/Port forwarding: This option tends to confuse people. SET is asking
if the victims will connect to your machine using the IP address configured
on your Kali server or if the victims will connect to a different IP address
