When the same `[router-link]` is clicked multiple times, multiple history
entries are created with the exact same URL. Would it be possible to compare
the current URL of the page to the destination URL, and not call pushState if
the URL is already correct?
From a user perspective, if I am on page A and click a link to page B, then
click the link to page B again, I should only have to press the back button
once to get back to page A.
