### Ping Command

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `ping` command is used to verify IP-level connectivity to another TCP/IP computer by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo Request messages. The receipt of corresponding echo Reply messages, along with round-trip times, is displayed. This command is the primary tool for troubleshooting connectivity, reachability, and name resolution issues in TCP/IP networks.

**Usage:**
- Without parameters, the `ping` command displays Help content.
- You can use this command to test both the computer name and the IP address of the target. If pinging the IP address is successful but pinging the computer name fails, you may have a name resolution problem. Ensure that the computer name can be resolved through the local Hosts file, Domain Name System (DNS) queries, or NetBIOS name resolution techniques.

**Note:**
This command is available only if the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is installed as a component in the properties of a network adapter in Network Connections.

**Syntax:**
```sh
ping [/t] [/a] [/n count] [/l size] [/f] [/I TTL] [/v TOS] [/r count] [/s count] [{/j hostlist | /k hostlist}] [/w timeout] [/R] [/S srcaddr] [/4] [/6] [target]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/t**: Continuously sends echo Request messages to the destination until interrupted. Press `CTRL+ENTER` to interrupt and display statistics, or `CTRL+C` to interrupt and quit.
- **/a**: Performs reverse name resolution on the destination IP address. If successful, `ping` displays the corresponding host name.
- **/n count**: Specifies the number of echo Request messages to send. The default is 4.
- **/l size**: Specifies the length, in bytes, of the Data field in the echo Request messages. The default is 32, and the maximum size is 65,527.
- **/f**: Sets the Do not Fragment flag in the IP header to 1 (available on IPv4 only). The echo Request message cannot be fragmented by routers in the path to the destination. Useful for troubleshooting Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) problems.
- **/I TTL**: Specifies the Time To Live (TTL) value in the IP header for echo Request messages. The default is the host's default TTL value, and the maximum is 255.
- **/v TOS**: Specifies the Type Of Service (TOS) value in the IP header for echo Request messages (available on IPv4 only). The default is 0, and TOS is specified as a decimal value from 0 to 255.
- **/r count**: Uses the Record Route option in the IP header to record the path taken by the echo Request and Reply messages (available on IPv4 only). Each hop in the path uses an entry in the Record Route option. Specify a count equal to or greater than the number of hops between the source and destination. The count must be at least 1 and no more than 9.
- **/s count**: Uses the Internet timestamp option in the IP header to record the time of arrival for the echo Request and Reply messages for each hop. The count must be at least 1 and no more than 4. Required for link-local destination addresses.
- **/j hostlist**: Uses the Loose Source Route option in the IP header with the set of intermediate destinations specified in `hostlist` (available on IPv4 only). Successive intermediate destinations can be separated by one or multiple routers. The maximum number of addresses or names in the host list is 9.
- **/k hostlist**: Uses the Strict Source Route option in the IP header with the set of intermediate destinations specified in `hostlist` (available on IPv4 only). The next intermediate destination must be directly reachable. The maximum number of addresses or names in the host list is 9.
- **/w timeout**: Specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait for the echo Reply message. If the reply is not received within the timeout, a "Request timed out" error message is displayed. The default timeout is 4000 (4 seconds).
- **/R**: Traces the round-trip path (available on IPv6 only).
- **/S srcaddr**: Specifies the source address to use (available on IPv6 only).
- **/4**: Forces the use of IPv4 to ping. This parameter is not required if the target host is identified by an IPv4 address; it is only required to identify the target host by name.
- **/6**: Forces the use of IPv6 to ping. This parameter is not required if the target host is identified by an IPv6 address; it is only required to identify the target host by name.
- **target**: Specifies the host name or IP address of the destination.
- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Example Output:**
```sh
C:\>ping example.microsoft.com
Pinging example.microsoft.com [192.168.239.132] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.239.132: bytes=32 time=101ms TTL=124
Reply from 192.168.239.132: bytes=32 time=100ms TTL=124
Reply from 192.168.239.132: bytes=32 time=120ms TTL=124
Reply from 192.168.239.132: bytes=32 time=120ms TTL=124
```

**Examples:**

1. **Ping the destination 10.0.99.221 and resolve its host name:**
   ```sh
   ping /a 10.0.99.221
   ```

2. **Ping the destination 10.0.99.221 with 10 echo Request messages, each with a Data field of 1000 bytes:**
   ```sh
   ping /n 10 /l 1000 10.0.99.221
   ```

3. **Ping the destination 10.0.99.221 and record the route for 4 hops:**
   ```sh
   ping /r 4 10.0.99.221
   ```

4. **Ping the destination 10.0.99.221 and specify the loose source route of 10.12.0.1-10.29.3.1-10.1.44.1:**
   ```sh
   ping /j 10.12.0.1 10.29.3.1 10.1.44.1 10.0.99.221
   ```
