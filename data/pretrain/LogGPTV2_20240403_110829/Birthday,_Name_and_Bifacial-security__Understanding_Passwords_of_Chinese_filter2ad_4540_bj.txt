that Chinese passwords have a vastly different letter
distribution, structure and semantic patterns as compared
to English passwords, and thus when targeting a Chinese
password, it is crucial for cracking algorithms to be
trained on datasets from Chinese sites. Such sites should
also have the same password creation policy and the
same (or a similar) service type as the target site.

Secondly, for PCFG-based attacks, when the training
set is sufﬁciently large (e.g., over 1M as ours), besides
the D and S-segments, it is better to also directly learn
the L-segments of guesses from the training set. This
can be well established by the fact that, given the same
guess numbers and against the same test sets, our PCFG-
based attacks can obtain much higher success rates (see
Sec. 4.1) than those of the PCFG-based attacks in [34,58]
where external dictionaries are used to instantiate the L-
segments. This practice has been recommended by Ma
et al. [36], but they did not specify when to apply it.
Further, one may include some external semantic dict-
ionaries to instantiate the L and D-segments as we do.
Thirdly, as compared to Markov-based attacks, PCFG-
based ones are simpler to implement (31% less com-
putation and 70% less memory cost), and they perform
equally well, or even better, when the guess number is
small (e.g. 103, see Figs. 4 and 6). For large guess
numbers, order-4 Markov attacks are the best choices.
As far as we know, these observations have not been
elucidated in previous major studies [15, 36]. Note that,
we have only shown the Markov-based cracking results
when the guess number is below 107. There is potential
that order-3 Markov-based attacks will outperform order-
4 and 5 ones at larger guess numbers (e.g., 1014).
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we performed a large-scale empirical anal-
ysis of 73.1 million real-world Chinese web passwords.
In our empirical analysis, we systematically explored
several fundamental password properties (e.g., the dis-
tance between passwords and languages, and various
semantic patterns) and uncovered the bifacial-security
nature of Chinese passwords: They are more prone
to online guessing than English passwords; But out
of the remaining Chinese passwords, they are stronger
against ofﬂine guessing. This reconciles two conﬂicting
claims in [7, 26, 34]. We hope this work will help both
security administrators and individual Chinese users to
more informedly secure their password accounts.
