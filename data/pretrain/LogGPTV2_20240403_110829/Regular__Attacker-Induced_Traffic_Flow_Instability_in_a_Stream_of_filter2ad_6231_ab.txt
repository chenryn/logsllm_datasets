attackers, following a modiﬁed control law, are present in
the stream of vehicles, and are located upstream relative to
the active attacker (Figure 2). Passive attackers have gains
intentionally designed to cause oscillation in the desired
acceleration or jerk requirement. The passive attacker vehicles
are assumed to be colluding with the active attacker (though
vehicle operators might be unknowing participants, as a
result of local/remote exploit, in the attack). Attackers are
not necessarily rational and their motivations could include
maliciousness, selﬁshness, or terrorism. A possible outcome
could be to produce congestion that would prevent emergency
vehicles from reaching their destination in a timely manner
in responding to an attack. All other vehicles in the trafﬁc
system are considered victim vehicles. All vehicles have the
same capabilities. Likely government mandates will require
vehicle-to-vehicle communication in future vehicles [34] and
the recent Jeep recall to address a remote exploit vulnerability
[35] substantiates the possibility that such outward facing
interfaces could allow attackers to effect the changing of gains
remotely and thus not be directly implicated in an attack.
Colluding passive attackers are placed advantageously in
the trafﬁc system prior to beginning an attack. In this manner
a desired density of passive attackers versus victims can be
achieved. The attackers could communicate amongst themselves
to coordinate the attack. In the case of unintentional participants
the malicious control law will be remotely activated. We make
the assumption that the active attacker has manipulated the
trafﬁc system to obtain a desirable trafﬁc density where the

vehicles are operating at the minimum steady state inter-vehicle
distance allowed by their individual control laws.
The goals of the attackers are: 1) to introduce instability by
modifying the elements of A (Equation 2) corresponding to
each attacker so as to produce an unstable system, and then
perturb the system to ensure the system is forced out of steady
state equilibrium, and 2) to introduce global string instability
by introducing passive attackers into the system at a density
that will ensure magniﬁcation of errors. The overall effect of
the attack is a reduction in trafﬁc ﬂow stability leading to
stop-and-go jams and driver/passenger discomfort; a secondary
affect is the possible occurrence of collisions more severe than
if the attackers were to simply apply braking [16].
III. TRAFFIC FLOW STABILITY
To begin a discussion regarding the stability of the LTI
system of (2) several deﬁnitions will be drawn from traditional
linear systems theory, as detailed by [36].
Deﬁnition 1 (Marginal and Asymptotic Stability): The LTI
system ˙x = Ax is said to be marginally asymptotically stable if,
for every initial condition x(t0) = x0, the state-space response
x(t) = Φ(t, t0)x0, ∀t ≥ 0, where Φ(t, t0) is the state transition
matrix, and is uniformly bounded. The system is asymptotically
stable if Φ(t, t0) ⇒ 0 as t ⇒ ∞.
The LTI system is both marginally and asymptotically stable
if all the eigenvalues of A have negative real part [36].
Deﬁnition 2 (Marginal Stability): The equation ˙x = Ax is
said to be marginally stable if all the eigenvalues of A have
zero or negative real parts and those with zero real parts are
simple roots of the minimal polynomial of A.
If A has multiple complex pairs of eigenvalues with zero real
part these eigenvalues will not be simple roots of the system.
Therefore the system is not marginally stable but unstable [36].
Deﬁnition 3 (String Stability): A stream, or string, of
implicitly cooperative vehicles is said to be string stable when
any non-zero position, speed, or acceleration errors of any
individual vehicle are not ampliﬁed as they propagate upstream
(toward the rear of the system).
A system of cooperative automated vehicles must be string
stable to ensure errors do not amplify causing oscillation, trafﬁc
jams, or collisions. In the analysis that follows we prove that by
a modiﬁcation of gains attackers can introduce both instability
and global string instability into the stream of vehicles. Similar
to [19] and [16], we assume the same time headway h, and
gain kp are shared by all vehicles, attackers and victims alike.
A. String Stability Criterion
The string stability condition (Deﬁnition 3) states that
spacing and velocity errors between vehicles should attenuate
as they move upstream. To analyze error propagation and
stability it is useful to represent error between the ith and ith+1
explicitly utilizing error coordinates as described by [19].

B. Instability
In the following we prove that an attacker can affect stability
by changing their gains and subsequently the eigenvalues of
A.
1) A System of Implicitly Cooperative Vehicles: Consider
the following state-space equations, which represent a hetero-
geneous system of cooperative automated vehicles, where the
highest order derivative is simply a function of other states
and can represent any LTI unidirectional control law:
˙x1 = v1
˙v1 = f (x2, x1, ˙x1, ˙x2)
˙x2 = v2
˙v2 = f (x3, x2, ˙x2, ˙x3)
...
˙xn−1 = vn−1
˙vn−1 = f (xn, xn−1, ˙xn−1, ˙xn)
˙xn = vn
˙vn = u.
(7)
The system of (7) can be represented by a cascaded system
of transfers functions. The output from one transfer function
being the input to the next, each transfer function contributing
to the eigenvalues of the larger system.
Lemma 1: The heterogeneous cooperative automated vehicle
system represented by Equation 7 cannot be stable if the real
part of a single eigenvalue of A is greater that zero. An attacker
can judiciously select gains associated with their control law

that will cause A to have at least one eigenvalue with a zero or
positive real part, and therefore make the cooperative system
unstable.
Proof 1: Without loss of generality the system of (7) can
be expressed as a cascaded system of transfer functions
G1(s), G2(s), . . . , Gn−1(s), Gn(s), where:
Gi(s) =
Zi(s)
Zi+1(s)
, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
(8)
is the error coordinate transfer function of the ith vehicle in
the system. Assuming an n vehicle system the input to the
ith vehicles transfer function Gi(s) is the error state Zi+1(s),
representing measured position and velocity error relative to
the (i+1)th vehicle and its predecessor the (i+2)th vehicle. The
output of Gi(s) is Zi(s), the measured position and velocity
error relative to the current vehicle and its predecessor the
(i + 1)th vehicle. More generally the error measurements could
include any measurable states required by a particular vehicles
control law.
The transfer function Gi(s) of the ith vehicle can be expressed
in terms of the poles and zeros it contributes to the system of
Equation 7:
Gi(s) =
Zi(s)
Zi+1(s)
=
Ni(s)
Di(s)
, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
(9)
where Ni and Di represent the numerator and denominator,
respectively, of the transfer function. If Gi(s) is a strictly proper
transfer function the roots of Di(s) determine the stability of
the impulse response [36]. If a single real root, or real and
complex conjugate pair of roots, are unstable then x(t) ⇒ ∞
as t ⇒ ∞, and the system of (7) will be unstable.
Assuming an attacker is using the system of Control
Algorithm 1 and Equation 1, which is expressed as an
error coordinate transfer function in Equation 5, by choosing
kd = −kph:
Diatk
(s) = s2+(kph+kd)s+kp = s2+kp =⇒ s = 0±j
kp
(10)
a marginally stable complex pair of eigenvalues have been
added to the system. By choosing kd ≤ −kph, a complex pair
of unstable eigenvalues will be added to the system. Because
the roots of Diatk
(s) are independent of surrounding vehicles
a heterogeneous mixture of vehicles can be destabilized.
(cid:4)
This ensures that x(t) ⇒ ∞ as t ⇒ ∞, ∴ ∀kdatk
Referring to Deﬁnition 2, if more than one attacker with
marginally stable eigenvalues is present in the system these
eigenvalues will not be simple roots of the system. Therefore
the system is not marginally stable but unstable.
 1 global string
instability can be achieved; this is a function of n, the number
of victim vehicles in the subsystem. In other words by judicious
placement within a trafﬁc system and proper gain selection,
a density of attackers can ensure errors are magniﬁed toward
the rear of the stream despite the fact that victim gains have
been designed to ensure attenuation of errors.
The larger trafﬁc system can be expressed as a multiplicity of
the subsystem of (12). As a general case each victim and each
attacker utilize different control laws and gains resulting in a

gain of the system can be expressed as:

|Gsys(s)| =
If the attackers are using stable, but not string stable gains,
and |Gsys(s)| > 1 the system is globally string unstable. The
attackers can choose unstable gains (for example if Control
Algorithm 1 is being used, kd ≤ −kph) and, as detailed in the
proof for Lemma 1, the system will be globally unstable. For
our analysis we choose a special case where attackers use the
same control law, all victims use the same control law which is
not necessarily the same as the attackers, and the attackers are
distributed uniformly within the trafﬁc system. The cumulative
gain of this system can be expressed as:
|Gsys(s)| = (|Ga(s)||Gv(s)|n)N
(14)
to ensure global string stability it is sufﬁcient however to ensure
|Ga(s)||Gv(s)|n > 1. For the sake of simplicity, if we assume
that attackers are uniformly distributed the required attacker
density can be easily calculated as:
ρatk ≥ 1
n
(cid:11)
=⇒ ρatk ≥ ln|Gv(s)|
|Ga(s)|

1
(15)
Equation 14 is general enough to be used with arbitrary attacker
distributions to establish sufﬁcient gains for the individual
vehicles under attacker control.
The density of attackers required to incite global instability,
or string instability depends on the magnitude of attenuation a
victim vehicle can achieve, and ampliﬁcation an attacker can
provide. In the case of a uniform distribution of attackers,
the attenuation (1 − |Gv(s)|) of a victim using Control
Algorithm 1 with kp = 1, h = 1 is shown in Figure 4 for
different values of kd with respect to frequency. We can clearly
establish an upper bound on the attenuation over a range of
attacker frequencies2. For example, the upper bound on victim
attenuation for frequencies below 0.7 rad s−1 is calculated as
1 − 0.8051 = 0.1949 for the data of Figure 4, where 0.8051
is the minimum victim gain for this range.
If an attacker using Control Algorithm 1 chooses gains h =
1, kp = 0.5, kd = −0.45 which are stable but string unstable,
they produce a gain of 16.76 at a frequency of 0.707 rad s−1.

or 7.7% is required to achieve global string instability. In
Section IV-B we discuss how modern safety features of vehicles,
which engage the vehicle’s brakes on behalf of the driver
when a collision is imminent, can be leveraged by attackers to
signiﬁcantly reduce the percentage of compromised vehicles
necessary to effect the attack.
