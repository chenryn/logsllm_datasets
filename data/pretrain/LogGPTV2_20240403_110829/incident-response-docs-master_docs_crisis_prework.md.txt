description: Stress testing your crisis response plan through practice and simulations is essential to identify any gaps or blind spots before a real crisis occurs. This process also helps build strong leadership, reduce response times, and foster good habits within your team.

## Pre-Crisis Preparation

With your Executive Crisis Leadership team in place, your crisis response management configured in PagerDuty, and both a comprehensive 100-page crisis management plan and a concise, scenario-driven playbook, the next step is to stress test your preparations. This is crucial for identifying any gaps or blind spots that could hinder your response during an actual crisis. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to strengthen leadership, reduce mean time to respond, and instill good practices within your team.

## Crisis Simulations

### Discussion-Based Tabletop Exercises

Start by conducting discussion-based tabletop exercises with your team. These exercises are ideal for initial testing and can help you understand how well your team can coordinate and communicate under simulated crisis conditions.

### Functional Exercises

In addition to tabletop exercises, functional exercises are essential for simulating more complex scenarios. These exercises allow you to assess your team's maturity in crisis coordination, command, and control. 

### Running a Simulation with PagerDuty

Using PagerDuty to run a crisis simulation is straightforward. You can trigger an alert on your crisis serviceâ€”randomly if you want to simulate real-life unpredictability. Follow your established process to gather the right people on a conference call or instant messaging channel, and then work through a scenario using your corresponding playbook.

The PagerDuty platform will automatically track the duration of the exercise and record any notes or status changes in the timeline. This data can be invaluable for your postmortem (also known as an after-action report or hotwash) and for developing future tabletops or simulations.

### Frequency and Review

A biannual cadence for crisis simulations is recommended. This schedule allows sufficient time for preparation and thorough review of the findings in the postmortem. Regular simulations ensure that your team remains prepared and that your crisis response plan is continuously refined and improved.
