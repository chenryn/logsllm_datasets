### Cost-Effectiveness and Signal Processing

The G.709 encoded signal operates at approximately 7% higher than the original 10 Gigabit carrier. This signal is transmitted via a laser at a specified wavelength into the first stage multiplexer (MUX). The lambdaMON will capture this signal after it has passed through additional, but optional, stages of multiplexers and amplifiers (AMP), but before it enters the dispersion compensation unit (DCU).

### Inbound Signal Processing

For the inbound direction, all wavelengths (lambdas) pass through one or more stages of the demultiplexer (DEMUX). A single channel, still G.709 encoded, eventually reaches the decoding section of the transponder, where it is converted back into the original SONET/SDH or Ethernet LAN PHY signal.

### Attenuation and Amplification

All passive modules forming a DWDM terminal, such as MUX, DEMUX, and DCU, introduce device-dependent attenuation, typically between 5 dB and 10 dB. However, the operating range of transmitters, receivers, and other system components is typically limited to +5 dBm and -20 dBm. Therefore, signals must be strengthened at least once within the terminal, which is the role of preamplifiers (PRE AMP).

### Instrumentation Point

The instrumentation point at a DWDM terminal requires a fully multiplexed, non-dispersed signal strong enough to tolerate the additional attenuation introduced by fiber optic splitters and lambdaMON components, such as the tunable channel filter (TCL). The optimal location for instrumentation is on the right-hand side of any DCU and past any preamplifiers in the direction of light travel (see Figure 2).

### Fiber Run and Protection Switching

DWDM transmission lines can be built from one or two independent fiber runs. In the event of a fiber cut, the DWDM system will automatically switch from the primary fiber to the secondary within a defined period. Since protection switching is handled at the line amplifier section, the lambdaMON architecture is not affected by whether the network owner chooses to operate in protected mode.

### Modular Design and Deployment

Modern DWDM sites are built in a modular fashion, with similar components found in DWDM terminals also present at optical line amplifier (OLA), regenerator (REGEN), or optical add/drop multiplexer (OADM) sites. The lambdaMON architecture allows for deployment at any of these sites. However, since passive monitors are best operated remotely with a legacy network connection, placing them at OLA or REGEN sites is generally not practical. OADM sites, being similar to DWDM terminals, will support the proposed architecture.

### lambdaMON: Passive Monitoring Facility for DWDM Optical Networks

A lambdaMON is a bidirectional 10 Gigabits/second device capable of collecting and analyzing packet header data at line rate from any active wavelength carrier at a single DWDM link. A multi-feed lambdaMON, or lambdaMON node, is an advanced configuration that allows a lambdaMON to monitor any one (at a time) of a number of DWDM links at a given location.

### Design Considerations

Our design for lambdaMONs and lambdaMON nodes is driven by the following considerations:
1. **Technology Independence**: Break the cycle that causes passive monitors to miss the first 18 months of high-performance network link layer technology.
2. **Utility Demonstration**: Show the utility of passive monitoring systems for troubleshooting and debugging networks, applications, and protocols, especially in the initial years after network rollout.
3. **Workload Profiles**: Retain the ability to collect and analyze workload profiles of mature networks.
4. **Dynamic Monitoring**: Eliminate the need for a static association between network links and monitors, allowing for on-demand and short-notice availability.
5. **Cost and Technical Constraints**: Address cost and technical obstacles by designing a readily available, central facility.

### Architecture Derivation

Based on these constraints, our lambdaMON architecture is derived as follows:
1. **Leverage Existing Technology**: Utilize existing OC192MON technology for loss-free data capture and real-time analysis at 10 Gigabit LAN/WAN PHY and OC192c Packet-over-SONET network links.
2. **Dynamic Tuning**: Address per-link constraints by designing a system that dynamically tunes into any active lambda at a given DWDM link.
3. **Increased Coverage**: Introduce a transparent fiber switch to tap into multiple DWDM links at a site, increasing coverage on a given optical infrastructure.
4. **Scalability**: Provide the option to increase analysis power by adding additional lambdaMONs to the fiber switch, allowing for the analysis of multiple lambdas at a single DWDM link if required.

### Technical Challenges

DWDM is an emerging technology, and some field equipment may not easily support passive fiber splitters, making the engineering effort prohibitive. As an alternative, existing one percent monitoring ports, a standard feature in most equipment, can be used. This avoids service disruption but requires signal amplification by an EDFA, increasing costs. Field tests show that signal levels at one percent monitoring ports vary, and a single-stage amplifier may or may not be sufficient.

Tunable channel filters (TCL) are becoming commercially available but are restricted to C or L bands and have limited selection for stable operation on a 50 GHz grid. TCLs are affordable and reliable, meeting project requirements. Integrating G.709 transponders into OC192MONs, while reducing flexibility, offers significant cost reductions, especially in large-scale rollouts.

### Conclusion

We successfully conducted laboratory tests using a C band setup simulating 600 km of long-distance fiber, terminated by CISCO 15808 terminals. We amplified signals from the one percent monitoring ports in both transmit and receive directions via a CISCO 15501 EDFA, transferring 1.4 Terabytes of data without bit errors or packet drops.

Next, we plan to stage a phase 2 prototype of the lambdaMON, involving a full setup of the lambdaMON node in Los Angeles, with the active support of CENIC. This node may include OC48MON monitoring equipment from the start, as several links are of particular interest.

We are also expanding the passive measurement node concept to traditional SONET-based networking and will continue to publish our progress via the project’s Web site [7].
