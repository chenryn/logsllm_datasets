more  cost  effective.  The  G.709  encoded  signal  operates  at  an  approximately  7  per- 
cent higher rate relative to the original 10 Gigabit carrier and is launched via a laser at 
a specified wavelength into the first stage multiplexer (MUX). It is this signal that the 
lambdaMON will pick up once the signal has passed through additional, but optional, 
stages  of  multiplexers  and  amplifiers  (AMP),  but  before  entering  the  dispersion 
compensation unit (DCU). 
For the inbound direction, all lambdas will pass through one or more stages of the 
demultiplexer  (DEMUX),  with  a  single  channel  (still  G.709  encoded)  eventually 
reaching the decoding section of the transponder, where it will be converted back into 
the original SONET/SDH or Ethernet LAN PHY signal. 
All of the passive  modules  forming a DWDM terminal, such as MUX,  DEMUX 
and DCU, introduce a device dependent attenuation, typically between 5 dB and 10 
dB.  However,  the  operating  range  of  transmitters,  receivers  and  other  parts  of  the 
system is typically limited to between +5 dBm and -20 dBm. Therefore, signals will 
have  to  be  strengthened  at  least  once  within  the  terminal,  which  is  the  role  of 
preamplifiers (PRE AMP). 
The  point  of  instrumentation  at  a  DWDM  terminal  requires  a  fully  multiplexed, 
non-dispersed  signal  that  is  strong  enough  to  tolerate  the  additional  attenuation 
introduced  by  the  fiber  optic  splitter  and  lambdaMON  components,  such  as  the 
tunable channel filter (TCL). Therefore, the exact location to instrument is the right-
hand side of any DCU and past any preamplifiers in the direction of light travel (see 
Figure 2). 
DWDM  transmission  lines  can  be  built  from  just  one,  or  two  independent,  fiber 
runs. In the event of a fiber cut, the DWDM system will, within a defined period of 
time, automatically switch from the primary fiber to the secondary. Since protection 
switching is handled at the line amplifier section of a DWDM terminal or device, the 
lambdaMON  architecture  is  not  affected  by  whether  the  network  owner  chooses  to 
operate in protected mode or not. 
Since modern DWDM sites are built in a modular fashion, similar components as 
are presently found in DWDM terminals will also be present at optical line amplifier 
(OLA),  regenerator  (REGEN)  or  optical  add/drop  multiplexer  (OADM)  sites.  The 
lambdaMON architecture fundamentally permits deploying monitors at any of those 
DWDM  sites,  however,  since  passive  monitors  are  best  operated  remotely  with  a 
legacy  network  connection,  there  is  not  much  point  in  placing  them  at  OLA  or 
REGEN sites. OADM sites are very similar in nature to DWDM terminals and will 
support the proposed architecture. 
lambdaMON – A Passive Monitoring Facility for DWDM Optical Networks

4   lambdaMONs 
A lambdaMON is a bidirectional 10 Gigabits/second device capable of collecting 
and  analyzing  packet  header  data  at  line  rate  from  any  one  (at  a  time)  of  the 
active wavelength carriers at a single DWDM link. 
A  multi-feed 
lambdaMON,  or 
is  an  advanced 
configuration  permitting  a  lambdaMON  to  monitor  any  one  (at  a  time)  of  a 
number of DWDM links at a given location.

Fig. 3. Multi-feed lambdaMON or lambdaMON node 
Our  design  for  lambdaMONs  and  lambdaMON  nodes  is  driven  by  the  following 
considerations: 
1.  We are keen to break the technology dependency cycle that lets passive monitors 
miss the first 18  months of the life cycle of any  high performance  network link 
layer technology. 
2.  We  want 
to  demonstrate 
the  utility  of  passive  monitoring  systems  for 
troubleshooting  and  debugging  of  networks,  applications  and  protocols.  Such  a 
facility is critical within the first year or two after network rollout, much less once 
the network is mature. 
3.  We want to retain the ability to collect and analyze  workload profiles of  mature 
networks.

4.  We  believe  that  there  is  no  strict  need  for  a  static  association  between  network 
links  and  monitors.  It  appears  that  the  community  would  rather  have  a  passive 
monitoring facility available on demand, and possibly on short notice, if and when 
such a requirement arises. 
5.  We  believe  that  the  success  of  passive  monitoring  technologies  has  been 
hampered  by  cost  considerations  as  well  as  technical  obstacles.  We  can  break 
those constraints by designing a readily available facility central to the network. 
Based on those constraints, we derive our lambdaMON architecture as follows: 
1.  Make best use of existing OC192MON technology, which permits loss free data 
capture  and  real-time  analysis  at  10  Gigabit  LAN/WAN  PHY  and  OC192c 
Packet-over-SONET network links. 
2.  Address the per-link constraint (and associated costs) of traditional OC192MON 
deployment  by  designing  a  system  that  will  permit  dynamically  tuning  into  any 
one (at a time) of the active lambdas at a given DWDM link. 
3.  Increase  the  coverage  on  a  given  optical  infrastructure  by  introducing  a 
transparent fiber switch to tap into multiple DWDM links at a site (see Figure 3).

4.  Retain 
increase  analysis  power  by 
introducing  additional 
lambdaMONs to the fiber switch in the future. As opposed to a static per-DWDM-
link  setup,  this  arrangement  will  permit  the  analysis  of  multiple  lambdas  at  a 
single DWDM link, if required. 
5   Technical Challenges 
DWDM is still an emerging technology and some of the equipment in the field today 
may not easily support passive fiber splitters, and the resulting engineering effort may 
turn out to be prohibitive to consider the installation and operation of lambdaMONs. 
As  an  alternative,  existing  one  percent  monitoring  ports,  which  appear  to  be  a 
standard feature  with  most equipment, can be used in replacement for the  fiber tap. 
The advantage is that equipment in the field will not experience any service disruption 
when  installing  lambdaMONs;  however,  on  the  downside,  the  signal  levels  are  too 
low for the operation of fiber optic transceivers and other passive optical equipment. 
Therefore, the signal levels will need to be amplified by an EDFA first, which causes 
an  overall  increase  in  costs.  First  field  tests  have  shown  that  signal  levels  at  one 
percent  monitoring  ports  vary,  and  a  single  stage  amplifier  may  or  may  not  be 
sufficient  to  increase  the  signal  power  level  in  such  a  way  that  a  commercially 
available G.709 transponder can be operated reliably at the expected BER. 
Tunable channel filters (TCL) are just becoming commercially available for field 
deployment, and are restricted to operating in either the C or the L band. In addition, 
the selection of filters that support stable operation on a 50 GHz grid is presently very 
small. Field tests have shown that TCLs come at an affordable price and work reliably 
to the full satisfaction of the project. 
It  appears  to  be  attractive,  from  a  cost  point  of  view,  to  integrate  G.709 
transponders into OC192MONs. Even though there is some loss of flexibility, the cost 
reductions  are  significant,  specifically  in  a  large  scale  rollout,  like  in  a  distributed 
infrastructure.

6   Conclusion 
We have successfully carried out laboratory tests using a C band setup simulating a 
total of 600km of long distance fiber terminated by a pair of CISCO 15808 terminals. 
We amplified signals from the one percent monitoring ports in both the transmit and 
receive  directions  via  a  CISCO  15501  EDFA  and  successfully  transferred  1.4 
Terabytes of data over the course of several hours with varying packet sizes and data 
loads without incurring any bit errors or packet drops. 
Our  next  step,  at  the  time  of  publication,  is  to  stage  a  phase  2  prototype  of  the 
lambdaMON,  which  will  involve  a  full  setup  of  the  lambdaMON  node  in  Los 
Angeles,  with  the  active  support  of  CENIC.  Such  a  node  may  include  OC48MON 
monitoring equipment right from the start, as there are a number of links that are of 
particular interest to us. 
We  are  also  looking  at  expanding  the  passive  measurement  node  concept  to 
traditional SONET-based networking. It is expected that we will continue to publish 
our progress via the project’s Web site [7].
