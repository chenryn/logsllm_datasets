User: I'm using several django instances, each in a virtualenv, on the same 
server. 
How can I start the celery server and make sure it is always running and 
updated? I.e. after a server restart or code update? 
The /etc/init.d script and the config file assume a single Django 
installation. Do I have to use the ./manage.py celeryd command? 
Regards 
Simon
Assistant: If you make changes in tasks.py for celery, then you will have to restart it once to apply changes by running command ./manage.py celeryd start or python manage.py celeryd start --settings=settings for using settings.py as configuration for celery. It will not be affected by the changes in your projects until you make changes in celery configuration.
