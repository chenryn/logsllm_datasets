Figure 2: Growth in Google inter-domain traf-
Ô¨Åc contribution. Graph shows weighted average
percent of all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc contributed by
YouTube and Google ASNs. Over time, Google mi-
grated YouTube traÔ¨Éc and back-end infrastructure
into Google peering / transit and data centers.
Our analysis of traÔ¨Éc data from July 2007 suggests traÔ¨Éc
patterns consistent with that of logical topological textbook
diagrams in Figure 1a. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we Ô¨Ånd the largest Inter-
net providers by inter-domain traÔ¨Éc volume correlate with
the twelve largest transit networks popularly regarded as the
global transit core [29].
In the second chart of Table 2b, we show the impact
of subsequent commercial policy and traÔ¨Éc engineering
changes on the ten largest Internet providers by inter-
domain traÔ¨Éc contribution as of July 2009. We note that the
2009 list includes signiÔ¨Åcant variance from 2007, including
the addition of non-transit companies to the list. SpeciÔ¨Å-
cally, both a content provider (Google) and a consumer net-
work (Comcast) now rival several global transit networks in
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc contribution. Provider A and B con-
tinue to hold the top two spots at 9.4 and 5.7 percent of all
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc, respectively. We discuss both Google
and Comcast in more detail later in this Section.
Table 2c provides another view of the data showing the
gain in providers‚Äô average percentage of all inter-domain
traÔ¨Éc between July 2007 and July 2009. We note that
growth in this table requires a provider gain ‚Äúmarket share‚Äù,
i.e., the provider exceed the overall growth of inter-domain
traÔ¨Éc (currently growing at 35-45% annualized).
Google inter-domain traÔ¨Éc enjoyed the largest growth in
our two year study period by gaining 4% of all inter-domain
traÔ¨Éc. Figure 2 provides the weighted average percent of
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc due to Google ASNs (including proper-
ties) and YouTube (AS36561) between July 2007 and July
2009.
Discussions with providers and analysis of the data in Fig-
ure 2 suggests much of Google‚Äôs traÔ¨Éc share increase came
through the post-acquisition migration of YouTube inter-
domain traÔ¨Éc to Google‚Äôs ASNs (from both LimeLight and
YouTube ASN) [30]. At the start of the study period, both
Google and YouTube represent slightly more than 1% of all
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc. Figure 2 shows YouTube ASN inter-
domain traÔ¨Éc decreasing as Google traÔ¨Éc continues to grow
through the summer of 2009.
ISP A and ISP B also showed signiÔ¨Åcant growth in Ta-
ble 2c. Private discussion with analysts and providers sug-

Table 2: The ten largest contributors of inter-domain traÔ¨Éc by weighted average percentage of all Internet
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc. Includes average percentage of all traÔ¨Éc from study participants originating, terminat-
ing, or transiting the ASNs managed by each provider in July 2007 and July 2009. The third table includes
providers with the most signiÔ¨Åcant inter-domain traÔ¨Éc share growth over the two-year study period.
gest these providers enjoyed growth both due to their CDN
business (ISP A) and role providing transit to large content
providers (both ISP A and ISP B). Comcast also showed sig-
niÔ¨Åcant growth with a gain of close to 2% of all inter-domain
traÔ¨Éc.
We brieÔ¨Çy focus on changes in Comcast‚Äôs inter-domain
traÔ¨Éc contribution as an illustration of possible commercial
policy and traÔ¨Éc engineering changes belying some of the re-
sults in Table 2c. In 2007, we found Comcast inter-domain
traÔ¨Éc share (distributed across a dozen regional ASN) rep-
resented less than 1% of all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc. Also in
2007, Comcast inter-domain traÔ¨Éc patterns resembled that
of most traditional consumer providers with traÔ¨Éc ratios of
7:3, or the majority (70%) of traÔ¨Éc coming into Comcast. In
the language of the industry, Comcast represented a typical
‚Äúeyeball‚Äù consumer network [19, 6].
Figure 3a shows the weighted average percent of all inter-
domain traÔ¨Éc both a) originating or terminating in Comcast
managed ASNs (i.e., origin) and b) transiting Comcast to
reach other ASNs (i.e., transit).
In the summer of 2007,
Comcast origin traÔ¨Éc contributed an average of 0.13% of
all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc ‚Äì a percentage in line with other
large North American cable operators. During the same
time period, Comcast transit traÔ¨Éc represented 0.78% of
all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc. While Comcast origin traÔ¨Éc saw
modest growth over the two year study period, the majority
of Comcast‚Äôs traÔ¨Éc increase stemmed from transit ‚Äì nearly
a 4x growth.
Figure 3b shows another view of the data. We calcu-
late the weighted average percentage of inter-domain traÔ¨Éc
into all Comcast ASNs versus outbound. We use this In
/ Out peering ratio as an approximation of the Comcast‚Äôs
content contribution versus consumption. The graph shows
that over the two year study period Comcast‚Äôs traÔ¨Éc ratios
inverted with the cable operator becoming a net Internet
inter-domain contributor by July of 2009.
Discussions with analysts and ISPs provide some insight
into Comcast‚Äôs transformation. Over the last Ô¨Åve years,
Comcast executed on a number of technology and business
strategies, including consolidation of several disparate re-
gional backbones into a single nationwide network and roll-
out of a ‚Äútriple play‚Äù (voice, video, data) consumer product.
Most signiÔ¨Åcantly, Comcast began oÔ¨Äering wholesale tran-
sit (GigE and 10GigE IP), cellular backhaul and IP video
distribution (though Comcast Media Center subsidiary) [6].
3.2 Inter-domain TrafÔ¨Åc Consolidation
In this subsection, we explore consolidation in inter-
domain traÔ¨Éc demands. We argue the growth of Google,
Comcast, Microsoft and Akamai traÔ¨Éc in Table 2c provides
a bellwether of broader traÔ¨Éc engineering, commercial ex-
pansion and content consolidation trends.
We Ô¨Årst aggregate the 200 fastest growing ASNs described
earlier in this Section into four broad categories using clas-
siÔ¨Åcations from CAIDA [31] and manual inspection. As a
category, ASNs in the content / hosting group grew by 58%,
and consumer networks by 38%, while tier-1/2 both grew
under 28% (i.e., less than the average rate of aggregate inter-
domain growth).
While tier-1 providers still carry signiÔ¨Åcant volumes of
traÔ¨Éc, observed Internet inter-domain traÔ¨Éc patterns in
July 2009 suggest Figure 1b. In this emerging new Inter-
net, the majority of traÔ¨Éc by volume Ô¨Çows directly between
large content providers, datacenter / CDNs and consumer
networks. In many cases, CDNs (e.g., Akamai, LimeLight)
and content providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Facebook)
are directly interconnected with both consumer networks
and tier-1 / tier-2 providers.
Figure 4 shows a graph of the cumulative distribution of
the weighted average percentage of all inter-domain traf-
Ô¨Åc per origin ASN. The vertical axis shows the cumulative
percentage and the horizontal axis provides the number of
unique ASNs in both July 2007 and 2009.
The main interpretation of the graph in Figure 4 is that
as of July 2009, 150 ASNs originate more than 50% of all
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc. The remainder of inter-domain traf-
Ô¨Åc originates across a heavy-tailed distribution of the other
30,000 BGP ASNs. If traÔ¨Éc were evenly distributed across
all ASNs, we would expect the top 150 ASNs to contribute
only 0.15% of inter-domain traÔ¨Éc. By way of comparison,
the top 150 ASNs contributed only 30% of all inter-domain
traÔ¨Éc in July of 2007.
We observe that the Internet ASN traÔ¨Éc distribution in
Figure 4 approximates a power law distribution. While dis-
cussion of power law properties and processes is beyond the
scope of this paper, we note power laws have been observed
(and debated) in Internet AS-level topology [32].
Table 3 shows the top ten origin ASNs as a weighted aver-
age percentage of all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc during July 2009.
As of July 2009, Google‚Äôs origin ASNs contribute a weighted
