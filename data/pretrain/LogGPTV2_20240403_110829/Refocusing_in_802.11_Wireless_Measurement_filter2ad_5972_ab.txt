# Refocusing in 802.11 Wireless Measurement

## 1. Introduction
Amsniffers that capture frames matching a specific predicate will be instructed by the amcontroller to allocate more sampling time to the channels recently carrying that traffic. Amsniffers not capturing traffic from the specified laptop will continue to follow a default sampling policy. If the laptop associates with a different access point using another channel or moves within range of different amsniffers, the reduced time spent on other channels will enable those amsniffers to focus on the laptop. A short cycle time, typically 1-2 seconds, allows each amsniffer to quickly identify and focus on the required traffic patterns. The ability to remotely program the amsniffers with a wide variety of predicates facilitates experimentation.

## 2. Applications of Refocusing
Refocusing has numerous applications in wireless research, security, and network management. Any application requiring more than cursory scanning of wireless traffic may need an increased focus on specific subsets of the traffic, while others may simultaneously require broad baseline sampling.

### 2.1 Localization
If a Wi-Fi device needs to be geographically localized, the refocusing system can capture more frames to and from it, aiding in better localization by capturing more frames from multiple perspectives (amsniffers). This increases the accuracy or reduces latency for estimating the device's location using state-of-the-art methods.

### 2.2 VoIP Quality Measurement
For monitoring the quality of Voice-over-IP calls, a network manager can focus on known VoIP clients' MAC addresses and monitor the relevant channels more closely. Alternatively, the system can focus on channels with observed VoIP activity (by recognizing specific protocols) or through high-level metrics like jitter, per-frame delay, or congestion. For example, a predicate might be "jitter >= x ms." Such high-level predicates are part of our future work.

### 2.3 Security Monitoring
The system can refocus on channels with an excessive number of deauthentication messages or on MAC addresses known to have been recently spoofed. In the future, we can use these techniques to focus on channels where new clients appear, study their packets to determine if they are vulnerable to attack, and refocus sampling to more closely monitor them.

## 3. Experimental Results

### 3.1 Improved Volume of Capture
In our CS department, we deployed 19 Aruba AP70 amsniffers across three floors. Each amsniffer is equipped with a MIPS IDT32434 CPU, 32MB DRAM, two Atheros AR5212 802.11a/b/g NICs, two Ethernet NICs, and one USB port. We installed OpenWRT Linux and Madwifi, along with a copy of amsniffer, on each amsniffer.

We conducted two experiments where a laptop transmitted 10 UDP frames per second to a non-existent MAC address on a randomly selected 802.11b channel, changing channels every 10 seconds. The laptop was carried around a fixed path for 10 minutes.

In the first experiment, the amsniffers used an equal-time sampling strategy. In the second experiment, the amsniffers were refocused to spend more time on channels capturing more frames from the experimental laptop using the predicate "dst == 22:22:22:22:22:22."

Figure 2 shows that the refocusing strategy consistently captured more frames from the mobile laptop compared to the equal-time strategy. Figure 3 indicates that although the refocused strategy captured fewer non-matching frames, it still provided sufficient baseline traffic for other subscribers.

### 3.2 Localization Experiment
Our hypothesis is that refocusing will allow more accurate and faster determination of a wireless client's location. We used the Nearest Neighbor in Signal Space (NNSS) method, which uses observed signal strengths of frames heard by clients from APs. We calibrated the third-floor corridor, measuring signal strength at every amsniffer from a client transmitting 50 frames every five feet. In the second phase, we configured the amsniffers to sample equally on every channel and captured a trace of the client transmitting 10 frames every 10 feet. Finally, we refocused the amsniffers on the client's MAC address and captured a trace at the same locations. With refocusing, localizations were, on average, 1.95 feet more accurate.

## 4. Discussion
Given the increasing number of Wi-Fi channels, efficient mechanisms for sampling network traffic are essential. Our proposed mechanism allows dynamic refocusing of the wireless-measurement infrastructure to capture more desired traffic. Preliminary results show that refocusing successfully captures more frames matching the supplied predicate without significantly degrading the capture of non-matching frames.

However, more complex scenarios may require maintaining more state. For example, our framework currently cannot express the desire to refocus on newly arrived clients or on channels with high jitter. Our next step is to extend the framework to handle such temporal changes.
