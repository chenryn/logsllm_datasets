User: Starting a Perl script with alarm(3600) will make the script abort if it is still running after one hour (3600 seconds).
Assume I want to set an upper bound on the running time of a Python script, what is the easiest way to achieve that?
Assistant: Just for your information: this is much self-descriptive to use multiplication when you set up  timers, for example alarm(24 * 60 * 60) for 24 hours, instead of alarm(86400) for the same period. Hope this will help keep your code clean and easy-maintainable :)
