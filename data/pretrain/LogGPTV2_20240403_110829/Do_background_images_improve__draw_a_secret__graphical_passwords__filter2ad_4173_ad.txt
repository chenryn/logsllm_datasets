The  average  strength  of  all  passwords  in  the  BDAS  group  is 
estimated to be of larger than 70.2 bits. The corresponding figure 
for the DAS group would be less than 60 bits. That is, around a 10 
bit difference.  
Symmetry.  We  found  that  43%  of  secrets  (10/23)  created  with 
BDAS exhibited global symmetry, compared to about 57% (13/23) 
in the DAS group. Symmetry was reduced with BDAS, but not to 
the extent we observed in the first study.  
Centering.  We  found  that  43%  (10/23)  secrets  with  BDAS 
exhibited centering, while 87% (20/23) using DAS exhibited this 
too. To a large extent centering was reduced with BDAS, as the 
background  image  content  gave  the  users  different  options  for 
image placement.  
6.3 Recall – Five Minutes After 
Table  8  summarises  the  results  of  recall  tests  conducted  five 
minutes after a secret was created in each group. In this test, only 
one person in the BDAS group was unable to repeat their secret, 
and the recall success rate is quite close in two groups.

Table 9 compares the complexity of secrets that were successfully 
recalled  in  two  groups.  The  average  stroke  count  of  a  drawing 
created with BDAS was 7.45 as opposed to 5.09 with DAS. The 
standard deviation was also lower with BDAS (2.26 vs. 2.41). A t-
test  gives  t=2.9  p<  0.01,  indicating  that  the  stroke  count  of  the 
successfully recalled  BDAS  secrets  was  significantly larger. The 
length  of  recalled  BDAS  passwords  was  also  larger  on  average 
(21.7  vs.  17.71),  though  not  to  a  statistically  significant  level.  
Furthermore, only 40.9% (9/22) of recalled secrets in the BDAS 
group  had  global  symmetry,  compared  to  56.5%  (13/23)  in  the 
DAS group; 40.9% (9/22) of recalled secrets in the BDAS group 
were centered, compared to 87.0% (20/23) in the DAS group.

In this recall test, the average strength of memorable passwords in 
the  BDAS  group  was  greater  than  that  of  all  passwords  in  the 
same group (stroke count: 7.45 vs. 7.21, password length: 21.7 vs. 
21. 43), but the average strength of memorable passwords in the 
DAS  group  was  weaker  than  that  of  all  passwords  in  the  same 
group  (stroke  count:  5.09  vs.  5.30,  password  length:  17.71  vs. 
18.26).  Therefore,  the  difference  of  the  strength  of  memorable 
passwords in two groups was larger than 10 bits.  
Additionally we examined the number of attempts users needed to 
recall  a  secret  successfully.  The  performance  of  DAS  users  was 
marginally  better  than  BDAS:  18  DAS  users  succeeded  in 
recalling  their  secrets  first  time,  compared  to  16  with  BDAS;  5 
users  in  both  schemes  needed  2  attempts,  and  1  BDAS  user 
required  3  attempts;  no  DAS  user  needed  more  than  2  attempts. 
The  figures  returned  in  this  analysis  are  similar,  so  users 
performed  about  the  same  repeating  more  complex  secrets  on 
average  than  DAS,  implying  that  BDAS  did  not  hinder  user 
performance. 
6.4 Recall – A Week Later 
One week later, participants were asked to recall their own secrets 
created  the  week  before.  Not  all  people  returned,  and  2 
participants were lost in each group. 
We received 42 responses in this test and 2 people (one from each 
group)  were  unable  to  repeat  their  secrets  within  the  3  attempt 
limit.  Table  10  compares  the  successful  recalls  in  each  group  in 
this test, and the recall success rate is the same in two groups.

the  complexity  of  secrets 
Table  11  compares 
that  were 
successfully  recalled  in  two  groups.  The  complexity  of  secrets 
recalled  in  the  BDAS  group  was  again  greater  than  in  the  DAS 
group. A t-test gives a result of t=2.96 p<0.01, indicating that the 
stroke  count  of  passwords  that  were  successfully  recalled  was 
significantly larger. The length of recalled BDAS passwords was 
also larger on average (20.9 vs. 17.45). Furthermore, only 45.5% 
(10/22)  of  recalled  secrets  in  the  BDAS  group  had  global 
symmetry, compared to 59.1% (13/22) in the DAS group; 45.5% 
(10/22)  of  recalled  secrets  in  the  BDAS  group  were  centered, 
compared to 86.4% (19/22) in the DAS group. 
The average strength of memorable passwords with BDAS in this 
recall was larger than 70.2 bits, but the corresponding figure for 
the DAS group would be less than 60 bits. That is still around a 10 
bit difference. Although the average stroke count for memorable 
passwords in DAS group was 5, numerous secrets in this set had a 
stroke count of below 5. On the other hand, the average strength of 
memorable  passwords  in  each  group  in  this  test  was  slightly 
weaker than that in the 5-minute recall. This is reasonable, since 
memory fades as time goes by.  
We  observed  in  the  first  study  that  all  BDAS  users  (including 
those who failed to recall their secrets in the 1-week test) could all 
remember  to  start  from  the  correct  cell.  However,  this  was  not 
observed in the current study.

We  collected  the  number  of  attempts  each  user  needed  to  recall 
their  secret.  Again,  DAS  users  performed  marginally  better, 
repeating  16  secrets  correctly  first-time  compared  with  13  using 
BDAS. 5 BDAS users needed 2 attempts compared with 4 from 
DAS, and only 1 person - a BDAS user - required 3 attempts. The 
same observation as before could be applied here: although secrets 
of  more  complexity  were  encouraged,  BDAS  would  not  hinder 
user performance in authentication. 
6.5 Interpretation of Study 2 Results  
Study  2  has  confirmed  that  BDAS  did  significantly  increase 
password  complexity  by  increasing  stroke  count  and  password 
length,  and  it  also  made  passwords  less  predictable  by  reducing 
global symmetry and centering. It appears that the explanation we 
made  in  the  pilot  study  that  centering  and  incorporating  global 
symmetry are coping techniques employed by DAS users to make 
secrets memorable on an un-memorable grid was also confirmed. 
Furthermore, the BDAS passwords were just as memorable as the 
weaker DAS passwords created. This outcome is important as any 
added gains in terms of complexity are useless without a sufficient 
gain  in  memorability.  Our  two  studies  are  in  fact  consistent  in 
these  results.  Due  to  the  number  of  participants,  we  believe that 
the second study is even more reliable.  
7. FURTHER DISCUSSIONS  
7.1 On Background Image Choices  
An  interesting  point to  note  in terms  of  image choice  from  both 
studies is that the playing card was the most popular followed by 
the plant image, although it was anticipated that the images dense 
with content would be the most popular.  
The feedback we received suggests the popularity of the playing 
card  was  due  to  the  image  being  much  easier  to  digest  than  the 
others. Also participants felt the spades on the card appearing in a 
symmetric fashion made them feel it would be easier to construct 
a secret around them without being distracting.   
The feedback from participants choosing the plant image included 
that the plant divided the picture well and provided a good focal 
point  around  which  to  construct  a  drawing  without  being  too 
distracting.  
In  fact  the  word  ‘distracting’  was  a  recurring  one.  Our  own 
guesses  at  what  makes  a  BDAS  image  distracting  includes  a 
number  of  contrasting  colors  and  few  elements  of  symmetry. 
Future study will determine if these observations hold in general. 
The remaining 3 images show much less of structure but contain 
the  most  color.  This  is  possibly  why  they  were  chosen  so  few 
times.  The  participants  selecting  the  space  and  crowd  images 
commented that they simply liked the image as a whole.  
The  security  implications  of  varying  background  image  choices 
made  by  the  BDAS  users  are  as  follows.  First,  allowing  users  a 
free  choice  of  background  image in the  real  world  might  reduce 
the password space. Second, if both popular and unpopular images 
are available for users to chose, attackers who know the difference 
of these images can make use of this knowledge to their advantage.    
7.2 On Estimating BDAS Password Strength 
In  Sections  5  and  6,  the  strength  of  BDAS  passwords  was 
estimated  using  the  method  designed  for  non-background  grid 
drawings,  i.e.  DAS  secrets.  As  discussed  earlier,  background 
images  in  principle  could  introduce  bias  to  BDAS  passwords, 
reducing  their  security.  Would  this  imply  that  the  observed 
increase in BDAS password complexity may not in fact indicate 
increased password security?  
Our  estimate  of  BDAS  password  strength  did  ignore  possible 
negative  biases  that  could  be  introduced  by  background  images. 
However, what these negative biases are is an open problem, and 
so is the following:  
•  How these biases would aid attackers?  
•  Whether  security  reduction  caused  by  these  biases  can 
be compensated by reduced symmetry and centering? 
At the time of preparing the camera-ready version of the present 
paper,  we  became  aware  of  two  recent  studies  [14,5]  that 
demonstrate  the  effects  of  hotspots  could  cause  serious  security 
downgrade  in  the  PassPoints  scheme.  The  weakness  highlighted 
by  these  studies  is  a  concern,  however  at  present  we  have  little 
knowledge  on  the  implications  of  these  results  in  the  different 
BDAS environment. 
Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to note: 
•  No significant bias that could impact security, other than 
reduced  symmetry  and  centering,  was  observed  in  our 
experiments (though we agree it might not be the case in 
a larger scale study). 
Strength  figures  we  used  for  BDAS  passwords,  for 
convenience, were just the minimum estimates directly 
quoted  from  Table  2  in  the  extended  version  of  [13], 
while off scale estimate was not calculated.  
• 
•  Our  estimate  did  not  consider  either  symmetry  or 
centering  reduced  by  BDAS  at  all.  If  considered,  both 
would increase our password strength figures.  
Another  interesting  question  is  how  a  system  designer  would 
determine and evaluate the possible negative impacts on password 
entropy  imposed  by  a  given  background.  In  fact,  evaluating  the 
effect  of  different  types  of  images  on  BDAS  passwords  is  our 
future work. For example, we plan to identify hot spots in BDAS 
background images with eye tracking, and examine the correlation 
between  those  hotspots  and  BDAS  passwords  created  by  users. 
Eventually we will establish what effects these hotspots have on 
the  system,  then  using  this  knowledge  to  propose  guidelines  for 
background image choices for BDAS. 
7.3 Artistic Skills 
The  secrets  created  in  each  group  very  much  depended  on  the 
artistic ability of the participant. On a number of occasions during 
the experiment, participants in both studies expressed concern at 
their  lack  of  artistic  skills  and  so  their  secrets  tended  to  involve 
writing  characters  in  grid  squares  in  a  pattern  they  could 
remember. Figure 8 shows three secrets produced by subjects who 
professed to be bad artists. The first drawing was from Study 1, 
and resulted in a weak secret featuring a high number of dots and 
with  a  relatively  low  password  length.  The  remaining  two  were 
from Study 2.  
Figure 8. Secrets created by participants claiming to be bad 
artists  
Of  the  participants  who  attempted  to  draw  something,  the  most 
popular  creations  in  the  first  experiment  were  simple,  everyday 
objects such as cars, cups, and in particular houses, all of which 
accounted  for  38%  of  the  secrets  created.  Experiment  2  had  a
