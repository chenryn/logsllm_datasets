variables kis that exist within the quadratic equation using
Algorithm 1 where we choose 300 (i.e. κ = 300) samples of
vector x independently and uniformly at random (cf. Lem-
ma 1 and Algorithm 1 for more detail). Secondly, we derive
all terms of degree 0 ( constant terms), degree 1 and degree
2 within the quadratic equation using Algorithm 2.
After searching for nonlinear superpoly equations of de-
gree 2, we have been able to (cid:12)nd 62 simple quadratic equa-
tions, which combined with 32 independent linear equation-
s (among the previously obtained set of linear equations),
can provide a unique solution for all the 64 secret key vari-
ables. The system of equations can then be easily solved by
linearizing the system and solving it using the well-known
Gaussian elimination method. Table 3 and Table 4, which
are provided in the Appendix, show the sets of equations
which can provide the unique solution for the 64 secret key
variables, respectively, for PRESENT-80 and PRESENT-
128.
Having this set of equations, the preprocessing phase is
completed and the attacker during the online phase should
(cid:12)nd the value of the right-hand side of each equation by
summing the master polynomials (corresponding the second
and third bits of the Haming weight) over each cube which
is listed in Table 3 and Table 4. Since we have 2 cubes of size
2, 62 cubes of size 4 and 30 cubes of size 8, then we require
2 (cid:2) 22 + 62 (cid:2) 24 + 30 (cid:2) 28 (cid:25) 213 chosen plaintexts to (cid:12)nd
the value of right-hand side of all 94 equations. Considering
that we have been able to (cid:12)nd a unique solution for all the
64 secret key variables, the total time complexity to (cid:12)nd the
correct 80-bit key and 128-bit key reduces to 216 and 264
respectively.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We showed an extension to the cube attack to e(cid:14)ciently
derive low degree nonlinear superpoly equations to help im-
prove the success level in a key recovery attack, especially in
the cases that only limited number of maxterms can be found
by the original cube attack. We also investigated the securi-
ty of the PRESENT block cipher against side channel cube
attack, assuming the Hamming weight leakage model and
applying our extended cube attack. Our attack improves up-
on the previous attack of Yang et al. on PRESENT-80, from
both leakage model and complexity viewpoints. Improving
the attack against PRESENT-128, e.g. by combining more
leakage information from several other rounds of the cipher,
and investigating the applicability of the proposed extend-
ed cube attack to other ciphers, especially in the tradition-
al cryptanalytical framework (without side channel leakage
assumptions), are proposed as interesting works for future
research.
