**Title: Rough and Ready: Frameworks for Measuring Persistent Engagement and Deterrence in U.S. Cyber Policy**

The United States is currently undergoing a significant policy shift, focusing on forward defense and deterrence to "intercept and halt" cyber operations by adversaries. Proponents of this approach argue that these measures will substantially reduce attacks against the U.S., while critics express concern that such actions may provoke increased adversary activity. Currently, there is no standardized methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of these policies.

In this talk, we will present recent research aimed at introducing transparent frameworks to better assess whether the new U.S. policy and actions are effectively suppressing or inadvertently encouraging cyber attacks. These frameworks will provide a structured and rigorous approach to measuring the impact of persistent engagement and deterrence strategies, enabling more informed and evidence-based decision-making.
