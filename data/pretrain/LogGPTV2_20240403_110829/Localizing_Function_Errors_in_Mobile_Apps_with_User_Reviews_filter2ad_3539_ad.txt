As
shown in Table IV, ReviewSolver may miss
some mappings. One reason is that the classes in the apk
ﬁle published on Google Play may not be in consistent
with the classes mentioned in bug report. For example,

The former uses the latter to get

cannot recognize the latter. To reduce the missed mappings
generated by the function call relationship, we can use the
method call graph to ﬁnd more methods related to the error.
For example, if ReviewSolver ﬁnd one method related to
the function error described in the review, all other methods
called by the method are also related to this function error.

Answer to RQ2: The experimental result shows that:
Given the same set of
related reviews,
ReviewSolver can correctly resolve more reviews than
ChangeAdvisor.
D. Resolving Function Error related Reviews
function error
As shown in Table V, ReviewSolver discovers 4,912
function error related reviews, which account for 38.6% (i.e.,
4,912/12,735) negative reviews. 45.3% (i.e., 2,226/4,912) of
these function error related reviews can be mapped to code
by ReviewSolver. This number is much larger than that of
ChangeAdvisor, which can only map 365 of them to code
(i.e., 7.4%, 365/4,912).

1) Distribution of Context Information Used for Locating
Errors: Since ReviewSolver uses various context infor-
mation to map review to code, for each context information,
we count the number of function error reviews that can be
426
located by using it for the sake of measuring the effectiveness
of different context information. As shown in Table VI, nearly
half of function errors can be resolved by using app speciﬁc
task related information. This result is in consistent with that
of manual check (i.e., Table I shows that “(1) App Speciﬁc
Task” is the most frequent kind of context information).

Table VI lists the number of function error reviews that
can be mapped to code by ReviewSolver through different
context information. It shows that the context information of
“App Speciﬁc Task” can be used to resolved most reviews
(i.e., 47.1%). Note that the distribution shown in Table VI may
not be the same as that in Table I due to two reasons. First,
when calculating the values in Table VI, we only consider the
reviews that contain context information whereas for Table I
the reviews that do not contain any context information are
grouped to “(8) Other”. Such reviews account for around
40% function error related reviews. Second, when calculating
the values in Table VI, we ﬁnd that some reviews contain
multiple kinds of context information. For example, for the
error reviews describing the behaviors of updating apps, 36.7%
(293/799) of them also contain other context information (e.g.,
API/URI/intent). Such reviews will be counted multiple times
under different categories of context information. For Table I,
we only consider the major context information (i.e., the most
important information that can help use locate the error). For
example, for the review “After updating the app, I cannot
connect server”, we regard “connect server” as the major
context information since we can use it to locate the error
precisely.
2) Correctness of the Mappings Form Function Error Re-
views to Code: To check the precision of the mapping from
reviews to code identiﬁed by ReviewSolver, we manually
check 50 mappings for each app. The result is shown in the
third and fourth columns of Table VII, and we can see that
ReviewSolver can achieve 73.1% precision.
Cause of false mappings. The major cause of the false
mappings is that some phrases extracted from review are not
related to function errors, but we still use them to locate errors.
For example, consider the review “I was able to add cards to
the decks, but now I’m unable to even view the cards”. As user
is able to “add cards”, the error is not related to this behavior.
ReviewSolver still map this phrase to classes since we can
ﬁnd the method names that contain similar verb phrases. The
error described in this review is “view the cards”, which is
a function implemented by the developer. ReviewSolver
cannot locate it since we cannot ﬁnd any class/method/ﬁeld
names that contain similar verb phrases. To remove such false
mappings, we need to conduct sentiment analysis on the sub-

We further select 10 apps that contain commit messages
in Githu, and for each app we check 50 function error
related reviews and the corresponding classes suggested by
ReviewSolver. For each review, we count the number of
classes that were modiﬁed within three months. The result is
shown in Table VIII. We can ﬁnd that 38.6% (832/2,153) of
the classes found by ReviewSolver have been modiﬁed
within three months.
