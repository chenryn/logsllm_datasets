User: This would be quite a general question though,
what I want to know is:
when scheduling a python script(ex. everyday 1:00 PM), I wonder if we have to let the script(or editor such as spyder) always 'open'. This means, do I have to let python always running? I have avoided to use scheduler library because people say that the python script is not killed, pending and waiting for the next task.
What I have been doing as far was just using Windows Scheduler to run my scripts(crawlers) automatically everyday(people say this is called the 'batch process'..). But now I have to do these jobs on the server side, not in my local any more.
Therefore, how can I run my python scripts just the same as the Windows Scheduler, with using the python scheduler library?
Assistant: You can use cron in linux. I also use cron to run my python script on my shared hosting server. And if you need to install python modules on your server maybe you also need to create a virtual environment using virtualenv. From my experience, if your script has clean exit than your python script will be killed or terminated properly, so you dont have to worry about python script not being killed and consuming your server resources :D
