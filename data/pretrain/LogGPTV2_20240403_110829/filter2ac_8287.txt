**Recommendations:**

1. **Application Permissions:**
   - Users should be highly cautious when granting phone call-based permissions to applications. It is essential to thoroughly review and understand the implications of these permissions before allowing them.

2. **Default Call Handler:**
   - Users should avoid changing their default call handler to applications that they do not recognize or trust. This precaution helps to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential security threats.

By following these guidelines, users can better protect themselves from potential security risks associated with phone call-based permissions and default call handlers.
