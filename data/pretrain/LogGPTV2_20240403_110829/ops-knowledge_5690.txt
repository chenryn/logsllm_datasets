User: How to implement remote login and file transfer in Linux system? Please describe both approaches and their pros and cons.
Assistant: Method 1: Use the SSH protocol to realize remote login and file transfer 1. Use the ssh command for remote login: you can use the ssh command on the local terminal, enter the IP address and port number of the remote server (the default is 22), enter the user name and password, You can log in to the target host remotely. For example: ssh username@ip_address -p port_number 2. Use the scp command for file transfer: you can use the scp command to upload local files to the remote server, or download remote files to the local. For example: Upload the local test.txt file to the remote host: scp test.txt username@ip_address:/remote/directory Download the remote file remote_file.txt to the local: scp username@ip_address:/remote/directory/remote_file.txt /local /directory Advantages: The SSH protocol uses encryption to transmit data, which can ensure data security; the SSH protocol is a command line tool that comes with the Linux system, and no third-party software needs to be installed. Cons: The SSH protocol is slower when transferring large files. Method 2: Use FTP protocol to realize remote login and file transfer 1. Install FTP service: Install FTP service on the target host, such as vsftpd or proftpd. 2. Use the ftp command to log in remotely: You can use the ftp command on the local terminal, enter the IP address and port number of the remote server (the default is 21), and enter the user name and password to remotely log in to the target host. For example: ftp username@ip_address -p port_number 3. Use ftp command for file transfer: You can use ftp command for file upload and download. For example: Upload the local test.txt file to the remote host: put test.txt Download the remote file remote_file.txt to the local: get remote_file.txt Advantages: The FTP protocol supports the transfer of large files at a faster speed. Disadvantages: The FTP protocol does not use encryption when transmitting data, and there is a risk of data leakage; FTP service needs to be installed, which increases the maintenance cost of the system.
