Hello,

I recently built JAX from source, but encountered an error when trying to import it. The error message is as follows:

```python
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/jaxlib/cusolver.py in 
     24   from jaxlib import cublas_kernels
     25   for _name, _value in cublas_kernels.registrations().items():
---> 26     xla_client.register_custom_call_target(_name, _value, platform="CUDA")
     27 except ImportError:
     28   pass

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/jaxlib/xla_client.py in register_custom_call_target(name, fn, platform)
    432     platform: the target platform.
    433   """
--> 434   _xla.register_custom_call_target(name, fn, xla_platform_names[platform])
    435 
    436 

KeyError: 'CUDA'
```

Upon reviewing the source code, it appears that lines 26 and 34 in `jaxlib/cusolver.py` should be modified to:

```python
xla_client.register_custom_call_target(_name, _value, platform="gpu")
```

to align with the `xla_platform_names` dictionary in `xla_client.py`. After making this change, I encountered another error:

```python
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/jaxlib/cuda_prng.py", line 27, in 
    xla_client.register_custom_call_target(_name, _value, platform="CUDA")

File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/jaxlib/xla_client.py", line 434, in register_custom_call_target
    _xla.register_custom_call_target(name, fn, xla_platform_names[platform])

KeyError: 'CUDA'
```

It seems that line 434 in `jaxlib/xla_client.py` should also be updated to:

```python
xla_client.register_custom_call_target(_name, _value, platform="gpu")
```

Could you please confirm if my understanding and proposed changes are correct, or if there is something else I might have missed?

Thank you.
