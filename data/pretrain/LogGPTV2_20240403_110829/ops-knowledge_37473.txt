User: I wrote a program in IDLE to tokenize text files and it starts to tokeniza 349 text files! How can I stop it? How can I stop a running Python program?
Assistant: Ctrl+Z should do it, if you're caught in the python shell. Keep in mind that instances of the script could continue running in background, so under linux you have to kill the corresponding process.
