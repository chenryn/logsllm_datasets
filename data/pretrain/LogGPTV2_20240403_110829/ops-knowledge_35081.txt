**User:** I apologize if this is a very basic question, but when I open the Python IDLE editor, the shell opens first, and then I have to manually open the editor from the shell. Is there a way to have both the shell and the editor automatically resize to a specific size upon opening? Could I use a batch file for this?

**Assistant:** 

To configure the initial window size for both the shell and the editor in Python IDLE, you can follow these steps:

1. Open IDLE.
2. Go to `Options` in the menu bar.
3. Select `Configure IDLE`.
4. Navigate to the `General` tab.
5. In the `Initial Window Size` section, you can set the desired width and height for the windows.

This will ensure that every time you open IDLE, both the shell and the editor will automatically resize to the specified dimensions.

Using a batch file to automate this process is not directly supported by IDLE, as the configuration is handled internally by the application. However, following the steps above should achieve the desired result without the need for additional scripts.

If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask!
