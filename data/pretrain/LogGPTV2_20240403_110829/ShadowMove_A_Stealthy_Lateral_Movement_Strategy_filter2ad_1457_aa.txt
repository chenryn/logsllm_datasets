## Abstract
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks employ various strategies and techniques to move laterally within an enterprise environment. However, these existing methods often have limitations, such as requiring elevated permissions, creating new connections, performing additional authentications, or needing process injections. These characteristics have led to the development of numerous host and network-based solutions to prevent or detect such lateral movement attempts.

In this paper, we introduce a novel stealthy lateral movement strategy called **ShadowMove**. This method leverages only established connections between systems in an enterprise network, thereby avoiding the need for elevated privileges, new connections, extra authentications, or process injections. This makes ShadowMove highly evasive against state-of-the-art detection mechanisms.

ShadowMove is enabled by a novel socket duplication technique that allows a malicious process to silently abuse TCP connections established by benign processes. We have designed and implemented ShadowMove for both Windows and Linux operating systems. To validate its feasibility, we developed several prototypes that successfully hijack three types of enterprise protocols—FTP, Microsoft SQL, and Windows Remote Management (WinRM)—to perform lateral movement actions such as copying malware to the next target machine and launching it.

We confirmed that our prototypes are undetectable by existing host and network-based solutions, including five top-tier antivirus products (McAfee, Norton, Webroot, Bitdefender, and Windows Defender), four Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) (Snort, OSSEC, Osquery, and Wazuh), and two Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems (CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent and Cisco AMP).

## 1. Introduction
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, well-planned, and multi-step cyber attacks targeting high-profile entities such as government agencies or large enterprises. These attacks are carried out by well-resourced and knowledgeable attackers, costing companies and government agencies billions of dollars annually in financial losses.

APT attackers typically use spearphishing or watering hole attacks to gain a foothold within target networks. Once inside, they cautiously use compromised systems as stepping stones to reach other systems until they gain access to critical assets, such as file servers containing confidential documents. This incremental movement toward critical systems is known as lateral movement.

Lateral movement can be achieved through various means:
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in network services like SMB or RDP.
- Harvesting and reusing user credentials from compromised systems.
- Hijacking legitimate client connections to reuse them for lateral movement.

However, these methods are increasingly difficult to execute without detection due to advancements in defense mechanisms. For example, credential harvesting requires new network connections, which can be detected by network-level defenses. Hijacking attacks, while more stealthy, are application-specific and require process injection, making them hard to implement and prone to detection.

In this paper, we present **ShadowMove**, a novel lateral movement strategy that enables APT attackers to move stealthily within enterprise networks without being detected by existing host and network-level defenses. ShadowMove avoids exploiting remote service vulnerabilities and instead passively observes communication dynamics to construct a model of normal behaviors. It then reuses established connections to perform lateral movements, injecting commands into the command streams of protocols like WinRM and FTP.

## 2. ShadowMove Approach
The core idea of ShadowMove is to reuse established and legitimate connections for lateral movement. The process involves three main steps:
1. Silently duplicating a socket used by a legitimate client application to communicate with a server.
2. Using the duplicated socket to inject packets into the existing TCP session.
3. The server processes the injected packets, inadvertently executing the attacker's commands.

By reusing established connections, ShadowMove ensures that intrusion detection systems, which raise alarms for unexpected connections, cannot detect its operation. Additionally, it bypasses the authentication phase required for new connections.

### 2.1 Fundamental Weaknesses Exploited by ShadowMove
Two fundamental weaknesses in the computing environment enable ShadowMove attacks:
1. **Conflicting Requirements in Operating Systems**: Modern operating systems must balance process isolation and resource sharing. While necessary, these requirements can be exploited if not properly controlled.
2. **Lack of Message Origin Integrity Checks**: Many application protocols lack proper mechanisms to verify the origin of messages, making them susceptible to message injection attacks.

### 2.2 Threat Model
We assume that attackers have gained a foothold on a victim system with normal user privileges and aim to move laterally towards critical assets. The victim process whose TCP connection is hijacked is unaware of the malware process.

### Demonstration Scenario
Consider an Employee Self-service Application in a company. This multi-tier enterprise application includes:
- Employee desktop computers running web clients, with some IT personnel having FTP tools installed.
- An application server running various applications.
- A database server storing sensitive employee information.

In this scenario, attackers land on an IT personnel's desktop via spearphishing and aim to access the database server. They need to move from the desktop to the application server and then to the database server.

## 3. Implementation
### 3.1 Connection Detector
The Connection Detector module detects newly-established TCP connections that can be exploited for lateral movement. It requests the Socket Duplicator to duplicate the corresponding sockets and also monitors the teardown of TCP connections, notifying the Network View Manager.

### 3.4 Socket Duplicator
The Socket Duplicator duplicates sockets owned by target processes and passes them to the attacker's process. This allows the attacker to inject commands into the existing TCP sessions without creating new connections or requiring additional authentication.

## 4. Contributions
- **Novel Lateral Movement Strategy**: ShadowMove is completely undetectable by existing network and host-based defensive solutions, including IDSes, Antivirus, and EDR systems.
- **Socket Duplication Technique**: A novel technique that enables attackers to reuse connections established by other processes.
- **Prototype System**: We built a prototype on Windows 10 that successfully hijacks FTP, TDS (used by Microsoft SQL Server), and WinRM connections. This prototype demonstrates all features of ShadowMove, requiring no elevated privilege, no new connection, no extra authentication, and no process injection.
- **Experimental Validation**: Our prototypes evade detection by five top-notch antivirus products, four IDSes, and two EDR systems, including CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent, known for detecting lateral movements.

## 5. Conclusion
Our study highlights the need to revisit the security of enterprise protocols in terms of their susceptibility to hijacking attacks. ShadowMove represents a significant advancement in stealthy lateral movement, underscoring the importance of continuous improvement in cybersecurity measures.
