User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Oracle RMAN full backup due to gaps in ARCHIVE LOGs I've recently recovered a Data Guard configuration.  Simple setup that syncs from primary to standby using Data Guard.

Because it's been on-line for a sustained period, some logs are missing and I need to do a full export.

From what I understand, a full export using RMAN can be accomplished on a running primary as long as the archive logs are taken in the back up.

Is this correct? are there any caveats I should be aware of?  

TIA

Assistant: You can use the RMAN command: RECOVER FROM SERVICE
