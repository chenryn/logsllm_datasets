ABSTRACT
The monitoring of packets destined for routeable, yet un-
used, Internet addresses has proved to be a useful technique
for measuring a variety of speciﬁc Internet phenomenon (e.g.,
worms, DDoS). In 2004, Pang et al. stepped beyond these
targeted uses and provided one of the ﬁrst generic character-
izations of this non-productive traﬃc, demonstrating both
its signiﬁcant size and diversity. However, the six years that
followed this study have seen tremendous changes in both
the types of malicious activity on the Internet and the quan-
tity and quality of unused address space. In this paper, we
revisit the state of Internet ”background radiation” through
the lens of two unique data-sets: a ﬁve-year collection from
a single unused /8 network block, and week-long collections
from three recently allocated /8 network blocks. Through
the longitudinal study of the long-lived block, comparisons
between blocks, and extensive case studies of traﬃc in these
blocks, we characterize the current state of background radi-
ation speciﬁcally highlighting those features that remain in-
variant from previous measurements and those which exhibit
signiﬁcant diﬀerences. Of particular interest in this work is
the exploration of address space pollution, in which signif-
icant non uniform behavior is observed. However, unlike
previous observations of diﬀerences between unused blocks,
we show that increasingly these diﬀerences are the result
of environmental factors (e.g., misconﬁguration, location),
rather than algorithmic factors. Where feasible, we oﬀer
suggestions for clean up of these polluted blocks and iden-
tify those blocks whose allocations should be withheld.

INTRODUCTION
The monitoring of allocated, globally routeable, but un-
used Internet address blocks has been widely used by the
security, operations, and research communities to study a
wide range of interesting Internet phenomenon. As there
are no active hosts in these unused blocks, packets destined
to these IP addresses must be the result of worm propa-
gation[1, 2, 3], DDoS attacks[4], misconﬁguration, or other
unsolicited activity. Systems that monitor unused address
spaces have a variety of names, including darknets [5], net-
work telescopes [6], blackhole monitors [7], network sinks[8],
and network motion sensors [9].
While this monitoring technique had seen heavy use in
the measurement of speciﬁc phenomena, it wasn’t until 2004
when Pang et. al [10] published their seminal paper “Char-
acteristics of Internet Background Radiation” that a detailed
characterization of this incessant non-productive traﬃc was
available. Through passive measurement and active elicita-
tion of connection payloads over several large unused blocks,
the authors characterized the behavior of sources and the
activities prevalent in Internet background radiation. Most
notable in their analysis was the ubiquity of Internet back-
ground radiation, its scale, its rich variegation in targeted
services, and the extreme dynamism in many aspects of the
observed traﬃc.
The six years since this landmark paper have seen sig-
niﬁcant changes both in the size, shape, and traﬃc carried
by the Internet as well as the methods and motivations of
malicious traﬃc that makes up Internet background radia-
tion. While both scanning as a reconnaissance activity and
62as a propagation method are both alive and well, the emer-
gence and growth of botnets [11, 12] have changed the threat
landscape signiﬁcantly for most operators. This view of com-
promised hosts as a resource worth protecting highlights a
tension in botnet design between the degree of detection as
evidenced by how noisy malicious behaviors are, and the de-
sire to maintain the useful resource and avoid detection. As
with any design tradeoﬀ, there are malicious botnets that
continue to be noisy in how they use and acquire hosts (e.g.,
Conﬁcker), nevertheless, the last six years has seen a marked
change in how malicious code behaves [13].
Additionally, today’s Internet continues to witness tremen-
dous year over year growth, fueled in large part by demand
for video [14]. The role of new content delivery mechanisms
have changed how traﬃc ﬂows and user demands continue
to change the applications of interest. These changes im-
pact the behaviors observed in background radiation as new
services become more desirable to discover and new network
services oﬀer new ways to misconﬁgure themselves.
Our study is primarily motivated by the dramatic shifts in
attack behaviors and the Internet as as whole since the origi-
nal 2004 Internet background radiation study [10], Addition-
ally, as IPv4 address exhaustion nears
[15] and dirty net-
work blocks can no longer be returned for newer allocations,
there is an increasing need to both identify and quantify ad-
dress pollution to determine the quality of a network address
block and to determine the utility of any cleanup eﬀort. The
purpose of this paper is to revisit Internet background radi-
ation in order to determine any evolution in the nature of
this traﬃc and to explore any new features that might have
emerged. To provide as broad and detailed a characteri-
zation as possible, we draw on two unique sources of data
for our analysis. First, we examine ﬁve week-long datasets
taken from the same routed /8 unused address block, rep-
resenting the ﬁrst week in February over the last ﬁve years.
Second, we examine three week-long datasets built by an-
nouncing and capturing traﬃc to three separate /8 networks
recently allocated to APNIC and ARIN from IANA. These
three datasets are compared with each other, as well as with
three matching week-long collections from the /8 used in the
longitudinal study.
To summarize, the value of our work is threefold:
• Revisiting Internet Background Radiation In this
paper we present the ﬁrst thorough study of Internet
background radiation since 2004. We study and char-
acterize this traﬃc in an attempt to answer two speciﬁc
questions:
– Temporal Analysis of Internet Background Radi-
ation The ﬁrst question is an attempt to under-
stand how this traﬃc has evolved over a 5 year
time-period.
– Spatial Analysis of Internet Background Radia-
tion The second question attempts to answer the
question of how this traﬃc might vary based on
the speciﬁc darknet address block under observa-
tion.
• A study of Internet Address Pollution Our spa-
tial analysis of background radiation shows signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between large blocks of unused address space.
We argue these diﬀerences are distinct from previously
reported diversity measurements as they are the result
of signiﬁcant volumes of non-uniform environmental
factors—a class of behaviors we collectively label as
address space pollution.
• Availability of these Traces. We will make all
11 datasets, nearly 10 TB of compressed PCAP data,
available through the Protected Repository for the De-
fense of Infrastructure Against Cyber Threats (PRE-
DICT) [16] dataset archive in an eﬀort to further ex-
pand our knowledge of these interesting phenomena
and encourage additional exploration.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows; in Section 2
we describe some directly related work; Section 3 provides an
overview of our data collection methodology and describes
our datasets; Section 4 we revisit Internet background ra-
diation, providing both temporal and spatial studies of this
traﬃc; Section 5 outlines our study of address pollution; Sec-
tion 6 summarizes our results and oﬀers some conclusions
and future work.
2. RELATED WORK
Directly related work in this area can generally be cate-
gorized into two related areas. The ﬁrst area is concerned
with the design, operation and scalability of monitoring In-
ternet background radiation, while the second focuses on the
analysis of the data collected via these systems.
There have been several attempts at building Internet
background radiation monitoring systems; here we describe
the three most popular systems. In [6] the authors discuss
perhaps the most popular and visible monitor at CAIDA.
They describe how the size of the monitored address space
can inﬂuence its ability to detect events. They also present
several alternative models for building distributed network
monitors. Data from this monitor has been made available
to the broad network research community which has served
to increase its visibility. The iSink monitor at the University
of Wisconsin was ﬁrst published in [8], where the authors de-
scribe their experience in building this system as well as us-
ing it for both active and passive monitoring for detection of
possible network abuse activity. One of the chief character-
istics of the system was its ability to ﬁlter the traﬃc as well
as incorporate application level responders. The Internet
Motion Sensor (IMS) system at the University of Michigan
has been described in [9]. The IMS system was perhaps the
most distributed and extensive system of the three we have
described here. A main ﬁnding of this work was the value in
a distributed monitoring system, as diﬀerent blocks in diﬀer-
ent networks reported signiﬁcantly diﬀerent behaviors. The
spatial analysis in our study re-conﬁrms these diﬀerences,
both in space and time, but highlights a growing trend to-
ward pollution as the cause of these diﬀerences.
A wide variety of work based on improving these tech-
niques and systems has followed. A non-exhaustive list of
examples includes: practical techniques for deploying these
sensors [5], how to build scalable ﬁlters in distributed dark-
nets [17], where to place distributed sensors [7], how to
conﬁgure services in these sensors [18], the security and
anonymity of these sensor blocks [19], and the eﬀectiveness
of distributed sensors in various domains such as worm de-
tection [20]. One relevant body of work is that of Cooke
et. al [21] in which we examined observed non uniformity
across monitors and showed that this non uniformity was
the result of algorithmic factors in worm propagation and
