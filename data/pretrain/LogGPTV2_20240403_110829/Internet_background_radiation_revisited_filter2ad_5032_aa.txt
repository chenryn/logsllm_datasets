## Abstract
Monitoring packets destined for routable but unused Internet addresses has proven to be a valuable technique for measuring various Internet phenomena, such as worms and DDoS attacks. In 2004, Pang et al. provided one of the first comprehensive characterizations of this non-productive traffic, demonstrating its significant size and diversity. However, the six years since this study have seen substantial changes in both the types of malicious activity and the quantity and quality of unused address space. This paper revisits the state of Internet "background radiation" using two unique datasets: a five-year collection from a single unused /8 network block and week-long collections from three recently allocated /8 network blocks. Through longitudinal studies, comparisons between blocks, and extensive case studies, we characterize the current state of background radiation, highlighting features that remain invariant and those that show significant differences. Of particular interest is the exploration of address space pollution, where we observe significant non-uniform behavior. Unlike previous observations, we find that these differences are increasingly due to environmental factors rather than algorithmic ones. Where feasible, we offer suggestions for cleaning up polluted blocks and identify blocks whose allocations should be withheld.

## Introduction
The monitoring of allocated, globally routable, but unused Internet address blocks has been widely used by the security, operations, and research communities to study a wide range of Internet phenomena. Since there are no active hosts in these unused blocks, packets destined for these IP addresses must be the result of worm propagation, DDoS attacks, misconfiguration, or other unsolicited activities. Systems that monitor unused address spaces have various names, including darknets, network telescopes, blackhole monitors, network sinks, and network motion sensors.

While this monitoring technique had been heavily used for specific phenomena, it wasn't until 2004 when Pang et al. published their seminal paper, "Characteristics of Internet Background Radiation," that a detailed characterization of this incessant non-productive traffic was available. Through passive measurement and active elicitation of connection payloads over several large unused blocks, the authors characterized the behavior of sources and the activities prevalent in Internet background radiation. Notably, they highlighted the ubiquity, scale, and rich variegation in targeted services, as well as the extreme dynamism in many aspects of the observed traffic.

The six years since this landmark paper have seen significant changes in the size, shape, and traffic carried by the Internet, as well as the methods and motivations of malicious traffic. While scanning as a reconnaissance activity and as a propagation method are still prevalent, the emergence and growth of botnets have significantly changed the threat landscape for most operators. The view of compromised hosts as a resource worth protecting highlights a tension in botnet design between the degree of detection and the desire to maintain the useful resource and avoid detection. Despite this, some botnets continue to be noisy (e.g., Conficker), but the last six years have seen a marked change in how malicious code behaves.

Additionally, the Internet continues to witness tremendous year-over-year growth, driven largely by demand for video. New content delivery mechanisms have changed how traffic flows, and user demands continue to evolve, impacting the behaviors observed in background radiation as new services become more desirable to discover and new network services offer new ways to misconfigure themselves.

Our study is primarily motivated by the dramatic shifts in attack behaviors and the overall evolution of the Internet since the original 2004 study. As IPv4 address exhaustion nears, and dirty network blocks can no longer be returned for newer allocations, there is an increasing need to identify and quantify address pollution to determine the quality of a network address block and the utility of any cleanup effort. The purpose of this paper is to revisit Internet background radiation to determine any evolution in the nature of this traffic and to explore any new features that might have emerged. To provide a broad and detailed characterization, we draw on two unique sources of data for our analysis. First, we examine five week-long datasets taken from the same routed /8 unused address block, representing the first week in February over the last five years. Second, we examine three week-long datasets built by announcing and capturing traffic to three separate /8 networks recently allocated to APNIC and ARIN from IANA. These three datasets are compared with each other and with three matching week-long collections from the /8 used in the longitudinal study.

To summarize, the value of our work is threefold:
- **Revisiting Internet Background Radiation**: We present the first thorough study of Internet background radiation since 2004, studying and characterizing this traffic to answer two specific questions:
  - **Temporal Analysis**: Understanding how this traffic has evolved over a 5-year period.
  - **Spatial Analysis**: Examining how this traffic varies based on the specific darknet address block under observation.
- **A Study of Internet Address Pollution**: Our spatial analysis shows significant differences between large blocks of unused address space. We argue these differences are distinct from previously reported diversity measurements, as they are the result of significant volumes of non-uniform environmental factorsâ€”a class of behaviors we collectively label as address space pollution.
- **Availability of Traces**: We will make all 11 datasets, nearly 10 TB of compressed PCAP data, available through the Protected Repository for the Defense of Infrastructure Against Cyber Threats (PREDICT) dataset archive to further expand our knowledge of these phenomena and encourage additional exploration.

## Related Work
Directly related work in this area can generally be categorized into two areas: the design, operation, and scalability of monitoring Internet background radiation, and the analysis of the data collected via these systems.

Several attempts have been made to build Internet background radiation monitoring systems. Here, we describe the three most popular systems:
- **CAIDA Monitor**: The most popular and visible monitor at CAIDA, which discusses the influence of the monitored address space size on event detection and presents alternative models for building distributed network monitors. Data from this monitor has been made available to the broad network research community, increasing its visibility.
- **iSink Monitor**: Developed at the University of Wisconsin, this system describes the experience in building and using the system for both active and passive monitoring for the detection of possible network abuse activity. A key characteristic is its ability to filter traffic and incorporate application-level responders.
- **Internet Motion Sensor (IMS)**: Developed at the University of Michigan, this system is perhaps the most distributed and extensive. It highlights the value of a distributed monitoring system, as different blocks in different networks report significantly different behaviors. Our spatial analysis reconfirms these differences, both in space and time, but highlights a growing trend toward pollution as the cause of these differences.

A wide variety of work has followed, focusing on improving these techniques and systems. Examples include practical deployment techniques, scalable filters in distributed darknets, placement of distributed sensors, configuration of services in these sensors, security and anonymity of sensor blocks, and the effectiveness of distributed sensors in various domains such as worm detection. One relevant body of work by Cooke et al. examined observed non-uniformity across monitors and showed that this non-uniformity was the result of algorithmic factors in worm propagation and other malicious activities.

## Data Collection Methodology and Datasets
We use two unique sources of data for our analysis:
- **Longitudinal Dataset**: Five week-long datasets taken from the same routed /8 unused address block, representing the first week in February over the last five years.
- **Recent Allocations Dataset**: Three week-long datasets built by announcing and capturing traffic to three separate /8 networks recently allocated to APNIC and ARIN from IANA. These three datasets are compared with each other and with three matching week-long collections from the /8 used in the longitudinal study.
