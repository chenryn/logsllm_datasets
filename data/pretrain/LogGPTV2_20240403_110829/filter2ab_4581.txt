### Title: Black Hat US-20: Deep Dive into Apple IO80211FamilyV2

Starting with macOS Catalina Beta, Apple refactored the architecture of the 802.11 Wi-Fi client drivers and renamed the new generation design to IO80211FamilyV2. Compared to the original IO80211Family (V1), this updated version integrates modules such as Version 2 and AppleBCMWLANCore, which consolidate the former AirPortBrcm series drivers. Additionally, it introduces expanded features like Sidecar and Skywalk, providing enhanced support and protection for communication and data sharing between devices.

While these advancements bring significant improvements, they also introduce new vulnerabilities and potential risks. This research will delve into each of the affected Wi-Fi kernel components and explore new attack surfaces. We will also share over a dozen zero-day vulnerabilities, which can be categorized into at least four types based on the architectural level:

1. **Vulnerabilities Affecting Only V1**: These are issues that have been fixed in V2, but the improvements have not been synchronized across all system platforms. Consequently, these vulnerabilities can still be exploited in older versions of macOS, such as High Sierra and Mojave.

2. **Vulnerabilities Affecting Only V2**: These security flaws were inadvertently introduced by developers during the porting of existing V1 functions to Catalina.

3. **Vulnerabilities Affecting Both V1 and V2**: These are common issues that persist in both versions of the Wi-Fi subsystem.

4. **Vulnerabilities in New Features of V2**: Many of these new features have not undergone rigorous auditing and testing, making them particularly susceptible to exploitation.

Through these detailed case studies, this presentation aims to provide a deeper understanding of the design and security challenges associated with Apple's 802.11 Wi-Fi subsystem.
