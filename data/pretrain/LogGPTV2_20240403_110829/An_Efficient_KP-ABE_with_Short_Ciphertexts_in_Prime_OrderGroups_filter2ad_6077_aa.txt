ABSTRACT
We introduce an eﬃcient Key-Policy Attribute-Based En-
cryption (KP-ABE) scheme in prime order groups. Our
scheme is semi-adaptively secure under the decisional lin-
ear assumption and supports a large universe of attributes
and multi-use of attributes. Those properties are critical for
real applications of KP-ABE schemes since they enable an
eﬃcient and ﬂexible access control. Prior to our work, ex-
isting KP-ABE schemes with short ciphertexts were in com-
posite order groups or utilized either Dual Pairing Vector
Spaces (DPVS) or Dual System Groups (DSG) in prime or-
der groups. However, those techniques brought an eﬃciency
loss. In this work, we utilize a nested dual system encryp-
tion which is a variant of Waters’ dual system encryption
(Crypto’ 09) to achieve semi-adaptively secure KP-ABE. As
a result, we obtain a new scheme having better eﬃciency
compared to existing schemes while it keeps a semi-adaptive
security under the standard assumption. We implement our
scheme and compare its eﬃciency with the previous best
work.

INTRODUCTION
Attribute Based Encryption [37] (ABE) is a public key
based encryption system which allows users to access secret
data based on their attributes. The concept of ABE was
reﬁned by Goyal, Pandey, Sahai and Waters [22]. They de-
ﬁned two types of ABE systems, namely, Key-Policy ABE
(KP-ABE) and Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE), based
on where an access policy is located. In KP-ABE, an access

policy is employed in a user’s private key while a ciphertext
is associated with a set of attributes.
One of the applications of ABE is to provide a ﬁne-grained
access control mechanism for large-scale IT systems (e.g.
cloud storage) [43, 40, 24]. To use a KP-ABE scheme in a
real system such as a cloud storage, eﬃciency and ﬂexibility
must be guaranteed. There exist important properties for
KP-ABE to satisfy both of them. In order to satisfy this
eﬃciency requirement, the KP-ABE scheme must be con-
structed in prime order groups. This means that it has sig-
niﬁcant beneﬁts not only in terms of low computation costs
but also because of the shorter parameters. It is well-known
that the pairing computation and exponentiation in prime
order groups are more than ﬁfty times faster than those in
composite order groups [19]. This performance gap between
prime order groups and composite order groups cannot be
ignored in a practical usage. Additionally, eﬃciency is im-
proved further by the achievement of constant-size cipher-
texts. The beneﬁts of reducing the size of ciphertexts of the
KP-ABE system are due to the fact that they are directly
related to the amount of data traﬃc or the size of the cloud
data storage.
To support ﬂexibility, the KP-ABE scheme should be ex-
pressive and allow multi-use of attributes. Therefore, it can
be used to support any boolean functions for access controls
without any pre-processing or encoding to work around the
restriction of an appearance of attributes in the access policy
to be adapted to any situation while the system is operating
and growing. Moreover, the scheme can be more ﬂexible by
supporting a large universe of attributes. In KP-ABE with
a large universe of attributes, the public parameter does not
depend on the total number of attributes in the system. This
is useful for a growing IT system. In this setting, the system
developer does not need to consider all attributes at the ini-
tialization stage. It is also ﬂexible since operators can add
new attributes to the system whenever required (simply via
allocating unique IDs for new attributes in the system while
the system is operating).
1.1 Our Contribution
In this paper, we introduce an expressive semi-adaptively
secure KP-ABE scheme in prime order groups under the
standard assumptions. Our scheme features both eﬃciency
and ﬂexibility because our scheme has a short ciphertext
and supports a large universe of attributes and multi-use
823of attributes. Compared to existing similar schemes, our
scheme shows a better eﬃciency without a loss of ﬂexibility.
Currently, the best scheme is proposed by Agrawal and
Chase [3]. Their scheme is based on Attrapadung’s scheme
[4] which is originally adaptively secure in composite or-
der groups under q-type assumptions. They showed that
this scheme was also semi-adaptive secure in prime order
groups under standard assumptions. While semi-adaptive
security is weaker than the adaptive security, it is still rea-
sonable since the adversary can see the public parameters
before it declares the target ciphertext. Their scheme re-
mains the most eﬃcient scheme (in particular, the scheme
under the Symmetric External Diﬃe-Hellman (SXDH) as-
sumption) among the schemes supporting both prime order
groups and a large universe.
In this work, we suggest a new KP-ABE scheme with
a short ciphertext. Our scheme outperforms Agrawal and
Chase’s scheme even under a weaker assumption (the De-
cisional Linear (DLIN) assumption). Simply, for each at-
tribute in a ciphertext and a key ciphertext, Agrawal and
Chase’s scheme needs two group elements, but ours need
only a group element and an integer. In practice, replacing
a group element with an integer reduced the size of cipher-
texts and keys signiﬁcantly. For example, in popular Miyaji,
Nakabayashi and Takano (MNT) groups [31], the size of an
integer is only a half of a group element of G1 and one-sixth
of a group element of G2 where G1 and G2 are left and right
inputs of pairing computation e (i.e. e : G1 × G2 → GT ).
Moreover, our scheme has faster encryption and decryption.
The number of pairing computations of our scheme is con-
stant while the number of pairing operations of Agrawal
and Chase’s scheme increases linearly as the number of at-
tributes used in a decryption increases. We implement our
scheme and Agrawal and Chase’s scheme for comparison.
Our scheme reduces the encryption and decryption time by
more than 35 percent and 14 percent compared to those of
Agrawal and Chase’s scheme.
Comparisons with other schemes having short ciphertexts
are shown in Table 1. The ﬁrst expressive KP-ABE with
short ciphertexts was introduced by Attrapadung, Libert
and Panaﬁeu [7]. However, it is only selectively secure un-
der q-type assumption and supports a small universe of at-
tributes. Later, Attrapadung [4] introduced an adaptively
secure KP-ABE scheme with a constant size ciphertext. How-
ever, their scheme is ineﬃcient since it was introduced in
composite order groups, and it still relies its security on
q-type assumptions. More recently, Attrapadung [5] intro-
duced a technique to convert ABE schemes in composite
order groups to the schemes in prime order groups. There-
fore, the scheme from [4] can be featured into prime order
groups while it is still adaptively secure. However, the origi-
nal construction depends on q-type assumptions. Therefore,
the resulting scheme depends also on multiple assumptions
including two q-type assumptions. According to Cheon [16]
and Sakemi et al.
[38], the schemes under q-type assump-
tions are vulnerable in practice since they can be broken by
speciﬁc attacks. Takashima [39] uses a sparse DPVS and
achieves semi-adaptively security in prime order groups un-
der the standard assumption. Their scheme is more expres-
sive than the other schemes since it supports non-monotone
access policy, but their scheme is less eﬃcient than Agrawal
and Chase’s scheme and ours.
1.2 Our Technique
Water’s dual system encryption [41] is a well-known proof
technique for public key cryptography. In the dual system
encryption, keys and ciphertexts in a construction, namely
normal keys and normal ciphertexts, are changed to auxil-
iary types, namely semi-functional keys and semi-functional
ciphertexts which are only used in a security proof. Semi-
functional keys cannot decrypt semi-functional ciphertexts,
but they can decrypt normal ciphertexts while normal keys
can decrypt both semi-functional ciphertexts and normal ci-
phertexts. Then, it must be shown that a security game
consisting of only semi-functional keys and semi-functional
ciphertexts is indistinguishable from a real game which con-
sists of normal keys and normal ciphertext. To do this,
ﬁrst, the challenge ciphertext is changed from normal type
to semi-functional type (i.e., semi-functional ciphertext in-
variance). Then, it changes all keys from normal type to
semi-functional type one by one (i.e., semi-functional key
invariance). After the types of all keys and the challenge ci-
phertext are changed to semi-functional, the proof of the se-
curity (semi-functional security) is relatively easy since keys
cannot decrypt the challenge ciphertext due to their semi-
functionality.
In the dual system encryption, proving the semi-functional
key invariance is most critical. However, achieving the semi-
functional key invariance for ABE schemes is a daunting
task. In KP-ABE, a challenge key and the challenge cipher-
text have multiple attributes where the challenge key is a key
of which the simulator wants to distinguish the type. Addi-
tionally, those attributes can appear in both the challenge
key and the challenge ciphertext at the same time unless
an access structure of the key was not satisﬁed by a set of
attributes for the challenge ciphertext. Moreover, achieving
KP-ABE with short ciphertexts in a large attribute universe
is more diﬃcult since the total number of attributes in the
system is not bounded or exponentially large since we must
reuse limited entropy to unbounded attributes.
We solve those problems by utilizing a nested dual system
encryption. We let a row of a private key denote correspond-
ing key elements of a row of an access matrix. Also, we let
a semi-functional row denote a row of which correspond-
ing key elements have the same distribution with those of
a semi-functional key. In our security analysis, proving the
invariance between a normal key and a semi-functional key
is replaced by showing the invariance of a normal row and
a semi-functional row.
Instead of changing all rows from
normal to semi-functional at once, we change each row of
an access matrix of the challenge key from normal to semi-
functional one-by-one until a normal key turns to a semi-
functional key.
The way of converting a normal row to a semi-functional
one is similar to that of Waters’ Identity Based Encryption
(IBE) [41]. In IBE scheme, users have a key based on their
identities and the ciphertext is created only for a single iden-
tity. We consider IBE scheme as the simplest ABE scheme.
In the analysis of our KP-ABE scheme, we can isolate an
attribute from other attributes using the nested dual sys-
tem encryption similar to IBE. This allows us to apply the
technique of Waters’ IBE to convert the corresponding row
to semi-functional.
However, we must solve two problems to apply Waters’
technique to our scheme. Firstly, the isolated attribute can
appear in the challenge ciphertext.

of Waters’ IBE, the adversary only can query the keys if
the identities for the queried keys are diﬀerent from that
of the challenge ciphertext. To overcome this diﬀerence,
we only change rows of the challenge key from normal to
semi-functional if their corresponding attributes are not in
the target set of attributes in the challenge ciphertext. Be-
cause our scheme is semi-adaptively secure, the simulator
knows the target set of attributes before it generates any
keys. Therefore, it always can choose those rows in the in-
variance proof.
Secondly, in our scheme, the challenge ciphertext still has
multiple attributes unlike IBE scheme because we only nest
attributes in a key, not the challenge ciphertext. Since Wa-
ters’ IBE uses pairwise independence which allows only one
attribute in the ciphertext, we need an alternative infor-
mation theoretical argument for our scheme. We solve this
problem by using n-wise independence [6]. If we let Ax de-
note the xth row of A, T ags for the Ax, kT agj,x ∀j ∈ [n] and
a tag for the challenge ciphertext, cT ag, are generated as
