I think that bootstrap should include icons on alert messages
(errors/warnings/info/etc) by default. Having icons on alert messages would
increase WCAG 2.0 (accessibility) across the web. The icons would allow
colorblind users to understand messages easier.
Drupal had to solve this problem recently. Here's the issue where they
discussed it: http://drupal.org/node/874370
I recognize this as a duplicate of #54 but I thought it might be time to
revisit it since there are now icons available in the 2.0.
Looking through the icons, I don't actually see any that would fit for the
alert messages. But perhaps we could find another solution.
Love to hear reactions to this.
