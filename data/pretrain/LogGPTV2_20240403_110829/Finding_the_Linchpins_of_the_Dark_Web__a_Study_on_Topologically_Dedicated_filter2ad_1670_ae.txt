### Table VIII: TDS Prevalence per Feed
As described in Section V-B, we identify TDSes (Traffic Distribution Systems) from their URLs, which exhibit unique patterns based on the toolkits they are built upon. A recent report [7] indicates that, similar to the kits extensively used by exploit services, there is a wide range of off-the-shelf TDS kits available for adversaries to manage, administer, and log traffic. Among these, the most popular ones are Sutra TDS, Simple TDS, and Advanced TDS.

Using known URL patterns, we find that the Sutra TDS kit is the most prevalent, covering 71.02% of the TDS URLs in our dataset. Sutra is not a free kit, with prices ranging from $200 to $270, but it offers a broad array of features [13]. The second most popular kit is the Simple TDS, an open-source solution that covers 10.19% of the TDS URLs.

**Prevalence:**
In Section V-B, we demonstrate that TDSes account for a significant portion of all detected dedicated HICs (High-Interaction Clients): 52.67% of doorway URLs direct web traffic to these TDSes. Table VIII further highlights the crucial role TDSes play in channeling traffic from various data sources. Except for Warningbird, all other data sources have a substantial number of URLs leading to TDSes. We also find that TDSes are prevalent in paths not flagged by ForeFront.

**Inbound Traffic:**
Over 97.1% of TDSes receive web traffic directly from doorways, while only 6.37% get traffic from non-doorway redirectors. For the doorways that bring traffic to TDSes, some are intentional, such as adult sites. Many others are compromised sites.

**Figure 12: Cumulative Percentage of New Doorway Domains and IP Addresses Redirecting Traffic to TDSes During Our 7-Month Crawling Period**
The figure shows a step function, indicating that doorway domains are often compromised and set up by attackers in batches, corresponding to different attack campaigns. Thus, analyzing incoming traffic to TDSes can help detect attack campaigns. It is also worth noting that there is sharing of IP addresses among compromised doorway domains. In total, there are 18,369 new doorway pages and 12,711 unique IP addresses.

**TDS Status:**
- **Parked:** 69.66%
- **Inactive:** 12.69%
- **Suspended:** 8.58%
- **Appears to be down:** 0.03%
- **Redirecting to search engines:** 15.50%

**Table IX: Landscape of TDS Operation**
| TDS Status | URLs (%) | Hosts (%) | Paths (%) |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Parked | 69.66 | 23.9 | 55.65 |
| Inactive | 12.69 | 12.25 | 1.14 |
| Suspended | 8.58 | 51.07 | 4.91 |
| Appears to be down | 0.03 | 2.58 | 0.004 |
| Redirecting to search engines | 15.50 | 41.43 | - |
| Total | 126,180 | 3,168 | 2,211,291 |

**Outbound Traffic:**
During our crawling, we observed that some TDSes do not redirect traffic to other websites. These inactive TDSes can be suspended for resale, parked, or appear to be down (not resolving to an IP address or returning error response codes). Table IX provides a breakdown of the inactive TDSes.

**Note:**
TDSes that return error response codes may not be truly inactive. It has been reported that TDS toolkits can perform IP filtering [13][7]. This finding is confirmed by our analysis of the Simple TDS kit. We observed that among TDSes crawled multiple times, some lead to exploit servers initially but later return 404 responses or forward the crawler to google.com on subsequent visits. Table X provides a more detailed intersection between live TDSes and TDSes in other categories, showing that 23.08% of live TDSes are taken down in subsequent visits.

**Table X: Active TDSes Appearing in Other Categories**
| Category | Number | Percentage |
|----------|--------|------------|
| In parked hosts | 21 | 3.11% |
| In suspended hosts | 0 | - |
| In hosts not resolving | 156 | 23.08% |
| In hosts responding with error codes | 205 | 30.33% |

**Attack Types:**
We further studied the attack types associated with active TDS paths, excluding those that cloak by leading to search engines. 49.11% connect to exploit servers, 3.40% go to scam sites, and 60.80% redirect to places where the attack type cannot be confirmed. The percentages do not add up to 100% because some TDS hosts lead to multiple types of attacks.

### B. TDS Hosting Infrastructure
As discussed, we study TDSes as representatives of topologically dedicated hosts. For this type of service, we aim to understand how these services, at least their domains, are hosted. Our research reveals that TDS hosts extensively utilize free web services like free domain providers and dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers. DDNS providers such as freetcp.com allow users to register sub-domains (e.g., aaa.freetcp.com) and resolve them to their own IPs. Similarly, free domain providers such as uni.me offer sub-domains for free, but unlike DDNS services, they provide free hosting on their IP addresses.

To quantify the TDSes hosted by different infrastructures, we used known lists to identify free domain providers, DDNS providers, and URL shorteners. These lists are downloaded from malwaredomains.com and updated daily. Using these lists, we found that:
- 26.44% of TDSes use DDNS.
- 14.39% use free domain providers.
- 0.7% use URL shorteners.

These figures are lower bounds, as the lists may be incomplete. Additionally, many TDSes share IP addresses. The top 12% of IP addresses cover 21.5% of TDSes. Interestingly, many TDSes' IP addresses share IP prefixes. The top 5 (out of 131) autonomous system numbers (ASNs) associated with these TDSes belong to a few small cloud and hosting service providers, as shown in Table XI.

**Table XI: Top 5 ASNs Hosting TDSes**
| # | ASN# | ASN Name | Country | Number of IPs |
|---|------|----------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | 16265 | LEASEWEB | NL | 45 |
| 2 | 24940 | HETZNER | DE | 33 |
| 3 | 28753 | LEASEWEB-DE | DE | 19 |
| 4 | 44050 | PIN-AS | RU | 13 |
| 5 | 21788 | NOC-Network | US | 10 |

### C. TDS Malicious Lifetime
During our investigations, we observed that, unlike exploit domains, TDSes tend to have a longer lifespan before detection. In this section, we estimate their lifetimes using the "PassiveDNS" dataset, which contains DNS records collected by the Security Information Exchange (SIE) [26] since April 2010. Each record includes two timestamps to indicate the first and last times the record was observed with the same value (i.e., the Rdata field in a DNS packet).

To identify the malicious lifespan of a given host, we found that considering only the time between the first and last valid A record (IP address lookup) is insufficient. Even after a malicious domain is taken down, it may be acquired by a domain registrar who wants to sell it, during which it has a valid DNS record and is resolvable. Therefore, we took a more conservative approach to estimate a lower bound of a host's malicious lifespan. This lower bound is based on the time interval between the first and last observed A records carrying at least one IP address of a given host discovered by our crawler when it is associated with malicious activities.

**Observations:**
Querying the "PassiveDNS" dataset, we retrieved DNS records for 1,334 TDS hostnames. Table XII lists the malicious lifetimes per hosting type (DDNS, Free Domain hosts, and others). The standard deviations in all categories are high, so we also consider their medians. The median malicious lifetime for hosts running on possibly dedicated domains (in the "neither" category) is 65.21 days, much higher than most malicious domains reported in the literature (e.g., 2.5 hours [8]). Some TDS hosts live for years. For example, tr-af.com has been resolving to the same IP address since January 11, 2011, and is still active. Interestingly, we found that hosts using DDNS tend to be taken down sooner than those using free domain providers, likely due to the difference in their operations.

**Table XII: TDS Malicious Lifetimes in Days**
| Hosting Type | Mean (d) | Median (d) | Standard Deviation (d) | Total # of TDSes |
|--------------|----------|------------|------------------------|------------------|
| DDNS hosts | 43.20 | 99.02 | 5.75 | 371 |
| Free domain hosts | 105.32 | 128.74 | 61.76 | 154 |
| Neither | 138.59 | 200.88 | 65.21 | 745 |

### D. TDS Parking
In Section VI-A, we discovered that 51% of TDS paths were parked. This high presence of domain parking warrants a closer look into the motivations behind such behavior.

**Legitimate Domain Parking:**
Parking services offer a way for newly acquired, underdeveloped domains, or domains reserved for future use to monetize their traffic through advertising. Domains can be parked by setting the authoritative name server (NS) record to point to that of the parking services or using a redirector to send traffic to the parking services. There are two ways for monetization: traditional contextual ads or ZeroClick, which redirects visitors directly to an advertiser's webpage. Parking services typically allow only real user type-in traffic and do not permit third-party sites to redirect to parked domains.

**TDS Parking:**
TDSes receive redirections from many doorway pages, generating a lot of incoming traffic. As doorway pages usually reside on compromised domains owned by different entities, it is challenging to clean all of them quickly. Therefore, even if an attack is detected and the corresponding malicious domains are taken down, there could still be a lot of traffic leading to TDSes. Domainers leverage this rich source of traffic by purchasing suspended domains and monetizing their traffic through domain parking. Our dataset shows that 51.07% of the paths lead to parked TDSes. Using "PassiveDNS," we identified 642 parked TDSes by checking whether the NS record or the hosting IP belongs to a parking service. The top 10 parking services and the number of TDSes parked with them are shown in Table XIII.

**Table XIII: Top 10 Parking Services for TDSes**
| Parking Service | Number of TDSes Parked |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Bodis Parking | 263 |
| Dopa Parking | - |
| Oversee Parking | - |

Bodis Parking is the most popular parking service targeted by new domain owners of TDS hosts, used to park 263 different TDS hosts. Besides parking services, there are also parking managers who offer a centralized approach to manage a portfolio of domains parked with multiple parking services. Above.com is one such parking manager acting as a middleman.
