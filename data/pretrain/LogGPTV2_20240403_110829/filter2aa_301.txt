### Introduction
As ethical hackers, we often assume that phishing should be as straightforward for us as it is for malicious actors. The typical process involves:
1. Crafting a convincing email that directs recipients to a website.
2. Building a simple web form to collect credentials.
3. Gaining client approval for the email and landing page.
4. Sending the email to a large number of employees.
5. Collecting the passwords.

Sometimes, this process works seamlessly, with success rates ranging from 10% to 40%. However, it's not always that simple.

### An Unusual Success
Larry once conducted a phishing campaign that achieved a success rate exceeding 100%. The targeted company had a subset of employees, and the call to action—"Give us your passwords or we cut off your access"—was highly effective. Employees even forwarded the phishing email to their colleagues, and all tested accounts were compromised.

### Why Phish?
A professional phishing engagement should aim to "harden" an organization's staff by:
- Increasing individual resilience.
- Training the organization in collaborative detection.

After a few campaigns, employees are more likely to detect scams and report them at higher rates.

### Why This Talk?
Most people's initial attempts at professional phishing are not as successful. Years ago, our consultants faced numerous frustrations. This talk will detail these challenges and provide solutions to help you avoid them and achieve success.

### Layer 8: Human Factors
This discussion isn't about red team phishing, which typically involves small, targeted attacks. Instead, we'll share eleven stories of failure and their specific solutions. Setting up any professional phishing campaign involves:
- Collaboration
- Communication
- Negotiation

### Red Team Phishing vs. Penetration Test Phishing
- **Red Team Phishing**:
  - Aimed at gaining initial access.
  - Small target pool (usually 1-2 emails).
  - Manually determined targets using open-source reconnaissance.
  - Stealthy, low-and-slow approach.
  - Pretext focused on specific job functions.
  - Use Gmail or Office365 for whitelisting.

- **Penetration Test Phishing**:
  - Broader scope, testing the entire organization.
  - More complex and requires careful planning and execution.

### Eleven Stories of Phishing Failures and Solutions

#### Story 1: Schedule Fail
- **Scenario**: We provided three scenarios to a client, who chose one. The URL was built and sent for approval, but the manager objected, disrupting the schedule.
- **Solution**: 
  - Guide the client through the process from the beginning.
  - Identify key decision-makers and explain the risk of late-stage vetoes.
  - Set and remind the organization of deadlines.
  - Prototype pretexts and involve the client in their development.
  - Realize that you're in a multi-party negotiation and manage it accordingly.

#### Story 2: SPAM Filters
- **Scenario**: Emails didn't pass through the organization's spam filters due to new or misconfigured domains.
- **Solution**:
  - Configure SPF, DKIM, and MTA properly.
  - Use a domain that has existed for at least a week.
  - Request a spam filter whitelist and test it.

#### Story 3: Numbers Game Fail
- **Scenario**: Limited email addresses were obtained, making it difficult to test the entire organization.
- **Solution**:
  - Present options to the client, such as providing a comprehensive list of email addresses.
  - Discuss the possibility of brute-forcing mail servers or buying mailing lists.

#### Story 4: The Open Floor Plan
- **Scenario**: The phishing email was quickly exposed in an open floor plan environment.
- **Solution**:
  - Know your target and their communication methods.
  - Involve the client and management in pretext brainstorming to catch potential issues early.

#### Story 5: Low and Slow
- **Scenario**: Slow email distribution led to quick detection and alerting.
- **Solution**:
  - Emphasize speed in phishing campaigns.
  - Create a sense of urgency in the email to prompt immediate action.

#### Story 6: Poor Domain Choice
- **Scenario**: Using a slightly altered domain (e.g., elilily.com) that employees easily spotted.
- **Solution**:
  - Use domain names that include the company's true name (e.g., elililly-benefits.com).
  - Check and agree on domain names with the organization and colleagues.

#### Story 7: Broken Grammar
- **Scenario**: Using poor grammar and spelling to simulate weak phishes, leading to lower success rates.
- **Solution**:
  - Explain the importance of well-written phishing emails.
  - Offer to conduct rounds with both good and broken grammar.

#### Story 8: The Investigation
- **Scenario**: Insufficient involvement of HR, Legal, etc., leading to investigations.
- **Solution**:
  - Make involving all relevant departments a mandatory part of the test.
  - Understand the escalation paths and place debugger breakpoints accordingly.

#### Story 9: Success and an Unhappy Client
- **Scenario**: The campaign was successful, but the client felt under-communicated or overly communicative.
- **Solution**:
  - Provide frequent updates, especially during the first day.
  - Manage expectations by setting clear communication intervals.

#### Story 10: Re-inventing the Wheel
- **Scenario**: Repeatedly creating new infrastructure for each campaign, leading to inefficiency.
- **Solution**:
  - Use existing tools like Phishing Frenzy or develop your own.
  - Automate processes to reduce errors and save time.

#### Story 11: Unknown Impact
- **Scenario**: Lack of follow-up to understand the campaign's impact.
- **Solution**:
  - Plan how to inform affected staff and focus on proactive improvement.
  - Monitor reporting rates, escalation, and alerting improvements.
  - Recommend regular self-phishing exercises for the organization.

### Overall Lesson
Phishing is fundamentally about collaboration, communication, and negotiation. Most failures stem from a lack of foresight and effective communication. Use and share these stories to persuade, plan, and succeed. Remember, if anyone loses in a negotiation, everyone loses.
