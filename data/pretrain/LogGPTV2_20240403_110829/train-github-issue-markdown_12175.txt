 **Describe the bug**
When you use the copy method from the InstancedBufferGeometry the
instanceCount attribute is copied by defualt. This could lead to errors, since
the copy method accepts any kind of geometry and for this reason the
instanceCount could be set to undefined.
**To Reproduce**
call InstancedBufferGeometry .copy passing a BufferGeometry of a Geometry and
the instanceCount will be set to undefined
**Expected behavior**
The copy method should check the type of the geometry passed as input and only
if it is an InstancedBufferGeometry the instanceCount should be copied.
**Platform:**
  * All
  * Three.js version: [master]
