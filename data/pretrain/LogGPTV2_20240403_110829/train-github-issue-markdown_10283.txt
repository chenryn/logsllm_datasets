Subject: Feature Request: Access to Function Source Code

Dear Julia Development Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request the implementation of a feature that would allow users to access the source code of a function by simply typing in the function name. This functionality, which is available in R, is incredibly useful for understanding and learning from high-quality, performant code.

For reference, an article discussing this topic can be found [here](http://dorophone.blogspot.de/2011/07/duckspeak-vs-smalltalk.html).

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
