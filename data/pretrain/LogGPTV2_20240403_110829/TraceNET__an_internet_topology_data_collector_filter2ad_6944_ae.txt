### Topology Discovery Tools and Commercial ISPs

One of the primary challenges in using topology discovery tools with commercial ISPs is that their original topologies are proprietary and not publicly available. In our work, we address this issue by employing a cross-validation method. We run `tracenet` from three different vantage points, targeting the same set of IP addresses, to evaluate the level of agreement or disagreement among the observed subnets.

### Cross-Validation Results

Our results show that all three vantage points agree on approximately 60% of the collected subnets. Additionally, about 80% of the subnets collected by a particular vantage point are verified by at least one other vantage point. However, some subnets appear larger when collected from different vantage points. This discrepancy can be attributed to rate limiting by routers or ISPs, which may regulate their responsiveness based on traffic load or other rate-limiting policies.

Consistently across all vantage points, most subnets in the non-edge Internet are identified as point-to-point links of /31 or /30 subnets. This is followed by /29 subnets, with a sharp decrease after /29, and a small increase for /24 subnets. We believe that /24 is a de-facto standard subnet mask for small to medium organizations, but many of these organizations are also behind probe-blocking firewalls.

### Experimental Setup

For our experimental setup, we used PlanetLab sites at Rice University, the University of Oregon, and the University of Massachusetts as vantage points, located in the south, west, and east of the United States, respectively. We targeted a set of 34,084 IP addresses belonging to four major ISPs: Sprintlink, AboveNet, Level3, and NTT America. This target set did not include IP addresses belonging to the customers of these ISPs.

### Distribution of Matching Subnets

Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of exactly matching subnets collected from the three PlanetLab vantage points. Approximately 80% of the subnets observed from one vantage point are also observed from at least one other vantage point. Around 60% of the subnets from a particular vantage point are observed from all three vantage points. The selection of these vantage points was made to ensure that `tracenet` probes enter each ISP from different border routers and take different paths towards the destination IP addresses. Consequently, around 20% of the subnets are uniquely observed by each vantage point, reflecting the diversity in border routers and paths.

### Analysis of Subnetized and Unsubnetized IP Addresses

For each vantage point, we analyzed the number of target IP addresses, the number of IP addresses placed into subnets, and the number of IP addresses for which `tracenet` failed to grow a subnet. Figure 7 shows the distribution of target, subnetized, and unsubnetized IP addresses at different PlanetLab sites. SprintLink appears to be the least responsive ISP, with a higher number of unsubnetized IP addresses compared to other ISPs. At the Rice site, the total number of subnetized and unsubnetized IP addresses is less than the number of target IP addresses, indicating that not all target IP addresses responded to our probe packets.

NTT America, on the other hand, is the most responsive ISP. The number of unsubnetized IP addresses for SprintLink is large, but the number of subnetized IP addresses is comparable to those of Level3 and AboveNET. This can be explained by the path lengths and the number of responsive routers on the discovered subnets.

### Subnet Distribution per ISP

Figure 8 shows the distribution of the total number of subnets per ISP at the three vantage points. The numbers of collected subnets from each ISP are similar across all vantage points. A counterintuitive observation is that while NTT America has the largest number of subnetized IP addresses, it has the least number of subnets. This is because NTT America hosts large subnets (e.g., /20, /21, /22), whereas other ISPs host smaller subnets (e.g., /30, /31). Thus, a small number of large subnets can host more IP addresses than a large number of small subnets.

### Subnet Prefix Length Distribution

Figure 9 displays the distribution of subnet prefix lengths at the three vantage points on a logarithmic scale. The figure shows a significant decrease between /30 and /29, and an even sharper decrease between /29 and /28. Most links are point-to-point (/31 and /30), followed by multi-access links (/29), with a dramatic decrease in the number of subnets thereafter.

### Performance with Different Probing Protocols

In our final experiment, we investigated the performance of `tracenet` with different probing protocols (ICMP, UDP, and TCP) over the four ISPs. Table 3 summarizes the number of subnets collected with each protocol. ICMP outperforms UDP and TCP in terms of the number of collected subnets, supporting recent observations that routers respond better to ICMP probes.

### Conclusions

Topology discovery studies rely on various data sources to create accurate network maps. Among these, traceroute is the most prevalent tool. In this study, we developed `tracenet`, a router-level Internet topology collector that collects topology information for each visited subnet on the path from a source to a destination. `Tracenet` can disclose a large number of IP addresses, form multi-access and point-to-point links, detect "same LAN" associations, and annotate subnets with their observed prefix values. This tool can significantly improve the completeness and correctness of current and future topology mapping studies. An implementation of `tracenet` is publicly available on our project website: http://itom.utdallas.edu.
