Question: "When developing an Android application, the security of the private key used for signing the APK is crucial. If a malicious actor gains access to this key, what are the potential consequences, and how can developers mitigate this risk?"
 "A": "The malicious actor can publish updates to the app with unauthorized content, and to mitigate this, developers should store keys in a secure KeyStore with a strong password known only to the key creator."
 "B": "The malicious actor can only view the app's source code without being able to modify the application, and developers should use obfuscation to prevent this."
 "C": "The malicious actor can decrypt user data, and developers should implement additional encryption algorithms to protect user data."
 "D": "The malicious actor can alter the app's functionality, but this poses no significant threat since app stores will detect and block malicious updates."
Answer: A
