Abstract—Our study analyzes the security and privacy prop-
erties of an implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator (ICD). Intro-
duced to the U.S. market in 2003, this model of ICD includes
pacemaker technology and is designed to communicate wirelessly
with a nearby external programmer in the 175 kHz frequency
range. After partially reverse-engineering the ICD’s communi-
cations protocol with an oscilloscope and a software radio, we
implemented several software radio-based attacks that could
compromise patient safety and patient privacy. Motivated by
our desire to improve patient safety, and mindful of conventional
trade-offs between security and power consumption for resource-
constrained devices, we introduce three new zero-power defenses
based on RF power harvesting. Two of these defenses are human-
centric, bringing patients into the loop with respect to the security
and privacy of their implantable medical devices (IMDs). Our
contributions provide a scientiﬁc baseline for understanding the
potential security and privacy risks of current and future IMDs,
and introduce human-perceptible and zero-power mitigation
techniques that address those risks. To the best of our knowledge,
this paper is the ﬁrst in our community to use general-purpose
software radios to analyze and attack previously unknown radio
communications protocols.
I. INTRODUCTION
Wirelessly reprogrammable implantable medical devices
(IMDs) such as pacemakers, implantable cardioverter deﬁbril-
lators (ICDs), neurostimulators, and implantable drug pumps
use embedded computers and radios to monitor chronic disor-
ders and treat patients with automatic therapies. For instance,
an ICD that senses a rapid heartbeat can administer an elec-
trical shock to restore a normal heart rhythm, then later report

this event to a health care practitioner who uses a commercial
device programmer1 with wireless capabilities to extract data
from the ICD or modify its settings without surgery. Between
1990 and 2002, over 2.6 million pacemakers and ICDs were
implanted in patients in the United States [19]; clinical trials
have shown that these devices signiﬁcantly improve survival
rates in certain populations [18]. Other research has discussed
potential security and privacy risks of IMDs [1], [10], but we
are unaware of any rigorous public investigation into the ob-
servable characteristics of a real commercial device. Without
such a study, it is impossible for the research community to
assess or address the security and privacy properties of past,
current, and future devices. We address that gap in this paper
and, based on our ﬁndings, propose and implement several
prototype attack-mitigation techniques.
Our investigation was motivated by an interdisciplinary
study of medical device safety and security, and relied on
a diverse team of area specialists. Team members from
the security and privacy community have formal
training
in computer science, computer engineering, and electrical
engineering. One team member from the medical community
is a practicing cardiologist with hundreds of pacemaker and
implantable deﬁbrillator patients and was past chairperson
of the FDA’s Circulatory System Medical Device Advisory
Panel. Our technical contributions toward understanding and
improving the security, privacy, and safety of these devices
include: analyses; software radio-based methodologies; and
human-perceptible and zero-power (battery-free) defenses.
Overview of contributions. We assess the security and pri-
vacy properties of a common ICD and present attacks on
privacy,
the ICD
discloses sensitive information in the clear (unencrypted);
we demonstrate a reprogramming attack that changes the
operation of (and the information contained in) the ICD; and
integrity, and availability. We show that

who programs computers. The former is an external device that communicates
with and adjusts the settings on an IMD.

we give evidence that a battery-powered ICD can be made
to communicate indeﬁnitely with an unauthenticated device,
thereby posing a potential denial-of-service risk. All of our
attacks can be mounted by an unauthorized party equipped
with a specially conﬁgured radio communicator within range
of the ICD. In our experiments, we performed attacks from
distances up to several centimeters; we did not experiment
with increasing this range. We also present prototype defenses
against the attacks we describe.
Developing these attacks and defenses required some un-
derstanding of relevant devices and protocols. We give an
account of our attempts to reverse-engineer communications
to and from the ICD using a commercial ICD programmer
and a software radio; we believe that this work is the ﬁrst in
our community to successfully use general purpose software
radios in the reverse engineering of wireless protocols for secu-
rity analysis. Information directly available from RF signals,
given knowledge gained from reverse engineering, includes
patient information (such as name and diagnosis) and medical
telemetry (information about vital signs); we demonstrate this
breach of privacy by showing redacted transmissions. We
also demonstrate active attacks on device integrity wherein
an unauthorized software radio transmitter (or unauthorized
external programmer) that follows a certain protocol can
change information on the ICD, including therapy settings
that determine when the device should administer an electric
shock; the unauthorized radio transmitter can also make the
ICD issue a commanded electrical shock. Finally, we describe
our discovery that an attacker can keep an ICD in a state
of elevated energy consumption, thereby potentially depleting
battery life and threatening availability. Table I provides a
summary of our attacks and their implications.
With the above attacks in mind, we present prototype
defenses against them. Our defenses comprise three different
deterrence and prevention mechanisms that sit at the interface
between an ICD and the outside world. Our defenses do not
require battery power and therefore may require only mini-
mal design changes to future implantable devices. We refer
to these mechanisms as zero-power defenses to emphasize
that they draw no energy from the primary battery, instead
harvesting RF energy from an external source. Zero-power
notiﬁcation audibly warns a patient of security-sensitive events
and can help mitigate the risk of attacks both by outsiders
who have custom equipment (like our software radio-based
attack system) and by insiders who have access to commercial
ICD programmers. Zero-power authentication uses symmetric
cryptographic techniques to prevent unauthorized access; it
aims to protect against adversaries who have custom equip-
ment. Finally, sensible security combines elements of zero-
power notiﬁcation and authentication by allowing patients
to physically sense an acoustic key exchange. We show the
effectiveness of these defenses by measuring the performance
of our prototype zero-power system, WISPer, which is a WISP
UHF RFID tag [25], [27] augmented with a piezo-element.
(Notationally, although WISPer is batteryless and is based
on RFID technologies, the term passive does not accurately
characterize the radio conversation that takes place.)
Our study examines a single Medtronic Maximo DR VVE-
DDDR model #7278 ICD. This model, introduced to the U.S.
market in 2003 [21], is a typical ICD: it incorporates pacemak-
ing (steady, periodic electrical stimulation) and deﬁbrillation
(single large shock) functions, and it communicates with an
external device programmer at a range of several centimeters.
Implications, challenges, and broader issues. Our study
focuses on a single ICD, and therefore provides only a small
snapshot in the evolution and breadth of ICD technologies
and more general implantable medical devices. Nevertheless,
we believe that this snapshot is necessary toward assessing
the current trajectory of IMD security and privacy. We hope
that the analyses and defenses presented in this paper will
motivate broader scientiﬁc investigations into how to best
provide security, privacy, safety, and effectiveness for future
implantable medical devices. Improving IMD security and
privacy is, however, signiﬁcantly challenging due to rapidly
evolving threat models, trends toward longer-range wireless
communication, explorations into multi-agent systems of inter-
communicating IMDs [4], [7], [33], and resource constraints
of an IMD’s battery, processor, and memory. Moreover, as we
previously observed [10], there is tension between security
(restricted access) and safety (open access in emergency
scenarios); the zero-power notiﬁcation portion of our WISPer
prototype aims to address this tension.
Attack scenarios. Since health care is a very sensitive and
personal subject for many people, we explicitly choose to de-
viate from standard practice in the academic security research
community and do not describe speciﬁc scenarios in which an
attacker might compromise the privacy or health of a victim.
We also do not discuss the potential impact on patients if an
adversary were to carry out an attack in vivo. Rather, when
discussing attacks we focus solely on the technical properties
of those attacks. In addition, in each case where we identify a
vulnerability, we propose a solution or technical direction to
mitigate it.
Context. Pacemakers, ICDs, and other implantable medical
devices have improved and saved innumerable lives. To our
knowledge, no IMD patient has ever been harmed by a
malicious security attack. While our research demonstrates
that such a scenario is possible, our goals in conducting this
research are to: (1) demonstrate that IMD security and privacy
vulnerabilities exist; (2) propose solutions to the identiﬁed
weaknesses; (3) encourage the development of more robust
security and privacy features for IMDs; and (4) improve the
privacy and safety of IMDs for the millions of patients who
enjoy their beneﬁts. This paper, which focuses on a single ICD
and our zero-power defenses, should be read in concert with
our previous work [10], which surveys the potential security
and privacy issues for broad classes of IMDs independent of
any particular IMD technology.
Disclosure. In light of the rapid advances and changes in ICD
technology, we conducted this scientiﬁc investigation with the
