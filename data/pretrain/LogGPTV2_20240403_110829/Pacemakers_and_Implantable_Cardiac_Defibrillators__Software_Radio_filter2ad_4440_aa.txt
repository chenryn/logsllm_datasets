## Abstract
This study examines the security and privacy properties of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) introduced to the U.S. market in 2003. The ICD includes pacemaker technology and communicates wirelessly with an external programmer at a frequency of 175 kHz. By partially reverse-engineering the ICD's communication protocol using an oscilloscope and a software radio, we implemented several software radio-based attacks that could compromise patient safety and privacy. Motivated by the need to improve patient safety, and considering the trade-offs between security and power consumption for resource-constrained devices, we introduce three zero-power defenses based on RF power harvesting. Two of these defenses involve patients, bringing them into the loop regarding the security and privacy of their implantable medical devices (IMDs). Our contributions provide a scientific baseline for understanding the potential security and privacy risks of current and future IMDs and introduce human-perceptible and zero-power mitigation techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first paper in our community to use general-purpose software radios to analyze and attack previously unknown radio communication protocols.

## 1. Introduction
Wirelessly reprogrammable implantable medical devices (IMDs), such as pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), neurostimulators, and implantable drug pumps, use embedded computers and radios to monitor chronic disorders and deliver automatic therapies. For example, an ICD can detect a rapid heartbeat, administer an electrical shock to restore normal heart rhythm, and later report this event to a healthcare practitioner using a commercial device programmer with wireless capabilities. Between 1990 and 2002, over 2.6 million pacemakers and ICDs were implanted in U.S. patients, significantly improving survival rates in certain populations. While previous research has discussed potential security and privacy risks, no rigorous public investigation has been conducted into the observable characteristics of a real commercial device. This paper addresses this gap and proposes several prototype attack-mitigation techniques.

Our interdisciplinary team, comprising specialists in computer science, engineering, and cardiology, conducted this study. Our technical contributions include analyses, software radio-based methodologies, and zero-power (battery-free) defenses.

### Overview of Contributions
We assess the security and privacy properties of a common ICD and present several attacks:
- **Privacy Breach:** The ICD discloses sensitive information in the clear (unencrypted).
- **Reprogramming Attack:** Changes the operation and stored information in the ICD.
- **Integrity and Availability Threats:** A battery-powered ICD can be made to communicate indefinitely with an unauthenticated device, posing a denial-of-service risk.

All attacks can be mounted by an unauthorized party with a specially configured radio communicator within range of the ICD. We also present prototype defenses against these attacks.

### Reverse-Engineering and Attacks
Developing these attacks and defenses required some understanding of the relevant devices and protocols. We used a commercial ICD programmer and a software radio to reverse-engineer the ICD's communications. This work is the first in our community to successfully use general-purpose software radios for reverse engineering wireless protocols for security analysis. We demonstrate breaches of privacy by showing redacted transmissions and active attacks on device integrity, where an unauthorized transmitter can change therapy settings and command electrical shocks. We also discovered that an attacker can keep an ICD in a state of elevated energy consumption, potentially depleting battery life and threatening availability.

### Prototype Defenses
We present three zero-power defenses:
- **Zero-Power Notification:** Audibly warns patients of security-sensitive events, mitigating risks from both custom equipment and insiders with commercial programmers.
- **Zero-Power Authentication:** Uses symmetric cryptographic techniques to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Sensible Security:** Combines elements of zero-power notification and authentication, allowing patients to physically sense an acoustic key exchange.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of these defenses using WISPer, a WISP UHF RFID tag augmented with a piezo-element.

### Study Focus and Broader Implications
Our study focuses on a single Medtronic Maximo DR VVE-DDDR model #7278 ICD, introduced in 2003. While this provides only a snapshot of ICD technologies, it is necessary for assessing the current trajectory of IMD security and privacy. We hope our analyses and defenses will motivate broader scientific investigations into providing security, privacy, safety, and effectiveness for future IMDs. Improving IMD security and privacy is challenging due to evolving threat models, longer-range wireless communication, multi-agent systems, and resource constraints.

### Ethical Considerations
We do not describe specific attack scenarios or discuss the potential impact on patients if an adversary were to carry out an attack. Instead, we focus on the technical properties of the attacks and propose solutions or technical directions to mitigate vulnerabilities. Our goal is to demonstrate the existence of IMD security and privacy vulnerabilities, propose solutions, encourage robust security features, and improve the privacy and safety of IMDs for millions of patients.
