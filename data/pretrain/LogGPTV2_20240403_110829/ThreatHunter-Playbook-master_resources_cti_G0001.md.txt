# G0001: Axiom
## Description
Axiom, a cyber espionage group, is suspected to have ties with the Chinese government. This group was responsible for the Operation SMN campaign (Citation: Novetta-Axiom). Although both Axiom and the Winnti Group (G0044) use the malware Winnti (S0141), they are believed to be distinct entities based on differences in their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as well as their targeting (Citations: Kaspersky Winnti April 2013, Kaspersky Winnti June 2015, Novetta Winnti April 2015).
