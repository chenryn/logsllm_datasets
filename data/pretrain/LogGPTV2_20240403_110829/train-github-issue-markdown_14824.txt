We have structured our files so that page specific code is in the pages
folder. Here is an example:
  * pages 
    * manage-users 
      * __tests__ 
        * manage-users.test.js
      * index.js
      * components 
        * ManageUsersPage.js
        * 
The index.js file has the ManageUsersPage.js components as its default export.
That is a regular next.js page component
This structure has worked fine for us except when we build. This hardcoded
glob assumes that all js files under pages is a page:

Does it make sense to make this glob overridable or do we have to not use file
based routing?
