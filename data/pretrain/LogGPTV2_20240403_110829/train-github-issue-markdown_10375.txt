Do we plan to support previous versions of our APIs? For example, should we continue to support v1beta1 inputs once v1beta2 is available? To handle this properly, we need to version the entire API, not just individual structures. Additionally, we should develop version-specific code that can translate older input formats into the most current form, ensuring that this translation process is well-isolated.

Furthermore, do we intend to support older versions in the output as well?

Implementing this correctly will be resource-intensive. We also need to draft a policy statement outlining our approach to API changes and deprecation policies.
