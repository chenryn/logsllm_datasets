Do we intend to support prior versions of APIs? E.g. Should we  
support v1beta1 inputs once we support v1beta2? To do that properly  
we need to version the whole API, not just individual structures, and  
we probably want version-specific code that translates old inputs to  
"most modern" form well isolated. And Then do we support old versions  
on output?
To do this "right" is very intensive.
We also need to write up a policy statement regarding API changes and
deprecation policies.
