ABSTRACT
We provide an approach for real-time analysis of ongoing
events in a controlled network. We propose ReasONets,
i.e. Reasoning on Networks, a distributed and lightweight
system, able to process and reason about anomalies and
incidents observed in closed networks. To the best of our
knowledge this is the ﬁrst system combining detections and
classiﬁcation of network events with real-time reasoning.
Our demo will show a running prototype of the ReasONets,
demonstrating the power and accuracy of the reasoning pro-
cess in presence of incidents of various nature.

INTRODUCTION
Detection is just one step in an overall plan to handle se-
curity incidents. Once detected, security incidents are typ-
ically forwarded to a Computer Securities Incident Detec-
tion Team (CSIRT), where security analysts triage and in-
vestigate incidents and formulate a response [6]. This work
is labor intensive and relies on extensive domain expertise.
The objective of our work is to provide an approach for
deeper and real-time understanding of ongoing events in a
controlled network. We aim to detect anomalies in the be-
havior of machines and inappropriate use of the network,
further identifying the nature and severity of the observed
security incidents.
We propose ReasONets, an eﬀective and lightweight sys-
tem, able to process and reason about anomalies and in-
cidents observed in closed networks. ReasONets combines
aspects of anomaly detection with Case-Based Reasoning

methodologies [2, 3], in order to provide situational aware-
ness in case of network incidents. Underlying the Case-
Based Reasoning process deployed within ReasONets is the
understanding that no security event will ever be identical
to previously experienced incidents in absolute terms, but
should show enough similarities to be qualiﬁed as an event
of a certain type. The understanding of anomalous events is
not gathered from rules or general statistics, but by the anal-
ysis of cases, where each case represents a speciﬁc type of
event which is already analyzed. Furthermore, we eﬀectively
control and model the uncertain and inaccurate information
collected in real-time, by exploiting the Fuzzy Logic The-
ory [5]. Adaptation is also included in our system:
if no
previous case matches an observed event, we adopt a rule-
based system to identify when new cases are to be adapted
and, possibly, merge existing previous cases. Adaptation is
supervised by the network administrator who assigns a se-
mantic meaning to the various cases, and conﬁgures system’s
parameters based on his experience and system knowledge.
The detection of a machine accessing malicious domains
is a simple yet eﬀective example demonstrating how Rea-
sONets diﬀers from common SIM/SEM/SOC systems. Com-
mon SIM/SEM/SOC systems usually rely on Black Lists
and White Lists, through which it is impossible to infer if a
“new” domain is a good one or not [1]. ReasONets uses a set
of metrics that allow infer the nature of a domain on-the-ﬂy.
In details, our system measures the content type (i.e. porno-
graphic, political, sport), and the geographical distance of
the domain respect to the closest known malicious domain.
Further, we check if the registrant is an organization that
owns other malicious domains, and if the domain is in the
same network of a well-known malicious domain. The added
value of our system is the capability to do inference on com-
pletely unknown domains, allowing us to obtain early identi-
ﬁcation of malicious domains, and their relationship (if any)
with existing ones.
2. THE REASONETS ARCHITECTURE
The design of the ReasONets system is presented in Figure
1. A three-layer multivariate analysis model is adopted. By
1010Misuse Detector. The Misuse Detector (MD)1 is in
charge of delineating the “normal behavior” of monitored
machines, and compare it with the registered machine’s be-
havior during monitoring. Speciﬁcally, the MD collects a
number of critical network and application metrics. For
each metric, the average value, and the range of variabil-
ity recorded is collected, and stored in records identiﬁed
by means of the Machine’s MAC address or Device ID.
The metrics set can be divided in two groups: Network
Level Metrics, aiming to measure network traﬃc activi-
ties; and Application Level Metrics, aiming approximate
the HTTP traﬃc generated by each monitored machine, dur-
ing its interaction with external machines and the Internet.
Reasoner. The Reasoner represents the core of our archi-
tecture, and it performs Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) [2] on
the events detected by the higher system layers. A case rep-
resents a known incident or security event, which has been
experienced in the system and addressed by administrators.
Each case is represented by a vector of signiﬁcant features,
each denoting a metric and the corresponding value range.
We adopt a knowledge base (KB) which currently collects
and models two classes of cases. First is the set of cases,
which represent the most common network spread malware
(e.g. Virus, Botnet, Worms, Keylogger). Second is the
set of non-malware related incidents, that can be observed
through network analysis. For example, access to a domain
with adult content, unauthorized access to a monitored ma-
chine from a remote one, or SQL Injections. The cases are
obtained using a hybrid approach that combines empirical
evaluations and analysis of well-known security incidents af-
fecting small enterprise networks. Cases are also dynami-
cally added to the ReasONets as they are experienced, ac-
cording to a set of adaptation rules within the model.
Threshold-based approaches have been previously used in
order to detect incidents, with and without the aid of a CBR
system. However, using simple thresholds may not provide
suﬃcient knowledge about the event, and would fail in case
of hybrid events, that appear similar to more than one inci-
dent [1, 4]. To cope with these issues, we have designed our
reasoner by adopting a multi-layer approach that builds on
Fuzzy Logic and on ad hoc-case Fuzzy Ranking. Fuzzy-logic
handles situations where no-crisp answers can be found, for
example by determining to what degree an incident is re-
lated to a known case. In addition, it allows us to reason on
the overall similarity of events labeled with a same case. Be-
side fuzzy-based analysis, we compare selected and weighted
features of relevant cases for any potential new input, so as
to check for information that is most indicative of a case,
and therefore discern the nature of the incident.
1. Rank candidate cases. We calculate the member-
ship degree m of the current incident inc for each case mod-
eled in the KB, by measuring absolute distances among each
feature f characterizing inc and the ones proﬁling a case c,
or previously registered instance inst of c. The membership
degree of inc for c is computed as follows:
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
