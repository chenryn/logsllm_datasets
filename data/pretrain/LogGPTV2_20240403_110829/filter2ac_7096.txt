### Title: Black Hat USA 2022: Dive Into Apple IO80211Family Vol. 2

At the Black Hat USA 2020 conference, I presented a topic [1] on the Apple IO80211Family, which covered the architecture, attack surfaces, and numerous kernel vulnerabilities in the Apple 802.11 Wi-Fi kernel extensions. Over the past one and a half years, there have been significant developments in this area. Hereâ€™s an update on the key changes:

1. **Ongoing Vulnerability Landscape**: New kernel vulnerabilities and attack surfaces continue to emerge, while older bugs are being fixed. This is an ongoing and dynamic process.
2. **IO80211Skywalk Subsystems**: These subsystems are becoming increasingly important, with some components even being open-sourced since XNU-8019.80.24. As security researchers, it is crucial to stay updated with the latest background knowledge and fuzzing frameworks.
3. **Refactoring of IO80211Family**: The IO80211Family subsystem has undergone another refactoring, and the version number in the name "IO80211FamilyV2" has been removed. However, the changes are more extensive than just the name.

During my research, I encountered a new challenge: the attack surfaces of the 802.11 Wi-Fi subsystem are widely distributed across the operating system. These include user-mode daemons, the network protocol stack, and various kernel extensions such as IO80211Family.kext, IONetworkingFamily.kext, AppleBCMWLANCoreMac.kext, and IOSkywalkFamily.kext. To address this, I developed a new 802.11 Wi-Fi fuzzing system that integrates these components and ensures they work together seamlessly.

As part of the output from this system, I will share over a dozen zero-day kernel vulnerabilities. Through these new cases, this presentation aims to provide a deeper understanding of the design of the Apple 802.11 Wi-Fi subsystem and the security challenges it faces.
