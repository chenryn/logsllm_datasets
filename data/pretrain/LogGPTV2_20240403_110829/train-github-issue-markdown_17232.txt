The `let` and `var` keywords in JavaScript are not being properly colorized when they are part of a longer word or parameter within a function. This issue can be observed in the following code snippet:

```javascript
fcamelCase = function(all, letter, lettuce, constest) {
    var variance = letter.toUpperCase();
    return variance;
};
```

In this example, the `var` keyword is not highlighted correctly. This problem affects the latest Alpha build (0.10.12-alpha).

For reference, please see the attached screenshot:

This issue needs to be addressed to ensure proper syntax highlighting and improve the readability of the code.
