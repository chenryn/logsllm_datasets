### Summary of Experiments
Summarizing the results from all use cases, we observe that hybrid protocols consisting of A+Y achieve very efficient runtime in the LAN deployment, whereas Y is often the fastest protocol in the WAN deployment. The GMW protocol (B) has rarely been identified to achieve optimal performance.
