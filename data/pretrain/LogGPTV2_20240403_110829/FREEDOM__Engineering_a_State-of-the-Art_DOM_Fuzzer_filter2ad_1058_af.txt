Table 5: The reported bugs found by FreeDom in Apple Safari (WebKit), Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. We mark out
the latest browser versions that are affected by the bugs. The Component column indicates what specific DOM components a
document is required to contain for triggering the bugs. In particular, bugs #18, #19, and #24 only affect the beta version and
are never shipped into a release; though they are security bugs, there are no CVEs assigned for them.

D TESTCASE COMPLEXITY OF FREEDOM
AND DOMATO
To have a fair comparison between FreeDom and Domato (see §6.2.2), we use the
original Domato and configure FreeDom to make a random document generated by
both fuzzers generally have:
• a tree of 60 HTML and SVG elements on average;
• 50 CSS rules, each of which has two selectors on average and 20 CSS properties;
• five event handlers besides main(). main() has 1,000 lines of DOM API calls,
while every other event handler only has 500. Every event handler installs a
counter check at the beginning to ensure that it is never executed for more
than two times.

Figure 10: The PoC snippet of a bug in WebKit found by
FreeDom.
In Figure 10, we list the PoC of a crash found by FreeDom that has various context-
dependent values (CDVs) and is thus missed by Domato in our evaluation. The PoC
includes (1) #v22 at Line 3, which is CDV1, (2) -webkit-filter: url(#v21) at Line 4,
which is CDV2, and (3) attributeName="preserveAspectRatio" at Line 15, which is
CDV3.
A DOM ENGINE BUGS FOUND BY FREEDOM
Table 5 presents the description of the bugs discovered by FreeDom in the DOM
engines of three known web browsers (i.e., Apple Safari, Google Chrome and Mozilla
Firefox).
B THE GENERATION ENGINE OF DOMATO
Figure 8 serves as an examples of how Domato generates HTML documents based
on its grammar. Basically, the listed grammar rules are essential for generating the
CSS rules, JavaScript code, and initial DOM tree below. Note that the demonstrated
document is incomplete. The CSS rule originally owns more CSS properties. And both
the  and  are supposed to have more attributes and children.
