Question: Consider an Android environment where two applications, App A and App B, are installed. App A has a unique user ID, while App B is designed with a 'sharedUserId' attribute in its AndroidManifest.xml file, set to the same user ID as App C, which is also installed on the device. Assuming all three apps are signed with different certificates, which of the following statements is true regarding the access permissions between these applications?
"A": "App A and App B can access each other's data directories because they are installed on the same device.",
"B": "App B and App C can access each other's data directories because they have the same user ID specified in their manifests.",
"C": "App B cannot access App C's data directory despite having the same user ID because they are signed with different certificates.",
"D": "App A can access both App B's and App C's data directories because it has a unique user ID."
Answer: C
