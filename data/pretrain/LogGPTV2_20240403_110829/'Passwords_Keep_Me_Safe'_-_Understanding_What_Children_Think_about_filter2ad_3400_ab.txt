For  categorical  variables,  Chi-Square  tests  of  association 
were used, with effect size calculated using Cramer's V. For 
measured variables with interval levels, data were first tested 
for normality. Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test to 
compare  two  groups)  were  applied  as  the  data  were  not 
normally  distributed.  Post-hoc comparisons  were  used  to 
compare groups: ES vs. MS, MS vs. HS, and ES vs. HS while 
applying the Holm-Bonferroni method to control the family-
wise error rate [19] with adjusted α = 0.017.  
Qualitative responses to the open-ended question “Why do 
you think people should use passwords?” were coded using 
a two-cycle coding process [36]. In the first cycle, inductive 
thematic  and  in  vivo  coding  were  used  separately  by  two 
members  of  the  research  team,  and  then  discussed  and 
merged into one set of codes and sub-codes. We calculated 
intercoder reliability for the initial coding of the data using 
the  ReCal22  software,  the  Krippendorf’s  Alpha  score  was 
0.968. Second cycle pattern coding was used to condense the 
larger code deck into major themes, and returned three final 
thematic codes–access, privacy, and safety–that were applied 
to all of the data [36]. A third, qualitatively trained researcher 
was  then  brought  in  to  independently  conduct  the  same 
inductive  two-cycle  coding  process  to  further  validate 
results, and to advise on qualitative thematic consolidation 
and discussion. The third coder returned four themes: safety, 
privacy, offensive and defensive access, and protection. The 
new theme “protection” was discussed by the research team 
and also applied to the data.  
The third researcher also performed a single-cycle deductive 
thematic  coding  of  the  responses  to  the  second  open-
response  survey  question  asking  participants  to  create  a 
password.  The  themes  for  the  deductive  coding–perceived 
personal information, number or word-only, alphanumeric,  
and strong/weak–were derived from the afore cited literature 
in order to check the validity of collected data with currently 
existing 
theories  and  research  surrounding  children’s 
password creation behavior. 
Any  quotes  provided  within  this  paper  as  exemplars  are

4  Results 
As  indicated  in  section  3.4,  the  significance  level  of 
statistical analyses was set at α = 0.05 and adjusted α = 0.017. 
The  asterisk  symbol  “*”  is  used  to  indicate  statistical 
significance (p < α). 
4.1  Current Usage 
To understand our participants’ current usage of computing 
devices, we collected data on the types of devices as well as 
activities performed with those devices. The percentages of 
computing device usage are summarized in Table 2. When 
comparing among ES, MS, and HS, the MS reported using 
laptop the least, followed by ES, then HS (χ2 =	43.83, df = 2). 
HS (χ2 =	46.17, df = 2), whereas cell phone usage increases 
significantly from ES to MS, to HS (χ2 =	180.65, df = 2). 
The use of tablets decreases significantly from ES to MS, to

Password Understandings 
4.2 
Students  reported  learning  about  good  password  practice 
mainly  from  home  (72.35%)  and  school  (59.90%)  as 
opposed  to  learning  from  internet  (24.48%)  and  friends 
(12.28%).  
4.2.1  Why Passwords? 
Students were asked “Why do you think people should use 
passwords?” ES were asked to provide one reason while MS 
and HS were asked to provide up to three reasons. 
As mentioned previously, the responses were coded using a 
two-cycle 
thematic  process.  There  were  7  primary 
codes/sub-codes and 20 in vivo operationalization terms for 
those  codes,  such  as  “security.”  The  final  code  book  of 
primary  codes,  sub-codes,  and  in  vivo  terms  is  shown  in

The percentages of responses in each primary and sub-code 
are shown in Table 5. As shown in Table 5, for ES, Access 
was the most frequently provided reason for passwords for 
ES,  followed  by  Safety.  The  ES’  responses  included  both 
preventing access and providing access. Response examples 
were “To keep people out of their stuff” (P745, 3rd) and “They 
should use it because the computer needs to know who they 
are”  (P623,  5th).  Representative  examples  for  Safety 
included “To keep us safe” (P1131, 4th), “To keep their stuff 
safe” (P722, 5th) and “... because someone might track you 
down” (P691, 3rd). Almost all MS cited Access, but Privacy 
was  the  second  most  common  response.  Exemplar  MS’ 
responses include Access: “To lock up everything”(P2652, 
7th) and “So people don’t login and be nos[e]y” (P1665, 8th); 
Privacy: “To keep their information private” (P2909, 6th) and 
“To  keep  stuff  private”  (P2918,  8th).  HS  were  focused  on 
Privacy followed by Access. Representative HS’ responses 
include:  Privacy:  “Keep  things  private”  (P1768,  10th)  and 
“To keep privacy” (P2596, 12th); Access:  “So no one will get 
in your stuff”(P2007, 9th) and “To keep unwanted people off 
your device” (P1392, 11th).

Protection, Security, Hacking, and Steal are the remaining 
codes/sub-codes.  Protection  was  cited  more  frequently  by 
HS and MS than ES. Examples include: “To be protected” 
(P2893,  6th)  and  “To  protect  information”  (P2719,  12th). 
Security was reported more by HS than MS and ES. Example 
responses include: “Security reasons” (P244, 9th) or “Keep 
info  secure”  (P1319,  12th).  Hacking  was  mentioned  more 
frequently  by  MS,  for  example,  “to  make  it  harder  to  get 
hacked”  (P1433,  6th).  Steal  received  the  fewest  responses 
across  all  three  age  groups  (13  %  and  below).  Responses 
such as “So people won’t steal your account” (P2968, 8th) 
and  “if  someone  steals  your  phone”  (P2940,  7th)  were 
common themes in the Steal coded data.

ES  found  it  significantly  easier  to  remember  passwords, 
enter passwords (more than 75%) with keyboard or on touch

ES  to  their  older  counterparts.  Entering  password  with 
keyboard becomes significantly easier from ES, to MS, then
