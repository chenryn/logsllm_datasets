Hello Julia-ers!
When adding remote workers with `addprocs()`, I would really love to be able
to send my current working environment along for the new Julia workers.
Currently this does not happen for workers added using an `SSHManager`, though
local workers do seem to inherit the same environment.
After browsing the repo, I think that this behavior could (gulp) easily be
added by extending the code in managers.jl to set all, or some specified
subset, of the current environment variables in the same way that
`JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT` is set. Of course that might not be the default
behavior, but maybe an option? Maybe something like (but not identical to):
        # the default worker timeout
        tval = haskey(ENV, "JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT") ?
            `export JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT=$(ENV["JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT"])\;` : ``
        envvals = map(key->`export $(key)=$(ENV[key])\;`, keys(ENV))
        # Julia process with passed in command line flag arguments
        cmd = `cd $dir '&&' $tval $envvals $exename $exeflags`
Is this a reasonable thing to propose? Please let me know if this is a
terrible idea! Otherwise I will be happy to attempt to implement this. I just
wanted to float the idea here first.
Thanks!
