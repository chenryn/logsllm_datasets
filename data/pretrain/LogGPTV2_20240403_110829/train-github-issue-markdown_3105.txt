Hello Julia Community,

I hope this message finds you well. I have a feature request that I believe could enhance the functionality of `addprocs()` when adding remote workers, particularly those managed via `SSHManager`.

Currently, when using `addprocs()`, local workers seem to inherit the current working environment, but remote workers do not. I would like to propose an enhancement that allows the current working environment to be passed along to the new Julia workers, similar to how `JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT` is set.

After reviewing the repository, it seems that this behavior could be added by extending the code in `managers.jl`. Specifically, we could set all or a specified subset of the current environment variables in the same way that `JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT` is handled. This could be an optional feature, perhaps with a configuration flag.

Here's a rough sketch of how this might look:

```julia
# Set the default worker timeout
tval = haskey(ENV, "JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT") ? `export JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT=$(ENV["JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT"])\;` : ``

# Export all or a subset of the current environment variables
envvals = map(key -> `export $(key)=$(ENV[key])\;`, keys(ENV))

# Construct the command for the Julia process with the passed-in command-line flags
cmd = `cd $dir '&&' $tval $envvals $exename $exeflags`
```

Is this a reasonable proposal? I would greatly appreciate your feedback on whether this is a good idea or if there are any potential issues I might be overlooking. If the community agrees that this is a worthwhile addition, I would be happy to work on implementing it.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,
