### Analysis of Alert Flows and Their Classification

#### SNMP Request (Class A)
- **Peak Analysis**: 
  - **p1** is a significant peak, likely due to a change in the interaction configuration at the external source, which also introduced an increase in the constant component of the flow.
  - **p2** and **p4** are smaller peaks, while **p3** and **p5** are drops, possibly caused by connectivity issues. The overall alert flow is otherwise extremely constant.
- **Low-Intensity Activity**:
  - There is low-intensity activity that is almost invisible in the visual representation. This type of activity would be easily lost if alerts were processed manually.
  - If the signature were completely ignored, this low-level activity would be undetectable.
- **Classification**:
  - This alert flow is classified as Class A due to its constant and explainable nature.

#### ICMP PING WhatsupGold Windows (Class C)
- **Trigger Mechanism**:
  - Triggered by ICMP Echo messages with a payload claiming they are created by a performance measurement tool.
  - The source address is external, and the root cause for these alerts is likely out of the operator's control.
- **Flow Characteristics**:
  - The flow has a constant component with a periodic component creating peaks on five workdays but no additional alerts during weekends.
  - These alerts are regular and considered legitimate, originating from the performance measurement tool.
- **Interesting Phenomena**:
  - Shifts in the constant level: **p1**, **p4**, **p6**, and **p7** are drops, while **p2**, **p3**, **p5**, and **p8** are increases in the constant component intensity.
  - Filtering based solely on alert attributes would prevent the operator from seeing these changes.
- **Classification**:
  - This flow is classified as Class C due to its periodic nature and the difficulty in enumerating the anomalies despite knowing the origins of normal behavior.

#### ICMP Destination Unreachable Communication Administratively Prohibited (Class C)
- **Trigger Mechanism**:
  - Reacts to specific ICMP messages generated when a network node, such as a router, drops a packet for administrative reasons.
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Alerts can be caused by backscatter from DDoS attacks, network outages, or routing problems.
  - The erratic profile suggests a combination of multiple causes.
- **Flow Characteristics**:
  - The flow profile does not have much structure, but smoothing with EWMA reveals a weak weekly rhythm.
  - A correlation between network usage and incoming ICMP Destination Unreachable messages is logical and explains the weekly pattern.
- **Classification**:
  - This flow is classified as Class C because the high variability and anomalies cannot be attributed to a small set of root causes.

#### LOCAL-POLICY External Connection from HTTP Server (Class C)
- **Signature Rationale**:
  - Custom signature indicating that a web server should not be on the SYN side of a TCP handshake with external hosts unless, for example, it is infected by a worm.
- **Alert Intensity**:
  - The profile consists of impulses with some periodicity, including peaks following a weekly rhythm and smaller peaks following daily and shorter cycles.
  - Anomalies: **p1** is missing, **p3** is a change in low-level activity, **p2** is an extremely high peak, and **p4** and **p5** are large peaks breaking the normal rhythm.
- **Classification**:
  - This flow is classified as Class C due to the lack of explanations for both normal and anomalous behavior, and the periodic nature of the peaks.

#### ICMP PING speedera (Class B)
- **Trigger Mechanism**:
  - Triggered by ICMP Echo messages carrying a payload claiming the packet originates from a content distribution company's server trying to determine the closest cache.
- **Flow Characteristics**:
  - The number of messages is proportional to the accesses to sites hosted by the company.
  - The flow has a strong periodic component with peaks during working hours and valleys during nighttime and weekends.
- **Anomalies**:
  - **p1** is a peak during high activity hours, and **p2** is a peak during low activity periods, likely caused by an increase in legitimate traffic.
- **Classification**:
  - This flow is classified as Class B because it is highly periodic, and both normal behavior and anomalies can be explained.

### Conclusions
- Large amounts of alerts are often background noise generated by prolific signatures reacting to the normal functioning of the system, falling into category four of the noise source classes.
- Interesting phenomena in these flows include changes in the intensity generated by normal system behavior or root causes, and the appearance of abnormal sources.
- Flow-level filtering is necessary since alert-by-alert filtering generally loses the intermittent activity and without any filtering, anomalies risk being lost in the noise.
- Four out of five signatures trigger alerts almost continuously, making manual analysis tedious and resource-intensive.

### Methodology for Alert Flow Modeling and Filtering
#### Overview
- **Alert Flow Definition**:
  - An alert flow is a stream of successive alerts meeting aggregation criteria, aggregated by the signature that generated the alert.
  - The objective is to filter out components corresponding to normal activity.
- **Time Series Model**:
  - The alert series \( S_t \) is modeled as \( S_t = X_t + E_t \), where \( X_t \) represents normal activity and \( E_t \) represents abnormal activity.
- **Decomposition Model**:
  - A time series \( X_t \) can be decomposed into trend (\( T_t \)), periodic (\( P_t \)), and random (\( R_t \)) components.
- **Filtering Process**:
  - Transform data to a time series, remove trend and periodic components, and model the random component to identify significant anomalies.

#### Removing the Trend
- **Assumption**:
  - The trend \( T_t \) in the alert flow is assumed to be linear.
- **Reasoning**:
  - Higher-degree trends indicate serious sensor issues or storage capacity problems.
