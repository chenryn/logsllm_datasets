  * run latest Windows 10
  * pin either electron or atom to the taskbar
  * click it to open the app
=> you end up having 2 icons  
=> somehow the app when started does not get associated to the pinned entry in
the taskbar  
=> it does not reproduce on Windows 8.x
I wonder if your change in `fb6c80d` could have an impact here. Imho it is
used to find out if an application belongs to the same process group or not:
