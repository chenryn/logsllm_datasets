It is important to address concerns you believe may arise upfront. Our
colleague and friend Willie Rademaker has a famous saying, "Always
throw the fish on the table". In other words, avoid having surprises when
a project is being scoped. If you believe there might be a point of
contention, address it head on. Surprises are for birthdays…not business.

Penetration Test Executive Report
Kali reporting tools
Kali Linux includes a small selection of reporting tools that can be used for
organizing how a team captures information, as well as some encryption utilities.
Here is a brief overview of some of the tools that could benefit your Penetration
testing practice.
Dradis
Dradis is an open source framework for information sharing. Dradis provides a
centralized repository of information to keep track of what has been done and
still needs to be completed. Dradis can collect information from team members,
provide tools such as Nessus and Qualis, as well as importing information such as
vulnerability lists.
To open Dradis, navigate to Reporting Tools | Documentation and select Dradis.
Dradis is accessed using a standard Internet browser, simplifying collaboration
between groups of people. To start a session, select New Project for the Meta-Server
and provide a password that will be shared between team members.
To login, create a name and provide a password. This will put you in the main
dashboard. Check out the wizards and demo videos to learn more about using
Dradis in your services.

KeepNote
KeepNote is a note-taking application. You can store many note types and quickly
view everything using a notebook hierarchy with rich text and image formatting.
KeepNote can be found under Reporting Tools | Documentation and selecting
KeepNote.
Maltego CaseFile
CaseFile is a visual intelligence application used to determine the relationships and
real world links between hundreds of different types of information. This makes
information gathering and analyzing relationships easy for investigations.
MagicTree
MagicTree is a Penetration Tester productivity tool designed for data consolidation,
querying, external command execution, and report generation. Information is stored
in a tree structure, making it easy to identify results from previous exercises and
format for reporting purposes.

Executive Summary
1.1 Summary
CUSTOMER has assigned the task of carrying out Quarterly Penetration Testing of
, to SERVICE PROVIDER.
This Penetration Test was performed during . The detailed report about each
task and our findings are described as follows.
The purpose of the test is to determine security vulnerabilities in the configurations
and web applications running on the servers specified as part of the scope of work.
The tests are carried out assuming the identity of an attacker or a user with malicious
intent.
1.1.1 Approach
• Perform broad scans to identify potential areas of exposure and services that
may act as entry points.
• Perform targeted scans and investigation to validate vulnerabilities found
from targets identified during broad scans.
[ 303 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Penetration Test Executive Report
• Test identified components to gain access.
• Identify and validate vulnerabilities.
• Rank vulnerabilities based on threat level, loss potential, and likelihood of
exploitation.
• Perform research and development activities to support analysis. Identify
issues of immediate consequence and recommend solutions.
• Provide recommendations to enhance security.
• Transfer knowledge.
During the network level security checks, we attempted to probe ports present on
various servers and detect services running with the existing security holes, if any.
At the web application level, we checked the web servers' configuration and logical
errors in the web application itself.
1.2 Scope
The scope of this Penetration Test was limited to the following IP addresses.
1.3 Key findings

1.4 Recommendations
[ 304 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 8
SERVICE PROVIDER recommends CUSTOMER develop a plan of action to address
problems discovered during this assessment.
Recommendations in this report are classified as tactical or strategic. Tactical
recommendations are short term fixes to help elevate the immediate security
concerns. Strategic recommendations focus on the overall environment, future
directions, and introduction of security best practices. A highlight of the
recommendations follows:
1.4.1 Tactical Recommendations
• Recommendation 1
• Recommendation 2
• Recommendation 3
• Recommendation 4
• Recommendation 5
1.4.2 Strategic Recommendations
• Proactive security assessments: As part of security best practices;
CUSTOMER should ensure that any major changes to their Internet
facing infrastructure have another external security assessment. This is a
precautionary to the impact from changes made as recommended from this
document.
• Intrusion Detection / Prevention (IDS/IPS): Networks exposed to
potentially hostile traffic should implement some capability to detect
intrusions. Investigate an IDS solution for the network.
• Automated network access control: Best practice is automating the control of
whom and what is permitted specific network access.

Experience has shown that a focused effort to address the problems outlined in this
report can result in dramatic security improvements. Most of the identified problems
require knowledge of and commitment to good practices rather than high-level
technical skillsets.

Executive Summary
SERVICE PROVIDER has been contracted to conduct a Penetration Test against
CUSTOMER's external web presence. The assessment was conducted in a manner
that simulated a malicious actor engaged in a targeted attack against the company
with the goals as follows:
• Identifying if a remote attacker could penetrate CUSTOMER's defenses
• Determining the impact of a security breach on:
° The integrity of the company's security
° The confidentiality of the company's information
° The internal infrastructure and availability of CUSTOMER's
information systems
The results of this assessment will be used by CUSTOMER to drive future decisions
as to the direction of their information security program. All tests and actions were
conducted under controlled conditions.
Summary of results
[ 308 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 8
Network Reconnaissance was conducted against the address space provided by
CUSTOMER with the understanding that this range of targets would be considered
the scope for this engagement. It was determined that the company maintains a
minimal external presence, consisting of an external web site and other services
identified by SERVICE PROVIDER during Reconnaissance of CUSTOMER.
While reviewing the security of the primary CUSTOMER website, it was discovered
that a vulnerable plugin was installed. This plugin was successfully exploited,
leading to administrative access. This access was utilized to obtain interactive access
to the underlying operating system, and then escalated to root privileges.
SERVICE PROVIDER was able to use administrative access was to identify internal
network resources. A vulnerability in an internal system was leveraged to gain local
system access, which was then escalated to domain administrator rights. This placed
the entire infrastructure of the network under the control of the attackers.
Attack Narrative
Conclusion
In the course of the external Penetration Test, CUSTOMER suffered a cascading
series of breaches that led to conditions that would directly harm the company as
well as its customers.
The specific goals of the Penetration Test were stated as follows:
• Identify if it is possible for a remote attacker to penetrate CUSTOMER's cyber
defenses
• Determine the impact of a security breach on:
° The integrity of the company's systems.
° The confidentiality of the company's customer information.
° The internal infrastructure and availability of customer's information
systems.
