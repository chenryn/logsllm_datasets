User: In the network environment, what is a DDoS attack? Please list some strategies for defending against DDoS attacks.
Assistant: DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is an attack method that consumes its resources by sending a large amount of communication traffic or connection requests to the target server or network so that it cannot provide services normally. Attacks can come from multiple attack sources, making them more difficult to identify and counter. The following are some strategies for defending against DDoS attacks: 1. Firewall: Use a firewall to filter out some malicious traffic and block connection requests from some specific sources. 2. Load balancing: The traffic is distributed to multiple servers through load balancing technology, which can share the attack traffic. 3. Network bandwidth management: Equipped with sufficient network bandwidth and traffic management system can avoid system paralysis caused by excessive traffic. 4. Cloud protection: Use cloud defense services to quickly filter out most DDoS attack traffic and IP addresses. 5. DNS protection: Using professional DNS resolution and caching services can effectively prevent DNS attacks and avoid target server paralysis. 6. DDos high-availability network architecture: Designing a network architecture that withstands DDos attacks can maintain normal traffic requests and maintain system availability. 7. IDS and IPS: Intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems are effective for detecting and blocking attacks with large volumes of traffic in real time.
