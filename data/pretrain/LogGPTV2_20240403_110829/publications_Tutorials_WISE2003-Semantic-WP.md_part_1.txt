Our Focus (1)
 Web services and their composition into Web Processes promise to
power eCommerce and eServices
 Supporting Web Processes on multi-enterprise and Web scale require
addressing heterogeneity/integration, scalability, dynamic change and
performance challenges
 Semantics is seen as the key enabler to address these challenges;
Semantic Web Processes build upon Web Services and Semantic Web
technologies
 This tutorial is about adding semantics to Web Services, and exploiting
them in Web Process Lifecycle (Specification, Discovery, Composition,
Execution)
 Functional perspective takes form of process composition involving
Web Service Discovery, addressing semantic heterogeneity handling
 Operational perspective takes form of the research on QoS
Specification for Web Services and Processes.

Web Services: Definition
Web Services
“Web services are a new breed of Web application.
They are self-contained, self-describing, modular
applications that can be published, located, and
invoked across the Web. Web services perform
functions, which can be anything from simple requests
to complicated business processes. …
Once a Web service is deployed, other applications
(and other Web services) can discover and invoke the
deployed service.”

What are Web Processes (1)?
 Web Processes are next generation workflow
technology to facilitate the interaction of
organizations with markets, competitors, suppliers,
customers etc. supporting enterprise-level and core
business activities
 encompass the ideas of both intra and inter organizational
workflow.
 created from the composition of Web services
When all the tasks involved in a Web process are
semantically described, we may call such process as
Semantic Web Processes

What are Web Processes ? (2)
Web Processes
Web processes describe how Web services are
connected to create reliable and dependable
business solutions
Web processes allow businesses to describe
sophisticated processes that can both consume
and provide Web services
The role of Web processes within the enterprise is
to simplify the integration of business and
application processes across technological and
corporate domains

BIG Challenges
 Heterogeneity and Autonomy
 Syntactic, semantic and pragmatic
 Complex rules/regulations related to B2B and e-
commerce interactions
 Solution: Machine processable descriptions
 Dynamic nature of business interactions
 Demands: Efficient Discovery, Composition, etc.
 Scalability (Enterprises → Web)
 Needs: Automated service discovery/selection and
composition
Proposition: Semantics is the most important
enabler to address these challenges

What are Semantics and
Ontologies?
Temporal-Entity
Time-Point{absolute_time}
Time Domain
{year, month, day} Date Time {hour, minute, second}
Event
Calendar-Date
{dayOftheWeek, monthOftheYear}
Scientific-Event{millisecond}
 An ontology includes a vocabulary of terms, and
some specification of their meaning.
 The goal is to create an agreed-upon vocabulary
and semantic structure for exchanging information
about that domain.

Semantics for Web Processes
 Data/Information Semantics
 What: Formal definition of data in input and output messages of a web service
 Why: for discovery and interoperability
 How: by annotating input/output data of web services using ontologies
 Functional/Operational Semantics
 Formally representing capabilities of web service
 for discovery and composition of Web Services
 by annotating operations of Web Services as well as provide preconditions and effects; Annotating
TPA/SLA (future work)
 Execution Semantics
 Formally representing the execution or flow of a services in a process or operations in a service
 for analysis (verification), validation (simulation) and execution (exception handling) of the process
models
 using State Machines, Petri nets, activity diagrams etc.
 QoS Semantics
 Formally describing operational metrics of a web service/process
 To select the most suitable service to carry out an activity in a process
 using QoS model [Cardoso and Sheth, 2002] for web services

SOAP
 WSDL defines services as
XML
collections of network endpoints or
ports. A port is defined by
associating a network address
with a binding; a collection of ports
define a service.
 SOAP is a message layout specification that defines
a uniform way of passing XML-encoded data. It also
defines a way to bind to HTTP as the underlying
communication protocol. SOAP is basically a
technology to allow for “RPC over the web”.
 XML was designed to describe data and to focus on
what data is.

Semantic Annotation of Web
Services
Annotation of Web Services
 To enhance the discovery, composition, and
orchestration of Web services, it is necessary to increase
the description of their interfaces.
 One solution is to annotate WSDL interfaces with
semantic metadata based on relevant ontologies.
An ontology is a specification of a representational vocabulary
for a shared domain of discourse.
