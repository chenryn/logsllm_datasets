Hi,
**VS** : 2015 CTP 5  
**TS** : 1.4
In the snapshot below, we are at the point of assigning an inline function to
property `foo`:

The intention is to write something like
    x.foo = bar => bar.toString();
Clearly, the provided completion list is not very helpful here.
Furthermore, when the letter `b` is typed intellisense shows an already
**_selected** _ item in the list of completions. By this I mean the item
`blur` is highlighted with a background colour. This provides a misleading
impression that an exact match has been identified by the intellisense engine,
providing a (false) incentive for the user to hit tab in order to complete the
term.
I believe the more correct behaviour here is to
  * not show intellisense at all unless a type compatible with `x.foo` exists, or
  * only show an outline, similar to the one below:
