User: How do I change the default Python version used in my Mac Snow Leopard? I'm trying to switch from v2.5 to v3.0
Assistant: I would first install Xcode on my machine (it comes on the installation disc that came with your computer). Then run Software Update to bring it up to date (at least to the most-current free version).
Then, download the Python 3.x source code and extract it.  Do "./configure", "make" and "sudo make install" in that directory.  These will install the new Python installation in /usr/local/bin (and other nearby places).
If all goes well, /usr/local/bin/python will be a Python 3 interpreter you can use.  I would hesitate to overwrite the installed version of Python, since that might make trouble for python scripts shipped with the operating system.  I never install anything in /usr; I let Software Update take care of that.  For all the rest of my software needs, the "./configure ... make ... sudo make install" technique works very well on Snow Leopard once Xcode is installed.
