To change the default Python version on your Mac Snow Leopard from 2.5 to 3.0, follow these steps:

1. **Install Xcode:**
   - Insert the installation disc that came with your Mac and install Xcode.
   - Alternatively, you can download Xcode from the Mac App Store or Apple Developer website.

2. **Update Your System:**
   - Run Software Update to ensure your system is up to date. This will help avoid any compatibility issues.

3. **Download Python 3.0:**
   - Download the source code for Python 3.0 from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/source/).

4. **Extract and Install Python 3.0:**
   - Extract the downloaded source code.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted directory.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```sh
     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install
     ```
   - These commands will compile and install Python 3.0 in `/usr/local/bin`.

5. **Verify the Installation:**
   - After the installation, you can verify that Python 3.0 is installed by running:
     ```sh
     /usr/local/bin/python3 --version
     ```
   - This should display the version of Python 3.0.

6. **Update the Default Python Version:**
   - To use Python 3.0 as the default version, you can create a symbolic link:
     ```sh
     sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
     ```
   - This will point `python` to the newly installed Python 3.0.

7. **Avoid Overwriting the System Python:**
   - It is generally not recommended to overwrite the system-installed Python (usually located in `/usr/bin`). The system relies on this version for various scripts and utilities. By installing Python 3.0 in `/usr/local/bin`, you avoid potential conflicts.

8. **Manage Multiple Python Versions:**
   - If you need to switch between different Python versions frequently, consider using a version manager like `pyenv`. You can install it via Homebrew:
     ```sh
     brew install pyenv
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully switch to Python 3.0 on your Mac Snow Leopard while keeping the system's default Python version intact.
