Abstract
Many anti-phishing mechanisms currently focus on help-
ing users verify whether a web site is genuine. However,
usability studies have demonstrated that prevention-based
approaches alone fail to effectively suppress phishing at-
tacks and protect Internet users from revealing their cre-
dentials to phishing sites. In this paper, instead of prevent-
ing human users from “biting the bait”, we propose a new
approach to protect against phishing attacks with “bogus
bites”. We develop BogusBiter, a unique client-side anti-
phishing tool, which transparently feeds a relatively large
number of bogus credentials into a suspected phishing site.
BogusBiter conceals a victim’s real credential among bogus
credentials, and moreover, it enables a legitimate web site
to identify stolen credentials in a timely manner. Leveraging
the power of client-side automatic phishing detection tech-
niques, BogusBiter is complementary to existing preventive
anti-phishing approaches. We implement BogusBiter as an
extension to Firefox 2 web browser, and evaluate its efﬁcacy
through real experiments on both phishing and legitimate
web sites.
1. Introduction
A phishing attack is typically carried out using an email
or an instant message, in an attempt to lure recipients to
a fake web site to disclose personal credentials. To defend
against phishing attacks, a number of countermeasures have
been proposed and developed. Server-side defenses employ
SSL certiﬁcates, user selected site-images, and other secu-
rity indicators to help users verify the legitimacy of web
sites. Client-side defenses equip web browsers with auto-
matic phishing detection features or add-ons to warn users
away from suspected phishing sites. However, recent us-
ability studies have demonstrated that neither server-side
security indicators nor client-side toolbars and warnings are
successful in preventing vulnerable users from being de-
ceived [6, 21, 23, 26, 28]. This is mainly because (1) phish-
ers can convincingly imitate the appearance of legitimate
web sites, (2) users tend to ignore security indicators or
warnings, and (3) users do not necessarily interpret secu-
rity cues appropriately. Educational defenses [12, 16, 24]
and takedown defenses [13, 18, 39] have also been studied.
However, these defenses cannot completely foil phishing at-
tacks and will take a long time to be effective on a large
scale.
These different approaches are all preventive by nature.
They endeavor to prevent users from being tricked into re-
vealing their credentials to phishing sites. Nevertheless,
these prevention-based approaches alone are insufﬁcient to
shield vulnerable users from “biting the bait” and defeat
phishers, as human users are the weakest link in the secu-
rity chain. The ever-increasing prevalence and severity of
phishing attacks clearly indicate that anti-phishing is still a
daunting challenge.
In response to this challenge, we have made two observa-
tions with respect to the acquisition of credentials by phish-
ers and the automatic detection of phishing attacks on web
browsers. First, currently the majority of those who have
“bitten the bait” and fallen victim to phishing attacks are
real victims, thus it is trivial for a phisher to verify the ac-
quired credentials and trade them for money. However, if
we can supply phishing sites with a large number of bo-
gus credentials, we might be able to hide victims’ real cre-
dentials among bogus credentials and make it harder for
phishers to succeed. Second, although remarkable advances
in client-side automatic phishing detection have empow-
ered web browsers to identify the majority of phishing sites
[4, 11, 17, 33, 36, 40], the possible false positives (legiti-
mate web sites misclassiﬁed as phishing sites) make it hard
for web browsers to directly block users’ connections to
suspected phishing sites. Thus, issuing warnings and ex-
pecting users to leave a suspected phishing site have be-
come the most common actions employed by modern web
browsers. However, instead of just wishing vulnerable users
could make correct decisions, if we can effectively trans-
form the power of automatic phishing detection into the
power of automatic fraud protection, we will take a big step
forward towards winning the battle against phishing.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to protect

against phishing attacks with “bogus bites” on the basis of
the two observations mentioned above. The key feature
of this approach is to transparently feed a relatively large
number of bogus credentials into a suspected phishing site,
rather than attempt to prevent vulnerable users from “bit-
ing the bait”. These “bogus bites” conceal victims’ real
credentials among bogus credentials, and enable legitimate
web sites to identify stolen credentials in a timely manner.
Based on the concept of “bogus bites”, we design and de-
velop BogusBiter, a unique client-side anti-phishing tool
that is complementary to existing prevention-based mech-
anisms. Seamlessly integrated with the phishing detection
and warning mechanisms in modern web browsers, Bogus-
Biter is transparent to users.
While leveraging the power of widely used client-side
automatic phishing detection techniques, BogusBiter is not
bound to any speciﬁc phishing detection scheme. Thus, Bo-
gusBiter can utilize the latest advances in phishing detec-
tion techniques such as blacklists and heuristics to protect
against a wide range of phishing attacks. Moreover, Bogus-
Biter is incrementally deployable over the Internet, and the
fraud protection enabled at a legitimate web site is indepen-
dent of the deployment scale of BogusBiter. We implement
BogusBiter as a Firefox web browser extension and evalu-
ate its efﬁcacy through real experiments over both phishing
and legitimate web sites. Our experimental results indicate
that BogusBiter is a promising anti-phishing approach.
2. Background
Figure 1(a) illustrates a phishing site designed to attack
eBay users. In a typical scenario, a user receives a spoofed
email that appears to be sent from the real eBay, luring the
user to log into the phishing site. Once the user believes
this site is the genuine eBay web site and logs in, the user’s
username/password credential is stolen. Passwords have in-
creasingly been targeted by harvesting attacks, as they pro-
tect online accounts with valuable assets [9]. While some
phishing attacks may steal other types of credentials such
as credit card numbers and social security numbers, the
most common type of phishing attack attempts to steal ac-
count numbers and passwords used for online banking [15].
Therefore, protecting a user’s username/password creden-
tial is the primary focus of many client-side anti-phishing
research work such as SpoofGuard [4], Dynamic Security
Skins [5], PwdHash [22], Web Wallet [29], and Passpet
[31]. Our work also focuses on protecting a user’s user-
name/password credential. In the remainder of this paper,
we use the terms credential and username/password pair in-
terchangeably.
While distinct from preventive anti-phishing mecha-
nisms, BogusBiter complements them in a natural way. In
particular, BogusBiter leverages the power of client-side au-
tomatic phishing detection mechanisms and takes advan-
tage of the state-of-practice phishing warning mechanisms
in popular web browsers to transparently protect vulnerable
users.
Among automatic phishing detection mechanisms, two
commonly used techniques are blacklists and heuristics.
Blacklist-based techniques generate close-to-zero false pos-
itives and can detect most phishing attacks [17, 32, 35, 37].
For example, Ludl et al. demonstrated that blacklists pro-
vided by Google (used by Firefox 2) can recognize almost
90% of live phishing sites. However, because some phish-
ing sites may not be added into blacklists and the so-called
zero-day attacks may occur, researchers have proposed var-
ious heuristic-based techniques to identify phishing sites
in real time [4, 11, 17, 33]. These heuristic-based tech-
niques have obtained very encouraging results. For exam-
ple, CANTINA, a content-based detection tool proposed
by Zhang et al. [33] can identify 90% of phishing pages
with only 1% false positives. A URL-based classiﬁer pro-
posed by Garera et al. [11] is another tool which can catch
95.8% of phishing pages with only 1.2% false positives.
Currently, Firefox 2 primarily employs blacklist-based tech-
niques while Internet Explorer (IE) 7 uses both kinds of
techniques [36, 40]. Because BogusBiter’s design is inde-
pendent of any speciﬁc detection scheme, it can leverage
advances in both blacklist-based techniques and heuristic-
based techniques to combat the majority of phishing attacks.
Regarding phishing site warning mechanisms, the state-
of-practice is to make it mandatory for a user to respond
to the warning of a suspected phishing site. Figure 1(b) il-
lustrates the warning given by Firefox 2 [36] after correctly
identifying the example web site in Figure 1(a) as a phishing
site. A user is unable to enter the username and password
without ﬁrst interacting with the warning page. If the user
clicks on the link “Get me out of here!”, the user is redi-
rected to a default page and is protected. Otherwise, if the
user clicks on the link “Ignore this warning”, the warning
page disappears and the user is exposed to the risk of cre-
dential theft. A similar warning mechanism is also used in
IE 7 [40]. Both Firefox 2 and IE 7 might choose such a
strong warning mechanism because: (1) issuing warnings
simply through browser-based security indicators such as
the address bar, the status bar, and various toolbars is inef-
fective [6, 21, 23, 26, 28], and (2) directly blocking users’
connections to suspected phishing sites is unacceptable, due
to inevitable false positives. Although using strong warning
pages represents current best practice, the usability study of
the IE 7 warning page conducted by Schechter et al. [23]
demonstrates that over 50% of participants still ignore the
warning and enter their passwords, despite the overtness of
the warning page and its strong wording. Another usability
study conducted by Egelman et al. [7] shows that over 20%
of participants ignore the strong warnings.

3. Design
In this section, we ﬁrst give an overview on the design of
BogusBiter, and then we detail the offensive line and defen-
sive line of BogusBiter.
3.1. Design Overview
BogusBiter is designed as either a new component or an
extension to popular web browsers such as Firefox 2 or IE 7.
It integrates seamlessly with phishing detection and warn-
ing mechanisms of current web browsers to protect vulner-
able users against phishing attacks.
3.1.1. How It Works. When a login page is classiﬁed as a
phishing page by a browser’s built-in detection component,
BogusBiter is triggered. At this point, BogusBiter will per-
form differently based on a user’s response to the browser’s
phishing warning page. For a vulnerable user who clicks
the “Ignore this warning” link and submits a real creden-
tial, BogusBiter will intercept the victim’s real credential,
hide it among a set of S − 1 generated bogus credentials,
and then submit the S credentials one by one to the phish-
ing site within a few milliseconds. For a security-conscious
user who clicks the “Get me out of here!” link on the warn-
ing page, BogusBiter will generate a set of S bogus creden-
tials, and then feed them one by one into the phishing site in
the same way as it does for a vulnerable user. These actions
are completely transparent to both vulnerable and security-
conscious users.
3.1.2. Design Assumption. We assume that a phisher
does not have a complete list of valid usernames for a tar-
geted legitimate web site, and cannot directly query a tar-
geted legitimate web site for the validity of a speciﬁc user-
name. Although this assumption may not be strictly cor-
rect for email service web sites and community web sites,
it is generally true for ﬁnancial institutions, which are the
main targets of phishing attacks. Financial institutions sel-
dom have valid username lists publicly accessible. Mean-
while, for a failed login attempt, web sites often try to hide
whether the failure is due to an incorrect username or due to
an incorrect password by returning the same error message
[3, 10], making it very hard to test the validity of a given
username. Indeed, preventing the leakage of username va-
lidity information is necessary for protecting user privacy,
guarding users from invasive advertising and phishing, and
defending against password guessing attacks. To enhance
such a protection, the recent work by Bortz et al. [3] rec-
ommends that the response time of HTTP requests should
be carefully controlled by some web sites to remove timing
vulnerabilities. Florˆencio et al. [10] further suggest that in-
creasing username strength could be more beneﬁcial than
merely increasing password strength.
3.1.3. Design Objectives. To be effective, BogusBiter has
two key design objectives:
• offensive objective: BogusBiter should inject as many
bogus credentials as possible into a phishing site, thus
well hide victims’ real credentials among bogus cre-
dentials.
• defensive objective: Given that a phisher is aware of
BogusBiter and is willing to assume the heavy bur-
den of sifting out bogus credentials, BogusBiter should
