The results of the previous sections provide some guidance. We
have already seen that the statistical parser generalizes better across
familiar and unfamiliar TLDs, so that fewer errors will be encoun-
tered. Of the errors that are encountered, we can then compare the
amount of effort required to ﬁx them. For the rule-based parser,
the errors can only be ﬁxed by a human expert who is willing (on
an ongoing basis) to revise the parser’s existing rules or to craft
altogether new ones. For the statistical parser, this manual exer-
cise is not required: once the errors are identiﬁed, the correctly
labeled WHOIS record can be added to the existing training set, and
the model can be enlarged and retrained to work as desired. We
emphasize here that the procedures for feature generation and pa-
rameter estimation in these models are easily automated.
We can make this comparison even more concrete for the results
in Table 2. Note that the rule-based parser made errors in 10 out
of the 12 new TLDs; the statistical parser made errors in just 4 of
them. To ﬁx the errors in the rule-based parser, it would be nec-
essary for a human expert to alter the parser’s rule base, one time
after another, for each of these 10 TLDs. On the other hand, after
retraining the model with just four additional labeled examples the
resulting statistical parser has no errors.
6. SURVEYING .COM
With our parser in hand, we applied it to our crawl of the WHOIS
records of com domains and constructed a database of the ﬁelds ex-
tracted by the parser. The information in the database provides a
convenient global view of domain registrations in the largest TLD,
and in this section we use this global perspective to look at regis-
trations through the lenses of registrants, registrars, and the use of
privacy protection. Since domain information is often used when
examining Internet abuse, we also brieﬂy look at WHOIS features
of com domains found on the DBL blacklist. For the results in
this section, we use 102,077,202 com domains that were created
through the end of 2014.
6.1 Registrants
Where are registrants located? Table 3 shows the top 10 coun-
tries of all domain registrants, with the remaining countries com-
bined in the “Other” row. The left half of the table shows the break-
down for all com domains, and the right half shows the breakdown
for domains created in 2014. Because we have a recent snapshot of
WHOIS records, we will not see domains that were registered in com

years ago and that have expired before our crawl. By also looking at
just the domains registered in the last year, though, we can capture
both recent registration behavior as well as a nearly complete set
of domain registrations for that period (since domains typically are
registered for a minimum of one year). For these results, we have
also removed the 20% of all domains that use a privacy protection
service since the country of the registrant cannot be inferred (we
explore domains using the protection services in more detail be-
low). For WHOIS records that do not have country information for
the registrant, we list these as “Unknown”.
For the WHOIS records with country information, they support
the general reputation of the US dominating registrations in the com
TLD: 47% of all com domains are from US registrants. Many Eu-
ropean countries also have signiﬁcant numbers of registrants, but
those in China are the second most numerous. Indeed, the number
of com registrants in China was nearly half those of the US in 2014,
and far more than any remaining country.
Looking at these temporal trends more broadly, Figure 4a shows
a histogram of the number of domains created in com over time at
the granularity of a year. Figure 4b shows the same data, but nor-
malizes it and breaks down the domains by the ﬁve largest countries
of registrants as well as those using privacy protection services and
registrants with missing country information.
Some general trends emerge. Registrations in com continue to
grow dramatically, and the rate is increasing over time. The frac-
tion of domains registered with privacy protection is also increasing
over time, passing 20% in 2014. While US registrants dominate the
total set of registered com domains, the trends are changing (at least
for domains that report registrant country in their WHOIS records).
The fraction of new domains from US registrants is decreasing over
time, while Chinese registrants are the growth market.
Which organizations have many com domains? For the records
that report organizational information, the types of organizations
that stand out with the most domains are domain sellers (BuyDo-
mains.com, HugeDomains.com, Domain Asset Holdings, etc.), on-
line marketers (Dex Media, Yodle), and Internet hosting companies
in Japan (Sakura Internet, Xserver). Beyond these, Table 4 lists
well-known brand companies that have registered the most com do-
mains. Not surprisingly, they fall into large retail, service, and me-
dia companies.10
10Note that similar company searches using services like Domain-
Tools often return larger counts; such searches match text on the
entire WHOIS record, not just particular com domains as we do.

6.2 Registrars
Table 5 shows the top 10 registrars by number of com domains
registered overall, and for domains created in 2014. GoDaddy is
well known to be a dominant registrar, and indeed we ﬁnd that it
has registered over one-third of com domains. Overall registration
market share is heavily skewed: the top three registrars account for
nearly half of com domains, and the top 10 account for 73%. Re-
ﬂecting the temporal trends in Figure 4b, we see the rise of Chinese
registrars HiChina and Xin Net in the 2014 list corresponding to the
rise in demand from Chinese registrants.
The registrar names evoke their countries of origin. To examine
how registrants are distributed across registrars in more detail, Fig-
ure 5 shows the top three countries of registrants for four of the top
registrars. For the most part, the countries of registrants reﬂect their
registrars: eNom has US, UK, and Canadian registrants, HiChina
has Chinese registrants (the “[]” corresponds to records lacking
country information), and GMO Internet primarily has Japanese
registrants. Interestingly, although Melbourne IT does have Aus-
tralian registrants, US customers dominate its business followed by
Japanese customers.
