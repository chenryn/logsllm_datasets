#### Summary
The theme chooser does not appear to work on my system. I cannot select a
theme.
#### Setup
Ubuntu 15.04 with atom 1.0.0 amd64 freshly installed from .deb package.
#### Observed behaviour
Themes show up in the list of Core Themes and Installed Themes. However, when
I click the drop-down selectors for UI Theme and Syntax Theme, they only show
an empty white box, with 'One Dark' remaining selected.

#### Expected behaviour
I would have expected the names of installed themes to appear in the drop-down
box so that I could select another theme.
#### Notes
Not sure if this is relevant or a separate bug, but searching for themes using
the 'filter themes by name' box does not return any themes.
