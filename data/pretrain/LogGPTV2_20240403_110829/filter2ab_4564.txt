### Title: Botconf 2020 - The Fall of Domino: A Preinstalled Hostile Downloader

**Abstract:**

Android, as an open-source operating system, provides Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and their subcontractors with the flexibility to add various components to the system. While these additions can introduce new and exciting features, they can also sometimes conceal complex malware. This presentation will focus on a malware family known as 'Domino.'

**Overview:**

- **Discovery:** Domino was found preinstalled on certain low-cost Android devices, specifically those running Android 7 or lower.
- **Distribution:** It was distributed as a new operating system component on a small fraction of different phone brands.
- **Infection Mechanism:** The malware author injected additional code into multiple Android components, including the default browser, Settings app, and the Android framework. This allowed Domino to use system privileges to download additional applications and prevent their uninstallation by the user.

**Behavior:**

- **Ad Display:** Different versions of Domino exhibit varying behaviors, such as displaying advertisements.
- **URL Overwriting:** Some versions overwrite visited URLs to change the default search engine or advertisement campaign referral IDs.
- **Browser Exclusivity:** The modifications made by Domino ensured that all links clicked by the user were opened exclusively in the Domino-controlled browser.

**Unique Findings:**

- **Source Code Archive:** We obtained a compressed archive containing Dominoâ€™s source code, complete with code comments and instructions for manufacturers on how to embed Domino on their devices.
- **SELinux Policies:** The archive also includes SELinux policies designed to allow Domino to persist and run with elevated privileges.
- **Test Application:** Additionally, we acquired a test application that interacted with the Google Play store to test referral substitution. This application appears to have been written by the Domino author to experiment with coding ideas.
