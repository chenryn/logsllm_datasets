cedure, in case that the data erasure is initiated by malicious
people. So the user needs to provide identity information for
authentication. When the user reports the theft and the i-
dentity is veriﬁed successfully, the service provider updates
the record of the stolen device in the IMEI database by tag-
ging its state as stolen.
4.4 Remote Wipe-Out
When the SIM card is removed from a smartphone, any
service that uses the IMSI as the subscriber identiﬁcation
cannot be requested by this phone, such as the basic call
service and SMS. However, a smartphone without the SIM
card still could camp on an available network to make an
emergency call, using IMEI as equipment identiﬁcation. So
we use the emergency channel to remotely control a stolen
smartphone.
4.4.1 Deletion Indicator
Once the smartphone detects the absence of the SIM card,
it asks for data erasure through making a customized emer-
gency call with a deletion indicator attached. It will receive
a wipe-out command after the call control entity of the net-
work conﬁrms that the phone has been stolen. The deletion
indicator is attached to an emergency call on the premise
that the signaling procedure of the customized emergency
call is consistent with the normal emergency call originat-
ed by a smartphone as deﬁned in standard protocols. So
the network carriers can support our mechanism without
any change to the current network structure. The deletion
indicator is attached based on minimal modiﬁcation of the
implementation of current protocols. For example, the dele-
tion indicator could be attached by using reserved bits in
certain data ﬁelds to assign customized values.
4.4.2 Phone State Conﬁrmation
Our mechanism guarantees that the data on the phone
will be erased only if the device is indeed stolen.
If the
call control entity receives a request for setting up a cus-
tomized emergency call, it checks the state of the smart-
phone by querying the IMEI number and its state in the
IMEI database of the service provider.
The usage of the IMEI database is similar to the blacklist
of IMEI numbers which is used during the normal call es-
tablishment procedures. The blacklist is an IMEI database
deployed in the mobile cellular network. This list records the
IMEI numbers of the phones reported stolen or whose opera-
tion will adversely aﬀect the network. During any procedure
of establishing a call, the call control entity could check the
IMEI of the phone in the blacklist and determine whether
the device needs to be blocked. Similarly, for a customized
emergency call, the call control entity checks the IMEI num-
ber in the IMEI database of the service provider conﬁrming
the state of the phone, and then decides whether the device
needs to be wiped out.
4.4.3 Wipe-out Command
If the returned state is stolen in the IMEI database, the
call control entity sends a wipe-out command to the device.
The wipe-out command could be formatted through assign-
ing a speciﬁc value for a special data ﬁeld of the call reject
message deﬁned in the current call control protocol. Upon
receiving the wipe-out command, the smartphone initiates
the data erasure.
On the other hand, if the state of the phone is normal, the
network will send a call accepted message to the smartphone
consistent with the access permission for a legal ongoing e-
mergency call originated by a smartphone without the SIM
card. This design aims at keeping the consistency with cur-
rent protocol. The smartphone hangs up the customized
emergency call releasing all occupied resources after receiv-
ing this message.
4.5 Security Analysis
Since the service provider veriﬁes the reporter’s identity
when a smartphone is reported stolen, we can prevent a ma-
licious attacker from misusing our system to falsely wipe
another user’s smartphone. When a user registers the re-
mote wipe-out service, he submits certain identiﬁcation in-
formation that can uniquely identify himself to the service
provider. Furthermore, the service provider may enhance
the authentication process by challenging the reporter who
wants to activate the wipe-out service with certain specif-
ic questions, such as providing one phone number with the
most frequent communication.
We can also prevent the service provider or the network
carrier from accidentally or maliciously wiping out a smart-
phone. The user speciﬁes the PIN code for further authenti-
cation when installing the wipe-out application on his phone.
The user only needs to disclose the PIN code to the service
provider when he wants to activate the wipe-out service.
The service provider should send the PIN code to the cal-
l control entity, if the state of the queried IMEI is stolen.
The smartphone should verify the PIN code when receiving
a wipe-out command from the call control entity. The PIN
code will be deleted during the wipe-out procedure. Users
should choose diﬀerent PIN codes for diﬀerent mobile de-
vices due to the disclosure of one PIN code to the operator
when one device is stolen.
Most anti-theft mobile apps provide two options for user-
s to remotely wipe out a mobile device, factory reset and
security deletion. We test ﬁve popular data recovery apps
to recover the data deleted by resetting. Though those apps
cannot recovery all data, they may recover some data in user
partitions. Since resetting can be easily defeated by adver-
saries, we demand secure deletion instead. Our framework
is ﬂexible to accommodate various secure deletion solutions.
To ensure a completed deletion, secure deletion should not
be interrupted by adversaries, except for power oﬀ or be-
ing out of battery. Even in this case, an unﬁnished secure
deletion procedure will automatically resume at the next
boot until all sensitive data are totally wiped out. Since the
execution of secure deletion is transparent to the user, the
adversary will not be alerted.
5. CASE STUDY
5.1 UMTS Network
UMTS is a third generation mobile cellular system stan-
dard. Smartphone is known as MS (Mobile Station) in
UMTS. The MSC (Mobile Switching Center) is the primary
call control entity in UMTS network, responsible for set-
ting up and releasing the end-to-end connection, handling
mobility and hand-over requirements during the call.
540Figure 2: Emergency Call Establishment Procedure in UMTS Network
The core network of UMTS can be accessed through ei-
ther UTRAN (Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network)
or GERAN (GSM EDGE Radio Access Network). Here
we describe the radio access network of UMTS using Ra-
dio Network Controllers (RNC) and Node B in UTRAN,
which could be substituted by Base Station Control (BSC)
and Base Transceiver Station (BTS) in the GERAN.
Equipment Identity Register (EIR) deployed in the UMT-
S network contains the blacklist of the IMEI numbers asso-
ciated with banned devices. For a normal call, the MSC
could check the IMEI number of the MS in the EIR to de-
cide whether the call needs to be terminated. If the IMEI
of the MS is in the blacklist, the MSC will release all active
connections for this call.
5.2 Emergency Call
The procedure of establishing an emergency call in UMT-
S network is shown in Figure 2, and the bordered words
indicate our customizations. The “CM service request” mes-
sage speciﬁes the requested CM (Connection Management)
service type as an emergency call and the equipment identi-
ﬁcation as the IMEI. If the network supports using IMEI as
identiﬁcation, the request will be accepted and the mobile
station will send an “emergency setup” message to the MSC
asking for the establishment of a call control connection for
the emergency call.
5.3 Deletion Indicator
As stipulated in UMTS speciﬁcation, the information el-
ement “emergency category” of the “emergency setup” mes-
sage indicates the emergency service requested by the MS
[3]. Each emergency number stored on the MS is associated
with a speciﬁc emergency service. The call control entity
routes the emergency call to a related emergency center, ac-
cording to the emergency service category. To customize an
emergency call for our remote wipe-out service, we attach
a deletion indicator to the “emergency setup” message by
assigning a special emergency service category value, indi-
cating the emergency service for data erasure.
The emergency category ﬁeld is deﬁned in UMTS speci-
ﬁcation [3], each bit of this ﬁeld stands for one emergency
case, including police, ambulance, ﬁre brigade etc. Special-

Table 1: Emergency Category
ly, bit 8 is reserved and set to 0. Mobile station may set one
or more bits to 1 to specify an emergency service category.
To distinguish data erasure from any other emergency ser-
vice, we set the reserved bit of emergency service category
value to 1 as shown in Table 1 and specify this value as
“10000000” indicating emergency service for data erasure.
This value can be speciﬁed to any other value with the bit
8 set to 1.
5.4 Wipe-out Command
For a normal emergency call attempt, the MSC sends a
“release” message to the MS with a speciﬁc cause value if
the IMEI of the MS is in the blacklist. The cause informa-
tion element in the “release” message is used to indicate the
reason for the abortion. We customize a cause “Deletion”
through assigning a special cause value.
Upon receipt of the customized “emergency setup” mes-
sage, the MSC initiates the identiﬁcation procedure asking
for equipment identity, and then it queries the responded
IMEI and its state in the IMEI database of the service
provider. If the state of the phone is stolen, the MSC send-
s a “release” message with the cause “Deletion” to the MS
as a wipe-out command. We deﬁne the cause “Deletion”
as 01100111 which is distinguished from all existing cause
values, so as to avoid accidental deletion from misunder-
standing of a “release” message.
6. DISCUSSION
We design a remote deletion mechanism for smartphones,
which will be enabled even though the SIM cards are un-
plugged and the WiFi is disconnected. However, an ad-
versary may keep the smartphone in diﬀerent conditions.

Table 2: Remote Deletion Mechanism
To provide a full-ﬂedged remote wipe-out mechanism, we
suggest implementing several developed remote data erasure
methods together with our framework as shown in Table 2.
For a stolen smartphone with the original SIM card plugged
or replaced by another SIM card, the owner can send a spe-
ciﬁc wipe-out SMS message to the device. Moreover, if the
data service from cellular network or the WiFi connection is
available, the owner can remotely wipe out an online device
through the Internet. In addition, our proposed mechanism
enables remote data erasure on a stolen smartphone when
the SIM card is removed and the WiFi connection is not
available.
The implementation of our prototype on Android platfor-
m is our future work. To support our wipe-out mechanism,
we need to make some modiﬁcations on current procedure
of making an emergency call, involving both the applica-
tion processor and the modem, so that our remote wipe-out
application could make the customized emergency calls and
perform the stealthy dialing automatically. Although our
mechanism needs the support from cellular network carrier-
s, the carriers only need to make some extensions on their
software modules rather than changing their infrastructures.
Some carriers in US have already promised that they would
support a free and secure anti-theft application for Android
devices if and when a manufacturer provides an appropriate
solution [2].
7. CONCLUSION
Smartphones are increasingly used for processing and car-
rying sensitive data, meanwhile become the main targets for
thieves, which poses serious security risk on personal data.
We propose a novel remote data destruction mechanism for
a stolen smartphone when whose SIM card is unplugged and
the WiFi is disabled. The network operators can integrate
our proposed mechanism to provide remote wipe-put ser-
vice for the user without any modiﬁcation on current net-
work structure. Once a smartphone is stolen, its owner can
report the theft and ask for wipe-out.
If the SIM card is
removed by the adversary, the stolen smartphone starts to
request user permission for wipe-out through making cus-
tomized emergency call. We utilize the only communication
channel for remote control in such connection constrained
environment. We present the remote wipe-out mechanis-
m here to encourage further investigation of implementing
remote data deletion on a stolen smartphone.
