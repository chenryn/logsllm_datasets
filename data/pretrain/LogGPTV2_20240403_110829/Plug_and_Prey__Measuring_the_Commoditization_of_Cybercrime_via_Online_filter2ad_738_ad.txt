date. Their operation halted suddenly in July of 2017,
when the FBI together with the Dutch Police shut down
AlphaBay (and Hansa Market, which we do not report on
here). Still, the overall pattern clearly is one of growth.
The trade in cybercrime commodities seems resistant to
the turbulence across marketplaces.
Figure 5 shows that the upward trend in feedback in-
stances is not only caused by an increase in listings, but
also to the increase of amount of feedback per listing. In
2011, a listing on average received around ﬁve pieces of
feedback per month. Over time, this ascended to around
eight pieces of feedback per listing in 2017, with inter-
mediate spikes to over ten pieces of feedback in 2012.
Those spikes coincide with the period of time in which
Silk Road 1 became known by the general public due to
extensive coverage by news and media over the course of
2011 [1]. Conversely, the trough at the end of 2013 is pri-
marily due to the Silk Road 1 takedown and the chaotic
few weeks that ensued [40]. Overall, we see that the av-
erage amount of feedback per listing stabilizes halfway
through 2012 and from that moment onwards seems to
follow a slow rise.
Essential to the understanding of the ecosystem is
identifying which categories can be attributed to most of
the growth in sales and revenue. For each item listing,
revenue is calculated by multiplying each feedback spe-
ciﬁc to a listing with the dollar-price of that listing at the
moment the feedback was generated. The revenue from
these listing is then aggregated per month and per cate-
gory. Figure 6 shows revenue per category. The spikes
and troughs are, again, the result of marketplace turbu-
lence.
The category of cash-out listings is by far the biggest
cybercrime component, in terms of listings, revenue and
vendors. We take a closer look to see whether this rev-

ket ecosystem however – nearing $600,000 per month in
late 2014, mostly generated by drugs [40] – this is just a

enue is driven by a small fraction of listings or whether
it represents a broader volume of trade. It turns out the
a large portion of the increase between 2014 and 2015
is driven by feedbacks on CVV listings. More specif-
ically, one listing offering “US CVVs” received nearly
700 feedbacks in the ﬁrst quarter of 2014. From the
beginning of 2015 onwards we see a steady growth in
revenue alongside the growth of AlphaBay market as a
whole. In the early days of the ecosystem we see an in-
crease in cash-out revenue which was primarily driven
by a listing offering “10,000 USD CASH,” which can be
seen as typical money laundering – the customer pays in
bitcoin and receives cash.

cluding cash-out category
5.2 Vendors over time
Another element in the assessment of commoditization
is the level of vendor competition. Figure 8 shows the
number of vendors per category over time. A vendor is
deﬁned to be active if she has at least one active item
listing and may be instantaneously active in multiple cat-
egories.
Figure 6: Total revenue per category per month
The revenue of cash-out listings is obscuring the other
categories. When we omit it in Figure 7, we see that the
trend of increasing revenue between 2012 and 2017 be-
comes apparent yet again. In the second half of 2014,
listings in e-mail distribution such as spam tutorials,
spam runs or large databases of e-mail addresses gener-
ate very high revenue numbers. Similarly, we see a spike
in botnet-related sales driven by a mysterious listing ti-
tled “source,” receiving 10 – rather negative – feedbacks
in the summer of 2014. The average of $5000 per month
in 2013 grows to $15,000 per month in late 2017. Com-
Figure 8: Number of active vendors per month
As with the revenue per listing, the number of unique
vendors per category is generally increasing over time,
however the increase in vendors is steeper than the in-
crease in listings. Figure 9 clearly shows that the increase
in vendors from 2014 onwards is due the Evolution and
AlphaBay marketplaces. Soska and Christin showed that
in the contemporary ecosystem (i.e., after the Silk Road
take-down), it is common for each vendor to maintain
more than one alias on different marketplaces which may
be partially responsible for this observation.

Figure 11: Percentage of total number of listings per

of listings in each category and then calculate the per-
centage of each category in this log-scaled total count of
listings. There are minor variations visible, but the more
obvious pattern is the similarity between most markets.
All except two markets, namely Hydra and Pandora, con-
tain listings in each of the categories. Hydra and Pandora
are relatively small markets, with a shorter life-span and
the absence of listings in some categories is probably due
their comparatively modest size and short existence. In
terms of commoditization, all categories of the criminal
value chains are consistently offered across markets and
time. Moreover, these components see vendor competi-
tion.
Figure 12: Percentage of total revenue per market per
category (revenue is logged)
Another way to evaluate market specialization is by
categorical revenue. In Figure 12, we show the percent-
age of revenue – after log transformation – per category
of cybercrime component per market. The story is un-
changed:
there are no major differences between mar-
kets. If anything, the picture painted by looking at rev-
enues is even more uniform across marketplaces.
Figure 10: Cumulative distribution function of list-
ings and revenues across vendors
Listings and revenue are not distributed normally
across vendors. As in many markets, there are big play-
ers and small players. Figure 10 plots the cumulative
percentage of listings and revenue of cybercrime compo-
nents over vendors. A small portion of vendors are re-
sponsible for a large fraction of the listings. To be more
precise, around 30% of vendors are responsible for 80%
of all listings. More interestingly, just under 10% of ven-
dors are responsible for generating 80% of the total rev-
enue. That means that around 174 vendors have sold for
nearly $7 million worth of cybercrime components. This
translates into an average revenue per vendor of around
$40,000, but the distribution is wide and skewed. The
174 vendors range from a minimum revenue of $7,355
to a maximum of $1,148,403.
5.3 Marketplaces
Different marketplaces might develop different proﬁles
or specialties in terms of what they sell – i.e., they attract
a different set of vendors, offerings or buyers. To com-
pare the product portfolio of different markets, Figure
11 displays the distribution of offerings across different
categories. To deal with the large differences in size of
the categories, we ﬁrst take the logarithm of the number

Finally, we take a look at the listings in retail cybercrime.
This covers the categories of “accounts,” “fake,” “guide,”
“pirated,” and “voucher.” We brieﬂy describe the type of
listings assigned to those categories. “Accounts” denote
listings advertising small batches of accounts from ser-
vices like Netﬂix and Spotify. “Fake” contains offerings
of fake IDs, counterfeit documents or money. Listings
that sell mere instructions or tutorials, are categorized
as “guides.” The “pirated goods” category encompasses
listings that offer pirated movies, software or e-books.
Last, the “voucher” category comprise listings that offer
discounts at numerous places, ranging from discounted
airline tickets to pizza shop gift cards3. The retail cyber-
crime offerings are also forms of commoditization, albeit
a slightly atypical one. Indeed, these B2C products are
meant to be used or consummed by the buyer, and are
not parts for some large value chain with another proﬁt
center at the end of it.
The large portion of retail cybercrime is in line with
what has been observed on the drugs side of these mar-
kets; B2C transactions for consumers of drugs, along
with more modest amounts of B2B transactions with
larger quantities for lower-level dealers [8].
We do not know however what type of listings within
one category are the driving forces for these growing
number of listings, feedbacks, vendors and revenue. To
understand how commodization of cybercrime compo-
nents really takes place, we have to look at ﬁner grained
information. To do so, we next cluster listings within cy-
bercrime component categories and characterize the sup-
ply by analyzing the best-selling clusters within each cat-
egory.
6 Characterizing supply
We now want to delve deeper into what is actually being
offered in each category and how this supply compares to
the overall demand for criminal capability, resources and
services in that category. We apply unsupervised cluster-
ing to the listings in each category and then interpret the
three best-selling clusters.
6.1 Clustering listings
The detailed sub-classiﬁcation is created by identify-
ing clusters within our categories of listings using Topic
Modeling. We rely on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) [10] clustering algorithm to determine the main
3Interestingly, in underground slang, “pizza” may also denote credit
card listings—which are sold in “slices.” While this vernacular could a
priori be confusing to an automated classiﬁer, manual inspection sug-
gests misclassiﬁcation is very rare, as we will discuss later.
topics from a text corpus. We cleaned the data (removing
broken fragments and correcting egregious errors) and
lemmatized the words before clustering.
Our goal is to extract and analyze the three clusters
which represent the “main themes” in each category. A
natural choice might be to select the three clusters whose
items collectively generate the largest amount of rev-
enue. However we observed that a small fraction of very
expensive items tends to obfuscate this analysis, thus we
instead opted for identifying these “main theme” clusters
based on the number of unique feedbacks. LDA is pa-
rameterized by a hyper-parameter that upper bounds the
number of clusters to identify. Motivated by the expected
heterogeneity of listings in the categories of cybercrime
components, combined with the assumed homogeneity
in other categories, we set this parameter to 10. As a
consequence, it may be the case that LDA will not gen-
erate clusters for small categories of listings (when the
true number of clusters exceeds 10); and those will in-
stead be projected into larger clusters.
6.2 Best-selling clusters
We identiﬁed the three best-selling clusters per category
by summing the number of feedbacks of all listings in a
speciﬁc cluster. We then compute the total revenue gen-
erated by the item listings in each cluster. The results are
shown in Table 6. We excluded three categories from the
classiﬁcation, as explained in Section 4.4. For all cate-
gories, the three best-selling clusters contain more than
46% of all feedbacks, and in many cases more than 60%
of all feedbacks. Looking at revenue, we observe a dif-
fused pattern. The categories “botnet,” “website,” and
“RAT” show lower revenue numbers. Upon manual in-
spection, we could identify a very small cluster with only
a few feedback that was dominated by a few very expen-
sive items.
The second part of this clustering approach aims to
understanding which type of products and/or services are
transacted in these main clusters. To that end, we can use
the output features of our LDA clustering algorithm to la-
bel the prominent clusters, sometimes assisted by manual
inspection. In the next two sections, we present our ﬁnd-
ings and elaborate on whether the identiﬁed main topic
clusters ﬁt the overall demand for criminal capability, re-
sources and services following our conceptual model.
6.3 Clusters in cash-out offerings
The main clusters of the cash-out category in descending
order of size are 1) credit card details, more speciﬁcally
“bins” - i.e., computer-generated credit card numbers
that pass simple veriﬁcation, but are not actually issued
by banks, 2) so-called “fullz,” stolen credit cards, includ-
