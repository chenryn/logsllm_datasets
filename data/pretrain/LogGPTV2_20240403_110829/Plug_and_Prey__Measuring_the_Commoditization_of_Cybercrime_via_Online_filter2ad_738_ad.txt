### Date and Operational Halt
Their operations came to an abrupt halt in July 2017 when the FBI, in collaboration with the Dutch Police, shut down AlphaBay (and Hansa Market, which is not discussed here). Despite this, the overall trend clearly indicates growth. The trade in cybercrime commodities appears to be resilient to the turbulence across marketplaces.

### Feedback Trends
Figure 5 illustrates that the upward trend in feedback instances is not solely due to an increase in listings but also to an increase in the amount of feedback per listing. In 2011, a listing typically received around five pieces of feedback per month. Over time, this number rose to approximately eight pieces of feedback per listing by 2017, with intermediate spikes reaching over ten pieces of feedback in 2012. These spikes coincide with the period when Silk Road 1 gained public attention due to extensive media coverage in 2011 [1]. Conversely, the trough at the end of 2013 is primarily attributed to the takedown of Silk Road 1 and the subsequent chaotic weeks [40]. Overall, the average amount of feedback per listing stabilizes by mid-2012 and subsequently follows a slow, steady rise.

### Revenue Analysis
To understand the ecosystem, it is essential to identify which categories contribute most to the growth in sales and revenue. For each item listing, revenue is calculated by multiplying the specific feedback for a listing with the dollar price of that listing at the time the feedback was generated. This revenue is then aggregated per month and per category. Figure 6 shows the revenue per category, with spikes and troughs again reflecting marketplace turbulence.

The category of cash-out listings is the largest component of cybercrime in terms of listings, revenue, and vendors. A closer look reveals whether this revenue is driven by a small fraction of listings or represents a broader volume of trade. It turns out that a significant portion of the increase between 2014 and 2015 is driven by feedback on CVV listings. Specifically, one listing offering "US CVVs" received nearly 700 feedbacks in the first quarter of 2014. From early 2015 onwards, we see a steady growth in revenue alongside the growth of AlphaBay as a whole. In the early days of the ecosystem, an increase in cash-out revenue was primarily driven by a listing offering "10,000 USD CASH," which can be seen as typical money laundering—the customer pays in Bitcoin and receives cash.

### Vendors Over Time
Another aspect of commoditization is the level of vendor competition. Figure 8 shows the number of vendors per category over time. A vendor is considered active if they have at least one active item listing and may be simultaneously active in multiple categories.

### Market Specialization
To evaluate market specialization, we can look at categorical revenue. Figure 12 shows the percentage of revenue—after log transformation—per category of cybercrime component per market. The story remains consistent: there are no major differences between markets. If anything, the picture painted by looking at revenues is even more uniform across marketplaces.

### Distribution of Listings and Revenue
Listings and revenue are not normally distributed across vendors. As in many markets, there are big players and small players. Figure 10 plots the cumulative percentage of listings and revenue of cybercrime components over vendors. A small portion of vendors is responsible for a large fraction of the listings. Specifically, around 30% of vendors are responsible for 80% of all listings. More interestingly, just under 10% of vendors are responsible for generating 80% of the total revenue. This means that approximately 174 vendors have sold nearly $7 million worth of cybercrime components, translating into an average revenue per vendor of around $40,000, though the distribution is wide and skewed, ranging from a minimum of $7,355 to a maximum of $1,148,403.

### B2C Listings
Finally, we examine the listings in retail cybercrime, covering categories such as "accounts," "fake," "guide," "pirated," and "voucher." These categories include small batches of accounts from services like Netflix and Spotify, fake IDs and counterfeit documents, tutorials, pirated movies and software, and gift cards. Retail cybercrime offerings are also forms of commoditization, albeit slightly atypical, as these products are meant for direct use by the buyer and are not part of a larger value chain.

### Clustering and Supply Analysis
To delve deeper into what is being offered in each category and how this supply compares to the overall demand for criminal capabilities, we apply unsupervised clustering to the listings in each category and then interpret the three best-selling clusters. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the main topics from a text corpus, cleaning and lemmatizing the data before clustering.

### Best-Selling Clusters
We identified the three best-selling clusters per category by summing the number of feedbacks of all listings in a specific cluster and then computing the total revenue generated by the item listings in each cluster. The results are shown in Table 6. For all categories, the three best-selling clusters contain more than 46% of all feedbacks, and in many cases, more than 60% of all feedbacks. Looking at revenue, we observe a diffuse pattern, with some categories showing lower revenue numbers, often due to a few very expensive items.

### Clusters in Cash-Out Offerings
The main clusters in the cash-out category, in descending order of size, are:
1. Credit card details, specifically "bins" (computer-generated credit card numbers that pass simple verification but are not issued by banks).
2. "Fullz" (stolen credit cards, including personal information).

### Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the cybercrime ecosystem, highlighting the resilience of the market, the distribution of revenue and listings, and the key categories and clusters driving the trade. Further research will focus on finer-grained information to better understand the commoditization of cybercrime components.
