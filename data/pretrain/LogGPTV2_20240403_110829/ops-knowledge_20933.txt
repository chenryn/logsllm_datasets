User: How to implement FTP file transfer using Python?
Assistant: Using Python, FTP file transfer can be realized through the ftplib library. Here is a simple example: ```python import ftplib # Set FTP connection parameters ftp = ftplib.FTP('ftp.example.com') ftp.login('username', 'password') # Upload files with open( 'local-file.txt', 'rb') as f: ftp.storbinary('STOR remote-file.txt', f) # download file with open('local-file.txt', 'wb') as f : ftp.retrbinary('RETR remote-file.txt', f.write) # close the FTP connection ftp.quit() ``` Among them, `ftplib.FTP` is used to create an FTP connection, and `ftp.login` is used to Log in to the FTP server, `ftp.storbinary` is used to upload files, `ftp.retrbinary` is used to download files, and finally call `ftp.quit` to close the FTP connection. In actual use, you can also use some other methods, such as creating directories, deleting files, and so on.
