## Expected Behavior
`styled-components` should not result in the `className` mismatch warning from
React.
## Current Behavior
    Warning: Prop `className` did not match. Server: "Header-johx6c-0 bHIeEO" Client: "Header___default-johx6c-0 gGUBlx"
I'm exporting the header component like so:
    export default styled(Header)`
      text-align: center;
    `;
Notice that `styled-components` uses the name `Header` on the server and
`Header__default` on the client. This doesn't happen with Next.js 4, so I
assume it has something to do with the way modules are built with the new
Universal Webpack setup.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Use `styled-components` with `next` v5.
  2. Use `babel-plugin-styled-components` with the default `displayName` setting.
  3. Render a component exported like: `export default styled(Component)`
(It doesn't matter what the Babel plugin's `ssr` setting is, nor if the server
stylesheet is set up in `_document.js`. Same thing in every combination.)
