Abstract—Selecting and remembering secure passwords puts
a high cognitive burden on the user, which has adverse effects
on usability and security. Authentication schemes based on
implicit memory can relieve the user of the burden of actively
remembering a secure password. In this paper, we propose a
new authentication scheme (MooneyAuth) that relies on implicitly
remembering the content of previously seen Mooney images.
These images are thresholded two-tone images derived from
images containing single objects. Our scheme has two phases:
In the enrollment phase, a user is presented with Mooney images,
their corresponding original images, and labels. This creates an
implicit link between the Mooney image and the object in the
user’s memory that serves as the authentication secret. In the
authentication phase, the user has to label a set of Mooney images,
a task that gets performed with substantially fewer mistakes if
the images have been seen in the enrollment phase. We applied
an information-theoretical approach to compute the eligibility of
the user, based on which images were labeled correctly. This new
dynamic scoring is substantially better than previously proposed
static scoring by considering the surprisal of the observed events.
We built a prototype and performed three experiments with
230 and 70 participants over the course of 264 and 21 days,
respectively. We show that MooneyAuth outperforms current
implicit memory-based schemes, and demonstrates a promising
new approach for fallback authentication procedures on the Web.
I.
INTRODUCTION
User authentication is an essential requirement for modern
websites as more and more access-controlled services move
online. Existing user authentication schemes are commonly
based on something you know, such as passwords, something
you have, such as secure tokens, or something you are, such
as biometry. These authentication schemes suffer from the
competing requirements of security and usability [8], which
are hard to fulﬁll simultaneously. Furthermore, users seem
to disfavor password-based authentication [32], [23], hence
alternative schemes are becoming necessary [1]. Despite sub-
stantial research effort to improve the state-of-the-art, currently
deployed authentication methods are far from optimal.

This paper explores a new type of knowledge-based authen-
tication scheme that eases the high cognitive load of explicit
passwords and thus has the potential to improve the usability
and security of knowledge-based authentication. In particular,
we study how implicit memory can be used to design a usable,
deployable, and secure authentication scheme.
Current knowledge-based authentication schemes are based
on explicit memory, where users are asked to create a random
combination of characters as their authentication secret and
to explicitly provide this secret at the time of authentication.
Such secrets are usually very difﬁcult to remember as one
has to work consciously to remember the speciﬁc secret. In
contrast, with an implicit memory-based scheme, users ﬁrst
learn an association between a task and its solution. This
learned association is then used as the authentication secret.
Because recalling a situation that is stored in the implicit
memory is remembered with less effort [36], [37], almost
unconsciously, such an authentication scheme relieves users
of the high cognitive burden of remembering an explicit
password. This has the potential to offer usable, deployable,
and secure user authentication.
In this work, we built a novel, operational authentica-
tion scheme utilizing implicit memory based on Mooney
images [31]. A Mooney image is a degraded two-tone image
of a single object. This object is usually hard to recognize at
ﬁrst sight and becomes easier to recognize when the original
image was presented to the user.
Our scheme is composed of two phases: In the enrollment
phase, the user learns the association between a set of Mooney
images, their original versions, and labels describing the con-
tent of the image. This process is also called “priming”. During
the authentication phase, a larger set of Mooney images, in-
cluding the primed Mooney images from the enrollment phase,
are displayed to the user. The user is then asked to provide a
label for the hidden object in each Mooney image. Using our
dynamic scoring algorithm, the system computes an authenti-
cation score and provides or denies access accordingly. Due
to relatively slow enrollment and authentication, the current
scheme seems particularly suited for fallback authentication,
also known as account recovery.
We conducted three experiments to identify practical pa-
rameters, to measure long-term effects, and to determine the
performance of the scheme. We conducted Experiment 1 over
the course of 25 days with 360 participants of which 230
ﬁnished both phases. The results of this experiment were used
for parameter selection. To identify long-term priming effects
of Mooney images we re-invited the participants after 264 days
in Experiment 2. To validate the overall performance of the
scheme, we performed Experiment 3 with 70 new participants
over the course of 21 days.
A. Contributions
Our contributions include:
1) We present a novel authentication scheme, based on
implicit visual memory, that outperforms existing ones
in terms of false acceptance and false rejection rates, as
well as the time required for authentication.
2) To decide whether a user successfully passes the au-
thentication phase, the inputs have to be evaluated, i. e.,
“scored.” We propose an alternative scoring technique,
dynamic scoring, which is inspired by the notion of
self-information, also known as surprisal. We show that
our scoring technique substantially outperforms the static
scoring proposed in previous work by Denning et al. [16].
3) We demonstrate the practicability of our scheme by
implementing it and conduction three experiments.
The results show that MooneyAuth substantially out-
performs current implicit memory-based authentication
schemes [16].
4) We are the ﬁrst to study long-term priming effects of
Mooney images over a period as long as 8.5 months. The
results reveal a substantial long-term priming effect for
Mooney images, which implies that MooneyAuth is suited
for fallback authentication with long intervals between
enrollment and authentication.
B. Related Work
1) Implicit Memory-Based Authentication Schemes: Ap-
plying the knowledge about how humans store and recall in-
formation was ﬁrst applied to user authentication by Weinshall
and Kirkpatrick [43]. However, the proposed scheme made use
of the explicit characterization of images that were stored in
human memory, not implicit memory, and the performance of
the proposed scheme is unsuitable for deployment.
The scheme that comes closest
to MooneyAuth, using
implicit memory and the priming effect, was proposed by
Denning et al. [16]. They presented an authentication scheme
based on implicitly learning associations between degraded
drawings of familiar objects (e .g., animals, vehicles, or tools)
and their complete drawings. Each degraded drawing was cre-
ated by using fragmented lines instead of continuous lines. In
their paper, the authors presented a preliminary authentication
scheme and performed a user study. Their results show that
many of these drawings show a (small) priming effect, but this
effect is too small for using it in an authentication scheme for
all but two images they tested. As agreed by the authors, the
viability of such system concept is dependent upon being able
to systematically identify or create images with a sufﬁciently
strong priming effect. Our paper builds on this work to propose
a complete and efﬁcient system. We show that Mooney images
provide a strong priming effect necessary to implement such
a practical scheme, and we build a real prototype.
Bojinov et al. also proposed the concept of implicit learning
to design a scheme that resists coercion attacks where the
user is forcibly asked by an attacker to reveal the key [6].

The proposed scheme is based on a crafted computer game.
While the secret can be used for authentication, the participant
cannot be forced to reveal it since the user has no conscious
knowledge of it. The authors perform a number of user studies
using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to validate their scheme.
Although the proposed idea is very interesting, performance
results show that their scheme is not practical and cannot be
used for real-world applications: the registration phase takes
more than 45 minutes for a single password and put a lot of
cognitive burden on users.
2) Graphical Authentication Schemes: A number of graph-
ical password schemes share the idea of identifying trained
images from a set of decoy images. Probably the most well-
known scheme is PassFaces [34], which is based on the human
capability to recognize familiar faces. During authentication, a
set of faces is shown to a user, where the user selects known
ones. However, user bias in the selection of the images renders
the system vulnerable to guessing attacks [14].
The authentication scheme Use Your Illusion [22] also uses
degraded versions of images, i. e., blurred images, but still
relies on explicit memory. In this scheme, users are required to
generate an image portfolio, explicitly learn and memorize the
images belonging to the portfolio, i. e., via spaced repetitions,
and ﬁnally authenticate by re-identifying the set of images
that were distorted by an oil-painting ﬁlter. In contrast to
our evaluation, their user study did not test the long-term
performance, so it is unknown how this scheme performs over
time and whether it decreases the user’s cognitive burden.
Furthermore, the security of Use Your Illusion heavily depends
on the image degrading algorithm and its parameters, which
might be identiﬁable by a computer vision algorithm. In
contrast, we assume all images and their Mooney versions
including the labels are known to the attacker and show
that even in this case MooneyAuth is secure. Hence,
the
security of MooneyAuth does not rely on the fact that there
is no algorithm, which can recover the original image and
its label. Other graphical authentication schemes, based on
explicit memory, are surveyed in [4].
3) Fallback Authentication Schemes: One prominent use
case for MooneyAuth is fallback authentication. Such schemes
are used to help users recover their forgotten passwords.
Depending on the deployed system, the effort (authentication
time, and workload) can be higher than in primary authen-
tication systems, which are used on a daily basis. However,
the authentication secret obviously requires to be memorable
for longer timeframes, since it must still be available in the
case the primary means of authentication, e. g., the password
is forgotten.
The range of currently proposed or deployed fallback
authentication systems is not truly satisfying. The most fre-
quent systems are based on password reset via out-of-band
communication or personal knowledge questions. In the former
case, a registered email address, a mobile phone number, or
a mobile app on a smartphone of the user [18] is used to
send the original password, a new password, or a time-limited
password reset link. However, receiving such password reset
messages can be risky if not correctly implemented [10] and
can be error-prone if the contact details on record are out of
date. Furthermore, not all users like the idea of giving out their
cellphone number or email address due to privacy concerns.
Even worse, receiving messages is not always possible, i. e.,
using mobile data while abroad, or the receiving device is not
available.
If communicating over a secondary channel is not possible,
personal knowledge questions, sometimes called cognitive
passwords, are used. The security of such systems is well
studied [45]. However, as demonstrated by a number of recent
work [7], [9], [38], [21], their security is rather low, as the
secret answers to the asked questions can be easily guessed.
Renaud et al. [35] introduced a scheme based on asso-
ciations between images and text (selected by the user) as
a potential replacement for security questions. However, their
approach suffers from the drawbacks of explicit memory-based
schemes.
Authentication using information about the social graph
of a user, so-called social authentication, has been demon-
strated [12], [39]. Facebook deployed such a social scheme
called Trusted Contacts. As a secondary fallback-mechanism
users can choose up to ﬁve friends that receive parts of a
recovery code via email in the case the user has forgotten
the password. By collecting three or more parts of the code
one is able to reset the password. However, typical recovery
times can quickly rise from hours to days, which is a potential
drawback of this approach.

remembering
cryptographically-strong secrets via spaced repetition. In their
experiment, they enabled users to learn a limited number of
strong authentication secrets by displaying an additional code
that was required to login. This code did not change and was
only shown after an annoying delay which was increased at
every login attempt. The users were motivated to accelerate
the login procedure and not wait for the code to display, by
entering the code, which they subliminally learned by heart,
due to its continuous repetition. After some of such fast and
successful logins, the code was extended.
A similar user study, realized by Blocki et al. [5], improved
the repetition idea. Based on so-called Person-Action-Object
(PAO) stories they were able to combine associative and
repetitive memory to improve the concept. They asked their
participants to invent a story based on a shown photo, a user-
chosen famous person, and a randomly selected action-object
pair that served as authentication secret. In contrast to [11],
the users were able to see the complete secret at once and
were told that they are required to learn the secret. Finally,
the users were able to remember their secrets for longer times
with fewer rehearsals due to the PAO story mnemonic.

the concept of implicit memory and Mooney images. Our
scheme is described in Section III. Then, we present details on
the three experiments we performed. First, the pre-study for
estimating the required parameters in Section IV, a long-term
study proving that the priming effect of Mooney images last
over time in Section V, and the main study demonstrating the
general performance of the scheme in Section VI. We discuss

ﬁnal remarks in Section VIII.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Explicit vs. Implicit Memory
Explicit memory is a type of memory that is based on
intentional recollection of information with the purpose to con-
sciously recall this information at a later time. We use this type
of memory, also referred to as declarative memory, constantly
in our daily life [20]. For example when we remember the
time of our ﬂight the next day, recall our address, or a chain
of strings that forms our passwords.
In contrast, implicit memory relies on the unintentional
recollection of information. In this case, we are not aware
of the speciﬁc information we stored in our memory, but we
can easily recall the information. This type of memory, also
referred to as nondeclarative memory, can usually be observed
in habitual behavior, such as riding a bicycle or playing an
instrument [20]. The cognitive and neural mechanisms of
explicit and implicit memory are not entirely understood [19].
Some studies suggest a distinct mechanism for explicit and
implicit memory [36], [30], whereas others suggest a joint
mechanism [3], [42]. One way to trigger implicit memory is
an effect called priming [29], [13]. Priming occurs when the
previous exposure (conscious or unconscious) to a stimulus af-
fects the performance of a subsequent task. For example, when
a series of images with speciﬁc objects (primes) are presented
to the participants, their recognition performance (e. g., time
and correctness) of a similar object in another or the same
image that is presented later improves. Throughout this paper,
we use such priming effects that are based on repetition and
association. In a ﬁrst enrollment phase, we present participants
an association between a thresholded Mooney image and the
original image with a label. In a second authentication phase,
we repeat the previously primed Mooney image (among other
non-primed Mooney images) and measure the recognition
performance of the repeated image. In some cases, priming
has been shown to have long-lasting effects [13].
B. Mooney Images
A Mooney image is a thresholded, two-tone image showing
a single object. This object is hard to recognize at ﬁrst sight
with recognition times in second to minute range [25]. In some
cases, the recognition is abrupt and gives rise to a feeling
of having solved a difﬁcult problem (also known as the aha-
feeling or Eureka-effect) [27]. This abrupt recognition can
happen intrinsically [25], after the contour of the object is
marked [41], or after presenting the subject with the original
image [28], [24], [17]. Once a subject has seen the original
grayscale image from which the Mooney is generated, recog-
nition is much accelerated. An example of a Mooney image is
presented in Figure 11.
The value of using Mooney images for authentication
is that they are very likely to trigger brain processes that
are involved in implicit memory [2]. Implicit memory, as

some time trying to identify the object in Figure 1, and then look at Figure 7

stated above, does not require direct conscious involvement
but happens with less effort in comparison to explicit memory.
Triggering the implicit memory for authentication is therefore
desirable as it reduces the cognitive load for users. Priming is
one way to trigger implicit memory and Mooney images are
excellent example that can be used to prime participants to
speciﬁc concepts.

images, we suggest to spend some time trying to identify the hidden object,
and then to look at Figure 7 at the end of this paper.
III. THE MOONEYAUTH SCHEME
In the next section, we describe the basic construction
of our authentication scheme. We ﬁrst describe how Mooney
images are generated, and then present the two phases, enroll-
ment, and authentication, of our protocol.
A. Mooney Image Generation
In this work, we use an extended set of two-tone, Mooney
images that contain not only faces as used originally [31],
but also objects (e. g., animals, fruits, or tools) of different
types [17], [25].
We selected our Mooney images from an automatically
generated two-tone, Mooney image database [25]. This data-
base is based on a large number of images collected from
the Web. First, concrete nouns were selected from a linguistic
database [44] (based on the directness of reference to sense
experience, and capacity to arouse nonverbal images, cf. [25]).
These words were used as search terms to automatically
download images from an online image database. Second, the
images were converted to grayscale and were smoothed using
a 2D smooth operation with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 2 pixels
and full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 5 pixels). Third,
images were resized to have a size of 350×350 pixels (subsam-
pled with an appropriate scale factor). These parameters were
selected to create Mooney images that are hard to recognize
by a user at ﬁrst sight [26]. The smoothing operation is in par-
ticular important for the results as the thresholding algorithm
applied in the next stage operates better on smoothed images
than on not smoothed ones. Lastly, the smoothed and resized
images were thresholded using a histogram based thresholding
algorithm (Otsu’s thresholding method [33]) to generate the
Mooney images. This thresholding method assumes that each
image has two classes of pixel properties: A foreground and
a background. For each possible threshold,
the algorithm
iteratively computes the separability of the two classes and
