in four categories, i.e., SYSTEM TOOL (43.35%), GAME
(46.54%), TOOL (52.7%), and VIDEO(54.1%). We infer
that some apps in these categories keep consuming
a large amount of traﬃc, when users switch to use other
apps, or the screen-oﬀ traﬃc occurs with device sleeping [9].
This observation draws our attention. Usually, GAME apps
may embed some third-party advertisement libraries (ad-
libs). Besides ad-libs, VIDEO apps may often prefetch con-
tent. Hence, the background traﬃc of these apps should be
necessary. If we can ﬁnd reasonable explanations for back-
ground traﬃc, we denote such behavior as “reasonable”. For
example, some management apps such as Wandoujia and
anti-virus apps often need downloading or updating actions
at background. Otherwise, we annotate an app with “un-
known” if we can not judge whether the background traﬃc
is really necessary. We manually check some top apps with
high traﬃc consumptions to see whether these consumptions
are reasonable. We ﬁnd 14 apps that we are not quite clear
why they need background network privilege8. For example,
on average, an alarm clock app (at.samsung.powersleep)
daily consumes about 13 MB cellular traﬃc and 156 MB Wi-
Fi traﬃc at background for a user among about 300 users;
a LED ﬂashlight app (com.chenlei.flashlightfree) daily
consumes about 7 MB cellular traﬃc and 5 MB Wi-Fi traﬃc
at background for a user among about 20 users. Users may
suﬀer from lots of unnecessary loss of background cellular
data if they use these apps.
There are some reasons for producing background network
activities. One reason is that ad libraries are widely used in
a lot of apps, and may download and update advertisements
according to user contexts. We simply validate such reason
from two aspects. First, we crawl the user reviews of the 14
“suspicious” apps on Wandoujia, and check whether adver-
tisement issues are reported. From user reviews, 3 out of 14
apps are found with complaints about advertisement. Sec-
ond, by disassembling the .apk ﬁles and conducting program
analysis, we ﬁnd that 3 out of 14 apps include at least one
of popular advertisement libraries published on AppBrain9.
Although we are still not sure whether and how much these
advertisement libraries consume background network, we
believe such ﬁnding already brings awareness to end-users
about the potential traﬃc loss.
Another reason is that the misuses or even malicious grant-
ing of network permissions. Since our current case analysis is
manual, we plan to leverage our previously developed WHYPER
tool [15] to further dig out “suspicious” apps by combining
their permissions and descriptions.
In summary, the results show that users may be un-
aware that the traﬃc is “silently but maybe unex-
pectedly” consumed at background. It reminds users
to alert or kill background network activities after launch-
ing these apps. Background network activities may lead to
unnecessary data loss in a data plan, or imply some threats.

is a well-known platform for Android users and developers.
4675.2 Access Time Patterns
We then investigate the access time of network activities.
Intuitively, access time may reﬂect two important insights.
First, the foreground access time of an app indicates how
long a user interacts with it. Therefore, such metric can
imply how much the user likes or needs the app. Second,
similar to background data traﬃc, background access time
indicates how long an app connects to network when users
do not interact with it. Therefore, the background access
time can imply the “liveness” of the app after it is launched.
Similar to the study of data traﬃc, we ﬁrst illustrate the
access time distribution among app categories, as shown in
Table 1. When exploring the foreground access time, it is
not surprising that the COMMUNICATION apps account
for 49% cellular time and 35.26% against all apps. It is also
interesting to ﬁnd that users spend a lot of time on TOOL
(10.79% under cellular and 9.46% under Wi-Fi).
We investigate how much foreground and background ac-
count for network time, respectively. From Table 2, we are
surprised to observe that foreground time accounts for only
less than 2% (by aggregating W -Time(F) and C -Time(F))
in total network access time, whereas the background time
occupies more than 98% (by aggregating W -Time(B) and
C -Time(B)). In other words, most apps still keep “long-
and-live” TCP connection at background after being
launched, although they are not used by users. The
background network time may be reasonable for apps that
heavily rely on network, e.g., COMMUNICATION, and SO-
CIAL. For example, most of these apps require auto synchro-
nization or notiﬁcation. However, it hardly makes sense that
many apps from other categories have continuous network
connection at background. Although background network
activities do not always reﬂect more data traﬃc, they still
occupy network connections and may lead to unnecessary
energy cost.
6. PRICE-SENSITIVE PATTERNS
The preceding measurements provide us information on
some patterns of app selection and network usage. In this
section, we further explore these patterns by classifying users,
i.e., how these patterns are inﬂuenced by the prices
of devices. Our goal is motivated by two concerns: (1) do
users with devices of diﬀerent prices have diﬀerent
needs and interests in using apps? (2) if yes to (1),
how much do the prices of devices matter? In other
words, we would like to investigate whether the user’s usage
patterns are price sensitive.
6.1 Device Model Clustering
We cluster users by their device models from the Net-
worked App Set, that covers about 2 million users. We
ﬁnally have 12,091 device models. We present the num-
ber of users of each device model in Figure 10.
It is ob-
served that 96% device models have less than 500 users.
This number of users accounts for only less than 0.1% in
our dataset.
It demonstrates the heavy fragmentation of
Android devices. Therefore, we take a set of “popular ” de-
vice models, each of which has at least 500 users. We further
manually check these device models and merge some dupli-
cated device models. For example, GT 7100/7102/7108 all
refer to Galaxy Note 2 with the same hardware speciﬁcation,
but customized by diﬀerent network carriers such as China
Mobile and China Unicom. In this way, we ﬁnally label 327
Figure 10: CDF for Number of Users of Device Models
“popular” device models. Then, we categorize the 327 device
models according to their on-market sale prices. Although
the price of a device is cut down gradually after the device is
sold, such categorization could still roughly reﬂect economic
factors. We put each device model into one of ﬁve groups,
which are numbered as 1-5 in Table 3.
6.2 Apps Used Among Groups
We investigate the number of used apps among diﬀerent
groups, and present the distribution in Figure 11. Note that
we examine the apps from the Networked User Set, in-
dicating that they are exactly used by users. An immediate
observation is that the higher price a device model has,
the more apps are used on this device model. Such
ﬁnding might come from two reasons. First, the more expen-
sive device models usually provide more powerful hardware
speciﬁcations, e.g., faster CPU, larger RAM, and higher def-
inition of screen. The computation power should motivate
the users to install and use more apps. Second, more expen-
sive device models usually come from more famous manufac-
turers, such as Samsung, Motorola, LG. Such observation is
attributed to the fact that Android systems customized by
these manufacturers may pre-load more apps than cheaper
devices, and may lead to the problem of “bloatware”. We
download the factory ROM ﬁles of some representative de-
vice models from ROMJD10. For example, the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 (Group 5) has 18 pre-installed apps that
generate network activities, and the number on Galaxy S4
(Group 4) is 15.
In contrast, Meizu M040 (Group 1) has
only 9 pre-installed apps that generate network activities.
Although we sample only some device models, the ﬁnding
can support our hypothesis to some degree.
6.3 Network Activity Among Groups
Similar to the preceding analysis of network activities, we
show the CDF of data traﬃc and access time from diﬀer-
ent groups in Figure 12. We can ﬁnd that the usage
of Wi-Fi also tends to take a positive correlation
with device model price. In other words, the more ex-
pensive a device model is, the more Wi-Fi traﬃc its users
tend to consume. However, the situation is quite diﬀer-
ent for cellular traﬃc. The diﬀerences of cellular traﬃc
among Group 1-3 are quite marginal, where 80% users con-
sume less than 150 MB cellular traﬃc in one month. From

Group 4, the cellular traﬃc and the access time begin to in-
crease. Users from Group 5 consume the most cellular traﬃc
and the most access time. About 5% users from this group
use about 1GB cellular traﬃc. There may be two possible
reasons. First, as device models from Groups 4 and 5 are
more powerful, their users tend to connect to the network
and download more contents. Second, users from these two
groups could be supposed to have better economic back-
ground, so they are likely to aﬀord a higher-cost data plan
to use.
6.4 User Interest on Similar Apps
To explore whether users’ interests are aﬀected by de-
vice prices, we study how users from diﬀerent groups per-
form in selecting apps with the same or similar functional-
ities. We choose two typical types of networked apps: (1)
News Reader: we choose 5 popular apps: Netease, Sohu,
Phoenix, Tencent, and Sina; (2) Browser: we choose 8
popular browsers: Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Maxthon, UCWeb,
360Safe, Baidu, and Sogou. We show the foreground time
against device models. Some preference tendencies could be
found. For news reader apps, users from Groups 4 and 5
tend to use the Netease app, but users from Groups 1-3
tend to use the Sohu app. A similar ﬁnding could be found
(a) News Reader Apps
(b) Browser Apps
Figure 13: Similar App Preferences among User Groups
in Browser. Users from Groups 4 and 5 tend to use Chrome,
but users from Group 1-3 tend to use UCWeb and 360safe.
For better understanding the user preferences, we assume
that the features and performance may impact users from
diﬀerent groups. First, users in Groups 1-3 may prefer lo-
cal apps over international apps. For example, UCWeb and
360safe are both developed by local app providers in China,
and preferred over Chrome. Second, user interface designs
may inﬂuence target user groups. For example, the Ten-
cent news reader often embeds a video that ﬁts the textual
content browsed by users. Considering 42% of its users are
from Group 3, we can suppose that users in this group are
interested in watching videos instead of textual content. In
contrast, users from Groups 4-5 seem to prefer to go through
the textual content, so they prefer the Netease news reader.
Third, some speciﬁc features might motivate diﬀerent user
preferences. For example, Opera Mini is said to save traﬃc
by oﬄoading computation onto cloud, and its 60% users are
from Groups 1, 2, and 3. In summary, such ﬁnding im-
plies that device prices has impacts on app selection
and usage, and reﬂect diﬀerent user interests and
needs.

IMPLICATIONS
We have investigated the user behaviors and infer some
patterns. In this section, we summarize our ﬁndings. We not
only validate some ﬁndings that were reported in previous
studies based on a smaller scale of users, but also identify
