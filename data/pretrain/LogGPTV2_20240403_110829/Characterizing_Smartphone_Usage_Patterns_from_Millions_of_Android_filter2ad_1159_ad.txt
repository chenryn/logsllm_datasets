### Background and Foreground Traffic Analysis

The following percentages represent the traffic distribution for different app categories in both foreground (F) and background (B) states:

- **Foreground (F):**
  - VIDEO: 52.78%, 43.14%, 44.20%, 54.80%, 57.47%, 40.55%, 70.21%, 51.40%, 37.74%, 54.62%
  - TOOL: 42.62%, 48.57%, 48.01%, 49.23%, 48.43%, 50.02%, 43.34%, 45.57%, 48.13%, 43.43%
  - COMMUNICATION: 56.66%, 50.42%, 46.85%, 50.09%, 50.41%, 49.48%, 56.42%, 52.83%, 51.34%, 55.25%
  - MUSIC: 0.10%, 0.57%, 3.15%, 0.36%, 0.57%, 0.23%, 0.08%, 0.90%, 0.26%, 0.60%
  - SOCIAL: 0.63%, 0.43%, 1.99%, 0.32%, 0.59%, 0.26%, 0.17%, 0.69%, 0.28%, 0.71%

- **App Category Distribution (F):**
  - VIDEO: 1.28%
  - TOOL: 9.56%
  - COMMUNICATION: 27.48%
  - MUSIC: 5.67%
  - SOCIAL: 14.63%
  - SYSTEM TOOL: 2.80%
  - SHOPPING: 9.42%
  - EDUCATION: 5.46%
  - GAME: 8.80%
  - NEWS AND READING: 14.83%

- **Background (B):**
  - VIDEO: 0.81%, 8.16%, 12.42%, 4.35%, 7.26%, 5.07%, 3.29%, 3.76%, 10.34%, 5.91%

In four categories, i.e., SYSTEM TOOL (43.35%), GAME (46.54%), TOOL (52.7%), and VIDEO (54.1%), we observe that some apps continue to consume a significant amount of traffic even when users switch to other apps or when the device is in a screen-off state. This behavior is particularly notable in GAME and VIDEO apps, which often use third-party advertisement libraries (ad-libs) and prefetch content, respectively. We categorize such background traffic as "reasonable" if it serves a legitimate purpose, such as downloading or updating actions in management and anti-virus apps. Otherwise, we label the app as "unknown" if the necessity of the background traffic is unclear.

For example:
- An alarm clock app (at.samsung.powersleep) consumes about 13 MB of cellular traffic and 156 MB of Wi-Fi traffic daily in the background.
- A LED flashlight app (com.chenlei.flashlightfree) consumes about 7 MB of cellular traffic and 5 MB of Wi-Fi traffic daily in the background.

We manually checked 14 top apps with high traffic consumption and found that 3 out of these 14 apps had user complaints about advertisements. Additionally, 3 out of 14 apps included at least one popular advertisement library. This suggests that ad libraries may be a significant source of background network activity.

### Access Time Patterns

We then analyzed the access time of network activities, which can provide insights into how long users interact with an app (foreground access time) and how long an app remains connected to the network in the background (background access time).

- **Foreground Access Time:**
  - COMMUNICATION apps account for 49% of cellular time and 35.26% of Wi-Fi time.
  - TOOL apps account for 10.79% of cellular time and 9.46% of Wi-Fi time.

- **Background Access Time:**
  - Foreground time accounts for less than 2% of total network access time.
  - Background time accounts for more than 98% of total network access time.

This indicates that most apps maintain a "long-and-live" TCP connection in the background, even when not in use. While this is reasonable for apps like COMMUNICATION and SOCIAL, which require auto-synchronization or notifications, it is less justifiable for other app categories.

### Price-Sensitive Patterns

To further explore user patterns, we classified users based on the prices of their devices. Our goal was to determine if users with different device prices have different needs and interests in using apps.

- **Device Model Clustering:**
  - We clustered users by their device models, resulting in 12,091 unique models.
  - We focused on "popular" models with at least 500 users, leading to 327 labeled models.
  - These models were categorized into five price groups, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000+ Chinese Yuan.

- **Apps Used Among Groups:**
  - Higher-priced devices tend to have more apps installed and used.
  - This can be attributed to more powerful hardware and pre-installed apps (bloatware) on expensive devices.

- **Network Activity Among Groups:**
  - Wi-Fi usage positively correlates with device price.
  - Cellular traffic shows marginal differences among lower-priced groups but increases significantly in higher-priced groups.

- **User Interest on Similar Apps:**
  - Users from higher-priced groups (Groups 4 and 5) prefer Netease for news and Chrome for browsing.
  - Users from lower-priced groups (Groups 1-3) prefer Sohu for news and UCWeb/360safe for browsing.

These findings suggest that device prices influence app selection and usage, reflecting different user interests and needs.

### Implications

Our study validates previous findings and identifies new patterns in user behavior, including the significant impact of background network activities and the influence of device prices on app usage. These insights can help users and developers better understand and manage network traffic and app preferences.
