### 4.3 Skills Conflicting with "Stop" Command

After using a skill, users typically issue the "stop" command to terminate it. If not stopped, the skill may continue to listen to private conversations. To identify skills that do not stop even after receiving the "stop" command, we conducted an investigation. According to a survey [35], 91% of Alexa users use the "stop" command, 36% use "cancel," and only 14% use "exit." We sent the "stop" command to each skill and then used built-in functions (e.g., asking for the current time) to verify if the skill had exited. If the response was the current time, we confirmed that the skill had stopped. Otherwise, it was still active.

Although this method can be circumvented by hijacking built-in functions, we tested multiple functions to improve accuracy. In our experiments, we found that some skills behaved differently in simulators compared to real devices when receiving the "stop" command. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear. Therefore, after automatically detecting potentially harmful skills, we verified them on real devices. It is important to note that these differences only occur with the "stop" command; other voice commands behave consistently in both environments.

**Results:**
- We evaluated 28,904 Amazon skills and found that 802 did not stop after receiving the "stop" command in the simulator.
- Further testing on Echo devices revealed that 68 skills had issues on real smart speakers.
- This process took approximately 15 seconds per skill, totaling about 3 hours.
- We analyzed the 68 suspicious skills and identified three methods they used to eavesdrop:
  1. **32 skills** changed the default "stop" command to another command that users might not know. For example, the skill "Millennial Money" changes the stop command to "Iâ€™ve done."
  2. **29 skills** ignored the "stop" command after correctly receiving it, as verified from the communication history. For instance, the skill "My Birthday Month" always says it cannot get the stop command and continues its functions.
  3. **7 skills** exhibited more unusual behavior. For example, "Malignant Tweets" always returns "cannot find this skill" and continues to listen, while "Math-Training" replies "OK" but continues to listen for 6 seconds.

Regarding Google, their strict requirements for the exit operation limit the final response to a simple reply within 60 characters, which must be the last dialogue. No such issues were found with Google actions.

### 4.4 Skills Conflicting with Their Descriptions

We also investigated whether the information requested by a skill aligns with its description. This is challenging due to the diverse ways skills are described and the varying functionalities. We conducted a preliminary study by comparing similar skills. For example, two skills providing real estate information should both request addresses, but it would be unusual if one requested health status.

**Method:**
- We manually selected 100 typical skills across 10 categories that request various types of privacy information.
- We extracted keywords from the descriptions (nouns in the constituency-based parsing tree) to find skills with similar functionalities.
- We compared the behaviors and privacy information requests of these skills to identify abnormal ones.

**Results:**
- After manual verification, fewer than 10 skills requested personal information that did not match their descriptions.
- For example, "Ehrlich Pest Control" is supposed to provide pest prevention tips but asks for phone numbers and area codes if it does not understand a user's question. This skill has low ratings, with users reporting concerns about privacy.

### 5. Discussion

#### 5.1 Defense Suggestions

While SkillExplorer can supplement market administrators' vetting processes, we offer the following suggestions:
1. **Strict Review:** Skills should be thoroughly reviewed before being published, especially those related to privacy.
2. **NLP Integration:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) should be included in the automatic analysis to address technical challenges.
3. **Privacy Policy Checks:** Privacy policy links should be strictly checked to ensure users understand what personal information will be requested.
4. **Built-in Intents:** Built-in intents, such as the "stop" command, should be carefully examined to prevent malicious behavior.

#### 5.2 Limitations and Future Work

1. **Accuracy Improvement:** Current NLP tools struggle with irregularly designed questions and punctuation. Future work will focus on improving NLP tools to handle these cases better.
2. **Simulator Limitations:** Simulators have restrictions on interactions with mobile phones, geographical location transmission, and non-text audio. These limitations will be addressed in future research.

### 6. Related Work

#### Attacks on Skills

Recent studies have explored the invocation mechanisms of skills. Kumar et al. discovered skill squatting, a homophonic attack that diverts user requests to undesired skills. Zhang et al. [35] found voice squatting and voice masquerading, allowing similarly pronounced skills to hijack legitimate ones. SR Labs [3] demonstrated how a malicious skill can eavesdrop after receiving the "stop" command. Our work differs by performing a large-scale analysis and identifying 68 problematic skills in the market.

#### Attacks on Smart Speakers

Studies have analyzed the security and privacy of IoT devices, including smart speakers. Carlini et al. [20] performed Hidden Voice attacks on Amazon Echo, proving the feasibility of audio attacks. DolphinAttack [34] modulates voice commands on ultrasonic carriers, and Yuan et al. [21, 33] integrated commands into songs. These studies focus on injecting commands without human detection, unlike our focus on skill behaviors.

### 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we present the first systematic study on the behaviors of skills, using grammar-based methods and developing SkillExplorer. We analyzed 28,904 Amazon skills and 1,897 Google actions, finding over 1,000 skills requesting personal information without proper specifications and 68 skills continuing to eavesdrop after the "stop" command.
