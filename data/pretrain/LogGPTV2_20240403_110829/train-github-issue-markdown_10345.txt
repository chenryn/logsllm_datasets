I have three screens connected to my PC: one is connected to the internal graphics card, and the other two are connected via an external USB-C dock. When I move a Terminal window from one of the external screens to the screen on the internal graphics card, the program crashes (Version: 0.6.2951.0).

The error message I receive is as follows:
- Unhandled exception at 0x00007FF8FEF42DC0 in WindowsTerminal.exe (Windows.UI.Xaml.dll): 0xC000027B: An internal application exception has occurred (parameters: 0x000001A4EF7FDD90, #0x0000000000000001).
