User: For a Linux system, I am writing a program in Python, who spawns child processes. I am using the "multiprocessing" library and I am wondering if there is a method to call sub-processes with a different user than the current one. I'd like to be able to run each subprocess with a different user (like Postfix, for example.)
Any idea or pointers ?
Assistant: You could look in os.setpgid(pid, pgrp) direction.
