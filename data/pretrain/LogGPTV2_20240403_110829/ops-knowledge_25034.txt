User: How do people handle timezones in Tornado so that users see time formatted relative to their timezone? I know there's locale.format_date which defaults to GMT, but how do I set the right timezone based on the user?
Assistant: Pardon my dimness but why do you mean to format the date based on the user in the context of Tornado? Tornado is a server. The user is a client.
