I have installed the Windows 7 (64-bit) version of Atom 1.0, and I am unable to input the character "ß" using the key combination Alt-Gr + ß on a German keyboard. This issue occurs both in LaTeX files and in regular text files. 

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this problem?
