Assistant: In the Windows environment, multiple PHP versions can be run at the same time through the following schemes: 1. Use virtual machines: You can install multiple virtual machines in Windows, install the required PHP versions and related environments in different virtual machines, and then use Virtual machines to access different versions of PHP. 2. Use container technology: You can use container technology such as Docker, install Docker in Windows, and create containers of multiple PHP versions in Docker, and then access different versions of PHP through different containers. 3. Use WampServer, Xampp and other tools: These tools can help quickly build a PHP development environment, you can configure multiple PHP versions in these tools, and access different versions of PHP through different ports. 4. Manually install multiple PHP versions: You can also manually download and install multiple PHP versions, and configure different environment variables and ports to run multiple PHP versions at the same time.
