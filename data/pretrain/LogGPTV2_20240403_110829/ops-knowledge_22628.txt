User: Please introduce the definition, advantages and application scenarios of virtualization technology in detail.
Assistant: 1. Definition Virtualization technology is a technology that divides a physical computer into multiple virtual computers. Each virtual computer runs independently and has its own operating system, applications and data. 2. Advantages (1) High resource utilization: virtualization technology divides a physical computer into multiple virtual computers, which can make better use of computer hardware resources and avoid idle resources. (2) Strong resource isolation: virtual machines are independent of each other, avoiding the sharing and competition of physical machine resources, and can perform corresponding security isolation. (3) High flexibility: The virtual machine can be migrated between different physical servers, which means that the normal use of users can not be affected in terms of maintenance, fault repair or upgrade. (4) Cost saving: Through virtualization technology, one server can run multiple independent operating systems, which means that it is no longer necessary to purchase multiple physical servers, which saves costs. 3. Application scenarios (1) Server virtualization divides a physical server into multiple virtual servers, each of which can run different operating systems and applications, and realize resource sharing and efficient utilization on this basis. (2) Application virtualization runs applications in virtual machines, reducing the interference and dependence between different applications, which can better isolate applications and operating systems. (3) Desktop virtualization Desktop virtualization is often used in small and medium-sized enterprises, and the virtual machines of multiple users are placed on one physical machine, which also provides users with better user experience and security.
