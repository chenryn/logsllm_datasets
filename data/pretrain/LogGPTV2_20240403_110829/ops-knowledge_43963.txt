User: I have a python gui that access files on windows as C:\data and C:\MyDIR all outside my doc's.
On, a linux sys i created /data and /MyDIR.
My gui cant access. I foresee always using C:\data and C:\MyDIR on both systems.  
How do I fix code or Linux permissions to have access to both dir and sub directories.
Assistant: i created \data and \MyDIR

First, no you didn't. Paths use / in linux, not \.
Second, do NOT create directories in the root directory unless you know exactly what you're doing. True, you're not going to hurt anything by doing this, but it's extremely bad practice and should be avoided except for specific cases.
Linux is a multi-user OS. If you have configuration files that the user can write to, they should be in the user's home directory somewhere. If you have config files that are read only, they should be installed somewhere such as /etc/.
