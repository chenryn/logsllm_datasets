ever, CIL does not provide a syntax for describing games
and does not oﬀer support for automation.
9. CONCLUSION
We have introduced a formal logic that supports concise
and intuitive proofs of cryptographic constructions, and pre-
sented the AutoG&P tool, which implements the logic for the
specialized case of pairing-based cryptography. Our exper-
iments show that formal proofs of complex pairing-based
constructions are now within reach. Future work includes
extending the scope of AutoG&P to accommodate i. q-type
and interactive assumptions; ii. random oracles; iii. key ex-
change protocols; iv. other types of constructions, including
(structure preserving) signatures; v. other areas, including
lattice-based cryptography. In addition, we plan to explore
the possibility to build on top of AutoG&P automated proof
transformations from Type I to Type III settings [4, 3], or
composite-order via prime-order groups [25, 32, 30].
