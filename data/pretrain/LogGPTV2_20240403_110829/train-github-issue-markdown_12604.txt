I encountered a peculiar issue that only occurs on Huawei phones. Below is the phone information:

The application runs successfully during the first inference, but it crashes consistently on the second attempt. Here is the crash log:

I processed the crash information using `ndk-stack`, but I was unable to pinpoint the exact location in the TensorFlow source code. This is because I built TensorFlow Lite from source without debug symbols, and I am not familiar with how to build it with debug symbols.

Here are some of the methods I have tried for building TensorFlow Lite with debug symbols, but none were successful:

1. Using Bazel:
   ```sh
   bazel build -c dbg --strip=never --compilation_mode=dbg --per_file_copt=//tensorflow/lite/.*.cc@-g,-O0 //tensorflow/lite:libtensorflowLite.so --crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool --cpu=armeabi-v7a --host_crosstool_top=@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain --cxxopt="-std=c++11"
   ```

   With the flags `-c dbg --strip=never --compilation_mode=dbg`:

   The crash occurred at line 62.

This issue specifically affects Huawei phones; other Android devices and iOS devices do not experience this crash. Additionally, the final crash point is at line 277, as shown below:

I suspect that the `bias_data` address is invalid, as indicated by the following image:
