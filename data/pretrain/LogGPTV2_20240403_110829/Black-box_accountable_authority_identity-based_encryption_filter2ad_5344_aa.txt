ABSTRACT
A well-known concern in the setting of identity based en-
cryption is that the PKG is all powerful and has to be
completely trusted. To mitigate this problem, the notion of
Accountable Authority Identity-Based Encryption (A-IBE)
was recently introduced by Goyal. Goyal provided construc-
tions to realize the notion of A-IBE only in the white box
and weak black box models. However, the security guaran-
tees provided by these models fall short of those required in
practice.
In this paper, we resolve the main open question left in
Goyal’s work by providing a construction of a (fully) black
box A-IBE system. Our construction is based on the De-
cisional Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman assumption and uses tech-
niques from key policy attribute based encryption.

INTRODUCTION
Shamir [24] introduced the concept of identity based en-
cryption (IBE) as an approach to simplify public key and
certiﬁcate management in a public key infrastructure (PKI).
The ﬁrst practical and fully functional IBE scheme was pro-
posed by Boneh and Franklin [6] in the random oracle model.
Following that work, a rapid development of identity based
PKI has taken place (see [11, 3, 4, 5, 25, 16] and the refer-
ences therein).
In an IBE system, the public key of a user may be an
arbitrary string like an e-mail address or other identiﬁer. Of
course, users are not capable of generating a private key for
an identity themselves. For this reason, there is a trusted
party called the private key generator (PKG) who does the
system setup. To obtain a private key for his identity, a
user would go to the PKG and prove his identity. The PKG
would then generate the appropriate private key and pass it
on to the user.
Such a setting, however, leads to the following problem.
Since the PKG is able to compute the private key corre-
sponding to any identity, it has to be completely trusted.
The PKG is free to engage in malicious activities without
any risk of being confronted in a court of law. The malicious
activities could include: decrypting and reading messages
meant for any user, or worse still: generating and distribut-
ing private keys for any identity. This, in fact, has been
cited as a reason for the slow adoption of IBE despite its
nice properties in terms of usability. It has been argued that
due to the inherent key escrow problem, the use of IBE is
restricted to small and closed groups where a central trusted
authority is available [1, 21, 15].
Accountable Authority Identity Based Encryption.
Goyal [17] introduced the notion of Accountable Authority
Identity Based Encryption (A-IBE) as a new approach to
mitigate the above problem of trust. Informally speaking,
the simpliﬁed view of the approach is as follows:
1. In the IBE scheme, there will be an exponential (or
super-polynomial) number of possible decryption keys
corresponding to every identity ID.
2. Given one decryption key for an identity, it is intractable
to ﬁnd any other.
3. A users gets the decryption key corresponding to his
identity from the PKG using a secure key generation
protocol. The protocol allows the user to obtain a sin-
gle decryption key dID for his identity without letting
the PKG know which key he obtained.
4. Now if the PKG generates a decryption key d0
ID for
that identity for malicious usage, with all but negli-
gible probability, it will be diﬀerent from the key dID
which the user obtained. Hence the key pair (dID, d0
ID)
is a cryptographic proof of malicious behavior by the
PKG (since in normal circumstances, only one key per
identity should be in circulation).
ID, dID) as a proof of fraud.
Thus, this approach severely restricts the PKG as far as
malicious distribution of the private keys is concerned. The
knowledge of the key d0
ID enables an entity E to go to the
honest user U (with identity ID and having key dID) and
together with him, sue the PKG by presenting the pair
(d0
The Right Model for A-IBE. Goyal [17] presented two
constructions towards achieving the notion of A-IBE. How-
ever, his security proofs could only provide a limited guar-
antee: that the PKG cannot maliciously distribute a well-
formed decryption key. As noted by Goyal, while this is
a starting point, these kind of “white box” guarantees are
completely insuﬃcient in practice. The PKG could, for ex-
ample, release an obfuscated program (or simply a decryp-
tion box) which successfully decrypts the ciphertexts and yet
does not contain the decryption key in any canonical form.
Furthermore trivial constructions can satisfy the “white box”
security guarantee and clearly be insecure in practice: For
instance, if we take any IBE scheme and force the user to
also obtain a blind signature from the PKG on a random
message (which is checked by the decryption algorithm),
this would already satisfy the “white box” security deﬁni-
tion. Obviously this scheme would be completely broken
in practice since the PKG could release a box that decrypts
for an identity but doesn’t contain a signature (and therefore
isn’t well-formed).
Goyal also showed how to extend his constructions to
achieve security guarantees according to a weak black box
model in which, a malicious PKG has to output a decryp-
tion box just after running the key generation protocol with
the honest user. However, this security model is also insuf-
ﬁcient. It is conceivable that the PKG (or a party colluding
with the PKG) could trick the user into decrypting a mali-
ciously prepared ciphertext and see the result (in an attempt
to learn more information about the decryption key which
the user selected during the key generation protocol). In-
deed, if such decryption queries are allowed, the weak black
box scheme of [17] can be broken with only a small number
of queries.
In what we call the full black box model, the PKG is given
access to decryption queries and no assumptions are made
regarding how the decryption box works. In particular, just
by observing the input/output behavior of the given decryp-
tion box, a judge should be able to decide if the box was
created by the actual user or by a dishonest PKG. The con-
struction of an A-IBE scheme in the full black box model -
the model which we believe provides the “right” real world
security guarantees - was left as an important open problem
in [17].
Our Contribution.
In this work, we resolve the above
open question and provide a construction of (fully black
box) A-IBE based on the Decisional Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman
(DBDH) assumption. The main technical diﬃculty is re-
solving the tension between the information leaked as part
of the decryption queries and the success of the exoneration
procedure. That is, on one hand we require that during reg-
ular operation, the outcome of the decryption of a ciphertext
should not leak information about the which decryption key
the user selected. On the other hand, during exoneration,
a judge should be able to extract enough information about
the user key selection from the black box in order to deter-
mine that the user could not have generated the box (and
therefore the PKG must be at fault).
The key idea in our construction is to ﬁrst design a scheme
having imperfect completeness. That is, for every possible
decryption key, there exist a negligible fraction of (valid) ci-
phertexts which cannot be decrypted by this key. On one
hand, this property is helpful in tracing: a judge (given the
decryption box and the decryption key of the user) can probe
the box exactly on those ciphertexts which the user key
should not be able to decrypt. On the other hand, this does
not seem to create a problem for decryption queries since
the chance that a malicious PKG will hit such a ciphertext
(with a polynomial number of queries) is negligible.
We construct such a scheme using ideas from key-policy
attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) [23, 19]. Very roughly,
we label each ciphertext as well as a decryption key with a
list of dummy attributes. There exists a policy which de-
cides whether or not a ciphertext will be decrypted by a
particular private key. To achieve statistical completeness,
for every decryption key, all but a negligible fraction of ci-
phertexts will satisfy this policy.
While we take the approach of constructing such an A-
IBE scheme with imperfect completeness, we will later show
how to run a “complementary” system in parallel with such
a scheme so that the resulting system also achieves the prop-
erty of perfect completeness (while also maintaining the func-
tionality of our tracing procedure).
Related Work. The idea of an accountable authority IBE
was introduced by Goyal [17] as a mitigation to the problem
of trust in the PKG. Au et. al.
[2] extended this work by
introducing a retrieval algorithm which causes the PKG’s
master secret key to be revealed if more than one key per
identity is released. The motivation is to penalize the PKG
without the users having to go to the court. However, this
work is orthogonal to ours since their security proofs are in
the white box model of security (as opposed to black box or
even weakly black box) and require the PKG to release a well
formed decryption key. To our knowledge, these are the only
known mitigation approaches without using multiple PKGs.
On the multiple PKGs side, Boneh and Franklin [6] proposed
an eﬃcient approach to make the PKG distributed in their
scheme using techniques from threshold cryptography.
Lee et al [21] proposed a variant of this approach using
multiple key privacy agents (KPAs).
Organization. In Section 2 we review background infor-
mation pertaining to our constructions. In Section 3 we for-
mally deﬁne the model for an accountable authority identity
based encryption scheme. In Section 4 we give a construc-
tion of such a scheme and prove that it satisﬁes the deﬁni-
tions in our model. The construction will have statistical
completeness and we describe in the full paper [18] how to
achieve perfect completeness. Finally, in Section 5 we con-
clude with interesting open problems for future work.
2. PRELIMINARIES
2.1 Bilinear Maps
We present a few facts related to groups with eﬃciently
computable bilinear maps.
Let G1 and G2 be two multiplicative cyclic groups of prime
order p. Let g be a generator of G1 and e be a bilinear map,
e : G1 × G1 → G2. The bilinear map e has the following
properties:
1. Bilinearity: For all u, v ∈ G1 and a, b ∈ Zp, we have
e(ua, vb) = e(u, v)ab.
2. Non-degeneracy: e(g, g) 6= 1.
We say that G1 is a bilinear group if the group operation
in G1 and the bilinear map e : G1 × G1 → G2 are both
eﬃciently computable. Notice that the map e is symmetric
since e(ga, gb) = e(g, g)ab = e(gb, ga).
2.2 Complexity Assumptions
We state our complexity assumptions below.
Decisional Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman (DBDH) Assump-
tion Let a, b, c, z ∈ Zp be chosen at random and g be a
generator of G1. The Decisional BDH assumption [3, 23] is
that no probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm B can dis-
tinguish the tuple (A = ga, B = gb, C = gc, e(g, g)abc) from
the tuple (A = ga, B = gb, C = gc, e(g, g)z) with more than
a negligible advantage. The advantage of B is
Pr[B(A, B, C, e(g, g)abc) = 0] − Pr[B(A, B, C, e(g, g)z) = 0]
where the probability is taken over the random choice of the
generator g, the random choice of a, b, c, z in Zp, and the
random bits consumed by B.
2.3 Fully Simulatable k-out-of-n Oblivious
Transfer
Informally speaking, a k-out-of-n oblivious transfer proto-
col (see [14]) allows a receiver to choose and receive exactly
k of the n string from the sender, such that the remaining
strings are hidden from the receiver and the choice of the
receiver is hidden from the sender. We require the oblivi-
ous transfer protocol to be fully simulatable (i.e. satisfy the
standard Ideal/Real world deﬁnition of security, see Canetti
[10] for more details). Various eﬃcient constructions of k-
out-of-n oblivious transfer are known based on speciﬁc as-
sumptions such as DBDH and DDH [22, 20, 9].
2.4 Attribute Based Encryption
The notion of key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-
ABE) was introduced by Sahai and Waters [23] considered
a user having a set of attributes (I) associated to him or
her. Similarly, when encrypting, the ciphertext also has
a set of attributes (J ) associated to it. At a high level
view, this scheme allowed a PKG to distribute user keys
with a policy that a user can only decrypt when their set
of attributes “properly matched” the set of attributes in the
ciphertext. The original Sahai-Waters work gave construc-
tions for threshold policies (i.e. |I ∩J | > τ for some thresh-
old τ ), and this was further generalized by Goyal et. al. [19]
for more advanced policies including those representable by
trees of threshold functions. Our constructions are partially
based oﬀ of these schemes; we will also have sets associated
to the user and the ciphertext, and it will be convenient to
keep the notion of “attributes” in mind. We refer the reader
to [19] for the details of the construction of an attribute-
based encryption scheme.
