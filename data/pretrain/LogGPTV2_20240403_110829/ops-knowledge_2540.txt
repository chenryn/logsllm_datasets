User: I would like to launch a python program.exe to test it from another python code i,e launch it on the cmd (myprogram.exe -a arg1 -b arg2) and eventually get the error message it can print or any console output 
does anyone have an idea how to do this?
thanks
EDIT 
Actually I launch it with os.popen(command) but what I want is to know if it ended with sys.exit or any exception or if it ended normally
PS:I'm running python 2.6 (can't use subprocess.check_output ) 
Thanks
Assistant: You can run any python command from cmd using Python.exe -c //code
For example, Python.exe -c print(10*10) will print 100 to your console. 
Does this help? Your question is a little unclear, sorry.
