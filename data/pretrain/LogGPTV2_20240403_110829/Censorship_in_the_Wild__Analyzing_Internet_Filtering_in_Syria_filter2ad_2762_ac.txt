Table 4: Top-10 Domains (allowed and censored) in Df ull.
In Table 4, we report the top-10 allowed (resp., censored) domains
in Df ull. Unsurprisingly, google.com and its associated static/track-
ing/advertisement components represent nearly 15% of the total
allowed requests. Other well-ranked domains include facebook.com
(and its associated CDN service, fbcdn.net) and xvideos.com (a
pornography-associated website). The top-10 censored domains
exhibit a very different distribution: facebook.com (and fbcdn.net),
metacafe.com (a popular user-contributed video sharing service)
and skype.com account for more than 43% of the overall censored
requests. Websites like Facebook and Google are present both in
the censored and the allowed trafﬁc, since the policy-based ﬁltering
may depend on the actual content the user is fetching rather than
the website, as we will explain in Section 6. Finally, observe that
mediaﬁre.com is ranked at #9 in the top non-censored domains: ac-
cording to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), mediaﬁre.com
was actually used to deliver malware targeting Syrian activists.2
Categories. The Blue Coat proxies support ﬁltering according to
URL categories. This categorization can be done using a local
database, or using Blue Coat’s online ﬁltering tool.3 However,
according to Blue Coat’s representatives [25], the online services
are not accessible to the Syrian proxy servers, and apparently the
Syrian proxy servers are not using a local copy of this categorization
database. Indeed, the cs-categories ﬁeld in the logs, which records
the URL categories, contains only one of two values: one value
associated with a default category (named “unavailable” in ﬁve of the
proxies, and “none” in the other two), and another value associated
with a custom category targeted at Facebook pages (named “Blocked
sites; unavailable” in ﬁve of the proxies, and “Blocked sites” in the
other two), which is discussed in more details in Section 6.

Figure 3: Category distribution of censored trafﬁc (Dsample). Cat-
egories obtained from McAfee’s TrustedSource, ‘Other’ is used for
categories with less than 1K requests.
Due to the absence of URL categories, we use McAfee’s Trusted-
Source tool (www.trustedsource.org) to characterize the censored
websites. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the censored requests
across the different categories. The “Content Server” category ranks
ﬁrst, with more than 25% of the blocked requests (this category
mostly includes CDNs that host a variety of websites, such as
cloudfront.net, googleusercontent.com). “Streaming Media” are
next, hinting at the intention of the censors to block video sharing.
“Instant Messaging” (IM) websites, as well as “Portals Sites”, are
also highly blocked, possibly due to their role in coordination of
social activities and protests. Note that both Skype and live.com
IM services are always censored and belong to the top-10 censored
domains. However, surprisingly, both “News Portals” and “Social
Networks” rank relatively low: as we explain in Section 6, censor-
ship only blocks a few well-targeted social media pages. Finally,
categories like “Games” and “Education/Reference” are also occa-
sionally blocked.
HTTPS trafﬁc. The number of HTTPS requests is a few orders
of magnitude lower than that of HTTP requests. HTTPS accounts
for 0.08% of the overall trafﬁc and only a small fraction (0.82%) is
censored (Dsample dataset). It is interesting to observe that, in 82%
of the censored trafﬁc, the destination ﬁeld indicates an IP address
rather than a domain, and such an IP-based blocking occurs at least
for two main reasons: (1) the IP address belongs to an Israeli AS, or
(2) the IP address is associated with an Anonymizer service. The
remaining part of the censored HTTPS trafﬁc actually contains a
289hostname: this is possible due to the use of the HTTP CONNECT
method, which allows the proxy to identify both the destination host
and the user agent (for instance, all connections to Skype servers
are using the CONNECT method, and thus the proxy can censor
requests based on the skype.com domain).
According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Syrian Tele-
com Ministry has launched man in the middle (MITM) attacks
against the HTTPS version of Facebook.4 While Blue Coat proxies
indeed support interception of HTTPS trafﬁc,5 we do not identify
any clear sign of such an activity. For instance, the values of ﬁelds
such as cs-uri-path, cs-uri-query and cs-uri-ext, which would have
been available to the proxies in a MITM attack, are not present
in HTTPS requests. However, also note that, by default, the Blue
Coat proxies use a separate log facility to record SSL trafﬁc,6 so it
is possible that this trafﬁc has been recorded in logs that were not
obtained by Telecomix.
User-based analysis. Based on the Duser dataset, which comprises
the logs of proxy SG-42 from July 22-23, we analyze user behavior
with respect to censorship. We assume that each unique combination
of c-ip (client IP address) and cs-user-agent designates a unique
user. This means that a user connecting from several devices with
different IP addresses (or a single device with different browsers)
is not considered as a single users. Conversely, users behind NAT
using browsers with identical user-agent are counted as one user.
However, this combination of ﬁelds provides the best approximation
of unique users within the limits of the available data [31].
We identify 147,802 total users in Duser. 2,319 (1.57%) of
them generate at least one request that is denied due to censorship.
Fig. 4(a) shows the distribution of the number of censored requests
per user. We observe that 37.8% of these users have only a single
request censored during the observed period. Typically, users do
not attempt to access a URL again once it is blocked, but, in some
cases, we do observe a few more requests to the same URL. Overall,
for 93.87% of the users, all the censored requests (one or more per
user) are to the same domain. We also look at the distribution of
the number of overall requests per user, for both non-censored and
censored users, where a censored user is deﬁned as a user for whom
at least one request was censored. Censored users are more active
than non-censored users: approximately 50% of the censored users
generate more than 100 requests, while only 5% of non-censored
users have the same level of activity. This might be explained due to
the fact that, as discussed in Section 5.4, many requests are censored
since they include a blacklisted keyword (e.g., proxy), and active
users are more likely to encounter these keywords.
Fig. 4(b) shows the distribution of the number of overall requests
per user, for both non-censored and censored users, where a cen-
sored user is deﬁned as a user for whom at least one request was
censored. We found that the censored users are more active than non-
censored users, observing approximately 50% of the censored users
have sent more than 100 requests, while only 5% of non-censored
users show the same level of activity. As we discuss in Section 5.4,
many requests are censored since they happen to contain a black-
listed keyword (e.g., proxy), even though they may not be actually
accessing content that is the target of censorship. Since active users
are more likely to encounter URLs that contain such keywords, this
may explain the correlation between the user level of activity and
being censored. We also observe that in some cases the user agent

ﬁeld refers to a software repeatedly trying to access a censored page
(e.g., skype.com), which augments the user’s activity.
Summary. Our measurements have shown that only a small fraction
(<1%) of the trafﬁc is actually censored. Most requests are either
allowed (93.28%) or denied due to network errors (5.37%). Cen-
sorship targets mostly HTTP content, but several other services are
also blocked. Unsurprisingly, most of the censorship activity targets
websites that support user interaction (e.g., Instant Messaging and
social networks). A closer look at the top allowed and censored
domains shows that some hosts are in both categories, thus hinting
at a more sophisticated censoring mechanism, which we explore in
the next sections. Finally, our user-based analysis has shown that
only a small fraction of users are directly affected by censorship.
5. UNDERSTANDING THE CENSORSHIP
This section aims to understand the way the Internet is ﬁltered
in Syria. We analyze censorship’s temporal characteristics and
compare the behavior of different proxies. Then, we study how the
requests are ﬁltered and infer characteristics on which censorship
policies are based.
5.1 Temporal Analysis
We start by looking at how the trafﬁc volume of both censored
and allowed trafﬁc changes over time (5 days), with 5-minute gran-
ularity. The corresponding time-series are reported in Fig. 5(a): as
expected, they roughly follow the same patterns, with an increasing
volume of trafﬁc early mornings, followed by a smooth lull during
afternoons and nights. To evaluate the overall variation of the cen-

sudden decay. A few other peaks are also observed early morning
(5am) and evening (10pm).
We then analyze the distribution of censored content between
8am and 9.30am on August 3 and, in Table 5, we report the top-10
censored domains during this period and the adjacent ones (as well
as the corresponding percentage of censored volume each domain
represents). It is evident that skype is being heavily blocked (up
to 29% of the censored trafﬁc), probably due to the protests that
happened in Syria on August 3, 2011. However, 9% of the requests
to Skype servers are related to update attempts (for Windows clients)
and all of them are denied. There is also an unusually higher number
of requests to MSN live messenger service (through msn.com),
thus suggesting that the censorship activity peaks might perhaps
be correlated to high demand targeting Instant Messaging software
websites.8 In conclusion, censorship peaks might be due to sudden
higher volumes of trafﬁc targeting Skype and MSN live messenger
websites, which are being systematically censored by the proxies.
5.2 Comparing different proxies
We now compare the behavior of the 7 different proxies whose
logs are included in our datasets. In Fig. 7(a), we plot the trafﬁc
distribution across proxies, restricted to two days (August 3 and 4) to
ease presentation. Note that the load is fairly distributed among the
proxies, however, if one only considers censored trafﬁc (Fig. 7(b)),
different behaviors become evident. In particular, Proxy SG-48 is
responsible for a large proportion of the censored trafﬁc, especially
at certain times. One possible explanation is that different proxies
follow different policies, or there could be a high proportion of
censored (or likely to be censored) trafﬁc being redirected to proxy
SG-48 during one speciﬁc period of time.
We also consider the top-10 censored domain names in the period
of time August 3 (12am)–August 4 (12am) and observe that the
domain metacafe.com is always censored and that almost all re-
lated requests (more than 95%) are processed only by proxy SG-48.
This might be due to a domain-based trafﬁc redirection process: in
fact, we observed a very similar behavior for skype.com during the
censorship peaks analysis presented earlier in Section 5.1.
We also look at the categories distribution of all requests across
the different proxies and concentrate on two categories, “Unavail-
able” and “None”, which show a peculiar distribution across the
proxies (recall that categories have been discussed in Section 4).
We note that the “None” category is only observed on two different
proxies (SG-43 and SG-48), while “Unavailable” is less frequently
observed on these two. This suggests either different conﬁguration
of the proxies or a content specialization of the proxies.
For more details on the comparison between proxies, and an
evaluation of the similarity between censored requests handled by

sorship activity, we show in Fig. 5(b) the temporal evolution of the
number of censored (resp., allowed) requests at speciﬁc times of the
day, normalized by the total number of censored (resp., allowed)
requests. Note that the two curves are not comparable, but illustrate
the relative activity when considering the overall nature of the trafﬁc
over the observation period. The relative censorship activity exhibits
a few peaks, with a higher volume of censored content on particular
periods of time. There are also two sudden “drops” in both allowed
and censored requests, which might be correlated to some protests
that day.7 There is a visible reduction in trafﬁc from Thursday after-
noon (August 4) to Friday (August 5), consistent with press reports
of Internet connections being slowed almost every Friday “when the
big weekly protests are staged” [21].
To further study the activity peaks, we zoom in on one speciﬁc day
(August 3) that has a particularly high volume of censored trafﬁc.
Let RCV (Relative Censored trafﬁc Volume) be the ratio between
the number of censored requests at a time frame (with a 5-minute
granularity) and the total number of requests received on the same
time frame; in Fig. 6, we plot RCV as a function of the time of day.
There are a few sharp increases in censored trafﬁc, with the fraction
of censored content increasing from 1% to 2% of the total trafﬁc
around 8am, while, around 9.30am, the RCV variation exhibits a
