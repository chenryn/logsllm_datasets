### Describe the problem
After successfully building TensorFlow with GPU support, I'm trying to build
the pip package and I'm getting an error saying it can't read the
simple_console_for_windows.zip file.
I've confirmed that the file is in C:\tensorflow\bazel-
bin\tensorflow\tools\pip_package folder, but it is 0 bytes.
This is my pip build command:  
bazel-bin\tensorflow\tools\pip_package\build_pip_package C:/tmp/tensorflow_pkg
My build command was:  
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda
//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
