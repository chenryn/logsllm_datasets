User: How do you add logging to a web service for troubleshooting and monitoring?
Assistant: To add a log function to a web service for troubleshooting and monitoring, follow the steps below: 1. Determine the log level that needs to be recorded: generally choose to record error and warning information, or select a more detailed level, such as debug mode. 2. Select an appropriate log framework: common log frameworks include Log4j, Logback, etc., select a framework suitable for the project, and configure the path and format of the log output. 3. Add log statements to the code: Add log statements to the code to record information that needs to be tracked, such as exception information, business logic processing information, and so on. 4. Set log rotation: If the log file is too large, it needs to be rotated regularly, otherwise it will affect the performance of the system and occupy storage space. 5. Link to the monitoring system: Linking logs to the monitoring system allows administrators to more easily track exceptions and monitor system status. Through the above steps, the log function can be added to the web service, which is convenient for troubleshooting and monitoring.
