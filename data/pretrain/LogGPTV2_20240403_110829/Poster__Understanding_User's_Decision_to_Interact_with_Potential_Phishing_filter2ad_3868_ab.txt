We recruited 20 participants for this study—10 men with an
average age of 23 and 10 women with an average age of 24. All
of them were students at the Rochester Institute of Technology
(undergraduates: 7, graduate students: 13). Each participant was
compensated with a $10 Amazon.com gift card at the end of the
session.
4 Findings
In this section, we report the results from our study. Due to a small
sample size, we did not conduct any significance tests.
Our results show that the closer the relationship with the post-
author, the higher the likelihood of clicking on a post. As shown in
Figure 1a, posts shared by Spouse/Partner scored an average of 5.3
(on a 7-point Likert-scale), while the posts shared by Public Pages
scored an average of 4.2. Furthermore, since all relationship types
scored similarly on the frequency of their posting (between ‘at least
once a day’ and ‘at least once a week’), our results demonstrate
that the closeness of relationship with post-author plays a role on
users’ clicking decisions.
In regards to the place of posting, our results show that when the
post is shared in a location that is more noticeable to the user (e.g.,
the user’s wall, the author’s wall with the user tagged, and the user’s
inbox), the user is more likely to click. As shown in Figure 1b, posts
shared on the author’s wall (with tagging) scored an average of 5.1,
posts shared on user’s wall and in the messenger (i.e., inbox) scored
an average of 4.7, while posts shared on author’s wall (without
tagging) scored the lowest: 3.8. This result differs slightly from
our previous work, where we did not find any differences between
the scenarios [12]. However, our new findings make more sense,
since the locations that scored higher usually result in a notification
that alerts the users to the post. Furthermore, when authors post
on a user’s wall, tag her in a post, or send her a private message,
they are directly inviting her to interact with the post and start a
conversation. Therefore, users are more inclined to click on such
posts.
Figure 1c shows the effect of the type of the post. Sales-oriented
posts scored the lowest with an average of 3.5 compared to inter-
active (4.5) and media posts (6.7). In previous work [12], we used

a different set of categories for the type of post (travel, news, and
entertainment) which did not yield a noticeable difference in the
likelihood score. In this regard, the new categories that we used in
this study offer better distinctions.
In the survey, we asked participants to report how likely the
person in each relationship is to share each type of post in real life.
We then measured the likelihood of participants to click on a post
that is similar to (or different from) the type of posts the author
is more likely to share. We found a positive correlation between
the likelihood of a post-author to share a particular type of post
and the likelihood of the user to click on such a post shared by
that author (see Figure 2). For example, if a participant reports that
her spouse is more likely to share a media post, then she is more
likely to click on a media post than the sale-oriented or interactive
posts shared by her spouse. Similarly, participants are more likely
to click on a post that they expect to be shared by a public page (e.g.,
sale-oriented page sharing a sales related post) than a relatively
unexpected post, like a media page sharing a sales-related post.
We found a weak negative correlation between the likelihood of
clicking on a post and the difference in post type from what is likely
to be shared by a post-author (see Figure 2). This means, if the users
encounter a post that they believe are not usually shared by the
post-author, they are less likely to interact with them. However they
are not strongly discouraged or deterred by this kind of mismatch.

5 Conclusions
In this vignette study, we have explored the relationship between
whether users will click on a social media post and the attributes of
the post, including who posts it, where it is posted, and the type of
post. Attackers seeking to phish users on Facebook likely leverage
this kind of information to craft their attacks, so it is important to
understand for designing mechanisms to protect users.
