### Effort to Clean Up and Release Options

To address the issue, customers have several release options available. The second option is to seek assistance from the ISP's abuse staff to restore the connection. Customers may require this assisted release if they no longer have the self-release option or if they have contacted the ISP for help. Quarantined customers can contact the abuse desk via email, through the walled garden form, or by calling the regular help desk. The third option is a time-out release, where customers are automatically released after 30 days, even if they have not contacted the ISP.

### Study Design

To understand the impact of notifications on the remediation process of Mirai-infected devices, we designed a study consisting of two stages: (i) an observational study on walled garden notifications conducted by the ISP over four months, and (ii) a randomized controlled experiment to assess the impact of an improved notification tailored to IoT infection remediation. Figure 2 illustrates the timeline of both studies. Additionally, to gain insights into Mirai infection dynamics, we conducted a series of tests with real vulnerable devices.

### Data Sources

To identify and track infected Mirai devices in the ISP network, we utilized a combination of several data sources. Table II provides a high-level summary.

1. **Daily Shadowserver Abuse Feeds**: The Shadowserver Foundation, a non-profit security organization, gathers and distributes data on abused Internet resources. We used their daily reports sent to our partner ISP, in combination with other data sources, to detect and track Mirai-infected users. During the study period, 658 IP addresses were detected as infected, and we selected 349 of these for our study. These 349 IP addresses correspond to 343 different subscribers, with 6 subscribers having non-static IP addresses during the study period.

2. **IoT Honeypot**: An additional data source for detecting and tracking infected devices are the daily log files of a low-interaction honeypot running the open-source IoTPOT software. This IoT-specific honeypot emulates various well-known vulnerable network services. The honeypot was deployed over 738 IP addresses across three countries, including the country where the partner ISP operates. During the study, the honeypot captured 512 different IP addresses belonging to the partner ISP. Although the ISP only relies on Shadowserver feeds for notifications, we used the honeypot data to track infections along with the darknet.

3. **Darknet**: A third data source for detection and tracking is the darknet. We monitored 16 protocols known to be abused by Mirai botnets for the network ranges operated by the partner ISP. The darknet data is more granular than the honeypot and Shadowserver data, making it useful for measuring the time to remediation.

4. **Censys Scans**: Censys is a platform that scans the IPv4 space and aggregates application layer data about hosts on the Internet. We obtained raw scan data for 49 Internet-wide scans, focusing on specific ports and protocols between May 1, 2017, and April 31, 2018.

5. **Nmap Scans**: We used the Nmap network scanner tool to enrich the dataset for device identification. Once a device was identified as infected, we scanned it to obtain a list of open ports and banner information. We scanned 349 IP addresses, though 67 were already offline at the time of the scan.

### Treatment Variables

Our studies aim to determine the impact of different notification mechanisms on remediation. We compare two experimental treatments using different notification methods (walled garden and email-only) to a control group where no notifications were made during the experiment period. We also improved the standard ISP notification message to provide more actionable advice to users. Figure 2 summarizes the different treatment groups compared across the two studies. We now examine the two main treatment variables: notification method and notification content.

1. **Notification Method**:
   - **Email**: Commonly used by ISPs due to its cost-effectiveness and scalability. However, it is uncertain whether the email is read in a timely manner or classified as spam.
   - **Walled Garden**: Notifications within the quarantine environment are more likely to be read by users. The quarantining provides a strong incentive for remediation, but self-release and assisted-release options do not guarantee successful cleanup.

2. **Notification Content**:
   - Crafting usable security notifications is challenging. We collaborated with the ISP to improve the standard notification content, avoiding technical jargon and organizing the remediation steps in a numbered series. We also added steps to reset the router, close all ports, and disable DMZ and UPnP.

### Study Procedure

The study consisted of two stages. The first stage was an observational study of the existing ISP walled garden mechanism, conducted from June 2017 to October 2017. The second stage was a randomized controlled experiment from November 2017 to April 2018. We determined the total sample size using a power calculation and randomly assigned 40 users to each treatment group (walled garden, email-only, and control). The control group was notified 14 days later for ethical reasons.

### Tracking the Infected Hosts

Assessing the cleanup status of an IoT device remotely is challenging. The fact that IP addresses disappear from the infection data does not necessarily mean the device is clean. We also tracked reinfections and long-term efficacy of remediation, as well as the influence of device type on cleanup.

### Impact of Notification Mechanism

We determined the impact of notifications on remediation by comparing the experimental groups. The top of Table III shows the percentage of IoT devices remediated 14 days after the initial notification and the median infection time for each group. The control group achieved the lowest cleanup rate (74%), followed closely by the email-only treatment group (77%). The improved walled garden notifications resulted in a 92% remediation rate and a substantially shorter median infection time (26 hours compared to 66 hours for the control group).

**Figure 6a: Survival Probabilities for Different Groups**

The log-rank test shows a significant difference between the control group and the improved walled garden treatment group (χ² = 4.4, p = 0.0359), providing evidence that quarantining is effective, while email notifications have little impact.
