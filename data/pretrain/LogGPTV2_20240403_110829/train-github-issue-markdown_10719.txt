  * Electron version: v1.6.9
  * Operating system: Arch Linux with Gnome as DE
### Expected behavior
NativeImage does not support SVG images :( I've to convert the images to png's
and there's no easy way to doing so (use external libraries that almost every
one of them requires PhantomJs...)
Every Linux distro supports using SVG icons for Tray icons. And so should
nativeImage on Linux desktop.
### Actual behavior
Doesn't work as SVG icons are not supported
### How to reproduce
    const nativeImage = require('electron').nativeImage
    let image = nativeImage.createFromPath('/Users/somebody/images/icon.svg')
    console.log(image)
The reason why I need this is that I've created a simple package to look for
an icon on current icon theme used by the user. This way, electron
applications can look more native with tray icons that can be themed by any
theme designer (without any hackish solution like extracting the user file...)  
And every icon theme on Linux is using SVG icons. I hope this convince you
enough to make this happenüëç
