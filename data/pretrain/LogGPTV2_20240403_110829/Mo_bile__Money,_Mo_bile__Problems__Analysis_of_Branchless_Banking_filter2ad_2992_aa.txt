## Abstract
Mobile money, or branchless banking, provides essential financial services to unbanked populations in the developing world. These services leverage ubiquitous cellular networks and are increasingly being deployed as smartphone applications, offering an electronic payment infrastructure where traditional options like credit cards are often unavailable. While marketed as a more secure alternative to cash, these applications frequently lack the regulatory oversight typical in the financial sector, raising concerns about their security. In this paper, we evaluate these claims through the first in-depth measurement analysis of branchless banking applications.

We begin with an automated analysis of all 46 known Android mobile money apps across 246 providers, which reveals that automated tools provide limited insights. We then conduct a comprehensive manual teardown of the registration, login, and transaction procedures for a diverse 15% of these apps. Our findings uncover pervasive and systemic vulnerabilities, including flawed certificate validation, DIY cryptography, and various forms of information leakage. These issues allow attackers to impersonate users, modify transactions, and steal financial records, confirming that many of these apps fail to provide the necessary protections for financial services. Additionally, we examine the terms of service and find that liability for these problems often rests unfairly on the customer, potentially eroding trust in branchless banking and hindering efforts for global financial inclusion.

## 1. Introduction
Modern commerce in developed economies relies heavily on cashless payment systems, enabling rapid, large-scale financial transactions that drive economic growth. However, in many developing countries, physical currency remains the primary means of exchange due to a lack of access to modern financial services.

Branchless banking applications aim to fill this gap by leveraging the widespread deployment of cellular networks and mobile devices. These systems, often provided by non-traditional financial entities like telecommunications companies, allow users to deposit, transfer, and withdraw funds through a network of independent vendors. Over the past decade, these systems have significantly improved the standard of living in many developing nations, with some handling more transactions per month than established payment processors like PayPal.

One of the key selling points of these applications is their perceived security. Unlike carrying large amounts of cash, which can be dangerous, branchless banking is marketed as a secure method for conducting commercial transactions. However, the technical robustness of these claims has not been publicly verified. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive security analysis of branchless banking applications.

### Contributions
- **Comprehensive Security Analysis:** We perform the first in-depth security analysis of branchless banking applications, combining automated and manual techniques.
- **Systemic Vulnerabilities Identified:** Our analysis uncovers pervasive weaknesses, including flawed certificate validation, DIY cryptography, and information leakage, which compromise the integrity of transactions.
- **Liability Analysis:** We examine the terms of service and find that customers often bear the liability for fraudulent activities, highlighting significant financial risks for users.

## 2. Mobile Money in the Developing World
Lack of access to basic financial services is a major contributor to poverty worldwide. Millions of people, especially in rural areas, do not have access to banks, making it difficult to save, conduct remote transactions, or protect their money from theft. Mobile money systems, such as M-Pesa in Kenya, offer a promising solution by providing financial services through mobile phone networks.

M-Pesa, one of the most impactful mobile money systems, allows users to send money, pay bills, and check account balances using SMS or a special application menu. This system does not require a pre-existing relationship with a bank, effectively creating an alternative banking infrastructure in areas where traditional banking is impractical or non-existent.

Mobile money has become ubiquitous and essential, with M-Pesa boasting over 18.2 million registrations in Kenya alone. As of August 2014, there were 246 mobile money services in 88 countries, serving over 203 million registered accounts. The security of these systems is crucial for maintaining trust and preventing fraud.

### 2.1 Comparison to Other Services
Mobile money shares functionalities with other mobile finance systems but differs in its communication methods and independence from existing banking infrastructure. Figure 2 illustrates the overlap between mobile payments, mobile wallets, and branchless banking systems.

- **Mobile Payments:** Systems like PayPal, Google Wallet, and Apple Pay act as intermediaries for existing credit card or bank accounts.
- **Mobile Wallets:** Store multiple payment credentials and facilitate promotional offers, discounts, and loyalty programs.
- **Branchless Banking:** Designed for easy inclusion, with minimal enrollment requirements, low transaction fees, and reduced "Know Your Customer" (KYC) regulations. These systems often use SMS, USSD, or IVR for transactions, which can be vulnerable to attacks.

## 3. App Selection and Analysis
### 3.1 Mallodroid Analysis
Using data from the GSMA Mobile Money Tracker, we identified 47 Android mobile money apps across 28 countries. We performed an automated analysis using Mallodroid, a static analysis tool for detecting SSL/TLS vulnerabilities. Table 3 in the appendix lists the apps and their static analysis results. While Mallodroid detected vulnerabilities in 24 apps, it only provides a basic indicator and cannot detect major design flaws or ecosystem vulnerabilities.

### 3.2 App Selection
We selected seven mobile money apps for extensive manual analysis, representing 15% of the total applications. These apps were chosen to reflect diversity in markets, providers, features, download counts, and static analysis results. Collectively, they serve millions of users across five countries (Figure 3).

### 3.3 Manual Analysis Process
Our analysis involved two phases: an initial inspection phase and a reverse engineering phase.

#### Phase 1: Inspection
- **Application Manifest:** We used apktool to obtain the manifest, identifying app components and permissions.
- **Dalvik Bytecode Disassembly:** We disassembled the application dex file using Baksmali to identify classes and libraries.
- **Package Identification:** We manually noted all included packages and external libraries.
- **SSL/TLS Endpoint Testing:** We used the Qualys SSL Server Test to check the security of the app's SSL endpoints.

#### Phase 2: Reverse Engineering
- **Code Analysis:** We analyzed the app's code to understand its behavior and client/server protocols.
- **Execution and Verification:** For apps with created accounts, we executed the app and verified our findings.

Our focus was on verifying the integrity of financial transactions, particularly in communications between the app and backend systems, where adversaries can observe, modify, or generate transactions.

## 4. Findings
Our analysis uncovered several critical vulnerabilities, including:
- **Flawed Certificate Validation:** Many apps failed to properly validate server certificates, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **DIY Cryptography:** Some apps implemented custom cryptographic solutions, which were often insecure.
- **Information Leakage:** Sensitive information was often transmitted in plaintext or with weak encryption, leading to potential data breaches.

These findings confirm that the majority of the analyzed apps do not provide the necessary security for financial services.

## 5. Liability Analysis
We examined the terms of service for the apps and found that customers often bear the liability for fraudulent activities. This unfair distribution of risk threatens to erode trust in branchless banking and hinder efforts for global financial inclusion.

## 6. Discussion and Recommendations
To address the identified vulnerabilities, we recommend:
- **Improved Certificate Validation:** Apps should implement robust certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Standardized Cryptography:** Use well-established cryptographic libraries instead of custom solutions.
- **Data Encryption:** Ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted using strong, industry-standard algorithms.
- **Regulatory Oversight:** Increase regulatory oversight to ensure that branchless banking applications meet the same security standards as traditional financial services.

## 7. Related Work
We discuss relevant related work, including previous studies on mobile payment systems and security analyses of financial applications.

## 8. Conclusion
This paper provides the first comprehensive security analysis of branchless banking applications, revealing significant vulnerabilities and unfair liability practices. Addressing these issues is crucial for maintaining trust and promoting financial inclusion in the developing world.
