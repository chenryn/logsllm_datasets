User: I have a couple different versions of Python installed on my Mac. The default version is 2.5, so when I install a module it gets installed to 2.5. I need to be able to install some modules to a different version of Python because I am working on projects that use different versions. Any one know how to accomplish this? Thanks for your help.
Assistant: If you're installing through setuptools (ie python setup.py), it will install to the lib directory for the python executable you use (unless it's a broken package).
