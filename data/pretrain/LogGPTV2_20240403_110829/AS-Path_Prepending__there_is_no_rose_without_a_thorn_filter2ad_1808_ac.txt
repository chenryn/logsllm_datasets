50% of prefix-origin pairs using the uniform policy. Since there is no
guarantee that these are the same prefixes, we look into it further.
Between January 1st, 2018, and May 4th, 2020, we observe 1.16M
prefix-origin pairs in our BGPWeekly dataset. Out of these, 108k
prefixes are uniformly prepended in at least one snapshot, and 3.4k
(originated by 1.1k ASes) use this policy the entire time—henceforth
referred to as consistently uniform. We also note that another 13.1k
(originated by 4.3k ASes) are uniformly prepended for at least one
year, continuously. Thus, counter-intuitively, we find that a sub-
stantial number of ASes, roughly 6% on the Internet, are making
consistent use of uniform prepending.

Uniform prefix prepending is dominated by small ASes.
How large are those interesting cases of ASes uniformly prepending
all their prefixes? To answer this question, we determine the total
number of prefixes each of these ASes originate. Taking May 4th,
2020, as an example, there were 848 (out of 1717) ASes with only
a single prefix. Another 767 ASes originated between 2 and 10
prefixes, and 89 ASes, between 11 and 50. The remaining 13 ASes
originated more than 50 prefixes, all of them uniformly prepended,
with the largest one originating 379 prefixes. Among the larger ASes
(with 50+ prefixes), we identified a large online social network, two
universities, and several ISPs. These ASes are from North America,
South America, and Asia.
We then check for how long these ASes used the uniform policy.
We find that 6k ASes (out of 74k that we observe when combining all
snapshots) uniformly prepend all prefixes in at least one snapshot,
and 263 ASes used this policy between January 1st, 2018, and May
4th, 2020. We also see that other 716 ASes uniformly prepended all
their prefixes for at least one year. From the group of 13 ASes that on
May 4th, 2020, were uniformly prepending all of their 50+ prefixes,
we find the following: one AS used it at least since January 1st, 2018,
five for at least the past two years, one for the past 22 months, three
for at least one year. The others consecutively prepended between
2 and 5 months.
We account for potential artifacts when measuring uni-
form prepending. Even though our sanitation ensures global visi-
bility of all prefixes, missing interconnections may cause prefixes
to incorrectly appear as uniformly prepended. There might be ad-
ditional private network interconnects and peering links that are
not visible to the BGP monitoring infrastructure [16, 47, 74]. We
use two different approaches for cross-checking the results. First,
we use bdrmapIT [40], a state-of-the-art tool, to infer intercon-
nections based on public traceroutes from CAIDA’s Archipelago
(Ark) [12] between March 25th, 2020 and April 4th, 2020. We picked
Ark traceroutes as it contains measurements to each /24 sub prefix
from multiple vantage points. We then compare the list of intercon-
nections from bdrmapIT with the ones we observe in our snapshot
from March 30th, 2020 (the mid-point of our traceroutes). On our
reference date (March 30th, 2020), 5.8k ASes were originating at
least one prefix uniformly prepended. With bdrmapIT, we identify
additional interconnection links for 1.7k (29%) of these ASes. Nev-
ertheless, for the other 71% ASes originating uniformly prepended
prefixes, bdrmapIT did not add any additional links. For the 263
ASes that uniformly prepended all their prefixes in all snapshots of
the BGPWeekly dataset, we identify new links for only 18 of them.
We note that even though we identify new links, we cannot draw
any inference regarding the BGP announcements made through
those links.
The second cross-check is to increase our visibility into the BGP
routing system with data from two large global CDNs (each con-
nected to more than 200 peering infrastructures) and one regional
CDN present in more than 25 peering infrastructures. We choose
CDNs since they have many private peering interconnections and
need excellent visibility within the routing system for their opera-
tions. When checking their private data for all prefixes uniformly
prepended in all snapshots of the BGPWeekly dataset, we observe
more diverse policies for only 51 of those prefixes. Thus, we can
conclude that our inferences are valid for the vast majority of the
uniform cases.
Some of these prefixes carry large volumes of traffic. Some
operators mentioned that consistently uniformly prepended pre-
fixes might only carry little traffic, reducing the need to care about
them. To check this hypothesis, we use a large European IXP as
our vantage point on April 28th, 2020. We check the traffic volumes
to and from each of the consistently uniformly prepended prefixes
and observe that some of them carry as much traffic as prefixes of
large social networks.9
To provide a picture of the traffic associated with all consistently
uniformly prepended prefixes in our vantage point, Figure 8 shows
the fraction of bytes flowing towards each prefix (as well as in both
directions) relative to the prefix with the most significant amount of
traffic. For 57% of the prefixes, we do not observe any traffic towards
them, and for 35%, we observe traffic from them, but not towards
them. We note that only a few prefixes (<2%) carry representative
volumes of traffic, either considering one or both directions. The
vast majority of the prefixes we observe carry small volumes of
traffic. While we cannot guarantee that other vantage points would
observe similar numbers, we can conclude that, contrary to network
operators’ intuition, some of the consistently uniformly prepended
prefixes carry substantial traffic volumes.
Many plausible causes for uniform prepending. Is there
any practical explanation for the use of uniform prepending? We in-
vestigate this aspect by interviewing network operators, and report
here a summary of potential causes: Loss of a neighbor: an AS may
have used ASPP to differentiate between multiple upstreams but
later terminated the relationship with some. Indeed, we observe
that many (77% on May 4th, 2020) of the uniformly prepended
prefixes are propagated via a single neighbor. Lack of knowledge:
A reoccurring opinion is that many network operators, especially
from small ASes, have limited understanding of BGP. Indeed, our
analysis showed that many of the cases of uniform prepending were
from small ASes. Procrastination for stability: Some network opera-
tors know about the presence of ASPP but are reluctant to remove
it, out of fear of negatively affecting their reachability and/or rout-
ing stability in general. Good news travels fast—bad news, slowly:
Some operators indicated that uniform prepending may help im-
plement ITE policies when needed quickly. Instead of waiting to
insert prepends when some change is needed, an AS can prepend
in advance, and when the time comes, remove from one upstream
to indicate a preferred route. Since “good news” travel fast, such
an approach provides faster BGP convergence. Sibling artifacts:
One operator pointed out that there might be cases in which two
or more sibling ASes originate the same prefix, but with different
prepending policies. We analyze this possibility using the CAIDA
AS2Org dataset [14] and the data from May 4th, 2020. We find 17
cases in which two or more sibling ASes individually announced
the same prefix, one uniformly prepended and the other with a
different policy, resulting in a non-uniform policy. Strikingly, in 16
out of 17 cases, one of the ASes announces using uniform and the
other one with a different policy. In one case, both ASes originate
the prefix uniformly prepended, but with different prepending sizes.
Other ASes ignoring prepends: One operator argued that uniform

prepending might even lead to the desired traffic shift due to route-
optimizers ignoring all prepends on one upstream and not on the
others.
Looking at two relevant cases of uniform prepending. To
validate our observations and to understand some of the actual
reasons why ASes uniformly prepend their prefixes, we reached
out to network operators from two ASes that have been originating
uniformly prepended prefixes for more than one year.10 One is a
regional ISP that uniformly prepends 25 prefixes (out of 100+), while
the other is a large online social network uniformly prepending
all its 80+ prefixes. The operators from the regional ISP confirmed
that the uniform prepending was unintentional and attributed it to
legacy configurations and changes to their upstreams. The large
online social network also confirmed that they were using uniform
prepending unintentionally: the prepends are a result of how their
internal routing platform operates. Since then, none of these ASes
have removed the uniform prepends.
5.4 Prepending sizes
We use the BGPMonthly dataset to track if ASes changed the num-
ber of prepends they use over time. Since different service regions
have distinct characteristics (e.g., availability of peering infrastruc-
tures [68]), we analyze them individually. We use the delegation
files from the Routing Information Registries (RIRs) to identify the
prefix region. While we acknowledge that there might be some
misclassification, e.g., for global ASes, transferred prefixes, or due
to IPv4 address delegations, we expect it to provide valid data for
most prefixes. For each prefix, we analyze its minimum (non-zero)
and maximum prepend size, i.e., if an ASes originates a prefix with
0, 2, and 3 prepends, its minimum prepended size is 2, and its maxi-
mum is 3. Figure 9 shows the results as a set of subplots, one for
each service region and year. Each subplot shows a histogram for
both the minimum (green) and maximum (purple) prepend sizes
10We note that not all ASes are interested in discussing aspects of their operational
practices. While discussing with network operators might not be enough for general-
ization, their comments allow us to provide insights regarding uniformly prepended
prefixes.
across all prepended prefixes. The blue bars represent the overlap
between the green and the purple bars.
Prepending sizes are polarized and consistent among re-
gions. We observe that the prepending size distributions for ARIN
and RIPE, which hardly change during the decade, are polarized:
most prefixes either have a prepending size of one or at least four.11
LACNIC and AFRINIC are different: in 2010, there is no polarization,
with a substantial number of prefixes with at least four prepends,
while in 2020 polarization happens with a more significant inci-
dence of prepending of size one. The change happens gradually
over time, but in AFRINIC, the period 2014–2017 was an exception:
prepending sizes varied “rapidly” and somewhat unpredictably.
Towards 2020, the observable differences between the service re-
gions become negligible—they are all polarized. In APNIC, the span
between max and min prepend sizes increased, indicating more
polarization, with an even more fine-grained set of prepending
policies.
When we discussed these results with operators, they pointed
out that the Internet infrastructure changed significantly through-
out the decade, particularly for LACNIC and AFRINIC. Before 2015,
many routes within Africa took long inter-continental detours [30].
In order to use intra-continental paths whenever possible, ASes
resorted to excessive prepending. With the increased availability of
IXPs and peering within each region, intra-continental path diver-
sity increased [24]. This may have reduced the need for excessive
prepending, thus reducing prepend sizes.
6 EVALUATING ASPP EFFECTIVENESS
Given the widespread use of ASPP, in this section we explore the
propagation of prepended routes and how effective ASPP is today.
Prepended paths propagate less than non-prepended ones.
The common assumption is that the larger the prepend size of a
route is, the less a network operator will expect it to propagate.
Thus, prepending should mainly affect routing in the local neighbor-
hood of an AS. To investigate how prepended prefixes propagate,
11In July 2019, we spot an AS originating four prefixes with 905 prepends, which is
the maximum number of prepends we observe in our datasets.

we analyze all prefixes with a binary prepending policy where the
prefix originator has not prepended one of the alternatives. For
each prefix, we compute the fraction of ASes (out of those that
we observe propagating the prefix) that propagate each alterna-
tive. Figure 10 shows the results for May 4th, 2020 (we observe
a similar behavior for other snapshots). We observe that in 70%
of the analyzed cases, independently from the prepend size, the
prepended alternative traverses fewer ASes than the non-prepended
one. While it may seem that the prepend size has no direct effect
on route propagation, a more plausible explanation is that the ASes
are tuning their prepend size to control how far the prefixes can
propagate. Figure 10 shows that the distributions of the intended
scopes of propagation are quite similar for different prepending
sizes.
Nevertheless, it is unclear to which extent the adoption of a
prepended path impacts the actual traffic flow, since (a) different
routers in an AS may pick different preferred paths, (b) BGP mon-
itors cover only a subset of ASes, and (c) some ASes might even
remove ASPP (see § 7.1). Thus, we run active measurement ex-
periments using the PEERING testbed as our vantage point. The
PEERING testbed offers unique possibilities for our experiments.
First, it operates on a geographically diverse set of locations—we
refer to each location as Point of Presence (PoP). Second, each PoP
has a diverse set of upstreams—the number of upstreams and the
degree of connectivity of the individual upstreams differ among
PoPs. Third, the PEERING testbed allows us to originate probing
traffic towards a diverse set of targets using ICMP, TCP, and UDP.
On an abstract level, we create a scenario where we announce
