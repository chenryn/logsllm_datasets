## Abstract
Active probing techniques, such as ping, are commonly used to detect network outages. When a previously responsive end host fails to respond to a probe, studies often attempt to confirm the outage by retrying the ping or using other tools like traceroute. A critical issue is determining the appropriate timeout for a response. A too-short timeout can confuse congestion or other delays with an outage, while a too-long timeout can slow the process and prevent the observation of short-duration events.

We argue that conventional timeouts for active probes are underestimated and analyze data collected by Heidemann et al. from 2006 to 2015. Our analysis reveals that 5% of pings from 5% of addresses take more than 5 seconds. This means that if a 5-second timeout is used, a false 5% loss rate would be inferred for 5% of the responsive IP addresses. We filtered out artifacts, including responses to broadcast addresses, and analyzed ICMP data collected by Zmap in 2015, finding that around 5% of all responsive addresses consistently observe a round-trip time greater than one second. Additionally, we observed that high round-trip times are increasing and are often associated with the first ping, possibly due to negotiating wireless connections. The Autonomous Systems with the most high-latency addresses are typically cellular. This paper presents our analysis and results, which suggest that researchers should set longer timeouts when necessary and report on timeout settings in future measurements.

## 1. Introduction
Active probes, such as the echo requests sent by ping, are used to study network reliability. A path to a destination is considered functional if the ping is successful, and an outage is detected if a previously responsive destination stops responding to successive probes. However, the optimal timeout for a response is not well understood. Protocols like TCP and DNS use timeouts near three seconds, and various tools use similar thresholds. For example, iPlane uses 2 seconds with one retry, Trinocular uses 3 seconds, and Scriptroute defaults to 3-second timeouts. While TCP and DNS can tolerate longer delays, network measurements that timeout quickly may misinterpret delayed responses as outages.

In this paper, we investigate the appropriate timeout for active probing. We analyze ping latencies from Internet-wide surveys conducted by ISI, including 9.64 billion ICMP Echo Responses from 4 million different IP addresses in 2015. The survey sets a 3-second timeout, but we re-process the data to identify responses that took longer than this threshold. We classify unmatched responses into three categories: (a) delayed responses potentially caused by congestion, (b) responses triggered by later requests sent to broadcast addresses, and (c) duplicate responses. We then verify these high latencies using other probing techniques and investigate the high-latency behavior of ICMP compared to UDP and TCP. Finally, we explain these distributions by isolating satellite links and classifying a complete sample of the Internet address space through a modified Zmap client. The Autonomous Systems with the most high-latency addresses are found to be cellular.

## 2. Importance of Probe Timeouts
### 2.1 Selecting a Timeout
Conventional wisdom suggests that active probes on the Internet should timeout after a few seconds. If a probe experiences a timeout, it is generally assumed that the probe is lost or the end-host is no longer reachable. Most active probing systems follow up with retransmissions to increase confidence that a lack of response is due to a lack of reachability. However, non-responses within a timeout can occur for reasons other than the host being offline. A too-low timeout value can ignore delayed responses and add to congestion, while a too-high timeout can delay retransmissions and increase the state that needs to be maintained at the prober.

### 2.2 Timeouts Used in Outage and Connectivity Studies
Outage detection systems like Trinocular and Thunderping use a 3-second timeout for active probes, based on the default TCP SYN/ACK timeout. Trinocular probes all /24s on the Internet and performs adaptive retransmission, sending up to 15 additional probes before declaring an outage. Thunderping sends ICMP echo requests to IP addresses likely to be affected by severe weather and retransmits probes ten times before declaring a host unresponsive. Internet performance monitoring systems use a wide range of probe timeouts, from 2 seconds (iPlane and Hubble) to one hour (Feamster et al.). RIPE Atlas and SamKnows use 1-second and 3-second timeouts, respectively, for their probing hardware.

## 3. Primary Dataset Overview
### 3.1 Raw ISI Survey Data
ISI has conducted Internet-wide surveys since 2006, sending ICMP echo request probes to approximately 24,000 /24 address blocks every 11 minutes for two weeks. We use data from 103 surveys taken between April 2006 and February 2015, focusing on the most recent surveys in January and February 2015. The dataset includes all echo requests and responses received within, typically, three seconds.

### 3.2 Preliminary Analysis
We aggregate round trip time measurements per IP address, focusing on the median, 80th, 90th, 95th, 98th, and 99th percentile latencies. Figure 1 shows a CDF of these percentile values, indicating that 95% of echo replies from 95% of addresses arrive in less than 2.85 seconds. However, the distribution is clipped at the 3-second mark, with a few responses matched even after 7 seconds.

### 3.3 Unmatched Responses
If a probe takes more than three seconds to receive a response, it appears as if the probe timed out, and the response is unmatched. We match these responses to construct the complete distribution of round trip times. Two causes of unexpected responses are identified: unmatched responses solicited by echo requests sent to broadcast addresses and apparent denial of service responses. We develop filters to remove these unexpected responses from the set of unmatched responses.

#### 3.3.1 Broadcast Responses
The dataset contains instances where a ping to a destination times out, but is followed by an unmatched response. These broadcast responses and other unexpected responses are filtered out to ensure accurate latency analysis.

## 4. Key Results
Our key results show how long a timeout must be to capture a high percentage of responses from a high percentage of hosts. We find that 5% of pings from 5% of addresses take more than 5 seconds, suggesting that a 5-second timeout is insufficient for 5% of the responsive IP addresses. This highlights the need for longer timeouts in certain scenarios.

## 5. Verification of Latencies
We verify the high latencies by repeating measurements using other probing techniques, comparing statistics from various surveys, and investigating high-latency behavior of ICMP compared to UDP and TCP. We also isolate satellite links and consider sequences of latencies at a higher sampling rate.

## 6. Identifying High-Latency Networks
We focus on identifying the networks and behaviors responsible for high latencies. The Autonomous Systems with the most high-latency addresses are typically cellular, indicating that these networks may require special consideration in setting timeouts.

## 7. Conclusion and Recommendations
We conclude with recommendations for researchers to set longer timeouts when needed and to report on timeout settings in future measurements. This will help in accurately detecting outages and understanding network reliability.
