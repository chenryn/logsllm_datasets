ABSTRACT
In traditional access control systems, security administrators de-
termine whether an information consumer can access a certain re-
source. However, in reality, it is very difﬁcult for policy makers
to foresee what information a user may need in various situation-
s.
In hospitals, failing to authorize a doctor for the medical in-
formation she needs about a patient could lead to severe or fatal
consequences. In this paper, we propose a practical access control
approach to protect patient privacy in health information systems
by taking the realities in healthcare into consideration. First, un-
like traditional access control systems, our proposed access con-
trol model allows information consumers (i.e. doctors) to make
access decisions, while still being able to detect and control the
over-accessing of patients’ medical data by quantifying the risk as-
sociated with doctors’ data-accessing activities. Second, we do not
require doctors to do anything special in order to use our system.
We learn about common practices among doctors and apply sta-
tistical methods and information theory techniques to quantify the
risk of privacy violation. Third, occasional exceptions on informa-
tion needs, which is common in healthcare, is taken into account in
our model. We have implemented a prototype of our solution and
performed simulations on real-world medical history records.

access to all medical information of a patient, abuse or security
breaches on the system may lead to signiﬁcant damage to patients’
privacy. It is thus critical to develop security and risk mitigation
policies and technologies necessary to build and preserve the pub-
lic trust as health IT systems become ubiquitous. While a lot of
research has been done on protecting an IT system against unau-
thorized access from attackers, not much work has been done on
preventing sensitive information from being jeopardized, either due
to abuse or carelessness, by authorized users. We tackle the latter
problem in this article. For simplicity, we use the word doctors to
refer to healthcare practitioners in various roles.
Even though doctors are authorized to access their patients’ med-
ical data, in reality, there is always inherent risk in each access to
medical data, which leads to potential information leakage. For ex-
ample, a doctor may be subject to shoulder surﬁng when viewing
a patient’s record, or she may become victim of phishing. Even
though the risk of each individual access may be small, the aggre-
gated risk of a large number of accesses may become signiﬁcant.
While a patient’s medical information on various health issues may
be available on a health IT system, it is desirable for doctors to ac-
cess only the information that is relevant to their current tasks so as
to comply with the principle of need-to-know.
In practice, hospitals often have difﬁculties enforcing the need-
to-know principle, because it is infeasible for policy makers to fore-
see what information a doctor may need in various situations. Fur-
thermore, occasional exceptions on information need is common
in healthcare. In reality, almost all hospitals have to grant doctors
unlimited access to virtually everything about their patients, which
leads to unaccountable risk on patients’ medical data. Such a com-
promise hospitals have to make reveals the fundamental discrep-
ancy between how access decisions are made in traditional access
control models and how they are made in reality.
In traditional
access control models, security administrators specify whether an
information consumer can access a certain resource. However, in
practical healthcare environments, it is information consumers (e.g.
doctors) who determine what to access.
In this paper, we propose a practical quantiﬁed risk-adaptive ac-
cess control model for health IT systems. A risk-adaptive access
control model may not have explicit user-to-resource authorization.
Information consumers have the freedom to choose what to access.
A user’s data-accessing activities are associated with quantiﬁed risk
scores, which will be added up over time. Request to access a re-
source is granted if doing so will not make the user’s aggregated
risk exceed his/her tolerance threshold set by the system; otherwise,
the request is denied. By effectively computing the risk scores of
different access requests and setting appropriate tolerance thresh-
olds for users, a risk-adaptive access control system is able to allow
information consumers’ to make access decisions while controlling

aggregated risk at an acceptable level.
(cid:15) We formally deﬁne an adversary model for health IT systems.
The behaviors of honest users and malicious users are modeled
using statistical approaches. Occasional exceptions on informa-
tion need have been taken into account in the user modeling.
(cid:15) We deﬁne risk based on the compliance of need-to-know. In our
model, accessing information that is needed by one’s job leads
to a low risk score, while accessing irrelevant information results
in a high one. This is different from existing risk-adaptive ac-
cess control models, such as Fuzzy MLS [1] and Fuzzy BLP [3],
which measure risk according to the amount and the sensitivity
of requested data.
(cid:15) We design a novel risk-quantiﬁcation approach. Our system
learns how different types of medical records are relevant to var-
ious tasks from doctors’ common practice. We employ the con-
cept of entropy from information theory to compute risk scores.
Furthermore, we design a statistical method to determine the risk
tolerance threshold for users.
(cid:15) We have implemented our solution and performed evaluation us-
ing the medical history records provided by our hospital partners.
Evaluating the effectiveness of risk-adaptive access control sys-
tems has long been recognized as a challenging problem. To
our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to evaluate a risk-adaptive access
control solution over large-scale real-world data.
Finally, even though our risk-adaptive access control model is
proposed for health IT systems, many ideas may be useful in other
scenarios. Many dynamic resource-sharing systems, such as on-
line social networks, may beneﬁt from the features offered by risk-
adaptive access control.
2. ADVERSARY MODEL
In this section, we deﬁne the adversary model in health IT sys-
tems. As stated in Section 1, we focus on controlling the risk as-
sociated with doctors’ access to medical records. In our systems,
all users, including adversaries, are doctors, who are authorized for
their patients’ medical information.
Assumption 1: All the doctors, honest or malicious, will fulﬁl their
healthcare job duties.
Patients trust doctors for their health. If doctors do not perform
their job, they could do a lot of harm to their patients in the phys-
ical world. Unlike most existing adversary models, such as those
on computer networks and operating systems, we do not assume
that there exist any malicious doctor who focuses on cracking the
access control system without fulﬁlling any job duty. Based on the
assumption, we deﬁne two types of doctors. Honest doctors in-
tend to access the medical information that is needed to fulﬁll their
tasks. Malicious doctors do what honest doctors do except that
they sometimes intentionally access patients’ medical information
that is irrelevant to their tasks. We refer to such actions as over-
accessing patients’ information.
Given a purpose, such as serving a patient on a health issue,
there is no absolute categorization on which of the patient’s med-
ical records are relevant to the purpose and which are not. Some
records are more likely to be useful than others. To formally mod-
el the behaviors of the two types of doctors described above, we
introduce a hypothetical function θ, called the relevance-relation
function, such that given a purpose t and a medical record m, θ re-
turns a value in [0, 1] that reﬂects the degree of relevance between
t and m. The higher θ(t, m) is, the more useful m is with respect
to t. Note that θ is hypothetical and we do not assume either the

health IT system or any doctor knows the concrete form of θ. We
will discuss how to estimate θ in Section 3. Intuitively, with their
professional knowledge, doctors’ overall decisions on information
needs in various conditions should approximate θ.
(HONEST AND MALICIOUS). Let D(cid:18) be a
distribution such that P r(mjt) = δ (cid:1) θ(t, m), where P r(mjt)
is the probability that record m is accessed to serve purpose t,
θ is the relevance-relation function, δ is a real-number so that
(cid:6)ti∈T P r(mjti) = 1, and T is the set of all purposes.
(cid:15) Honest doctors: Given a patient pi and a purpose tj, let Mi;j be
the set of medical records chosen by an honest doctor. For each
record mk 2 Mi;j, with probability (1(cid:0)ϵ1), the selection of mk
follows the distribution D(cid:18); with probability ϵ1, mk is chosen
uniformly random among all the available records of patient pi,
where ϵ1 2 [0, 1].

Intuitively, an honest doctor’s choice of records is based on the
likelihood of those records’ usefulness with regards to her curren-
t purpose (i.e. following distribution D(cid:18)); exceptions occur with

practice.
3. RISK QUANTIFICATION
3.1 Why Existing Solutions Do Not Work?
As stated in Section 1, access to medical information in the
health IT system has inherent risk. There are many factors that
may contribute to such risk. Common factors considered in exist-
ing work [2, 1, 3] on risk-adaptive access control include the num-
ber of records that are accessed, the sensitivity of those records, and
the security level of a user. First, risk is computed for each individ-
ual access request, and thus, the more records a user accesses, the
higher risk she aggregates. Second, the more sensitive the request-
ed information is, the higher risk an access activity contains. Third,
the higher the user’s security level, the lower risk is associated with
her actions. While such design may be nature in other scenarios, it
does not work well in the context of healthcare due to the following
practical reasons:
(cid:15) The amount of information needed by doctors to complete their
tasks may vary greatly. The number of medical records a doctor
needs to access over a certain period of time depends on many
factors, including the number of patients she serves, the length
of patients’ medical history, and so on. Such factors vary among
doctors and may change from time to time. It is thus very hard to
determine how much risk we should tolerate for a doctor, if the
aggregated risk depends on the number of records she accesses.
Furthermore, if a doctor believes knowing more information that
is relevant to her patient’s conditions enables her to make better
decisions, the underlying access control scheme should not dis-
courage her from doing so by increasing her accumulated risk.
(cid:15) There is no predeﬁned security levels for doctors or medical
records in a health IT system. In hospitals, doctors may have
specialization and medical records may be categorized based on
407
content. A doctor’s specialization affects what types of medical
records she requests. For example, doctors specializing in sexu-
ally transmitted diseases (STD) will naturally need a lot of STD-
related information in their work. STD records are preserved to
be more sensitive than many other medical records. If risk s-
cores are determined by data sensitivity, STD specialists would
aggregate risk much faster than other doctors.
In general, quantifying risk based on the amount of information
and the security level of users and data falls short to meet the prac-
tical settings in healthcare.
3.2 A Novel Risk-Quantiﬁcation Method
In our risk-quantiﬁcation method, we do not attempt to quanti-
fy the total amount of risk due to doctors’ demands on information.
We are more interested in determining whether taking the risk from
a doctor’s data-accessing activities is worthwhile. Accessing med-
ical information that is irrelevant to one’s task leads to risk but re-
sults in little beneﬁt. The access control system should discourage
doctors from intentionally doing so, i.e. over-accessing patients’
information.
Overview As a preliminary step, each medical record in the health
IT system has a label which indicates its category. The computation
of risk scores consists of the following steps:
1. When a doctor requests to access a medical record, her access
request is labeled with a purpose.
2. The access control system keeps a log on all the data-
accessing activities doctors perform. For each activity, the
system records the purpose of the access and the label of the
requested record.
3. Risk scores are computed periodically. The amount of risk
depends on whether the records a doctor accessed in the past
period are relevant to her purposes.
4. A doctor’s risk scores over different periods of time are ag-
gregated and used for access control.
We will discuss how to use the risk scores to perform access con-
trol in Section 4. In the rest of this section, we describe the details
of the three important steps in our risk-quantiﬁcation method. They
are (1) how to label medical records and access requests; (2) how to
