**Elasticsearch version** : 5.0.0-alpha5
**Plugins installed** : []
**JVM version** : Oracle Java 1.8.0_102
**OS version** : Windows 10 x86_64
**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior** :
When switching from 5.0.0-alpha4 to 5.0.0-alpha5, existing elasticsearch.yml
stopped working, with what appears as an impossible error to bypass. I expect
the node to startup, but the PR #19803 seems to completely change the logic
for starting a new Node object.
With my working in 5.0.0-alpha4 configuration, with 5.0.0-alpha5, I get this
exception:
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown [transport] type [] possible values: [local]
        at org.elasticsearch.common.util.ExtensionPoint$SelectedType.bindType(ExtensionPoint.java:151)
        at org.elasticsearch.common.network.NetworkModule.configure(NetworkModule.java:154)
I have to add `transport.type: local` because the default isn't detecting
`local`. Then, once i've added `transport.type`, I get this exception:
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown [http_transport] type [] possible values: []
        at org.elasticsearch.common.util.ExtensionPoint$SelectedType.bindType(ExtensionPoint.java:151)
        at org.elasticsearch.common.network.NetworkModule.configure(NetworkModule.java:159)
To get past this error, i can change `http.enabled` to `false`, which I don't
want to do, but it seems that previous "working" is no longer the case.
As for expected result, I'd ideally expect previous defaults to work. If that
isn't possible, it would be beneficial to provide better error messages as I
have no clue why `http_transport` is being output if `http.enabled: true`.
Also breaking changes for 5.0 should be updated for embedded users.
**Steps to reproduce** :  
I setup a sample maven project to recreate this issue and included the
relevant sections below.  
https://github.com/ruckc/elasticsearch-embedded-issue
elasticsearch.yml:
    network.host: 127.0.0.1
    http.port: 9200
    http.enabled: true
    gateway.expected_nodes: 1
    cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low: 512mb
    cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high: 256mb
    path.data: target/test/testdata2
    path.home: target/test
sample main method:
        public static void main(String... args) throws IOException {
            try (InputStream is = Main.class.getResourceAsStream("/elasticsearch.yml")) {
                Settings settings = Settings.builder().loadFromStream("elasticsearch.yml", is).build();
                Node node = new Node(settings);
                node.start();
            }
        }
