User: I have recently moved from Python on Windows to Python on Ubuntu. In Windows I could just hit F5 in the IDLE editor to run the script. However, in Ubuntu I have to run the script by typing python /path/to/file.py to execute.
The thing is it seems the imports within the file are not working when I run from command line.
It gives me the error:
NameError: global name 'open_file' is not defined
This is the open_file method of Pytables. In the python file I have:
from tables import *
I have made the file executable and all.
Appreciate your help.
Assistant: The pytables on my ubuntu system is 2.3.1. I think that open_file is a version 3 thing. I'm not sure where you can pick up the latest package, but you could always install the latest with pip.
