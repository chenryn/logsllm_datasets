ment that an attacker has never seen before. This will require imagination, 
creativity, and the use of deception. 
Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does 
not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose 
opponent does not know what to attack. AoW: VI. Weak Points 
and Strong 
Adversary cyber reconnaissance should be made as difficult as possible. 
Adversaries must have to work hard for their intelligence, and they should 
doubt that the information they were able to steal is accurate. Attackers should 
be forced to lose time, wander into digital traps, and betray information re-
garding their identity and intentions.  
Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move 
maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy 
will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at 
it. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with 
a body of picked men he lies in wait for him. AoW: V. Energy

As in athletics, cyber warfare tactics are often related to leverage. In an 
effort to gain the upper hand, both attackers and defenders attempt to dive 
deeper than their opponent into files, applications, operating systems, compil-
ers, and hardware. Strategic attacks even target future technologies at their 
source: the research and development networks of software companies or per-
sonnel working in the defense industry. 
The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret 
recesses of the earth… AoW: IV. Tactical Dispositions 
In fact, professional hacker tools and tactics are stealthy enough that a wise 
system administrator should presume some level of system breach at all times. 
Defenses should be designed on the assumption that there is always a digital 
spy somewhere in the camp. 
One of the first challenges in cyber warfare is simply to know if you 
are under attack. Therefore, a good short-term cyber defense goal is to im-
prove an organization‟s ability to collect, evaluate, and transmit digital evi-
dence. 
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear 
the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the 
enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If 
you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in 
every battle. AoW: III. Attack by Stratagem 
In the late 1990‟s, Moonlight Maze, the “largest cyber-intelligence investiga-
tion ever,” uncovered wide-ranging attacks targeting U.S. technical research, 
government contracts, encryption techniques, and war-planning data. Despite 
years of effort, law enforcement was able to find “disturbingly few clues” to

help determine attribution.4 And because cyber warfare is a new phenomenon 
that changes so quickly, it is difficult even for law enforcement officers to be 
sure they are operating within the constraints of the law. 
A long-term national objective should be the creation of a Distant Early 
Warning Line for cyber war. National security threats such as propaganda, 
espionage, and attacks on critical infrastructure have not changed, but they are 
now Internet-enabled. Adversaries have a new delivery mechanism that can 
increase the speed, diffusion, and even the power of an attack. 
Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to 
strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of or-
dinary men, is foreknowledge. AoW: XIII. The Use of Spies 
Because IT security is a highly technical discipline, a broader organizational 
support structure must be built around it. To understand the capabilities and 
intentions of potential adversaries, such an effort must incorporate the analysis 
of both cyber and non-cyber data points. Geopolitical knowledge is critical. 
Whenever international tension is high, cyber defenders must now take their 
posts. In today‟s Middle East, it is safe to assume that cyber attacks will al-
ways accompany the conflict on the ground: in 2006, as fighting broke out 
between Israel and Gaza, pro-Palestinian hackers denied service to around 700 
Israeli Internet domains (Stoil and Goldstein, 2006). 
Information collection and evaluation was so important to Sun Tzu that 
the entire final chapter of Art of War is devoted to espionage. Spies are called 
the “sovereign‟s most precious faculty” and espionage a “divine manipulation 
of the threads.” The cost of spying, when compared to combat operations, is 
said to be so low that it is the “height of inhumanity” to ignore it; such a com-

unable to gain further attribution (Adams, 2001).

mander is “no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of 
victory.”5 
In the wars of the future, brains will beat brawn with increasing fre-
quency. Following the IT Revolution, the need for investment in human capi-
tal has risen dramatically. However, cyber defense is still an immature disci-
pline, and it is difficult to retain personnel with highly marketable training. To 
gain a long-term competitive advantage, a nation must invest in science and 
technology as a national priority (Rarick, 1996). 
Objective Calculations 
Sun Tzu warns that a commander must exhaustively and dispassionately ana-
lyze all available information. Offensive operations in particular should wait 
until a decisive victory is expected. If objective calculations yield an unfavor-
able result, the inferior party must assume a defensive posture until circum-
stances have changed in its favor (Sawyer, 1994). 
Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in 
his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a bat-
tle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many cal-
culations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how 
much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point 
that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose. AoW: I. Laying 
Plans 
In any conflict, there are prevailing environmental and situational fac-
tors over which the combatants have little control. Art of War lists over three 
dozen 
such 
factors 
to 
evaluate,

dox/unorthodox, rested/exhausted, dry/wet, and confident/afraid (Sawyer, 
1994). Most of these will have direct or indirect parallels in cyberspace. 
In cyberspace, reliable calculations are extremely difficult to perform. 
First and foremost, cyber attackers possess enough advantages over defenders 
that there is an enormous gap in Return-on-Investment (RoI) between them. 
The cost of conducting a cyber attack is cheap, and there is little penalty for 
failure. Network reconnaissance can be conducted, without fear of retaliation, 
until a suitable vulnerability is found. Once an adversary system is compro-
mised and exploited, there are often immediate rewards. By comparison, cyber 
defense is expensive, challenging, and there is no tangible RoI. 
Another aspect of cyberspace that makes calculation difficult is its con-
stantly changing nature. The Internet is a purely artificial construct that is 
modified continually from across the globe. Cyber reconnaissance and intelli-
gence collection are of reliable valuable to a military commander only for a 
short period of time. The geography of cyberspace changes without warning; 
software updates and network reconfiguration create an environment where 
insurmountable obstacles and golden opportunities can appear and disappear 
as if by magic. The terrestrial equivalent could only be a catastrophic event 
such as an earthquake or an unexpected snowstorm. 
Art of War describes six types of battlefield terrain, ranging from “ac-
cessible,” that can be freely traversed by both sides, to “narrow passes,” which 
must either be strongly garrisoned or avoided altogether (unless the adversary 
has failed to fortify them).6 Although they will change over time, cyber equiv-
alents for each Art of War terrain type are easily found in Internet, intranet, 
firewall, etc. 
The natural formation of the country is the soldier‟s best ally; 
but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the 
forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dan-

gers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general. AoW: 
X. Terrain 
Cyberspace possesses characteristics that the Art of War framework 
does not encompass. For example, in cyberspace the terrestrial distance be-
tween adversaries can be completely irrelevant. If „connectivity‟ exists be-
tween two computers, attacks can be launched at any time, from anywhere in 
the world, and they can strike their targets instantly. There is no easily defined 
„front line‟: civilian and military zones on the Internet often share the same 
space, and military networks typically rely on civilian infrastructure to operate. 
With such amazing access to an adversary, never before in history has superior 
logic – not physical size or strength – more often determined the victor in con-
flict. 
Similar to cyber geography, cyber weapons also have unreliable char-
acteristics. Some attacks that hackers expect to succeed fail, and vice versa. 
Exploits may work on one, but not another, apparently similar target. Exploits 
that work in one instance may never work again. Thus, it can be impossible to 
know if a planned cyber attack will succeed until the moment it is launched. 
Cyber weapons should be considered single-use weapons, because defenders 
can reverse-engineer them to defend their networks or try to use them for their 
own offensive purposes. These limitations make meticulous pre-operational 
cyber attack planning and timing critical (Parks and Duggan, 2001; Lewis, 
2002). 
Last but not least, one of the major challenges confronting any military 
commander is to keep track of the location and constitution of adversary forc-
es. However, cyber defenses such as passive network monitoring devices can 
be nearly impossible to find. 
If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly 
country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins 
CCD CoE · February 9, 2011 
filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must 
be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places 
where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking. 
AoW: IX. The Army on the March 
Cyber commanders are wise to assume, especially if they are conducting an 
offensive operation on adversary terrain, that the defenses and traps they can 
see are more powerful than they appear, and that there are some defenses in 
place that they will never find. Adversary sensors could even lie on the open 
Internet, such as on a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP), outside of 
the cyber terrain that the adversary immediately controls. 
Time to Fight 
Once the decision to go to war has been made (or forced), Sun Tzu offers 
plenty of battlefield advice to a military commander. Art of War operations 
emphasize speed, surprise, economy of force, and asymmetry. These charac-
teristics happen to be synonymous with cyber warfare. 
Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy‟s 
unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack 
unguarded spots. AoW: XI. The Nine Situations 
If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an 
advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the 
other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves 
the sacrifice of its baggage and stores. AoW: VII. Maneuvering 
The potential role of computer network operations in military conflict 
has been compared to strategic bombing, submarine warfare, special opera-
CCD CoE · February 9, 2011 
tions forces, and assassins (Parks and Duggan, 2001).The goal of such unor-
thodox, asymmetric attacks is to inflict painful damage on an adversary from a 
safe distance or from close quarters with the element of surprise. 
By discovering the enemy‟s dispositions and remaining invisi-
ble ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the 
enemy‟s must be divided…Hence there will be a whole pitted 
against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be 
many to the enemy‟s few. AoW: VI. Weak Points and Strong 
In theory, a cyber attack can accomplish the same objectives as a special forc-
es raid, with the added benefit of no human casualties on either side. If cyber 
attacks were to achieve that level of success, they could come to redefine ele-
gance in warfare. 
A cyber attack is best understood not as an end in itself, but as an ex-
traordinary means to accomplish almost any objective. Cyber propaganda can 
reach the entire world in seconds via online news media; cyber espionage can 
be used to steal even nuclear weapons technology (Gerth and Risen, 1999); a 
successful cyber attack on an electrical grid could bring down myriad other 
infrastructures that have no other source of power (Divis, 2005); and in 2008 
and 2009 hackers were even able to force entire nation-states offline. (Keizer, 
2008; Keizer, 2009). A good analogy from Art of War is in the way Sun Tzu 
describes the military use of fire. 
There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn 
soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is 
to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and mag-
azines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.
