User: Is there any method to connect to vpn through python and have that traffic of that application only route through the said VPN?
Assistant: Python itself can't be used to route traffic; though you can use it to execute system commands to change your routing table.  If you're on Linux, you need to use the ip command from the iproute2 and iptables from netfilter to change the routing behavior of specific traffic.
