With the beta releases 3rd party modules either needs always to be updated
otherwise developer will end up with obscure errors when instanceof doesn't
work. For example, the `angular2-jwt` had this problem when it's dependency
was beta.0 and devs would use beta.1 so two versions of angular2 would bundle
together when using browserify or webpack. Developers will also have this
problem if they revert to beta.0 for the minification problems and these 3rd
party modules didn't specify compatibility correctly in package.json
### proposal
  * Provide a way to determine the angular2 version
  * Warn developers if there are two versions bundled (only during the beta releases and in development)
