### Security Evaluation and Breach Analysis

#### Site Owner's Assessment
The owner of the site admitted that security had not been a top priority. The majority of the codebase dates back to 2008 and requires PHP 5.3. Passwords have been stored in a hashed (though not salted) form since 2015. The site is also vulnerable to known Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which the owner has been planning to address. He speculated that the security breach might be linked to a large-scale DDoS attack that occurred around the same time.

The owner plans to prioritize salting passwords and upgrading the PHP and web server versions. However, he does not currently intend to notify users about the breach.

#### Site O (Outdoors, Alexa Rank 18,000)
We received a response from Site O less than 45 minutes after the initial notification was sent. The response came from the CEO of a competing site, who explained that they had recently acquired Site O from a major American travel-reviews company. They transferred accounts from Site O to their own platform in May 2016, which aligns with the timeframe when our accounts were compromised. After we provided our methodology and data, the CEO stated that they were unaware of any account breach but had conducted extensive scripted testing to ensure a smooth transition. Further inquiries regarding their planned actions went unanswered, and users of Site O have not been notified of the compromise.

#### Discussion on Account Information Theft
We believe that the account information was stolen from the sites where our registered accounts were accessed. As discussed in Section 4.4, we took numerous steps to ensure the integrity of our methodology. However, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that either the email provider or our own systems were compromised, leading to the account leaks.

Empirical evidence suggests that the accounts were likely compromised at the registration sites. We had over 100,000 email accounts from the provider, only a subset of which were used to register accounts. Only a small number of these accounts were accessed, and all of them were used for registration. It is unlikely that an attacker would have bypassed our operational security, obtained the credentials, and then accessed only a fraction of the accounts. The odds of them selecting just the accounts we used at these sites are extremely low. Additionally, they would need to know the specific sites and have a reason to target those accounts.

When engaging with the sites, only one (Site C) confirmed a breach, which was implicitly public as the site was illegally cloned by an attacker. Even in this case, the owner did not notify users. Other sites could not confirm a breach but offered no alternative explanation for how the account information could have been stolen. In two cases, we have additional corroborating evidence (Section 6.1.3).

There are two main reasons why sites may not inform users about a breach:
1. **Insufficient Information**: The disclosures we provide indicate a breach but do not specify how it occurred. Tripwire provides a broad timeframe, which can be up to 18 months in extreme cases. This lack of detail makes it difficult for sites to pinpoint and prevent future breaches.
2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Publicly acknowledging a breach carries significant legal and financial risks, especially for business-run sites. The risk of a few leaked accounts may not justify the potential costs.

#### Attacker Behavior
We characterized the activity of attackers using the stolen email accounts. Most attackers accessed the accounts repeatedly over the observation period. Some accounts were shut down for sending spam, but in many cases, the attackers did not take further action beyond siphoning emails. The accounts were accessed through a global network of primarily compromised residential machines acting as proxies, typically via IMAP. The login patterns suggest that credentials are being fed into automated collection systems. We have released our data with reduced granularity, which is discussed in more detail in Section 7.4.

##### Login Frequency
Table 3 lists the email accounts accessed, the type of password used, the total number of accesses, and the days between account registration and first remote access, last access, and the first and last accesses.

Two sites (E and F) showed periodic, temporally aligned logins, indicating they are owned and operated by the same entity. Otherwise, there was no discernible pattern across accounts regarding access timing. Both recurring and non-recurring logins were observed, with some accounts showing behavior consistent with ongoing observation or scraping.

##### Bursty Logins
Eleven accounts exhibited bursty login behavior, with multiple logins from different IP addresses in rapid succession. In the most extreme case, account g1 experienced 46 distinct IPs accessing the account over 10 minutes, suggesting loosely coupled systems and frequent failures. Nine accounts (b1, e1, f1, g1, k1, k2, m1, m2, r2) experienced bursts of logins where a single IP accessed the same account dozens or hundreds of times within a few seconds, making up more than 75% of the logins in some cases.

##### Login IPs
The IP addresses originating the account logins are consistent with large-scale botnets of leased proxies. A total of 1316 distinct IPs logged into our accounts across approximately 1792 login attempts. Only 181 IPs appeared more than once, with one IP appearing 58 times (to account r2). Based on WHOIS data, the most popular countries were Russia (194 IPs), China (144), USA (135), and Vietnam (89), representing 92 countries in total. Most IPs appear to be residential/consumer IPs, though some higher-volume IPs map to datacenter IPs, suggesting compromised servers.

##### Account Activity
Despite the goal of stealing accounts, many of the compromised accounts have been relatively idle. No unexpected email messages beyond generic spam were received. Eight of the 27 accounts showed suspect behavior: the email provider forced a password reset on account m1 after recognizing the compromise. Accounts b1, g2, h1, h2, i2, k1, and m2 were deactivated for sending spam. Prior to deactivation, account g2 had its password changed and forwarding address removed by the attacker.
