By the owner’s own evaluation, security had not been a priority
for the site: most of the code is from 2008, and requires PHP 5.3;
passwords have only been stored in a hashed (‘encrypted’) form
since 2015, but are still unsalted; the site suffers from some known
XSS vulnerabilities that he has been intending to fix. The owner
speculated that the compromise could be related to a large DDoS
attack he experienced around the time of compromise which lasted
several days.
He explained that he plans to prioritize salting passwords and
upgrading his PHP and web server versions, although he was not
presently planning on notifying users of the breach.
6.3.8 Site O (Outdoors, Alexa rank 18000). We received a
response from site O less than 45 minutes after the initial notification
was sent. This response, from the CEO of a competing site, explained
that they had recently acquired site O from a major American travel-
reviews company and that they had transferred accounts from site O
to their own site in May of 2016 (the timeframe that our accounts
were compromised). After we responded with our methodology
and data for their site, the CEO responded saying that they were
unaware of any account breach, but that they had performed a “lot
of scripted testing” of logins onto their own site to ensure a smooth
transition. Additional clarifications and questions regarding actions
they planned on taking did not receive a reply, and users of site O
have not been notified of the compromise.
6.3.9 Discussion. We believe that account information was stolen
from the sites at which our registered accounts were accessed. As dis-
cussed in Section 4.4, we took many steps to ensure the integrity of
our methodology, but we cannot categorically rule out the possibility
that either the email provider or our own systems were compromised
and that this was unwittingly the source of the account leaks.
However, the empirical evidence is inconsistent with the accounts
being obtained via a breach other than at the sites at which they were
registered. We had over 100,000 email accounts from the provider,
only a subset of which were used to register accounts. Only a small
number of those accounts were ever accessed, and all the ones
accessed were used to register accounts. It also seems unlikely that an
attacker would have defeated our operational security (or that of the
email provider), obtained the account credentials, and then accessed
only a fraction of the accounts acquired. Moreover, the odds that, in
so doing, they would have happened to select just the accounts we
used at these sites seems vanishingly small. Realistically, they would
also need to know the sites at which we used each account, and have
some reason to specifically target the accounts at those sites.
When engaging with the sites, only one of the sites we contacted
(Site C) was able to confirm that their site experienced a breach,
and in this case the breach was implicitly public since the site was
illegally cloned by an attacker. Even in this case, though, the owner
did not explicitly notify the site users that their account information
had been stolen. All other sites were unable to confirm a breach. Yet,
none of the sites were able to offer another explanation for how our
account information could have been stolen, and in two cases we
have other corroborating evidence (Section 6.1.3).
Given this situation, there are two immediate possibilities for why
sites may not inform users about a breach. One is that the sites did
not have sufficient information to corroborate the breach. Indeed,
consider the perspective of the sites we contacted. The disclosures
we provide inform sites that they have been breached, but do not give
any information about how this occurred. Tripwire provides bounds
of a compromise timeframe (between account registration and first
login), but those bounds can be quite broad—in our study, this
period was more than 18 months in the most extreme case. Further,
while sites naturally asked to know which accounts on their service
triggered detection, there is little information to be gleaned from
these accounts, provided the compromise occurred after registration
time. Such information provides sites with little insight on where
to look for evidence of a compromise, nor how to prevent it from
happening again.
Finally, even if a site believes Tripwire’s evidence that a breach
occurred, the specifics may not be sufficient to convince sites to incur
the cost of acknowledging a breach. There are substantial potential
legal and financial repercussions of publicly acknowledging a breach,
particularly for sites run by businesses. The knowledge of a small
number of leaked accounts, internally confirmed or not, may not
constitute sufficient risk given the potential cost.
6.4 Attacker behavior
Lastly, we characterize the activity of attackers with the stolen email
accounts [38]. In general, most attackers accessed the accounts re-
peatedly over the observation period. Although some accounts were
shut down for sending spam, in many cases attackers have not taken
active steps to use the accounts beyond siphoning email. Accounts
appear to be accessed through a global network of predominantly
compromised residential machines acting as proxies, typically via
IMAP. Account login timing and frequency suggests that credentials
are being fed into automated collection systems. We have released
our data for these accesses with lightly reduced granularity, which
we discuss in more detail in Secion 7.4.
6.4.1 Login frequency. Table 3 lists the email accounts ac-
cessed, the type of password used by the account, the total number
of accesses, and the number of days between account registration
and first remote access, number of days since last access (as of Feb.
1, 2017), and the number of days between the first and last accesses.

Table 3: Number and date range of login activity for compro-
mised accounts. “Until” indicates the number of days between
registration and first access. “Since” indicates the number of
days since the most recent login (as of last check).
‘Frozen’ indicates whether the account has been frozen by our email
provider due to suspicious activity. The account aliases encode the
sites at which they were registered (e.g., we registered account a1
at site A).
Two of the sites (E and F) show periodic, temporally aligned
logins. Manual inspection revealed that these two sites were owned
and operated by the same entity, and appear to use the same regis-
tration backend. Otherwise, we found no discernible pattern across
accounts regarding access timing. The data shows both recurring
and non-recurring logins for sites: at the most popular site A, both
accounts were only accessed once, while account m1 has been ac-
cessed 392 times. Accounts from several of the sites exhibit behavior
consistent with ongoing observation or scraping rather than simply
verifying credentials.
6.4.2 Bursty logins. Although no overall pattern emerges, eleven
of the accounts have bursty login behavior where multiple logins
occur to the same account from different IP addresses in rapid suc-
cession of each other. In the peak case, g1 experiences 46 distinct
IPs accessing the account over 10 minutes. This behavior suggests
that the systems used to login to accounts are very loosely coupled
and failure is common. Nine of the accounts (b1, e1, f1, g1, k1,
k2, m1, m2, r2) experience bursts of logins wherein a single IP
accesses the same account dozens or hundreds of times within a few
seconds. In the extreme cases, this can make up more than 75% of
the logins seen for an account.
6.4.3 Login IPs. The IP addresses originating the account lo-
gins are consistent with large-scale botnets of leased proxies. As
of our final check, a total of 1316 distinct IPs logged into the our
accounts across approximately 1792 login attempts. Only 181 IPs
appeared more than once in the logs, with one IP appearing 58 times
(to account r2).
Based on WHOIS data, the most popular countries represented
are Russia (194 IPs), China (144), USA (135), and Vietnam (89),
with a total of 92 countries represented. Combining manual anal-
ysis of WHOIS with DNS, the majority of these IPs appear to be
residential/consumer IPs, though several higher-volume IPs map
to datacenter IPs with hosts serving legitimate content, suggesting
compromised servers.6
6.4.4 Account activity. Since one of the goals of site compro-
mise is to steal accounts, it is somewhat surprising that many of the
stolen accounts have been relatively idle. No email account that has
been accessed has received any unexpected email messages beyond
a few generic spam messages.
Eight of the 27 accounts do show suspect behavior, though. The
email provider forced a password reset on one of our accounts, m1,
after recognizing account compromise. Accounts b1, g2, h1, h2,
i2, k1 and m2 were all deactivated by the email provider for sending
spam. Prior to being shut down, account g2 had had the password
changed and our forwarding address removed by the attacker. For the
