one IXP (see Fig. 4); one remote peer may connect (through different
resellers) to multiple IXPs with just one router (see Fig. 9d). In these
cases, an outage in a single IXP or IXP switch port: (i) propagates
much further than the metropolitan area of the IXP over the RP
link, and (ii) may affect several IXP members at once. Even if these
members have backup paths/links that are activated upon such a
cascading outage (e.g., over their transit providers), there is some
unavoidable delay and packet loss until BGP routing converges
on the backup paths [46]; even after this happens, routing may be
sub-optimal in terms of packet-level end-to-end delay.
The IXP’s point of view. IXPs themselves do not discriminate
members as local or remote; they are simply interested in (i) attract-
ing as many ASes as possible (potentially expanding in multiple
geographical regions and colocation facilities or via RP), and offer-
ing (ii) short paths and low latencies, (iii) high throughput, and (iv)
additional services. However, they are aware of which customers
are “virtual” (Section 3.5), i.e., connected on a virtual port offered
by a port reseller, since they need to terminate the inner VLAN and
configure the IXP-end of the virtual port. For IXPs, RP inference
(uncovering also distant, non-virtual IXP peers; see Steps 2-5 in
Section 5.2) is interesting for two main reasons: (a) to overcome
the local saturation and find new attractive markets/locations for
expansion, and (b) to offer to their customers transparency as to
who is local and who is not. Finally, we note emerging RP flavors.
For instance, NL-IX is a reseller for AMS-IX; DE-CIX offers the
GlobePeer [9] product that allows an IXP member to acquire access
to all DE-CIX peers irrespective of their location.
8 FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
Being equipped with a methodology that reliably infers RP, we
identify the following directions for future work in this field.
Traffic Analysis. Knowing which IXP peering interconnections
are remote/local, a natural follow-up step is to investigate the impor-
tance of RP in terms of the actual traffic flowing over the switching
infrastructure of an IXP. To achieve this, we need datasets contain-
ing the traffic levels of remote and local IXP peering connections.
Beyond Pings. Measuring RTTs using pings from VPs within the
IXP suffers from limited and unstable VPs. However, traceroutes
from VPs anywhere in the world, can provide an additional source of
useful RTT measurements that cover much more in space and time
than pings. In fact, the difference of the RTTs between the VP and
the consecutive IP interfaces involved in a –potential– IXP crossing,
as observed in a traceroute path, can provide an indication of the
delay between the associated IXP peers. Fig. 12b shows the RTTs
between the LINX LON LG and the interfaces of the members of
LINX, using traceroutes (see Section 3.1) and pings; we observe that
the RTT patterns are close, supporting such an approach. However,
traceroute-based approaches come with their own set of challenges
such as asymmetric paths, load-balancing artifacts, ICMP rate-limits
and heterogeneous opaque layer-2 connectivity mechanisms [58,
72]. We plan to investigate inference approaches that are robust
against such artifacts and enable us to scale up our methodology,
decoupling it from ping-based measurements.
Longitudinal Study. In Section 6.3 we analyzed the RP growth of
5 IXPs over a period spanning more than a year. Understanding
whether our observations represent an actual trend, and not just
recent developments in the IXP ecosystem, requires digging deeper
into history. Since daily RTT measurements (pings) from LGs in
IXPs are not available for all IXPs (e.g., during the time-frame of
13
Section 6.3), we aim to apply a traceroute-based methodology to
perform an extensive analysis in space (more IXPs) and time (years).
Other Implications/Trade-offs. Evaluating the impact of RP and
routing policies (Section 6.4) on the performance of CDNs and any-
cast services might be of interest to the community. RP is associated
to implications for performance, resilience/reliability, and security,
and it comes with certain trade-offs (e.g., debugging is more complex
when third-party layer-2 infrastructures are involved). Follow-up
work could focus on assessing such trade-offs and comparing RP
to more traditional connectivity practices, such as classic transit.
9 CONCLUSION
In this work, we introduce, validate, and apply a methodology that
can infer remote and local peers at IXPs with high accuracy and
coverage. Our methodology is built upon the observation that RP is
not driven only by technical factors, but is actually a business deci-
sion guided by economic considerations. In particular, taking into
account port capacities, colocation strategies, multi-IXP peerings as
well as latencies and private connectivity practices, we achieve very
high accuracy (95%) and coverage (93%) levels, outperforming the
state-of-the-art by +18% and +9%, respectively. At the same time
we reduce almost 4 times the false positive and negative rates. The
primary objective of this approach is to enable IXPs and existing
or new potential IXP members to understand which peers of an
IXP are physically local, allowing for better-informed peering and
routing decisions. Moreover, by equipping researchers with a reli-
able inference methodology, we enable the in-depth investigation
of multiple facets of the peering ecosystem, such as the detection
of routing inefficiencies that undermine the resilience and perfor-
mance of traffic exchange. In our measurement-based study of 30 of
the largest IXPs worldwide, we found that more than 90% of them
have more than 10% of their members as remote peers. Strikingly,
for large IXPs, this share may exceed 40%. The number of remote
peers grows twice as fast compared to local peers, driving the IXP
growth. The remote peers show similar patterns with local peers in
terms of customer cones, user populations and aggregated traffic
levels, indicating that remote peering is widely adopted practice
across networks. Moreover, we observe that several remote peer
routers are connected to more than 10 IXPs, while we also find evi-
dence of hybrid (remote & local) IXP peering interconnections on
the same router, with profound implications for routing resilience.
Prototype and Portal. To automate our remote peering inference
methodology and make our results publicly accessible to the com-
munity, we have implemented a web portal at [17], through which
we publish monthly snapshots of our inferences, and visualize the
geographical footprint of IXPs and their connected members.
