### One IXP and Multiple IXPs via a Single Router

A remote peer may connect to one IXP (as shown in Fig. 4) or to multiple IXPs through different resellers using just one router (as illustrated in Fig. 9d). In such configurations, an outage at a single IXP or IXP switch port can have significant consequences:
1. The outage can propagate beyond the metropolitan area of the IXP over the remote peering (RP) link.
2. It may affect several IXP members simultaneously.

Even if these members have backup paths/links that activate during such outages (e.g., through their transit providers), there is an unavoidable delay and packet loss until BGP routing converges on the backup paths [46]. After convergence, the routing may still be sub-optimal in terms of end-to-end delay.

### The IXPâ€™s Perspective

IXPs do not differentiate between local and remote members; they aim to:
1. Attract as many ASes as possible, potentially expanding into multiple geographical regions and colocation facilities or via RP.
2. Offer short paths and low latencies.
3. Provide high throughput.
4. Deliver additional services.

However, IXPs are aware of which customers are "virtual," meaning they are connected via a virtual port offered by a port reseller. This awareness is necessary for terminating the inner VLAN and configuring the IXP-end of the virtual port. For IXPs, inferring RP (including uncovering distant, non-virtual IXP peers; see Steps 2-5 in Section 5.2) is valuable for two main reasons:
1. To identify new attractive markets/locations for expansion.
2. To offer transparency to their customers regarding which peers are local and which are not.

Emerging RP flavors include NL-IX, which is a reseller for AMS-IX, and DE-CIX's GlobePeer [9] product, which allows an IXP member to access all DE-CIX peers regardless of location.

### Future Research Directions

Equipped with a reliable methodology to infer RP, we propose the following directions for future work:

#### Traffic Analysis
Understanding the importance of RP in terms of actual traffic flowing over an IXP's switching infrastructure requires datasets containing traffic levels of both remote and local IXP peering connections.

#### Beyond Pings
While measuring RTTs using pings from VPs within the IXP has limitations, traceroutes from VPs anywhere in the world can provide additional RTT measurements covering more space and time. The difference in RTTs between the VP and the consecutive IP interfaces involved in a potential IXP crossing, as observed in a traceroute path, can indicate the delay between associated IXP peers (Fig. 12b). However, traceroute-based approaches face challenges such as asymmetric paths, load-balancing artifacts, ICMP rate-limits, and heterogeneous opaque layer-2 connectivity mechanisms [58, 72]. We plan to investigate robust inference approaches that scale up our methodology, decoupling it from ping-based measurements.

#### Longitudinal Study
In Section 6.3, we analyzed the RP growth of five IXPs over more than a year. To understand whether our observations represent a trend, we need to delve deeper into historical data. Since daily RTT measurements (pings) from LGs in IXPs are not available for all IXPs, we aim to apply a traceroute-based methodology for an extensive analysis across more IXPs and over several years.

#### Other Implications/Trade-offs
Evaluating the impact of RP and routing policies (Section 6.4) on the performance of CDNs and anycast services could be of interest to the community. RP has implications for performance, resilience, and security, and comes with trade-offs (e.g., more complex debugging when third-party layer-2 infrastructures are involved). Follow-up work could focus on assessing these trade-offs and comparing RP to traditional connectivity practices like classic transit.

### Conclusion

In this work, we introduce, validate, and apply a methodology to infer remote and local peers at IXPs with high accuracy and coverage. Our approach, driven by economic considerations, achieves 95% accuracy and 93% coverage, outperforming the state-of-the-art by +18% and +9%, respectively, while reducing false positive and negative rates by almost four times. This methodology enables IXPs and potential IXP members to make better-informed peering and routing decisions. By equipping researchers with a reliable inference method, we facilitate in-depth investigations of the peering ecosystem, such as detecting routing inefficiencies that undermine resilience and performance.

In our study of 30 of the largest IXPs worldwide, we found that more than 90% have over 10% of their members as remote peers, with some large IXPs having over 40%. Remote peers grow twice as fast as local peers, driving IXP growth. They show similar patterns to local peers in terms of customer cones, user populations, and aggregated traffic levels, indicating widespread adoption. We also observe that several remote peer routers are connected to more than 10 IXPs, with evidence of hybrid (remote & local) IXP peering interconnections on the same router, impacting routing resilience.

### Prototype and Portal

To automate our remote peering inference methodology and make results publicly accessible, we have implemented a web portal at [17], where we publish monthly snapshots of our inferences and visualize the geographical footprint of IXPs and their connected members.
