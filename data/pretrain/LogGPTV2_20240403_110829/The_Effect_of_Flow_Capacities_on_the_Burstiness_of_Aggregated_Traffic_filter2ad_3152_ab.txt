4 Capacity Distributions
We performed capacity estimation on several packet traces from edge and back-
bone network links with a wide range of average rates. The three traces that
we use in this paper are publicly available at the NLANR-MOAT site [8], and
they are described in Table 2. Note that the capacity estimation technique can
provide an estimate for a small fraction of ﬂows (about 4-13%, depending on the
trace), but for a large fraction of bytes (about 80%).

Figure 3(a) shows the distribution of TCP ﬂow capacity estimates for the two
interfaces of the MRA-1028765523 OC-12 trace. The cumulative distribution is
plotted in terms of TCP bytes, rather than TCP ﬂows. Note that most bytes are
generated from ﬂows with capacities 1.5Mbps, 10Mbps, 45Mbps, and 100Mbps.
These values correspond to some commonly used links (T1, Ethernet, T3, and
Fast Ethernet, respectively). Figure 3(b) shows the distribution of TCP ﬂow ca-
pacity estimates for two segments of the Auckland OC-3 trace [8]. Note that the

Fig. 3. Capacity distribution in terms of bytes
two distributions are quite diﬀerent. A major diﬀerence is that the 2001/06/11
trace carried traﬃc from TCP ﬂows with signiﬁcantly higher capacities. Speciﬁ-
cally, about 80% of the bytes in that trace were generated from TCP ﬂows with
a capacity of more than 10Mbps. On the other hand, more than 80% of the bytes
in the 2001/04/02 trace were carried by TCP ﬂows with a capacity of less than
3Mbps.
We have also investigated the correlation between the capacity of a ﬂow
and the ﬂow’s average throughput and maximum window size. Due to space
constraints we do not report the details of that analysis here. The main result,
however, is that both correlation coeﬃcients are close to zero, implying that the
previous two ﬂow characteristics are independent of the pre-trace capacity, and
probably independent of the end-to-end capacity as well. The reason may be
that the throughput and window size of bulk TCP transfer are often limited by
the receiver’s advertised window. The correlation coeﬃcient between Cp and the
ﬂow size is also close to zero.
5 Capacity and Traﬃc Burstiness
We employ wavelet-based energy plots to analyze the correlation structure and
burstiness of traﬃc in a range of short time scales [9,10]. Since the Poisson
stream (i.e., independent exponential interarrivals) is traditionally viewed as
benign while traﬃc with stronger variability is viewed as bursty, we use the
Poisson process as a reference point in the following analysis. The energy plot of
a Poisson process with rate λ is a horizontal line at log2(λT0), where T0 is the
minimum time scale of the energy plot. If the energy of a traﬃc process Xj at
scale Tj=2jT0 is higher than the energy of a Poisson process that has the same
average rate with Xj, then we say that Xj is bursty at scale Tj. Otherwise, we
say that Xj is smooth at scale Tj.
Figure 4(a) shows the energy plot of a highly aggregated backbone trace,
which carries thousands of ﬂows at any point in time. We focus in time scales up
to 100msec (j≤10). The correlation structure and burstiness of the trace in longer

scales is determined by Long-Range Dependency eﬀects that have been studied
in depth in earlier work [11]. The trace is clearly bursty, compared to Poisson
traﬃc, in all time scales between 1-100 msec. This may be surprising from the
perspective of the theory of point processes, because that theory predicts that the
superposition of many independent ﬂows tends to a Poisson process [12]. There
is no actual contradiction however. The previous superposition result applies
to ﬂows with rate R/N, where N is the number of aggregated ﬂows, i.e., it
assumes that the ﬂow interarrivals become “sparser” as the degree of aggregation
increases. That is not the case, however, in typical packet multiplexers; ﬂows are
aggregated in higher capacity links without artiﬁcially increasing the interarrivals
of each ﬂow.
Figure 3 shows that a major part of the previous trace (about 40% of the
bytes) are generated from 100Mbps ﬂows, i.e., ﬂows with comparable capacity to
the 622Mbps capacity of the monitored OC-12 link. These high-capacity ﬂows are
not small relative to the aggregate, neither in terms of size (not shown here), nor
in terms of rate. Consequently, we should expect that their correlation structure
and burstiness can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the burstiness of the aggregate traﬃc.
To elaborate on the previous point, we examine the energy plot of the two
Auckland traces from Figure 3(b). As previously shown, the 2001/06/11 trace
carries traﬃc from signiﬁcantly higher capacity TCP ﬂows than the 2001/04/02
trace. Figure 4(b) shows the corresponding energy plots. The 2001/06/11 trace
is clearly bursty, while the 2001/04/02 trace remains below the Poisson energy
level. We note that the two traces are similar in other aspects, including ﬂow
RTTs, number of active ﬂows, ﬂow size distribution, and average utilization.
To further examine the link between short scale burstiness and ﬂow capa-
cities, we separate the TCP ﬂows of the trace MRA-if-1 for which we have a
capacity estimate in two subsets: SH+ and SH−. SH+ consists of all ﬂows with
capacity larger that a threshold H (in Mbps), while SH− includes the remaining
ﬂows that have a lower capacity. The average rate of SH+ and SH− are 119Mbps
and 30Mbps, respectively. The energy plots of SH+ and SH− are shown in Fi-

gure 5. If the threshold H is between 1-10Mbps, the resulting energy plots are
not so sensitive to the exact value of H, and so we set H=5Mbps. Notice that
the energy plot of SH− is about at the same level with that of the correspon-
ding Poisson process, meaning that the lower capacity ﬂows do not generate
signiﬁcant burstiness. On the other hand, SH+ has much higher energy than the
corresponding Poisson process, as shown in Figure 5(a), conﬁrming our earlier
conjecture that high capacity ﬂows cause signiﬁcant burstiness in short scales.
Note that if we set H>10Mbps, then both SH+ and SH− will be characteri-
zed as bursty. Finally, it should be mentioned that the ﬁle size distributions of
SH+ and SH− are similar. SH+ includes 1937 ﬂows, with 86% of them being
larger than 10KB. SH− includes 773 ﬂows with 90% of them being larger than
10KB. Consequently, the diﬀerence in the burstiness of the two subsets cannot
be attributed to their ﬂow size distribution.
6 More Recent Results
In more recent work [13], we have further investigated the connection between
ﬂow capacities and short time scale burstiness. The main result of that work is
to explain the origin of such burstiness based on TCP self-clocking. Speciﬁcally,
we have shown that, under a certain condition on the ﬂow’s window size and
bandwidth-delay product (that is proportional to the ﬂow capacity), TCP self-
clocking can generate a two-level ON/OFF interarrival structure. That structure
results in considerable traﬃc burstiness and strong correlations in sub-RTT time
scales.
