Hi there,
we're currently test driving some of our old scripts remotely from ansible and
if we choose to use it probably will for some time.
On the one hand ansible makes it really easy to automate workflows that span
multiple servers (that we'd like to use) on the other hand though it makes it
really hard to see live whats going on on the other system.
What we would like is a way to see the output of the task on the target system
as live feedback (possibly if requested via an option in a playbook).
As far as I can see that is not possible with the current design of playbooks
as the underlying callback object does not get callbacks for individual lines
in the playbook.
As far as I understand how ansible works (ssh into the other machine run a
command) this should not be difficult to implement as the output is streamed
live to the local machine anyway (or could be easily).
So that's the feature request: show live output of remote tasks/commands. How
about it? Would you be willing to do that in ansible? Would you accept a pull
request? Is it already possible?
Best regards and thanks for the great tool!
