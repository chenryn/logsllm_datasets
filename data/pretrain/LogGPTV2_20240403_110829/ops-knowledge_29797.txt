User: Please provide a network storage solution suitable for virtualization environment
Assistant: A suitable network storage solution for virtualized environments is to use software-defined based storage technologies such as Ceph, GlusterFS or NFS. These technologies provide high availability, scalability, and flexibility, and can be used in virtualized environments. Ceph and GlusterFS are object storage solutions that can store large amounts of unstructured data and support multiple clouds and virtualization platforms, including OpenStack and VMware. NFS is a distributed file system, especially suitable for storage used by virtual machines in virtual environments. Regardless of which technology you choose, issues of data security and backup reliability should be considered.
