User: Please design a set of infrastructure architecture based on specified requirements, including hardware devices, network topology, system architecture, etc.
Assistant: Requirements: A company has 1,000 employees and needs an infrastructure to support the work needs of employees. Employees need to connect to the network and access the company's internal applications and file sharing systems. Also, companies need to secure their business data to prevent any access by unauthorized persons. Companies need a scalable infrastructure to support future growth. Solution: The infrastructure structure should meet the following requirements: 1. Hardware equipment: According to the size of the company, it is recommended to use the following hardware equipment: - 2 core routers - 4 switches - 2 firewalls - 4 Web servers 2. Network topology: Adopt The three-layer hierarchical network topology is as follows: - Core layer: Two core routers, duplicating configurations to ensure that when a network failure occurs, a backup router can take over to prevent service interruption. - Distribution layer: Switches connect devices in a department together, forming a small local area network (LAN) inside a department - Access layer: Each access switch connects devices in a department, and connects to a core router through a core switch. 3. System architecture: The company's internal applications and file sharing systems are deployed on the Web server. You can use load balancing to maintain high availability of servers, ensuring that there is a backup server that can receive data in the event of a failure. Every web server needs to run antivirus and firewall software. 4. Security: Multi-layer network security measures are adopted to protect data security, including: - Firewall: prevent unauthorized access, and only allow specific ports and IP addresses to access the internal network. - VPN: Provides virtual private network (VPN) connections for remote access employees to ensure data security. - Network monitor: Monitor all network activities, discover and locate potential security risks in time. - Data Backup: Backup data regularly to protect data from data loss, hacking. 5. Scalability: Based on this architecture, it can gradually expand with business growth. The expansion method can be: - Add more switches and routers to meet the needs of more users; - Add more Web servers to support more Multiple applications and data storage; - Upgrade the architecture according to the needs of the business without affecting the existing architecture. In short, this infrastructure architecture can support the work needs of the company's employees, protect the security of company data and assets, and can be expanded to meet future growth needs.
