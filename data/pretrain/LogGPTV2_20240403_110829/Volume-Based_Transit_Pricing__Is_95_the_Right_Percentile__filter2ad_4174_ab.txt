Skewness reveals how much the trafﬁc distribution leans to one side of the mean;
for a random variable X: Skewness = E
, where μ is
the mean. If a probability distribution function is unimodal, then higher positive skew
implies few values higher than the mean, i.e., the 95th Percentile value would be closer
to the average. The empirical probability mass function for the trafﬁc of each network
is unimodal for our data sets. Heavy-outbound networks have high positive skew (the
mean is between 5 and 25), especially in the last 4 years2, compared to heavy-inbound
networks or balanced networks, whose mean skewness is between 0 and 12 and 5
and 15, respectively. Similarly, heavy-hitter networks have higher positive skew than
moderate-hitter networks. Table 2 shows the mean skew of trafﬁc for networks at each
IXP, classiﬁed according to dominant trafﬁc direction and trafﬁc volume. As in the
SWITCH dataset, heavy-outbound and heavy-hitter networks generally have a larger
skewness than heavy-inbound and moderate-hitter networks.
In summary, the 95th-to-average ratio has been stable for various classes of networks
in our dataset over the last decade, indicating that a high-percentile billing scheme is
still useful. Certain networks (particularly heavy-outbound and heavy-hitter networks)
are able to achieve a lower 95th Percentile to average ratio (perhaps using intelligent
means of trafﬁc shaping), and hence a lower billing volume for the same total amount

of transit trafﬁc. Trafﬁc smoothing may allow networks to achieve a lower transit bill,
but this says little about the contribution of those networks to the provider’s peak trafﬁc.
The 95th Percentile of a network does not account for when the peaks occur, and so it
is unclear whether it is fair to charge each customer using the same percentile.
4 Fairness of 95th Percentile Billing
Motivated by the preceding discussion, we now focus on the fairness of the 95th Per-
centile billing mechanism. We consider a billing mechanism fair if the amount of re-
sources used by a network is reﬂected in the amount it is charged. An appealing idea in
this context is the Shapley value, which assigns costs to the members in a cooperative
game [9]. It possesses many attractive properties – it is efﬁcient, i.e., the sum of costs
assigned to each member is the total cost to the system, and it is symmetric, i.e., two
members that have the same contribution will be assigned the same cost.
4.1 Shapley Value Percentile Billing
Stanojevic et al. [10] presented a model of the ISP cost allocation problem as a coopera-
tive game. The cost function of a group is the 95th Percentile of the total trafﬁc obtained
by adding the trafﬁc of all members in that group. This cost estimate is consistent with
the idea that the transit provider must provision for peak trafﬁc, and is itself billed by
its provider based on this value. The Shapley value (φi) of network i is then uniquely
π∈Π (V(S(π, i) − V(S(π, i)\i)) where V is the cost function, Π
deﬁned by φi = 1N !
is the set of all possible permutations of players N and S(π, i) is the set of all players
in ordering π before i and including i.

(cid:6)
Once we determine the Shapley value of each network, we need to map it to a billing
percentile. Let the volume corresponding to the 95th Percentile value of the total trafﬁc
be V. Then (by efﬁciency) the Shapley values of the customer networks will satisfy
V =
i φi. Let the volume corresponding to the 95th Percentile of network i be xi.
Then the total volume billed by the transit provider under the 95th Percentile billing
i xi, which we deﬁne as X . Trivially, X ≥ V. For an apples-to-apples
scheme is
comparison between the two billing schemes, we deﬁne the normalized Shapley value
of network i as si = φiX /V, so that the total billing volume in both cases is X . Then
each network can be charged based on a percentile that yields the trafﬁc volume closest
its normalized Shapley value, which is the “Shapley value percentile” of that network.
Computation of the Shapley value is quite complex—with N users, it has complexity
order ofO(N !). Even for a moderate size ISP, which has around 50 users, the complexity
is of the order of 1064. Stanojevic et al. [10] used a Monte Carlo approximation, which
achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and complexity. We used this approximation
to ﬁnd the Shapley value percentile for the SWITCH dataset (month of March 2012) and
the SIX IXP (August 2013). The results are shown in Figure 3. Clearly, the Shapley value
percentiles are widely different from the 95th Percentile .
In addition to computational complexity, the Shapley value percentile can be any-
where between 0 and 100. This approach lacks the ability of restricting the charging
percentiles to a ﬁxed range. The handicaps of directly using the Shapley value motivate
a need for a simple proxy that captures its essence. A key observation is that a trafﬁc
proﬁle has greater Shapley value when it is concentrated during the peak periods when
demand is highest. Thus, Shapley value percentile billing would charge users with high
peak trafﬁc higher than users with off peak trafﬁc.
4.2 Overlap Rank
Building on the intuition developed in the last section that it is fair to charge more to
networks with trafﬁc during peak periods than off-peak periods, we will show how the
current 95th Percentile billing mechanism can lead to unfairness as it does not consider
peak and off-peak periods. We deﬁne the peak periods of a transit provider as those
in which the total trafﬁc carried by the transit provider exceeds the 95th Percentile of
the provider’s total trafﬁc. We similarly deﬁne the peak slots for customer networks.
Based on the number of peak slots of networks that overlap with peak slots of the total
trafﬁc, we rank the networks from highest to lowest and call it the overlap rank. Thus, a
network with rank 0 has the maximum number of peak slots that occur during the same
time intervals as the peak slots of the transit provider. We also rank networks based on
their 95th Percentile and call it the 95th Percentile rank.
Figure 4 plots overlap rank vs. percentile rank (normalized to 100) for the IXP dataset
(ﬁrst 3 plots) and one month (January 2012) from the SWITCH dataset (far right). If
networks with high 95th Percentile rank also had high overlap rank, most points would
appear on the diagonal, and imply that 95th Percentile billing is charging the contrib-
utors who necessitate the provisioning of large transit links. Figure 4 tells a different
story. The points below the diagonal, especially those in the red shaded area (16%
of networks for SWITCH) have a high 95th Percentile rank but a low overlap rank,
which means that their peaks are mostly in the peak period, but their billing volume is

relatively lower. Analogously, the points above the diagonal line, especially in the gray
region (15% of networks for SWITCH) correspond to low 95th Percentile rank and high
overlap rank. Their contribution to the peak period is low but they have a relatively high
billing volume. Similar observations can also be made from the IXP graphs in Figure 4.
4.3 Provision Ratio
The overlap rank considers only the cardinality of overlap slots, without accounting for
diverse trafﬁc volumes. A good proxy for the Shapley value should capture the volume
during peak slots, appropriately normalized with the amount of trafﬁc generated by the
network. We deﬁne the provision ratio (PR) of a network as the ratio of the average
trafﬁc during the peak slots of total trafﬁc to the 95th Percentile of that network’s trafﬁc.
PR of network i = Total trafﬁc of network i during peak slots / # of peak slots
95th Percentile of network i’s trafﬁc
.
The PR is essentially the ratio of trafﬁc contributed by the network during the peak
time slots (or average capacity provided to that network during these peaks) to the peak
trafﬁc of that network (excluding the top 5% of bursts); It can be viewed as the fraction
of a network’s peak trafﬁc that occurs during the provider’s peak periods. We propose
that the PR can be an important component of a billing mechanism, because it captures
the contribution of a network’s trafﬁc to the provider’s peak. The PR is also robust to
the exact thresholds used to compute it – we found that in our datasets, the provision
ratio is robust to the exact threshold for deﬁning a peak slot, e.g., if we change the 95th
Percentile to 85th percentile, the provision ratio does not change signiﬁcantly.
The provision ratio is not equal to the Shapley value percentile in an absolute sense,
but in a relative sense it appears to have the right characteristics. To quantify the simi-
larity between the two, we ﬁnd the percentage of orders preserved between all possible
pairs of networks in both datasets. A transit provider with N customers will have NC2
customer pairs. For each pair, order is preserved if the network that is charged a higher
Shapley percentile also has a higher provision ratio. We ﬁnd that for the SWITCH
dataset, the provision ratio preserves between 76% and 82% of orders in the SWITCH
dataset (each month of 2012) and 89%, 75%, and 82% for the SIX, BIX, and ILAN
IXPs, respectively (August 2013). The strong similarity of orders indicates that provi-
sion ratio is indeed order preserving.

4.4 Towards a New Billing Mechanism
One could argue that the 95th Percentile billing scheme is an approximation, aiming
for simplicity and predictability over fairness. At the other extreme is Shapley value
pricing, which charges each user differently based on their actual contribution to the
provider’s costs. An open challenge is how to achieve both objectives – fairness and
low computational complexity. We are currently exploring the use of the provision
ratio in a scheme that determines the optimal percentile to charge a given customer.
The objective of this scheme would be to vary the billing percentile per customer,
and to use the provision ratio as a measure of the contribution of a customer to the
provider’s peak trafﬁc. This pricing scheme would automatically assign lower billing
percentiles (i.e., give discounts) to customers whose peak trafﬁc does not contribute
signiﬁcantly to the provider’s peak, and higher percentiles to customers that contribute
most to the provider’s peak. An important criterion for such a scheme is that the provider
should be able to communicate information about its peak and off-peak periods to cus-
tomers, without having to make its trafﬁc proﬁle available publicly. For this purpose,
the provider could design a tool that accepts a customer’s trafﬁc proﬁle and analyzes
it in relation to its own trafﬁc to determine the percentile at which it would charge the
customer. Such a scheme would retain the attractive properties of burstable billing (be-
cause it is still based on a billing percentile), while better accounting for a network’s
contribution to total provider costs. Our initial investigation indicates that this problem
can be formulated as a convex optimization, and hence solved efﬁciently.
5 Related Work
While network service pricing has been studied extensively, relatively little work has
focused on speciﬁc mechanisms in the transit business, i.e., volume based pricing based
on the 95th Percentile rule. As early as 1999, Brownlee et al. [11] experimented with
an alternative to the 95th Percentile pricing mechanism, the “third quartile day”, which
they showed was a better estimate of the bandwidth requirements for customers of New
Zealand’s Kawaihiko network. Norton discussed 95th Percentile pricing in his white pa-
pers, particularly the possibility of ISPs gaming the scheme to get free transit [12], and
the impact of streaming video on the statistics of customer trafﬁc [13]. Dmitropoulos et
al. [2] studied the 95th Percentile billing method using trafﬁc traces, and investigated
how the 95th Percentile computed for a given network depends on factors such as the
averaging window size and the effect of ﬂow aggregation. In the context of broadband
users, Stanojevic et al. [10] used the Shapley value approach to quantify the contribu-
tion of each broadband user to the total costs of the access provider. Valancius et al. [14]
proposed that transit providers implement tiered pricing using just a few tiers based on
the volume of trafﬁc and the cost of carrying it to maximize their proﬁts. However, their
approach was targeted at properly structuring pricing tiers, i.e., the price per unit of traf-
ﬁc that the provider charges to a customer. The focus of our work is on the underlying
trafﬁc percentile at which a provider charges its customers.

6 Conclusions
In this paper, our goal was to empirically examine the effectivenvess of the 95th per-
centile pricing scheme, using a decade of historical trafﬁc data from a transit provider
network and more recent data from three European IXPs. Our analysis shows that
over the years, certain networks have lower 95th-to-average ratio than others – for the
datasets we studied, networks with predominantly inbound trafﬁc have higher 95th-to-
average ratios, and would incur a higher billing volume than those with predominantly
outbound trafﬁc (for the same amount of total trafﬁc), and similarly for moderate hitters
vs. heavy hitters. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the 95th percentile pricing scheme can be
unfair, as the 95th Percentile trafﬁc of a network is often unrelated to the amount of time
that network’s peak trafﬁc overlaps that of its provider, nor does it accurately represent
the contribution of that network to the provider’s peak trafﬁc. We deﬁne a new metric,
the Provision Ratio (PR) for a network, which is easy to compute and is able to capture
the contribution of a customer trafﬁc to the provider’s peak.
