My issue is about ...
Sos output is incorrect for analog filter design. I found a comment in
fitler_design.py stating as much, but I would expect an error or clearer
documentation if this is a known limitation. Instead the code below will
generate incorrect SOS coefficients. The combined SOS result in a higher order
analog highpass fitler, not a bandpass.
For this this ticket I suggest adding a simple exception to the library code
to make this obvious. After which, we can open another ticket to add the
feature of correct SOS analog filter design.
#### Reproducing code example:
    BWsos = signal.butter(order,np.array([flow, fhigh]),btype='bandpass', analog=True, output='sos')
#### Scipy/Numpy/Python version information:
version 1.5.4
