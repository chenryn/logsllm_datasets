ref #16560 #15730  
Here is the road-map:
Writing Client-gen:
  * Generate the common methods, ignore the methods operating on subresources for now
  * Unify the signature of the common methods in our individual typed clients
  * Make a test type, then write the test against this type instead of every type
  * manually add the methods that are not common to all typed clients
  * make go2idl track the functions, constants, variables, methods in the input package.
  * add a "plural" namer to go2idl
Using Client-gen:
  * generate the internalversion clientset, to replace pkg/client/clientset/unversioned
  * generate the fake clients to enable testing
  * generate versioned client
Using generated clientset:
  * replace the pkg/client/unversioned/ in controllers
  * replace the pkg/client/unversioned/ in kubelets
  * let controllers use versioned clientset
  * let kubelet use versioned clientset
