ments reveal important relationships between clients and servers: A
moderate number of servers seen by a client (e.g., 2) reveals close
proximity between the client and servers. On the other hand, clients
that are farther away from the Akamai network can see a large num-
ber (e.g., hundreds) of distinct Akamai servers over longer time
scales. In either case, by pointing to the best servers over shorter
time scales, the Akamai CDN reveals valuable path-quality infor-
mation, as we demonstrate in Section 4.
Figure 2 plots the unique Akamai edge-server IP identiﬁcation
numbers (IDs) seen by two clients requesting a943.x.a.yimg
.com, which is a CNAME for Yahoo. The clients are hosted on
the berkeley.intel-research.net and cs.purdue.edu
networks, and the result is shown over a period of two days. We
plot the Akamai server IDs on the y-axis in the order of appear-
ance, i.e., those showing up sooner have lower IDs. As indicated
in the ﬁgure, low-level Akamai DNS servers always return the IP
addresses of two edge servers for redundancy, as explained in the
previous section. Thus, there are always two points in Figure 2
corresponding to each timestamp on the x-axis.
In addition to revealing the targeted number of unique Akamai
server IDs, Figure 2 extracts valuable dynamic information.
In-
deed, both ﬁgures show strong time-of-day effects. During the
evening, both clients are directed to the same set of edge servers;
during the day, the redirections are much more pronounced. In the
next section, we demonstrate that these redirections are driven by
network conditions on the paths between clients and edge servers,
which change more dramatically during the day. In general, the
time-of-day effects are stronger in scenarios where both a client
and its associated Akamai edge servers reside in the same time
zone (e.g., the Berkeley case); as the edge servers become scat-
tered across a larger number of time zones (e.g., the Purdue case),
the effect becomes less pronounced.
The key insight from Figure 2 is the large discrepancy between
the number of unique Akamai edge servers seen by the two hosts.
The Berkeley node is served by fewer than 20 unique edge servers
during the day, indicating that this node and its Akamai servers are
nearby. On the other hand, the lack of Akamai caching servers near
the Purdue PL node signiﬁcantly impacts the number of servers
seen by that node — more than 200 in under two days. The majority
of the servers are from the Midwest or the East Coast (e.g., Boston,
Cambridge, Columbus, or Dover); however, when the paths from
Purdue to these servers become congested, downloads from the
West Coast (e.g., San Francisco or Seattle) are not unusual.
Figure 3 summarizes the number of unique Akamai edge servers
seen by all PL nodes from our experiments requesting the same
CNAME for Yahoo. The number ranges from two (e.g., lbnl.

of servers seen by att.nodes.planet-lab.org. As dis-
cussed above, PL nodes experiencing a low server diversity typi-
cally share the network with Akamai edge servers. From the per-
spective of an overlay network aiming to “draft behind” Akamai,
such PL nodes would be good candidates for mapping to the cor-
responding Akamai servers. Other nodes show either moderate or
large server diversity. In general, the larger the network distance
between a node and its Akamai servers, the larger the number of
edge servers and corresponding network paths. For example, nodes
in Asia or South America regularly see a large number of servers
(e.g., above 50), the majority of which are located in the US; sim-
ilarly, the US PL nodes (e.g., Purdue U. or Columbia U.) that are
not near Akamai “hot spots” also have a large server cardinality.
3.2 The Impact of Akamai Customers on Server
Diversity
In the Akamai CDN, different edge servers may host content for
different customers [24]. Such an arrangement alleviates the load
placed on the servers, thus improving the speed of content deliv-
ery; at the same time, this approach provides a reasonable degree of
server redundancy, which is necessary for resilience to server fail-
ures. Here, we explore how this technique impacts the PL nodes’
server diversity. In essence, we repeat the above experiment, but
query multiple Akamai customers in addition to Yahoo.
Figure 4 depicts the server diversity for a set of ﬁve PL nodes
and ten Akamai customers. For the reasons explained above, both
Purdue and Columbia PL nodes show a large server diversity.
While the actual number of observed servers certainly depends on
the Akamai customer, the cardinality is generally always high for
these two nodes. The exception is FEMA’s (Federal Emergency

Management Agency) web site,2 the content of which is modestly
distributed on the Akamai network; we found only 43 out of over
15,000 Akamai edge servers [4] that host this web site.
Despite the fact that some of our PL nodes are placed on the
same networks as Akamai edge servers, all PL nodes show a large
server diversity for at least one of the Akamai customers. For exam-
ple, Figure 4 indicates that querying Yahoo or The New York
Times from the U. of Oregon reveals a large number of Akamai
servers; likewise, querying Amazon from the UMass or LBNL PL
nodes shows the same result. The bottom line is that because Aka-
mai customers are hosted on different (possibly distinct) sets of
servers, all clients, no matter how close they are to an Akamai
edge server, can see a large number of servers. Most importantly, a
large number of servers enables clients to reveal low-latency Inter-
net paths, as we demonstrate in Section 4.
3.3 Redirection Dynamics
To ensure that clients are updated on the appropriate server to
use, Akamai’s low-level DNS servers set small, 20-second time-
outs for their entries. However, nothing requires a low-level Aka-
mai DNS server to direct clients to a new set of edge servers after
each timeout. Here, we measure the frequency with which low-
level Akamai DNS servers actually change their entries. In the fol-
lowing experiments, the PL nodes query their low-level Akamai
DNS servers by requesting a943.x.a.yimg.com (the CNAME
for Yahoo) every 20 seconds. By comparing the subsequent re-
sponses from the DNS servers, we are able to detect when a DNS
entry is updated and measure the inter-redirection times. Our pri-
mary goal is to verify that the updates are happening at sufﬁciently
short time scales to capture changes in network conditions.

Figure 5 plots the cumulative distribution function (CDF), F (x) =
P r[X ≤ x], of inter-server redirection times for three PL nodes,
located in Berkeley (the same node as in Figure 2(a)), South Ko-
rea, and Brazil. The CDF curve for the Berkeley node represents
the inter-redirection dynamics for the vast majority of nodes in our
PL set. Approximately 50% of the redirections are shorter than
40 seconds, while more than 80% of the redirections are shorter
than 100 seconds. Nevertheless, very long inter-redirection times
also occur, the majority of which are due to the time-of-day effects
explained above.
Not all PL nodes from our set show the above characteristics.
Examples are kaist.ac.kr and pop-ce.rnr.br, which are
also included in Figure 5. The median redirection time is around
4 minutes for the former, and as much as 6 minutes for the latter.
Moreover, the steep changes in the CDF curves reveal the most
probable (still quite long) redirection time scales. Longer redirec-
tion updates can prevent corresponding clients from achieving de-
sirable performance, as we demonstrate below. Still, the summary
statistics for the entire set of 140 PL nodes reveals satisfactory redi-
rection intervals: the median redirection time is below 100 seconds.
4. DOES AKAMAI REVEAL QUALITY
INTERNET PATHS?
Here, we answer one of the key questions relevant to our study:
Do frequent Akamai redirections correlate with network conditions
over the paths between a client and its servers? In an earlier study,
Johnson et al. [16] demonstrated that Akamai generally picks servers
that yield low client-perceived latencies. However, both network-
and server-side effects impact the overall latency, and Akamai claims
to perform and use both measurements to redirect clients to the
closest server [4]. Thus, our goal is to decouple the network side
from the server side to determine which one dominates perfor-
mance. If the server component prevails, then only Akamai’s clients
beneﬁt from redirections. However, if the network component dom-
inates, then redirections reveal network conditions on Internet paths
– information valuable to the broader community of Internet users.
4.1 Methodology
Figure 6 illustrates our measurement methodology for determin-
ing whether Akamai redirections reveal quality Internet paths. As
in the above experiments, each of the 140 nodes sends a DNS
request for one of the Akamai customers every 20 seconds and
records the IP addresses of the edge servers returned by Akamai. In
