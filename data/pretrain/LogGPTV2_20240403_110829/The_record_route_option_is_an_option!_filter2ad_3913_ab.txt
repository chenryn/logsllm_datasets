Table 1: Response rates for pings with/without RR, both total and by AS type. Top shows all probed IP addresses. Bottom counts ASes with
at least one IP address. Of 394,644 ping-responsive IP addresses, 296,734 (75%) also respond to RR. Of 49,100 ASes with at least one
ping-responsive destination, 40,545 (82%) also contain at least one RR-responsive destination.
test allows for some false negatives, which we explore further at the
end of Section 3.3.
3.2 Do Destinations Respond to RR?
The responsiveness results of our measurement study are shown in
Table 1. The bolded entries show the number of destination that were
probed, the number that were ping-responsive, and the number that
were RR-responsive. Of all destinations, 77% are ping-responsive
and 58% are RR-responsive, meaning that 75% of destinations that
respond to ping also respond to ping-RR.
Because different AS types may have different policies and because
different sets of researchers are interested in the behavior of differ-
ent AS types, Table 1 reports responsiveness results by destination
AS type from CAIDA [23]. We find that there is not a substantial
difference across AS types and that the high rate of response holds
across all types: the ratio of RR-responsive
ping-responsive addresses for each type is
over 0.67.
We initially suspected that some ASes would implement AS-wide
policies to filter RR. To investigate, we group the destinations by
AS and classify an AS as ping-responsive or RR-responsive if at
least one address in the AS responded. The bottom three rows of
Table 1 show that 95% of ASes had at least one ping-responsive
destination, and 78% had at least one RR-responsive destination,
meaning that 82% of the ASes that are ping-responsive are also
RR-responsive. This result demonstrates that, while some AS-wide
filtering occurs, most ASes are RR-responsive and thus do not filter
at this granularity.
Our classification of a destination as RR-responsive required a
ping-RR response to one or more VPs. We investigated the distri-
bution of the number of VPs that received a response from each RR-
responsive destination. Roughly 80% of destinations that responded
to at least one VP responded to over 90. This result is consistent
with the finding from previous work that filtering of Options packets
mainly occurred in a small number of edge ASes [8].
3.3 Are Destinations Within the 9 Hop Limit?
We now investigate the utility of the RR Option according to its abil-
ity to measure forward and reverse paths. Our primary reachability
finding is that 66% of RR-responsive destinations are RR-reachable,
i.e., they are within nine hops of their closest VP, and that VP can
measure its complete forward path to the destination. We further

find that at least one vantage point was within 8 hops of nearly 60%
of RR-responsive destinations, offering the potential to measure the
reverse path from them to any other vantage point [11].
Comparing reachability across sets of vantage points. Using
both PlanetLab and M-Lab requires operational overhead from
researchers. When designing systems or conducting studies where
reachability from any VP is a key metric (as is the case when
measuring reverse paths [11]), it is helpful to know the usefulness of
using both platforms. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the distance
from the RR-responsive destinations to the closest VP from various
subsets of VPs. To avoid clutter, we omit the line corresponding
to the full set of M-Lab and PlanetLab VPs; it is within 1% of
the all M-Lab sites line at all points, indicating that PlanetLab
provides little added benefit over M-Lab for this use case. While
M-Lab VPs are within range of 99% of the full set of RR-reachable
destinations, PlanetLab VPs are only within range of 72%. We
suspect a disparity in site placement is responsible—M-Lab VPs
are in centrally-located transit networks and colocation facilities,
while most PlanetLab VPs are hosted in university networks.
Strategically choosing vantage points from other measurement
platforms, such as RIPE Atlas [18], could further improve coverage
into networks out of range of M-Lab. However, Atlas currently does
not allow measurements with IP Options, and their strict rate limits
could complicate the process of finding VPs in range of particular
destinations [5].

Goodchild, et al.
Next, we used scamper [15] to send pings to high-numbered UDP
ports with the RR Option enabled (henceforth ping-RRudp), with
the intent to trigger “port unreachable” error responses. Typically,
when devices generate error messages, they will quote the offending
packet in the response, including the contents of the offending IP
header [16]. By viewing the RR hops recorded in the quoted packet
header, we can determine if the offending packet arrived at the
destination with RR slots available, and thus that the destination
must not honor RR. This methodology allows us to reclassify an
additional 4,358 destinations as RR-reachable.
Using these two techniques, we were able to reclassify a total of
9,995 destinations as RR-reachable, meaning we could potentially
measure their entire forward and reverse paths. We note that the
design of more creative techniques to extract useful information
from RR-based measurements is an open area of research [17], and
the utility of the RR Option increases with each new application.
3.4 Has Reachability Changed Over Time?
We hypothesized that two trends may mean that, collectively, today’s
available VPs are in range of more RR-responsive destinations than
in the past. First, M-Lab now includes machines in a greater number
of locations. Second, M-Lab sites tend to be hosted in colocation
facilities, where an increase in Internet peering over time has the
potential to create shorter paths to more destinations [14, 3].
We compare our 2016 data, which uses 55 Planetlab sites and 86
M-Lab sites to measure 296,734 RR-responsive destinations, to
2011 measurements from 294 Planetlab sites and 14 M-Lab sites to
3,506,984 RR-responsive destinations [11] to. Both sets of destina-
tions were chosen from a contemporaneous list of historically ping-
responsive addresses [7], but the 2011 destinations also included IP
addresses harvested from ping-RR probes [11], guaranteeing that
they are RR-reachable from at least one vantage point. We include
all destinations in our results (not just IP addresses or prefixes that
were common across both dates) because the large gap between
the measurements means that even common addresses may have
been repurposed or relocated. The all VPs lines in Figure 2 show
an increase in the fraction of RR-responsive destinations that were
RR-reachable from 0.12 in 2011 to 0.66 in 2016. The common VPs
lines in the same figure indicates a similar increase even if we just
consider the 34 PlanetLab and 11 M-Lab sites that were used in both
years, suggesting that changes to the set of available VPs cannot
alone account for this difference, and that individual VPs are “closer”
to more destinations than they were in the past.
3.5 Do ASes Refuse to Stamp Packets?
One potential drawback when using RR is missing hops due to
routers not honoring RR, since recent recommendations for best
practices suggest that routers forward packets without recording
their IP addresses [9]. Given these recommendations, we wondered
whether some ASes had globally configured their routers to forward
packets without stamping them. Here we compare RR paths to
traceroute paths at coarse granularity to uncover evidence of such
ASes. We use this analysis as a proxy to estimate the accuracy of
RR at the level of AS hops.
Figure 2: RR hops from closest M-Lab or PlanetLab vantage point
to RR-responsive destinations, in 2011 versus 2016. In 2016, vantage
points tend to reach a higher fraction of RR-responsive destinations
within 9 hops.
In systems where the key metric is distance from the closest VP, it
can be tempting to issue batches of probes from all VPs. Such exhaus-
tive probing techniques introduce large numbers of RR packets into a
network, which may trigger abuse reports or rate limiters (discussed
in Section 4.1). In search of more prudent probing methodologies,
we investigated the trade-off in reachability that comes with restrict-
ing ourselves to small sets of VPs. By greedily selecting M-Lab
sites, we find that we can reach 73% of RR-reachable destinations
with just one site (NYC), 82% with two sites (adding LA), 86% with
three (Denver), 91% with five (Miami and Milan), and 95% with
10. We added lines in Figure 1 comparing some of these subsets.
Not only are 95% of RR-reachable destinations reachable with only
10 VPs, but the majority of destinations are reachable at the same
distance they would be if we were to use the full set. By carefully
choosing small subsets of VPs, we can greatly reduce probing load
while maintaining a high probability of finding a VP of minimal
distance to any RR-reachable destination.
Uncovering Additional Reachability. As noted in Section 3.1, our
analysis determined if destinations were RR-reachable by checking
if the destination IP address appears in the RR response header. This
allows for some false negatives. In this section, we introduce two
situations in which destinations may have been falsely classified,
then describe and briefly evaluate two tests to account for them.
In the first situation, a destination device could record a different
IP address than the one we target [20], a so-called alias. To be able
to identify some of these cases, we performed alias resolution on
the 1,079,779 IP addresses that were RR-responsive destinations
and/or appeared in the RR headers of our measurements. Using
MIDAR [12] we uncovered 48,937 alias sets composed of 205,017
unique IP addresses. With this data we inferred that 5,637 of the
destinations recorded an alias in the RR header, but never recorded
the destination, thus they are RR-reachable.
In the second situation, probes may reach the destination with RR
slots remaining, but the response RR header does not contain any IP
address from the destination because the destination does not honor
RR, a case mentioned in previous work [20]. To detect such instances,
we first composed a set of destinations containing all IP addresses
determined to be RR-responsive but not RR-reachable from any VP.

One approach to discovering when IP hops have been missed due to
routers not honoring RR is to align IP paths recorded using RR to
corresponding traceroutes. However, previous attempts have shown
this to be difficult [20]. Since we were interested in AS-wide behav-
ior, we took a different approach. To test if any ASes systematically
refuse to honor RR, we issued traceroutes from each M-Lab van-
tage point to that VP’s RR-reachable destinations (choosing 10,000
randomly for VPs with more than that). In total, 130,000 distinct
destinations were considered. By restricting our comparison only
to RR-reachable destinations, we were able to avoid the problem of
determining which fraction of the traceroute path was present in RR
(a subset of the path alignment problem).
We compared the AS paths derived from these traceroutes with those
from the corresponding ping-RRs. If an AS consistently appears
in traceroutes, but not in RR, we would have evidence suggesting a
global configuration of routers within that AS to not honor RR. Of
7,185 ASes extracted from these measurements, only two appeared
in traceroute but never RR; 143 were usually seen in both, but not
always; and the vast majority, 7,040 were always present in the RR
path if they were in the corresponding traceroute. This evidence
suggests that operators are not adopting AS-wide policy to forward
RR packets without stamping them. Furthermore, given the high
probability that an AS appears in both traceroute and RR, we are
confident that RR is accurate at the granularity of AS hops.
3.6 Could RR Be Useful to Cloud Providers?
Large content and cloud providers are expanding their infrastructures
to bring content closer to users [3]. As their paths shorten, nine hops
will represent a larger fraction of the round-trip path, and ping-RR
could become an effective way for providers to measure paths back
from their users to their networks (where they lack visibility [13]).
Because we do not have the ability to issue ping-RRs from a cloud
provider,2we instead estimate the number of destinations potentially
RR-reachable from three cloud providers using traceroutes we issued
in August 2015 to destinations around the world. First, we examine
traces we issued in May 2017 from M-Lab VPs to RR-reachable
destinations to give a rough estimate of the distribution of traceroute
path lengths to RR-reachable destinations (a topic further explored
in Section 4.1). Next, for each cloud provider, we calculate a distri-
bution of traceroute path lengths to compare to the M-Lab traceroute
length distributions, to roughly calibrate whether the distributions
suggest that many are RR-reachable. To do so, we first select all
destinations from the 2015 traceroutes that are in the same /24 prefix
as a destination that is RR-responsive in 2017, since destinations
in a prefix generally share similar paths from a vantage point. By
equating destinations in the same /24, we can expand the set of desti-
nations for which we have measurements in both M-Lab ping-RRs,
and cloud-issued traceroutes. Based on our experience issuing mea-
