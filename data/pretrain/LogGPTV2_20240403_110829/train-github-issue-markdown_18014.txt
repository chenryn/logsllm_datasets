By adding `numpy==1.20.2` to the `requirements.txt` file, the following issue can be resolved:

```

During the handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

aws_lambda_builders.actions.ActionFailedError: {numpy==1.20.3(wheel)}

Build Failed
```

**Explanation:**
The error indicates that the AWS SAM CLI is unable to find a compatible wheel for `numpy==1.20.3`. By specifying `numpy==1.20.2` in the `requirements.txt` file, the build process will use a version of NumPy that has a compatible wheel, thus resolving the dependency issue and allowing the build to succeed.
