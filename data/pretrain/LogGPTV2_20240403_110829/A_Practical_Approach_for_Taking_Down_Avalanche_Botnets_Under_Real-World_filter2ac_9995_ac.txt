### Blacklists and Commercial Providers
Blacklists [54], [81], [101] are commonly used to identify potentially malicious domains. Additionally, commercial providers publish lists of popular websites, which serve as a baseline for seemingly benign domains [56]. These services may be crawled to populate search engine results or to archive web content [37]. The latter enables longitudinal analyses of malicious activity [12], [83], [101]. By combining these methods, risk scores can be calculated for each domain [43].

### Service Unavailability and Domain Expiration
The unavailability of services offered by a domain, whether intentional or due to misconfigurations, can be detected using the previously discussed data sets, depending on the type of disruption. When a domain is no longer needed, it may expire. Domains set to expire are often monitored for drop-catching [39], which involves registering the domain as quickly as possible after it expires. Malicious actors sometimes reuse expired domains to capitalize on their existing reputation [57], [97]. Alternatively, a service may be interrupted or a domain may be made unavailable for legal reasons, such as in takedown operations. Since our study focuses on domains before they are taken down, we do not consider this final step in our feature set.

### General Insights
Our goal is to design features that highlight the contrasting properties of benign and malicious domains, providing more accurate classification while adhering to the constraints of the Avalanche takedown use case (as outlined in Section III-B). This requires an understanding of the generic differences in behavior between legitimate and malicious actors regarding their domains. We select features to capture the following three characteristics:

1. **Likelihood of Collisions**: Given that all domains are algorithmically generated, we aim to find "regular" (least random) looking domains, as they are more likely to collide with benign domains. This approach contrasts with other work that focuses on detecting DGAs based on the randomness of domain names [77], [78], [85], [96].

2. **Investment in the Domain**: Obtaining and maintaining a domain requires investment from its owner, both monetary (registration fees) and effort (setting up DNS and WHOIS records, installing services). Benign owners value their domains and are willing to make this investment, while malicious actors aim to minimize costs and effort to maximize revenue. Indicators of high investment include long-term registration (benign domains tend to be older, while malicious ones are often registered shortly before the validity period [19], [20], [36], [71]) and valid DNS and WHOIS records (invalid, obfuscated, or repeated values suggest malicious practices [93]).

3. **Website Popularity**: Establishing a popular website requires significant effort in creating content and building an audience. Website popularity is thus an indication of benignness: malicious actors are unlikely to invest in real websites on dormant domains, especially since it is not necessary for botnet operations. Regular users and web crawlers are also unlikely to visit these domains. If a domain has not yet been generated by a DGA, its traffic is low or non-existent, suggesting that any traffic it draws is likely legitimate.

### Summary of Feature Sets
We aim to capture a comprehensive view of the domain lifecycle for classification, selecting features and data sources accordingly, guided by our general insights. While some features may be useful, they are not applicable to our use case or would have unwanted consequences for data collection or wider applicability. We discuss the reasons for excluding these features in Section IV-D.

Table IV summarizes the 36 features we compute, categorized into six feature sets. For each feature set, we describe what it represents, which features it includes, how it is obtained, and its coverage. We indicate for each feature:
1. Whether it is binary or continuous.
2. Whether higher or true values indicate a benign or malicious domain (based on intuition).
3. Which lifecycle step from Section IV-A it covers.
4. Which insight from Section IV-B it illustrates.

For each domain, we know the start and end dates of the validity period, i.e., when the respective DGA would generate the domain. We also retrieve the date when a malware family started being active from DGArchive [71], where available.

#### Lexical Features
- **Domain Name Length**: Shorter domains tend to be more popular and expensive.
- **Digit Ratio**: Domains with more digits tend to be less readable. Both features exclude the TLD.

#### Popularity-Based Features
- **Number of Unique Pages Captured**: Using the Wayback Machine API, we capture the number of unique pages, the time between the first page capture and the takedown, and the time between the first capture and the start of the DGA validity period.

#### Presence in Top Websites Rankings
- **Alexa, Majestic, Quantcast, and Umbrella Rankings**: These rankings approximate popularity from different vantage points (web browser visits, incoming links, tracking script/ISP data, and DNS traffic). Although they can contain malicious domains and are susceptible to manipulation [56], presence in these lists still indicates benign intent. Historical data is retrieved from an archive of top websites [76].

#### Certificate Transparency Feature
- **TLS Certificate in Logs**: Whether Certiﬁcate Transparency logs contain a valid TLS certificate for the domain. Data is obtained through an API from Entrust, which tracks Google Certiﬁcate Transparency logs [63].

#### WHOIS Features
- **Registration Cycle and Registrant Details**: Features based on the time between the WHOIS creation date and the start of the DGA validity period, the start of malware family activity, the takedown date, and the WHOIS expiration date. Additional features include domain renewal, use of privacy/proxy services, disposable email addresses, and the validity of the registrant phone number. WHOIS-based features use historical data from DomainTools, reflecting a state before the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation.

#### Passive DNS Features
- **Period and Frequency of DNS Resolutions**: Features capturing the number of passive DNS queries, the time between the first and last seen passive DNS query, and the time between the first seen passive DNS query and the takedown or the start of the DGA validity period.

By combining these features, we aim to provide a robust and accurate classification of benign and malicious domains.
