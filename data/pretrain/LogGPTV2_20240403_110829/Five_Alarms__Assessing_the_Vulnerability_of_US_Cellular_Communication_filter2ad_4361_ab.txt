hazards.
We begin by analyzing the spatial coincidence of observed
wildfires and cell transceivers in the conterminous US. We do
this by identifying cell transceiver locations that fall within
the perimeters of all historical wildfires in the US on an
annual basis. For our historical analysis, we assume that any
Figure 3: Wildfire perimeters from 2000 to 2018.
cell transceiver inside a wildfire perimeter was in danger of
loss of service from direct or indirect effects of wildfires.
We also present a case study of the California power black-
outs of fall 2019 to illustrate three specific threats to cellular
infrastructure from wildfire: direct physical damage; loss
of backhaul transport; and power blackouts. We used the
reports from cellular service providers to the Federal Commu-
nications Commission (FCC) during the California fires. The
reports detail the impact of power outages and wildfires to
their infrastructure in 37 counties and enable quantification
of the impacts on cell service from each of these threats.
Next we identify cellular infrastructure in the US that is
currently most at risk, using WHP data overlaid with the cell
transceiver locations. From this analysis, we categorize the
most at-risk cell infrastructure as being in very high, high,
or moderate danger from wildfires.
Finally, to describe the potential effects of losing any part
of this at-risk cellular infrastructure, we took the output from
the previous step, and rank-ordered these cell transceivers
by the approximate number of customers that they serve. We
use US Census data [2] to identify each county population
in the conterminous US and then overlay with at-risk cell
infrastructure in the highest-population counties to provide
an index of potential wildfire impacts on cell service.
3 RESULTS
3.1 Historical Analysis
We quantify the extent of wildfires in the United States from
2000 to 2018 using the annual GeoMAC wildfire perimeter
data set. Figure 3 shows all wildfire perimeters from 2000 to
2018. Fires were concentrated in the western US, but there
were pockets of wildfire activity in other regions, such as the
southeast throughout Florida and along the Carolina coast.
Next, we identify cellular infrastructure that may have
been affected by wildfires. As depicted in Figure 4, between
2000 and 2018, there were over 27,000 cell transceivers within
wildfire perimeters.
Although many cell transceivers are geographically lo-
cated within the perimeter of past wildfires, details of the
damage caused by the fires are unknown. Indeed, location
within a wildfire perimeter does not prove that a transceiver
was damaged or destroyed. However, we argue that any
transceiver inside the perimeter of a wildfire is at risk, either
directly or indirectly as illustrated below.
Summary of key findings. Every year since 2000, there
were at least 180 cell transceivers within wildfire perimeters.
There is no simple relationship between the number of wild-
fires or acres burned and the number of cell transceivers at
risk.
3.2 Case Study: 2019 California Wildfires
In the fall of 2019, low humidity and strong Santa Ana winds
provided the conditions for major fire events in California.
The Kincade Fire burned from 23 October until 6 Novem-
ber, through 77,000 acres north of the San Francisco Bay
Area.[3] Simultaneously, the Getty Fire burned through 745
acres outside Los Angeles from 28 October until 5 November,
destroying 10 residences and damaging an additional 15 [6].
On 25 October, the FCC activated the Disaster Informa-
tion Reporting System (DIRS) for 37 counties in California
in order to monitor the effects of planned and unplanned
power blackouts on telecommunication infrastructure. DIRS
is a voluntary initiative in which mobile Internet (i.e., cel-
lular service providers), fixed Internet (i.e., cable or Digital
Subscriber Line (DSL) service), television, and phone compa-
nies can self-report on the status of their networks to help
coordinate disaster relief efforts [4].
The most striking observation from this case study is how
vulnerable cell service is to loss of power. Most cell sites
depend on a single power source. For example, on 28 October,
of the 874 cell sites out of service, 702 (over 80%) were due
to loss of power. The FCC made a similar observation after
Hurricane Katrina in 2005 [1] when it proposed requiring
The DIRS collected data from 25 October through 1 No-
vember, 2019. A summary of each dayâ€™s outages is shown
in Figure 5. During that period, up to 874 cell sites were out
of service, some for the entire eight-day reporting period.
Further, there were still 110 cell sites out of service, including
21 damaged, as of 1 November.
The FCC divided the reasons for the service outages into
three different categories: (1) Damage and destruction. This
category pertains when equipment is rendered inoperable,
including support equipment such as towers, guy lines, and
mountings. (2) Loss of power. Cell sites maintain limited
battery power backup in case of temporary power outages,
but most do not maintain any long-term on-site power gen-
eration. (3) Loss of backhaul capability. Cell sites must be
connected to the Internet through fiber optic cable or high-
capacity microwave wireless links.

2000 to 2018.
Table 1 shows annual statistics for number of fires, acres
burned, and cell transceivers inside wildfire perimeters in
the US. More than 45,000 wildfires burn over 3 million acres
every year, with the exact numbers and damage varying
based on the complex interactions of people, ecosystems and
the weather conditions leading up to and through each fire
season. The results show that hundreds to thousands of cell
transceivers are within wildfire perimeters each year. At the
lowest in 2010, there were more than 180 cell transceivers
within wildfire perimeters, while at the other extreme, 2007
had almost 5,000 transceivers within wildfire perimeters.
More than 1,000 cell transceivers were within a wildfire
perimeter in seven of the past 20 years.

cellular service providers to maintain backup power at their
cell sites, but these recommendations were ultimately not
implemented [20].
Summary of key findings. There are three categories of
threats to cell sites from wildfires, listed from highest threat
to lowest: (1) power outages, (2) loss of backhaul connectivity,
(3) cell site damage. Each of these must be considered in
developing mitigation strategies.
3.3 Wildfire Hazard Potential Analysis
The Wildfire Hazard Potential map is our starting point to
identify the areas where wildfires pose a threat to cellular
transceivers in the US. This map shows the WHP for each
270x270 meter geographic block in the conterminous US. To
focus our analysis on the highest-threat areas, we disregard
the non-burnable, very low, and low WHP areas. As seen
in Figure 6, the moderate, high, and very high risk areas
are spread across much of the country, particularly in the
west and southeast. Most of the very high WHP areas are
geographically intermingled with, and often surrounded by,
high and moderate WHP areas.
Figure 7 shows the results of our geospatial analysis of
cellular transceivers that are located within the top three
levels of WHP danger areas by state. Our analysis reveals
that almost all very high, high, or moderate WHP areas
contain at least one cell transceiver. We find that there are
261,569 (moderate), 142,968 (high), and 26,307 (very high)
cell transceivers in the respective WHP areas. Figure 8 shows
a breakdown of cell transceivers in moderate to very high
WHP areas by state. There are seven states with more than
Figure 6: Conterminous US Wildfire Hazard Potential
(WHP). Areas at highest risk in red and yellow; areas
of lowest risk in black and green.
5,000 cell transceivers in moderate WHP risk areas (listed
from most to least): California, Florida, Texas, South Carolina,
Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona. All of these states
except Arizona also have more than 5,000 cell transceivers in
high WHP risk areas. Figure 9 shows the distribution of cell
transceivers in WHP areas on a per capita basis. From this
perspective, New Mexico replaces Texas on the list of high-
risk states with at least one at-risk transceiver per thousand
people. The states with the most transceivers per thousand
people in WHP very high areas are (from most to least): Utah,
Florida, California, Nevada, and New Mexico.
Summary of key findings. Combining the Wildfire Haz-
ard Potential with cell transceiver locations is an effective
metric for identifying high risk infrastructure. WHP-based
analysis identifies 430,844 cell transceivers in high risk areas.
3.4 Validation of WHP to Determine
Cellular Infrastructure Risk
The WHP map was last updated in 2018 to incorporate pre-
vious wildfires and current climate conditions. To validate
our use of WHP as the basis for identifying cellular infras-
tructure that is at risk, we compared the cell infrastructure
that was identified as being at risk from the WHP map with
the the cellular infrastructure that was located inside of 2019
wildfire perimeters. In 2019 there were 656 cell transceivers
inside wildfire perimeters in the conterminous US. Of these,
302 (46%) were located inside regions with very high, high, or
moderate wildfire hazard potential. As this was lower than
anticipated, we further identified the locations of the 354 cell
transceivers that were not inside of high-risk WHP areas.
Of these 354 transceivers, 288 were within the 2019 Saddle
Ridge Fire or Tick Fire perimeters on the north side of Los
Angeles. These 288 transceivers were located either at the
perimeter of the wildfire closer to developed infrastructure
Figure 7: Transceivers located in (left) Moderate WHP; (center) High WHP; (right) Very High WHP areas.
Figure 8: States with the most cell transceivers in Mod-
erate, High and Very High risk WHP areas
or along roads that intersected the wildfires. The WHP con-
siders roads and urban areas as being at lower wildfire risk
because they contain less wildfire fuel. If we discard these
288 transceivers, the 2018 WHP accurately identified 84% of
cell transceivers that were inside wildfire perimeters in 2019.
This validation demonstrates limitations of our approach,
but also identified the importance of focusing preventative
and protective measures on the most at-risk infrastructure.
The WHP correctly identified the outskirts of Los Angeles
as having many areas at elevated wildfire risk, including
much of the area inside both the Saddle Ridge and Tick
Fire perimeters. It also correctly identified urban areas at
lower risk of wildfires. However, because we know that cell
infrastructure is often installed along roads or on buildings,
WHP will necessarily provide a lower bound for cellular
infrastructure that is at risk. Similarly, WHP provides an
assessment of the risk for wildfires at particular locations
Figure 9: Cell transceivers per capita in Moderate,
High and Very High risk WHP areas
but does not account for the likelihood of a wildfire starting
in a high-risk area and spreading to lower-risk areas.
Summary of key findings. WHP correctly predicted
46% of cell transceivers that were inside of wildfire perime-
ters in 2019. Of the 354 transceivers inside of wildfire perime-
ters not identified as being at risk, 288 were inside two wild-
fire perimeters on the north side of Los Angeles that included
a major roadway. This finding suggests an approach to ex-
tending perimeters of WHP areas identified as very high to
improve risk projections.
3.5 Cellular Service Provider Risk
To quantify the risk for specific cellular service providers,
we identify the service provider associated with transceivers
in the most at-risk WHP regions and then determine the
