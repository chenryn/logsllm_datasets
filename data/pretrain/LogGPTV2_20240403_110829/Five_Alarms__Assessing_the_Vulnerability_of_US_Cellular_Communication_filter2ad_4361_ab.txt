### Hazards and Wildfire Impacts on Cellular Infrastructure

#### 1. Introduction
We begin by analyzing the spatial coincidence of observed wildfires and cell transceivers in the contiguous United States. This is achieved by identifying cell transceiver locations that fall within the perimeters of all historical wildfires on an annual basis. For our historical analysis, we assume that any cell transceiver inside a wildfire perimeter was at risk of service disruption due to direct or indirect effects of wildfires.

We also present a case study of the California power blackouts in the fall of 2019 to illustrate three specific threats to cellular infrastructure from wildfires: direct physical damage, loss of backhaul transport, and power blackouts. We used reports from cellular service providers to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during the California fires. These reports detail the impact of power outages and wildfires on their infrastructure in 37 counties and enable quantification of the impacts on cell service from each of these threats.

Next, we identify cellular infrastructure in the US that is currently most at risk, using Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) data overlaid with cell transceiver locations. From this analysis, we categorize the most at-risk cell infrastructure as being in very high, high, or moderate danger from wildfires.

Finally, to describe the potential effects of losing any part of this at-risk cellular infrastructure, we rank-ordered these cell transceivers by the approximate number of customers they serve. We use US Census data to identify each county population in the contiguous US and then overlay this with at-risk cell infrastructure in the highest-population counties to provide an index of potential wildfire impacts on cell service.

##### 2.1 Historical Analysis
We quantify the extent of wildfires in the United States from 2000 to 2018 using the annual GeoMAC wildfire perimeter dataset. Figure 3 shows all wildfire perimeters from 2000 to 2018. Fires were concentrated in the western US, but there were pockets of wildfire activity in other regions, such as the southeast throughout Florida and along the Carolina coast.

Next, we identify cellular infrastructure that may have been affected by wildfires. As depicted in Figure 4, between 2000 and 2018, there were over 27,000 cell transceivers within wildfire perimeters. Although many cell transceivers are geographically located within the perimeter of past wildfires, details of the damage caused by the fires are unknown. Indeed, location within a wildfire perimeter does not prove that a transceiver was damaged or destroyed. However, we argue that any transceiver inside the perimeter of a wildfire is at risk, either directly or indirectly.

**Summary of key findings:**
- Every year since 2000, there were at least 180 cell transceivers within wildfire perimeters.
- There is no simple relationship between the number of wildfires or acres burned and the number of cell transceivers at risk.

##### 2.2 Case Study: 2019 California Wildfires
In the fall of 2019, low humidity and strong Santa Ana winds provided the conditions for major fire events in California. The Kincade Fire burned from October 23 to November 6, through 77,000 acres north of the San Francisco Bay Area. Simultaneously, the Getty Fire burned through 745 acres outside Los Angeles from October 28 to November 5, destroying 10 residences and damaging an additional 15.

On October 25, the FCC activated the Disaster Information Reporting System (DIRS) for 37 counties in California to monitor the effects of planned and unplanned power blackouts on telecommunication infrastructure. DIRS is a voluntary initiative in which mobile Internet (i.e., cellular service providers), fixed Internet (i.e., cable or Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service), television, and phone companies can self-report on the status of their networks to help coordinate disaster relief efforts.

The most striking observation from this case study is how vulnerable cell service is to loss of power. Most cell sites depend on a single power source. For example, on October 28, of the 874 cell sites out of service, 702 (over 80%) were due to loss of power. The FCC made a similar observation after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 when it proposed requiring cellular service providers to maintain backup power at their cell sites, but these recommendations were ultimately not implemented.

The DIRS collected data from October 25 through November 1, 2019. A summary of each dayâ€™s outages is shown in Figure 5. During that period, up to 874 cell sites were out of service, some for the entire eight-day reporting period. Further, there were still 110 cell sites out of service, including 21 damaged, as of November 1.

The FCC divided the reasons for the service outages into three different categories:
1. **Damage and destruction:** Equipment is rendered inoperable, including support equipment such as towers, guy lines, and mountings.
2. **Loss of power:** Cell sites maintain limited battery power backup in case of temporary power outages, but most do not maintain any long-term on-site power generation.
3. **Loss of backhaul capability:** Cell sites must be connected to the Internet through fiber optic cable or high-capacity microwave wireless links.

Table 1 shows annual statistics for the number of fires, acres burned, and cell transceivers inside wildfire perimeters in the US. More than 45,000 wildfires burn over 3 million acres every year, with the exact numbers and damage varying based on the complex interactions of people, ecosystems, and weather conditions leading up to and through each fire season. The results show that hundreds to thousands of cell transceivers are within wildfire perimeters each year. At the lowest in 2010, there were more than 180 cell transceivers within wildfire perimeters, while at the other extreme, 2007 had almost 5,000 transceivers within wildfire perimeters. More than 1,000 cell transceivers were within a wildfire perimeter in seven of the past 20 years.

**Summary of key findings:**
- There are three categories of threats to cell sites from wildfires, listed from highest threat to lowest: (1) power outages, (2) loss of backhaul connectivity, (3) cell site damage. Each of these must be considered in developing mitigation strategies.

##### 2.3 Wildfire Hazard Potential Analysis
The Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) map is our starting point to identify the areas where wildfires pose a threat to cellular transceivers in the US. This map shows the WHP for each 270x270 meter geographic block in the contiguous US. To focus our analysis on the highest-threat areas, we disregard the non-burnable, very low, and low WHP areas. As seen in Figure 6, the moderate, high, and very high risk areas are spread across much of the country, particularly in the west and southeast. Most of the very high WHP areas are geographically intermingled with, and often surrounded by, high and moderate WHP areas.

Figure 7 shows the results of our geospatial analysis of cellular transceivers that are located within the top three levels of WHP danger areas by state. Our analysis reveals that almost all very high, high, or moderate WHP areas contain at least one cell transceiver. We find that there are 261,569 (moderate), 142,968 (high), and 26,307 (very high) cell transceivers in the respective WHP areas. Figure 8 shows a breakdown of cell transceivers in moderate to very high WHP areas by state. There are seven states with more than 5,000 cell transceivers in moderate WHP risk areas (listed from most to least): California, Florida, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona. All of these states except Arizona also have more than 5,000 cell transceivers in high WHP risk areas. Figure 9 shows the distribution of cell transceivers in WHP areas on a per capita basis. From this perspective, New Mexico replaces Texas on the list of high-risk states with at least one at-risk transceiver per thousand people. The states with the most transceivers per thousand people in WHP very high areas are (from most to least): Utah, Florida, California, Nevada, and New Mexico.

**Summary of key findings:**
- Combining the Wildfire Hazard Potential with cell transceiver locations is an effective metric for identifying high-risk infrastructure. WHP-based analysis identifies 430,844 cell transceivers in high-risk areas.

##### 2.4 Validation of WHP to Determine Cellular Infrastructure Risk
The WHP map was last updated in 2018 to incorporate previous wildfires and current climate conditions. To validate our use of WHP as the basis for identifying cellular infrastructure at risk, we compared the cell infrastructure identified as being at risk from the WHP map with the cellular infrastructure located inside 2019 wildfire perimeters. In 2019, there were 656 cell transceivers inside wildfire perimeters in the contiguous US. Of these, 302 (46%) were located inside regions with very high, high, or moderate wildfire hazard potential. As this was lower than anticipated, we further identified the locations of the 354 cell transceivers that were not inside high-risk WHP areas.

Of these 354 transceivers, 288 were within the 2019 Saddle Ridge Fire or Tick Fire perimeters on the north side of Los Angeles. These 288 transceivers were located either at the perimeter of the wildfire closer to developed infrastructure or along roads that intersected the wildfires. The WHP considers roads and urban areas as being at lower wildfire risk because they contain less wildfire fuel. If we discard these 288 transceivers, the 2018 WHP accurately identified 84% of cell transceivers that were inside wildfire perimeters in 2019.

This validation demonstrates limitations of our approach but also identified the importance of focusing preventative and protective measures on the most at-risk infrastructure. The WHP correctly identified the outskirts of Los Angeles as having many areas at elevated wildfire risk, including much of the area inside both the Saddle Ridge and Tick Fire perimeters. It also correctly identified urban areas at lower risk of wildfires. However, because we know that cell infrastructure is often installed along roads or on buildings, WHP will necessarily provide a lower bound for cellular infrastructure that is at risk. Similarly, WHP provides an assessment of the risk for wildfires at particular locations but does not account for the likelihood of a wildfire starting in a high-risk area and spreading to lower-risk areas.

**Summary of key findings:**
- WHP correctly predicted 46% of cell transceivers that were inside of wildfire perimeters in 2019.
- Of the 354 transceivers inside of wildfire perimeters not identified as being at risk, 288 were inside two wildfire perimeters on the north side of Los Angeles that included a major roadway. This finding suggests an approach to extending perimeters of WHP areas identified as very high to improve risk projections.

##### 2.5 Cellular Service Provider Risk
To quantify the risk for specific cellular service providers, we identify the service provider associated with transceivers in the most at-risk WHP regions and then determine the potential impact on their service.
