to observe the correct combination being entered by an authorized 
user. Optical decoding uses tools like borescopes or otoscopes to 
look inside the lock at the internal components. Optics can be used to 
look at the size, shape, color, alignment, and spacing of internal 
components. In the photo (right), pin-tumblers can be decoded 
because they are color-coded to make self-rekeying easier.
Radiological imaging is a form of surreptitious decoding that uses penetrating radiation (X, beta, and 
gamma rays) to "see" inside the lock or safe, revealing the proper positions of components. This is most 
often used against rotary combination locks to determine the position of each gate in the wheel pack. 
While very effective against many combination locks, it is expensive and only used by medium-high skill 
attackers.
Thermal imaging is another form of surreptitious decoding that uses special devices to look at thermal 
residue left on keypad or pushbutton combination locks. This reveals buttons recently pushed, but may 
not directly reveal the combination sequence. Like radiological imaging, this is generally not used by low 
skill attackers.
As you can see, decoding is a vast array of techniques with forensic evidence equally varied. 
Manipulation-based decoding tools provide forensic evidence that is similar to lockpicking, but may vary 
depending on the specific techniques. Examination of keys may leave forensic evidence depending on the 
type of tools used. Visual, optical, radiological, and thermal decoding are all considered surreptitious and 
leave no lock related forensic evidence.
Bypass
Bypass is a form of covert entry that attempts to circumvent the security of the lock by attacking the cam, 
bolt, or locking knobs directly. While lockpicking focuses on defeating the security of the lock through 
manipulation of components, bypass goes directly to retracting the bolt without affecting the integrity of 
the components. Certain bypass techniques are also forms of destructive entry, but bypass generally refers 
to non-destructive methods.
Attacks against the cam or actuator are a class of bypass that is surprisingly effective. In this attack, a 
poorly designed cam or actuator may be manipulated without affecting components. This vulnerability is 
somewhat uncommon, but extremely effective and easy to do when present. Because tools must generate 
a mild amount of torque as well as travel through the plug, they leave distinct tool marks.
Spring loaded bolts or latches are subject to an attack known as shimming. In shimming, a wedge is used 
to separate the bolt from the spring, or the bolt from the recess (such as in a door). The classic credit card 
trick to open doors is a popular example of this technique. Low-security padlocks are also commonly 
susceptible to shimming of the shackle. Shimming against doors is also known as loiding.
Forensic Evidence
Cam manipulation is one of the most common bypass methods. The American 700 (old models) suffer 
from this vulnerability. Essentially, the cylinder is not required to move in order to actuate the cam. In the 
photo (left), tool marks left on the cam and back plate indicate that bypass was used as the method of 
entry.
In response to the above attack American Lock issued a hardware patch to prevent the bypass method. It 
is just a small metal disc, and in the photo (right) we can see tool marks from where bypass was 
attempted. The 700 has since been redesigned because another attack against this component makes 
bypass again possible.
Key Analysis
While investigation of locks is important, it is more common that the keying system has been 
compromised. Much like the cryptography world, systems are not usually broken by some awe-inspiring 
flaw but instead by the simple act of obtaining the proper keys. The keys to a specific lock can yield just 
as much information as the lock itself, sometimes more so because of the possibility of hair, fiber, and 
fingerprint transfer when handling keys. While examination of locks is excellent for determining the 
method of entry, examination of keys is doubly excellent for the identification of suspects.
When the forensic locksmith receives a key, they examine it in a variety of ways to determine its 
characteristics, place of original, history, and any evidence that may help to determine how it has been 
used. The cuts, keyway, and codes on a key are always examined for information.
Many keys have codes that identify cuts and keyway. Bitting codes may be direct (literal) or indirect 
(obfuscated). In the case of indirect codes, the manufacturer may be able to determine to whom and 
where the key belongs. Other information may also be stamped on the key, such as the name of lock 
brand, key brand, or the locksmith/hardware store that produced the key. All of which may be used to 
identify a suspect.
The material of a key is also important to many forensic investigations. The material of a key can identify 
factory original keys, and in some cases specific third-party manufacturers. Certain manufacturers use 
proprietary alloys to increase longevity and strength of their keys, some of which can be traced back to 
them. The plating on a key also provides some clues. Manufacturers usually plate factory-original keys 
after they are cut, while locksmiths and hardware stores will remove the plating of a blank key when 
making cuts. The plating material may also be used to identify the key blank manufacturer.
Key Duplication
Keys can be duplicated in many ways, but the most common is duplication by hand or with a key 
machine. Identifying an original vs. duplicate key is an important function of the forensic locksmith. In 
addition, the forensic locksmith may be able to determine if the key was recently duplicated. Which of 
these two photos shows the original key, and which is the duplicate. Why?
In this photo (right), the duplicate key is shown. Notice that the ramps and valleys of the key are slightly 
different than the previous photo. In addition, we see that the key is nickel-silver plated, with no plating 
on the cuts. Depending on the factory-original specifics, this may also indicate that it is a duplicate key.
When a key is duplicated with a stylus-based key machine a mark is left on the side of the original key 
(left). This is due to the stylus being gently dragged against the key, and resembles a long, straight, 
polished line. This cannot be confused with wear of the key because it is not in the direct center of the 
key.
Keys can be examined to determine the speed and blade design of the key machine was used to cut them. 
This photo (right) shows a comparison of two keys, with the one of the left being cut with a lower speed 
key cutter. If a key machine is found with a suspect, it can be examined to determine if it was used to cut 
a specific key.
Handmade Keys
Possession of keys that are made by hand are, in a general sense, somewhat suspicious. In most cases 
hand made keys are easily identified by measuring the ramp angles, shoulder to first cut distance, and the 
distance between cuts. Hand-made keys generally have imperfect, jagged ramp angles and poorly spaced 
cuts.
In this photo (center) we see many groups of scratches, with slightly different angles, across the bitting of 
the key. This is consistent with the use of a file. Specifically, this is a flat file being used on the broad 
side. With a tool mark comparison we can determine the size, shape, and grade of the file(s) used.
In this photo (right) we see a series of cuts with variable depth valleys and light material removal around 
the edges. This is consistent with use of a dremel. Again, tool mark comparison can determine exactly 
which dremel bit(s) may have been used. These can be linked with tools found in a suspects possessions.
Tool Mark Identification
Sometimes marks will be left on the key as a result of normal or malicious use. When a key is duplicated 
with a cutter, the clamp to hold the original or the blank may leave a mark. In addition, some covert entry 
techniques may leave tool marks. In this photo (left) we see a set of rather deep marks on the bow.
Close up (center) we see a distinct pattern on the largest tool mark. We can hypothesize what made this, 
and perform a tool mark comparison to confirm. This particular mark was made by a pair of vice grips 
being used to impression (via manipulation) a blank key. The key should also be examined for 
impressioning marks.
In many covert entry techniques a key is used as a tool to affect entry. Keys with unusual marks or 
deformations can provide clues as to their use or intended purpose. In this photo (right), the shoulder of 
the key is deformed and compressed. This happens to be a bump key's shoulder, caused by impact against 
the face of the lock.
Material Transfer
Various materials are transferred to the key during use. Generally hair, fiber, and fingerprints will be 
examined by a crime lab. The forensic locksmith, however, may examine the findings of the crime lab to 
identify the uses of materials found on keys. In this photo (left) we see a light green residue, which 
happens to be modeling clay.
In this photo (center) we find small traces of white wax left in the warding of the key. Both this and the 
previous image indicate that the key has been impressioned (via copying). Through further analysis we 
may be able to link these and other materials to those found in a suspects possessions.
Keys should also be viewed under various light sources to fight material residue that may not be visible 
with the naked eye. In this photo (right), a key is being viewed under ultraviolet light to discover traces of 
ultraviolet ink along the key bitting area, indicative of impressioning via manipulation.
Anti-Forensics & Surreptitious Entry
Forensics is a never ending cat and mouse game. Investigators look for better methods to determine what 
happened while attackers are look for better ways to cover their tracks. So called 'anti-forensics' are 
various techniques and methods to conceal evidence of entry.
In many cases the forensic locksmith is asked to provide an assessment of how plausible certain 
surreptitious entry techniques are against a given lock. This can be done through a series of laboratory 
tests, an analysis of the required skills, tools, or money required, and examination of the installation and 
configuration details of the lock. Cases of completely surreptitious entry are viewed by the investigators 
on the basis of what facts and logical conclusions present themselves.
The idea of anti-forensics materials in tools is a popular but not well researched (publicly) area. Lock 
picks made of soft materials such as wood or plastic would, in theory, not leave any marks on the 
considerably stronger brass, nickel-silver, or steel components. While they sound great in theory, they are 
considerably harder to use in practice. Tools made of these materials are considerably weaker, less 
maneuverable, and more prone to fracture or breakage than the steel normally used in tools. These types 
of tools also exhibit drastically reduced feedback capabilities, important in many covert entry techniques, 
when compared to metal. Coating standard tools with other materials has also been attempted, with 
limited success. The best example is Teflon coated lock picks, which do not leave traditional marks, but 
still leave marks.
Investigative Process
Investigations are broken down into several steps: crime scene investigation, laboratory examinations, 
investigative reports, and expert testimony. Some investigations may not require all steps; evidence may 
be mailed to you, testimony may not be required, and so on.
The goal of the investigation should be clearly defined from the start. Many investigations will not 
require that you exhaust all possibilities, but instead give you a clear, direct goal. For example, 
identifying if a key could have been used to open a lock, if the lock has any pick marks, or if a key 
machine was used to make a specific key. All of this depends on who the forensic locksmith is working 
for; insurance companies only need facts relating to their liability, but criminal investigations will be 
looking for as much information as possible.

Forensic Investigation page of Lockpicking Forensics.
Resources
Unfortunately, few free and readily accessible resources are available for forensic locksmithing. 
LockpickingForensics.com and LockWiki.com are they only sites that deal with the topic in-depth. There 
are at least three books that deal with the subject, but more often than not it is combined with generic 
forensic investigation or tool mark identification literature.
Currently, the best English book on the subject is Locks, Safes, and Security by Marc Weber Tobias. 
Chapters 24-27 deal extensively with forensic investigations of locks and keys. If you can afford it, it is 
highly recommended. The forensic section can be purchased individually, but I would recommend buying 
the full book instead. I would also recommend buying the multimedia edition of the book rather than the 
print version. The multimedia edition comes with a wealth of audio and video recordings that deal with 
forensic locksmithing.
If you can read German, then Manfred Göth's book Werkzeugspur ("Tool Traces") is available. I do not 
read German, but I am told this book is excellent. Manfred Göth also authored the chapter on forensics in 
Oliver Diederichsen's book Impressionstechnik ("Impressioning"). This book is available in both English 
and German.
The International Association of Investigative Locksmiths (
 IAIL
 )   provides licensing and certification for 
forensic/investigative locksmiths. More information is available on their website.
There have been many articles published in locksmith and safe technician magazines over the past few 
decades. Most, if not all, are unavailable in digital form and cannot be re-published due to copyright 
laws. A few are included in the digital version of Locks, Safes, and Security, mentioned above.
