User:  Discuss the working principle of the HTTPS protocol, and its similarities and differences with the HTTP protocol.
Assistant: Working Principle of the HTTPS Protocol The main purpose of the HTTPS protocol is to ensure the security of communication by encrypting the transmitted data. HTTPS is usually an HTTP protocol running on top of an encryption layer (TLS/SSL). Therefore, HTTPS can encrypt, authenticate, and protect the integrity of transmitted data. 1. Establish a TLS/SSL connection First, the client initiates an HTTPS request, and the requested information includes the requested URL, request method (GET, POST, etc.), request header, and so on. Then, after receiving the request, the server will send a public key certificate to the client, which contains information such as the public key of the site, the information of the certificate authority, and the validity period of the certificate. 2. Public key encryption transmission Symmetric key After receiving the certificate, the client will confirm whether the certificate is valid, that is, whether the issuing authority of the certificate is trustworthy and whether the certificate has expired. If the certificate is valid, the client will obtain the public key from the certificate, and use the public key to encrypt a random symmetric key (also called "session key"), and then send the encrypted symmetric key to the server. 3. Symmetrically encrypted transmission data After the server receives the encrypted symmetric key sent by the client, it decrypts the private key to obtain the symmetric key, and then the two parties can start to communicate using the symmetric key, and use the symmetric encryption algorithm to ensure that the data confidentiality and integrity. 4. Close the TLS/SSL connection When all data transmission is completed, both parties can close the TLS/SSL connection to end this communication. Similarities and differences between HTTPS and HTTP: 1. Both are application layer protocols based on TCP/IP; 2. Both use URLs to locate resources; 3. Both use request and response models for communication; 4. Both use a stateless protocol. Differences: 1. HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, because HTTPS encrypts and decrypts data through SSL/TLS, thereby preventing data eavesdropping and tampering; 2. HTTPS needs to use SSL/TLS certificates to verify the identity of the server and confirm whether it is Trusted server enhances the security of data communication; 3. HTTP uses port 80 by default, and HTTPS uses port 443 by default; 4. HTTP is faster because HTTPS requires encryption and decryption operations, which consume additional computing resources , resulting in a slowdown.
