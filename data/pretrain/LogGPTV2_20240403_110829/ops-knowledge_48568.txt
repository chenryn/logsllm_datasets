User: How can I stop/kill a running task on Airflow UI? I am using LocalExecutor.
Even if I use CeleryExecutor, how do can I kill/stop the running task?
Assistant: As menioned by Pablo and Jorge pausing the Dag will not stop the task from being executed if the execution already started. However there is a way to stop a running task from the UI but it's a bit hacky.
When the task is on running state you can click on CLEAR this will call job.kill() the task will be set to shut_down and moved to up_for_retry immediately hence it is stopped.
Clearly Airflow did not meant for you to clear tasks in Running state however since Airflow did not disable it either you can use it as I suggested. Airflow meant CLEAR to be used with failed, up_for_retry etc...  Maybe in the future the community will use this bug(?) and implement this as a functionality with "shut down task" button.
