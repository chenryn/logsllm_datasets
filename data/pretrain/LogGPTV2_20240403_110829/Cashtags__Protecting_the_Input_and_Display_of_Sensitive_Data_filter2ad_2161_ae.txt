address  change:  the  alias $street is  assigned  to  the 
new data, and the past street address can be assigned to

6. Related Work
Previous works include both systems that secure against 
observation-based attacks and those that provide similar
privacy protection over network channels.  
6.1 Visual authentication protection
Prior  work  on  protection  against  visual  exposure  is 
focused on securing the act of authentication. By far the 
earliest  is  the  technique  of  Xing  out  or  not  printing 
entered  passwords  on  login  screens  [15]. Most  others 
can be  generalized  as  an  augmentation  or replacement 
of password entry mechanisms.
Password  managers:    Password managers  allow  the 
user to select a predefined username and password pair 
from a list for entry into the login fields [14]. This also 
allows  a  user  to  use  different  passwords  for  different 
apps without the need to remember each individually.  
Hardware-based  authentication: 
  Hardware-based 
authentication 
techniques  utilize  specialized  USB 
dongles  [17],  audio  jacks  [18],  short-range  wireless 
communication  [19],  or  Bluetooth  connections  [20]  to 
connect  to  the  authenticating  machine.    Therefore,  a 
bystander  cannot  obtain  the  authentication  information
by observation.
Graphical  passwords: 
  Graphical  passwords  or 
Graphical  User  Authentication (GUA) [22]  replace the 
alpha-numeric password with a series of images, shapes, 
and  colors.    The  user  needs  to  click  a  sequence  of

Biometrics: 
  Biometric  authentication  mechanisms 
augment password entry (something one knows) with a 
feature unique to one’s personal biology (something one 
is).  The  most  commonly  used  of  these  biometric 
identifiers includes contours of the fingerprints [26], iris 
and retinal configuration of the eye [27], and geometries

Behavioral 
characteristics such as keystroke latency [30], gait [31], 
and voice [32] can also be used.
Gesture-based 
  Gesture-based 
authentication  techniques allow the  user  to  perform 
specific  tap  [33],  multi-finger  presses  [34],  or  swipe 
sequences on-screen [35] to represent a password. 
Cognitive  challenges  and
  Other 
techniques  have  attempted  to  make  games  of  the 
authentication  procedure  [37].  These  techniques  utilize 
challenge-response  questions  and  cognitive  tasks  to 
increase the difficulty of the login session [38].  Other 
techniques  use obfuscation  (e.g.,  the  hiding  of  cursors 
[39],  confusion  matrices  [40],  and  recognition  [41])
rather than recall-based methods, to confuse onlookers. 
Alternative sensory inputs:  Some systems utilize audio 
direction  [42]  or  tactile  and  haptic  feedback  from  the 
vibration  motors  on  devices  [43]  to  provide  the  user 
with  the  appropriate  cue  for the  necessary  response.  
The  user 
the  passphrase 
corresponding to the cue via traditional input methods.
There are also systems that extend GUAs by requiring 
sequential graphical inputs and use mechanics, such as
eye tracking, blinking and gaze-based interaction for the 
user to input the graphical sequence [44].  Systems have 
even demonstrated  the  capability  of  using brain  waves 
for  this  task;  a  user  may  only  need  to  think  a  specific 
thought  to  authenticate  with  a  system  [45].    These 
methods  are  also  useful  alternatives  for  authentication 
of people with visual or audio sensory disabilities [46]. 
6.2 Physical barriers and screen filters
Physical  barriers  can  serve  as  a  means  of  limiting  the 
amount of screen exposure to bystanders.  This can be 
as simple as office cubicles.  However, they are clearly 
not  suitable  for 
increasingly  mobile  modern 
workforce.  Other  solutions,  such  as  the  3M  Privacy 
Filter [67] approach the problem by limiting the field of 
view of the screen. This may serve to reduce exposure, 
but larger screens are still visible for a larger area and 
can be seen by unauthorized viewers directly behind the 
device.

the 
reduce  the screen  visibility  further  by  completely 
blocking  out  all  non-direct  visual  exposure.  However, 
this  also  blocks  the  user's  own  field  of  view, leaving 
them  susceptible  to  external  threats  such  as  pick 
pocketing.
6.3 Wearable devices
Wearable  headsets  such  as  Google  Glass  [57]  prevent 
screen exposure by moving the screen directly in front 
of  the  user’s  eyes.  However,  the  current  generation 
devices  have  limited  application  support.  In  addition, 
much  of  the  user  input  is  performed  by  audio  cues, 
which translates the visual sensitive data leaks to audio 
ones.
Oculus  Rift  [65]  and  Samsung  Galaxy  Wearable  [66] 
permit  similar  private  screen  viewing.    However,  they 
currently do  not  permit  general-purpose  computing.
Additionally, like physical barriers, these devices block 
the user’s field of view, increasing the vulnerability to 
external physical threats.
6.4 Digital communication channel protection
Many  protocols  and  systems  have  been  developed  to 
handle other aspects of privacy-oriented attacks through 
the  encryption  of  the  digital  communication  channel.  
Transport Layer Security and Secure Sockets Layer can 
enhance security by providing session-based encryption 
[47]. Virtual Private Networks can be used to enhance 
security by offering point-to-point encryption to provide 
secure 
insecure  network 
topologies  [48].    Proxy  servers  [49]  and  onion  routing 
protocols  such  as Tor  [50], can  add  extra  privacy  by 
providing 
of 
and 
anonymization of IP addresses.
Other solutions have been developed to enhance privacy 
of browsers.  Do-not-track  requests  can  be  included  in 
the  HTTP  headers  to  request  that  the  web  server  or 
application  disable  its  user  and  cross-site  tracking 
mechanisms [51].  Many browser extensions and plug-
ins exist to block ads [52], analytics, beacons, and other 
tracking mechanisms [53]. Other systems alert the user 
when specific sensitive elements are leaked [54].  They
prevent  the  transmission  of  sensitive  data  without 
explicit  user permission  [55],  and  the  cryptography 
secures access  to  sensitive  data  outside  of  trusted 
situations [16].
6.5 Compared to Cashtags
Despite  the  various  mechanisms mentioned,  the  visual 
channel  remains  largely open.    A  limited  number  of 
tools are available to obfuscate sensitive data other than 
during the act of authentication.  Other tools developed 
resources  access  across

purposes.  
Password-based  solutions  and  biometrics  are effective 
in handling visual leaks during the act of authentication, 
but they cannot be generalized to handle other cases. No 
existing mechanism is in place to allow arbitrary data to 
be  marked  as  sensitive.  To  our  best  knowledge, 
Cashtags is the only system that can protect general data 
from shoulder surfing.

7. Discussion and Limitations
Increased 
text 
manipulation  works  for  apps  that  use  standard  text-
rendering  methods.  Should  developers  deviate  from 
such standards, Cashtags would not capture such cases. 
Still, the additions required to incorporate these custom 
methods to work within Cashtags would be minimal if 
knowledge  of  the  custom  text  display  functions  and 
parameters were provided.
Cashtags currently is optimized for coverage rather than 
performance.    Thus,  one  future  direction  is  to  explore 
better text-processing methods and data structures. 
Common  names:    Commonly  occurring  names  can  be 
problematic. Consider a user John Smith, with Cashtag 
aliases 
and 
Smith$lname. Therefore, all on-screen instances of 
John are masked as $fname. If John opens his browser 
and Googles the name John Travolta, all returned search 
results  would 
on-screen 
representations  as  $fname Travolta.  If  an  on-looker 
was able to observe the above search queries, and was
aware of the operation of Cashtags, he or she might be 
able to derive the sensitive data from the context. This 
limitation  is  isolated  to  common  phrases;  numerical 
phrases would be less subject to this issue.
Data formatting:  For data formatting and types, many 
cases are handled through transformations of text fields,
including  the  removal  of  spaces  and  symbols,  and 
capitalization  mismatches.  However,  data  that  expands 
across TextViews is not recognized (e.g., input fields 
for  a  credit  card  split  into  parts  rather  than  combined 
into  a  single  field).  Cashtags  could  handle  this  if  each 
part  of  the  credit-card  number  were added  to  the 
repository.
Handling  business  use  cases:  This  paper  presents 
Cashtags  in  light  of  protecting personal  sensitive 
information.    However, with  more  advanced  cashtag 
mapping  rules 
implemented  via  regular 
expression templates, we can extend our framework to 
handle  business  use  cases.    For  example,  for  banking 
displayed  with 
internally 
be 
account apps, we can mask all of the dollar amounts to 
$#, with a fixed number of digits.  A user can specify 
common  preset  amounts  using  cashtags  (e.g.,  pay
$rent to $apt_acct).    For  database  apps,  we  can 
mask fields with specific template formats (e.g., phone 
numbers,  identification numbers with  certain prefixes).  
While such extension will require ways to specify app-
specific rules, our core framework remains the same.
Generalization of approach: The Cashtags system was 
prototyped on Android.  However, the general approach 
of  screen  rendering  and  user  input  interception  can 
easily be generalized. 
Human  subject  study: One  aspect  that  is  important  to 
system  usability  is  the  frequency  that  sensitive  data  is 
entered  or  displayed.  The  actual  utility  of  Cashtags  is 
directly related to how frequently personally identifiable 
information 
the  user. 
Unfortunately,  to  our  best  knowledge  statistics  on  the 
frequency  of  such  accesses  are  not  available.  A  future 
human  subjects  study  of  Cashtags  can  help  determine 
this frequency of sensitive data access, as well as further 
evaluate system effectiveness and usability.

8. Conclusion
Cashtags is a first step toward protection against visual 
leaks of on-screen data.  The system demonstrates that it 
is possible to perform most mobile computing tasks in 
public locations without exposing sensitive information. 
The  evaluation  of  the  system  shows that  this  can  be
accomplished  efficiently,  with  minimal  perceived 
overhead.  The  app  coverage  test  confirms  that  the 
system handles general-purpose tasks and maintains full 
functionality with  nearly  all  tested  common  use  cases.
These results suggest that Cashtags will likely work on 
most other mobile apps, providing unified, device-wide 
protection against shoulder surfing.
