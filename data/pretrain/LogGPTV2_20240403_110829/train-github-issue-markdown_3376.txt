In my experience, the training speed for each batch in TensorFlow is usually consistent. However, I am currently encountering an issue while training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). For the first three epochs, each batch of 128 samples took approximately one second to process. Starting from the third epoch, the processing times have become inconsistent, with some batches experiencing significant slowdowns.

During these slow periods, I can hear the fan on my GTX Titan GPU spin down, indicating that the GPU's computational resources are not being fully utilized. I have implemented timing in my code to ensure that no other factors are affecting the performance.

Here is how I am measuring the time:
```python
begin_time = time.time()
loss, ts = sess.run([cost, train_step], feed_dict={input_tensor: x_train, expected_output: y_train, keep_prob: 0.8})
end_time = time.time()
```

Below is the output with timing information, showing the inconsistency in batch processing times:

```
Epoch 3        Batch 858      Loss 172.072438250   Last Loss 206.985626221   Time 1.432 
Epoch 3        Batch 859      Loss 172.067967827   Last Loss 168.227874756   Time 1.419 
Epoch 3        Batch 860      Loss 172.057925642   Last Loss 163.421646118   Time 1.447 
...
Epoch 3        Batch 872      Loss 172.052568940   Last Loss 160.158828735   Time 2.614 
Epoch 3        Batch 873      Loss 172.032694941   Last Loss 154.682693481   Time 2.208 
...
Epoch 3        Batch 896      Loss 172.008338426   Last Loss 178.110900879   Time 0.999 
Epoch 3        Batch 897      Loss 172.015577083   Last Loss 178.508651733   Time 1.699 
...
Epoch 3        Batch 906      Loss 172.065538518   Last Loss 160.097106934   Time 4.606 
Epoch 3        Batch 907      Loss 172.040349112   Last Loss 149.193557739   Time 4.513 
...
```

For comparison, here is the typical output when the issue does not occur, showing consistent batch processing times:

```
Epoch 1        Batch 213      Loss 262.820208541   Last Loss 189.761398315   Time 0.978 
Epoch 1        Batch 214      Loss 262.570083973   Last Loss 209.043426514   Time 0.984 
Epoch 1        Batch 215      Loss 262.265294534   Last Loss 196.735565186   Time 0.985 
...
Epoch 1        Batch 229      Loss 258.643836975   Last Loss 199.667221069   Time 0.986 
Epoch 1        Batch 230      Loss 258.344224079   Last Loss 189.433258057   Time 0.979 
```

After some time, the system will eventually return to processing batches in about one second. I am using Ubuntu 16.04 with cuDNN 5 and CUDA 8. This problem is intermittent, and I have not been able to reproduce it consistently.
