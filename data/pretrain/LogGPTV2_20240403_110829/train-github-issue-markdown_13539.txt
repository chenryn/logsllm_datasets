I'm trying to setup something like this with Symfony 2.6.1:
    $builder
        ->add('field', 'choice', [
            'choices' => array_combine(range(0.1, 1.0, 0.1), range(0.1, 1.0, 0.1))
        ]);
and this is the mapping for Doctrine:
        field:
            type: decimal
            precision: 2
            scale: 1
            options:
                default: 1.0
The field never shows the value 1.0 as selected when it is (works fine for 0.1
=> 0.9). I have tried converting all float values to string using
`number_format` but doesn't work either.
I have also tried using
`http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/forms/types/choice.html#choice-
list`, but taking the example on that page I get this:
       Full
       Half
as you can see, there's no float values here (shouldn't it be 1 => Full, 0.5
=> Half?) Is this a bug with `ChoiceList` or the example is incorrect?
Thanks in advanced for any insight.
