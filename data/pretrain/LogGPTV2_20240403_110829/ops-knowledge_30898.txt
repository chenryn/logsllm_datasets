User: Using HttpUwsgiModule with NGINX to control uWSGI has become quite popular since its release.
I was wondering though, what is the advantage of it, compared to using NGINX as a reverse-proxy to uWSGI application?
What are the gains and losses in two differing use cases?
Assistant: Simply put, when you use HttpUwsgiModule NGINX speaks the uwsgi protocol and it can leave out useless informations of the http protocol leading to less overhead and thus better performance.
