...as a parameter which gets inherited globally by `get()` and other HTTP
methods.
    session = requests.Session(timeout=30)
    session.get(...)
    session.get(...)
Would be equivalent to:
    session = requests.Session()
    session.get(..., timeout=30)
    session.get(..., timeout=30)
Thoughts?
