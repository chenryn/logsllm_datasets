## Abstract
We present Akamai DNS, one of the largest authoritative DNS infrastructures in the world, which supports the Akamai content delivery network (CDN) and provides authoritative DNS hosting and DNS-based load balancing services for numerous enterprises. As the starting point for a significant fraction of the world’s Internet interactions, Akamai DNS serves millions of queries per second and must be resilient, scalable, performant, and reconfigurable to handle shifts in network conditions and attacks. We outline the design principles and architecture used to achieve these goals, relating the design choices to the system workload and quantifying their effectiveness. Additionally, we share insights from operating the production system that are valuable to the broader research community.

## 1. Introduction
Naming is a central service of the Internet, primarily addressed by the Domain Name System (DNS). Introduced in 1983 [31], DNS enables the mapping of human-readable hierarchical names to various records, most notably IP addresses. For example, we refer to websites as "example.com" instead of "12.23.34.45". Over time, DNS has evolved in complexity [37, 46, 50] and continues to be an area of innovation [13, 19, 21].

DNS consists of two types of systems: recursive resolvers and authoritative nameservers. Recursive resolvers handle end-user queries, while authoritative nameservers store domain name records and provide definitive answers. The authoritative system is organized hierarchically, with root nameservers at the top, followed by top-level domain (TLD) nameservers, and then organizational nameservers. Resolvers iteratively search the hierarchy, caching answers to improve performance and reduce traffic.

In this paper, we present Akamai DNS, one of the largest authoritative DNS infrastructures, providing insights into its architecture, algorithms, design principles, and operation. We start by describing the services it supports.

### Authoritative DNS Services
Akamai DNS supports three primary services:
1. **Authoritative DNS Hosting Service (ADHS)**: Allows enterprises to host their DNS domains on Akamai.
2. **Global Traffic Management (GTM)**: Enables DNS-based load balancing among server deployments.
3. **CDN Service**: A component of Akamai’s CDN, serving 15-20% of all web traffic [36], allowing enterprises to outsource their content and application delivery infrastructure.

These services can be used together, such as DNS hosting for domains, GTM for datacenters, and CDN for edge content delivery.

### Design Requirements
Akamai DNS is crucial for the Internet ecosystem, supporting a significant fraction of global interactions. Key requirements include:
- **24/7 Availability**: Minor disruptions can cause worldwide service interruptions.
- **Resilience**: Must withstand common failures and DDoS attacks.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Must handle millions of queries per second with low latency.
- **Rapid Reconfigurability**: Must adapt quickly to changes in configurations, server liveliness, and network conditions.

### Our Contributions
Our work provides an in-depth view of Akamai DNS, including:
1. **Query Characterization**: Analysis of how domain names are queried, showing that 3% of resolvers generate 80% of DNS queries.
2. **System Architecture**: Details on wide-area deployment, anycast, software and server architecture, and two-tier delegation.
3. **Anycast Failover Mechanism**: Measurement of failover times, demonstrating rapid recovery.
4. **Resiliency and Security**: Design elements for resilience and a taxonomy of attack scenarios and mitigations.
5. **Performance**: Use of anycast traffic engineering and two-tier delegation to reduce DNS resolution times.

### Roadmap
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
- **§2**: Characterizing query traffic.
- **§3**: Presenting the system architecture.
- **§4 & §5**: Describing architectural features and algorithms for resilience, security, and performance.
- **§6**: Related work.
- **§7**: Conclusion.

## 2. Characterizing Query Traffic
We analyze DNS queries served by Akamai DNS to understand its properties and justify our design decisions. Akamai DNS serves a broad cross-section of the Internet, making its query traffic representative of global DNS usage.

### Data Analysis
Over a typical week in December 2019, Akamai DNS served approximately 360 billion DNS queries per day from over 5.4 million source IP addresses. Query rates vary diurnally, ranging from 3.9 million to 5.6 million queries per second (qps), with weekend-weekday variations. Geolocation using EdgeScape [3] shows that 92% of queries originate from North America, Europe, and Asia.

### Query Distribution
Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of resolver IP addresses. The top 3% of resolvers account for 80% of all DNS queries, similar to observations in [17]. These resolvers are highly consistent, with 85-98% (mean 92%) of the same resolvers appearing weekly over 69 weeks and 79-98% (mean 88%) monthly. Figure 2 also shows that 1% of ASNs account for 83% of DNS queries, with the top 6 ASNs including 3 public DNS services, 2 major ISPs, and Akamai itself.

### Domain Breakdown
For ADHS, the top 1% of zones account for 88% of all DNS queries, with one zone receiving 5.5% of all queries. Many zones are infrequently accessed.

### Workload on Nameservers
Figure 3 shows the queries received by a modestly-loaded nameserver from 60,000 resolvers. The distribution is highly skewed, with most resolvers sending very few queries. The workload exhibits bursty behavior, with the highest average being 173 qps and the maximum observed at 2,352 qps. This informs the design of filters to detect and flag anomalous requests.

### Consistency of Resolvers
Figure 4 shows the percent difference in DNS queries sent by resolvers over a week. 53% of weighted resolvers differed by less than ±10%, indicating that the resolvers sending the most queries continue to do so consistently.

## 3. System Architecture
Akamai DNS consists of authoritative nameservers and supporting components for metadata processing, monitoring, and complex control logic. Figure 5 illustrates the high-level architecture.

### 3.1 Authoritative Nameservers
To provide quick responses, Akamai’s nameservers are distributed across hundreds of points of presence (PoPs) in 157 countries. We use 24 distinct IPv4-IPv6 anycast prefix pairs to distribute load and reduce round-trip-time (RTT). Each prefix pair forms an "anycast cloud," and each PoP advertises no more than two clouds.

#### PoP Architecture
Each PoP (Figure 6) includes a router and one or more purpose-built machines running specialized nameserver software. Each machine also runs a BGP-speaker to establish sessions with the PoP router and advertise the assigned anycast clouds. A local monitoring agent continuously tests the nameserver’s health and withdraws anycast advertisements if issues are detected.

When the router receives a DNS query, it forwards it to the nearest available nameserver based on the anycast routing. This ensures low latency and high availability, even in the event of PoP failures.

## 4. Resilience and Security
### 4.1 Anycast Failover Mechanism
We measure the failover time when advertising or withdrawing routes via BGP. In most scenarios, failover is rapid, taking less than 1 second in 76% of measurements.

### 4.2 Resiliency and Security Design
We describe the system design elements that provide resiliency to network, hardware, and software failures and malicious DDoS attacks. We present a taxonomy of attack scenarios and the mitigations designed to thwart them.

### 4.3 Performance
We show how Akamai DNS achieves high performance through anycast traffic engineering and two-tier delegation. We measure the performance of two-tier delegation and demonstrate that it reduces DNS resolution times for 87-98% of queries compared to a single-tier system.

## 5. Related Work
We review related work in the field of DNS and distributed systems, highlighting key contributions and differences from our approach.

## 6. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have presented Akamai DNS, one of the largest authoritative DNS infrastructures, and provided detailed insights into its architecture, design principles, and operational challenges. Our work contributes to the understanding of large-scale DNS systems and offers valuable lessons for the broader research community.
