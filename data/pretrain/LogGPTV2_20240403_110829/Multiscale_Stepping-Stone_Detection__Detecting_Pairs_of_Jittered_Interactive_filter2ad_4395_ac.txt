where supp(ψ) – the support of ψ – the part of the t-axis where ψ is nonzero; and
T V (Ψ) – the Total Variation – is informally the sum of all the ups and downs in
(cid:2)(t)|dt, while
the graph of Ψ; formally, for a smooth function Ψ(t), T V (Ψ) =
for piecewise smooth functions, the total variation includes also the sum of the
jumps across discontinuities.
Our second analytical tool has to do with properties of extreme values of
stochastic processes. Causality and Maximum Tolerable Delay imply that

hence,
and so
|N1(t) − N2(t)| ≤ N1(t) − N1(t − ∆)
|N1(t) − N2(t)| ≤ max{N1(t + ∆) − N1(t) : t, t + ∆ ∈ supp(Ψ)} .
In words, the diﬀerence between N1 and N2 is controlled by the volume in N1.
We now use results about extremes of Poisson processes. If N1 is the set of
cumulative arrivals of a Poisson counting process, then
max{N1(t + ∆) − N1(t) : t, t + ∆ ∈ [a, b]} ≤ OP (log(b − a)) · E{N1(t + ∆) − N1(t)}
For more details see [2] and [1].
Based on these two analytical tools, we can easily obtain the results in the
previous section:
– Calculation for Multiscale Block Averages. This is based on the following
ingredients. First, symbols emerge at Poisson arrival times t1, . . . , tN , with
rate λ. Second, the ‘bump’ has mean 1 and so E[α1
j,k] = λ (as one might
j,k] = Const · λ/scale, which is the usual 1/n-law for
guess). Third, V ar[α1
variances of means. Consequently, the random ﬂuctuations of the scaling
coeﬃcients obey

j,k ≈ λ ± c/

j,k − α2
To calculate the maximum ﬂuctuation of α1
j,k, we observe that
T V (ψj,k) ≤ 4/scale and sup{N1(t + ∆) − N1(t) : t ∈ [a, a + scale]} =
OP (log(scale)), giving the key conclusion |α1
j,k| ≤ O(log(scale)/scale).
– Calculation for Multiscale Block Diﬀerences. Again we assume that sym-
bols emerge at Poisson arrival times t1, . . . , tN , with rate λ. Second, the
‘wiggle’ has mean 0 and so E[α1
j,k] = 0 (again as one might guess). Third,
j,k] = Const · λ/scale, which is the usual 1/n-law for variances of
V ar[α1
means. Consequently, the random ﬂuctuations of the wavelet coeﬃcients
obey

j,k ≈ ±c/

We again note that this analysis, as it stands, applies only to Poisson streams.
Further analysis, given in the appendix, indicates that the same type of analysis
can apply to Pareto streams and many others as well.

7 Simulation
To illustrate the above results, consider a simple transcoder: local inter-keystroke
shuﬄing (LIS). This transcoder works as follows. We buﬀer symbols for M con-
secutive symbols or ∆ milliseconds, whichever comes ﬁrst. Suppose that the times
of the symbol arrivals into the incoming stream buﬀer are t1,..., tm, so that nec-
essarily m ≤ M and tm − t1 < ∆. We then compute the interarrival times of the
symbols in the buﬀer, δ1 = t2 − t1, δ2 = t3 − t2, . . . , δm−1 = tm − tm−1.
Given the number δ1, . . . , δm−1, we perform a random shuﬄing of the times,
obtaining ε1, . . . , εm−1. Then we deﬁne a second set of times by
u1 = tm, u2 = u1 + ε1, . . . ui = ui−1 + εi−1, . . . ,
and we output symbols in the second stream at times ui (we ignore here the
processing time required for calculating the ui, which is surely trivial in this
case). Figure 7 illustrates the type of transformation obtained by LIS.
Fig. 7. LIS Transform: Row of ‘x’ – arrival times in original stream; Row of ‘o’ – arrival
times in transformed stream; vertical lines demarcate zones of 8 characters; top group
of horizontal lines – lengths depict inter-keystroke times; bottom group – lengths depict
same times, but shuﬄed within one zone. Note, the bottom set of boxes should be shifted
in time over to the right by ∆; this will be ﬁxed in the ﬁnal version of the ﬁgure.
A new stream synthesized by LIS has these properties:
– Identical Distribution. Whatever the underlying distribution of
inter-
keystroke times δi associated with (ti), the new stream (ui) has inter-
keystroke times with the same distribution, because the actual
inter-
keystroke times are just the same numbers arriving in a diﬀerent order.
Multiscale Stepping-Stone Detection

– Causality. Characters arrive in Stream 2 later than Stream 1
ti ≤ ui
– Controlled delay. Characters do not arrive much later in Stream 2:
ti < ui < ti + 2∆.
Thus, there is no possibility that a statistical traﬃc anomaly detector can have
cause for ﬂagging a stream 2 produced by LIS as aberrant traﬃc. Also, by
controlling the parameter ∆, we control the maximum tolerable delay.
To study the properties of multiscale detectors in the LIS setting, we use
Monte-Carlo simulation. In our simulation experiments, we used for (ti) samples
from the empirical distribution of inter-keystroke times described in [9]. We
created a stream several minutes in length and we transcoded this stream three
times at three diﬀerent delay parameters: 100 msec, 200 msec, and 300 msec.
From the streams, we created time series. We selected 256 second stretches of
each stream, divided the time axis into 1/64th second intervals, and we counted
the number of character arrivals (always 0 or 1, of course) within each interval.
This gave us equally spaced series of 16384= 215 0’s and 1’s. We then used the
freely available wavelet transform routines in WaveLab [10] to perform a wavelet
analysis using the Haar wavelets.
The table below reports correlations between wavelet coeﬃcients of the orig-
inal stream and the three transformed streams. It contains the empirical correla-
tions between the wavelet coeﬃcients at various scales, deﬁning the correlation
coeﬃcient at scale j by

These results are typical and repeatable. Correlations, of course, cannot ex-
ceed 1.0. So these correlations, which approach 1 at suﬃciently long scales, are
rather large. Evidently, given about 1 minute’s worth of data on two jittered
streams, we can obtain a substantial signal by correlation of wavelet coeﬃcients.
Note particularly the very high correlations when jittering is less than .1 sec.
8 Detecting Evasions in the Presence of Chaﬀ
In the analysis since Section 4, we have assumed that any stream transformation
being used to disguise correlations was conservative – that is, it exactly preserves
the number and content of keystrokes, but perhaps alters their timing.
32
D. Donoho et al.
We now discuss the more general situation when this is not the case. A
reasonable way to begin modeling the general situation is to say that we have
two cumulative character counting functions N1 and N2, and that now
N2(t) = N
(cid:2)
1(t) + M(t),
(cid:2)
where N
1(t) is the cumulative counting function of the input character arrival
times, perhaps after a conservative stream transformation, and M is the cumu-
lative counting function of chaﬀ arrival times. In short, as we watch characters
coming in, some are from the input stream – only jittered – and others are chaﬀ.
Suppose that we once again compute the statistic Corr(j) at each scale.
What happens? The results of course change. Suppose for simplicity that the
chaﬀ arrives according to the universal keyclick interarrival process, and that
the chaﬀ arrival process is stochastically independent of the N1 process. Then
one can show that instead of
we actually have
Corr(j) → 1,
j → ∞,
Corr(j) → ρ,
j → ∞,
where 0 < ρ < 1. Here ρ may be interpreted as a ‘signal/(signal+noise)’ ratio,
meaning that the limiting value ρ can be very small if the relative amount of
chaﬀ is very large, whereas it will be close to 1 if the fraction of chaﬀ is negligible.
Nevertheless, no matter how small ρ might be, any nonzero value for ρ will
be detectable, at least for suﬃciently long-lived connections. Indeed, for large
enough n, it will be clear that the empirical ﬂuctuations in correlations due
to statistical sampling eﬀects are simply too small to cause observed values of
Corr(j) which are substantially nonzero. Given more space, we would provide
a detailed analysis of this eﬀect, showing that the mathematics predicts a sub-
stantial correlation between wavelet coeﬃcients of N1 and of N2. The analysis
is entirely parallel to the analysis given in earlier sections.
In short, although certainly the presence of chaﬀ causes a more complex
problem, the statistical tools and diagnostic approaches suggested for the no-
chaﬀ case seem to be equally applicable to the chaﬀ case.
9 Discussion
This paper has considered basic ‘proof of concept’ issues. In particular, we have
not discussed here the systems-level issues of working in a setting where there
may be many hundreds of active Telnet or SSH connections into and out of a
large site (say, a university or corporate network), and it is required to monitor
and detect stepping stones in real time. A typical issue would be to consider as
a monitoring interval a speciﬁc length of time (e.g. 4 minutes), and calculate
the proper height of the threshold for the ‘stepping stone alarm’ in order that
Multiscale Stepping-Stone Detection
33
in looking at thousands of pairs of connections which are truly uncorrelated,
we control the false alarm rate to a tolerable number of false alarms per day.
Obviously, it would be very important to study such issues carefully.
We have discussed here the fact that real interactive sessions seem to have
inter-keystroke times whose distribution is Pareto in the upper tail. In the anal-
ysis section of this paper we have considered Poisson streams, which are easy
to analyze. In the appendix, we show that the analysis can generalize to other
streams. This points out that an accurate theoretical model for inter-keystroke
timing is in order, so that we can focus attention and develop mathematical
analysis associated with that model. Such a correct model would be extremely
useful in practical terms, for example in systems-level work where it could used
for false alarm calibration purposes.
Two particular components of the inter-keystroke timing model which should
be considered more closely: (a) the correlation structure of adjacent/nearby inter-
keystroke times; and (b) the chance of seeing many characters in a very short
interval. The signiﬁcance of these can be gleaned from the discussion in the
appendix. Knowing more about either or both components would help mathe-
matical analysis and simulation accuracy.
There are also other sources of information that we haven’t discussed – the
key one being the two-way nature of interactive sessions. There is far more
information than just the keystrokes on the forward path through the stepping
stones, there are also the echoes and command output on the reverse path, and
it should be possible to use information about these to substantially improve
detection.

Appendix
Explanation of the Bumps/Wiggles Dichotomy
Analysis by ”multiscale bumps” provides, as explained above, a collection of
multiscale block averages. In other words, the coeﬃcients measure the rate of
typing of the given stream.
Analysis by ”multiscale wiggles” provides, as explained above, a collection of
multiscale diﬀerences of block averages. In other words, the coeﬃcients measure
the changes in the rate of typing of the given stream.
It is our opinion that measuring changes in rate, and noticing the times those
occur, provides more reliable evidence for the identity of two streams; so we
believe that analysis by multiscale wiggles (i.e. what is ordinarily called simply
wavelet analysis) will give more reliable information indicating the identity of
the two streams.
(There is one other advantage of wavelet analysis: the possibility of develop-
ing detectors for non-keystroke conserving schemes which work by the multiplex-
ing of constant-rate chaﬀ together with the original stream. Suppose that two
streams diﬀer in that stream 2 contains stream 1 along with characters from an
independent chaﬀ source of constant rate (e.g. Poisson with Rate 20 char/sec). It
can be shown, by elaborating the point of view here, that the wavelet coeﬃcients
at suﬃciently long scales will have a dependable correlation < 1, but which is
stable and nonzero, and determined by a kind of statistical signal/chaﬀ ratio.
So we might notice that two streams which should be completely uncorrelated
actually exhibit correlations which are deﬁnitely nonzero).
The diﬀerent normalization of the wavelet coeﬃcients in the two cases has
to do with the appropriate means of interpretation of each type of coeﬃcient.
Averages are directly interpretable in the units of the phenomenon being mea-
sured, no matter what the scale of the average. Diﬀerences are not so universally
interpretable; the convention p = 1/2 ensures that they are normalized accord-
ing to the square-root of interval size rather than interval size. The rationale is
that for typical point processes, the coeﬃcients at diﬀerent scales will then be
of comparable size.

Generalization to Non-poisson Streams
The reader will note that only in two places in the argument of Section 6 did we
use the Poisson process assumption
The ﬁrst was
max{N1(t + ∆) − N1(t) : t, t + ∆ ∈ [a, b]} ≤ OP (log(b − a)) · E{N1(t + ∆) − N1(t)}.
This condition says that within any maximum tolerable delay interval, we are
very unlikely to see character counts dramatically greater than the average char-
acter counts. This inequality is extremely easy to satisfy and many point pro-
cesses will obey it. It is also the case that real data will obey it. We might
for example stipulate that no actual human person is ever going to exceed an
absolute maximum of K characters in ∆ no matter how long we wait. If we
do, the above inequality will automatically be true, because log(b − a) grows
unboundedly with observation period, while K is an absolute constant.
Incidentally, the Pareto nature of the upper half of the inter-keystroke timing
distribution described in [9] is entirely compatible with this inequality. Indeed,
the Pareto upper tail is responsible for occasional long dead spots in a stream,
where no characters emerge. It is the lower tail – near zero inter-keystroke spacing
– that determines whether the needed condition holds. The Poisson assumption
−t/λ/λ which is of course
makes the inter-keystroke distribution have a density e
bounded near t = 0; this boundedness implies that there will not typically be
large numbers of events in a short time. It seems safe to say that this aspect of
the Poisson distribution accurately models real streams of keystrokes.
The second fact used was (in, say, the multiscale block averages case)
V ar[N1(0, T ]] (cid:11) Const · T
which says that the ﬂuctuation in the number of events per unit time within an
interval grows like the square root of the interval size. This will be true for many
stationary point processes.
Now, the Pareto nature of the upper half of the inter-keystroke timing dis-
tribution described in [9], and the possibility of a non-i.i.d. behavior of inter-
keystroke times can modify this inequality, even making the variability grow like
a power T β with β (cid:12)= 1. A more detailed analysis shows that even though the
variance scaling exponents could be diﬀerent, the fundamental behavior of the
corresponding terms in the analysis would be the same.
Since our simulations indicate that the multiscale diagnostics work very well
in the Pareto case, we omit further discussion of the mathematical details of the
extension.
