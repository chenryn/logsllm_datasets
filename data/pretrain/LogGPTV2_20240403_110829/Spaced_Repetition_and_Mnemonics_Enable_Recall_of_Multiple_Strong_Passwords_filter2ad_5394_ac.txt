present these metrics we must introduce some notation.
Notation: We use NumRemembered (C, i) to denote the
number of participants from study condition C who remem-
bered their secret action-object pair(s) during rehearsal i with
< 3 incorrect guesses per action-object pair, and we use
NumSurvived (C, i) to denote the number of participants
who also remembered their action-object pair(s) during every

prior rehearsal. We use NumReturned (C, i) to denote the
total number of participants who returned for rehearsal i and
we use NumSuccessfulReturned (C, i) to denote the total
number of participants who survived through rehearsal i − 1
and returned for rehearsal i. Finally, we use Time (C, i)
to denote the time of rehearsal i, as measured from the
initial memorization phase. Because the study condition C is
often clear from the context we will typically omit it in our
presentation.
NumSurvived(i)
Observe that
NumSuccessfulReturned(i) denotes the con-
ditional probability that a participant remembers his PAO
stories during rehearsal i given that s/he has survived through
rehearsal i − 1 and returned for rehearsal i. Figures 5a and
5b plot the conditional probability of survival for participants
in different study conditions. Table III shows how many
participants who had never failed before returned in each
rehearsal round as well as their conditional probability of
success with 95% conﬁdence intervals.
We compare three different metrics to estimate the sur-
vival rate of participants in our study under ideal circum-
stances (e.g., if all of our participants were always able to
return to rehearse in a timely manner). Our ﬁrst estimate is
EstimatedSurvival (i) =
