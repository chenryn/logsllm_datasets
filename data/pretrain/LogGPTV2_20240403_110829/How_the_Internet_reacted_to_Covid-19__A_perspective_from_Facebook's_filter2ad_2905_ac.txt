ing links, overutilization of CDN servers and congestion of ISPs
access networks, particularly mobile carriers in emerging markets.
Nevertheless, measures taken by operators (such as capacity ad-
ditions, rate limiting, or capping video bitrates) and the eventual
stabilization of network traffic did allow networks to recover to
their pre-Covid-19 performance levels relatively quickly.

A COVID-19 LOCKDOWN DATES
For each region we want to capture the dates of lockdown measures
affecting the most people. Hence we select per region the top three
countries by population. The only exception is Asia where we did
not consider China due to limited user traffic from this country.
Note that this covers countries coping relatively well with respect
to case- and death numbers (e.g., Australia, Germany, Ethiopia) as
well as those that coped less well (e.g., Brazil, United Kingdom,
USA). When no lockdown date was listed on the overview page, we
extracted the lockdown dates from the per country pages. When
multiple regions in a country went into lockdown, we chose the
earliest date of any region (e.g., the lockdown date of California for
the USA). When a country did not go into lockdown officially, we
use the date of when social distancing measures were introduced
first as the lockdown date. Countries marked with an * are the ones
for which we also show dates on the global figures.
