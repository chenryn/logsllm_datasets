.sh versions
.br epoll_ctl ()
was added to the kernel in version 2.6.
.\" to be precise: kernel 2.5.44.
.\" the interface should be finalized by linux kernel 2.5.66.
library support is provided in glibc starting with version 2.3.2.
.sh conforming to
.br epoll_ctl ()
is linux-specific.
.sh notes
the
.b epoll
interface supports all file descriptors that support
.br poll (2).
.sh bugs
in kernel versions before 2.6.9, the
.b epoll_ctl_del
operation required a non-null pointer in
.ir event ,
even though this argument is ignored.
since linux 2.6.9,
.i event
can be specified as null
when using
.br epoll_ctl_del .
applications that need to be portable to kernels before 2.6.9
should specify a non-null pointer in
.ir event .
.pp
if
.b epollwakeup
is specified in
.ir flags ,
but the caller does not have the
.br cap_block_suspend
capability, then the
.b epollwakeup
flag is
.ir "silently ignored" .
this unfortunate behavior is necessary because no validity
checks were performed on the
.ir flags
argument in the original implementation, and the addition of the
.b epollwakeup
with a check that caused the call to fail if the caller did not have the
.b cap_block_suspend
capability caused a breakage in at least one existing user-space
application that happened to randomly (and uselessly) specify this bit.
.\" commit a8159414d7e3af7233e7a5a82d1c5d85379bd75c (behavior change)
.\" https://lwn.net/articles/520198/
a robust application should therefore double check that it has the
.b cap_block_suspend
capability if attempting to use the
.b epollwakeup
flag.

atexit \- register a function to be called at normal process termination
.sh synopsis
.nf
.b #include 
.pp
.bi "int atexit(void (*" function )(void));
.fi
.sh description
the
.br atexit ()
function registers the given
.i function
to be
called at normal process termination, either via
.br exit (3)
or via return from the program's
.ir main ().
functions so registered are called in
the reverse order of their registration; no arguments are passed.
.pp
the same function may be registered multiple times:
it is called once for each registration.
.pp
posix.1 requires that an implementation allow at least
.\" posix.1-2001, posix.1-2008
.b atexit_max
(32) such functions to be registered.
the actual limit supported by an implementation can be obtained using
.br sysconf (3).
.pp
when a child process is created via
.br fork (2),
it inherits copies of its parent's registrations.
upon a successful call to one of the
.br exec (3)
functions,
all registrations are removed.
.sh return value
the
.br atexit ()
function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise
it returns a nonzero value.

.sh conforming to
posix.1-2001, posix.1-2008, c89, c99, svr4, 4.3bsd.
.sh notes
functions registered using
.br atexit ()
(and
.br on_exit (3))
are not called if a process terminates abnormally because
of the delivery of a signal.
.pp
if one of the registered functions calls
.br _exit (2),
then any remaining functions are not invoked,
and the other process termination steps performed by
.br exit (3)
are not performed.
.pp
posix.1 says that the result of calling
.\" posix.1-2001, posix.1-2008
.br exit (3)
more than once (i.e., calling
.br exit (3)
within a function registered using
.br atexit ())
is undefined.
on some systems (but not linux), this can result in an infinite recursion;
.\" this can happen on openbsd 4.2 for example, and is documented
.\" as occurring on freebsd as well.
.\" glibc does "the right thing" -- invocation of the remaining
.\" exit handlers carries on as normal.
portable programs should not invoke
.br exit (3)
inside a function registered using
.br atexit ().
.pp
the
.br atexit ()
and
.br on_exit (3)
functions register functions on the same list:
at normal process termination,
the registered functions are invoked in reverse order
of their registration by these two functions.
.pp
according to posix.1, the result is undefined if
.br longjmp (3)
is used to terminate execution of one of the functions registered using
.br atexit ().
.\" in glibc, things seem to be handled okay
.ss linux notes
since glibc 2.2.3,
.br atexit ()
(and
.br on_exit (3))
can be used within a shared library to establish functions
that are called when the shared library is unloaded.

    if (i != 0) {
