### Error Codes and Conditions for `epoll_ctl`

- **`ELOOP`**:
  - The file descriptor (`fd`) refers to an `epoll` instance. This `epoll_ctl_add` operation would result in a circular loop of `epoll` instances monitoring one another, or a nesting depth of `epoll` instances greater than 5.

- **`ENOENT`**:
  - The operation (`op`) was `epoll_ctl_mod` or `epoll_ctl_del`, and the file descriptor (`fd`) is not registered with this `epoll` instance.

- **`ENOMEM`**:
  - There was insufficient memory to handle the requested control operation.

- **`ENOSPC`**:
  - The limit imposed by `/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches` was encountered while trying to register a new file descriptor on an `epoll` instance. For further details, see the `epoll(7)` man page.

- **`EPERM`**:
  - The target file descriptor (`fd`) does not support `epoll`. This error can occur if `fd` refers to, for example, a regular file or a directory.

### Versions

- The `epoll_ctl()` function was added to the Linux kernel in version 2.6 (specifically, kernel 2.5.44). The interface should be finalized by Linux kernel 2.5.66.
- Library support is provided in glibc starting with version 2.3.2.

### Conformance

- The `epoll_ctl()` function is specific to Linux.

### Notes

- The `epoll` interface supports all file descriptors that support `poll(2)`.

### Bugs

- In kernel versions before 2.6.9, the `epoll_ctl_del` operation required a non-null pointer in `event`, even though this argument is ignored. Since Linux 2.6.9, `event` can be specified as `NULL` when using `epoll_ctl_del`.
- Applications that need to be portable to kernels before 2.6.9 should specify a non-null pointer in `event`.

- If the `EPOLLWAKEUP` flag is specified in `flags`, but the caller does not have the `CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND` capability, the `EPOLLWAKEUP` flag is silently ignored. This behavior is necessary because no validity checks were performed on the `flags` argument in the original implementation. Adding a check that caused the call to fail if the caller did not have the `CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND` capability broke at least one existing user-space application that happened to randomly (and uselessly) specify this bit.
- A robust application should double-check that it has the `CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND` capability if attempting to use the `EPOLLWAKEUP` flag.
