##### Detailed description
Why C programming language sucks is that char is only required to contain
ASCII, not UTF-8.
In Windows, _FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);_ only
accepts Windows-1252, which has only 256 characters, while Unicode has
1112064. To use Unicode, The wide-char version _FILE * _wfopen(const wchar_t
*filename, const wchar_t *mode);_ is required.
I suggest to add two alternative functions _imread_w_ and _imwrite_w_ , which
accept wchar_t, in only Windows builds.
