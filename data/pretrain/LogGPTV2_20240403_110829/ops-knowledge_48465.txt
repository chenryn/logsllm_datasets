User: I installed Python 3.2.3 in Debian /usr/local/bin/python3 and I installed Django 1.4 in the same directory. But when I try to import django from python 3 shell interpreter I get syntax error! What am I doing wrong?
Assistant: Django does not support Python 3.  You will need to install a version of Python 2.x.
