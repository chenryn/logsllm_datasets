User: How to use Git for code version control? What important concepts are involved?
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system that can be used to manage the version control of code and text files. The following are the basic steps and important concepts of using Git for code version control: 1. To install Git, you first need to install the Git client locally, you can Download the installation package at https://git-scm.com/downloads for installation. 2. Create a Git warehouse To use Git for version control, you first need to create a Git warehouse locally or remotely. You can use the git init command to create a new Git warehouse locally, or use the git clone command to clone a warehouse from a remote warehouse to the local . 3. Add files to the Git warehouse Add the files that need version control to the Git warehouse, use the git add command to add the files to the temporary storage area, and then use the git commit command to submit the added files to the warehouse. A version number will be generated automatically. 4. Version control Use the git status command to check the status of the local code warehouse, use the git diff command to check the modified content, and use the git log command to check the submission history and other information. 5. Branch management Using Git for branch management can facilitate parallel code development. Use the git branch command to view the branch status, use the git checkout command to switch branches, and use the git merge command to merge branches. Important concepts: 1. Git warehouse Git warehouse is the repository of Git management code, which contains all version history records, and can be a local warehouse or a remote warehouse. 2. Submit Submit refers to saving the added files to the warehouse, and the version number generated by each submission can view all modified content. 3. Branches Branches refer to the code blocks divided by the code in different development stages, which can be independently developed on the branches for parallel development, and finally the codes of different branches are merged into the main branch. 4. Merge Merging refers to merging the code of different branches into the main branch, and finally forms a complete code base. Code conflicts need to be resolved during the merge process. 5. Version number The version number is a unique identifier generated by Git for each submission. You can view the content of each submission and view the submission history through the version number.
