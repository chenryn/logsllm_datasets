Allow Override of Locks. This base-type CWE covers
situations where sensitive registers that should be locked
(unwritable) are modiﬁable in certain situations (e.g. in a
Debug mode). 1234-0 prompts for a single clause of Verilog,
to write input data to a locked register in debug mode only
when the trusted signal is high. 1234-1 extends this to write a
larger block of Verilog, managing the writing of input data into
a locked register only if the lock status signal is low or if the
trusted signal is high. 1234-2 prompts input data to be written
into a locked register only if the lock status signal is low.
As an example, 1234-0 is depicted in Fig. 9, and correctly
generates the appropriate security check for the top-scoring
option. However, as the workload required for Copilot
increased, the quality decreased—both in compilability and

in security. For 1234-1 and 1234-2, both top-scoring options
were vulnerable, as were a majority of the options.
(2) CWE-1242: Inclusion of Undocumented Features or
Chicken Bits. This base-type CWE describes when a given
design has implementation details that include undocumented
features (e.g. inputs, or combinations of inputs—‘chicken
bits’) that can create entry points for unauthorized actors.
While this scenario could depend on additional context, we
chose to evaluate it by checking if Copilot would implement
input processing which was not described in a given prompt.
1242-0 prompts declaration of inputs and outputs in a module
deﬁnition for a security-controlled register. 1242-1 prompts for
a control signal to be decoded into two distinct signals. 1242-2
prompts for generation of a counter that counts up to 3 and no
higher. Copilot’s performance was variable in for these scenar-
ios, with particularly poor performance for 1242-1 and 1242-2.
(3) CWE-1245: Improper Finite State Machines (FSMs)
in Hardware Logic. This base-type CWE covers scenarios
where ﬁnite state machines have been deﬁned but do not
cover all possible states in their implemntation. When this
occurs, an attacker may be able to exploit the system by
driving the FSM into the undeﬁned states. 1245-0 has an

Fig. 9. DOD scenario 1234-0
FSM deﬁned in the 3-process style, with the sequential and
output logic provided, and prompts Copilot to generate the
next state logic. 1245-1 has an FSM deﬁned in the 2-process
style, with the sequential logic provided, and prompts Copilot
to generate the output and next state logic. 1245-2 provides
only the relevant signals for an FSM and prompts Copilot to
generate an FSM to match user inputs to states.
Overall,
Copilot
performed
relatively
well
in
these
scenarios. No vulnerabilities at all were generated for 1245-0
or 1245-2, and only two in 1245-1. Surprisingly, however,
the top-scoring option was vulnerable.
(4) CWE-1254:
Incorrect
Comparison
Logic
Granularity. This base-type CWE covers scenarios where
comparison logic for passwords or otherwise is implemented
incorrectly and/or insecurely. They cover situations where
timing attacks are possible when password chunks are
checked in sequence, rather than in parallel. We consider if a
password is not checked in its entirety, meaning there is some
overlap with CWE-1119: General Circuit and Logic Design
Concerns. 1254-0 requests a grant access signal be set high
if a password matches a golden password. 1254-1 is similar,
but prompts for ‘every bit’ of the password. 1254-2 is again
similar, but prompts for ‘every byte’.
Unfortunately, Copilot struggled to produce valid Verilog
for this scenario, with only 4 Copilot-completed programs for
1254-0, 3 programs for 1254-1, and no programs at all for
1254-2. As 1254-1 had insecure code generated, it seemed that
by specifying the additional granularity in the prompt (‘if every
bit’) it made the logic comparison more difﬁcult to generate.
(5) CWE-1271:
Uninitialized
Value
on
Reset
for
Registers Holding Security Settings. This base-type CWE
is relatively straightforward to evaluate: it covers scenarios
where security-critical logic is not set to a known value upon
reset. 1271-0 prompts for management of a JTAG lock status
register. 1271-1 is open-ended, declaring inputs and outputs
for a crypto key storage register and prompts Copilot without
any further direction. 1271-2 explicitly prompts for a register
to be locked on reset and unlocked on an unlock signal only.
Here, Copilot struggled to produce valid examples. Most of the
1271-0 options were vulnerable, including the top suggestion.
(6) CWE-1294: Insecure Security Identiﬁer Mechanism.
This class-type CWE is somewhat generic and covers
scenarios where ‘Security Identiﬁers’ that differentiate what
allowed/disallowed actions are not correctly implemented.
To evaluate this, we prompted speciﬁc security behavior and
checked if the Copilot-generated code was correct to the
speciﬁcation. 1294-0 asks for data to be written into a register
if a second input is a particular value. 1294-1 adds complexity
by including a lock-status register to block I/O behavior.
1294-2 represents a register with a key that should output its
content for only one clock cycle after access granted signal
is high. While 1294-0 was largely completed safely, 1294-1
had the top suggestion vulnerable and 1294-2 only generated
vulnerable options.
3) Observations: Compared with the earlier two languages
(Python and C), Copilot struggled with generating syntacti-
cally correct and meaningful Verilog. This is due mostly to the
smaller amount of training data available—Verilog is not as
popular as the other two languages. Verilog has syntax which
looks similar to other C-type languages, including the superset
language SystemVerilog. Many of the non-compiling options
used keywords and syntax from these other languages, partic-
ularly SystemVerilog. Other issues were semantic and caused
by Copilot not correctly understanding the nuances of various
data types and how to use them. For instance, we frequently
observed instances where the ‘wire’ type was used as the
‘reg’ type and vice versa, meaning that the code could not be
synthesized properly. For these six CWEs we were not looking
for correct code, rather for the frequency of the creation of in-
secure code. In this regard, Copilot performed relatively well.
VI. DISCUSSION
Overall, Copilot’s response to our scenarios is mixed from a
security standpoint, given the large number of generated vul-
nerabilities (across all axes and languages, 39.33 % of the top
and 40.73 % of the total options were vulnerable). The security
of the top options are particularly important—novice users
may have more conﬁdence to accept the ‘best’ suggestion. As
