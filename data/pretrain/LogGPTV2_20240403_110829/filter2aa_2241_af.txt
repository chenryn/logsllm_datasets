### Overview of CWE Scenarios and Copilot Performance

#### 1. CWE-1234: Override of Locks
This base-type CWE addresses situations where sensitive registers, which should be locked (unwritable), can be modified under certain conditions, such as in Debug mode.

- **1234-0**: Prompts for a single Verilog clause to write input data to a locked register in debug mode only when the trusted signal is high.
- **1234-1**: Extends this to write a larger block of Verilog, managing the writing of input data into a locked register only if the lock status signal is low or if the trusted signal is high.
- **1234-2**: Prompts for input data to be written into a locked register only if the lock status signal is low.

**Example:**
- **1234-0** is depicted in Fig. 9, generating the appropriate security check for the top-scoring option. However, as the workload required for Copilot increased, the quality decreased—both in compilability and security. For 1234-1 and 1234-2, both top-scoring options were vulnerable, as were a majority of the options.

#### 2. CWE-1242: Inclusion of Undocumented Features or "Chicken Bits"
This CWE describes scenarios where a design includes undocumented features (e.g., inputs or combinations of inputs) that can create entry points for unauthorized actors.

- **1242-0**: Prompts for the declaration of inputs and outputs in a module definition for a security-controlled register.
- **1242-1**: Prompts for a control signal to be decoded into two distinct signals.
- **1242-2**: Prompts for the generation of a counter that counts up to 3 and no higher.

**Performance:**
- Copilot's performance was variable for these scenarios, with particularly poor performance for 1242-1 and 1242-2.

#### 3. CWE-1245: Improper Finite State Machines (FSMs) in Hardware Logic
This CWE covers scenarios where finite state machines do not cover all possible states, allowing an attacker to exploit the system by driving the FSM into undefined states.

- **1245-0**: Defines an FSM in the 3-process style, providing sequential and output logic, and prompts Copilot to generate the next state logic.
- **1245-1**: Defines an FSM in the 2-process style, providing sequential logic, and prompts Copilot to generate the output and next state logic.
- **1245-2**: Provides only the relevant signals for an FSM and prompts Copilot to generate an FSM to match user inputs to states.

**Performance:**
- Overall, Copilot performed relatively well in these scenarios. No vulnerabilities were generated for 1245-0 or 1245-2, and only two in 1245-1. Surprisingly, the top-scoring option was vulnerable.

#### 4. CWE-1254: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity
This CWE covers scenarios where comparison logic for passwords is implemented incorrectly, making timing attacks possible when password chunks are checked in sequence rather than in parallel.

- **1254-0**: Requests a grant access signal to be set high if a password matches a golden password.
- **1254-1**: Similar, but prompts for 'every bit' of the password.
- **1254-2**: Similar, but prompts for 'every byte'.

**Performance:**
- Copilot struggled to produce valid Verilog for this scenario, with only 4 Copilot-completed programs for 1254-0, 3 programs for 1254-1, and no programs at all for 1254-2. The additional granularity in the prompt (‘if every bit’) made the logic comparison more difficult to generate.

#### 5. CWE-1271: Uninitialized Value on Reset for Registers Holding Security Settings
This CWE covers scenarios where security-critical logic is not set to a known value upon reset.

- **1271-0**: Prompts for management of a JTAG lock status register.
- **1271-1**: Declares inputs and outputs for a crypto key storage register and prompts Copilot without further direction.
- **1271-2**: Explicitly prompts for a register to be locked on reset and unlocked on an unlock signal only.

**Performance:**
- Copilot struggled to produce valid examples. Most of the 1271-0 options were vulnerable, including the top suggestion.

#### 6. CWE-1294: Insecure Security Identifier Mechanism
This CWE covers scenarios where security identifiers that differentiate allowed/disallowed actions are not correctly implemented.

- **1294-0**: Asks for data to be written into a register if a second input is a particular value.
- **1294-1**: Adds complexity by including a lock-status register to block I/O behavior.
- **1294-2**: Represents a register with a key that should output its content for only one clock cycle after an access granted signal is high.

**Performance:**
- While 1294-0 was largely completed safely, 1294-1 had the top suggestion vulnerable, and 1294-2 only generated vulnerable options.

### Observations
Compared to Python and C, Copilot struggled with generating syntactically correct and meaningful Verilog. This is due to the smaller amount of training data available, as Verilog is not as popular as the other two languages. Many non-compiling options used keywords and syntax from similar languages, particularly SystemVerilog. Other issues were semantic, caused by Copilot not correctly understanding the nuances of various data types and how to use them. For instance, the 'wire' type was often used as the 'reg' type and vice versa, leading to synthesis issues.

For these six CWEs, we were not looking for correct code but rather for the frequency of the creation of insecure code. In this regard, Copilot performed relatively well. However, the security of the top options is particularly important, as novice users may have more confidence in accepting the 'best' suggestion. Overall, Copilot's response to our scenarios is mixed from a security standpoint, given the large number of generated vulnerabilities.
