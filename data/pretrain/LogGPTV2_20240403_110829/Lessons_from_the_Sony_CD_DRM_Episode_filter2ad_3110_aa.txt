Abstract
In the fall of 2005, problems discovered in two Sony-
BMG compact disc copy protection systems, XCP and
MediaMax, triggered a public uproar that ultimately led
to class-action litigation and the recall of millions of
discs. We present an in-depth analysis of these technolo-
gies, including their design, implementation, and deploy-
ment. The systems are surprisingly complex and suffer
from a diverse array of ﬂaws that weaken their content
protection and expose users to serious security and pri-
vacy risks. Their complexity, and their failure, makes
them an interesting case study of digital rights manage-
ment that carries valuable lessons for content companies,
DRM vendors, policymakers, end users, and the security
community.

Introduction
implemen-
This paper is a case study of the design,
tation, and deployment of anti-copying technologies.
We present a detailed technical analysis of the secu-
rity and privacy implications of two systems, XCP and
MediaMax, which were developed by separate compa-
nies (First4Internet and SunnComm, respectively) and
shipped on millions of music compact discs by Sony-
BMG, the world’s second largest record company. We
consider the design choices the companies faced, exam-
ine the choices they made, and weigh the consequences
of those choices. The lessons that emerge are valuable
not only for compact disc copy protection, but for copy
protection systems in general.
The security and privacy implications of Sony-BMG’s
CD digital rights management (DRM) technologies ﬁrst
reached the public eye on October 31, 2005, in a blog
post by Mark Russinovich [21]. While testing a rootkit
detector he had co-written, Russinovich was surprised to
ﬁnd an apparent rootkit (software designed to hide an in-
truder’s presence [13]) on one of his systems.
Investi-
gating, he found that the rootkit was part of a CD DRM
system called XCP that had been installed when he in-
serted a Sony-BMG music CD into his computer’s CD
drive.
News of Russinovich’s discovery circulated rapidly on
the Internet, and further revelations soon followed, from
us,1 from Russinovich, and from others. It was discov-
ered that the XCP rootkit makes users’ systems more
vulnerable to attacks, that both CD DRM schemes install
risky software components without obtaining informed
consent from users, that both systems covertly transmit
usage information back to the vendor or the music label,
and that none of the protected discs include tools for unin-
stalling the software. (For these reasons, both XCP and
MediaMax seem to meet the consensus deﬁnition of spy-
ware.) These and other ﬁndings outraged many users.
As the story was picked up by the popular press and
public pressure built, Sony-BMG agreed to recall XCP
discs from stores and to issue uninstallers for both XCP
and MediaMax, but we discovered that both uninstallers
created serious security holes on users’ systems. Class
action lawsuits were ﬁled soon after, and government in-
vestigations were launched, as Sony-BMG worked to re-
pair relations with its customers.
While Sony-BMG and its DRM vendors were at the
center of this incident, its implications go beyond Sony-
BMG and beyond compact discs. Viewed in context, it
is a case study in the deployment of DRM into a mature
market for recorded media. Many of the lessons of CD
DRM apply to other DRM markets as well.
Several themes emerge from this case study: similar-
ities between DRM and malicious software such as spy-
ware, the temptation of DRM vendors to adopt malware
tactics, the tendency of DRM to erode privacy, the strate-
gic use of access control to control markets, the failure
of ad hoc designs, and the force of differing incentives in
shaping behavior and causing conﬂict.

follows. Section 2 discusses the business incentives of

record labels and DRM vendors, which drive their tech-
nology decisions. Section 3 gives a high-level techni-
cal summary of the systems’ design. Sections 4–9 each
cover one aspect of the design in more detail, discussing
the design choices made in XCP and MediaMax and con-
sidering alternative designs. We discuss weaknesses in
the copy protection schemes themselves, as well as vul-
nerabilities they introduce in users’ systems. We cover
installation issues in Section 4, recognition of protected
discs in Section 5, player software in Section 6, deacti-
vation attacks in Section 7, uninstallation issues in Sec-
tion 8, and compatibility and upgrading issues in Sec-
tion 9. Section 10 explores the outrage users expressed
in response to the DRM problems. Section 11 concludes
and draws lessons for other systems.
2 Goals and Incentives
The goals of a CD DRM system are purely economic:
the system is designed to protect and enable the business
models of the record label and the DRM vendor. Accord-
ingly, any discussion of goals and incentives must begin
and end by talking about business models. The record la-
bel and the DRM vendor are separate actors whose inter-
ests are not always aligned. Incentive gaps between the
label and the DRM vendor can be important in explain-
ing the design and deployment of CD DRM systems.
2.1 Record Label Goals
We ﬁrst examine the record label’s goals. Though the
label would like to keep the music from the CD from
being made available on peer-to-peer (P2P) ﬁle sharing
networks, this goal is not feasible [4]. If even one user
can rip an unprotected copy of the music and put it on a
P2P network, it will be available to the whole world. In
practice, every commercially valuable song appears on
P2P networks immediately upon release, if not sooner.
No CD DRM system can hope to stop this. Real systems
do not appear designed to stop P2P sharing, but seem
aimed at other goals.2
The record label’s goal must therefore be to retard disc-
to-disc copying and other local copying and use of the
music. Stopping local copying might increase sales of
the music—if Alice cannot copy a CD to give to Bob,
Bob might buy the CD himself.
Control over local uses can translate into more revenue
for the record label. For example, if the label can control
Alice’s ability to download music from a CD into her
iPod, the label might be able to charge Alice an extra fee
for iPod downloads. Charging for iPod downloads cre-
ates new revenue, but it also reduces the value to users of
the original CD and therefore reduces revenue from CD
sales. Whether the new revenue will outweigh the loss
of CD revenue is a complex economic question that de-
pends on detailed assumptions about users’ preferences;
generally, increasing the label’s control over uses of the
music will tend to increase the label’s proﬁt.
Whether the label would ﬁnd it more proﬁtable to con-
trol a use, as opposed to granting it for free to CD pur-
chasers, is a separate question from whether copyright
law gives the label the right to ﬁle lawsuits relating to
that use. Using DRM to enforce copyright law exactly
as written is almost certainly not the record label’s proﬁt-
maximizing strategy.
Besides controlling use of the music, CD DRM can
make money for the record label because it puts software
onto users’ computers, and the label can monetize this in-
stalled platform. For example, each CD DRM album in-
cludes a special application for listening to the protected
music. This application can show advertisements or cre-
ate other promotional value for the label; or the platform
can gather information about the user’s activities, which
can be exploited for some business purpose. If taken too
far, these become spyware tactics; but they may be pur-
sued more moderately, even over user objections, if the
label believes the beneﬁts outweigh the costs.
2.2 DRM Vendor Goals
The CD DRM vendor’s primary goal is to create value
for the record label in order to maximize the price the
label will pay for the DRM technology. In this respect,
the vendor’s and label’s incentives are aligned.
However, the vendor’s incentives diverge from the la-
bel’s in at least two ways. First, the vendor has a higher
risk tolerance than the label, because the label is a large,
established business with a valuable brand name, while
the vendor (at least in the cases at issue here) is a start-
up company with few assets and not much brand equity.
Start-ups face many risks already and are therefore less
averse to taking on one more risk. The record label, on
the other hand, has much more capital and brand equity
to lose if something goes horribly wrong. Accordingly,
we can expect the vendor to be much more willing to
accept security risks than the label.
The second incentive difference is that the vendor can
monetize the installed platform in ways the record label
cannot. For example, once the vendor’s DRM software is
installed on a user’s system, the software can control use
of other labels’ CDs, so a larger installed base makes the
vendor’s technology more attractive to other labels. This
extra incentive to build the installed base will make the
vendor more aggressive about pushing the software onto
users’ computers than the label would be.
In short, incentive differences make the vendor more
likely than the label to (a) cut corners and accept secu-
rity risks, and (b) push DRM software onto more users’

computers. If the label had perfect knowledge about the
vendor’s technology, this incentive gap would not be an
issue—the label would simply insist that the vendor pro-
tect the label’s interests. But if, as seems likely in prac-
tice, the label has imperfect knowledge of the technology,
then the vendor will sometimes act against the label’s in-
terests.
(For a discussion of differing incentives in an-
other content protection context, see [9].)
2.3 DRM and Market Power
DRM affects more than just the relationships among the
label, the vendor, and the user. It also impacts the label’s
and vendor’s positions in their industries, in ways that
will shape the companies’ DRM strategies.
For example, DRM vendors are in a kind of standards
war—a company that controls DRM standards has power
to shape the online music business. DRM vendors ﬁght
this battle by spreading their platforms widely. Record
labels want to play DRM vendors off against each other
and prevent any one vendor from achieving dominance.
Major record companies such as Sony-BMG are parts
of larger, diversiﬁed companies, and can be expected to
help bolster the competitive position of their corporate
siblings. For example, parts of Sony sell portable music
players in competition with Apple, so Sony-BMG has an
incentive to take steps to weaken Apple’s market power.
Having examined the goals and motivations of the
record labels and DRM vendors, we now turn to a de-
scription of the technologies they deployed.
3 CD DRM Systems
CD DRM systems must meet difﬁcult requirements.
Copy protected discs must be reasonably compliant with
the CD Digital Audio standard so that they can play in or-
dinary CD players. They must be unreadable by almost
all computer programs in order to prevent copying, yet
the DRM vendor’s own software must be able to read
them in order to give the user some access to the music.
Most CD DRM systems use both passive and active
anti-copying measures. Passive measures change the
disc’s contents in the hope of confusing most computer
drives and software, without confusing most audio CD
players. Active measures, in contrast, rely on software
on the computer that actively intervenes to block access
to the music by programs other than the DRM vendor’s
own software.
Active protection software must be installed on the
computer somehow. XCP and MediaMax use Windows
autorun, which (when enabled) automatically loads and
runs software from a disc when the disc is inserted into
the computer’s drive. Autorun lets the DRM vendor’s
software run or install immediately.
Once the DRM software is installed, every time a
new CD is inserted the software runs a recognition al-
gorithm to determine whether the disc is associated with
the DRM scheme. If it is, the active protection software
will interfere with accesses to the disc, except those orig-
inating from the vendor’s own music player application.
This proprietary player application, which is shipped on
the disc, gives the user limited access to the music.
As we will discuss further, all parts of this design are
subject to attack by a user who wants to copy the music
illegally or who wants to make uses allowed by copy-
right law but blocked by the DRM. The user can defeat
the passive protection, stop the DRM software from in-
stalling itself, trick the recognition algorithm, defeat the
active protection software’s blocking, capture the music
from the DRM vendor’s player, or uninstall the protec-
tion software.
The complexity of today’s CD DRM software offers
many avenues of attack. On the whole, today’s systems
are no more resistant to attack than were simpler early
CD DRM systems [10, 11]. When there are fundamental
limits to security, extra complexity does not mean extra
security.
Discs Studied Sony deployed XCP on 52 titles (rep-
resenting more than 4.7 million CDs) [1]. We exam-
ined three of them in detail: Acceptance, Phantoms
(2005); Susie Suh, Susie Suh (2005); and Switchfoot,
Nothing is Sound (2005). MediaMax was deployed on
37 Sony titles (over 20 million CDs) as well as dozens
of titles from other labels [1]. We studied three al-
bums that used MediaMax version 3—Velvet Revolver,
Contraband (BMG, 2004); Dave Matthews Band, Stand
Up (Sony, 2005); and Anthony Hamilton, Comin’ from
Where I’m From (Arista/Sony 2005)—and three albums
that used MediaMax version 5—Peter Cetera, You Just
Gotta Love Christmas (Viastar, 2004); Babyface, Grown
and Sexy (Arista/Sony, 2005); and My Morning Jacket, Z
(ATO/Sony, 2005). Unless otherwise noted, statements
about MediaMax apply to both version 3 and version 5.

Installation
Active protection measures cannot begin to operate until
the DRM software is installed on the user’s system. In
this section we consider attacks that either prevent instal-
lation of the DRM software, or capture music ﬁles from
the disc in the interval after the disc has been inserted but
before the DRM software is installed on the computer.
4.1 Autorun
Both XCP and MediaMax rely on the autorun feature of
Windows. Whenever removable media, such as a ﬂoppy
