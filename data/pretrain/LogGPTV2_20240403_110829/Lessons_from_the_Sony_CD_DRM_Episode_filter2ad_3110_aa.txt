## Abstract
In the fall of 2005, issues discovered in two Sony-BMG compact disc copy protection systems, XCP and MediaMax, sparked a public outcry that led to class-action litigation and the recall of millions of discs. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of these technologies, including their design, implementation, and deployment. The systems are notably complex and suffer from various flaws that compromise content protection and expose users to significant security and privacy risks. Their complexity and failure make them an interesting case study in digital rights management (DRM), offering valuable lessons for content companies, DRM vendors, policymakers, end users, and the security community.

## 1. Introduction
This paper presents a detailed case study of the design, implementation, and deployment of anti-copying technologies. We provide a technical analysis of the security and privacy implications of two systems, XCP and MediaMax, developed by First4Internet and SunnComm, respectively, and distributed on millions of music CDs by Sony-BMG, the world's second-largest record company. We examine the design choices made by these companies and evaluate the consequences of those choices. The lessons learned are not only applicable to compact disc copy protection but also to copy protection systems in general.

The security and privacy implications of Sony-BMG’s CD DRM technologies first came to light on October 31, 2005, in a blog post by Mark Russinovich. While testing a rootkit detector, Russinovich discovered an apparent rootkit (software designed to hide an intruder's presence) on his system, which was part of the XCP DRM system installed when he inserted a Sony-BMG music CD into his computer's CD drive.

News of Russinovich’s discovery spread rapidly online, leading to further revelations. It was found that the XCP rootkit made users' systems more vulnerable to attacks, both CD DRM schemes installed risky software components without informed user consent, covertly transmitted usage information back to the vendor or music label, and did not include tools for uninstalling the software. These findings outraged many users.

As the story gained media attention and public pressure mounted, Sony-BMG agreed to recall XCP discs and issue uninstallers for both XCP and MediaMax. However, we discovered that both uninstallers created serious security vulnerabilities. Class-action lawsuits were filed, and government investigations were launched as Sony-BMG worked to repair its relationship with customers.

While Sony-BMG and its DRM vendors were at the center of this incident, its implications extend beyond Sony-BMG and compact discs. This case study provides insights into the deployment of DRM in a mature market for recorded media, with many of the lessons applicable to other DRM markets.

Several themes emerge from this case study: the similarities between DRM and malicious software such as spyware, the temptation for DRM vendors to adopt malware tactics, the erosion of privacy by DRM, the strategic use of access control to control markets, the failure of ad hoc designs, and the role of differing incentives in shaping behavior and causing conflict.

### Outline
- **Section 2:** Discusses the business incentives of record labels and DRM vendors.
- **Section 3:** Provides a high-level technical summary of the systems' design.
- **Sections 4–9:** Cover specific aspects of the design in detail, including installation issues, recognition of protected discs, player software, deactivation attacks, uninstallation issues, and compatibility and upgrading issues.
- **Section 10:** Explores the user outrage in response to the DRM problems.
- **Section 11:** Concludes and draws lessons for other systems.

## 2. Goals and Incentives
The primary goal of a CD DRM system is economic: to protect and enable the business models of the record label and the DRM vendor. Any discussion of goals and incentives must consider the business models of these actors, whose interests may not always align. Incentive gaps can be crucial in explaining the design and deployment of CD DRM systems.

### 2.1 Record Label Goals
Record labels aim to prevent unauthorized distribution of music, particularly through peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks. However, it is nearly impossible to stop P2P sharing entirely, as even one unprotected copy can be shared globally. Instead, real-world CD DRM systems focus on retarding disc-to-disc copying and other local uses of the music. Stopping local copying might increase sales, as users would need to purchase additional copies. Control over local uses can also generate new revenue, such as charging extra fees for iPod downloads, though this may reduce the value of the original CD and overall sales.

Additionally, CD DRM can create a platform for monetization. For example, each DRM-protected album includes a special application for listening to the music, which can show advertisements or gather user data. If taken too far, these practices can be seen as spyware tactics, but they may be pursued if the label believes the benefits outweigh the costs.

### 2.2 DRM Vendor Goals
The primary goal of a CD DRM vendor is to create value for the record label to maximize the price the label will pay for the technology. However, the vendor's incentives differ from the label's in two key ways:

1. **Risk Tolerance:** Vendors, often startups, have a higher risk tolerance than established labels, making them more willing to accept security risks.
2. **Monetization of Installed Base:** Vendors can monetize the installed base of their software by controlling the use of other labels' CDs, making them more aggressive in pushing their software onto users' computers.

These incentive differences mean that vendors are more likely to cut corners and accept security risks, and to push their software onto more users' systems. If the label had perfect knowledge of the vendor's technology, this would not be an issue, but in practice, the label's imperfect knowledge can lead to actions that go against the label's interests.

### 2.3 DRM and Market Power
DRM also impacts the label's and vendor's positions in their industries. For example, DRM vendors compete in a standards war, with the company controlling the standards having significant power. Record labels want to prevent any one vendor from achieving dominance, and major labels like Sony-BMG may take steps to weaken competitors, such as Apple, in the portable music player market.

Having examined the goals and motivations of the record labels and DRM vendors, we now turn to a description of the technologies they deployed.

## 3. CD DRM Systems
CD DRM systems must meet challenging requirements. Copy-protected discs must be compliant with the CD Digital Audio standard to play in ordinary CD players, yet be unreadable by most computer programs to prevent copying. Most CD DRM systems use both passive and active anti-copying measures.

- **Passive Measures:** Alter the disc's contents to confuse most computer drives and software without affecting audio CD players.
- **Active Measures:** Rely on software installed on the computer to block access to the music by unauthorized programs.

The active protection software must be installed on the computer, typically using Windows autorun, which automatically loads and runs software from the disc when inserted. Once installed, the software recognizes protected discs and blocks unauthorized access, except through the vendor's proprietary player application.

All parts of this design are subject to attack by users who want to copy the music illegally or make uses allowed by copyright law but blocked by the DRM. Users can defeat passive protection, prevent DRM software installation, trick the recognition algorithm, bypass the active protection, capture music from the player, or uninstall the protection software.

The complexity of today's CD DRM software offers many avenues of attack. Despite their complexity, these systems are no more resistant to attack than simpler early CD DRM systems. When there are fundamental limits to security, extra complexity does not equate to extra security.

### Discs Studied
Sony deployed XCP on 52 titles (over 4.7 million CDs). We examined three in detail: "Acceptance, Phantoms" (2005), "Susie Suh, Susie Suh" (2005), and "Switchfoot, Nothing is Sound" (2005). MediaMax was deployed on 37 Sony titles (over 20 million CDs) and dozens of other labels' titles. We studied three albums with MediaMax version 3 and three with version 5. Unless otherwise noted, statements about MediaMax apply to both versions.

## 4. Installation
Active protection measures cannot operate until the DRM software is installed on the user's system. This section considers attacks that prevent the installation of DRM software or capture music files from the disc before the software is installed.

### 4.1 Autorun
Both XCP and MediaMax rely on the autorun feature of Windows, which automatically loads and runs software from removable media when inserted.
