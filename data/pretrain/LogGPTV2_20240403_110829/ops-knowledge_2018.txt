User: How to optimize the performance of Linux server and reduce IO latency? Please provide some best practices.
Assistant: Here are some best practices that may help optimize Linux server performance and reduce IO latency: 1. Tune system kernel parameters - Use sysctl commands to tune kernel parameters to suit specific application and server configurations. For example, the vm.dirty_ratio and vm.dirty_background_ratio parameters in sysctl can control memory pressure. 2. Use Solid State Drives (SSD) - Using SSDs instead of traditional mechanical hard drives on your server can significantly reduce IO latency. 3. Enable memory caching - Linux system contains many memory caching mechanisms, such as Page Cache, Buffer Cache and SLAB Cache. Under the right circumstances, enabling these caches can improve system performance. 4. Install RAID - RAID technology can combine multiple hard disks into a disk array to improve system disk IO throughput and fault tolerance. 5. Use a faster network connection - If the network connection is the bottleneck, using a higher bandwidth network connection, such as Gigabit Ethernet or fiber optic network, can significantly increase the data transfer speed. 6. Optimizing the application - Optimizing at the application level, such as using caching, reducing read and write disk operations, moving some calculations to the client, etc. 7. Avoid using RAID-5 mode and VMware Server - RAID-5 mode is more fault-tolerant than RAID-0, but will cause performance degradation when writing to a single disk. VMware Server also generates a large number of IO requests, which increases IO latency. 8. Perform regular disk defragmentation and cleaning - Running disk defragmentation and cleaning regularly can reduce file fragmentation and thus improve disk read and write speed. The extent to which these best practices are implemented varies by environment and application and should be optimized on a case-by-case basis.
