Question: In an application security audit, you discover that an application's Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) mechanism can be bypassed by submitting a series of automated requests that sequentially test different passcodes. Which of the following vulnerabilities is most likely present in the MFA implementation?
"A": "The MFA mechanism lacks a lockout mechanism to prevent brute-force attacks.",
"B": "The MFA mechanism sends passcodes via email, which is considered insecure.",
"C": "The MFA uses an outdated encryption algorithm for passcode generation.",
"D": "The MFA requires three factors, making it more secure and therefore not vulnerable to automated requests."
Answer: A
