ABSTRACT
The two largest U.S. wireless ISPs have recently moved to-
wards usage-based pricing to better manage the growing de-
mand on their networks. Yet usage-based pricing still re-
quires ISPs to over-provision capacity for demand at peak
times of the day. Time-dependent pricing (TDP) addresses
this problem by considering when a user consumes data,
in addition to how much is used. We present the architec-
ture, implementation, and a user trial of an end-to-end TDP
system called TUBE. TUBE creates a price-based feedback
control loop between an ISP and its end users. On the ISP
side, it computes TDP prices so as to balance the cost of
congestion during peak periods with that of oﬀering lower
prices in less congested periods. On mobile devices, it pro-
vides a graphical user interface that allows users to respond
to the oﬀered prices either by themselves or using an “au-
topilot” mode. We conducted a pilot TUBE trial with 50
iPhone or iPad 3G data users, who were charged according
to our TDP algorithms. Our results show that TDP bene-
ﬁts both operators and customers, ﬂattening the temporal
ﬂuctuation of demand while allowing users to save money
by choosing the time and volume of their usage.

INTRODUCTION
While researchers have proposed diﬀerent plans for pric-
ing data usage for many years, wireless ISPs have tradition-
ally used only ﬂat-rate, usage-based, or simple day/night
charging. However, the recent rapid growth in demand for
data [2] is forcing them to explore new ways to match rev-
enues to costs. Dynamic time-dependent pricing (TDP) is
one way to do so. With TDP, an ISP can oﬀer lower prices
in less-congested periods, incentivizing users to shift their

usage from peak to oﬀ-peak periods. In fact, many appli-
cations today, e.g., movie or software downloads and cloud
data synchronization, have signiﬁcant delay tolerances and
can be deferred to low usage periods if proper incentives are
provided. Other applications can tolerate shorter, but still
useful, delays. These deferrals can reduce the peak traﬃc:
our partner ISP data shows that the demand in peak hours
can be ten times that in oﬀ-peak hours. Even within ten
minutes, demand can vary by a factor of two. TDP leverages
this traﬃc pattern to help ISPs reduce the cost of peak-load
provisioning for their networks, while allowing users to save
money by choosing the time of their usage.
Implementing such a TDP plan requires architecting and
prototyping a fully functional system that enables ISPs to of-
fer prices acceptable to both themselves and end users. Ad-
ditionally, it requires developing simple and intuitive GUIs
that let users view and respond to the oﬀered prices.
In
this paper, we present the design, implementation, and pilot
trial evaluation of the TUBE (Time-dependent Usage-based
Broadband price Engineering) system for mobile data [18].
1.1 Matching Price to Cost
The proliferation of high-speed LTE, smartphones, tablets,
bandwidth-hungry apps, and cloud-based services has brought
about an explosive growth in wireless Internet usage. The
heavy tail of this usage distribution, which largely drives
ISPs’ operational costs, has led to the demise of ‘ﬂat rate’
unlimited data plans in countries like the U.S. [5, 24, 28].
ISPs are now pursuing measures such as tiered usage pric-
ing, overage charges, aggressive throttling, and service dis-
continuation to alleviate congestion on their networks [1].
By the spring of 2012, both AT&T and Verizon Wireless
had announced updates to their mobile data usage policies,
eﬀectively imposing usage-based pricing of about $10/GB
[6]. But as Clark [3] observed:
The fundamental problem with simple usage fees is
that they impose usage costs on users regardless of
whether the network is congested or not.
Moreover, usage-based fees fail to address ISPs’ real prob-
lem. Heavy users typically congest the network at the same
time, resulting in large demand peaks that force ISPs to
over-provision network capacity and incur costs accordingly.
Solving this problem requires a viable economic model and
system capability for charging users by not only how much
data they consume but also when they do so. This idea of
‘responsive pricing’ was advocated by Mackie-Mason et al.
[14] as early as 1995 when the commercial Internet was still
evolving:
247We argue that a feedback signal in the form of a vari-
able price for network service is a workable tool to
aid network operators in controlling Internet traﬃc.
We suggest that these prices should vary dynamically
based on the current utilization of network resources.
The general concept of congestion pricing has been stud-
ied in the energy, transportation, telephone, ATM, and IP
network research communities for several decades. Only re-
cently, however, has congestion-dependent pricing become
realistic for mobile data. For example, Uninor in India
and MTN in Uganda already oﬀer congestion- and location-
dependent pricing for voice calls [25].
1.2 Opportunities and Challenges
Time-dependent pricing for mobile data is a natural step
in the transition from simple usage pricing to congestion-
dependent pricing. Unlike voice calls, many mobile apps
have diﬀerent degrees of time sensitivity and do not re-
quire real-time data transfers or user interactivity. Time-
dependent pricing can exploit these features to create ef-
fective price incentives for users to ﬂatten their temporal
demand proﬁle by adjusting prices to user response. But
TDP for mobile data also presents several new technological
and social challenges:
• How can ISPs compute price incentives that they are
• Can we develop economic models that can be easily
• What are the key system design challenges?
• How can we assess the beneﬁts of TDP?
• Will real users respond to TDP favorably?
• How can we minimize user interaction from the client
willing to oﬀer and users are ready to accept?
estimated from real data?
side?
Answering each of these questions requires signiﬁcant eﬀort
in conducting consumer surveys, developing analytical mod-
els, building a system prototype, and ﬁnally running trials
with real users. The aim and scope of such an undertaking
echoes those of the Berkeley INDEX project for usage-based
wireline pricing [27] and the work in [21] for voice calls. Yet
the present context of wireless TDP introduces new require-
ments, challenges, and opportunities, including the follow-
ing:
Dynamic TDP: To compute time-dependent prices, ISPs
must estimate the amount of usage that will be shifted to
lower-price periods as a function of the prices oﬀered. How-
ever, this estimation should change over time: as an ISP
oﬀers time-dependent prices and observes the resulting net-
work demand, it must adjust and improve its estimates of
user reaction to the prices oﬀered to better reﬂect the us-
age observed. These changes in user behavior estimates then
prompt changes in the prices oﬀered, forming a feedback loop
interaction shown in Fig. 1.
User behavior estimation: Given the prices oﬀered
over a day, users will shift diﬀerent amounts of diﬀerent
types of traﬃc to lower-price periods. For instance, some
users may wait for ﬁve minutes but not an hour to stream
movies. Similarly, a user may wait to refresh a personalized
news magazine, but not to download urgent email attach-
ments. The ISP’s model of user behavior must therefore
account for this heterogeneity in users’ reactions to the of-
fered prices. It must also be readily adjustable to observed
changes in aggregate demand across users.

User experience: When prices are published to users’
mobile devices, each user optimizes her behavior to satisfy
her goals, e.g., spending less than a certain monthly budget.
Most users, however, will not manually optimize their usage
to do so. Thus, TDP requires an “autopilot” mode that can
automatically schedule usage for users. To make the system
scalable to multiple users and prevent privacy violations,
this autopilot should operate separately from the ISP.
1.3 TUBE Contributions
While prototyping and deploying TUBE in a trial with
3G data users, we focus on ﬁve main features:
A fully functional system for oﬀering TDP for mo-
bile data. Deploying TDP as a new mobile data pricing
plan requires taking this idea from economic theory to a fully
integrated system. We build a model for dynamic TDP that
incorporates evolving user behavior, populate the model pa-
rameters from user surveys, design a supporting architec-
ture, implement a prototype, and, ﬁnally, run a pilot trial
with real users.
An architecture using feedback control. TUBE cre-
ates a feedback loop between the ISP server, which com-
putes the prices to oﬀer users, and the users who respond
to the oﬀered prices. The ISP oﬀers prices on a day-ahead
basis: at any given time, users know the prices for the next
twenty-four hours. Day-ahead prices provide some certainty
for users to plan ahead, while allowing ISPs to adjust prices
each day according to revised user behavior estimates.1
User behavior models and optimized price compu-
tation. We propose an economic model of user behavior, as
well as an algorithm for dynamically estimating relevant pa-
rameters from aggregate demand. The model helps predict
usage for subsequent TDP periods, allowing the ISP to op-
timize its prices. These prices balance the cost of handling
high demand relative to capacity with that of oﬀering price
discounts to users.
An user interface design. We study psychological as-
pects of user interaction and oﬀer an autopilot mode for
scheduling apps that minimizes “human-in-the-loop” issues.
Users are thus able to optimize their usage with respect to
the time-dependent prices independent of the ISP.
A realistic evaluation with real users. We recruited
50 iPhone/iPad 3G users on our university campus as trial
participants. We charged participants according to TDP by
deploying the TUBE prototype on our server and participant
devices. Our results indicate that users indeed respond to
prices: when oﬀered monetary discounts, they will shift their
demand from peak- to oﬀ-peak periods and even consume
more in oﬀ-peak periods.

Pricing for sudden increases in demand due to special events
can also be accommodated.

between a user device and ISP servers are the prices and

Empowering user control: The user interface displays
the prices oﬀered and corresponding device usage, allowing
users to educate themselves about their data consumption
and schedule their usage according to the prices oﬀered. To
facilitate this educational component, we use simple and in-
tuitive GUI designs.
2.2 Estimating User Behavior
In order to set time-dependent prices, ISPs monitor users’
traﬃc patterns, i.e., the volume of traﬃc at diﬀerent times,
with and without TDP. This data is then used to estimate
users’ willingness to shift their traﬃc in exchange for a mon-
etary discount. The estimates are used to calculate the time-
dependent prices for the next day, linking the prices and user
behavior in the system’s feedback loop (Figs. 1 and 2).
In this section, we ﬁrst discuss a parameterized model of
user behavior and use consumer survey results to initial-
ize the parameter values. We then provide an algorithm to
update these user behavior estimates and evaluate its eﬀec-
tiveness on simulated data.
2.2.1 Modeling Delay Tolerances
Users’ willingness to wait for data usage depends on the
type of session under consideration:
for instance, iTunes
downloads can often be more readily delayed than streaming
YouTube videos. Thus, we view each user as a set of appli-
cation sessions, e.g., streaming, browsing, and ﬁle transfer
sessions. Sessions are assumed to have a ﬁxed minimum
bandwidth requirement, which is particularly appropriate
for streaming sessions.
In general, users’ willingness to defer any given application
session depends on two factors: the monetary reward for
deferring the session and the time for which the session is
deferred. For instance, users may wait for 1 hour to watch
a video in exchange for $2, but may not wait if oﬀered only
$1. At the same time, users may not wait more than one
hour, even if oﬀered the $2 reward.
In order to quantify users’ willingness to defer applica-
tion sessions, we introduce the concept of waiting functions.
These functions give the probability that users will defer an
application session for a given amount of time τ in exchange
for a discount d, e.g., d $/GB from some baseline metered
price. Since diﬀerent users and applications may have dis-
tinct waiting functions, we choose a parameterized form of
the waiting functions, with diﬀerent parameters correspond-
ing to diﬀerent levels of user patience. These parameters
thus quantify the various price-delay tradeoﬀs correspond-
ing to diﬀerent users and application sessions.
The chosen form of the waiting functions should be de-
creasing in the time deferred, τ , and concave and increasing
in the discount oﬀered d: users will be less likely to defer as
the time deferred increases but will be more likely to defer
if oﬀered a larger monetary reward. While many functional
forms are reasonable, we choose the simple form
wρ(d, τ ) =
d
λρ(τ + 1)ρ ,
