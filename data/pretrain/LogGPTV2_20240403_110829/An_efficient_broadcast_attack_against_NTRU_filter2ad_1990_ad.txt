from every recipient’s ciphertext, diﬀering from eliminating
r by using ergodic in [11]. However, our method doesn’t
work against NTRU with encryption padding.
4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
All experiments were performed on a Windows XP system
with a 2.93 GHz Pentium 4 processor and 4 GByte RAM
using Shoup’s NTL library version 5.4.1 [28].
We implemented the broadcast attacks against three vari-
ants of NTRU. For NTRU-1998 and NTRU-2001, we adopted
the algorithms for u = 1. In our experiments, we always ob-
tained an matrix L, whose the rank equals to N + [ N
2 ]. The
number of recipients is just a little more than the number
of variables (denoted by T). Since the number of variables
is small, the experiment evidence indicates that our algo-
rithm can eﬃciently broadcast attack against NTRU with
very large parameters. Some results against NTRU with
the highest security parameters are listed below:

5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we ﬁrst discuss the ergodic-linearization al-
gorithm against GGH, then naturally deduce new and uni-
form broadcast attacks against several variants of NTRU,
which is based on the special structure of blinding value
space Lr. From which we can see two main lines to study the
algebraic broadcast attacks: one is decreasing the number
of variables; the other is increasing the number of equations.
Now, the main question is that how to do the broadcast at-
tacks against NTRU, GGH and other cryptosystems more
eﬃciently if the error vectors lack of the special structure.

Because, for any vector v = (v0, v1,··· , vN−1)T , we set
v(i) = (vN−i, vN−i+1,··· , vN−1, v0, v1,··· , vN−i−1)T , for i ∈
{1, 2,··· , N − 1} and v(0) = v. Then Hg(i) = Ei+1 mod q,
where Ei is a column vector whose i-th entry is 1 and else
are 0. What’s more, it’s easy to implies that HG = I mod q
1CCCA mod q,
1CCCA .
⇔ Hg = E1 mod q ⇔ g ∗ h = 1 over Zq[x]/(xN − 1). Using
Extended Euclidean Algorithm for xN − 1 and h in Zq[x],
we can get g with O(N 2) arithmetic operations. Thus, the
corresponding circular matrix of g is H−1.
If G, H ∈ ZN×N
q
are circular matrices, for i, j ∈ {1, 2,··· , N},
we have
(GH)i,j = gi−1hN−j+1 + gi−2hN−j+2 + ··· + gihN−j

=
glhN−j+i−l.
Therefore, the number of families is:

Hence, (GH)i,j = (GH)N−j+i+1,1, for i, j ∈ {1, 2,··· , N},
i.e. GH is also a circular matrix. In particular, HT H is a
symmetric circular matrix. Hence, (HT H)i,1 = (HT H)1,i =
(HT H)N +2−i,1, for i ∈ {1, 2,··· , N}. It’s suﬃcient to calcu-
late {(HT H)1,1, (HT H)2,1,··· , (HT H)[ N
2 ]+1,1}, which re-
quires (2N − 1)([ N
2 ] + 1) arithmetic operations.
B. PROOF OF THEOREM 2.5
Theorem 2.5 is equivalent to consider the set of n× (n + l)
matrices with entries in Fq. We count the number of matri-
ces of the form (b1, b2,··· , bn+1) of rank n, where bi ∈ Zn
q .
Denote by Bk the subspace spanned by b1, b2,··· , bk, with
the convention B0 being the nullspace. Recall that a k-
dimensional subspace has cardinality qk. For each family
(b1, b2,··· , bn+1) of rank n, there exists a unique i such
that b1, b2,··· , bi−1 are linearly independent, bi ∈ Bi−1,
k=0(qn − qk)
possibilities for b1, b2,··· , bi−1. There are qi−1 choices
k=i−1(qn − qk) possibilities for
bi+1, bi+2,··· , bn+1.
It follows that the total number of
families is:
and for all j > i, bj 6∈ Bj−1. There are Qi−2
for bi. And there are Qn−1
qi−1
(qn − qk) = qn(n+1)
(1 − q
−k).
i=1
k=0
k=2
Now, consider a family (b1, b2,··· , bn+2) of rank n. There
exists a unique (i, j) with i  j, bt 6∈ Bt−1. That
way, we know the dimension of Bt for all t, and therefore,
the number of (b1, b2,··· , bn+2) corresponding to a given
(i, j) is:
i−2Y
(qn − qk)× qi−1 × j−3Y
(qn − qk)× qj−2 × n−1Y
(qn − qk).
k=0
k=i−1
k=j−2
It follows that the total number of families of rank n is:
n+1X
n−1Y
n+2X
n−1Y
(qn − qk) × n+1X
n+1X
k=0
qi+n − q2i−2
i=1
j=i+1
Then compute the double sum:
n+1X
n+2X
qi+j−3 =
i=1
j=i+1
i=1
qi+j−3.

(qn+2 − 1)(qn+1 − 1)
