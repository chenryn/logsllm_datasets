## 4. Experimental Results

All experiments were conducted on a Windows XP system, equipped with a 2.93 GHz Pentium 4 processor and 4 GB of RAM, using Shoup's NTL library version 5.4.1 [28].

We implemented broadcast attacks against three variants of NTRU: NTRU-1998, NTRU-2001, and NTRU-2005. For NTRU-1998 and NTRU-2001, we used the algorithms for \( u = 1 \). In our experiments, we consistently obtained a matrix \( L \) whose rank equals \( N + \left\lfloor \frac{N}{2} \right\rfloor \). The number of recipients is slightly greater than the number of variables (denoted by \( T \)). Since the number of variables is relatively small, experimental evidence suggests that our algorithm can efficiently perform broadcast attacks against NTRU with very large parameters. Below are some results for NTRU with the highest security parameters:

| Variant      | N | q | p | df | dg | dr | T | Recipients | Rank(L) | Time (secs) | Result |
|--------------|---|---|---|----|----|----|---|------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| NTRU-1998    | 503 | 256 | 3 | 216 | 72 | 55 | 754 | 757 | 754 | 591 | Success |
| NTRU-2001    | 503 | 256 | 3 | 216 | 75 | 55 | 754 | 756 | 754 | 576 | Success |
| NTRU-2005    | 787 | 587 | 2 | 140 | 140 | 140 | 1180 | 1183 | 1180 | 2093 | Success |

## 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we first discuss the ergodic-linearization algorithm against GGH, and then naturally deduce new and uniform broadcast attacks against several variants of NTRU. These attacks are based on the special structure of the blinding value space \( L_r \). From this, we identify two main approaches to studying algebraic broadcast attacks: reducing the number of variables and increasing the number of equations. The primary challenge now is to develop more efficient broadcast attacks against NTRU, GGH, and other cryptosystems when the error vectors lack a special structure.

## Appendix

### A. How to Compute \( H^{-1} \) and \( H^T H \)

Let \( g = (g_0, g_1, \ldots, g_{N-1})^T \) satisfy:
\[ H g = E_1 \mod q \]
where \( E_1 \) is a column vector with 1 in the first entry and 0 elsewhere. Since \( H \in \mathbb{C}^{N \times N} \) is invertible over \( \mathbb{Z}_q \), \( g \) has a unique solution over \( \mathbb{Z}_q \). Thus,
\[ H^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
g_0 & g_1 & \cdots & g_{N-1} \\
g_{N-1} & g_0 & \cdots & g_{N-2} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
g_1 & g_2 & \cdots & g_0
\end{pmatrix} \mod q \]

For any vector \( v = (v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{N-1})^T \), define \( v(i) = (v_{N-i}, v_{N-i+1}, \ldots, v_{N-1}, v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{N-i-1})^T \) for \( i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N-1\} \) and \( v(0) = v \). Then \( H g(i) = E_{i+1} \mod q \), where \( E_i \) is a column vector with 1 in the \( i \)-th entry and 0 elsewhere. It follows that \( HG = I \mod q \).

Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for \( x^N - 1 \) and \( h \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_q[x] \), we can find \( g \) with \( O(N^2) \) arithmetic operations. The corresponding circular matrix of \( g \) is \( H^{-1} \).

If \( G, H \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{N \times N} \) are circular matrices, for \( i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\} \), we have:
\[ (GH)_{i,j} = \sum_{l=0}^{N-1} g_l h_{N-j+i-l} \]
\[ (GH)_{N-j+i+1,1} = \sum_{l=0}^{N-1} g_l h_{N-j+i-l} \]

Thus, \( (GH)_{i,j} = (GH)_{N-j+i+1,1} \) for \( i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\} \), meaning \( GH \) is also a circular matrix. Specifically, \( H^T H \) is a symmetric circular matrix. Therefore, it is sufficient to calculate \( \{(H^T H)_{1,1}, (H^T H)_{2,1}, \ldots, (H^T H)_{\left\lfloor \frac{N}{2} \right\rfloor + 1,1}\} \), which requires \( (2N - 1)\left(\left\lfloor \frac{N}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\right) \) arithmetic operations.

### B. Proof of Theorem 2.5

Theorem 2.5 is equivalent to considering the set of \( n \times (n + l) \) matrices with entries in \( \mathbb{F}_q \). We count the number of matrices of the form \( (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n+1}) \) of rank \( n \), where \( b_i \in \mathbb{Z}_q^n \). Denote by \( B_k \) the subspace spanned by \( b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k \), with \( B_0 \) being the nullspace. Recall that a \( k \)-dimensional subspace has cardinality \( q^k \).

For each family \( (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n+1}) \) of rank \( n \), there exists a unique \( i \) such that \( b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{i-1} \) are linearly independent, \( b_i \in B_{i-1} \), and for all \( j > i \), \( b_j \notin B_{j-1} \). There are \( \prod_{k=0}^{i-2} (q^n - q^k) \) possibilities for \( b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{i-1} \). There are \( q^{i-1} \) choices for \( b_i \), and there are \( \prod_{k=i-1}^{n-1} (q^n - q^k) \) possibilities for \( b_{i+1}, b_{i+2}, \ldots, b_{n+1} \).

Thus, the total number of families is:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \left( \prod_{k=0}^{i-2} (q^n - q^k) \right) \cdot q^{i-1} \cdot \left( \prod_{k=i-1}^{n-1} (q^n - q^k) \right) \]

Now, consider a family \( (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n+2}) \) of rank \( n \). There exists a unique \( (i, j) \) with \( i < j \) such that \( b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{i-1} \) are linearly independent, \( b_i \in B_{i-1} \), and for all \( t > j \), \( b_t \notin B_{t-1} \). The number of such families is:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n+2} \left( \prod_{k=0}^{i-2} (q^n - q^k) \right) \cdot q^{i-1} \cdot \left( \prod_{k=i-1}^{j-3} (q^n - q^k) \right) \cdot q^{j-2} \cdot \left( \prod_{k=j-2}^{n-1} (q^n - q^k) \right) \]

Compute the double sum:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n+2} q^{i+j-3} = \frac{q^{n+2} - 1}{q - 1} \cdot \frac{q^{n+1} - 1}{q^2 - 1} \]

Thus, the total number of families of rank \( n \) is:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (q^n - q^k) \]
