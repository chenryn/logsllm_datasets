**Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
I get three "Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent."
warnings when I 'make html' in sqlalchemy/doc/build.
    (mydevenv)diana@diana-laptop:~/workspace/sqlalchemy/doc/build$ make html
    mkdir -p output/html output/doctrees
    sphinx-build -b html -A mako_layout=html -d output/doctrees   . output/html

The sphinx docs say:
"Nested lists are possible, but be aware that they must be separated from the
parent list items by blank lines:"
    * this is
    * a list
      * with a nested list
      * and some subitems
    * and here the parent list continues

Attached is a diff.
Some 'id' attribute values change as a result of this diff -- I'm totally new
to sphinx & not sure if this matters. For example:
    (mydevenv)diana@diana-laptop:~/workspace/sqlalchemy/doc/build$ diff /home/diana/dbengine.html.before /home/diana/dbengine.html.after

Also, are there tests I should run for the docs? I did run 'python setup.pt
test':
    Ran 2141 tests in 230.564s
    OK
Note that this is my first ever ticket and diff to an open source project, so
please let me know if I'm doing something wrong.
