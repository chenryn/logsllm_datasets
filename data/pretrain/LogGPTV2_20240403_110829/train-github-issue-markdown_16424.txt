**Migrated Issue, Originally Created by Anonymous**

When running `make html` in the `sqlalchemy/doc/build` directory, I encounter three warnings related to bullet lists not ending with a blank line and unexpected unindentation. Below are the details:

```bash
(mydevenv)diana@diana-laptop:~/workspace/sqlalchemy/doc/build$ make html
mkdir -p output/html output/doctrees
sphinx-build -b html -A mako_layout=html -d output/doctrees . output/html

According to the Sphinx documentation, nested lists must be separated from parent list items by blank lines. Here is an example from the Sphinx documentation:

```restructuredtext
* this is
* a list
  * with a nested list
  * and some subitems
* and here the parent list continues
```

I have attached a diff file (`sphinx-lists.diff`) to address these issues. However, I noticed that some `id` attribute values change as a result of the diff. As I am new to Sphinx, I am unsure if this matters. For instance:

```bash
(mydevenv)diana@diana-laptop:~/workspace/sqlalchemy/doc/build$ diff /home/diana/dbengine.html.before /home/diana/dbengine.html.after

Additionally, I would like to know if there are specific tests I should run for the documentation. I have already run `python setup.py test`, which resulted in:

```bash
Ran 2141 tests in 230.564s
OK
```

This is my first contribution to an open-source project, so please let me know if I am doing something incorrectly.
