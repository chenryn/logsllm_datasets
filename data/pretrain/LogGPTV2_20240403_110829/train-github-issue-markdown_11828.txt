When the Wi-Fi adapter on my laptop is disabled (e.g., in airplane mode), I am unable to debug an extension. The error message I receive is "Cannot connect to runtime process (reason: [object Object])". Additionally, the debugging window indicates that it cannot connect to the debugger.

It would be helpful if the debugging window provided a more descriptive error message instead of "[object Object]". Furthermore, logging this message in the debug console would improve the troubleshooting experience.

For reference, here is a screenshot of the issue:
