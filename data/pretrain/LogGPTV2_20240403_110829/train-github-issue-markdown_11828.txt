Debugging an extension does not work if the WiFi adapter is disabled on my
laptop. (i.e in airplane mode). I get the message "Cannot connect to runtime
process (reason: [object Object])", while the debug window said it could not
connect to the debugger.
Additionally it would be nice for the debugging window to give a better
message than [object Object], and for it to log the message in the debug
console.
