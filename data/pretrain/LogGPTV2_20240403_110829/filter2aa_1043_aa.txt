**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Over the next few years, consumers will spend billions of dollars on new digital receiving equipment, and the government will allocate $1.5 billion to subsidize digital-to-analog converter boxes. At a minimum, approximately 70 million television receivers that rely exclusively on over-the-air (OTA) reception will need to be replaced. Additionally, as the digital television (DTV) landscape evolves, new opportunities are emerging for OTA broadcasting, including mobile and portable devices and services, as well as advancements in transmission and distributed transmission systems.

All these investments, along with the billions spent by broadcasters to build the new DTV infrastructure, will be wasted if new DTV sets and other DTV products and services experience interference from so-called "low power" TV band devices. In the digital world, interference can render the picture unwatchable. The evidence presented in this proceeding, including research by the Canadian Research Centre Canada and other leading experts, demonstrates that the risk of co-channel, adjacent channel, out-of-band emissions, and other types of interference is significant. The existing Part 15 rules and the current proposals for TV band devices do not provide adequate protection against such interference.

Accordingly, the Association for Maximum Service Television, Inc. (MSTV) and the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) request the following:

- **No TV band devices should be permitted to operate before the DTV transition.**
- **Any operation of TV band devices should be limited to fixed operations only. Personal and portable operations should not be permitted.**
- **Protection of DTV operations should be based on Desired-to-Undesired (D/U) ratios.**
- **To avoid interference to TV viewers, all TV band devices must operate outside the protected contour on both co- and adjacent channels. Such devices should not operate inside a station's contour on either the co-channel or first adjacent channels.**
- **The sensing threshold proposed in the FNPRM does not provide adequate co-channel protection and misinterprets the IEEE approach.**
- **The proposed out-of-band emission limits (Part 15.209) are inadequate to protect DTV viewers and must be amended.**
- **The Commission must conduct testing to ensure that the final rules sufficiently protect television viewers and enact a rigorous enforcement program.**
- **Any new devices allowed to operate in the broadcast spectrum should be exclusively licensed; no unlicensed operation should be allowed.**

MSTV and NAB understand the need to provide additional wireless broadband opportunities, especially in rural areas. We agree that this goal can be achieved without endangering millions of TV viewers and consumers. However, the introduction of "low power" TV band devices, particularly personal and portable devices, into the television broadcast band is an unprecedented spectrum-sharing proposal that requires thorough testing. The protections adopted by the FCC should not threaten the success of the DTV transition. Only through such measures can the Commission guarantee that these devices do not harmfully interfere with existing licensed services in the band.

**I. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCEEDING, THE COMMISSION MUST UPHOLD ITS COMMITMENT TO THE DIGITAL TELEVISION TRANSITION**

The unprecedented spectrum-sharing proposal at issue in this proceeding, whereby "TV band devices" may be allowed to transmit alongside the nation's broadcast television service, poses a significant risk of interference to the viewing public. These devices, although characterized by the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM) as "low power," may operate at power levels as high as 4 Watts—a power level which, for purposes of evaluating potential interference to television receivers or licensed wireless microphones, is by no means "low." As the Commission considers adopting any rules authorizing such devices, it must be guided by its longstanding commitment to prevent interference to licensed services. Upholding that commitment to the viewing public has never been more important, as consumers are transitioning, en masse, to DTV.

In the span of the next two years, consumers will purchase billions of dollars worth of new DTV equipment to continue to receive their local television services. There are approximately 70 million television sets that rely exclusively on over-the-air transmissions and are not connected to cable or satellite services. The Commission must ensure that these millions of television viewers, who will have spent a significant amount of money to receive digital television signals, are not adversely impacted by any TV band devices that may operate within the broadcast spectrum. Now is a particularly sensitive time to allow the unprecedented sharing of spectrum among licensed television services and "low power" TV band devices.

The stakes in this proceeding are especially high given that interference concerns are even more pronounced in the DTV context. As MSTV and NAB have previously explained, DTV is an all-or-nothing technology; interference means not just a degraded picture, but no picture at all. If consumers are subjected to harmful interference from TV band devices, they will see a frozen picture or blank screen—in other words, a complete loss of over-the-air service.

Further, once these TV band devices are in the hands of consumers, the Commission will have no effective means of policing interference. While MSTV and NAB applaud the Commission's decision in the First Report and Order (First R&O) to keep TV band devices from operating in the broadcast spectrum until after the conclusion of the DTV transition, it is important to ensure that the public continues to experience the benefits of digital television technology well past the transition date of February 17, 2009. With all the public and private resources invested over the past two decades, including the $1.5 billion appropriated by Congress for digital-to-analog converter boxes, sacrificing the digital transition for speculative gains in unlicensed technologies would be a mistake. Years of hard work by broadcasters, government officials, consumer electronics manufacturers, and others have seen considerable progress. If TV band devices are allowed to interfere with digital television reception in 2009 or later, local consumers would lose out on the many public interest benefits of digital television, which the Commission has described to the public as "a new type of broadcasting technology that will transform television as we now know it."

The FNPRM focuses on the traditional television model of a large tower transmitting a signal to a stationary television and fails to consider how the introduction of TV band devices could stunt the future development and improvement of new DTV technologies. The Commission is already considering whether new technologies, such as Distributed Transmission Systems (DTS), could improve the quality of service to local communities. Similarly, the industry, through ATSC, has adopted one new broadcast standard and is in the process of evaluating additional standards to allow exciting new functionality, such as the broadcast of digital television signals to mobile and portable devices, including vehicular and pedestrian reception. These are merely the first in what will certainly be a series of new DTV technological advancements. Consequently, any rules the Commission creates to govern TV band devices must account for and protect these new, evolving digital broadcast technologies and services.

**II. CERTAIN MINIMUM PROTECTIONS MUST BE ADOPTED BEFORE ALLOWING TV BAND DEVICES TO OPERATE IN THE BROADCAST SPECTRUM**

While MSTV and NAB continue to have concerns about the Commission allowing any TV band devices to operate in the spectrum, at a minimum, the Commission must ensure that its final rules incorporate the following principles:

- **As the Commission has rightly decided, no TV band devices should be permitted to operate before the DTV transition.** The interference potential for TV band devices operating in the spectrum will be at its highest during the digital transition. If consumers experience interference prior to the DTV transition, this will severely disrupt the effectiveness of the transition. The Commission should not do anything to undermine this important transition and therefore must not waiver from its commitment to keep all new devices out of the spectrum at least until February 2009.
- **MSTV and NAB agree with the Commission that any operation of TV band devices should be limited to fixed operations only.** The Commission's cautious approach to permit only fixed low-power TV band devices to operate in the broadcast spectrum is certainly a proper course of action. Personal/portable devices should not be allowed to operate in the television band until further study and testing. Given the unprecedented interference potential of these low-power operations, it is important that the Commission first gain experience with the rules for fixed devices in this spectrum to ensure that those operations do not cause interference before allowing uncontrolled nomadic personal/portable devices to operate.
- **Protection of DTV operations should be based on Desired-to-Undesired (D/U) ratios.** In the initial Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the Commission correctly noted that "whether or not interference occurs depends on the desired to undesired signal ratio needed for acceptable service." Any rules adopted for TV band devices must assure that appropriate D/U ratios are maintained to ensure that interference is not caused to TV viewers throughout the TV station service area. Such ratios should apply to all new TV band device operations in the band. Indeed, as discussed more fully below, although additional testing conducted by Communications Research Centre Canada (CRC) on DTV receiver susceptibility generally supports use of those limits, it moreover suggests that interference protection considerations should also be given to second and third adjacent channels as well as to channels N+7, N+14, and N+15, and that further study on the impact of multiple interfering devices is needed.
- **To avoid interference to TV viewers, all TV band devices must operate outside the protected contour on both co- and adjacent channels.** To protect all TV viewers, including those who receive a weak but acceptable DTV signal, a TV band device cannot operate on a co- or adjacent channel within the protected contour of a television station. It should also be noted that a "weak" signal can be found anywhere within the TV service area, as occurs, for example, when the desired station's signal is blocked by terrain or buildings, or when the viewer uses an indoor antenna. Therefore, to ensure that harmful interference is not caused to television reception, any TV band device must be located outside the television station contour, at a sufficient distance such that the required D/U protection criteria are always met.
- **The sensing threshold proposed in the FNPRM does not provide adequate co-channel protection and misinterprets IEEE’s approach.** The sensing or detection threshold level should be a function of the interference potential of the TV band device and should ensure that the TV band device is far enough away not to cause interference to television reception. In proposing a level of -116 dBm, the FNPRM failed to provide any analysis on how that level would provide such protection to viewers, citing only that the level was supported by the working group of IEEE 802.22 Wireless Society (IEEE 802.22). In fact, the FNPRM's proposal misunderstands IEEE 802.22's important proposal, which protects licensed services by absolutely barring operation within the television station's protected contour. To prevent such operation, IEEE 802.22 would employ sensing in addition to geolocation—specifically, GPS and professional installation requirements that guarantee that the new device stays a sufficient distance outside the protected contour of a TV station's co- and adjacent channel. IEEE 802.22's use of a -116 dBm sensing level is merely one piece of the mechanism necessary to protect the viewing public, not the whole solution.
- **The proposed out-of-band emission limits are inadequate to protect DTV viewers and must be amended.** The current Section 15.209 limits, which define out-of-band emission limits for unlicensed devices, were adopted when unlicensed devices operated with narrowband emissions and operation in the TV band was prohibited. Testing conducted by CRC, and previously submitted by MSTV, has documented the fact that the existing Section 15.209 limits are inadequate to protect wideband DTV signals and TV viewers. Permitting emissions from TV band devices at these levels will interfere with digital television sets to such a degree that the television will go blank on all channels where such energy is present; such interference can occur at a distance of up to 78 feet from the "low power" device. Thus, as discussed more fully below in Section III, IEEE 802.22 and others have shown that the Section 15.209 limits must be reduced by 33 dB to avoid interference.
- **The Commission must conduct testing to ensure that the final rules sufficiently protect television viewers.** Just as theoretical interference models did not predict the interference between Commercial Mobile Radio Services (CMRS) and public safety communications systems in the 800 MHz band, they cannot reliably predict whether unlicensed devices would harm broadcast television reception. As MSTV and NAB have previously urged, the Commission should not allow new uses of the television broadcast spectrum without actual proof—in the form of detailed engineering studies and field tests—that such uses will preserve access to free, over-the-air television. To that end, any proposed "test devices" submitted to the Commission by third parties in support of proposals in this proceeding should be made available for inspection by the public. In addition, the Commission should publish its testing methodology far in advance of the actual testing to allow for public input and comment.
- **Any new devices allowed to operate in the broadcast spectrum should be exclusively licensed; no unlicensed operation should be allowed.** As compared to an "unlicensed" device regime, a licensed system provides more reliable protection to users of existing services, leads to more efficient use of the broadcast spectrum, and reaps significant economic benefits for the American taxpayer. Providing for licensed use of any "white spaces" in the broadcast spectrum is particularly appropriate given the vast amounts of unlicensed spectrum in other bands that the Commission has made available in recent years.
- **The Commission must enact a rigorous enforcement program.** If the Commission allows TV band devices to operate in the spectrum, it must develop a reliable system to enforce the prohibition on these devices interfering with licensed services. Without such enforcement mechanisms, the rules prohibiting interference with incumbent services will be ineffective.

**III. THE INTERFERENCE HARMS POSED BY TV BAND DEVICES ARE NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED IN THE FNPRM**

In designing rules to safeguard the viewing public's access to digital television, it is important to recognize that interference from TV band devices will be caused not at the point of transmission (i.e., the television tower), but rather at the point of reception (i.e., the television set in a family's living room, kitchen, bedroom, basement, or elsewhere). Television sets are scattered throughout a television station's service area, and whenever any device is in proximity to any television receiver, the risk of interference will increase. As discussed below, the FNPRM would leave millions of viewers unprotected from such interference.

Specifically, there are four types of interference that TV band devices can cause to DTV receivers: (1) co-channel interference; (2) adjacent channel interference; (3) interference from taboo channels and unwanted intermodulation products; and (4) out-of-band interference. New testing by the CRC suggests that interference can also occur to DTV receivers on second and third adjacent channels and on channels N+7, N+14, and N+15. The CRC testing also provides evidence that the performance of a DTV receiver can be adversely affected by the presence of multiple interfering signals causing unwanted intermodulation products and interference. A more detailed description of these types of interference is presented in the paper at Exhibit A, prepared by Robert Eckert.

The Commission is required to protect incumbent services from all types of interference, but upholding this requirement is particularly challenging in the context of the unprecedented spectrum-sharing proposal at issue in this proceeding. To date, the type of "low power" devices (i.e., unlicensed devices) proposed have been allowed to operate only in bands with little or no licensed, communications services. By introducing such devices into spectrum already used to deliver the public's free, over-the-air television service, the risks from all types of interference become quite significant, but the FNPRM falls far short of addressing those risks.

**A. Any Operation by a TV Band Device on a Co-Channel Basis Will Cause Interference for Miles**

Unless rules adopted in this proceeding reliably prevent TV band devices from operating on the same channel (i.e., co-channel) as local television stations, consumers' sets will experience severe and incurable interference. Such interference will disable a consumer's ability to receive the co-channel television station for up to tens of miles, depending on the power and antenna height of the TV band device.

The severe effects of such co-channel interference are verified by an analysis of data submitted previously by Intel, despite its support of an aggressive "unlicensed devices" regime. Specifically, in its comments to the Commission, Intel suggested that the interference range of a 100 mW personal/portable unlicensed device is approximately 8 kilometers (or 5 miles) from a television contour, thereby acknowledging that, to not cause interference to TV reception, any TV band device must operate at a sufficiently large distance away from the television contour. In fact, the actual zone of interference would be much larger, as Intel's analysis incorrectly assumes a 14 dB antenna discrimination factor. In any event, even the parties with the least incentive to protect television viewership, such as Intel, acknowledge that TV band device operation on a co-channel can cause significant interference to television viewers over a large area.

**B. The Current Sensing Proposals Are Inadequate to Protect Against Co-Channel Interference**

Despite the acknowledged effects of co-channel interference on television receivers, the FNPRM would allow such interference to occur. The FNPRM's proposal to control for such interference by having devices "sense" the presence of a co-channel television signal (and then cease operating if a television signal of a certain level is sensed) falls far short of the protections necessary to protect the viewing public.

**1. The Proposal of a -116 dBm Sensing Level Is Insufficient to Protect Incumbent Services**

The -116 dBm sensing level proposed in the FNPRM will fail to adequately protect licensed television services. At a minimum, a sensing detection level must ensure that a TV band device is a sufficient distance outside the protected contour of the TV station to prevent interference, but the level proposed would often allow operation within the protected contour. Indeed, the proposed sensing level for a device that can operate with up to 4 Watts is higher (i.e., less strict) than the level proposed by Intel for even a 100 milliwatt device, which itself was insufficient. As discussed below, a sensing threshold set at the level proposed would do little to protect the viewing public from harmful co-channel interference.

Both the previous Intel and the current FNPRM sensing proposals fail to recognize that TV signal levels are not uniformly distributed throughout a station's service area; consequently, there are locations where television receivers may not receive a television signal that is adequate for viewing. The current sensing proposals, however, would allow a device to transmit on a co-channel basis, inside the TV contour, despite the fact that interference could be caused to TV viewers for miles. That is, the sensing proposals operate under the false presumption that if the television signal is weak (i.e., below the proposed detection threshold), then the TV band device can safely operate. This assumption is flawed and will lead to significant interference.

**2. The Comparison of the Use of Spectrum Sensing in the 5 GHz Band with the Current Situation Is Misplaced**

The FNPRM's reliance on the 5 GHz band as a precedent for spectrum sensing is misplaced. The 5 GHz band is fundamentally different from the TV broadcast bands in terms of the nature of the services, the power levels, and the interference characteristics. The 5 GHz band is used primarily for unlicensed Wi-Fi and other short-range, low-power applications, whereas the TV broadcast bands are used for long-range, high-power, and highly sensitive DTV transmissions. The interference mechanisms and the consequences of interference are vastly different, making the 5 GHz band an inappropriate analogy for the TV broadcast bands.
