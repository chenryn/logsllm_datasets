EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Over the next few years, consumers will spend billions of dollars in new digital receiving 
equipment, and the government will spend 1.5 billion dollars on a subsidy to fund digital to 
analog converter boxes.  At a minimum, consumers will be replacing approximately 70 million 
television receivers that rely exclusively on over the air television reception.   In addition, as the 
digital television world unfolds, new opportunities are emerging for over-the-air television 
broadcasting.  New over-the-air mobile and portable devices and services are being developed.
Advancements in transmission and distributed transmission systems are on the horizon. All of 
these investments, as well as the billions spent by broadcasters building the new digital television 
infrastructure, will be wasted if new DTV sets and other new DTV products and services receive 
interference from so called, “low power” TV band devices.  In the digital world, interference 
causes the picture to become unwatchable. 
  The evidence presented in this proceeding, including research by the Canadian Research 
Centre Canada, as well as other leading experts demonstrate that the risk of co-channel, adjacent 
channel, out of band emission and other types of interference is significant.  The existing Part 15 
rules and the TV band device proposals to date will not protect consumers from interference.   
Accordingly, the Association for Maximum Service Television, Inc. (“MSTV”) and the 
National Association of Broadcasters (“NAB”) hereby request the following:
•
As the Commission has rightly decided, no TV band devices should be permitted 
to operate before the DTV transition.  
.
•
As the Commission tentatively concluded, any operation of TV band devices 
should be limited to fixed operations only. Personal and portable operations 
should not be permitted.     
•
Protection of DTV operations should be based on Desired-to-Undesired (D/U) 
ratios.
iii
•
To avoid interference to TV viewers, all TV band devices must operate outside 
the protected contour on both co- and adjacent channels.  Such devices should 
not operate inside a stations contour on either the co-channel or first adjacent 
channels.
•
The sensing threshold proposed in the FNPRM does not provide adequate co-
channel protection and misinterprets IEEE approach
•
The proposed out-of-band emission limits (Part 15.209) are inadequate to 
protect DTV viewers and must be amended. 
•
The Commission must conduct testing to ensure that the final rules sufficiently 
protect television viewers.  The Commission must enact a rigorous enforcement 
program
•
Any new devices allowed to operate in the broadcast spectrum should be 
exclusively licensed; no unlicensed operation should be allowed.
MSTV and NAB understand the need to provide the opportunity for additional wireless 
broadband opportunities, especially in rural areas.  We agree this goal can be accomplished 
without endangering millions of TV viewers and consumers.  Nonetheless, the introduction of 
“low power” TV band devices, especially personal and portable devices, in the television 
broadcast band is an unprecedented spectrum sharing proposal which needs to be accompanied 
by proper testing. The protections adopted by the FCC should not threaten the success of the 
DTV transition.  Only this way can the Commission guarantee that such devices do not 
harmfully interfere with existing licensed services in the band.

JOINT COMMENTS OF
THE ASSOCIATION FOR MAXIMUM SERVICE TELEVISION, INC.,
AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTERS
The Association for Maximum Service Television, Inc. (“MSTV”)1 and the 
National Association of Broadcasters (“NAB”)2 file these comments in response to the 
Commission’s First Report and Order and Notice of Further Proposed Rulemaking (“First R&O 
and FNPRM”).  As discussed below, in order to avoid undoing the decades-long efforts at 
bringing the benefits of digital television (“DTV”) to the American public, the regime under 
which any new devices are allowed into the broadcast spectrum must protect existing and future 
television and related licensed services from interference.3  Any decision to permit new so-called

and TV translator stations to provide traditional local broadcast television services to the public. 
There are approximately 1,750 full service analog and digital television stations, over 500 class 
A stations, nearly 2,300 low power stations, and approximately 4,500 translator and booster 
stations. See Broadcast Station Totals as of December 31, 2006, News Release (rel. Jan. 26, 
2007), available at http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-269784A1.doc (last

“TV band” devices must ensure that existing licensed operations are fully protected and the 
ability of TV broadcasters and other licensees to improve their operations and offer new services 
is not impeded.4    
I.
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCEEDING THE COMMISSION MUST UPHOLD ITS 
COMMITMENT TO THE DIGITAL TELEVISION TRANSITION.   
The unprecedented spectrum sharing proposal at issue in this proceeding, whereby “TV 
band devices” may be allowed to transmit alongside the nation’s broadcast television service, 
poses a significant risk of interference to the viewing public.  These devices, although 
characterized by the FNPRM as “low power,” may operate at power levels as high as 4 Watts – a 
power level which, for purposes of evaluating potential interference to television receivers or 
licensed wireless microphones, is by no means “low”.5  As the Commission considers adopting 
any rules authorizing such devices, it must be guided by its longstanding commitment to prevent 
interference to licensed services.6
Upholding that commitment to the viewing public has never been more important, as 
consumers are transitioning, en masse, to DTV.  In the span of the next two years, consumers  
as wireless microphones used in program production and Electronic News Gathering (“ENG”).
In the future, DTV promises to bring exciting new services to the American consumer, such as 
multiple high definition programming and mobile and portable television services.   
4 These comments use the term “TV band devices” to describe devices that may be allowed to 
operate in the television spectrum as a result of this proceeding. In this proceeding, the 
Commission has suggested that such devices could operate anywhere from 100 mW to 4 W.     
5 The Commission has proposed that TV band devices may operate at up to 4 Watts.  This is 
considerably more, for example, than licensed wireless microphones, which may only operate 
with up to 250 mW under Part 74 of the rules.  See 47 C.F.R. §74.861.  It is also a much higher 
power level than other unlicensed devices, such as Broadband over Powerline (“BPL”) devices, 
which are only permitted to operate at approximately .000000027 Watts using the suggested 
calculation contained in OET Bulletin No. 63 to convert 90 microvolts/meter field strength to 
power. See 47 C.F.R. §15.109.

will purchase billions of dollars of new DTV equipment to continue to receive their local 
television services.7  There are approximately 70 million television sets that rely exclusively on 
over-the-air transmissions and are not connected to cable or satellite services.8  The Commission 
must make certain that these millions of television viewers, who will have spent a significant 
amount of money to receive digital television signals, are not adversely impacted by any TV 
band devices that may operate within the broadcast spectrum.  Now is a particularly sensitive 
time in which to allow the unprecedented sharing of spectrum among licensed television services 
and “low power” TV band devices.
The stakes in this proceeding are especially high given that interference concerns are 
even more pronounced in the DTV context.  As MSTV and NAB have previously explained, 
DTV is an all-or-nothing technology; interference means not just a degraded picture, but no 
picture at all.9  If consumers are subjected to harmful interference from TV band devices, they 
will see a frozen picture or blank screen – in other words, a complete loss of over-the-air service.  
7 In addition, the Commission must keep in mind the billions of dollars that broadcasters have 
and will have invested to build out their stations and infrastructure to bring DTV service to the 
public.
8 Most significantly affected will be the 20 million households who rely solely on broadcasters’ 
over-the-air signals.  The Commission must not lose sight, however, of its obligation to protect 
the millions of cable and satellite households with one or more television sets that are not 
connected to the pay service.  See Comments of NAB and MSTV, MB Docket No. 04-210 (filed 
Aug. 11, 2004); Comments of the Association of Public Television Stations, MB Docket No. 04-
210  (filed Aug. 11, 2004) at 10 (estimating 34.5 million over-the-air sets in homes that also 
subscribe to cable or satellite); Comments of the Consumer Electronics Association, MB Docket 
No. 04-210 (filed Aug. 11, 2004) at 4 (“[E]ven in cable and/or satellite households, not every 
television in the household may be connected to these services.  This reflects the household’s 
conscious decision whether or not to connect”); Comments of Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.,

respondents [to a survey conducted by Sinclair] live in households with at least one television 
that is used exclusively for free, over-the-air analog reception.).

Further, as discussed below, once these TV band devices are in the hands of consumers, the 
Commission will have no effective means of policing interference.    
While MSTV and NAB applaud the Commission’s decision in the First R&O to keep TV 
band devices from operating in the broadcast spectrum until after the conclusion of the DTV 
transition, it is important to ensure that the public continues to experience the benefits of digital 
television technology well past the transition date of February 17, 2009.10  With all the public 
and private resources invested over the past two decades, including the $1.5 billion appropriated 
by Congress for digital-to-analog converter boxes,11 sacrificing the digital transition for 
speculative gains in unlicensed technologies would be a mistake.  Years of hard work by 
broadcasters, government officials, consumer electronics manufacturers, and others have seen 
considerable progress.  If TV band devices are allowed to interfere with digital television 
reception in 2009 or later, local consumers would lose out on the many public interest benefits of 
digital television, which the Commission has described to the public as “a new type of 
broadcasting technology that will transform television as we now know it.”12
The FNPRM focuses on the traditional television model of a large tower transmitting a 
signal to a stationary television and fails to consider how the introduction of TV band devices 
could stunt the future development and improvement of new DTV technologies. The 
10 That is, although the public may awake to excellent DTV reception in early 2009, if interfering 
devices are introduced into the spectrum, over time (and perhaps quite quickly) the ability of 
broadcasters to provide the public with the benefits of DTV, and improved coverage and 
reliability of that reception, will decline.  Without carefully crafted interference protections, 
within just a few years or even months of the transition date, viewers experiencing seemingly 
inexplicable interference could begin returning newly acquired digital equipment and 
government-subsidized converter boxes.

Commission is already considering, however, whether new technologies, such as Distributed 
Transmission Systems (“DTS”),13 could improve the quality of service to local communities.  
Similarly, the industry, through ATSC,  has adopted one new broadcast standard, and is in the 
process of evaluating additional standards to allow exciting new functionality, such as the 
broadcast of digital television signals to mobile and portable devices, including vehicular and 
pedestrian reception.14  These are merely the first in what will certainly be a series of new DTV 
technological advancements.15  Consequently, any rules the Commission creates to govern TV 
band devices must account for, and protect, these new evolving digital broadcast technologies 
and services.16
II.
CERTAIN MINIMUM PROTECTIONS MUST BE ADOPTED BEFORE 
ALLOWING TV BAND DEVICES TO OPERATE IN THE BROADCAST 
SPECTRUM.
While MSTV and NAB continue to have concerns about the Commission allowing any
TV band devices to operate in the spectrum, at a minimum, the Commission must ensure that its 
final rules incorporate the following principles:  
•
As the Commission has rightly decided, no TV band devices should be permitted 
to operate before the DTV transition.  The interference potential for TV band 
devices operating in the spectrum will be at its highest during the digital 
transition.  If consumers experience interference prior to the DTV transition, this 
will severely disrupt the effectiveness of the transition.  The Commission should 
not do anything to undermine this important transition and therefore must not

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 20 FCC Rcd. 17797 (2005). 
14 Mark Richer, Making DTV The Best That It Can Be, TVNewsday, Jan. 25, 2007. 
15 For example, numerous devices are now available that permit the reception of DTV signals on 
laptop and personal computers.
16 The Commission must also ensure that any new rules adopted in this proceeding do not inhibit 
the creation and protection of 175 new DTV allotments, as provided for in the Community 
Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999. See Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, Pub. 
L. No. 106-113, § 1000(a)(9), 113 Stat. 1536 (1999). 
Comments of MSTV and NAB

waiver from its commitment to keep all new devices out of the spectrum at least 
until February 2009. 
•
MSTV and NAB agree with the Commission that any operation of TV band 
devices should be limited to fixed operations only. The Commission’s cautious 
approach to permit only fixed low power TV band devices to operate in the 
broadcast spectrum is certainly a proper course of action.  Personal/portable 
devices should not be allowed to operate in the television band until further study 
and testing.  Given the unprecedented interference potential of these low power 
operations, it is important that the Commission first gain experience with the rules 
for fixed devices in this spectrum to ensure that those operations do not cause 
interference before allowing uncontrolled nomadic personal/portable devices to 
operate.     
•
Protection of DTV operations should be based on Desired-to-Undesired (D/U) 
ratios. In the initial Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”), the Commission 
correctly noted that “whether or not interference occurs depends on the desired to 
undesired signal ratio needed for acceptable service.”17  Any rules adopted for TV 
band devices must assure that appropriate D/U ratios are maintained to ensure that 
interference is not caused to TV viewers throughout the TV station service area.
Such ratios should apply to all new TV band device operations in the band.
Indeed, as discussed more fully below, although additional testing conducted by 
Communications Research Centre Canada (“CRC”) on DTV receiver 
susceptibility generally supports use of those limits, it moreover suggests that 
interference protection considerations should also be given to second and third 
adjacent channels as well as to channels N+7, N+14 and N+15 and that further 
study on the impact of multiple interfering devices is needed. 
•
To avoid interference to TV viewers, all TV band devices must operate outside 
the protected contour on both co- and adjacent channels.  To protect all TV 
viewers including those that receive a weak but acceptable DTV signal, a TV 
band device cannot operate on a co- or adjacent channel within the protected 
contour of a television station.18   It should also be noted that a “weak” signal can 
be found anywhere within the TV service area, as occurs, for example, when the 
desired station’s signal is blocked by terrain or buildings, or when the viewer uses 
an indoor antenna.  Therefore, to ensure that the harmful interference is not 
caused to television reception, any TV band device must be located outside the 
television station contour, at a sufficient distance such that the required D/U 
protection criteria are always met.  
•
The sensing threshold proposed in the FNPRM does not provide adequate co-
channel protection and misinterprets IEEE’s approach.  The sensing or

18 Considering that a desired DTV signal of -83 dBm and above will produce a perfect picture 
and sound, and the D/U ratios which are necessary to protect television reception, TV band 
devices must operate outside the protected contour.
Comments of MSTV and NAB 
Jan. 31, 2007 
ET Docket Nos. 02-380 and 04-186 
Page 7 of 40 
detection threshold level should be a function of the interference potential of the 
TV band device and should ensure that the TV band device is far enough away 
not to cause interference to television reception.  In proposing a level of -116 
dBm, the FNPRM failed to provide any analysis on how that level would provide 
such protection to viewers, citing only that the level was supported by the 
working group of IEEE 802.22 Wireless Society (“IEEE 802.22”).  In fact, the 
FNPRM’s proposal misunderstands IEEE 802.22’s important proposal, which 
protects licensed services by absolutely barring operation within the television 
station’s protected contour.  To prevent such operation, IEEE 802.22 would 
employ sensing in addition to geolocation – specifically, GPS and professional 
installation requirements that guarantee that the new device stays a sufficient 
distance outside the protected contour of a TV station’s co- and adjacent channel.  
IEEE 802.22’s use of a -116 dBm sensing level is merely one piece of the 
mechanism necessary to protect the viewing public, not the whole solution.
•
The proposed out-of-band emission limits are inadequate to protect DTV 
viewers and must be amended. The current Section 15.209 limits, which define 
out-of-band emission limits for unlicensed devices, were adopted when 
unlicensed devices operated with narrow band emissions and operation in the TV 
band was prohibited.  Testing conducted by CRC, and previously submitted by 
MSTV, has documented the fact that the existing Section 15.209 limits are 
inadequate to protect wideband DTV signals and TV viewers.19  Permitting 
emissions from TV band devices at these levels will interfere with digital 
television sets to such a degree that the television will go blank on all channels 
where such energy is present; such interference can occur at a distance of up to 78 
feet from the “low power” device.  Thus, as discussed more fully below in Section 
III, IEEE 802.22 and others have shown that the Section 15.209 limits must be 
reduced by 33 dB to avoid interference. 
•
The Commission must conduct testing to ensure that the final rules sufficiently 
protect television viewers. Just as theoretical interference models did not predict 
the interference between CMRS and public safety communications systems in the 
800 MHz band,20 they cannot reliably predict whether unlicensed devices would 
harm broadcast television reception.  As MSTV and NAB have previously urged, 
the Commission should not allow new uses of the television broadcast spectrum 
without actual proof – in the form of detailed engineering studies and field tests – 
that such uses will preserve access to free, over-the-air television.  To that end, 
any proposed “test devices” submitted to the Commission by third parties in 
support of proposals in this proceeding should be made available for inspection by

13 (2004) (“Despite the claims by some that licensees in the cellular telephone bands cause little 
interference to 800 MHz band public safety systems, strong evidence exists to the contrary”).

the public.21 In addition, the Commission should publish its testing methodology 
far in advance of the actual testing to allow for public input and comment.  
•
Any new devices allowed to operate in the broadcast spectrum should be 
exclusively licensed; no unlicensed operation should be allowed. As compared 
to an “unlicensed” device regime, a licensed system provides more reliable 
protection to users of existing services, leads to more efficient use of the 
broadcast spectrum, and reaps significant economic benefits for the American 
taxpayer.  Providing for licensed use of any “white spaces” in the broadcast 
spectrum is particularly appropriate given the vast amounts of unlicensed 
spectrum in other bands that the Commission has made available in recent years. 
•
The Commission must enact a rigorous enforcement program. If the 
Commission allows TV band devices to operate in the spectrum, it must develop a 
reliable system to enforce the prohibition on these devices interfering with 
licensed services.  Without such enforcement mechanisms, the rules prohibiting 
interference with incumbent services will be ineffective.
III.
THE INTERFERENCE HARMS POSED BY TV BAND DEVICES ARE NOT 
ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED IN THE FNPRM.  
In designing rules to safeguard the viewing public’s access to digital television, it is 
important to recognize that interference from TV band devices will be caused not at the point of 
transmission (i.e., the television tower), but rather at the point of reception (i.e., the television set 
in a family’s living room, kitchen, bedroom, basement, or elsewhere).  Television sets are 
scattered through a television station’s service area, and whenever any device is in proximity to 
any television receiver the risk of interference will increase.  As discussed below, the FNPRM 
would leave millions of viewers unprotected from such interference.
Specifically, there are four types of interference TV band devices cause to DTV 
receivers: (1) co-channel interference; (2) adjacent channel interference; 22 (3) interference from 
21 See Office of Engineering and Technology Invites Submittal of Prototype TV Band Devices 
For Testing, DA 06-2571 (rel. Dec. 21, 2006).
22 MSTV and NAB generally support the co-channel and adjacent channel D/U protection ratios 
proposed in the initial NPRM but these protections must apply to all TV band operations, 
including personal/portable devices. Recent testing by the CRC supports the proposed D/U ratios 
for DTV of -26 dB for upper adjacent channel operations, and -28 dB for lower adjacent channel 
Comments of MSTV and NAB 
Jan. 31, 2007 
ET Docket Nos. 02-380 and 04-186 
Page 9 of 40 
taboo channels and unwanted intermodulation products; and (4) out-of-band interference.  New 
testing by the CRC suggests that interference can also occur to DTV receivers on second and 
third adjacent channels and on channels N+7, N+14 and N+15.  The CRC testing also provides 
evidence that the performance of a DTV receiver can be adversely affected by the presence of 
multiple interfering signals causing unwanted intermodulation products and interference.  A 
more detailed description of these types of interference is presented in the paper at Exhibit A, 
prepared by Robert Eckert.
The Commission is required to protect incumbent services from all types of 
interference,23 but upholding this requirement is particularly challenging in the context of the 
unprecedented spectrum-sharing proposal at issue in this proceeding.  To date, the type of “low 
power” devices (i.e., unlicensed devices) proposed have been allowed to operate only in bands 
with little or no licensed, communications services.  By introducing such devices into spectrum 
already used to deliver the public’s free, over-the-air television service, the risks from all types 
of interference become quite significant, but the FNPRM falls far short of addressing those risks.  
A.
Any Operation By A TV Band Device On A Co-Channel Basis Will Cause 
Interference For Miles. 
Unless rules adopted in this proceeding reliably prevent TV band devices from operating 
on the same channel (i.e., co-channel) as local television stations, consumers’ sets will 
experience severe and incurable interference.  Such interference will disable a consumer’s ability 
operations.  These values will ensure that DTV operations are provided adequate protection on 
co- and adjacent channels taking into account the fact that TV band devices may operate with 
different modulation schemes and multiple TV band devices may be present.  These values will 
also ensure that TV band devices provide at least the same level of protection as TV licensees 
receive from other licensed operations.   However, based on testing by CRC, D/U ratios for other 
channels should also be developed to ensure protection of TV viewers as discussed in Section III 
E, herein.

to receive the co-channel television station for up to tens of miles depending on the power and 
antenna height of the TV band device.
The severe effects of such co-channel interference are verified by an analysis of data 
submitted previously by Intel, despite its support of an aggressive “unlicensed devices” regime.  
Specifically, in its comments to the Commission, Intel suggested that the interference range of a 
100 mW personal/portable unlicensed device is approximately 8 kilometers (or 5 miles) from a 
television contour, therefore acknowledging that in order not to cause interference to TV 
reception, any TV band device must operate at a sufficiently large distance away from the 
television contour.24  In fact, the actual zone of interference would be much larger, as Intel’s 
analysis incorrectly assumes a 14 dB antenna discrimination factor.25  In any event, even the 
parties with least incentive to protect television viewership, such as Intel, acknowledge that TV 
band device operation on a co-channel can cause significant interference to television viewers 
over a large area.
B.
The Current Sensing Proposals Are Inadequate To Protect Against Co-
Channel Interference. 
Despite the acknowledged effects of co-channel interference on television receivers, the 
FNPRM would allow such interference to occur.  The FNPRM’s proposal to control for such 
24 See Comments of Intel Corp, ET Docket No. 04-186 (filed Nov. 30, 2004) (“Intel Comments”) 
at App. A.  This calculation is based on an 8 km or 5 mile radius.  In some cases, since television 
receivers can be located in front of a TV band device, the 14 dB antenna discrimination would 
not apply and the actual calculated interference area would be much larger.  Moreover. This is 
based on a 100 mW device.  In this proceeding, however, the FCC has contemplated power 
levels of up to 4 watts.
25 Intel assumes that the TV band device will always be located a sufficient distance from the TV 
station contour such that any emissions from the TV band device will be into the “back” of the 
TV antenna and the front-to-back discrimination of the TV antenna can be taken into account.
Intel also assumes the TV antenna and TV band device are at different heights such that there is a 
“slant angle” to the TV receiving antenna.  The -118 dBm sensing level proposed by Intel would 
actually allow the TV band device to be located inside the TV station contour in some instances 
where the use of these antenna discrimination factors would not apply.

interference by having devices “sense” the presence of a co-channel television signal (and then 
cease operating if a television signal of a certain level is sensed) falls far short of protections 
necessary to protect the viewing public.
1.
The Proposal Of A -116 dBm Sensing Level Is Insufficient To Protect 
Incumbent Services. 
The -116 dBm sensing level proposed in the FNPRM will fail to adequately protect 
licensed television services.26  At a minimum, a sensing detection level must ensure that a TV 
band device is a sufficient distance outside the protected contour of the TV station to prevent 
interference, but the level proposed would often allow operation within the protected contour.
Indeed, the proposed sensing level for a device that can operate with up to 4 Watts is higher (i.e.,
less strict) than the level proposed by Intel for even a 100 milliwatt device, which itself was 
insufficient.27  As discussed below, a sensing threshold set at the level proposed would do little 
to protect the viewing public from harmful co-channel interference.  
26 See Unlicensed Operation in the TV Broadcast Bands, First Report and Order and Further 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, ET Docket No. 04-186, FCC 06-156 (rel. Oct. 18, 2006) (“First 
R&O and FNPRM”) at App. B, §15.707(f).  The Commission also did not define over what 
bandwidth this threshold detection value is to be measured other than to suggest that detection is 
“within the TV band device channel bandwidth.”  The specification of a measurement bandwidth 
is important since it can have a significant impact on the detection level.  For example, there is a 
27 dB difference between signals of -116 dBm if they are measured using a 6 MHz bandwidth or 
a 10 kHz bandwidth.  Therefore, it is essential to also specify the bandwidth for the detection 
threshold level.   Since TV operations use a 6 MHz channel, we recommend that any detection 
threshold level used for protection of TV operations be specified over 6 MHz bandwidths so as 
to match the TV channels identified in Section 73.602 of the Commission’s rules.  If smaller 
bandwidths are permitted, the threshold level must be lowered to take into account the reduced 
energy of the TV signal being measured in the smaller bandwidth.      
27 See Intel Comments.  Intel’s interference analysis is predicated on the assumption that a –85 
dBm signal level will always be at least 8 kilometers beyond the Grade B contour and therefore 
one can reduce the interfering signal of the unlicensed device by a factor of 20 dB or 100 times.  
In fact, DTV signals at levels at or below –85 dBm can and do occur within the DTV service 
area where this reduction is not appropriate and the unlicensed device would cause additional 
significant interference to DTV viewers.  The detection level suggested by Intel also fails to take 
account of signal variability, which necessitates a lower (i.e., stricter) detection threshold.

Both the previous Intel and the current FNRPM sensing proposals fail to recognize that 
TV signal levels are not uniformly distributed throughout a station’s service area; consequently, 
there are locations where television receivers may not receive a television signal that is adequate 
for viewing.28  The current sensing proposals, however, would allow a device to transmit on a 
co-channel basis, inside the TV contour, despite the fact that interference could be caused to TV 
viewers for miles.  That is, the sensing proposals operate under the false presumption that if the 
television signal is weak (i.e., below the proposed detection threshold), then the TV band device
