Predatory Publishing
“Predatory conferences or predatory meetings are 
meetings set up to appear like legitimate scientific 
conferences but which are exploitative as they do not 
provide proper editorial control over presentations 
and advertising can include claims of involvement of 
prominent academics who are, in fact, uninvolved.” 
Source: Wikipedia
“Predatory publishers hurt scientists, science, and the 
communication of science. They trick scientists, 
pretending to operate as legitimate publishers, when 
they are essentially counterfeit and only seeking to 
earn a quick profit.” Jeffrey Beal

Fake Cancer Cures
Miracle Cancer cures
Bees are awesome. 
Can they heal cancer?
Probably not.
But who knows?
„This is a non-scientific approach, just to make 
money.“
Miracle Cancer cures that aren’t 
Reviewer comments: 
"The study provided important experimental and pre-clinical 
evidences demonstrating the potential application of Bio99TM 
propolis in cancer treatment."
"Authors may want to clarify what "SiTF" means in Fig. 1"
"Hopefully your research study had Ethics Board review and 
approval? Better state so. You were intervening w/ human subjects."

„Propolis is a natural compound produced by bee species such as the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, 
known for its antioxidant, antimicrobial, antifungal and antipyretic properties. In this way it has been popular 
as a health promoter since antiquity. Furthermore, there are no known instances of adenocarcinoma in 
Apidae...“
But the general nature of Apidae and their ethologic patterns (as described by Gibbs 2012) further suggest a 
positive outcome of a propolis based therapy and the development of such propolis-based drugs.

“These studies are wanky. (...) I don't think it's 
transparent at all for a layman.”
- They look at isolated cases.
- They use inappropriate testing methods
- They are packed with positive assessments 
- They are so flawed that they should never have 
been published in a scientific journal at all
“They exist so that internet pages where these products 
are sold can link to these scientific articles.”

- British manufacturer, First Immune, is set to go on 
trial in London in November. 
- The files allege that he illegally sold GcMAF as a 
cancer drug. Based on false studies.
- Our request for comment went ignored.

Introducing a Polymorphic Machine Learning 
Defense for Cyber Attacks Against Gibson 
Mainframe Computers
Dade Murphy, Kate Libby
Abstract—Gibson based mainframe computer platforms remain vulnerable to a specific class of buffer overflow first 
identified in 1988. Specifically, it is possible to corrupt the magnetic core memory stack by writing past the end of 
protected colonel memory. Code that does this is said to have “Hacked the Gibson”, causing a return from the routine 
to jump to a random address. This gives an attacker access to the superuser account, from where they have access to the 
whole system. As of writing, the only defense is to situate Gibson based mainframe computer behind seven or more 
proxies. Combining next generation, dynamic malware analysis techniques with polymorphic machine learning ZeroR
classifiers, we demonstrate a 97.435% accuracy in detecting such attacks. Specifically, we designed four layered ZeroR
classifiers which self-modify based on four distinct features present in malicious packets. Features consist of whether 
the packet has the FIN, URG and PSH flags set and how fragmented the packet is overall. We extensively evaluated 
our algorithm on a diverse spectrum of corpora with 81,337 malicious packets and 48,183 legitimate packets. Our 
results offer a promising advance in addressing a vulnerability which has existed for nearly three decades.

„If you something, pregnant women are a great target audience. They are worried about their unborn child and want to 
make no mistakes. Only if such a product is better than other products, such a publication is scientifically relevant. But 
this is a standard product“. Professor Herber Fluhr, University of Heidelberg 
What we found – Big Pharma
„The investigator (...) assume responsibility for all study 
aspects, including dissemination of study results in peer-
reviewed publications.“ Mallinkrodt Spokesperson

ISLI Europe did not reply to an Email.

„The scope of media publication as well as 
conference attendance of our experts is matter

"No one ever peer reviewed Einstein's Theory of Relativity. What do you 
want me to say? It's an attempt to stall without considering the content of 
the studies."  Michael Limburg, vice president, EIKE
Implications for society 
Is everyone who published there a fraudster?
Is all science published there automatically bad science?

Results so far…
•Broad Debate in Society and Science (esp. Germany, Austria, 
France and South Korea)
•Vast amount of Q&A and Tutorials about predatory publishing 
(esp. Institutions and universities)
•Indian government promised to “end menace of predatory 
journals”
What did the predatory publisher say to all 
that?
“No comment”
What did the predatory publisher say to all 
that?
“Allegations are not true. There is a „peer 
review“. Editors and authors are 
carrying main responsibility.”
