Table 6: Destinations of the reshipped packages. Moscow and its
suburbs account for a clear majority of the packages ﬁnal destination
regardless of the reshipping site and the items it targets. At least 85%
of all packages are being reshipped to Moscow.
5.4.2 Label Purchases
Similar to analyzing access patterns to identify suspicious packages,
one can track who purchases package labels and through which chan-
nels. The prepaid labels are being used when the drops mail the package
to the stuffer (see Figure 1, ) and, therefore, the corresponding ship-
ments constitute the last chance to intervene before the merchandise
reaches the stuffer and the damage is irreversible. For instance, to iden-
tify a suspicious package, one can analyze the buyer of a package label,
the extent to which a single account pays for multiple different labels
(e.g., “white label” services), or if packages always go to the same desti-
nation but are being shipped by different senders, e.g., by identifying if
a label provider acts as a hub in the scheme. Based on this information,
a risk score can be assigned to each label service who sold the label and
for each individual purchased label. This risk score then captures how
likely it is that the package contains goods paid for through illicit means,
allowing to selectively delay it, and aiding in discovery and recovery.
5.4.3 Reshipping Destinations
The ﬁnal destinations of the packages that are reshipped are usually
overseas (e.g., in Russia). A stuffer is more likely to use addresses
within a small area for his packages that is under his control so that
he can retrieve it without any issues. Although it is often impossible to
apprehend criminals who are abroad, the patterns of reshipping desti-
nations can help to intercept the international shipping packages before
they leave the country, e.g., at an USPS International Service Center.
To better understand the distribution of the ﬁnal destinations, we use
OCR techniques to extract the recipient addresses in the “To” ﬁelds
from the electronic shipping labels (see Figure 2(b)). Table 6 breaks
down the destination cities of the packages. We see a clear trend that the
stuffers ship to Moscow and its suburbs (including Zheleznodorozhnyj
and Balashiha) and we notice that scammers tend to send the packages
to a limited number of addresses and cities, presumably to collect the
packages easily. Focusing inspection efforts on the packages destined
to the stuffers’ prime destination cities can increase the success of
intercepting items from reshipping scams.
6 Related Work
This paper is the ﬁrst large-scale, in-depth study of reshipping scams.
In this section we ﬁrst analyze previous research on related topics,
such as “money mules” (for money laundering) and mule recruiting in
general. Then we brieﬂy describe previous research that studied other
parts of criminal operations.
6.1 Mule Studies
A ﬁrst report on reshipping scams was published by the US Postal
Service in 2004 [8]. The report describes a scheme in which people
were recruited online to receive packages containing goods purchased
with stolen credit cards at their homes and sending them to a postal box
where the cybercriminal could collect them. The analysis performed in
this paper shows that this scheme has considerably evolved over the last
years, and that it is now controlled by well-organized criminal groups.
A wealth of research studied the means of cybercriminals to recruit
mules, and analyzed their demographics. Goett examined the recruit-
ment of money mules via online job boards [15] by collecting 126 email
alerts from two job aggregators, and discovering 177 mule posts on 80
different job boards during seven weeks. Goett’s main ﬁndings include
that scammers tend to post jobs under multiple company names, use a
chain of mules to launder money, and prefer mules that respond quickly
to requests. Florencio et al. showed that participating in money launder-
ing made mules liable according to the US consumer protections against
fraud [16], and resulted in mules losing money. The study also sug-
gested that the mule recruitment is the bottleneck in online fraud. In this
paper, we shed light on various components of reshipping scams, pro-
viding the research community with useful insights on this increasingly
popular monetization method for compromised payment instruments.
Moore et al. analyzed websites used to recruit mules on the Internet
and discovered that such sites show the tendency of staying online
for long periods of time even after they have been reported to Internet
Service Providers and law enforcement [17]. Aston et al. examined the
age, gender, and ZIP code of 660 conﬁrmed money mule cases during
2007, gathered by a major Australian ﬁnancial institution [18]. Their re-
sults showed that mule recruitment trended toward males between ages
25–34. Jones et al. conducted a 75-day analysis about the monetization
methods used by Nigerian scammers by creating 56 honeypot Craigslist
ads [19] and interacting with the scammers that contacted them. The
authors ﬁnd that victimized sellers can, among others, become money
mules, by caching fake checks sent to them as compensation for their
sold products, and wiring a portion of the money to scammers.
6.2 Cybercrime Studies
The reshipping scam schemes exposed in this paper are a popular
method used by cybercriminals to monetize stolen credit cards and are
therefore often used in conjunction with other fraud and information-
stealing schemes. In 2009, Stone-Gross et al. hijacked Torpig, an
information stealing botnet, and performed a detailed study of the
stolen data type and bot population [5]. Among other types of data,
the Torpig botnet specialized in stealing credit card information from
infected computers. Reshipping scams could potentially have been
employed by the cybercriminals to monetize the stolen credit cards.
A wealth of work has been conducted on analyzing cybercriminal op-
erations involving email spam and the underground economy surround-
ing it. Levchenko et al. [20] analyzed the monetization of spamming
botnets, and, in particular, studied the spam-advertised pharmaceutical,
software, and replica afﬁliate programs. Other studies analyzed the co-
ordination of spamming botnets and estimated the illicit proﬁt of cyber-
criminals [21–25]. Stringhini et al. developed a methodology to track
the different actors involved in spam operations, and analyzed the rela-
tionships between these actors [26]. Kanich et al. inﬁltrated the Storm
botnet and measured the conversion rate of spam [21]. McCoy et al. an-
alyzed customer demand and operation overheads of spam campaigns
by using transaction logs of pharmaceutical afﬁliate programs [27]. Our
work complements previous research by providing insights in a mon-
etization scheme that had, so far, evaded the attention of researchers.
Other research has examined how cybercriminals recruit workers
for various illicit operations [28, 29]. Meiklejohn et al. studied the
anonymity of bitcoin users [30]. Bitcoin and other digital currencies are
another method that cybercriminals use to launder the money , which
can be used instead of the reshipping schemes described in this paper.
Note, however, that attackers cannot account for the unpredictability
of the value of digital currencies thus, we argue that, monetization
through reshipping scams is more proﬁtable for attackers and thus,
more likely to be chosen over alternative monetization schemes.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented the ﬁrst in-depth and large-scale study
of reshipping as a service, a prominent way that cybercriminals use
to monetize stolen credit cards and other ﬁnancial instruments. We
have shown that criminals operate reshipping scams in different ways,
target different goods to be shipped through them, provide different
levels of service and guarantees, charge different fees, and split proﬁts
differently. Yet, our results also highlight similarities between different
reshipping scams when it comes to drop recruiting, management,
and churn. That is, the scam operators advertise work-from-home
and part-time jobs for recruitment and abandon mules by ceasing all
communications shortly before the mules should be paid.
Furthermore, we have shown that a single criminal-operated re-
shipping service (SHIPPING-C) can earn a yearly revenue of over
7.3 million US dollars, most of which is proﬁt. Additionally, based on
our analysis, we can estimate that nearly 1.6 million stolen credit cards
are fraudulently charged as part of reshipping scams each year. These
stolen credit cards, in turn, result in an estimated overall revenue for
criminal-operated reshipping scams of 1.8 billion US dollars, and are
possibly responsible for damages up to the same amount to merchants,
credit card holders, banks, and insurers. Finally, we proposed various
techniques that can be leveraged to disrupt the operation of reshipping
scams by identifying, and selectively delaying or stopping packages
containing repackaged merchandise that was purchased with stolen
credit cards.
