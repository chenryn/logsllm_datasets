# Reshipping Scams: A Comprehensive Analysis

## 5.4.1 Final Destinations of Reshipped Packages

The final destinations of reshipped packages are predominantly within the Moscow area and its suburbs, regardless of the reshipping site or the type of goods being targeted. Table 6 below provides a detailed breakdown of these destinations. It is evident that at least 85% of all reshipped packages are destined for Moscow.

| Destination | Percentage |
|-------------|------------|
| **SHIPPING-A** |            |
| Moscow Area, Russia | 85.89% |
| Moscow, Russia | 80.66% |
| Balashiha, Russia | 3.65% |
| Sverdlovskiy, Russia | 0.97% |
| Gorodok, Russia | 0.61% |
| Claymont, DE, US | 6.08% |
| Dover, DE, US | 2.43% |
| Other Cities | 5.60% |
| **SHIPPING-D** |            |
| Zheleznodorozhnyj, Russia | 89.07% |
| Balashiha, Russia | 63.13% |
| Moscow, Russia | 25.77% |
| Kiev, Ukraine | 0.17% |
| Nikolaev, Ukraine | 10.11% |
| Other Cities | 0.49% |
| **SHIPPING-E** |            |
| Moscow, Russia | 91.14% |
| Krasnodar, Russia | 4.36% |
| Stavropol, Russia | 1.45% |
| Other Cities | 3.05% |

**Table 6: Destinations of Reshipped Packages**

Moscow and its suburbs account for a clear majority of the final destinations, with at least 85% of all packages being reshipped to Moscow. This pattern suggests that the criminals prefer to use addresses within a small, controlled area to facilitate easy retrieval of the packages.

## 5.4.2 Label Purchases

To identify suspicious packages, one can track the purchase of package labels. Prepaid labels are used when drops mail the package to the stuffer, making this the last opportunity to intervene before the merchandise reaches the stuffer and the damage becomes irreversible. 

Key indicators for suspicious activity include:
- The buyer of the package label
- The extent to which a single account pays for multiple different labels (e.g., "white label" services)
- If packages always go to the same destination but are shipped by different senders

Based on this information, a risk score can be assigned to each label service and individual purchased label. This risk score captures the likelihood that the package contains goods paid for through illicit means, allowing for selective delays and aiding in discovery and recovery.

## 5.4.3 Reshipping Destinations

The final destinations of reshipped packages are usually overseas, with a strong preference for Moscow and its suburbs. Criminals tend to use addresses within a small, controlled area to ensure they can retrieve the packages without issues. Although apprehending criminals abroad is often challenging, understanding the patterns of reshipping destinations can help intercept international shipping packages before they leave the country, such as at USPS International Service Centers.

To better understand the distribution of final destinations, we used OCR techniques to extract recipient addresses from electronic shipping labels. Table 6 shows that stuffers primarily ship to Moscow and its suburbs, including Zheleznodorozhnyj and Balashiha. Scammers also tend to send packages to a limited number of addresses and cities, presumably to simplify collection. Focusing inspection efforts on packages destined for these prime destination cities can increase the success rate of intercepting items from reshipping scams.

## 6 Related Work

This paper presents the first large-scale, in-depth study of reshipping scams. We analyze previous research on related topics, such as money mules and mule recruitment, and briefly describe studies on other aspects of criminal operations.

### 6.1 Mule Studies

A 2004 report by the US Postal Service [8] described a scheme where people were recruited online to receive and forward packages containing goods purchased with stolen credit cards. Our analysis shows that this scheme has evolved significantly and is now controlled by well-organized criminal groups.

Goett [15] examined the recruitment of money mules via online job boards, finding that scammers post jobs under multiple company names, use a chain of mules to launder money, and prefer mules who respond quickly to requests. Florencio et al. [16] showed that participating in money laundering makes mules liable under US consumer protections against fraud, resulting in financial losses for mules. They suggested that mule recruitment is a bottleneck in online fraud.

Moore et al. [17] found that websites used to recruit mules remain online for extended periods even after being reported to ISPs and law enforcement. Aston et al. [18] analyzed the demographics of 660 confirmed money mule cases, finding a trend toward males aged 25-34. Jones et al. [19] conducted a 75-day analysis of monetization methods used by Nigerian scammers, revealing that victimized sellers can become money mules by cashing fake checks and wiring a portion of the money to scammers.

### 6.2 Cybercrime Studies

Reshipping scams are a popular method for cybercriminals to monetize stolen credit cards and are often used in conjunction with other fraud and information-stealing schemes. Stone-Gross et al. [5] hijacked the Torpig botnet and studied the types of data stolen, including credit card information. Reshipping scams could have been employed to monetize the stolen credit cards.

Levchenko et al. [20] analyzed the monetization of spamming botnets, focusing on pharmaceutical, software, and replica affiliate programs. Other studies have estimated the illicit profits of cybercriminals [21–25]. Stringhini et al. [26] developed a methodology to track actors involved in spam operations, while Kanich et al. [21] infiltrated the Storm botnet to measure spam conversion rates. McCoy et al. [27] analyzed customer demand and operational overheads of spam campaigns using transaction logs of pharmaceutical affiliate programs.

Other research has examined how cybercriminals recruit workers for various illicit operations [28, 29]. Meiklejohn et al. [30] studied the anonymity of Bitcoin users, noting that digital currencies like Bitcoin are another method for laundering money. However, the unpredictability of digital currency values makes reshipping scams more profitable and likely to be chosen over alternative monetization schemes.

## 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the first in-depth and large-scale study of reshipping as a service, a prominent method used by cybercriminals to monetize stolen credit cards and other financial instruments. We showed that criminals operate reshipping scams in various ways, targeting different goods, providing different levels of service and guarantees, charging different fees, and splitting profits differently. Despite these differences, there are similarities in drop recruiting, management, and churn. Scam operators typically advertise work-from-home and part-time jobs for recruitment and abandon mules shortly before payment.

Our analysis indicates that a single criminal-operated reshipping service (SHIPPING-C) can earn over $7.3 million annually, most of which is profit. We estimate that nearly 1.6 million stolen credit cards are fraudulently charged as part of reshipping scams each year, resulting in an overall revenue of $1.8 billion and potential damages of the same amount to merchants, credit card holders, banks, and insurers. We proposed various techniques to disrupt reshipping scams by identifying and selectively delaying or stopping packages containing repackaged merchandise purchased with stolen credit cards.
