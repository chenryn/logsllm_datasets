User: I have a script (Shell, chmod-ed to 755. Python is in the script, meaning not run from an outside .py file) that is executable. It works when I run it. How can I make a .app that executes said script on runtime? I have a simple .app that has this structure: APPNAME.App>Contents>MacOS>script
This does not run. Is there any way I can piggyback a script onto another application, The Powder Toy, for example? I'm not new to OSX, I just don't have root privileges and can't install XCode. 
Rembember, I can't install anything from source or use setup scripts, effectively annihilating py2app as an option.
EDIT:
This answer is courtesy of mklement0. Automator lets you choose the environment to run your script, type it in, and bundle it into a .app, removing the need for a shell script.
Assistant: Run Automator and create a new Application project.
Add a Run Shell Script action.
In the Shell: list, select the interpreter of choice; /usr/bin/python in this case.
Paste the contents of your Python script into the action and save the *.app bundle.
