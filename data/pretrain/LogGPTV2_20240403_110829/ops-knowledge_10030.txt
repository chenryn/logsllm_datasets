User: I am still very new to Python and any freezing programs.
Recently I made a very short text adventure game I'd like to send to a few friends, most of whom have Snow Leopard. I don't want them to have to bother downloading python just to play the game though. 
Is there a way to convert my game from Ubuntu so that it is playable on Mac? That is, make an .app file from ubuntu? Or even from Windows, I suppose.
I tried using cx_freeze on Windows but that just compiles an exe which is not playable on Mac.
Thanks for any help and suggestions. 
EDIT: I am using Python 3.2.2. I think Macs come standard with an older version else there would be no problem just sending them the game, I imagine.
Assistant: As far as I remember, last I used Mac OSX, it already had Python installed. This was with Mac OSX Snow Leopard.
