User: I'm developing a script that runs a program with other scripts over and over for testing purposes.
How it currently works is I have one Python script which I launch. That script calls the program and loads the other scripts. It kills the program after 60 seconds to launch the program again with the next script.
For some scripts, 60 seconds is too long, so I was wondering if I am able to set a FLAG variable (not in the main script), such that when the script finishes, it sets FLAG, so the main script and read FLAG and kill the process?
Thanks for the help, my writing may be confusing, so please let me know if you cannot fully understand.
Assistant: You cannot use environment variables in this way. As you have discovered it is not persistent after the setting application completes
