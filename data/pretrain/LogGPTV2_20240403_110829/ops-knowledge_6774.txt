User: How to query the current network connection status and analyze the network traffic on Linux?
Assistant: To query the current network connection status on Linux, you can use the netstat or ss command. Among them, the netstat command is used to display information such as network connections, routing tables, and network interfaces, while the ss command can query network connection status more quickly. The following are specific command examples: 1. Use the netstat command to list all current TCP connections: ``` netstat -ant ``` Among them, the -a parameter means to list all connections (including TCP and UDP), and the -n parameter means not to Perform DNS reverse lookup, the -t parameter indicates that only TCP connections are listed. 2. Use the ss command to list all current TCP connections: ``` ss -t -a ``` Among them, the -t parameter means to list only TCP connections, and the -a parameter means to list all connections. 3. Use the iftop command to monitor network traffic in real time: iftop is a terminal-based network traffic monitoring tool that can monitor network traffic in real time. ``` iftop -i eth0 ``` Among them, the -i parameter indicates specifying a network interface for monitoring, here we use eth0 as an example. This command will display the current real-time network traffic conditions, including upload and download speeds, source and destination addresses, and other information. 4. Use the tcpdump command to capture network traffic packets for analysis: tcpdump is a network packet sniffing tool that can capture network traffic packets for analysis. ``` tcpdump -i eth0 -n host 192.168.1.100 and port 80 ``` Among them, the -i parameter indicates that the specified network interface is to be captured, the -n parameter indicates that DNS reverse lookup is not performed, and the host parameter specifies the The IP address of the target host, and the port parameter specifies the target port number to be captured. This command will capture all the network traffic packets whose target host IP address is 192.168.1.100 and target port number is 80, and output the detailed information of these packets to the terminal. Network traffic analysis can be performed based on the output information.
