Okay please check this fiddle out: http://jsfiddle.net/p97xS/3/  
So the issue is, When you open or close a popover by clicking the element on
which the `popover` is initiated everything works well. Good!
However problem arises when you plan to hide popover through another element
(or button) using `$('#example').popover('hide')`. Sure the content and the
popover is hidden but they are actually still present in the DOM. Which means
if a popover `data-content` consists of buttons, you can still click them even
if they are hidden!
So in the example fiddle, click the main button - a popover appears. Now hide
it using the second button. Popover is hidden but its contents are still
clickable!
