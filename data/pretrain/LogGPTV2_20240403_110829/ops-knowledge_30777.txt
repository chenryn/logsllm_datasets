User: Please explain what is the purpose of using load balancing in network architecture? What are some common load balancing algorithms?
Assistant: The main purpose of using load balancing in network architecture is to improve the availability and performance of the system. The role of load balancing is to distribute traffic to multiple servers or nodes, so that each server or node can undertake a more reasonable workload and ensure system stability and reliability. Common load balancing algorithms include: 1. Round robin algorithm: Assign requests to different servers according to the round robin order, and perform the cycle to distribute the load evenly. 2. Random algorithm: Randomly select a server to process the request, suitable for scenarios without special requirements. 3. The algorithm of the minimum number of connections: allocate requests to the server with the least number of connections to avoid overloading some servers. 4. Minimum response time algorithm: Select the server with the shortest response time to process the request, ensuring that users can get a quick response. 5. Based on the hash value algorithm: Match according to the hash value of the request, and assign the request to a specific server to ensure that the specific request is always processed by the same server.
