A lot of new features related to the auto-wiring have been added recently:
  * Autowiring
  * Setter auto-wiring
  * Getter auto-wiring
IMO, especially with the last two, it starts to become necessary to have more
tooling to debug auto-wiring. For example, I am a developer coming onto an
existing Symfony project which make moderate or heavy use of the auto-wiring
feature. Regardless of if the usage of this feature has been done wisely or
not, in that situation, I should be able to easily tell what services is auto-
wired and its surrounding effects (e.g. if #21031: what other services are
auto-wired?).
I have in mind a command to list all the auto-wired services with eventually
details on which level of auto-wiring is used. But maybe someone has a better
or other suggestions in mind?
