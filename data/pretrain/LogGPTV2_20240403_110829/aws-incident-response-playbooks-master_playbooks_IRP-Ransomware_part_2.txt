b.	Identify business owner and workload classification (example: mission critical, high risk, etc.)
12.	Determine and begin to document end-user impact/experience of the issue. This should be documented in the ticket/case related to the incident. If there are impacted users, determine from them the steps that led to the incident. This will assist you to establish the attack vector used to execute the ransomware. Mitigations against this vector should be placed in later steps of this process.
13.	Internal Communications:
a.	Identify stakeholder roles from your organization’s incident response plan, the application entry in the Configuration Management Database CMDB (if one exists), or via the application’s risk register
b.	Open an Incident Response bridge to have a regular communication channel about the incident.
c.	Notify identified stakeholders including (if required) legal personnel, technical teams and developers and add them to the ticket and the war room, so they are updated as the ticket is updated
14.	External Communications:
i.	Ensure your organization’s legal counsel is informed and is included in status updates to internal stakeholders and especially in regards to external communications.
ii.	For colleagues in the organization that are responsible for providing public/external communication statements, ensure these internal stakeholders are added to the ticket so they receive regular status updates regarding the incident and can complete their own requirements for communications within and external to the business.
iii.	If there are regulations in your jurisdiction requiring reporting of such incidents, ensure the people in your organization responsible for notifying local or federal law enforcement agencies are also notified of the event. Consult your legal advisor and/or law enforcement for guidance on collecting and preserving the evidence and the chain of custody.
iv.	There may not be regulations, but either open databases, government agencies or NGOs may track this type of activity. Your reporting may assist others
### Part 2: Contain the Incident
Early detection of anomalous user behavior or network activity is key to reducing the impact of ransomware incidents. The below steps can be taken to help to contain the incident. If applicable, work with the legal and compliance team of your organization on any required response and continue the incident response process outlined here.
1.	If possible, determine the type of ransomware used in the incident:
a.	Crypto Ransomware - Objects/files will be encrypted
b.	Locker ransomware - Locks out access to the device
c.	A different type, or previously not observed type
2.	For identified AWS resources associated with your impacted workloads, isolate network or internet connectivity by modifying Security groups, S3 bucket Policies or relevant identity and access management policies as applicable to minimize opportunities for the infection to be spread, or for threat actors to have access to those resources. Keep in mind that sometimes modifying security groups may not have the intended impact, due to connection tracking.
3.	Determine whether the EC2 instance actually needs to be recovered, or not. For example, if the impacted instance is part of an AWS Application Auto Scaling group, removing the instance from the group will trigger a scaling action. If the incident is linked to a vulnerable package on the host’s operating system, updating the AMI used in the Launch configuration and confirming the vulnerability has been patched (check the Mitre CVE database) will also be required.
4.	Check your CloudTrail log for unauthorized activity such as creation of unauthorized IAM users, policies, roles or temporary security credentials. Delete any unauthorized IAM users, roles, and policies, and revoke any temporary credentials.
5.	If you’re dealing with this incident as part of a broader security incident in the account, a drastic approach could be to use AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs) to restrict any API call to be made from that AWS account (assuming it is not the master account of the Organization). Please note this may impact other running workloads as SCPs applied at the account level will be enforced on all the IAM entities associated in it. This may prevent malicious actors from inflicting further damage on the account’s resources and data.
6.	If the attack vector was made possible by un-patched software, operating system updates, out-of-date malware/anti-virus tools, ensure that all EC2 instances are either updated to the latest version of operating system, all software packages and patches are up-to-date and virus signatures and definition files on all EC2 instances are up-to-date. This may be done by several methods:
a.	Patch-in-place for mutable architectures
b.	Re-deploy for immutable architectures
7.	Depending on what occurred in Step 6 above, remove any remaining resources that are identified as being at risk of infection (that may have accessed the same vector that downloaded the ransomware, whether that be via email, visiting an infected website, or something else). If it is part of a larger fleet managed by Auto Scaling, containment efforts may be better focused on establishing the attack vector and then placing mitigations that will prevent other resources in the fleet from becoming infected via the same vector.
### Part 3: Eradicate the Incident
1.	It is important to understand if the impact from the incident is contained to a subset of the environment. If there is an ability to restore the ransomed data from backups/snapshots, you can refer to the recover from the incident section.  Note that there may still be value in exploring the incident under an isolated environment to run the root cause analysis and use controls to avoid situation in the future.
2.	Investigate potential use of up-to-date antivirus or anti-malware software to clean the ransomware. Refer to this step with caution as it may alert the actor (see earlier steps to remove network access from the impacted EC2 instance). You can review the locked/encrypted objects in an isolated forensic environment.
3.	Review any GuardDuty findings if there are any high or medium severity alerts that can help to reduce the additional effort required to search application level logs. GuardDuty findings provide recommendations on how to remediate the finding.
4.	Remove any malware that was identified during the forensic analysis and identify Indicators of Compromise.
5.	If the ransomware strain has been identified, determine if any 3rd party decryption tools are available, or if any other online resources may help
### Part 4: Recover from the Incident
1.	Identify the restore point for any restore operation performed from backup.
2.	Review the backup strategy and see if you can recover all the objects and files. This will depend on the lifecycle policies applied on the resources.
3.	Restore the data from your backup, or revert to an earlier snapshot of the EC2 instance’s volumes. Apply forensic methods to confirm that data is clean before restoring it. Ensure any spread vectors are identified & resolved.
4.	Alternatively, if you have been successful in using any open source de-crypter tool to retrieve the data, remove that data from the instance and perform any required analysis to ensure the data is clean.  Then, recover the instance, terminate it or quarantine it and create a new one, and restore the data to a new instance.
5.	If restoring from a backup and de-crypting the data is not an option, consider whether to start from entirely new environment is a possibility .
### Part 5: Post-Incident Activity
1.	Documenting and cycling lessons learned during simulations and live incidents back into “new normal” processes and procedures allows organizations to better understand how an incident occurred with their configurations and processes – such as where they were vulnerable, where automation may have failed, or where visibility was lacking – and the opportunity to strengthen their overall security posture.
2.	If you identified the initial attack vector or point of entry, determine how best to mitigate the risk of a re-occurrence. For example, if the malware gained initial entry due to an un-patched public-facing EC2 instance, and assuming you applied the missing patch to all current instances, how can you improve your patching process to ensure that patches are tested and applied sooner and with more consistency and reliability?
3.	If you’ve developed set technical steps to take for a given threat, assess opportunities to automate those actions upon detection to mitigate the threat as quickly as possible to minimize scope and severity of impact.
4.	Ensure you collect lessons learned from all stakeholders and update your incident response plan, disaster recovery plans, and this playbook as necessary. And where appropriate, consider priorities and funding for new technical capabilities and personnel skills to fill any gaps.

### Preparation
As with other incident response scenarios, mitigating ransomware threats requires a strong preventative strategy and preparation is very important. More so than others though, mitigation techniques rely on adequate preparation prior to a ransomware incident. Implementing best practices based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework will help you in your preparation. If key preventative measures are not already in place, these must be considered as part of any post-incident activity including any tools or techniques that failed during the incident response process itself, such as automation, integration with partner offerings, application and systems observability, etc. The below points cover some key preparation steps.
1.	Adopt foundational best practices:  Leverage AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and AWS Well-Architected best practices to your organization's cybersecurity framework such as the NIST CyberSecurity Framework for AWS, a framework focused on security outcomes organized around five functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) and foundational activities that map to existing standards, accreditations and frameworks.
2.	Training:  Cybersecurity awareness training for your employees. Social engineering is one of the common methods used to induce end users to download an infected file.
3.	Deep dive on assets and configurations:  Identifying your IT assets is a vital component of governance and security. You must have visibility into all your data storage services and resources in order to evaluate their security posture and effectively configure them. Reduce potential attack surface, for instance, by analysing your public data footprint. If you use Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), ensure that your S3 buckets use the correct policies and are not publicly accessible. Implement the idea of least privilege enterprise-wide. With S3 Versioning, existing versions of your data are immutable: actors cannot change existing objects, and any modification is going to result in a new version. Use MFA delete to require a second element of authentication for S3 data deletion. In addition, S3 includes a number of security controls to consider when developing and implementing your own security policies; for more information, please see [security best practices for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/security-best-practices.html).
4.	Stay up-to-date with system patches:  Ransomware often relies on exploit kits to gain access to a system or network using known threats. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) resources can use AWS Systems Manager to automatically collect software inventory, apply OS patches, create system images, and configure Windows and Linux operating systems. These capabilities enable automated configuration and ongoing management of systems at scale, and help maintain software compliance for instances running in EC2.
5.	Continuous monitoring:  
a.	Use Amazon Inspector to assess your deployed EC2 instances for CVEs and deviation from best practice. Build a CI/CD pipeline to remediate security findings automatically & periodically. Amazon Inspector finds applications by querying the package manager or software installation system on the operating system where the agent is installed. This means that software that was installed through the package manager is assessed for vulnerabilities. You can also leverage AWS Security Competency Partner offerings to help inspect your application deployments for security risks and vulnerabilities, while providing priorities and advice to assist with remediation.
b.	AWS developed a new open source Self-Service Security Assessment tool (with ransomware analysis modules) that provides customers with a point-in-time assessment to quickly gain valuable insights into the security posture of their AWS account. For continuous monitoring of your security posture, AWS recommends enabling AWS Security Hub’s Foundational Security Best Practices standard, which also provides automated security checks.
6.	Data back-up:  Create secure backups of your data on a regular basis. AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate the backup of data across AWS services.  If backups are not a requirement, ensure that there are regular snapshots or an up-to-date AMI that can be used either for recovery or replacement of the impacted EC2 instance. Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier are durable, low-cost storage platforms. Both offer unlimited capacity and require no volume or media management as backup data sets grow. Backup and Recovery Approaches Using AWS.
7.	Testing:  Implement, review and test disaster recovery scenarios for your organizational needs. This will help you determine the path for implementing recovery mechanisms and mitigate risks. Disaster recovery is about preparing for and recovering from an event that has a negative impact on your business goals. You can use CloudEndure Disaster Recovery to quickly recover your environment, minimizing data loss and downtime in the case of a ransomware incident.
8.	Automation:  Where you identify fixed technical procedures that don’t deviate or require a human to make a decision, explore the opportunity to automate protections and response actions to mitigate the threat as quickly as possible to minimize scope and severity of impact.
Communication channels:  Identify communication channels such as an Incident Response bridge that you will need to use during the incident to communicate with the internal and external stakeholders.
