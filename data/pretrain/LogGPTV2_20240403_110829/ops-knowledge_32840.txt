To effectively implement CIS Control 4.12, which focuses on separating enterprise workspaces on mobile end-user devices, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Assessment of Device Capabilities**: Determine whether the mobile devices in use support workspace separation. This feature is commonly available on modern iOS and Android devices.

2. **Selection of Implementation Method**:
   - For **iOS devices**, utilize Apple® Configuration Profiles to create a distinct, managed environment for enterprise applications and data.
   - For **Android devices**, employ Android™ Work Profiles to achieve a similar separation between corporate and personal data.

3. **Policy Development**: Develop and document policies that clearly outline the usage guidelines for both enterprise and personal workspaces. Ensure that employees understand the importance of maintaining this separation and the potential consequences of non-compliance.

4. **Deployment and Configuration**:
   - Configure and deploy the chosen method (e.g., Apple® Configuration Profile or Android™ Work Profile) using a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution.
   - Ensure that the MDM solution is set up to enforce the necessary security policies, such as encryption, password requirements, and remote wipe capabilities.

5. **User Training and Awareness**: Provide comprehensive training to all users on how to use the separated workspaces, including best practices for securing their devices and the importance of keeping enterprise and personal data separate.

6. **Monitoring and Enforcement**: Regularly monitor and audit the use of the separated workspaces to ensure compliance with organizational policies. Use the MDM solution to track and manage device configurations and to take corrective actions if necessary.

7. **Ongoing Maintenance and Updates**: Keep the MDM solution and mobile operating systems up to date with the latest security patches and updates. Regularly review and update the policies and configurations to address new threats and changes in the organizational environment.

By following these procedures, an organization can effectively implement CIS Control 4.12, enhancing the protection of enterprise data while allowing employees to maintain personal data on their mobile devices. This control falls under the asset type "Devices" and serves the security function of "Protect."
