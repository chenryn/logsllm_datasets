## Abstract
This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting self-propagating email viruses using statistical anomaly detection. The approach is based on the assumption that a key objective of an email virus attack is to overwhelm mail servers and clients with a large volume of email traffic. By detecting significant increases in traffic volume over what was observed during a training period, our method aims to identify such attacks. This paper details the approach and presents the results of simulation-based experiments conducted in an intranet setting. Our results show that the approach effectively detects all attacks with very few false alarms, and can detect attacks early enough to limit the number of infected email clients.

## Introduction
Email viruses have become a major Internet security threat. These malicious programs hide in email attachments and activate when the attachment is opened. A primary goal of email virus attacks, such as Melissa, is to generate a large volume of email traffic, overwhelming email servers and clients, and disrupting the email service. Future viruses may be even more damaging, potentially creating hidden backdoors on infected machines for coordinated attacks.

Current approaches for dealing with email viruses rely on anti-virus software at various points in the network, including desktops, network servers, and gateways. Detection is typically based on signature-based methods, which are effective against known viruses but ineffective against new, unknown ones. To address this, recent techniques focus on virus behavior, such as rapid email generation or self-replication, rather than their representation. However, these "behavior-blocking" approaches can still be evaded by viruses that propagate slowly or replicate after a delay.

An alternative approach is to focus on the ultimate effect of self-propagating email viruses: an increase in email traffic. Simple adaptations, such as reducing the propagation factor, introducing time delays, or randomization, do not change this fundamental effect. Therefore, our approach is based on detecting increases in email traffic volume.

Given the variability in email traffic across different sites and times, it is challenging to manually develop characterizations of excessive traffic. Machine learning offers a solution by training the system to learn normal email traffic characteristics and then detect significant deviations. In the context of intrusion detection, anomaly detection has been associated with high false-alarm rates and moderate false-negative rates. This paper develops and evaluates an approach that appears capable of detecting attacks with very low false alarm rates while still detecting them early.

The paper first outlines our anomaly-based detection approach for self-propagating email viruses. We conducted two complementary simulation-based experiments to assess the performance of this approach. The first experiment used a simplistic user model to create stealthy virus behaviors, while the second experiment aimed for more realistic user models and accurate reproduction of email system behaviors, though with less stealthy virus models.

### Key Benefits of Our Approach
- **Accurate Detection**: Our simulation-based experiments demonstrated near-zero false alarm rates and 100% detection.
- **Robust Against Polymorphic and Stealthy Viruses**: The technique reliably detects polymorphic and stealthy viruses, although detection may be delayed.
- **Low Runtime Overhead**: The approach has minimal runtime overhead and a robust learning phase that does not require expert supervision.

While these results are promising, they are based on simulated behaviors, and real-world variability may affect the outcomes. Ongoing work aims to address this by using actual mail server logs for normal email traffic.

## Overview of the Approach
Our approach is based on specification-based anomaly detection, combining state-machine specifications of network protocols with statistical machine learning. The protocol models the interaction between email clients and the email server within an organization. The state machine classifies events into different categories based on the transitions taken. Machine learning techniques are then used to learn statistics associated with each category, focusing on characteristics related to increased email traffic.

### State Machine Model
We developed a state machine to model email server behavior, as shown in Figure 1. The state machine has three states: INIT, RCVD, and DONE. The reception of an email from a client is modeled using the `send` event, and the forwarding of the message to recipients is modeled using the `deliver` event. The DONE state signifies the completion of processing, which is modeled using a timeout.

#### Formal Specification
We use extended finite state automata (EFSA) to capture the state machine model. The EFSA in Figure 1 consists of three control states (INIT, RCVD, and DONE), three events (`send`, `deliver`, and `timeout`), and two state variables (`sender` and `id`).

### Statistics of Interest
We maintain the following statistics:
- Frequency with which the `send` transition is taken, across all clients.
- Frequency with which the `deliver` transition is taken, across all clients.
- For each client C, the frequency with which emails from C take the `send` transition.
- For each client C, the frequency with which emails from C take the `deliver` transition.

These statistics are maintained at multiple time scales, ranging from about a second to about an hour. We use histograms to represent the frequency distributions over these time windows, as observed during the training period.

By leveraging these statistics, our approach can effectively detect significant increases in email traffic, thereby identifying potential self-propagating email viruses.
