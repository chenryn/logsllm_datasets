Percent Certificates Misissued
Fig. 3: Percent Misissuance by Organization Size—We
show a CDF of the percent misissuance in organizations for
three sizes, those that issue 100 K certiﬁcates. Larger organizations misissue a
smaller fraction of their total certiﬁcates compared to smaller
organizations.
our dataset, and have near-zero misissuance rates (Table I).
Let’s Encrypt, the largest CA by number of certiﬁcates issued,
has a particularly stellar misissuance rate. Of the 37 million
certiﬁcates the CA has signed, only 13 contain errors.4 No
certiﬁcate issued by Let’s Encrypt contains warnings.
On the ﬂip side, nearly half of authorities (48% by organi-
zation) misissue at least 10% of certiﬁcates (Figure 4). These
authorities tend to be small, issuing fewer than 1,000 certiﬁcates
a piece (Figure 3, Figure 5). Eighteen organizations (3%) have
misissued all certiﬁcates. In most of these cases, the same
4The 13 certiﬁcates that Let’s Encrypt misissued contain invalid UTF-8
encoding for internationalized domain names and have since been revoked [2].
errors are present on each certiﬁcate within an organization. For
example, all Nestle certiﬁcates contain the same error: failure
to include a certiﬁcate policy statement (CPS). While this
might not seem surprising, it does contrast with the authorities
responsible for the most misissuance by raw number. We show
the organizations with the highest misissuance rates in Table II.
The authorities responsible for the largest number of
misissued certiﬁcates tend to be mid-sized and misissue a small
number of certiﬁcates relative to their size. Their misissuances
inconsistently violate various standards, but the bulk of their
errors are associated with a single type of problem. In the
most extreme example, GoDaddy is responsible for nearly 40 K
misissued certiﬁcates (28.6% of all misissuances), but only
2.4% of GoDaddy certiﬁcates contain errors.
We note that our investigation likely underestimates misis-
suance for companies that have acquired smaller authorities
because we group CA certiﬁcates using the embedded Organi-
zation ﬁeld. For example, at the time our study in July 2017,
Symantec Corporation owned four of the authorities that
misissued the largest number of certiﬁcates: VeriSign, GeoTrust,
Thawte, and Symantec [11], [15], [46]. In another example,
WoSign owned StartCom [49]. To understand the impact this
has on our results, we consider misissuance rates based on
CA Owner in CCADB [32]. This ﬁeld, however, does not
always indicate the party responsible for a speciﬁc intermediate
certiﬁcate. For example, IdenTrust appeared as the owner for
Let’s Encrypt until they established their own, independent
trust anchor. However, it may identify cases not surfaced by
grouping intermediates by their embedded organization ﬁeld.
For the most part, we identify the same set of authorities
with the greatest misissuance, but with slightly differing
misissuance rates. For example, we ﬁnd that DigiCert
is
responsible for 7,203 (1%) misissued certiﬁcates. The approach
identiﬁed one additional, signiﬁcant CA Owner, Deutsche
Telekom, which misissued nearly 20% of all of its certiﬁcates—
just over 10K certiﬁcates in total. There were 59 intermediates
in our dataset that were not registered in CCADB at the time
of our investigation.
B. What Do Authorities Get Wrong?
Authorities make a variety of errors when issuing certiﬁcates
(Table III). Of the 179 error lints and 41 warning lints in
ZLint, 97 (54.2%) and 25 (61%) were triggered at least
once, respectively. The most common error (by misissued
certiﬁcates) is that authorities fail to correctly populate the
Subject Alternate Names (SANs) extension. This error accounts
for 70 K misissued certiﬁcates (31%); 94 authorities have
made the error at least once. 45 authorities similarly fail to
include the SAN extension. Most of the failures to include the
extension are the responsibility of GoDaddy, who issued 94%
of the 40K certiﬁcates with this error in 2012–2013. This error
results in GoDaddy being responsible for the largest number
of misissuances in our dataset. Symantec was responsible for
the second most misissued certiﬁcates (23K), of which 95%
failed to properly encode internationalized domain names in the
common name ﬁeld. WoSign, StartCom, and VeriSign failed to
include the authority key identiﬁer extension in 11.7 K, 9.8 K,
and 9.8 K certiﬁcates respectively.

TABLE III: Most Common ZLint Errors and Warnings
issued at
For all of the organizations that
least 10K
certiﬁcates in our dataset, one error accounts for at least 90%
of all errors for that authority. However, we also note that
63% of the authorities that issued at least 100K certiﬁcates
made at least ten errors. This contrasts with organizations that
misissue nearly all their certiﬁcates, as they generally misissue
all of their certiﬁcates in the exact same way. The lints that
the largest number of authorities triggered are that the email
ﬁeld is present in the SAN extension (44% of organizations),
the SAN is not properly populated (15.2%), and DNSName
entries are not well-formed (13.4%).
authorities owned by Symantec at the time of our study—
trigger warnings for 99% of their certiﬁcates. All of these
fail to include the subject key identiﬁer (SKID) extension
in end-entity certiﬁcates. Despite accounting for 90% of the
warnings triggered by ZLint, this warning is only triggered by
23 (3.7%) authorities. The second most common warning is
that the extended key usage extension is not marked critical,
which appears in 260 K certiﬁcates and is triggered at least once
in 408 (66%) authorities. HostPoint AG triggers this warning
the most—it appears in 62 K of their certiﬁcates. They are
followed closely by WoSign, which issues 61 K certiﬁcates
with this warning.
C. Warnings
D. Intermediate Diversity
In additional to making errors, authorities often fail to
adhere to recommendations in community standards (i.e., ZLint
warnings). Unlike errors, there are a handful of large players
who do not follow community recommendations (Figure 6).
For example, Symantec, GeoTrust, and Thawte—three large
While it is difﬁcult to externally observe what causes
mid-to-large sized authorities to misissue a large number of
certiﬁcates, we do observe one pattern. Table IV shows the
“largest offending intermediate” in raw ZLint error output for
organizations that issue more than 10 K certiﬁcates. We ﬁnd
