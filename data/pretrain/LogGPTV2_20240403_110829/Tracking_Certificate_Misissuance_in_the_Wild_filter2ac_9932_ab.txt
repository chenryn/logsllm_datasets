### Misissuance Rates and Certificate Errors: An Analysis

#### Overview
The following data and analysis provide insights into the rates of certificate misissuance and errors over the years, highlighting the performance of different certificate authorities (CAs) and the common issues they face.

#### Data Summary (2015-2017)
| Year | Total Certificates | Certificates with Warnings | Certificates with Errors |
|------|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 2015 | 2.3 M             | 609,646 (26.3%)            | 1.8 M (25.4%)           |
| 2016 | 2.9 M             | 860,481 (29.9%)            | 3.4 M (6.7%)            |
| 2017 | 3.6 M             | 933,358 (26.2%)            | 3.4 M (3.3%)            |

**Figure 2: Misissuance Rates**
- The fraction of misissued certificates has significantly reduced over the past five years.

**Figure 3: Percent Misissuance by Organization Size**
- Larger organizations generally have lower misissuance rates compared to smaller ones.
- For organizations issuing more than 100,000 certificates, the misissuance rate is near-zero.

**Performance of Let's Encrypt**
- Let's Encrypt, the largest CA by number of certificates issued, has an exceptionally low misissuance rate. Out of 37 million certificates, only 13 contain errors, all of which have been revoked due to invalid UTF-8 encoding for internationalized domain names [2].

**Misissuance by Other CAs**
- Nearly half of the CAs (48% by organization) misissue at least 10% of their certificates.
- Small CAs, issuing fewer than 1,000 certificates, tend to have higher misissuance rates.
- Eighteen organizations (3%) have misissued all of their certificates, often due to a single, consistent error.

**Common Errors and Warnings**
- The most common error is the failure to correctly populate the Subject Alternate Names (SANs) extension, accounting for 70,000 misissued certificates (31%).
- GoDaddy, Symantec, StartCom, and WoSign are among the CAs with the highest number of misissued certificates, primarily due to specific types of errors.

**Impact of Acquisitions**
- Our investigation may underestimate misissuance for companies that have acquired smaller CAs, as we group certificates using the embedded Organization field.
- For example, Symantec Corporation owned VeriSign, GeoTrust, Thawte, and Symantec, and WoSign owned StartCom.
- Using the CA Owner field in CCADB provides a more accurate picture, identifying additional significant CAs like Deutsche Telekom, which misissued nearly 20% of its certificates.

**Detailed Analysis of Errors and Warnings**
- **Table II: Organizations with Highest Misissuance**
  - Shows the organizations with the highest misissuance rates by both fraction and raw count.
  - Includes details on the number of intermediates each organization is responsible for.

- **Table III: Most Common ZLint Errors and Warnings**
  - Lists the most common errors and warnings, their sources, and the number of affected certificates.
  - The most common error is the missing or incorrectly populated SAN extension, followed by invalid characters in DNSName and missing authority key identifier (AKID).

- **Table IV: Intermediate Contribution to Organizational Misissuance**
  - Highlights the intermediate CA that contributes the most to misissuance within each organization.
  - In 80% of organizations issuing more than 10,000 certificates, the majority of misissued certificates are generated by just one intermediate.

**Figures and Graphs**
- **Figure 4: Misissuance Rates**
  - Illustrates the misissuance rates for intermediates, organizations, business owners, and root CAs.
  
- **Figure 5: Percent ZLint Errors by Total Certificates Issued**
  - Shows that large CAs generally issue certificates with fewer ZLint errors compared to smaller CAs.
  
- **Figure 6: Percent ZLint Warnings by Total Certificates Issued**
  - Indicates that ZLint warnings are more dispersed throughout the ecosystem, affecting both large and small players.

### Conclusion
The analysis reveals a significant reduction in certificate misissuance rates over the years, with larger CAs generally performing better. However, smaller CAs and those with specific, recurring errors still pose a challenge. Understanding and addressing these common errors can help improve the overall security and reliability of the certificate issuance process.
