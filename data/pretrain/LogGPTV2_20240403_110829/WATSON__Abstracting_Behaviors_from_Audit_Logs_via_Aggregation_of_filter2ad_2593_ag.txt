uncover the contextual semantics of audit events. Our principle
of using TransE is its translational distance matching our
knowledge of event usage context. UNICORN [33] presents a
graph sketching algorithm to summarize long-running system
executions. Essentially, it makes use of statistical properties of
graphs to represent semantic information, which is different
from our contextual semantics learning approach.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Abstracting high-level behaviors from low-level audit logs
is a key task in security response. It helps to bridge the seman-
tic gap between audit events and system behaviors and thus
reduce human efforts in log analysis. In this paper, we propose
an automated approach, WATSON, to abstract behaviors from
audit logs. WATSON addresses two primary challenges in event
semantics inference and behavior summarization and aggrega-
tion. Speciﬁcally, WATSON leverages contextual information
in log-based knowledge graphs to enable semantics inference.
To distinguish representative behaviors, WATSON provides a
vector representation of behavior semantics and uses it to
cluster semantically similar behaviors. We evaluate WATSON
against both behaviors simulated from real-life cyber attacks
as well as behaviors of an adversarial engagement organized
by DARPA. Our experimental results show that WATSON can
accurately abstract both benign and malicious behaviors and
dramatically reduce manual workload in attack investigation.
