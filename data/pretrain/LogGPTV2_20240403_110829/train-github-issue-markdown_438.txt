# Description of the new enhancement
Currently windows terminal does not support vim (vim for windows) completely.
When vim is launched from the windows terminal, the document opens fine and
all of the vim features are available. The only issue is that the rendering of
the document is with blue color as opposed to normal terminal background-color
(say black)

Due to the improper rendering, the syntax highlighting feature of vim no
longer works.  
When vim is launched from the terminal it should respect `.vimrc` file of the
user.
It will be helpful if I can use vim in the windows terminal directly :)
### A clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new
enhancement would solve.
Describe why and how a user would use this new functionality (if applicable).
It would be really helpful if I can use vim for windows on the windows
terminal. Ever since the new terminal was announced I was looking forward to
using vim on it. Currently, I use vim software for windows.
