## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce MATor, a framework for rigorously assessing the degree of anonymity in the Tor network. The framework explicitly addresses how user anonymity is affected by real-world characteristics of deployed Tor, such as its path selection algorithm, Tor consensus data, and user preferences and connections. The anonymity assessment is based on rigorous anonymity bounds derived from an extension of the ANOA framework (IEEE CSF 2013). We demonstrate how to apply MATor to Tor’s publicly available consensus and server descriptor data, thereby realizing the first real-time anonymity monitor. Based on experimental evaluations of this anonymity monitor using Tor Metrics data, we propose an alternative path selection algorithm that provides stronger anonymity guarantees without degrading the overall performance of the Tor network.

## 1. Introduction
The Tor network is a widely used low-latency anonymous communication service [30]. To provide anonymity, Tor routes a user’s traffic through three anonymizing proxies (nodes) chosen from over 5000 volunteer nodes. This raises a central question from a user’s perspective:
- How anonymous is the channel created by Tor, i.e., how likely is it that an adversary can deanonymize the user?

Deriving the degree of a user’s anonymity is challenging due to the complexity of the system, where each of the 5000 fluctuating nodes has different bandwidths and offers different sets of ports for communication. Previous mathematically founded analyses have abstracted the Tor network, ignoring key characteristics such as the path selection algorithm, varying node bandwidths, and user-requested ports [6, 13–16, 19]. These real-world characteristics significantly influence a user’s anonymity, rendering previously proven bounds inaccurate.

### Contribution
We present MATor, the first system to derive sender, recipient, and relationship anonymity guarantees based on Tor’s real-world characteristics, including its actual path selection strategy. Our anonymity definitions are grounded in the ANOA framework [6] and are modular. MATor includes lightweight real-time monitors that compute these anonymity guarantees based on the actual Tor consensus data and user-requested ports.

Since ANOA, the theoretical framework upon which MATor is based, does not provide a formalism to model adversaries in realistic scenarios, we extend ANOA with the concepts of adversary classes and adaptive user behavior. These adversary classes allow us to restrict the strong ANOA adversary to the scenario of interest, while extending ANOA with adaptive user behavior enables interactive communication scenarios. We show that sequential composition does not hold for some adversary classes and characterize those for which it does. This extension of the ANOA framework is of independent interest for analyzing other anonymous communication networks.

Using MATor, we conduct experiments on Tor Metrics [29] data spanning the last 24 months. These experiments illustrate that anonymity guarantees fluctuate substantially on an hourly basis, underscoring the value of MATor’s real-time monitoring. The experiments also highlight the influence of entrusted bandwidth on a user’s anonymity, as Tor’s path selection algorithm places a large amount of trust in single high-bandwidth nodes, similar to choosing a single anonymizing proxy. Based on our findings, we propose DISTRIBUTOR, a novel path selection algorithm that improves all three considered anonymity notions (sender, recipient, and relationship anonymity) by redistributing trust in single high-bandwidth nodes to a larger set of Tor nodes. Unlike previous proposals that solely focus on improving user anonymity [4, 11], our path selection algorithm preserves the overall performance of the Tor network.

### Related Work
There are two lines of work in the literature about estimating the degree of anonymity of Tor users. The first line assumes a worst-case adversary and proves rigorous anonymity bounds for Tor users [6, 13–16, 19]. However, these works abstract the Tor network, ignoring characteristics that significantly influence a user’s anonymity. The second line models Tor’s anonymity-relevant characteristics more accurately [22, 31], but they do not yield provable bounds on the degree of a user’s anonymity and cannot be performed in real time on commodity hardware.

With respect to improving Tor’s path selection algorithm, there is extensive work. Wang et al. [32] focus on improving Tor’s latency with a congestion-aware path selection, but their approach does not improve and even slightly reduces a user’s anonymity. In contrast, several proposals aim to improve the anonymity of single users in Tor [4, 11, 23], but they ignore the impact on the overall performance of the Tor network. Our proposed path selection algorithm, DISTRIBUTOR, significantly improves user anonymity while preserving the overall performance of the Tor network.

## 2. Overview
The Tor network is an overlay network consisting of OR nodes that relay user traffic and a distributed directory service that maintains and provides cryptographic and routing information about the OR nodes. Users select a sequence of three OR nodes based on directory information, such as bandwidth and accepted ports, and create a circuit over the selected set. The selection of nodes is done through a weighted random choice, with the weight depending on the node’s bandwidth.

Our goal is to perform a rigorous real-time analysis of a user’s anonymity bounds in the presence of real-life parameters, such as the current path selection algorithm, within a mathematically founded framework. Due to the lack of a suitable off-the-shelf framework, we extend the ANOA framework [6] to include interactive communication scenarios and restrict the adversary’s power by introducing adversary classes. These classes allow for defining various user profiles and realistic restrictions for the adversary.

In Section 3, we extend the ANOA framework to include interactive communication scenarios and introduce adversary classes. In Section 4, we describe Tor and its path selection to illustrate the variety of parameters that need to be carefully considered. We then define MATor as a framework for assessing a user’s anonymity in the Tor network, deriving bounds on the degree of anonymity based on the path selection algorithm and actual Tor consensus data. We base the computation of bounds for sender, recipient, and relationship anonymity on these calculations and show them to be grounded in ANOA. We present lightweight live-monitors that implement MATor for these anonymity notions.

In Section 6, we conduct experiments by applying MATor to Tor network data from the Tor Metrics archive [29]. These experiments provide insights into Tor’s anonymity guarantees, showing that they heavily depend on user preferences, the path selection algorithm, and the status of active Tor nodes. As depicted in Figure 1, these guarantees significantly fluctuate with every new consensus file, i.e., every hour. Our experiments also show that the current path selection algorithm does not properly distribute trust over Tor nodes and prioritizes a few high-bandwidth nodes.
