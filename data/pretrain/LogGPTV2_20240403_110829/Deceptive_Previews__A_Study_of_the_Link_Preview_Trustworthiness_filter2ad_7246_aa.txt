## Abstract
Social media has become a primary means of content and information sharing, thanks to its speed and simplicity. In this context, link previews play a crucial role by providing users with a meaningful first glance at the shared webpage through its title, description, and image. Our study examines the preview-rendering process, identifying how it can be misused to generate benign-looking previews for malicious links. This research is particularly relevant for understanding phishing and spam spread, including both targeted attacks and large-scale campaigns.

We conducted a series of experiments on 20 social media platforms, including social networks and instant messaging applications. Our findings reveal that most platforms follow their own preview design and format, sometimes providing only partial information. Four of these platforms allow the crafting of previews that can hide the malicious target even from tech-savvy users. For the remaining 16 platforms, we found that an attacker who can register their own domain can create misleading previews. Additionally, 18 of the 20 platforms do not employ active or passive countermeasures against the spread of known malicious links or software, and existing cross-checks on malicious URLs can be bypassed through client- and server-side redirections. Based on our findings, we propose seven recommendations to improve the overall preview-rendering mechanism and enhance users' trust in social media platforms.

## I. Introduction
The way Internet users access online information has changed dramatically. While search engines were once the primary means of discovering new content, today, users predominantly follow links distributed via social media platforms such as social networks and instant messaging apps. For example, about 40% of web traffic in 2017 originated from social networks [2], compared to 37% from Google searches [2]. When sharing a link, social platforms generate a user-friendly preview, often containing an image, a title, and a description extracted from the shared web page. These link previews are essential for engaging users by providing a meaningful overview of the page content and encouraging them to click for more information.

Unfortunately, the popularity of social platforms has attracted the attention of scammers and other malicious actors, who use these platforms to distribute malicious links, exposing users to a range of security risks, from online scams and spam to more severe threats like zero-day exploits (e.g., [3]). The security risks associated with visiting malicious web pages have been a focus of research for decades, covering detection techniques [13, 20], evaluation of defenses [22, 30, 21], and analysis of attacker behavior [16, 5]. Recently, the focus has shifted to understanding how these attacks have adapted to social platforms. Existing work has examined various aspects, including the pervasiveness of spam campaigns in social networks [32, 15], the infrastructure used by attackers [29], and the accounts spreading malicious content [35, 9]. Other studies have looked at the demographics of victims [27], showing that individual and community behaviors influence the likelihood of clicking on malicious links.

This paper investigates the problem of malicious link distribution by examining one of the key elements used by attackers to lure victims: link previews. Link previews synthesize the content of a web page, and anecdotal evidence suggests that they are a critical piece of information used by users to decide whether to click. For example, in 2017, Facebook prohibited users from modifying the content of link previews during post creation [28] to prevent the creation of deceptive previews [28]. Our study delves into the connection that previews create between users and the actual landing pages, aiming to provide a new interpretation of why social platform users click on malicious links.

Our investigation begins with a characterization of the link preview creation process across 20 popular social media platforms. We provide a comprehensive analysis covering three main aspects: the fields composing link previews, the layout of link previews, and the platforms' behavior when fetching web resources for a preview. After establishing a baseline, we test the platforms with malicious links to identify deviations and characterize any defense mechanisms. Finally, based on our observations, we demonstrate how an attacker can create effective malicious web pages that all 20 platforms display as benign-looking link previews. Specifically, on four platforms—Facebook, Xing, Plurk, and Slack—an attacker can stage such attacks by controlling the content of the web pages alone. We also show how to bypass existing countermeasures to avoid the detection of malicious URLs.

Our key findings include:
1. Seemingly innocuous behaviors in the preview-creation process can provide significant advantages to attackers. For example, on Facebook, an attacker can create a benign-looking link preview for a malicious web page, fooling even experienced and skilled users. Similar attacks are effective against other platforms like Xing, Plurk, and Slack.
2. The majority of tested platforms do not implement any countermeasures to prevent the sharing of malicious URLs. Only two platforms, Twitter and LinkedIn, implement such countermeasures, but they are improperly implemented, allowing attackers to bypass them with redirections.
3. The issues identified in our study are not merely technical and are not limited to a few social platforms. Instead, they represent a systematic problem affecting all platforms in the way they design and create previews. Our results show 14 distinct link preview layouts, each with several optional fields. Such variations may fail to help users establish trust with the previewed websites, leading them to overlook security-relevant signals and underestimate the security risks.
4. From our analysis, we distilled a list of seven recommendations, ranging from short-term technical solutions to the creation of a standard encoding for link preview content and rules for generating previews.

**Contributions:**
- We present the first comprehensive study and characterization of the link preview creation process across 20 popular social media platforms, detailing which fields are shown under different circumstances.
- We identify 14 distinct link preview templates and variants, highlighting the lack of consensus among platforms.
- We perform controlled experiments to determine the presence and effectiveness of existing countermeasures on social platforms, finding that all but two platforms do not implement any defense mechanisms, and those that do can be easily bypassed via redirections.
- We test the link preview creation in an adversarial setting, demonstrating that four out of 20 platforms can create benign-looking previews for malicious resources, fooling even experienced and skilled users.
- We distill seven recommendations for more robust and trustworthy link previews.

**Organization of the Paper:**
- **Section III:** Presents the general behavior of the social media platforms when posting a regular link, establishing a baseline for further observations and comparisons.
- **Section IV:** Repeats the link submission experiments with malicious content, discussing passive and active countermeasures employed by each platform.
- **Section V:** Examines the link preview creation under adversarial influence and presents our attacks.
- **Section VI:** Offers a set of recommendations and technical solutions.

## II. Background
Before presenting our study, we provide some foundational information. In Section II-A, we introduce the general framework used to generate a link preview. In Section II-B, we list the social media platforms selected for our evaluation. Finally, in Section II-C, we outline the threat model considered in our analysis.

### A. Sharing External Content on Social Media Platforms
Sharing text messages on social platforms, such as social networks, is typically straightforward: a user logs into the platform, types the message, and posts it. The message is then stored and delivered to friends when they update their timeline. When the message contains a URL, the platform retrieves the resources from the shared page to build a link preview. In theory, link previews can be created either by client-side programs (e.g., JavaScript) or server-side programs. However, due to the same-origin policy for cross-origin requests (SOP for CORS), most platforms cannot rely on client-side programs to fetch resources from third-party domains. Therefore, platforms tend to use server-side requests (SSRs).

Figure 1 illustrates the sequence of steps when sharing URLs on social platforms. The user accesses the social media platform through their browser or mobile app, types the URL in the input box, and shares it with friends or contacts (Step 1). The platform then performs SSRs to retrieve the URL and linked resources, such as images (Step 2). The platform processes these resources to create a preview for the webpage. The construction of the preview can be aided by additional HTML meta tags, such as Open Graph [11] by Facebook and Twitter Cards [37] by Twitter. Table I lists the meta tag types used to create previews for HTML content.

**Table I: Description of Meta Tags Used to Create Link Previews**

| Meta Tag Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| og:title      | The title of the article without any branding. |
| og:description | A brief description of the content. |
| og:image      | The URL of the image that appears in the preview. |
| og:url        | The canonical URL for the page, without session variables or user-identifying parameters. This URL is used to aggregate likes and shares. |
| twitter:title | The title of the article. |
| twitter:description | A brief description of the content. |
| twitter:image | The URL of the image that appears in the preview. |

### B. Case Studies
We conducted our study on 20 popular social media platforms, including ten social networks and ten instant messaging apps. In this section, we describe the selection criteria we used.

#### 1. Social Networks
We created an initial list of social networks by combining two sources. First, we manually inspected the Alexa Top 1M domains, retrieved in May 2019, and removed all non-social network websites. We then visited the remaining sites until we collected 30 social networks, with no pre-established cutoff on the domain rank value. We merged these 30 social network domains with an additional 30 domains ranked by the number of users, using the Wikipedia list [1] retrieved in July 2019. This resulted in a list of 47 social networks.

We manually inspected each of the 47 social networks and removed 37 of them for the following reasons: (i) social networks that no longer exist, (ii) inability to create user accounts, (iii) low Alexa ranking, (iv) lack of link-sharing support, (v) requirement for premium subscriptions, (vi) merging with already discarded networks, and (vii) posting prevented due to bot detection. Table II lists the 10 social networks used in our study.

#### 2. Instant Messaging Apps
We created the list of candidate instant messaging apps by crawling the first 32 apps in the "Communication" category of the Google Play store. We added six more popular apps (Instagram, Discord, Slack, Kik, Signal, and Snapchat) that were not initially included. This resulted in a list of 38 apps. We removed duplicates and then manually inspected each app, removing 18 of them for the following reasons: (i) not available in the Apple Store, (ii) lack of instant messaging function, (iii) no support for link previews, and (iv) low download numbers. Table II lists the 10 apps used in our study.

**Table II: List of Platforms**

| Social Network | Alexa Rank | App | Downloads |
|----------------|------------|-----|-----------|
| Facebook       | 3          | Instagram | 1,000,000,000+ |
| Twitter        | 11         | Messenger | 1,000,000,000+ |
| VK             | 15         | Skype     | 1,000,000,000+ |
| LinkedIn       | 23         | Snapchat  | 1,000,000,000+ |
| Pinterest      | 67         | WhatsApp  | 1,000,000,000+ |
| Tumblr         | 75         | Line      | 500,000,000+   |
| Medium         | 113        | Viber     | 500,000,000+   |
| Xing           | 1,294      | KakaoTalk | 100,000,000+   |
| Plurk          | 1,341      | Telegram  | 100,000,000+   |
| MeWe           | 5,142      | Slack     | 10,000,000+    |

### C. Threat Model
In this paper, we assume the best possible scenario for both the attacker and the victim, i.e., a strong attacker and a tech-savvy user.

**Attacker:**
The attacker aims to lure victims into visiting a malicious web page. The specific final attack delivered through the malicious page can vary based on the attacker's motivations. For example, an economically motivated attacker might use a phishing page to steal credit card numbers. We also consider highly motivated and powerful attackers, such as state-sponsored entities, who can use malicious pages to deliver zero-day exploits to compromise users' devices.

The attacker uses social media platforms to distribute the link to the malicious page. For example, on social networks, the attacker can register one or more accounts to direct the campaign. The attacker can also use stolen credentials to spread malicious links over a platform, including instant messaging systems. The goal is to post malicious links while remaining undetected by the platform's active or passive detection systems and misleading users who rely on the link preview to decide whether to click. To achieve this, the attacker creates a mismatch between the malicious content on the page and its benign-looking link preview by including specific meta tags in the code.

**Victim:**
The victim of these attacks can be a specific individual or a small group (targeted attack) or as many users as possible (indiscriminate attack). For our analysis, we consider skilled and experienced social network users, who are less likely to click on malicious URLs [27, 8, 17, 38].

## III. Characterizing Link Preview Creation
Link previews synthesize a web page, creating an expectation of what the user will see when they click on the preview. This section aims to shed light on how social media platforms create link previews. We analyze the content of previews for a set of test web pages, identifying the fields displayed and the conditions under which they appear. After presenting a comprehensive overview of link preview creation, we study the network traffic to retrieve the resources needed to build the link preview, looking for distinctive features that can be exploited.
