Abstract—Social media has become a primary mean of content
and information sharing, thanks to its speed and simplicity. In
this scenario, link previews play the important role of giving a
meaningful ﬁrst glance to users, summarizing the content of the
shared webpage within their title, description and image. In our
work, we analyzed the preview-rendering process, observing how
it is possible to misuse it to obtain benign-looking previews for
malicious links. Concrete use-case of this research ﬁeld is phishing
and spam spread, considering targeted attacks in addition to
large-scale campaigns.
We designed a set of experiments for 20 social media
platforms including social networks and instant messenger ap-
plications and found out how most of the platforms follow their
own preview design and format, sometimes providing partial
information. Four of these platforms allow preview crafting so
as to hide the malicious target even to a tech-savvy user, and
we found that it is possible to create misleading previews for the
remaining 16 platforms when an attacker can register their own
domain. We also observe how 18 social media platforms do not
employ active nor passive countermeasures against the spread of
known malicious links or software, and that existing cross-checks
on malicious URLs can be bypassed through client- and server-
side redirections. To conclude, we suggest seven recommendations
covering the spectrum of our ﬁndings, to improve the overall
preview-rendering mechanism and increase users’ overall trust
in social media platforms.

INTRODUCTION
The way Internet users access online information has
changed dramatically. While not so long ago, users relied
on search engines to ﬁnd new online content, nowadays
users predominantly follow links distributed over social media
platforms such as social networks and instant messaging to
discover web pages. For example, about 40% of web trafﬁc
in 2017 originated from social networks [2], against the 37%
share of Google searches [2]. When sharing a link, instead
of showing the raw URL string, social platforms prepare a
user-friendly preview often containing an image, a title, and a
description extracted from the shared web page. Link previews
play an important role to reach and engage Internet users
by providing a meaningful overview of the page content and
inviting users to click on them to access more information.

Unfortunately, the popularity of social platforms has at-
tracted the attention of scammers and other malicious users,
who use social platforms to distribute malicious links exposing
users to a plethora of security risks ranging from online scams
and spam to more concerning risks such as exploitation of
0-day vulnerabilities in mobile devices (see, i.e., [3]). The
security risks of visiting malicious web pages have been at
the center of the attention of the past decades of research
activities, focusing on, for example, detection techniques [13],
[20], evaluation of defenses (e.g., [22], [30], [21]), studying
the attacker behavior (e.g., [16], [5]), and detection of evasion
techniques (e.g., [39], [18]). Only recently, the attention has
shifted on studying the extent to which these attacks entered
and adapted to social platforms. Existing work has studied
different aspects such as the pervasiveness of spam campaigns
in social networks (e.g., [32], [15]), the infrastructure used by
attackers to distribute malicious pages [29], and the accounts
spreading malicious content (e.g., [35], [9]). Other lines of
works looked at the demographics of the victims (e.g., [27]),
showing that individual and communities behavior inﬂuence
the likelihood to click.
i.e.,
This paper looks at the problem of malicious link distribu-
tion by investigating one of the elements used by attackers
to draw the attention of the victims,
link previews.
Link previews synthesize the content of a web page, and
anecdotal evidence suggests that they are a fundamental piece
of information used by users to decide whether to click.
For example, in 2017, Facebook forbade users to modify the
content of link previews during the creation of posts [28] to
contain the creation of deceptive link previews to inﬂuence
user clicks [28]. This paper puts under the microscope the
connection that previews create between users and the actual
landing pages, with the overarching goal to provide a new
interpretation of the reasons why social platforms’ users click
on malicious links. Our investigation starts by delivering one
of the ﬁrst characterizations of the process of the link preview
creation of 20 popular social media platforms. We provide
a comprehensive analysis covering three relevant aspects, i.e.,
the ﬁelds composing link previews, the layout of link previews,
the platforms’ behavior when fetching the web resources of
a preview. Once established a behavioral baseline, we probe
social platforms with malicious links to determine devia-
tions from our baseline and characterizing—if any—platforms’
defense mechanisms. Finally, starting from the observations
collected during our investigation, we show how an attacker
can create in practice effective malicious web pages that all
our 20 platforms display as benign-looking link previews. In
particular, in four of them, i.e., Facebook, Xing, Plurk and
Slack, an attacker can stage such attacks by controlling the
content of the web pages only. Finally, we show how to bypass
existing countermeasures to avoid the detection of malicious
URLs.
This paper makes the following key ﬁndings. First, we
discovered seemingly innocuous behaviors when creating pre-
views that provide a great advantage to an attacker. For exam-
ple, on Facebook, an attacker can create a benign-looking link
preview of a malicious web page, fooling even experienced
and skilled Internet users. Similar attacks are effective against
other platforms too, such as Xing, Plurk, and Slack. Second,
the vast majority of the tested platforms do not implement
any countermeasure that prevents sharing malicious URLs.
Only two platforms (Twitter and LinkedIn) implement such
countermeasures and, sadly, they are improperly implemented,
allowing an attacker to bypass them with redirections. Third,
the shortcomings identiﬁed by our study are not merely techni-
cal issues and are not limited to a few social platforms. Instead,
we present a systematic problem affecting all platforms in the
ways they design and create previews. Our results show 14
distinct link preview layouts, each with several optional ﬁelds.
Such a large number of variations may fail to help users in
establishing trust with the previewed web sites. As a result,
users may overlook security-relevant signals and underestimate
the security risks of the previewed page, exposing themselves
to a plethora of web attacks. Finally, from the analysis of our
results, we distilled a list of seven recommendations, ranging
from short-term solutions to the technical shortcoming, to the
creation of a standard encoding for the content of link previews
and the rules to create them.
Contributions — To summarize, this paper makes the follow-
ing contributions:
• We present the ﬁrst comprehensive study and charac-
terization of the link preview creation process of 20
popular social media platforms, showing which ﬁeld
is shown under what circumstances;
• We present 14 distinct link preview templates and
variants across all platforms, indicating the lack of
consensus among all platforms;
• We perform a set of controlled experiments to de-
termine the presence of existing countermeasures on
social platforms, showing that all except for two
platforms do not implement any defense mechanism.
Furthermore, we perform additional tests to determine
their effectiveness, discovering that the two counter-
measures can be easily bypassed via redirections;
• We test the link preview creation in an adversarial
setting, showing that four platforms out of 20 can cre-
ate benign-looking previews for malicious resources,
fooling even experienced and skilled users;
From our results, we distill 7 recommendations to-
wards more robust and trustworthy link previews;

experiments providing the platforms with malicious content,
i.e., blacklisted links or known malware. We present con-
siderations on passive and active countermeasures employed
by each social media platform. Section V presents the link
preview creation under adversarial inﬂuence and presents our
attacks. Finally, Section VI presents a set of recommendations
and technical solutions.
II. BACKGROUND
Before presenting the study of this paper, we introduce
building block information. In Section II-A, we start by
introducing the general framework used to generate a link
preview, and then, in Section II-B, we present the list of social
media platforms that we selected for our evaluation. Finally,
in Section II-C, we introduce the threat model considered in
our analysis.
A. Sharing External Content on Social Media Platforms
Sharing text messages on social platforms, such as social
networks, is usually a straightforward process: a user logs into
the platform, types the message, and posts it. The message is
then stored and delivered to all friends when they update their
timeline. When the message contains a URL, the platform re-
trieves the resources in the shared page to build a link preview.
In theory, link previews can be created either by the client-side
program (e.g., Javascript) or the server-side programs. How-
ever, as URLs often originate from third-party domains, most
platforms cannot rely on the client-side programs because the
same-origin policy for cross-origin requests (SOP for CORs)
prevents the client-side programs from fetching resources from
other origins by default. Accordingly, platforms tend to use
server-side requests [25] (SSRs).
Figure 1 shows the sequence of steps when sharing URLs
on social platforms. The user accesses the social media plat-
form through their browser, or through a mobile app, and then
types the URL in the input box to share the URL content
with friends or contacts (Step 1 Figure 1). Then, the platform
performs a number of SSRs to retrieve the URL and the linked
resources, e.g., images (Step 2 Figure 1). Then, the platform
processes the collected resources to create a preview for the
webpage. The construction of the preview can be aided with
a set of additional HTML meta tags specifying suggested
content for each ﬁeld of the preview, such as the page title
and page description. Two popular meta tags languages are

B. Case Studies
We conduct the study of this paper on 20 popular social
media platforms, ten of which are social networks, and ten are
instant messaging apps. In this section, we present the selection
criteria we used.
1) Social Networks: We created an initial list of social
networks by combining two sources. First, we manually in-
spected the Alexa Top 1M domains, retrieved in May 2019,
and removed all the websites which do not fall under the Social
Network category (e.g. amazon.com); then, we manually vis-
ited the remaining ones until we collected 30 social networks,
with no pre-established cutoff on the domain rank value. Then,
we merged the 30 social network domains from the Alexa Top
1M domains with additional 30 domains of social networks
ranked by the number of users. For this ranking, we used
the list maintained by Wikipedia1, retrieved on July 2019.
Then, from these 60 social networks, we removed duplicates
obtaining a list of 47 social networks.
We inspected each of the 47 social networks manually,
and removed 37 of them for one of the following reasons: (i)
1See, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of social networking websites
3
social networks that no longer exist, (ii) we were unable to
create user accounts2, (iii) the social network is ranked too
low in the Alexa Top 1M, (iv) platforms that do not support
link sharing (e.g., Soundcloud), (v) platforms that require
Premium subscriptions, (vi) social networks that merged with
already discarded ones, and (vii) posting prevented due to bot
detection. Table II lists the 10 social networks that we used
for the study of this paper.
2) Instant Messaging Apps: We created the list of candidate
instant messaging apps by crawling the ﬁrst 32 apps in order of
appearance from the category “Communication” of the Google
Play store. To these samples, we added six more apps (i.e.,
Instagram, Discord, Slack, Kik, Signal, and Snapchat), that we
considered popular but not part of the initial list. From these
38 apps, we removed duplicates obtaining a list of 28 instant
messaging apps. Then, we inspected each app manually and
removed 18 of them for the following reasons: (i) not available
in the Apple Store3, (ii) no instant messaging function, (iii) link
previews not supported, and (iv) a low number of downloads.
Table II lists the 10 apps we used for the study of this paper.
C. Threat Model
We now present the threat model of this paper. In this paper,
we assume the best scenario possible for both the attacker and
the victim, i.e., a strong attacker and a tech-savvy user.
Attacker — The attacker of this paper intends to lure their
victims into visiting a malicious web page. The speciﬁc ﬁnal
attack delivered with the malicious page can vary, based on
the motivations of the attacker. For example, an attacker with
economic interest may want to steal credit card numbers with a
phishing page. In this paper, we also consider highly-motivated
powerful attackers such as state-sponsored attackers that can
use malicious pages to deliver 0-day exploits to compromise
users’ device.
The attacker uses social media platforms to distribute the
link to the malicious page. For example, in the case of social
the attacker can register one or more accounts
networks,
to direct
the campaign. The attacker can also use stolen
credentials to spread malicious links over a platform, including
instant messaging systems. Their goal is to post malicious links
2The main reason was the language barrier. Then, even when using
automated translation and help from a native speaker (Chinese), we were
deemed to be a robot or a non-trusted user, and denied access to the platform.
We would speculate this occurred because our mobile phone numbers were
not Chinese or because of the geo-location of our IPs.
3We ignored apps that are not in the Apple Store because of our testing
setting (See Section III). We used one iPhone device and one Android device:
one for the user sharing a link, and the other for the user clicking on the link
preview.

while, on the one hand, being undetected by possible active or
passive detection systems put in place by the hosting platform
and, on the other hand, misleading the users, who make use
of the link preview to decide whether to click. To this end, the
attacker creates a mismatch between the malicious content in
the page and its benign-looking link preview, by including in
the attacker’s code speciﬁc meta tags.
Victim — The victim of these attacks can be a speciﬁc
individual or small group of individuals (i.e., targeted attack),
or as many users as possible, indiscriminately. For the analysis
of this paper, we consider skilled and experienced social
network users—a category of users who is less prone to click
on malicious URLs [27], [8], [17], [38].
III. CHARACTERIZING LINK PREVIEW CREATION
In essence, link previews synthesize a web page, creating
the expectation on what the user would see when clicking
on the preview. The analysis of this section intends to shed
some light on the ways social media platforms create link
previews. This analysis reviews the content of previews of a
set of test web pages, and identiﬁes precisely the ﬁelds that are
displayed and under which circumstances. After presenting a
comprehensive overview of link preview creation, our analysis
studies the network trafﬁc to retrieve the resources to build
the link preview, looking for distinctive features that can be
