uses 
the
transmission link, and signing  and  classification  marking
by  the  person  placing  the  object  on  the  web  server.  The
arbitration  server  allows  users  access  only  to  those  web
servers  they  have  permission  to  access.  This  allows
the  session, 
communities of interest within the enclave. Placing items
on  web  servers  passes  through  the  same  two  layers  of
encryption  as  browsing.  Again,  the  arbitration  server
verifies  access  rights  to  post  objects.  Additionally,  the
web  server  itself  also  verifies  that  user  has  the  correct
permissions to post objects to the web. Items posted to the
internal  enclave  web  servers  are  also  digitally  signed  by
the  user  posting  the  object.  Applications  accessing  the
enclave  (web  browsers,  ftp,  and  telnet)  must  be  public
key/digital signature “aware” and verify the signatures on
objects  and  compare  them  with  the  originator’s  digital
signature as a “double check.”
To  explain  the  enclave  access  arrangement  in  greater
detail,  assume  there  are  five  states,  New  York  (NY),
Illinois  (IL),  West  Virginia  (WV),  Virginia  (VA),  and
South Carolina (SC). States NY, IL, and WV all currently
belong  to  the  alliance.  NY  is  currently  conducting  an
exercise with IL; NY is also providing WV with real-world
intelligence  about  SC,  a  non-alliance
border  clash 
member.  VA  belongs  to  the  alliance,  but  is  actively  is
encouraging  outsider  SC  against  alliance  member  WV.
Additionally, VA passed classified alliance information to
SC. As a result, the alliance leadership decided to remove
VA’s  full  ANA  privileges,  with  the  exception  of  email
because they hope to use VA to mediate with SC about the
border  clash.  Table  4  shows  the  access  privileges  each
country has within the ANA based upon this scenario.

Based upon the Table 4 privileges, the different guards
and  servers  in  the  enclave  can  be  configured  to  provide
services  to  the  appropriate  users  and  countries.  Table  5
maps the privileges in Table 4 to services and certificates
issued  or  denied  in  an  enclave.  Services  provided  are
identical to those privileges allowed in Table 4.

Table 5—Alliance Network Area Connections Allowed by PKI Guards and Servers
U.S.-only  SIPRNET  users  are  not  allowed  carte
blanche  privileges  in  the  enclave.  SIPRNET  users  are
required  to  have  the  correct  authentication,  assurances,
and  training  to  enter  the  Alliance  Network,  just  like  any
other  ANA  user.  All  web-browsing  and  posting  is
conducted through the guards with the assurances and web
object  signatures  discussed  earlier.  All  email  traffic  is
signed  by  the  sender  for  authentication  purposes  and
encrypted  for  security  purposes.  Given  the  level  of
protection provided by this architecture, allowing enclave
guards to service multiple SIPRNET domains from more
than one local area may be feasible.
The  organization  controlling  the  arbitration  server
obviously  has  complete  control  of  all  objects—both
machines  and  files—within  the  enclave.  While  this
centralization of authority can cause problems, this can be
mitigated  by  policy.  Additionally,  there  can  be  multiple
enclaves (see Section 4.4), each with the arbitration server
for that enclave under the control of the enclave’s physical
owner.

4.3. Revoking Keys and Access
One of the problems with the Euro-centric networks is
removing  users  and  organizations  from  the  network.
Currently,  the  only  way  to  do  this  is  to  change  the
cryptographic keys or shut down the communications link.
Neither method is trivial. Access to the entire ANA can be
denied  by  simply  refusing  individual  connections  at  the
enclave  guard  by  either  locking  the  individual’s  ANA
account or revoking the rights of their public/private  key
pairings. National level connections can be refused either
in  the  same  manner,  by  revoking  the  national  groups’
privileges,  or  by  changing  the  hardware  link  encryption
variables  (in  the  example  this  was  a  Virtual  Private
Network).
The ability to disconnect individuals or national groups
from  portions  of  the  ANA  while  continuing  to  allow
access to other ANA components rests with the user/group
accounts  manager  at  the  arbitration  server.    Limiting
existing  services  with  the  arbitration  server  consists  of
removing  access  privileges  to  specific  machines  (each
serving a separate community of interest) from the user or
national  group.    The  next  time  a  newly  restricted  user
requests  a  token  for  an  “off  limits”  from  the  arbitration
server, the request is denied.
An individual user in a particular country may belong
to  several  communities  of  interest  in  the  ANA.  The
individual must have a unique hardware token, userid, and
password(s) to gain access to the enclave. Revoking some
privileges  may  not  completely  remove  the  user  from  the
system. Removing a country from access to the ANA will
remove all of that country’s users. However, once a user’s
or  country’s  privileges  are  disabled  does  not  mean  they
cannot be reinstated later using the same keys, particularly
if  the  revocation  was  done  at  the  user/national  group
account level.
4.4. Communications Infrastructure for the
Alliance Network
The  network  and  security  architecture  presented  in
Sections 4.2 and 4.3 detail the basic security arrangements
within  the  Alliance  Network  Area  and  the  requirements
for  users  to  gain  access  to  the  alliance  area.  It  does  not
discuss how different ANA nodes communicate with one
another  or  the  user’s  communications  path  from  their
work area to an  ANA. There are two  ways to physically
reach an ANA node. First, the alliance network can have a
separate,  encrypted,  communications  backbone.  This  is
the current method, is very secure, and relatively difficult
to  attack  from  outside  the  network  except  through
physical  infrastructure  attacks.  It  has  the  drawback  of
being  relatively  expensive.  The  ANA  proposed  in  this
paper  does  cost  less  than  the  current  method  because  it
allows a single connection to a multi-level enclave instead
of requiring many bilateral connections.
The  second  technique  is  to  exploit  the  commercial
Internet.  This  is  not  commonly  done  now  because  it  is
difficult to control where packets pass while they traverse
the  Internet.  For  example,  packets  passing  between  two
countries  may  conceivably  pass  through  a  non-ANA
country. Internet based systems are also  more vulnerable
to  denial  of  service  attacks  than  separate  backbone
systems.  However,  by  using 
the  proper  encryption
techniques, the Internet may be used at a greatly reduced
financial  cost  than  a  dedicated  network.  This  was  done
recently during operations in East Timor [13].
5. Conclusion
This  paper  presents  the  requirements  for  an  alliance
network that does not require all alliance  members to be
treated  as  peers,  and  that  also  provides  separate,  private
communities  within  the  network.  The  network  does  this
using  a  combination  of  symmetric  and  asymmetric
encryption 
technology  and  existing  or  developing
equipment. The proposed alliance network can provide a
currently  unachieved  level  of  interoperability  between
foreign  classified  networks  and  U.S.-only  classified
networks.
There  are  several  problems  with  the  architecture
proposed  in  Section  4.2.  First.  the  proposed  architecture
proposed 
in  Section  4.2  must  be  fully  reviewed,
accredited, and approved. These review and accreditation
problems  aside,  there  are  several  other  technical  and
administrative  problems  that  must  be  addressed.  For
example, there is the purely technical problem of writing
enclave aware applications to administer and transfer files
to machines located within an Alliance Network Area. For
example,  if  a  user  wants  to  remotely  transfer  a  file  to  a
web  server  today,  she  uses  the  File  Transfer  Protocol
(FTP) to log into the server and copy the file to the server.
FTP  programs  that  can  negotiate  through  enclave  guards
do  not  currently  exist.  Similar  problems  hold  for  Telnet
and  other  remote  administrative  tools.  These  technical
problems  can  be  solved  and  do  not  pose  a  significant
problem.
The  administration  and  management  of  a  network
using  both  symmetric  and  asymmetric  encryption  is
daunting. Using HPED technology  requires  every  person
to  have  an  individual  hardware  token  with  all  of  the
appropriate  certificates.  For  example,  if  a  user  is  a
command  center  watch  officer  and  an  official  message
release authority, both require additional certificates to be
issued.  Quickly  expanding 
the  number  of  properly
equipped HPED users in a crisis may not be an option, so
the enclave system needs to be established in peacetime.
Despite 
these  problems, 
the  alliance  architecture
proposed in Section 4.2 (or something similar to it) needs
to  be  established  for  tomorrow’s  military  commanders.
Current  systems  do  not  provide  the  interoperability
required  between  multi-national  forces  that  we  need  on
the  battlefield.  The  advantage  to  any  vendor  developing
these systems is that all the systems described herein have
clear  commercial  value  as  well.  The  enclave  guards,
arbitration  servers,  and  public  key  aware  administration
tools  can  all  be  used  immediately  in  the  private  sector.
Because  of  the  dual  utility,  the  author  hopes  researchers
and  commercial  firms  will  develop  commercial  versions
of these devices which the military can use to implement
improved alliance networks.
