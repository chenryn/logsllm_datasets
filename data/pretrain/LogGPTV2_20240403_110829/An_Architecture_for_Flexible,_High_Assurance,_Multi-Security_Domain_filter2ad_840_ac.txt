### Proposed Alliance Network

The proposed alliance network is designed with three layers of encryption to ensure secure web browsing. Users must go through the transmission link, which includes signing and classification marking by the person placing the object on the web server. The arbitration server controls access, allowing users to access only those web servers they have permission to view. This ensures that communities of interest within the enclave are maintained.

When placing items on web servers, the same two layers of encryption are used as in browsing. The arbitration server verifies access rights to post objects, and the web server itself checks the user's permissions. Items posted to internal enclave web servers are also digitally signed by the user. Applications accessing the enclave (web browsers, FTP, and Telnet) must be PKI-aware and verify signatures on objects, comparing them with the originator’s digital signature as a "double check."

### Enclave Access Arrangement

To illustrate the enclave access arrangement, consider five states: New York (NY), Illinois (IL), West Virginia (WV), Virginia (VA), and South Carolina (SC). States NY, IL, and WV are part of the alliance. NY is conducting an exercise with IL and providing real-world intelligence about SC, a non-alliance member, to WV. VA, while part of the alliance, is actively encouraging SC against WV and has passed classified information to SC. As a result, VA's full ANA privileges were revoked, except for email, to facilitate mediation with SC.

| State | Email (all types, classified and unclassified) | Unclassified Web Server | Alliance General Purpose Classified Web Server | Alliance Exercise Web Server | Alliance Real-World Border Clash Web Server |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| NY    | Valid                                           | Valid                   | Valid                                          | Valid                        | Valid                                        |
| IL    | Valid                                           | Valid                   | Valid                                          | Valid                        | Valid                                        |
| WV    | Valid                                           | Valid                   | Valid                                          | Valid                        | Valid                                        |

### Configuration of Guards and Servers

Based on the privileges in Table 4, the guards and servers in the enclave can be configured to provide services to the appropriate users and countries. Table 5 maps these privileges to services and certificates issued or denied.

#### Table 5: Services and Certificates
| Service Provided | Users Allowed | Users Denied |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Email            | NY, IL, WV, VA | SC           |
| Unclassified Web Server | NY, IL, WV, VA | VA, SC      |
| General Purpose Classified Web Server | NY, IL, WV | VA, SC   |
| Exercise Web Server | NY, IL, WV | VA, SC       |
| Border Clash Web Server | NY, IL | WV, VA, SC   |

### Security and Access Control

U.S.-only SIPRNET users do not have carte blanche privileges in the enclave. They must have the correct authentication, assurances, and training to enter the Alliance Network. All web browsing and posting are conducted through the guards with the necessary assurances and web object signatures. Email traffic is signed by the sender for authentication and encrypted for security.

The organization controlling the arbitration server has complete control over all objects within the enclave. While this centralization can cause issues, it can be mitigated by policy. Multiple enclaves can exist, each with its own arbitration server under the control of the physical owner.

### Revoking Keys and Access

One challenge with Euro-centric networks is removing users and organizations. Currently, this requires changing cryptographic keys or shutting down the communications link. In the ANA, access can be denied by refusing individual connections at the enclave guard, either by locking the account or revoking key pairings. National-level connections can be refused similarly or by changing hardware link encryption variables.

The ability to disconnect individuals or national groups from parts of the ANA while allowing access to other components lies with the user/group accounts manager at the arbitration server. Limiting services involves removing specific machine access privileges. If a newly restricted user requests a token for an "off-limits" service, the request is denied.

An individual may belong to multiple communities of interest in the ANA, requiring unique hardware tokens, user IDs, and passwords. Revoking some privileges may not completely remove the user. Removing a country's access will remove all its users, but privileges can be reinstated later using the same keys.

### Communications Infrastructure

The network and security architecture detail the basic security arrangements within the ANA and the requirements for access. There are two ways to physically reach an ANA node:

1. **Separate, Encrypted Communications Backbone**: This method is very secure but expensive.
2. **Exploiting the Commercial Internet**: This is less secure but more cost-effective, especially with proper encryption techniques.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the requirements for an alliance network that does not treat all members as peers and provides separate, private communities. The network uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption and existing or developing equipment. The proposed alliance network can provide a high level of interoperability between foreign and U.S.-only classified networks.

While there are technical and administrative challenges, such as writing enclave-aware applications and managing encryption, these can be addressed. The proposed architecture needs to be established for future military commanders, as current systems lack the required interoperability for multinational forces.
