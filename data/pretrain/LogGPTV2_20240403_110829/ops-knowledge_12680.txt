User: I run a lot of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. For many reasons, I would like to write a program which will monitor the output of the log file given by the CFD solver and adjust its control parameters accordingly. I have a few ideas but would like to ask for advice as to what would be the best way to do this.
My thoughts:

could run the program constantly and import the convergence parameters at a fixed time interval or when the log file changes
could use some system or platform specific utilities to monitor the CFD process
the CFD runs in parallel on the same machine so (probably) will need a way to control the parallel processes (the CFD code I'm using is OpenFOAM which utilises OpenMPI to parallelise its processes)

For completeness, I run on Ubuntu 12.04 and would prefer the program to be written in C/C++ or alternatively Python.
Thanks a lot
Assistant: If it were me, I'd try to change the CFD code to be a library instead of an application, and then I'd expose it to Python.  Then I'd write a Python script that would invoke the library and get the results, iterating as needed.  If the CFD code doesn't take very long to run a single iteration, this will be more efficient than launching the CFD standalone program over and over.  And perhaps more importantly it will allow exchange of rich data between the CFD code and the supervisor, rather than only text files.
