In the React context, when building an app I'm used to the concept of
containers and components. It appears to me that "pages" are somewhat
equivalent to containers within next.js.
Is there a recommended way to add an application layout container such that I
could specify for example global `` and `` components with
the router determining which content to display within (the page)? Similar to
how the popular `react-router` package `match` function can be configured on
the server.
Using the next.js default router and pages folder as is, to achieve this do I
have no option but to duplicate `` and `` across all pages?
