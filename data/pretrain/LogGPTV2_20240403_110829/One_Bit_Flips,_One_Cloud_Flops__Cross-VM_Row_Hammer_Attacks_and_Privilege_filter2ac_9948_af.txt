also heavily relying on PV guests in their public cloud
services. In addition, PVMs are also the primary virtual-
ization substrate in free academic clouds like Cloudlab10.
The prevalence of PV guests provides adversaries op-
portunities to perform bit detection, and hence double-
sided row hammer attacks in public clouds. With de-
tected bit ﬂips, it also allows malicious page table manip-
ulation to enable arbitrary cross-VM memory accesses.
This kind of hardware attack is beyond control of the hy-
pervisor. Victims will suffer from direct impairment of
the system integrity or more sophisticated exploits of the
vulnerability from attackers.

Then the adversary resumed the login process by en-
tering password to decrypt the private key. The private
key was incorrect so this step would fail anyway. Then
password authentication would be used as a fallback au-
thentication method, in which the adversary can log in
the server with any password, because it was not really
checked by the server.
Again, the time to complete the OpenSSH attack de-
pends on the number of physical pages scanned before
meeting the targeted one. If the target physical page is
the ﬁrst to be examined by the adversary, the average
time to complete the attack was 0.322s, which included
the time to manipulate page tables, conduct row hammer
attacks to induce the desired bit ﬂip, search the target
page for speciﬁc patterns, and inject code in the target

The
Row hammer resistance with hardware-assisted vir-
tualization. Many of the attacks presented in this pa-
per (e.g., bit detection, double-sided row hammering,
and also cross-VM memory accesses enabled by page
table manipulation) require the adversary to know the
machine address of his virtual memory. One way to
prevent physical address disclosure to guest VMs is to
adopt hardware-assisted virtualization, such as Intel’s
VT-x [31] and AMD’s AMD-V [2]. Particularly, VT-x
employs Extended Page Tables and AMD-V introduces
Nested Page Tables [1] to accelerate the processor’s ac-
cesses to two layers of page tables, one controlled by the
guest VM and the other controlled by the hypervisor. In
this way, the guest VMs may no longer observe the real
physical addresses, as they are not embedded in the PTEs
any more. Hardware-assisted virtualization also prevents
direct manipulation of page tables, and thus the privilege
escalation attacks presented in this paper are not feasible.
transition from Xen paravirtualization to
hardware-assisted virtualization in public clouds started
a few years ago, but the progress has been very slow.
One reason is that paravirtualization used to have better
performance than hardware-assisted virtualization in
terms of networking and storage [9]. However, with the
recent advances in hardware-assisted virtualization tech-
nology, some HVM-based cloud instances (especially
PV on HVM) are considered having comparable, if not
better, performance [7]. Even so, given the prevalence
of paravirtualization in public clouds as of today, we
anticipate it will take many years before such technology
can gradually phase out. We hope our study offers to the
community motivation to accelerate such trends.
Row hammer resistance with ECC-enabled DRAMs.
As discussed in Section 2, the most commonly imple-
mented ECC mechanism is single error-correction, dou-
ble error-detection. Therefore, it can correct only one
single-bit of errors within a 64-bit memory block, and
detect (but not correct) 2-bit errors, causing the machines
to crash. ECC memory will make the row hammer at-
tacks much harder. Because 1-bit error and 2-bit er-
rors are more common than multi-bit errors (e.g., see
Figure 13c), and it is very likely the privilege escalation
attack will be thwarted either by bit correction or ma-
chine crashes before it succeeds. However, ECC mem-
ory does not offer strong security guarantees against row
hammer attacks11. It is still possible for an adversary to
trigger multiple (> 3) bit ﬂips in the same 64-bit word
so that errors can be silently induced and later exploited.
Particularly, if the true physical address of an extremely
vulnerable rows is known to the adversary, hammering
around this speciﬁc row will greatly increase the adver-

machines are also susceptible to row hammer attacks [24].
sary’s chances of success.
We believe a combination of hardware and software
based defense will offer better security against row ham-
mer attacks. On the one hand, hardware protection raises
the bar of conducting row hammer attacks, and on the
other hand, software isolation prevents successful ex-
ploitation once such vulnerability is found by the adver-
sary.
8 Conclusion
In conclusion, we explored in this paper row hammer at-
tacks in the cross-VM settings, and successfully demon-
strated software attacks that exploit row hammer vul-
nerabilities to break memory isolation in virtualization.
Many techniques presented in this paper are novel: Our
graph-based bit detection algorithm can reliably deter-
mine row bits and XOR-schemes that are used to deter-
mine bank bits within one or two minutes. This novel
method enables the construction of double-sided attacks,
which signiﬁcantly improves the ﬁdelity of the attacks.
The page table replacement attacks present a determinis-
tic exploitation of row hammer vulnerabilities. The two
examples we demonstrated in the paper, private key exﬁl-
tration from an HTTPS web server and code injection to
bypass password authentication on an OpenSSH server,
illustrate the power of the presented cross-VM row ham-
mer attacks. The high-level takeaway message from this
paper can be summarized as: (1) Row hammer attacks
can be constructed to effectively induce bit ﬂips in vul-
nerable memory chips, and (2) cross-VM exploitation of
row hammer vulnerabilities enables a wide range of se-
curity attacks. We also believe that although server-grade
processors and memory chips are more expensive and in
contrast are less vulnerable to row hammer attacks, se-
curity guarantees needs to be achieved by both hardware
and software solutions.
