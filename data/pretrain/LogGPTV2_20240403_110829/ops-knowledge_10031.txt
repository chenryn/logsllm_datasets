Question: "A cybersecurity analyst is reviewing network traffic to identify potential command and control (C2) channels used by adversaries. The analyst wants to implement a detection method that focuses on analyzing packet contents to identify mismatches between the expected protocol behavior and the port being used. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of this approach?"
 "A": "Advantage: It can identify traffic for specific adversary malware. Disadvantage: It may result in a high number of false positives due to legitimate use of non-standard ports."
 "B": "Advantage: It ensures no non-standard port traffic is allowed in the network. Disadvantage: It may block legitimate traffic leading to business disruptions."
 "C": "Advantage: It does not require any additional resources. Disadvantage: It cannot detect sophisticated attacks that use standard port-protocol pairings."
 "D": "Advantage: It can detect communications that do not follow expected protocol behavior. Disadvantage: It may not detect all C2 communications, as some may occur over standard ports."
Answer: AD
