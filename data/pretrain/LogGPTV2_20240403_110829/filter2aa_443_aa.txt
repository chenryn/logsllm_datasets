## Introduction to Remote Active OS Fingerprinting

**Remote Active OS Fingerprinting** is the process of actively determining a targeted network node’s underlying operating system by probing the target with specific packets and analyzing the responses, or lack thereof.

- **Traditional Approach**: Examines the TCP/IP stack behavior (IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols) of a targeted network element when probed with legitimate and/or malformed packets.
- **Comparison to Signature Database**: The received results are compared to a signature database to find an appropriate match.
- **Layers Involved**: Not limited to IP and Transport layers; the Application layer can also provide valuable information about the underlying OS.

### Key Points

- **Variability in Tools**: Different tools use varying methods, packet types, and numbers of packets.
- **Importance**: Identifying the underlying OS is crucial for network inventory, intrusion detection, and vulnerability analysis.

## Strengths of Remote Active OS Fingerprinting

- **Control Over Parameters**: Customizable stimulus for scanning.
- **Pace and Initiation Control**: Flexible scan initiation and pacing.
- **Fast Results**: Quick turnaround for results.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Can scan entire IP address ranges.
- **Multi-Point Scanning**: Effective from a single point to multiple points or vice versa.

## Weaknesses of Remote Active OS Fingerprinting

### Scanning Conditions and Environmental Effects

- **Quality of Scan**: Directly influenced by the environment, including the location of the scanning and target systems, and the path between them (e.g., firewalls, load balancers).
- **Lack of Intelligence**: Limited ability to adapt to environmental changes and interpret results.

### Network Obstacles

- **Packet Blocking**: Network firewalls, host-based firewalls, NAT-enabled devices, and other obstacles can block probe packets, leading to false or no results.
- **Packet Alteration**: Networking devices may alter packet fields, affecting the accuracy of OS identification.

### Use of Crafted/Malformed Packets

- **Filtering Devices**: May drop malformed packets, degrading the quality of results.
- **TCP/IP Stack Crashes**: Malformed packets can cause some TCP/IP stacks to crash.

### Altered TCP/IP Stack Behavior

- **Tunable Parameters**: Changes in TCP/IP stack parameters can affect the accuracy of fingerprinting.
- **Patches and Modifications**: Open-source OS kernels often have patches that alter TCP/IP stack behavior.

### Signature Database Issues

- **Database Quality**: The accuracy of the results depends on the quality and maintenance of the signature database.
- **Signature Production**: Signatures must be produced in a controlled environment to ensure accuracy.
- **Controlled vs. Loosely Controlled Databases**:
  - **Strictly Controlled**: Verified signatures, slower updates, highly accurate.
  - **Loosely Controlled**: Unverified signatures, faster updates, less accurate.

### Fingerprinting Targets

- **Software-Based Systems**: Fingerprint the OS's reaction to probes.
- **Hardware-Based Devices**: Fingerprint the firmware's reaction to probes.
- **Challenges**: Many tools do not account for the variability in hardware-based devices, leading to corrupted databases.

### Implementation of New Fingerprinting Tests

- **DB Updates**: New tests require updates to the signature database.
- **Uncontrolled DBs**: Cannot handle new tests, leading to inconsistent signature quality.

## Conclusion

Remote active OS fingerprinting is a powerful tool for network security, but it comes with its own set of challenges. Understanding these strengths and weaknesses is essential for effective and accurate OS identification. The new version of Xprobe2 (Xprobe2 v0.3) aims to address some of these issues and improve the overall accuracy and reliability of OS fingerprinting.
