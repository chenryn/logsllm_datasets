# Feature request
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
My use case is that we have a 1MB json file that is needed to render the page.
No problem on the server, but we don't want to send this data to client from
getInitialProps as it'll make the pagesize huge.
So, we want to SSR initially, then load the JSON file via ajax on the client
and only then trigger the initial client-side hydration/render once the file
has loaded.
## Describe the solution you'd like
A way to supply a promise to next/client that can awaited before the client-
side hydration takes place.
## Describe alternatives you've considered
If we cannot wait to delay the render, the initial SSR completes, then we have
to replace it with a loading spinner on the client side while the file
finishes loading. That's obviously not ideal, as it means that:
  * The content renders server-side.
  * Then it disappears on the client initial render, replaced by a spinner.
  * And then returns as before, on a client later render after the file has loaded.
You can imagine how that gives a pretty confusing experience for the user.
I've got it working by either:
  * Directly adding another await call inside the next/client/index render method in node_modules
  * Using a hacky innerHTML workaround (see comment below),
Both these ways have problems, and so I'd prefer a real solution.
## Additional context
I'm happy to do a PR if you can suggest me on the right approach to take.
