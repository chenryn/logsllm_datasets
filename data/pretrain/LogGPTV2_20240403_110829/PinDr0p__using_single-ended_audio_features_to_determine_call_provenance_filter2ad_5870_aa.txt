ABSTRACT
The recent diversiﬁcation of telephony infrastructure allows users
to communicate through landlines, mobile phones and VoIP phones.
However, call metadata such as Caller-ID is either not transferred
or transferred without veriﬁcation across these networks, allowing
attackers to maliciously alter it. In this paper, we develop PinDr0p,
a mechanism to assist users in determining call provenance — the
source and the path taken by a call. Our techniques detect and mea-
sure single-ended audio features to identify all of the applied voice
codecs, calculate packet loss and noise proﬁles, while remaining
agnostic to characteristics of the speaker’s voice (as this may le-
gitimately change when interacting with a large organization). In
the absence of veriﬁable call metadata, these features in combina-
tion with machine learning allow us to determine the traversal of
a call through as many as three different providers (e.g., cellular,
then VoIP, then PSTN and all combinations and subsets thereof)
with 91.6% accuracy. Moreover, we show that once we identify
and characterize the networks traversed, we can create detailed ﬁn-
gerprints for a call source. Using these ﬁngerprints we show that
we are able to distinguish between calls made using speciﬁc PSTN,
cellular, Vonage, Skype and other hard and soft phones from loca-
tions across the world with over 90% accuracy. In so doing, we
provide a ﬁrst step in accurately determining the provenance of a
call.

INTRODUCTION
The current telephony infrastructure allows users to communi-
cate using a variety of technologies. Circuit switched landlines
continue to provide telephony to the majority of homes and busi-
nesses. Mobile phones now offer service to more than four billion
users [54]. Voice over IP (VoIP) allows users to inexpensively com-
municate with each other irrespective of the geographical distances,
with systems such as Skype [10] currently serving over 400 million
users [8]. Each of these telecommunication networks adopt their
own set of standards, from the underlying transport protocols to
the codecs used to transmit media. Yet, they seamlessly interact
through a variety of conversion mechanisms. A call may traverse
multiple such networks, taking advantage of the beneﬁts offered by
each before reaching its ﬁnal destination.
The diversiﬁcation of telephony infrastructure signiﬁcantly re-
duces the integrity associated with call metadata, such as Caller-
ID [1], as it is either not transferred across these networks or is
transferred without veriﬁcation. This allows easy manipulation of
metadata by hardware and software including soft phones on desk-
top computers. For example, between January 21st and 26th of
2010, customers of banks in four states received calls asking them
to reveal personal information including credit card and PIN de-
tails. Many of these attacks use VoIP phones to anonymously and
inexpensively dial a large number of customers while forging the
Caller-IDs of these banks [30].
In this paper, we develop PinDr0p1, an infrastructure to assist
users in determining the provenance of a call — the source and
the path taken by a call. Through a combination of signal process-
ing and machine learning, we show that regardless of the claimed
source, the audio delivered to the receiver exhibits measurable fea-
tures of the networks through which the call was delivered. For
example, calls that traverse a VoIP network experience packet loss
that results in perceivable effects in the ﬁnal call audio. Such arti-
facts are noticeably absent in calls that have only traversed cellu-
lar or Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs). In particular,
the codec transformations applied by multiple intermediary PSTNs,
VoIP and cellular networks, in combination with packet loss and
noise characteristics, allow us to develop proﬁles for various call
sources based solely on features extracted from the received au-
dio. In the absence of any veriﬁable metadata, these features offer
a means of developing source ﬁngerprints that help compare and
distinguish different incoming calls.
We make the following contributions:
1Our mechanisms take advantage of audio and path artifacts that,
like the sound made by the drop of a pin, are largely inaudible to
the human ear.
109• Identify robust source and network path artifacts extracted
purely from the received call audio: We show that the re-
ceived call audio provides extractable features that are strong
identiﬁers of the networks that the call has traversed, allow-
ing us to determine the provenance of a call. These include
degradations (packet loss in VoIP) and noise characteristics
of codecs unique to each network.
• Develop call provenance classiﬁer architecture: We de-
velop a multi-label machine learning classiﬁer based on the
extracted features to correctly identify the provenance of an
incoming call with 91.6% accuracy with as little as 15 sec-
onds of audio. Because PinDr0p does not rely on metadata
available in some networks (e.g., VoIP) or cryptography, it is
more readily deployable across the diverse devices and net-
works that make up modern telephony systems.
• Demonstrate our robustness in identifying call provenance
for live calls: We make calls using PSTN phones, cellular
phones, Vonage, Skype and other soft phones from locations
across the world and are able to distinguish between them
with 90% accuracy with only a small sample being labeled.
As we increase the number of such labels we are able to
distinguish between these calls with 100% accuracy. This
demonstrates that PinDr0p makes VoIP-based phishing at-
tacks harder and provides an important ﬁrst step towards a
Caller-ID alternative.
We note that while our approach does not provide the same guar-
antees as the use of end-to-end cryptography, it is also not encum-
bered with the difﬁculties of key distribution, management and the
requirement that both endpoints are capable of such operations.
The guarantees provided by our approach are instead more akin
to traceback techniques from IP networks [41]. However, PinDr0p
does not mandate the modiﬁcation of the core infrastructure to at-
tach additional metadata in-transit as our provenance information is
extracted directly from the received audio. While adversaries may
attempt to modify their attack in order to circumvent PinDr0p (e.g.,
change codecs, replicate the noise proﬁle and change the physi-
cal location from which an attack is launched to match packet loss
characteristics), our approach signiﬁcantly increases the difﬁculty
of successfully launching such an attack and improves the chances
of identifying an attacker.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
provides background information on telephony networks and codecs;
Section 3 discusses the details of our proposed call provenance
mechanism; Section 4 details our experimental setup and results;
Section 5 presents experimental results from a real-world attack
scenario; Section 6 offers further insight into our scheme and dis-
cusses trade-offs and limitations; Section 7 presents related work;
Section 8 provides concluding remarks and future work.
2. BACKGROUND
Telephony networks are exceedingly complex systems. While
once designed, manufactured and run by a single company, today’s
networks are an elaborate combination of many different technolo-
gies. We offer a very high-level description of these systems, how
voice is encoded in them and the transformations that occur as voice
crosses between different classes of networks.
As shown in Figure 1, there are three general classes of telephony
networks. PSTNs represent traditional circuit-switched telephony
systems. These networks are generally characterized by lossless
connections and high ﬁdelity audio. While pieces of the core of
some of these networks are being replaced by IP connections, these

tems. Note that a call between two endpoints may cross a va-
riety of networks. At each gateway, calls are re-encoded using
that network’s codec.

private links are tightly controlled to ensure near zero packet loss.
Like PSTN systems, cellular networks have a circuit switched core,
with portions currently being replaced by IP links. While these
networks can have considerably different technologies deployed in
their wireless interfaces, their cores are extremely similar. Finally,
VoIP networks by name run on top of IP links and generally share
the same paths as all other Internet-based trafﬁc. Accordingly, VoIP
systems virtually always experience packet loss.
Voice is encoded and decoded in each of these networks using
a variety of codecs. Speciﬁc codecs are selected for different net-
works based on competing goals including sound quality, robust-
ness to noise and bandwidth requirements. While a large number
of codecs exist, we describe and study the ﬁve most commonly used
narrowband codecs in this work. We summarize these codecs and
their typical environments in Table 1.
The codec used all over the world in PSTNs is G.711 [47], with
North America and Japan using the mu-law compression algorithm
and Europe and the rest of the world using A-law. Both the al-
gorithms generate a 64 kbps (20 ms audio frames) Constant Bit
Rate (CBR) stream for speech sampled at 8kHz, which is relatively
bandwidth intensive when compared to other codecs. In cellular
networks, the GSM full rate (GSM-FR) [22] codec was the ﬁrst
digital cellular coding standard and is still widely used in networks
around the world. Unlike G.711, which is a waveform coder, GSM-
FR uses predictive coding, which is more common among modern
codecs and allows a large reduction in bandwidth requirements,
with GSM-FR having an average bit rate of 13 kbps.
A plethora of codecs have been speciﬁcally designed for VoIP
systems. The Internet Low Bit-rate codec (iLBC) [20] is extremely
robust to packet losses and operates on a bit rate of 13.33 kbps (30
ms audio frames) and 15.20 kbps (20 ms audio frames). iLBC is a
mandatory standard for VoIP over Cable and is also used by Google
Voice and Skype [10]. Speex [6] is a Variable Bit Rate (VBR)
CellularPSTNGWInternetProxyGWGW110codec that supports a wide range of bit-rates from 2.15 kbps to 44
kbps and uses 20 ms audio frames. Speex, in addition to being
supported on many VoIP soft phones, is commonly used in gaming
teleconferencing systems such as Xbox Live [7]. A large number
of VoIP systems also use G.729 (10 ms audio frames) [48], which
requires very low bandwidth as it supports a CBR of 8kbps. Skype
also uses G.729 when making and receiving calls to landlines and
mobile phones (SkypeOut/SkypeIn service). It is also used by most
Cisco hard IP phones [9]. Finally, a number of VoIP phones also
support G.711, which is used in PSTN systems.
Audio must be reencoded when passing between two different
telephony networks. For instance, whereas the audio in a call be-
tween two PSTN users is likely to only have been encoded in G.711,
both G.711 and GSM-FR will be applied to the audio for a conver-
sation between users on a PSTN and cellular network, respectively.
Encoding changes occur in media gateways located at the edge of
telephony networks, meaning that VoIP calls can traverse multiple
Internet autonomous systems without necessarily being reencoded.
Through this infrastructure, phone calls are delivered seamlessly
between users. To establish call provenance, we seek to measure
these transformations as well as characteristics of the underlying
networks.
