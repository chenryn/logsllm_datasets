User: I have a server which is running CentOS with cpanel/whm. Otherwise, it is pretty much a standard set up.
My problem is that such server is running python 2.4 and I need python 2.6 or later. How do I upgrade without breaking anything?
By the way, I currently have a django application running on that server, which I would also like to move to python 2.6 without breaking it. Is there anything extra that I have to do to do that?
Assistant: The simplest way to install an alternate version of Python is to download the source and compile it. When you've finished running ./configure and make, you'll want to install using make altinstall, with python 2.6 you'd end up with an interpreter named python26
