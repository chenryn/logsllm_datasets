### Current Behavior
When more than 10 conditions are used in an `[ngClass]` object, Angular throws an error. The error is similar to the one thrown when using `*ngFor="let i of [1, 2, 3, ..., 11]"`.

### Expected Behavior
Angular should handle more than 10 conditions in the `[ngClass]` object without throwing an error.

### Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions
To reproduce the issue:
1. Create an Angular component with an `[ngClass]` directive.
2. Define an object with more than 10 conditions.
3. Observe that Angular throws an error.

### Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior
The motivation for this change is to allow validation and parsing of templates without having to define the object in the `.ts` file. This would provide more flexibility and reduce the need for additional code in the TypeScript file.

### Environment Information
- **Angular Version:** 2.2.1
- **Browser:** Chrome
- **Language:** TypeScript ES5
- **Node (for AoT issues):** `node --version` = v6.2.0
