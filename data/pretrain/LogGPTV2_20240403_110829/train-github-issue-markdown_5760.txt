**Current behavior**  
if more than 10 conditions in [ngClass] object, angular throw errors same as
*ngFor = "let i of [1, 2, 3, .......11]"  
**Expected behavior**  
it should handle without throwing error
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
try to validate when parsing the template without defining the object in .ts
file.
