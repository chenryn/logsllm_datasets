Stakeholder Management Plan. 
The  OCM  Practitioner  works  with  the  Project  Manager  to  develop  the 
Communication  Management  Plan,  as  prescribed  in  the  CA-PMF.  Depending 
on the size and scope of the efort, one project Communication Management 
Plan can be used, or a separate plan can be created solely for OCM. In either 
case, it is important to include the Communication Management Plan Feedback 
Channels  Amendment  template  in  the  development  of  a  Communication 
Management  Plan.  In  addition  to  the  guidance  provided  in  the  CA-PMF,  and 
Project  Management  Plan  (PMP),  the  OCM  Practitioner  should  consider 
including the following concepts into the Communication Management Plan to 
address OCM objectives: 
•   Messages about the “why” of the project: Ofentimes, Communication 
Plans focus on reporting project status, progress, and milestones. These 
concrete details provide good information for involved Stakeholders, such 
as the project team and Executive Steering Committee; however, these 
plans can fail to address the “why” of the project. One cannot always

he/she understands the bigger picture. This missing component ofen 
leaves Stakeholders with questions, including: 
◦   Why is the initiative a priority? 
◦   What is the future vision for the organization, and how does  
the change fit with the vision? 
◦   What are the objectives of the project? 
◦   Why is the organization implementing the change now? 
Therefore,  the  OCM  Practitioner  should  consider  addressing  the  “why” 
questions of vision, mission, and objectives as communication items within 
Section 4.2 Identify Stakeholder Communication Requirements, within the 
Communication Management Plan. 
•   Feedback  opportunities:  It  is  important  for  the  OCM  Practitioner  to 
remember that communication is a two way process and that audiences 
will  have  questions,  need  clarification,  and  want  to  provide  input.  By 
identifying  feedback  channels  within  the  Communication  Management 
Plan,  the  OCM  Practitioner  can  assure  that  Stakeholders  will  feel  heard 
and  valued.  Feedback  opportunities  should  be  addressed  as  specific 
communication  items,  with  defined  collection  channels  and  processes 
for feedback collection, analysis, and dissemination. Feedback processes 
should  be  documented  using  the  Communication  Management  Plan 
Feedback  Channels  Amendment.  This  amendment  serves  as  an  addition 
to the Communication Management Plan and assists the OCM Practitioner 
in identifying communication feedback channels, through with employees, 
leaders, and Stakeholders may provide opinions, ask questions, and identify 
communication related concerns to the project. 
•   Broader  audiences:  In  this  early  process  phase,  it  is  all  too  easy  for  a 
Communication Management Plan to focus solely on disseminating project 
status information to the project team. However, the OCM Practitioner and 
Project  Manager  should  discuss  the  benefits  and  risks  of  disseminating 
certain messages to a broader audience, following the guidance set forth 
in  the  Stakeholder  Register  and  the  Stakeholder  Information  Distribution 
Matrix within the Stakeholder Management Plan. While this is not the time 
to  provide  detailed  project  status  reports  to  the  entire  population  that 
will be afected by the change, it may be beneficial to start making these 
audiences aware of what may be coming down the pipeline, based on the

project objectives, and a change initiative “mission statement” will help to 
begin the process of enrolling Stakeholders in preparation for the changes 
coming  their  way.  The  OCM  Practitioner  should  document  the  inclusion 
of  broader  audiences  in  the  Communication  Management  Plan,  sections 
4.1  Identify  Stakeholder  Communication  Requirements  and  4.4  Define

Deliver Planning Process Phase Communications 
Once  the  Communication  Management  Plan  is  developed,  communication 
messages  will  be  disseminated  based  on  the  information  set  forth  in  the 
plan. Though the OCM Practitioner plays an important role in supporting and 
monitoring communication eforts, the OCM Practitioner does not communicate 
the  messages;  this  should  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Project  Manager  and/ 
or the Project Sponsor. One responsibility the OCM Practitioner may take on 
during the communication process is the collection, analysis, and reporting of 
communication feedback. This task may directly relate to OCM eforts in other 
knowledge areas. 
For  example,  an  OCM  Practitioner  may  utilize  informal  conversations  and 
observations  to  discover  from  project  team  members  that  employees 
participating in sessions to gather functional requirements appear disengaged 
or do not demonstrate support of the project objectives. Afer researching, the 
OCM  Practitioner  discovers  that  the  Project  Sponsor  has  not  communicated 
the  business  case  for  the  change  to  these  project  team  members.  The  OCM 
Practitioner will work with the Project Manager and Project Sponsor to analyze 
the  information  and  determine  appropriate  delivery  channel,  timing,  and 
message content in order to efectively communicate these drivers for change. 
The OCM Practitioner may also engage in Leadership Support activities to assist 
the Project Sponsor in building and demonstrating support for the change. 
The OCM Practitioner works with the Project Manager and team members to 
develop  and  disseminate  the  right  messages,  to  the  right  individuals,  at  the 
right time, by the right delivery channels. In order to record communication 
activities, the OCM Practitioner may utilize the Communication Action Log. This 
living document serves to track all communication activities.

2.3.1 Inputs 
In order to complete the Planning Process Phase Leadership Support activities,  
the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the following inputs: 
Project Sponsorship Action Register: The Project Sponsorship Action Register, 
completed  in  the  Initiating  Process  Phase,  is  an  informal  working  document 
that  details  the  Project  Sponsor’s  roles,  responsibilities,  actions,  and  time 
commitments to the project. 
Leadership Support Assessment: The Leadership Support Assessment guides 
the OCM Practitioner in identifying opportunities to further engage executives. 
Stakeholder  Register:  The  Stakeholder  Register,  completed  in  the  Initiating 
Process Phase, as prescribed by the CA-PMF, identifies the individuals with a role 
in the project. This document will provide input for the planning of Leadership 
Support activities.

two Leadership Support activities to accomplish this: 
•   Support and Assist the Project Sponsor 
•   Support Executive Leadership 
Support and Assist the Project Sponsor 
The  Project  Sponsor  should  be  actively  involved  and  engaged  in  project 
activities. The Project Sponsor not only provides critical feedback and guidance 
to  the  Project  Team,  but  also  keeps  other  key  executives  informed.  In  the 
Initiating  Process  Phase,  the  OCM  Practitioner  assisted  the  Project  Sponsor 
in creating a Project Sponsorship Action Register, which the OCM Practitioner

OCM Practitioner will provide additional guidance and support to the Project 
Sponsor on the use of OCM tools and techniques. The OCM Practitioner will aid 
the Project Sponsor in his/her role by: 
•   Monitoring the people-related factors of the project. The OCM Practitioner 
provides an excellent feedback channel between the Project Sponsor, the 
project team, and other involved individuals. By monitoring progress and 
feedback regarding the OCM efort, the OCM Practitioner, working with the 
Project Manager as needed, can report on critical OCM issues, gain approval 
for course corrections, and request the Project Sponsor’s assistance. 
•   Recommending  OCM  actions  for  the  Project  Sponsor  to  implement.   
The OCM Practitioner is in a unique position to not only monitor OCM eforts,  
but to guide the Project Sponsor in taking an active role in the people-related  
elements  of  the  project.  The  OCM  Practitioner,  working  with  the  Project  
Manager  as  needed,  may  identify  specific  actions  for  the  Project  Sponsor  
to take based on the monitoring eforts discussed above. Such actions may  
include:  participation  in  meetings,  one-on-one  conversations  with  project  
staf, and dissemination of project communications to executive leadership.  
The  actions  recommended  by  the  OCM  Practitioner  will  vary  from  project  
to  project  and  organization  to  organization.  The  OCM  Practitioner  should  
maintain and update the Project Sponsorship Action Register with additional  
actions, as needed. 
•   Providing coaching and guidance to the Project Sponsor. Occasionally, 
the  OCM  Practitioner  may  observe  a  need  to  strengthen  the  Project 
Sponsor’s  efectiveness  as  a  visible  leader  of  the  project.  The  OCM 
Practitioner should take a proactive role in assessing the Project Sponsor’s 
progress and efectiveness, and identify potential leadership concerns to 
address. The OCM Practitioner should monitor the Project Sponsor’s role as 
he/she completes the recommended activities during this process phase. 
Support Executive Leadership 
In the Initiating Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner identified, assessed, and 
addressed all executive leaders who are involved in the project, as identified 
in  the  Stakeholder  Register.  The  OCM  Practitioner  utilized  the  Leadership 
Support Assessment to rank leaders on their relative OCM priority, based on 
their level of influence and level of project support. In this process phase, the 
OCM Practitioner should continue to build leadership support by meeting with

of the project, as well as identify any potential barriers to support the change. 
These interviews serve many purposes, including: 
•   Fostering in-depth connections between the OCM Practitioner  
and executives 
•   Encouraging thought among executives about what is required for a 
successful change initiative, and what their role should be 
•   Building the OCM Practitioner’s understanding of the organizational  
“lay of the land”, so the Practitioner can help the project team navigate  
the political issues and struggles that are inevitably a part of change. 
The  OCM  Practitioner  can  utilize  the  Executive  Interview  Guide  to  facilitate 
discussions.  The  Executive  Interview  Guide  addresses  general  background 
information about the executive, prior experience with change, the organization’s 
vision and strategy, and political environment and team dynamics. It is meant 
to be an informal working document, which the OCM Practitioner may use to 
guide  Leadership  Support  activities.  The  Executive  Interview  Guide  includes 
questions such as: 
•   What do you see as the main strengths and concern of the organization/ 
organizational unit/etc.? How will this be afected by the pending change? 
•   Have you ever been through a similar change initiative? If so, what was 
it like? What did you conclude about what conditions produce the best 
results? If not, what expectations do you have about what it will be like? 
•   How well-developed is the organization’s vision/strategy, in your opinion? 
What is missing from the vision/strategy? 
•   How widely supported is this change initiative within the executive group? 
Are there any questions that divide the group? What causes these divisions 
or diferences in perspective? 
Once  the  OCM  Practitioner  has  conducted  these  interviews,  he/she  should 
compile the data to identify the main strengths (as a foundation for a successful 
change initiative), main questions (or things to be looked into), and possible 
concerns  (or  things  that  could  impede  success).  The  Practitioner  should 
assess on an individual level as well as for the executive leadership group as a 
whole. In this manner, the OCM Practitioner may build on identified strengths, 
research  questions,  and  identify  actions  to  address  possible  problems.  The 
OCM  Practitioner  may  need  to  engage  the  Project  Sponsor  to  help  address

The OCM Practitioner may utilize the Leadership Support Action Log to record 
and  track  all  Leadership  Support  activities.  This  working  document,  initially 
develop in the Concept Process Phase, allows the OCM Practitioner to track all 
Leadership Support actions throughout the PMLC. It should be reviewed and

grow and expand, which can ofen put a strain on the working environment 
and team culture. As such, the OCM Practitoner works in this process phase to
