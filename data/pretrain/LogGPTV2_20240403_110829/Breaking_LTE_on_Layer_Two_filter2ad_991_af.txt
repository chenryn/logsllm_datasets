Eavesdropping. Mobile networks, and GSM in particular,
are subject to passive attacks on weak encryption algorithms.
Ciphertext-only attacks [56]–[58] enable an attacker to break
standard algorithms like A5/1 and A5/2 within a few minutes,
just using ordinary hardware and rainbow tables [59]. As a
consequence, the attacker can eavesdrop the communication.
In the context of our user data manipulation attack we do
not exploit any weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms
of LTE but beneﬁt from the malleability of the cipher, e. g.,
we perform a chosen-ciphertext attack. This approach has a
neglectable overhead and allows to break the data link layer
security despite the presence of state-of-the-art encryption.
VI. CONCLUSION
While lots of research effort in LTE security focuses on
the physical and network layers,
the data link layer has
remained unexplored until now. We present a comprehensive
layer two security analysis and reveal open attack vectors.
More speciﬁcally, we presented three individual attacks on the
data link layer of LTE. The identity mapping attack passively
matches two temporary identiﬁers, reveals the location and
the radio layer identity of users within the mobile cell, and
thereby serves as a starting point for further attacks. One
example for this is the website ﬁngerprinting attack, in which
we exploit the scheduling information for resource allocation
in LTE. On the basis of unencrypted metadata information,
we demonstrate how an adversary can derive the accessed
websites with severe privacy implications for the user. Finally,
we present the user data manipulation attack ALTER. We
perform a chosen-ciphertext attack by deploying a malicious
relay and exploiting the missing integrity protection of LTE
user data. As a result, we can redirect DNS requests and spoof
the DNS responses. We demonstrate the real-world feasibility
of all three attacks in realistic setups.
Based on our ﬁndings, we urgently demand the imple-
mentation of effective countermeasures in the upcoming 5G
speciﬁcation to assure the security and privacy of future mobile
communication.
