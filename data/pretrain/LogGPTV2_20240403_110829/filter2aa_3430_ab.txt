**Shor’s Algorithm: Turning Factoring into Period Finding**

1. **Periodicity and Modulo Arithmetic:**
   - Since \( F(a) \) is periodic with period \( r \) and \( x_0 \mod N = 1 \), it follows that \( x^r \mod N = 1 \). Therefore, \( r \) is the smallest positive integer such that \( x^r \equiv 1 \pmod{N} \).
   - This implies:
     - \( x^r \equiv 1 \pmod{N} \)
     - \( (x^{r/2})^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{N} \)
     - \( (x^{r/2})^2 - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{N} \)
     - If \( r \) is even, then \( (x^{r/2} + 1)(x^{r/2} - 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{N} \).

2. **Finding Factors:**
   - The expression \( (x^{r/2} + 1)(x^{r/2} - 1) \) is an integer multiple of \( N \), the number to be factored.
   - As long as neither \( x^{r/2} + 1 \) nor \( x^{r/2} - 1 \) is a multiple of \( N \), at least one of them must share a nontrivial factor with \( N \).
   - By computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x^{r/2} - 1 \) and \( N \), and the GCD of \( x^{r/2} + 1 \) and \( N \), we can obtain a factor of \( N \).

3. **Quantum Period Finding (Simplified):**
   - **Step 1:** Initialize qubits into an equal superposition.
   - **Step 2:** Compute modular exponentiation.
   - **Step 3:** Perform the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to amplify the amplitude of the correct result.
   - **Step 4:** Measure the system to obtain the period \( r \).

4. **Optimized Quantum Factoring:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - Choose a random number \( a \) such that \( p + q \) is true with overwhelming probability.
     - Given \( N = pq \) and \( d = p + q \) (where both \( N \) and \( d \) are known), it is straightforward to recover \( p \) and \( q \) as the roots of the quadratic equation \( p^2 - dp + N = 0 \).

5. **Comparison with Shor's Algorithm:**
   - The quantum part is similar to Shor's algorithm, but with the following differences:
     - There are two exponents \( e_1 \) and \( e_2 \) of lengths \( 2m \) and \( m \) qubits respectively, where \( m \) is a positive integer such that \( p + q < 2^m \).
     - Period finding is performed on the function \( f(e_1, e_2) = g^{e_1 y^{e_2}} \) instead of \( f(e) = g^e \).
     - The total exponent length is \( n_e = 3m = 1.5n + O(1) \) compared to \( 2n \) qubits in Shor's algorithm.
     - This reduction in exponent length leads to a significant decrease in the number of multiplications required.

6. **Recent Advances:**
   - These optimizations have improved upon Fowler and Gheorgiu's work by over 100 times.
   - The number of qubits needed has been reduced from 1 billion to 20 million over the past 7 years.
   - Future optimizations are expected to bring even more exciting improvements.

7. **Quantum Annealing:**
   - Quantum Annealing is a process used to find the global minimum of a given objective function.
   - A quantum computer encodes the optimization problem into a physical system, allowing for the efficient exploration of the solution space.
