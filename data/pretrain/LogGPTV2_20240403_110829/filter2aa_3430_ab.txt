• Since F(a) is periodic (and 𝑥0 mod N = 1) with period r, that means 𝑥r mod N 
= 1 and thus r is just the first non-zero power where 𝑥r = 1 (mod N)
• This means
– 𝑥𝑟 = 1 mod N
– 𝑥𝑟 = 𝑥

• So 𝑥

𝑥
𝑟
2 − 1 is an integer multiple of N, the number to be factored
• So for as long as 𝑥
𝑟
2 + 1 or 𝑥
𝑟
2 − 1 is not a multiple of N, then at least one 
of them must have a nontrivial factor in common with N
• So computing gcd( 𝑥
𝑟
2 − 1 , 𝑁) and gcd( 𝑥
𝑟
2 + 1 , 𝑁)
will obtain a factor for N

– Pick a random number 𝑎  𝑝 + 𝑞 with overwhelming probability
– Hence 𝑑 = 𝑝 + 𝑞 is true. 
– With 𝑁 = 𝑝𝑞 & 𝑑 = 𝑝 + 𝑞 (where N and 𝑑 are both known), it is trivial to 
recover 𝑝 and q as the roots of the quadratic equation 𝑝2 − d𝑝 + 𝑁 = 0

• Quantum Part is similar to Shor, except
– There are two exponents 𝑒1, 𝑒2 of lengths 2𝑚 and 𝑚 qubits respectively, for 𝑚 a 
positive integer such that 𝑝 + 𝑞 < 2𝑚
– Period finding is performed against the function 𝑓 𝑒1, 𝑒2 = 𝑔𝑒1𝑦𝑒2 rather than 
𝑓 ⅇ = 𝑔ⅇ
– The total exponent length is 𝑛𝑒 = 3𝑚 = 1.5𝑛 + 𝑂 1 compared to 2𝑛 qubits for 
Shor
– This reduction in exponent length will result in the reduction in overall 
multiplications needed

• Using these optimizations, 
they’ve been able to improve on 
Fowler and Gheorgiu by over
100x
• We went from 1bn qubits to 
20m in the space of 7 years
• The next set of optimization will 
be incredibly exciting
