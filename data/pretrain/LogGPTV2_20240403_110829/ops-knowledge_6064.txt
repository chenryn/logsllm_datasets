Question: A mobile banking app is being designed with a high priority on security, especially concerning the establishment of secure connections to its servers. The app development team is considering implementing Identity Pinning to restrict the number of CAs that the app trusts. Which of the following statements are true regarding the use of Identity Pinning in this context? (Select two)
"A": "Identity Pinning will prevent any attacker from accessing the backend and exploiting server-side vulnerabilities, ensuring complete protection.",
"B": "Identity Pinning will protect against a compromised CA or a malicious CA installed on the device by only allowing connections to servers with identities included in the pinset.",
"C": "Identity Pinning should be avoided as it has been deprecated due to its complexity and operational challenges, with no security benefits.",
"D": "In the scenario of a CA breach, even if rare, Identity Pinning can help reduce the app's attack surface by trusting only specific CAs or certificates."
