User: Im running python code solution (automation) in linux
As part of the test im calling different api (rest) and connecting to my sql db.
I'm running the solution 24/7 
The soultion does

Call api with wget
Every 1 min samples the db with query for 60 min max
Call api again with wget
Every 1 min samples dc for 10 mins max.

This scenario runs 24/7
Problem is that after 1 hr/ 2hr (inconsistency-can happen after 45 mins for instance) the solution exit with error

Temporary failutre in name resolution.

It can happen even after 2 perfect cycle as I described above.
After this failure I'm trying to call with wget tens of times and ends with the same error.
After some time it covered by it self.
Want to mention that when it fails with wget on linux,
Im able to call the api via POSTMAN via windows with no problem.
The api calls are for our system (located in aws) and im using dns of our elb..
What could be the oroblem for this inconsistency?
Thanks
Assistant: This is tricky not knowing with which options you are calling wget and no log output, but since it seems to be a dns issue I would explicitly pass the --dns-servers=your.most.reliable.server to wget.  If it persists I would also pass --append-output=logfile and examine logfile for further clues.
