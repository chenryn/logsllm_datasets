I am running a Python automation script on a Linux system that interacts with various REST APIs and connects to a MySQL database. This solution is designed to run 24/7 and performs the following tasks:

1. Calls an API using `wget`.
2. Samples the database every minute for up to 60 minutes.
3. Calls the API again using `wget`.
4. Samples the database every minute for up to 10 minutes.

This process runs continuously, but after an inconsistent period (ranging from 45 minutes to 2 hours), the script exits with the error "Temporary failure in name resolution." This issue can occur even after two successful cycles. After the failure, repeated attempts to call the API using `wget` result in the same error. The problem eventually resolves itself after some time. It's worth noting that I can successfully call the API via Postman on a Windows machine during these failures. The API calls are made to our system hosted on AWS, and I am using the DNS of our Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

### Possible Causes and Solutions

Given the symptoms, it appears to be a DNS resolution issue. Here are some steps you can take to diagnose and potentially resolve the problem:

1. **Specify DNS Servers**:
   - Use the `--dns-servers` option with `wget` to explicitly specify a reliable DNS server. For example:
     ```sh
     wget --dns-servers=8.8.8.8 <API_URL>
     ```
   - Replace `8.8.8.8` with the IP address of your preferred DNS server.

2. **Logging**:
   - Enable detailed logging by using the `--append-output` option with `wget`. This will help in capturing more information about the error. For example:
     ```sh
     wget --append-output=logfile.txt <API_URL>
     ```
   - Examine the `logfile.txt` for any additional clues or error messages.

3. **DNS Cache**:
   - Check if the DNS cache on your Linux system is causing issues. You can clear the DNS cache using the following command:
     ```sh
     sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
     ```

4. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure that your network configuration is correct and that there are no intermittent connectivity issues. You can use tools like `ping` and `traceroute` to check the network path to the API endpoint.

5. **Check DNS Resolution**:
   - Verify that the DNS resolution is working correctly by using the `nslookup` or `dig` command. For example:
     ```sh
     nslookup <API_URL>
     ```
   - If the DNS resolution fails, it may indicate a problem with your DNS server or network configuration.

6. **Use Alternative Tools**:
   - Consider using alternative tools like `curl` instead of `wget` to see if the issue persists. For example:
     ```sh
     curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" <API_URL>
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to gather more information about the root cause of the DNS resolution issue and take appropriate actions to resolve it.
