Gentlemen,

I am looking to filter a multidimensional signal using a 1D convolutional filter with the `scipy.signal.fftconvolve` function, specifically along a specified axis. Is there an option in `scipy.signal.fftconvolve` that allows me to specify the axis along which the filtering should be applied?

Thank you.
