User: I recently bought a Windows 10 machine and now I want to run a server locally for testing a webpage I am developing.
On Windows 7 it was always very simple to start a HTTP Server via python and the command prompt. Fx writing the below code would fire up a HTTP server and I could watch the website through localhost.

C:\pathToIndexfile\python -m SimpleHTTPServer

This does however not seems to work on Windows 10...
Does anyone know how to do this on Windows 10?
Assistant: Ok, so different commands is apparently needed. 
This works:

C:\pathToIndexfile\py -m http.server

As pointed out in a comment, the change to "http.server" is not because of windows, but because I changed from python 2 to python 3.
