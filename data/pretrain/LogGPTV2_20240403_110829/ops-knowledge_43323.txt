I recently purchased a Windows 10 machine and would like to set up a local server for testing a webpage I am developing. In the past, on Windows 7, it was straightforward to start an HTTP server using Python and the command prompt. For example, running the following command would launch a simple HTTP server, allowing me to view the website via `localhost`:

```cmd
C:\pathToIndexfile\python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

However, this method does not seem to work on Windows 10. Can anyone provide guidance on how to achieve this on Windows 10?

**Solution:**

After some research, I found that the correct command for Windows 10 (and more generally, for Python 3) is as follows:

```cmd
C:\pathToIndexfile\py -m http.server
```

It's important to note that the change from `SimpleHTTPServer` to `http.server` is due to the transition from Python 2 to Python 3, rather than a specific requirement of Windows 10.
