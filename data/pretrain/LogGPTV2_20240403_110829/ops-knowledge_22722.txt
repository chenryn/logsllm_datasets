User: I have a web crawling python script running in terminal for several hours, which is continuously populating my database. It has several nested for loops. For some reasons I need to restart my computer and continue my script from exactly the place where I left. Is it possible to preserve the pointer state and resume the previously running script in terminal?
I am looking for a solution which will work without altering the python script. Modifying the  code is a lower priority as that would mean to relaunch the program and reinvest time.
Update:
Thanks for the VM suggestion. I'll take that. For the sake of completion, what generic modifications should be made to script to make it pause and resumable?
Update2:
Porting on VM works fine. I have also modified script to make it failsafe against network failures. Code written below.
Assistant: Since you're populating a database with your data, I suggest to use it as a way to track the progress of the script (get the latest URL parsed, have a list of pending URLs, etc.).
If the script is terminated abruptly, you don't have to worry about saving its state because the database transactions will come to the rescue and only the data that you've committed will be saved.
When the script is retarted, only the data for the URLs that you completely processed will be stored and you it can resume just picking up the next URL according to the database.
