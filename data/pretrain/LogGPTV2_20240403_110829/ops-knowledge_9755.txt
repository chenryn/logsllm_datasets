User: Configure a set of load balancing clusters and set access policies.
Assistant: The following is a cluster configuration that can achieve load balancing: 1. Create a load balancer (Load Balancer) server, which will serve as the entrance of the entire cluster. You can use some well-known load balancer software, such as Nginx, HAProxy, etc. 2. Configure all service nodes in the cluster to load balancer. Each node should be an independent server with the same configuration and capabilities, and can be deployed using a virtual machine or a physical machine. 3. Set the access policy, including the following aspects: - Select the load balancing algorithm, such as round robin, source address hash, etc. This determines how the load balancer chooses the next available server. - Set weights for each server, which is the core of load balancing. Different servers can be set with different weights so that their load ratios are different. - Establish a health check mechanism to monitor the running status of all nodes in the cluster. If a node goes down or has a problem, the load balancer should remove it from the service list in time to avoid affecting user access. - Set session persistence policies to ensure users are always connected to the same server during their visit. This is very important for some stateful applications. - Configure an SSL certificate to protect the security of user connection data. Through the above configuration, the load balancer can distribute user requests to different servers, and improve the reliability, stability and performance of the system by balancing the load.
