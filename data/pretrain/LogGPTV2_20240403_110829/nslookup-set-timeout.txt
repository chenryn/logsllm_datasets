- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `nslookup set timeout` command is used to change the initial number of seconds that the system will wait for a response to a DNS lookup request. If no response is received within the specified time, the timeout period is doubled, and the request is resent. The number of times the request is resent can be configured using the `nslookup set retry` command.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
set timeout=<seconds>
```

**Parameters:**
- **<seconds>**: Specifies the number of seconds to wait for a reply. The default value is 5 seconds.
- **/? or /help**: Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Examples:**
To set the timeout for getting a response to 2 seconds:
```plaintext
set timeout=2
```

This command will configure the DNS lookup tool to wait for 2 seconds before timing out and resending the request if no response is received.
