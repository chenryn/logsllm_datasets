User: Why doesn't Fedora server start after reboot? How to diagnose and fix this problem?
Assistant: 1. Check if the hardware is working properly. You can check for loose cable connections, power supplies are properly connected, server fans are running, and more. 2. Check the operating system and file system for corruption. You can select the Fedora system on the grub boot interface, enter e to enter the edit mode, add init=/bin/bash to the kernel line, press F10 to save and exit, enter the bash command line, and check the file system, disk partition, file permissions, etc. 3. Check the system log. You can use the command dmesg or journalctl to view the log records at system startup to see if there are any abnormal messages or error prompts. 4. Use the fsck tool to repair errors in file systems and disk partitions. You can add e2fsck or fsck.ext4 commands in edit mode to repair the file system. 5. If none of the above methods can solve the problem, you can try to use recovery mode to repair and restore the system. You can select the Fedora system on the grub boot interface, enter e to enter the edit mode, add single or emergency to the kernel line, press F10 to save and exit, enter the recovery mode, and perform repair and recovery operations. 6. If the above methods still cannot solve the problem, you may need to reinstall the Fedora operating system. You can back up existing data and reinstall the Fedora system.
