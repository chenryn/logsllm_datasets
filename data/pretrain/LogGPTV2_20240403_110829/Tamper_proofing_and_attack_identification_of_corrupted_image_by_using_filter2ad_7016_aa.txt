ABSTRACT
We  propose  a  novel 
semi-fragile  multiple-watermarking 
algorithm based on quantization index modulation. This algorithm 
utilizes two quantization steps to yield the non-uniform intervals 
in the real-number axis. Each interval corresponds to one binary 
symbol,  includes  stable-zero  (S0),  unstable-zero  (U0),  stable-one 
(S1),  and  unstable-one  (U1).  In  addition,  visual  cryptography  is 
integrated  with  the  watermarking  algorithm  to  increase  the 
watermark  capacity.  Therefore,  the  host  image  is  embedded  the 
multiple watermarks, and then we extract the watermarks from the 
corrupted  image.  According  to  the  extracted  watermarks,  the 
algorithm achieves the tamper proofing and attack identification. 
From  the  experimental  result,  it  shows  single  and  multiple 
tampered areas are detected and demonstrates that the amount of 
test images will not influence the accuracy of attack identification.

The  digital  multimedia  widely  spread 
the  commercial, 
entertainment, art, etc. However, the pirates illegally copy, tamper 
and edit the media, threaten to the media industry. For this reason, 
the  research  workers  study  the  various  schemes  to  protect  the 
products  copyright  and  its  authorization,  and  watermarking 
technique was developed. Most of watermarking techniques work 
on the spatial, frequency, wavelet and other domains [1-17]. 
Fragile, semi-fragile and robust watermarking schemes have 
different  capability  of  signal  security.  Fragile  watermarking  is 
weak  against  any  attack/distortion,  but  the  robust  watermarking

In  this  paper,  the  proposed  algorithm  can  embed  bi-

2000  compression,  Gaussian  noise,  image  rotation,  frequency 
mode  Laplacian  removal,  salt  and  pepper  noise,  and  region 
modification;  however,  it  is  fragile  against  median  filtering, 
Gaussian blurring, lowpass filtering, and image scaling. For JPEG 
compression,  the  average  compression  rate  ranges  from  0.77 
bits/pixel (quality factor, QF=40%) to 6.01 bits/pixel (QF=100%). 
For JPEG-2000 compression, the compression rate is 2 bits/pixel 
applied to the tested image. 
This paper is organized as follows. The previous works are 
described  in  Section  2.  Section  3  will  introduce  the  proposed 
algorithm. The experimental results are shown in Section 4. The 
conclusions are made in Section 5.

2.  PREVIOUS WORKS 
2.1  Quantization-base Watermarking Technique 
The 
(QIM)  watermarking 
technique, requires low complexity than the other techniques, has 
been presented in [8-13]. The conventional approach divides the 
real-number  axis  into  the  uniform  intervals  by  one  quantization 
step, and then sets watermark symbols to these intervals. Given a 
quantization step Q, the sum value t is located at the p-th interval 
is represented as p=(cid:172)t/Q(cid:188). In the watermark embedding, the host 
data  Y  is  modified  to  ensure  its  sum  value  tY  located  at  the 
specified interval. During the watermark extracting, we measure 
tY’ of watermarked data Y’ and then extract the watermark symbol. 
The quantization step size influences the watermarked image 
quality  and  attack 
tolerance.  The  small  quantization  step 
preserves the higher image quality than the large one. However, 
the  watermarked  image  is  robust  against  various  attacks  with 
large  quantization  step,  but  is  weak  with  the  small  one.  To 
overcome  the  drawback  of  attack  tolerance  in  the  watermarking 
scheme, the mean-quantization methods are suggested to increase 
the  watermark  robustness.  Yu  et  al.  [8,  9]  adopt  the  mean 
quantization  base  watermarking  approach  to  achieve  the  image 
authentication and detect the malicious tampering, the method is 
performed in the wavelet domain. The similar idea is addressed in 
[10], Chen et al. present a mean quantization approach to achieve 
the copyright protection of digital image in the wavelet domain as 
well. Eggers et al. investigate a watermarking scheme [11], which 
uses  the  dithered  quantization  and  combines  fingerprinting,  for 
distinguishing  the  copies  of  multimedia  document.  Chen  et  al. 
develop  the  quantization  index  modulation  to  achieve  the 
information  embedding  [12].  Moreover,  Mihcak  et  al.  have 
proposed  the  multiple  non-uniform  quantization  steps  to  embed 
more symbols [13]. 
2.2  Visual Cryptography 
Visual cryptography is a secret sharing method that uses human 
viewing  to  get  the  secret  information.  A  well-known  2-out-of-2 
visual  threshold  method  encodes  the  pixel  by  two  arrays  of 
subpixels. Subsequently, the k-out-of-n visual threshold methods 
were  discussed  in  [19,  20].  The  secret  image  encrypts  to  derive

two shares, and both shares are the random binary images in the 
previous  studies.  However,  Naor  et  al.  present  an  extension  to 
construct  a  method,  which  adopts  the  special  2(cid:117)2  arrays  of 
subpixel to yield the meaningful binary shares.  
Hou  et  al.  suggest  an  asymmetric  watermarking  method 
based on visual cryptography [25]. They encrypted a secret image 
to yield two shares, one share is embedded in the host image by 
watermarking technique and the other is treated as the secret key 
for  extracting  watermark.  To 
the  watermarking 
technique  and  visual  cryptography  for  increasing  the  watermark 
capacity is our search purpose, and we will extend the method to 
different applications.

3.  PROPOSED ALGORITHM 
3.1  Quantization-base Watermarking via Non-
uniform Intervals 
Most of previous studies for the quantization-base watermarking 
technique are usually to use a  single  quantization  step  to  derive 
uniform interval, and then assign binary symbol to each interval 
periodically.  Furthermore, 
the  method  embeds  only  one 
watermark in the host image at a time. 
In order to improve the watermark approach, we apply two 
quantization  steps  to  divide  the  real-number  axis  into  the  non-
uniform  subintervals  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  binary  symbols 
collocate two states to obtain four kinds of symbols: stable-zero 
(S0),  unstable-zero  (U0),  stable-one  (S1)  and  unstable-one  (U1).
The first quantization step Q1 is similar to the single quantization 
step of conventional approach, and further divides the quantized 
uniform  interval  into  some  non-uniform  subintervals  by  small 
quantization  step.  The  second  quantization  step  Q2,  which  is 
smaller  than  Q1,  determines  the  subinterval  width  of  unstable 
symbols (U0 and U1). The stable symbols (S0 and S1) adjoin the 
sides  of  unstable  symbol.  Six  specified  quantized  values  are 
defined by,

3.2  Watermark Embedding Algorithm 
The  basis  of  proposed  multiple-watermarking  scheme  is  the  bi-
watermarking  algorithm.  Assume  that  the  first  watermark  (W1)
and second watermark (W2) are meaningful binary image of size 
M(cid:117)N. An M(cid:117)N state watermark WS, is composed of W1 and W2,
will be embedded into the host image. A size W(cid:117)H host image is 
divided into several M(cid:117)N blocks of the size a(cid:117)b, where a=W/M
and b=H/N. W1(i,j), W2(i,j) and WS(i,j) denote the watermark bit 
of  1st,  2nd  and  state  watermarks  at  (i,j)-th  position,  respectively.
