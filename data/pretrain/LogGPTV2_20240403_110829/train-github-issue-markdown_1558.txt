When working with real-world data, it is common to encounter poorly formatted files and other issues. One frequent challenge I face when handling DataFrames in Julia is illustrated by the following scenario:

```julia
julia> int.(df["Age"])
ERROR: ArgumentError: 'F' is not a valid digit (in "F")
Stacktrace:
 [1] parseint at ./string.jl:1209 [inlined]
 [2] int at ./string.jl:1242 [inlined]
 [3] map_to2 at ./abstractarray.jl:1450 [inlined]
 [4] map at ./abstractarray.jl:1459 [inlined]
 [5] int at /Users/viral/.julia/DataFrames/src/dataarray.jl:746 [inlined]
```

In this case, the `Age` column should contain integers, but due to some corrupt or improperly formatted data, `readtable` has left the column as a string. Attempting to convert the entire column to integers using `int.` results in an error, indicating that there is invalid data within the column. However, this method does not provide information on which specific entries are causing the issue.

To identify and handle these problematic entries, I often use a loop with a `try-catch` block, like so:

```julia
[try
    int(df["Age"][i])
catch
end for i in 1:nrow(df)]
```

This approach allows me to attempt the conversion for each row and catch any errors, but it is not very efficient or informative.

A more general and useful solution would be to have an `isconvertible` function. This function would take the same arguments as `convert` but return a boolean value indicating whether the conversion is possible. For example:

```julia
function isconvertible(T::Type, x)
    try
        convert(T, x)
        return true
    catch
        return false
    end
end
```

Using this function, I could easily check which entries in the `Age` column can be converted to integers and which ones cannot, allowing for more targeted and efficient data cleaning.
