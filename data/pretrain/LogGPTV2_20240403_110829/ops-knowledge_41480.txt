User: For a data center in the event of a power outage, how to perform fast failover and recovery?
Assistant: For a data center in case of a power outage, the following measures can be taken to quickly perform failover and recovery: 1. Set up a backup power supply and UPS (uninterruptible power supply): Before the backup power supply of the data center is exhausted, the UPS will automatically switch, thereby Ensure that servers and network equipment can operate normally and will not go down due to power outages. 2. Establish a cold backup: establish a complete mirror backup, which can be quickly started to continue to provide services when the data center fails. 3. Use cloud services: back up data to cloud storage services, which can quickly restore data in the event of a data center failure. 4. Real-time replication and disaster recovery technology: establish a backup data center to realize real-time data replication. When the main server fails, it will immediately switch to the backup server to continue providing services. 5. Virtualization at the physical level: run a virtual machine on multiple servers to realize the sharing of multiple servers, enabling failover and rapid recovery. 6. Automated process and planning: Establish a good failover plan so that it can be automatically implemented in the event of a failure and the service can be restored as soon as possible.
