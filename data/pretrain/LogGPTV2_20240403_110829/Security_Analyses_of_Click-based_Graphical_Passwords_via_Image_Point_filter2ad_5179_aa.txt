ABSTRACT 
We  propose  a  novel  concept  and  a  model  of  image  point 
memorability (IPM) for analyzing click-based graphical passwords 
that  have  been  studied  extensively  in  both  the  security  and  HCI 
communities.  In  our  model,  each  point  in  an  image  is  associated 
with a numeric index that indicates the point’s memorability level. 
This  index  can  be  approximated  either  by  automatic  computer 
vision  algorithms  or  via  human  assistance.  Using  our  model,  we 
can rank-order image points by their relative memorability with a 
decent accuracy. We show that the IPM model has both defensive 
and offensive applications. On the one hand, we apply the model to 
generate high-quality graphical honeywords. This is the first work 
on  honeywords  for  graphical  passwords,  whereas  all  previous 
methods  are  only  for  generating  text  honeywords  and  thus 
inapplicable. On the other hand, we use the IPM model to develop 
the  first  successful  dictionary  attacks  on  Persuasive  Cued  Click 
Points (PCCP), which is the state-of-the-art click-based graphical 
password  scheme  and  robust  to  all  prior  dictionary  attacks.  We 
show  that  the  probability  distribution  of  PCCP  passwords  is 
seriously  biased  when  it  is  examined  with  the  lens  of  the  IPM 
model.  Although  PCCP  was  designed  to  generate  random 
passwords, its effective password space as we measured can be as 
small  as  30.58  bits,  which  is  substantially  weaker  than  its 
theoretical  and  commonly  believed  strength  (43  bits).  The  IPM 
model is applicable to all click-based graphical password schemes, 
and our analyses can be extended to other graphical passwords as 
well.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
A major development in computer security in the past decade is the 
emergence of “usable security”, which has now become a thriving 
and fast-moving discipline. Most, if not all, people agree that  we 
need security systems that are both secure and usable.  
A  hot  research  topic  in  usable  security  is  graphical  passwords, 
which  aim  to  deliver  a  graphical  alternative  to  ubiquitous  text 
passwords  that  have  long  suffered  from  various  security  and 
usability  problems.  Graphical  passwords  have  been  extensively 
studied in both the security and HCI communities, and have seen 
increasing deployments in the real world. For example, Microsoft 
Windows 8 has adopted a variant of the BDAS graphical password 
scheme [1]. Android's unlocking pattern scheme is also a graphical 
password system. 
A  major  inspiration  for  graphical  password  research  is  the  well-
known  fact  that  people  perform  far  better  when  remembering 
pictures rather than words. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a 
thousand words. This picture superiority effect has been studied for 
decades by cognitive scientists and psychologists [2,3]. However, 
these studies have mainly focused on the memorability of pictures 
or images as a whole.  
A notable exception is an MIT team’s pioneering work published 
in 2012 [26]. They introduced the notion of “memorability of image 
regions”, and studied which regions of an image are memorable or 
forgettable,  with  the  purpose  of  using  individual  regions  to 
predicate the whole image’s memorability. 
In this paper, we study memorability of image points, in the aim of 
making breakthrough in security analyses of click-based graphical 
passwords, in which a password is a sequence of points, referred to 
as click-points, on one or more images. Such graphical passwords 
include  a  family  of  schemes,  and  have  been  studied  the  most 
extensively. We propose a novel model to capture and describe the 
memorability of each clickable point in an image. In our definition, 
a  point  is  the  smallest  measure  of  an  image.  It  has  no  internal 
structure. In contrast, a region, as studied in [26], is a portion of an 
image  that  has  internal  structures  and  comprises  many  image 
points. Additionally, a spot is a very small portion of an image that 
comprises  points  considered  equivalent  in  click-based  graphical 
passwords.  For  example,  points  within  a  tolerance  distance  to  a 
click-point are acceptably equivalent to the click-point in verifying 
a  password.  These  points  form  a  spot.  In  this  paper,  when  the 
context  makes  it  clear,  we  may  use  a  point  to  refer  to  the  spot 
comprising its equivalent points, and reversely use a point’s spot to 
refer to the point. 
Our  work  was  inspired  by  fine  prior  work  [12-18],  which  shows 
that image points are not selected with equal chances: people prefer 
some  points  to  others  in  creating  passwords.  An  implied 
interpretation is that people associate different memorability levels 
1217to different points. However, we go several steps forward from the 
state of the art. Our main contributions are as follows. 
configuration has thus been widely adopted in studying click-based 
graphical passwords.  
For  the  first  time,  we  formulate  the  concept  of  image  point 
memorability (Section 3). We model the determination of a point's 
memorability  as  a  noisy  process  in  human  memory  where  both 
memorable and forgettable aspects (i.e. both memory retention and 
memory  decay)  matter.  Accordingly,  for  the  first  time,  we  have 
developed  a  heuristic  model  to  accommodate  numerical  methods 
for  describing,  measuring,  and  comparing  memorability  levels  of 
image points. 
As another novel contribution, we have developed two methods for 
implementing  and  utilizing  the  IPM  model.  One  combines 
automatic  algorithms  with  human  efforts,  and  is  called  human-
assisted  memorability  (Section  4).  The  other  is  a  computational 
approximation using automatic computer vision algorithms, and is 
called  automated  memorability  (Section  5).  While  some  of  our 
vision  algorithms  are  similar  to  those  in  [13,16-18],  we  have 
developed  new  algorithms  by  incorporating  available  vision 
techniques to either improve those used in the prior art or realize 
new functionalities unavailable. This computational realization of 
our  IMP  model  is  not  straightforward,  but  requires  significant, 
novel and creative efforts.  
We  will  show  for  the  first  time  that  our  IPM  model  has  both 
defensive and offensive applications in security.  
On the defensive side, the IMP model can be used to generate high-
quality  honeywords  for  any  click-based  graphical  password 
schemes  (Section  6).  Honeywords  (false  passwords)  were 
introduced at ACM CCS’13 by Juels and Rivest [20] for detecting 
password  compromise,  but  they  only  introduced  methods  for 
generating  honeywords  for  text  passwords.  How  to  generate 
honeywords for graphical passwords remains an open question. In 
this  paper,  we  will  offer  the  first  methodology  and  the  first 
experimental  study  of  honeyword  generation  for  graphical 
passwords.  We  will  also  offer  a  set  of  criteria  for  judging 
honeyword quality, and show that honeywords generated with our 
methods are of a high quality. 
On  the  offensive  side,  the  IPM  model  offers  a  new  approach  to 
mounting  effective  dictionary  attacks  on  click-based  graphical 
passwords (Section 7). We develop the first successful dictionary 
attacks on Persuasive Cued Click Points (PCCP) [7,8], which is the 
state-of-the-art  click-based  scheme  and  robust  to  all  prior 
dictionary attacks. We show for the first time that, when examined 
with  the  lens  of  our  IPM  model,  the  probability  distribution  of 
PCCP passwords is seriously biased. Although PCCP was designed 
to generate random passwords, its security is substantially weaker 
than previous common beliefs.  
Our contributions also include discussions of practical relevance of 
our  attacks,  and  measures  that  we  recommend  for  improving  the 
practical security of PCCP.  
2.  RELATED WORK 
2.1  Click-based Graphical Passwords 
2.1.1  Representative Schemes 
While the first envisaged graphical password scheme [22] is click-
based, the most extensively studied click-based graphical password 
scheme is PassPoints [9,10], wherein a user selects a sequence of (cid:1) 
click-points anywhere on an image in creating a password, and re-
clicks the same sequence of click-points within a preset tolerance 
range in authentication. Previous studies [9-11] suggested that (cid:1) =
5  results  in  a  good  balance  of  security  and  usability.  This 
As  described  later,  PassPoints  is  vulnerable  to  attacks  exploiting 
image  hotspots  [12,13]  and  click  patterns  [14].  To  address  these 
vulnerabilities,  Cued  Click Points  (CCP) [19]  extends PassPoints 
by  using  multiple  images,  one  click-point  per  image,  for  a 
password,  and  the  next  image  is  determined  by  a  deterministic 
function of the current image, the clicked tolerance square, and the 
user ID. Persuasive Cued Click Points (PCCP) [7,8] extends CCP 
by  requiring  a  user  to  select  a  click-point  within  a  randomly 
positioned viewport in creating a password. A “shuffle” button is 
provided for users to randomly reposition the viewport until a click-
point is selected. 
2.1.2  Dictionary Attacks 
Security of click-based graphical passwords has been extensively 
studied.  Golofit  [12]  examined  the  relationship  between  user-
created PassPoints passwords and the features of images used, and 
found that users tended to avoid flat regions, irregular structures, 
and periodic regular structures in selecting click-points. Dirik et al. 
[13]  also  found  that  the  click-points  of  user-created  PassPoints 
passwords tend to concentrate at certain spots, i.e., image hotspots. 
Chiasson et al. [14] found that there exist distinct common patterns 
among click-points of a PassPoints password, i.e., click patterns.  
Hotspots  and  click  patterns  have  been  exploited  to  mount 
successful dictionary attacks on PassPoints. For example, Dirik et 
al.  [13]  proposed  an  attack  on  PassPoints.  Assuming  that  people 
tend to choose as click-points the centroids that draw natural visual 
attention in creating passwords, this attack uses a visual attention 
model to predict the likelihood of a centroid to be a click-point. It 
has  achieved  a  success  rate  of  8.45%  on  a  representative  image 
using  a  dictionary  of  about  31 bits  (i.e., 2(cid:5)(cid:6) entries),  whereas  the 
theoretical password space was 40 bits [13].  
Automated dictionary attacks on PassPoints were also proposed in 
[16,17],  while 
the  most  comprehensive  and  sophisticated 
automated dictionary attacks on PassPoints were reported in [18]. 
In  these  attacks,  both  corners  and  centroids  are  detected  as 
candidates  of  click-points.  Heuristic  click  patterns  and  salient 
regions  detected  with  a  visual  attention  model  are  then  used  to 
select  likely  combinations  of  click-point  candidates  in  building 
attack dictionaries. On two representative images with a theoretical 
password  space  of  43  bits,  van  Oorschot  et  al.  [18]  achieved  a 
success rate of 7-16% using dictionaries of approximately 26 bits 
built  with  a  simple  pattern  combined  with  the  visual  attention 
model, and a success rate of 48-54%, the highest success rate ever 
reported, using dictionaries approximately 35 bits built with image-
independent patterns.  
Human-seeded attacks on PassPoints were reported in [15,16]. In 
these attacks, click-points from a small set of users were harvested 
for  targeted  images,  and  attack  dictionaries  are  constructed  using 
either  a  first-order  Markov  model  or  an  independent  probability 
model. On two representative images with a theoretical password 
space of 43 bits, the human-seeded attacks achieved a success rate 
of  20-36%  using  dictionaries  of  31  to  33  bits  built  with  the 
independent probability model, and a success rate of 4-10% within 
100 guesses using the first-order Markov model – the most efficient 
dictionary attack ever reported.  
Chiasson  et  al.  [14]  examined  hotspots  and  click  patterns  for 
PassPoints, CCP, and PCCP. The study concludes that PassPoints 
passwords contain both hotspots and click patterns, CCP passwords 
contain hotspots but no click patterns, and PCCP passwords contain 
1218neither hotspots nor click patterns. A later study [8] reexamined the 
data  collected  in  [14]  and  in  other  studies,  including  two  PCCP 
studies wherein the PCCP passwords were created with much more 
shuffles than those in [14]. According to [8], the click-points of the 
PCCP  passwords  examined  in  [14]  approach  complete  spatial 
randomness,  whereas  the  click-points of  all  the PCCP  passwords 
from  the  aforementioned  three  studies  deviate  from  complete 
randomness.  This  is  reasonable  since  more  shuffles  lead  to  less 
randomly  distributed  click-points.  Using 
the  click-point 
distribution of all the PCCP passwords, they estimated that a 33-bit 
dictionary had a mere 3% chance in successfully guessing a PCCP 
password in the set that traverses all possible combinations of the 
collected  click-points  [8].  It  would  be  much  more  difficult  to 
successfully guess an actual PCCP password since the actual PCCP 
passwords collected in those studies took only a tiny portion of the 
set.  Therefore,  harvesting  click-points  cannot  attack  PCCP. 
Harvesting  real  passwords  directly  cannot  attack  PCCP  either, 
since PCCP passwords are user-dependent: with a high probability, 
each  user  gets  a  different  sequence  of  images  for  her  password. 
Therefore,  PCCP  is  robust  to  human-seeded  attacks  that  harvest 
either passwords or click-points.  
An  image  typically  has  a  large  number  of  corners  and  centroids. 
Permuting all of them to form password candidates would lead to a 
huge  dictionary  that  is  ineffective  for  dictionary  attacks.  For 
PassPoints,  this  issue  is  resolved  by  applying  click  patterns  and 
salience to select only combinations that are likely to be a password 
in  building  attack  dictionaries.  For  PCCP,  there  is  no  pattern  or 
correlation  among  click-points  in  a  password  at  all.  This  leaves
