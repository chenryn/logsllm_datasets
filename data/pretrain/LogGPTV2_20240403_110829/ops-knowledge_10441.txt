User:  How to find and kill processes that consume too much CPU or memory in a Linux system?
Assistant: In the Linux system, you can use the following commands to find and kill processes that occupy too much CPU or memory: 1. Use the top command to view the processes that occupy the most system resources: ``` top ``` 2. Use the ps command to find the processes that occupy the most resources Processes with high CPU or memory: ``` ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head ps aux --sort=-%mem | head ``` The above commands will sort from high to low according to CPU or memory usage Sort, and then output the first few lines. 3. Use the kill command to kill the specified process: ``` kill [process number] ``` If you need to forcibly kill the process, you can use the kill -9 command. Note that killing a process may result in data loss or other adverse consequences, please proceed with caution.
