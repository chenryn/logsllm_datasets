In the latest releases of atom-shell when I add code for a BrowserWindow. It
loads the window my code has requested but then also loads an additional blank
one.
So for example I have this code:
    mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
           "width": 800,
           "height": 600,
           "fullscreen":false,
           "kiosk": false,
           "resizable":false,
           "frame":true,
           "web-preferences":{
              "web-security":false
           },
           "show":true
        });
But I get an empty white window (that is resizeable, and note that my code has
this set to false) in addition to my own window that I have requested.
What's really interesting is that if I set frame to false, this doesn't
happen! And if I delete the code above then it doesn't happen either. So it's
like calling a browserwindow with a frame in the latest versions causes a
duplicate window to be created.
I can confirm this bug happens in 0.19.5 and 0.20.3 but DOES NOT in 0.18.1, so
it seems a recent fix in the later versions causes this issue. I'm testing on
Windows 7.
