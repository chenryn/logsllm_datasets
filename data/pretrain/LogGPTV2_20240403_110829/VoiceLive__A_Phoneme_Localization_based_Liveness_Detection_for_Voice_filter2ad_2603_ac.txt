The TDoA Δt can be obtained as:

(2)
However, simply applying the cross-correlation method
results in an inaccurate estimation of Δt due to the mul-
tipath propagation and reverberation eﬀect of acoustic sig-
nals. To improve the accuracy, we further utilize general-
ized cross correlation with phase transformation techniques
(PHAT) [22]. By adding a weighting function into cross cor-
relation calculation process, it suppresses the frequency com-
ponents whose power spectra carry intense additive noises.
Meanwhile, PHAT utilizes the cross-power spectral density
of two diﬀerent acoustic signals to improve the system’s ro-
bustness to reverberation eﬀect. Existing work has shown
PHAT can further mitigate the spreading eﬀect that caused
by uncorrelated noises at two microphones [22].
Figure 10 shows one example of the TDoA values when
one participant performs 10 trials of authentication with the
passphrase “Oscar didn’t like sweep day”. The X axis shows
each phoneme sound, whereas Y axis shows the TDoA in
terms of number of delayed samples. We observe that TDoA
dynamics of these trials are highly similar and stable, with
only 1 to 2 samples variation under 192kHz sampling rate.
The results show that TDoA calculation is able to catch the
user’s unique speech production system accurately.
3.5 Similarity Comparison
Once the TDoA dynamic is extracted, we ﬁrst normalize
these TDoA values to the same scale as those stored in the
user proﬁle. Such normalization is used to deal with the is-
sues of device diversity and phone displacement. The phone
a user used to enroll in the system could be diﬀerent from
the one he/she used for authentication. As diﬀerent phones
diﬀer in size or distance between the two microphones, the
absolute TDoA values of the same phoneme could be dif-
ferent. Similarly, if the user places the phone at a location
slightly diﬀerent from that when he/she enrolled in the sys-
tem, the absolute TDoA values vary slightly. Normalizing
the TDoAs to the same scale could eﬀectively mitigate these
issues.
To compare the similarity of the TDoA dynamic with
the user proﬁle, we utilize both the correlation coeﬃcient
and the probability. In particular, the correlation coeﬃcient
,

measures the degree of linear relationship between two se-
quences [35]. Other than calculating the absolute diﬀerence,
it quantiﬁes the similarities in the changes of two sequences.
The correlation coeﬃcient ranges from -1 to +1. A value
of near +1 indicates a high degree of similarity, whereas a
value near 0 indicates a lack of similarity.
For the probability based method, we assume the TDoA
ranging error of each phoneme follows an independent stan-
dard Gaussian distribution. Given the TDoA value T DoAi
in the extracted TDoA dynamic, the probability that it
matches the one in the user proﬁle is represented as:
P (T DoAi) =
√
1
2π
σ
e−(T DoAi−T DoAi)2
(3)
whereas σ is the standard deviation of the error and T DoAi
is the corresponding TDoA value in the user proﬁle. Dur-
ing the user enrollment phase, we ask each user to speak a
passphrase three times to extract the averaged TDoA and
the standard deviation of each phoneme for similarity com-
parison. Given the probability value of each phoneme, we
simply average the probability values of all phonemes as the
indicator of the similarity score.
Correlation coeﬃcient and probability are two metrics tar-
geting on diﬀerent characteristics of the TDoA dynamic. We
refer to the former as Correlation, and latter as Probability.
Moreover, we develop a combined scheme that simply com-
bines the similarity scores of the correlation and probability
based methods. We refer to such a method as Combined
method, which takes advantages of both the correlation co-
eﬃcient and the probability.
4. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate our liveness detection system
under replay attacks including both playback and replace
attacks3. We also evaluate the robustness of our system
to diﬀerent types of phones, sampling frequencies, phone
displacements, and lengths of passphrases.
4.1 Experiment Methodology
Phones and Placements. We evaluate our system with
three types of phones with diﬀerent sizes and audio chipsets.
In particular, we experiment with Samsung Galaxy Note3,
Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S5. The distance between the
two microphones (i.e., one on the top and one at the bot-
tom) for stereo recording is about 15.1cm for Note3, 15.3cm
for Note5, and 14.1cm for S5. The audio chipset of Note3 is
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 MSM8974, whereas it is Wolf-
son WM1840 for Note5, and Audience’s ADNC ES704 for
S5. The operating system of these phones is Android 6.0
Marshmallow, which enables the phones to perform stereo
recording at 48kHz, 96kHz and 192kHz sampling frequen-
cies. These frequencies represent ranging resolutions of 7.08mm,

3.54mm, and 1.77mm, respectively. We use 192kHz as our
primary sampling frequency and present the corresponding
results unless otherwise stated. We also experiment with
two types of phone placements, as shown in Figure 11. One
is vertical placement with the phone placed close to user’s
mouth vertically. We call such placement our primary place-
ment and present the performance of such placement unless
otherwise speciﬁed. For the vertical placement, the phone
is about 3cm and 1cm away from user’s mouth on Z and
Y axis, respectively. The other one is horizontal placement
with the phone placed close to the user’s mouth horizontally.
The phone is about 6cm and 1cm away from user’s mouth
on Z and Y axis, respectively. We choose these placements
because they have relatively large achievable TDoA ranges,
which is discussed in Section 5.
Data Collection. Our experiments involve 12 partici-
pants including 6 males and 6 females whose ages range be-
tween 25 to 38. These participants are either graduate stu-
dents or university researchers, who are recruited by emails.
The participants are informed of the purpose of our exper-
iments and are required to act as if they were conducting
voice authentication. Each participant chooses 10 diﬀerent
passphrases of their own and performs 10 times legitimate
authentications for each passphrase after enrollment. To en-
roll in the system, each participant speaks a passphrase three
times to extract the averaged TDoA and the standard devi-
ation of each phoneme for similarity comparison. For online
veriﬁcation, users only speak the passphrase once. Each par-
ticipant speaks the passphrase with her/his habitual way of
speaking. The lengths of the passphrases are ranging from
2 words to 10 words with proximately half of them are 2-
4 words, one quarter of them are 5-7 or 8-10 words. The
experiments are conducted in both the oﬃce and home en-
vironments with background and ambient noises, such as
people chatting and HVAC noise.
Attacks. We experiment with two types of replay at-
tacks: playback attacks and replace attacks. For playback
attacks, we replay participants’ voice samples in front of the
smartphone that performs stereo recording for authentica-
tion. We utilize three diﬀerent types of loudspeaker includ-
ing DELL AC411 wireless speaker system, Samsung Galaxy
note5 and S5 speakers, to replay each pre-recorded voice
sample. In addition, half of the playback attacks are con-
ducted with stationary loudspeakers that are within 10cm
away from the smartphone (i.e., Static Playback Attacks);
while the other half are conducted with mobile loudspeakers
targeting on mimicking TDoA changes of users by moving
the loudspeakers around the smartphone (i.e., Mobile Play-
back Attacks).
For replace attacks, we place a smartphone with stereo

recording close to the target user when the user is performing
legitimate voice authentication. In such cases, the adversary
obtains a two-channel voice sample of the target and then
uploads that directly to the voice authentication system.
The only diﬀerence between the two-channel voice sample
obtained by the adversary and the one in legitimate authen-
tication is the recording distance. We adopt the Edward T.
Hall’s proxemics theory [15] to emulate how close an adver-
sary could place the phone next to the user’s mouth. As
shown in Figure 12, the minimum distances between people
are categorized by the relationship and types of interactions
between them. It includes intimate distance, personal dis-
tance, social distance, and public distance. With such a
guideline, we chose the recording distances between the at-
tacker’s phone to the user’s mouth as 30cm, 50cm, 100cm,
150cm, 200cm, 300cm, and 450cm, which simulates diﬀerent
types of relationships. We also consider the circumstances
where the attacker could hide behind or at the side of the
user. The recording distances for such cases are limited by
the size of user’s head, and are around 40 cm and 25 cm
away to user’s mouth, as shown in Figure 12.
Metrics. We use the following metrics to evaluate the
performance of our liveness detection system. False Accept
Rate (FAR): the probability that the liveness detection sys-
tem incorrectly declares a replay attack as a live user. False
Reject Rate (FRR): the probability that our system mis-
takenly classiﬁes a live user as a replay attack. Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC): it describes the relation-
ship between the True Accept Rate (i.e., the probability to
identify a live user as a live user) and the FAR when varying
the detection threshold. Equal Error Rate (EER): it shows
a balanced view of the FAR and FRR and is deﬁned as the
rate at which the FAR equals to the FRR. Accuracy: it mea-
sures the overall probability that the system could detect a
live user and reject a replay attack.
4.2 Overall Performance
We ﬁrst evaluate the overall performance of our liveness
detection system under two types of replay attacks: playback
attacks and replace attacks.
