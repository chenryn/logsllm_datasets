# Bug report
## Describe the bug
Simple javascript function to Router.push("/") will not work correctly.
in `_app.js` has:
    Router.events.on('routeChangeStart', url => {
      console.log(`Loading: ${url}`);
    });
which is working...
in my AppBar(Material-ui Toolbar) i have a simple onClick (i've also tried
with `` to no avail)
     Router.push(ROUTE.LANDING)}
              />
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
Create a new `` with href to `"/"` ....see if it redirects to your
homepage from another page.  
or  
Create a new element with an onChange parameter. `onChange={Router.push("/")}`
and see if it redirects to home page from another page.  
The current page will stay rendered, however the `routeChangeStart` callback
will fire...
## Expected behavior
I expect the home page (index.js) to be rendered within a few seconds of
calling `Router.push` or clicking a `` with `href="/"`
