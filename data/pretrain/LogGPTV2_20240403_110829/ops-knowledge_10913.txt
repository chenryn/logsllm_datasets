User: I have a python script that I would like to add a "Shutdown when done" feature to.
I know I can use gksudo (when the user clicks on "shutdown when done") to ask the user for root privileges but how can I use those privileges at a later time (when the script is actually finished).
I have thought about chmod u+s on the shutdown command so I don't need a password but I really don't want to do that.
Any ideas how I can achieve this?
Thanks in advance,
Ashy.
Assistant: Instead of chmod u+sing the shutdown command, allowing passwordless sudo access to that command would be better..
As for allowing shutdown at the end of the script, I suppose you could run the entire script with sudo, then drop privileges to the initial user at the start of the script?
