# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18995.1]
    Windows Terminal version: source git at: #aa682bfd (origin/master, origin/HEAD) doc: update the path to profiles.json (#3087) [Dustin L. Howett (MSFT)]
    Any other software? Ubuntu-18.04_LTS WSL 2
# Steps to reproduce
Simply open terminal, then open a new tab using the profile:
`"commandline" : "wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-18.04"`
Then run `$ ls` on a directory that has a lot of files (or any command such
that the screen displays more then the number of lines your terminal is able
show at one time. It may take more than one time, but usually after a couple.
# Expected behavior
There should be normal display lines without the shifting of a section of the
entry/cursor line down by one line; it should display correctly, like with
prior builds.
# Actual behavior
At some point, adding lines to the buffer after listing files (or anything
else), starting from where the cursor is at, the current line gets shifted
down by one line. Then near the end of the line, the remainder of the line is
displayed correctly.
Any typing is displayed on the line down and is initially treated as valid
input by your shell, but soon, the input line starts being displayed twice, or
characters don't show up correctly, and generally becomes visually and
functionally almost impossible to use.
I've also confirmed that is not related to any particular shell, commands, or
programs. It's how Terminal's display handling of the line that appears to be
the problem (no pun intended ;-).
Images attached show this more clearly. The first is simple file listing from
zsh. The second is an example in Vim that shows exactly where the shift
occurs. The cursor is on the line number that is underlined, but insert
characters display on the next line. And the status bar provides clear range
of the shift.
It's not .vimrc or any configuration issue in any program or dotfiles, none of
those have changed, and vanilla vim and/or nvim show it clearly as well.
