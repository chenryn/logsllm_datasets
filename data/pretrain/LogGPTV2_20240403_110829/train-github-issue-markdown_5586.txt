**Describe the bug**  
Running test using emulator (iPad11-webkit, Galaxy Tab 4 - chromium) as shown:  
use: {  
headless: false,  
screenshot: 'on',  
browserName: 'webkit',  
...devices['iPad Pro 11'],  
},  
use: {  
headless: false,  
screenshot: 'on',  
browserName: 'chromium',  
...devices['Galaxy Tab S4'],  
},
the execution generates the following error
    page.click: Evaluation failed: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'e.nodeType')
    =========================== logs ===========================
    waiting for selector "hz-navbar hz-base-avatar div[class="avatar"]"
      selector resolved to visible â€¦

    ============================================================
Using Chrome passes the test with different display settings but this only
happens when using emulator. Test case:
  * Navigate to a page
  * page.click(avatar)
when watching the test on the emulator:
  * page is loaded
  * avatar is not in view but present in the DOM
  * visually, scrolling doesn't seem to happen as element is never shown in view
