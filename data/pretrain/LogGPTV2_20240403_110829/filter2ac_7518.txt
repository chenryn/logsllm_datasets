To effectively mitigate DLL search order hijacking, it is recommended to use auditing tools that can identify and address such vulnerabilities on enterprise systems. Toolkits such as the PowerSploit framework include modules like PowerUp, which can be utilized to detect potential DLL hijacking weaknesses. Additionally, the `sxstrace.exe` utility, which is included with Windows, can be used in conjunction with manual inspection to check manifest files for side-by-side configuration issues in software.

### Recommendations:
1. **Use Auditing Tools:**
   - Employ auditing tools capable of detecting DLL search order hijacking opportunities.
   - Utilize toolkits like PowerSploit, which includes the PowerUp module, to explore systems for DLL hijacking vulnerabilities.

2. **Check Manifest Files:**
   - Use the `sxstrace.exe` utility to analyze and diagnose side-by-side configuration problems.
   - Perform manual inspections of manifest files to ensure they are correctly configured and free from issues that could lead to DLL hijacking.

By following these steps, you can enhance the security of your systems and reduce the risk of DLL search order hijacking.
