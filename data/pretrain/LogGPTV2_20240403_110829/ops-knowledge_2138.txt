User: I want to run many processes in parallel with ability to take stdout in any time. How should I do it? Do I need to run thread for each subprocess.Popen() call, a what?
Assistant: You don't need to run a thread for each process. You can peek at the stdout streams for each process without blocking on them, and only read from them if they have data available to read.
You do have to be careful not to accidentally block on them, though, if you're not intending to.
