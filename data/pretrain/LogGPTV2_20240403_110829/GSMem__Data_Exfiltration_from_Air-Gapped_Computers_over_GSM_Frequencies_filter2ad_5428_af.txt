Appendix A 
Receiver Implementation (Android Application Level) 
In 
this  appendix  we  show  how,  under  certain 
circumstances, the GSMem signals can be received by 
an  application  run  on  a  modern  Android  smartphone 
with an untampered baseband. This technique is limited 
to close proximity to the transmitter (10cm).  
Android Radio Interface Layer (RIL) 
Android, as part of its open source framework, defines 
the upper software layers  with respect to its hardware 
peripherals.  In  Android,  the  Radio  Interface  Layer 
level 
(RIL)  component 
telephony 
services 
the 
baseband  hardware.  Each  vendor  supplies  its  own 
implementation for the RIL interface. The vendor RIL 
is  closed  source  and  shipped  with  the  stock  Android 
firmware as a shared object (.so) binary file. 
Signal Demodulation 
We  developed  a  reception  method  which  we  refer  as 
‘neighbor  cell  jamming’.  According  to  the  GSM 
standard, mobile equipment must periodically listen to 
the  broadcasted  pilot  channels  of  neighboring  cells  in 
order to provide service reliability [58]. Generally, the 
mobile  must  always  be  registered  to  a  cell  preferably 
the  one  with  the  best  reception.  These  broadcasts  are 
sent  over  logical  channels  called  broadcast  control 
channels (BCCH), which carry information such as that 
cell’s  ID  and  configuration.  The  GSM  baseband 
component  maintains  a  list  of  best  neighboring  cells 
along  with  their  received  power  level  (in  dBm  or 
equivalent units) and other information. Since GSMem 
operates  at  the  same  frequency  as  the  neighboring 
BTSs, it is possible for a GSMem transmitter to affect a 
drop in the reception of a station that is rather far away. 
This jamming effect  can be used as a side  channel to 
detect  the  B-ASK  modulation  such  a  sudden  drop  in 
reception quality represent a ‘1’ and otherwise a ‘0’. 
Implementation 
Android  allow  obtaining 
the  neighboring  cells’ 
information  from  the  baseband.  E.g.,  by  invoking  the 
method  telephonyManager.getNeighboringCellInfo().It
