## Abstract
Scanning of hosts on the Internet to identify vulnerable devices and services is a critical component of many cyberattacks. Tracking this scanning activity provides valuable insights into the current state of vulnerabilities and their exploitation. Previous studies have primarily relied on unsolicited traffic captured in darknets, focusing on random scans of the address space. In this work, we track scanning activity through unsolicited traffic captured at the firewalls of approximately 89,000 hosts of a major Content Distribution Network (CDN). Our vantage point has two key features: it is distributed across about 1,300 networks, and its servers are live, offering services and emitting traffic. While all servers receive a baseline level of probing from Internet-wide scans, we find that around 30% of all logged scan traffic is the result of localized scans. These localized scanning campaigns often target narrow regions in the address space and exhibit different characteristics compared to Internet-wide scans. Our observations suggest that conventional darknets can only partially illuminate scanning activity and may severely underestimate targeted attempts to exploit specific services in particular prefixes or networks. Our methods can be adapted for individual network operators to assess if they are subjected to targeted scanning activity.

## 1 Introduction
Scanning of hosts on the Internet for vulnerable services is a crucial component in various cyberattacks, ranging from the exploitation of end devices and servers to the creation of massive botnets capable of launching DDoS attacks exceeding several Tbps. Given that scanning is a key part of many attack vectors, tracking scanning activity can provide insights into the current status of botnets, the targeted vulnerabilities, the origins of scanning traffic, and the networks particularly targeted by scanners. More generally, scanning activity offers an excellent signal for the current state of many vulnerabilities and their exploitation, potentially indicating future cyberattacks.

While the existence of widespread port scanning activity is well-known, relatively little research has focused on understanding the strategies and behaviors of scanners in detail. The lack of high-quality data stems mainly from the absence of large-scale data sources that can effectively capture scanning activity. Recent studies on scanning have primarily used traffic arriving at darknets, which are portions of routed address space that do not emit any traffic and only record incoming packets. Darknets face two fundamental limitations: they are isolated within the address space, often announced by universities or research networks, and they do not emit any traffic, making them attractive only to scans targeting the entire IPv4 space, a large random subset, or the darknet itself. They cannot provide insights into scans targeting specific regions of the address space, such as prefixes or networks with known clients, servers, or other types of "live" hosts. Scans targeting individual networks could indicate the intent of attackers to exploit or attack those particular networks, posing a potentially greater risk than random scans of the entire IPv4 space.

In this work, we leverage a unique dataset that overcomes the limitations of darknets and provides new insights into the prevalence and strategies of Internet scanning. Our telescope is based on the logs of unsolicited packets blocked at the firewalls of servers of a major CDN, distributed over more than 1,300 networks and actively offering services to end users.

Our key contributions and findings are as follows:
- We provide a detailed study of our distributed vantage point, consisting of 89,000 CDN servers, its suitability as a network telescope, and the unsolicited traffic logged. We find that all CDN servers receive a consistent baseline number of unsolicited packets, but also show evidence of local concentrations of unsolicited traffic. We quantify the additional unsolicited traffic attracted due to exposure of CDN IP addresses in forward DNS responses and develop tools to isolate scanning activity from other traffic components. We find that approximately 87% of logged traffic is the result of scanning activity.
- We develop tools and metrics to categorize scans into individual scanning strategies. While Internet-wide scans of the full IPv4 space and random subsets thereof constitute the majority of overall scan traffic, we find that localized scanning campaigns account for about 30% of scan traffic, in terms of the number of scans, the number of packets in scans, and the number of sources initiating the scans. Localized scans often target addresses in narrow areas of the address space and exhibit significantly different characteristics compared to widely-known Internet-wide scans, including the services targeted, repeated stateful scanning behavior, and scanner origins. Many of these characteristics become visible only after isolating localized events, as the volume of Internet-wide scanning campaigns can easily mask them.
- We compare our visibility against a /8 darknet and use our ability to classify individual scans to separate background radiation into baseline scanning and targeted scanning. We show that IP addresses of darknets receive baseline scanning activity but little in terms of targeted scanning, in stark contrast to the IP addresses of our distributed telescope. We find a three-fold increase in baseline radiation over the last three years.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to document widespread localized scanning activity in today's Internet. Our findings are relevant to the research community, as we show that darknets and derived statistics may be biased towards Internet-wide scans and might underestimate exploitation attempts of specific services in specific areas of the address space. As our classification methods can be adapted to individual networks, our findings are of practical use for network operators who want to determine if their hosts and infrastructure are subjected to targeted scans. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We review related work in Section 2, introduce our vantage point and dataset in Section 3, scrutinize background radiation and introduce our scan detection mechanism in Section 4, study target-selection strategies of identified scans in Section 5, delve into further properties of scans in Section 6, compare the visibility of scans in the broader Internet in Section 7, and conclude with implications and future work in Section 8.

## 2 Related Work
Scanning the address space is a key element leveraged by many botnets and worms. While essential for malicious actors, scanning the IPv4 space has also become relevant for measurement studies aimed at finding vulnerable host populations, patching strategies, and address activity, driven by the availability of tools enabling fast scanning of large parts of the IPv4 space in short time periods. Unsolicited traffic received in darknets, known as Internet Background Radiation, has been widely used to study the spread and activity of botnets and the exploitation of vulnerabilities. Other works have studied the general characteristics of Background Radiation and how it can be used for network analysis, inference, and debugging.

To the best of our knowledge, only one recent work presents broad and detailed characteristics of widespread scanning behavior in the Internet. Using a darknet telescope, the authors focus solely on Internet-wide scans, i.e., scans that probe a random subset or the entirety of the IPv4 space. They infer that if a source probes a given percentage of the addresses of the darknet, then that source is likely probing that percentage of addresses of the public IPv4 address space. Benson et al. studied scan visibility in two darknets: one is the same as in the previous work, and the other is a different /8 prefix. One of their findings is that scan traffic arrives with equal probability in the two different (appropriately scaled) darknets, which suggests a lack of localized scanning at the level of these vantage points. Our work complements and extends previous research by providing widespread evidence of localized scanning activity and illuminating a more complex picture of scanning activity in today's Internet.

## 3 A Distributed Network Telescope
In this section, we introduce our vantage point, the relevant properties of our data collection mechanism, and a first-order characterization of the traffic arriving at our telescope.

### 3.1 Data Collection & Sampling
We base this work on logs of unsolicited packets collected at the firewall of a subset of the servers operated by a major Content Distribution Network (CDN). The subset we examine consists of 89,000 servers, each with two publicly facing IPv4 addresses, both in the same /24 address block. Although this set of 178,000 addresses is small relative to a darknet of, say, a /8 IPv4 prefix of 16.8 million addresses, these 178,000 addresses are located in 2,800 routed BGP prefixes originated by 1,347 Autonomous Systems in 156 countries, spread across 172 different /8 prefixes.

#### Client-Facing and Operations IP Addresses
Of the two public IPv4 addresses on each server, in the same /24 prefix, only one is ever returned in forward DNS queries for domain names hosted by the CDN. We call this address the client-facing IP, and the other address is the operations IP, used solely for CDN-internal communication. The distinction between these two addresses is that the operations IP is never exposed in replies to forward DNS queries. Both addresses respond to ICMP pings and have PTR records set in the DNS. Each CDN machine runs services on some port numbers (most prominently port 80/443 for HTTP(S) and several non-standard port numbers for internal communication and customer services). All traffic not destined to any of the ports running an active service is dropped by a firewall, and, as described in the next paragraph, a total of 2.3 billion UDP packets were logged.

![Statistics on packets received per machine](figure1.png)

- **(a)** Number of packets logged per 10-second-machine bin. Less than 0.1% of 10-second bins logged more than 20 packets.
- **(b)** Daily packets logged per machine. Lines show median, box shows 25th and 75th percentile, whiskers show 5th and 95th percentile of machines. Each machine has two public IPv4 addresses.
- **(c)** Inbound packets blocked by networks hosting the telescope machines and percentage of telescope machines in these ASes. Up to 10% of networks filter specific ports on their ingress, yet the effect on our data collection remains small.
