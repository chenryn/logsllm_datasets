Hacking  Democracy :
A  Socratic  Dialogue
How  do  you  know
if  your  vote  was
recorded  correctly  
Which  is  more
important  to  you :
secrecy  or  verification
How  much  error  
is  too  much  for
legitimacy
Were  you  on  the
right  list
Were  you  in  the
right  place
Does  the  process
impact  you
more  than  others
Who  decides  what
becomes  news
Which  runner  is
in  the  lead
Is  the  playing  field
made  of  natural
or  artificial  turf
How  much  
free  speech
is  too  much
Can  foreign  guests
join  the  party
Is  this  an  
invitation  to  a
masquerade  ball
Which  innocent
victims  deserve
protection
Are  they  required  
to  accept  help  . . . 
from  their  opponent
Is  any  of  this
actually  
new  at  all
Can  two  rights
make  a  wrong
