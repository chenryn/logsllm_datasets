I'm wanting to include Bootstrap in a Drupal distribution that I'm working on.
Because I'm using the Drupal.org packaging system, I cannot include Bootstrap
because the APLv2 is not compatible with GPLv2 (which is what all code on
Drupal.org must be licensed as, per our license policy:
http://drupal.org/licensing/faq#q4)
I was wondering if you'd be willing to either release Bootstrap under another
license (in parallel to the Apache license) that would be compatible with our
packaging system, or license Bootstrap specifically to Drupal.org contributors
under a compatible license.
