### Issue: LDAP Login Error - Session Lasted Less Than 10 Seconds

#### Environment
- Two machines, both running CentOS 5.6 (64-bit).
- **LDAP Machine**:
  - Services: DHCP, BIND, and OpenLDAP.
  - Configuration: Correctly configured; users can authenticate against it.
- **Machine 2**:
  - Configuration: Set up to use LDAP for authentication.

#### Problem Description
When attempting to log in using a user saved on the LDAP server, the following error occurs, and the session is terminated after less than 10 seconds:
```
Your session only lasted less than 10 seconds. If you have not logged out yourself, this could mean that there is some installation problem or that you may be out of disk space. Try logging in with one of the failsafe sessions to see if you can fix this problem.
```

The `~/.xsessions-errors` file contains the following details:
```
/etc/gdm/PreSession/Default: Registering your session with utmp
/etc/gdm/PreSession/Default: running: /usr/bin/sessreg -a -u /var/run/utmp -x "/var/gdm:0:Xservers" -h "" -l ":0" "admin"
localuser:admin being added to access control list
No profile for user 'admin' found
/bin/sh: /usr/bin/dbus-launch --exit-with-session /etc/X11/Xinit/Xclients: No such file or directory
/bin/sh: line 0: exec: /usr/bin/dbus-launch --exit-with-session /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients: cannot execute: No such file or directory
```

#### Observations
- The user is correctly authenticated, and the `/home/admin` directory is created.
- The syslog does not show any errors.
- SELinux has been disabled to rule out interference.
- The system is a new install on an 80GB hard drive with over 80% of the drive still available.
- The `create home directory on login` option is set in the CentOS authentication panel.

#### Solution
The issue was resolved by setting the `loginShell` attribute to `/bin/bash` for the user on the LDAP server. This was necessary because the default shell on the system is `bash`, and the permissions and configuration required `bash` to create the default files needed for the X11 system.

#### Steps to Resolve
1. **Set the `loginShell` Attribute**:
   - Ensure that the `loginShell` attribute for all users on the LDAP server is set to `/bin/bash`.
   - Example LDAP command to set the `loginShell` attribute:
     ```sh
     ldapmodify -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W <<EOF
     dn: uid=admin,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
     changetype: modify
     replace: loginShell
     loginShell: /bin/bash
     EOF
     ```

2. **Verify the Change**:
   - Log in as the user to ensure the session is no longer terminated prematurely.
   - Check the `~/.xsessions-errors` file to confirm that the errors are no longer present.

By setting the `loginShell` attribute to `/bin/bash`, the system can properly initialize the user's environment and create the necessary files for the X11 session, thus resolving the session termination issue.
