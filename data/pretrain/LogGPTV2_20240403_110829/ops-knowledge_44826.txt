User: Please describe the life cycle of a Docker container, including the stages of starting, running, stopping, and destroying.
Assistant: The life cycle of a Docker container can be roughly divided into the following stages: 1. Creation: When creating a container, you first need to select the corresponding image as the container's operating environment. Docker will copy the selected image and create an isolated file system as the root directory of the container, and will also assign a unique container ID as the container's identity. 2. Configuration: After creating the container, you need to configure the container, such as setting the running parameters of the container, mapping the internal port of the container to the host port, etc. 3. Start: start the container through the docker start command, Docker will execute the start command defined in the image, and create a new process inside the container to run the command. At this point, the container enters the "running" state. 4. Running: When the container is in the "running" state, you can execute commands inside the container through the docker exec command, or enter the command line interface of the container through the docker attach command for interaction. 5. Stop: When the work of the container is completed or needs to be terminated, the container can be stopped through the docker stop command. Docker sends a SIGTERM signal to the process inside the container and waits for a while to make sure the process has exited. If the process has not exited, Docker will send a SIGKILL signal to forcefully terminate the process. 6. Destruction: When the container is no longer needed, the container can be destroyed through the docker rm command. Docker will delete all files and data related to the container and release related resources. At this point, the lifecycle of the container ends.
