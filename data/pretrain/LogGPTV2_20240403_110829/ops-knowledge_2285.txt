User: In ubuntu 9.10, in usr/lib/ there are the directories python2.4, python2.5, python2.6 and python3.0 
Only python 2.6 is actually working.
python2.4 has only a lib-dynload directory,
python2.5 has only lib-dynload and site-packages,
python3.0 has only a dist-packages directory.  
Now i'm wondering what is the idea behind this? 
Because when i install python2.5 with ./configure, make, make install | altinstall
this goes into usr/local/lib and not usr/lib/ so why were these directories added tu ubuntu, how am i supposed to install python to use them?
Assistant: Sounds like they're an accident from some package(s) you have installed.
The Python version in use determines the locations searched to find installed Python packages/modules, and the "system version" of Python in Ubuntu 9.10 is 2.6, so that's what practically everything should be using.  If you were to install the python2.5 package (or it gets installed as a dependency of something else), then it would use /usr/lib/python2.5/*.  Try running which python and python --version; also which python2.6 and which python2.5.
From what I understand, though I'm not sure exactly why at all, Debian (from which Ubuntu is derived) uses a dist-packages naming scheme instead of site-packages.
Terminology: Python has packages and Debian (and so Ubuntu) has packages.  They aren't the same kind of package, though individual Debian packages will install specific Python packages.
