**John Emmanuel** opened **SPR-6632** and provided the following comment:

In section 3.11.1 of the Spring documentation, the first code snippet is as follows:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public void myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

The method signature for `myService` is incorrect. It should be:

```java
@Bean
public MyService myService() {
    return new MyServiceImpl();
}
```
