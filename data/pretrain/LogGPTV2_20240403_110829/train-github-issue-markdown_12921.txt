The first code snippet in section 3.11.1 of the spring documentation is as
follows:
`@Configuration`  
public class AppConfig {  
`@Bean`  
public void MyService myService() {  
return new MyServiceImpl();  
}  
}
The method signature of the myService is incorrect. It should be
public MyService myService()...
Note: I did not check the forums to see if this issue has already been  
resolved. If already resolved I am sorry for creating this issue.
