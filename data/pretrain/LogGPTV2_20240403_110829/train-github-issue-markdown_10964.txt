This may be a duplicate of another issue, for example perhaps #6049. I'm
honestly not sure.
At this point I have bisected the problem down to:
`4a24f10` is the first bad commit  
commit `4a24f10`  
Author: Huon Wilson dbau.pp+PI:EMAIL  
Date: Wed Apr 24 22:29:19 2013 +1000
(But it is possible that Huon's code is just exposing a latent bug in rustc,
rather than actually having something fundamentally wrong with it itself.) I
plan to investigate backing out Huon's change to see if that makes the problem
go away, just so I can actually bootstrap a compiler and do more
investigation.
