#### Issue Analysis
This issue may be a duplicate of another, such as #6049. I am not entirely certain.

I have bisected the problem down to the following commit:

**First Bad Commit:** `4a24f10`
- **Author:** Huon Wilson (dbau.pp+PI:EMAIL)
- **Date:** Wed Apr 24 22:29:19 2013 +1000

It is possible that Huon's code is exposing a latent bug in `rustc` rather than being fundamentally flawed. My plan is to investigate by reverting Huon's change to see if it resolves the issue, allowing me to bootstrap the compiler and conduct further investigation.
