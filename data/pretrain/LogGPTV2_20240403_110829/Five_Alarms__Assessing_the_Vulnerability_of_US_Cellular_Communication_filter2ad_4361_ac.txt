type of service that each transceiver provides. We identify
the service providers from the OpenCelliD data by examin-
ing a combination of the MCC and MNC. A challenge here
is that the largest service providers do not have a single
MCC/MNC combination that identifies their entire network,
but have many hundreds that they have acquired through
business expansion, mergers, or acquisitions. These identi-
fiers frequently change ownership as the business environ-
ment changes. We use multiple sources to cross-reference
MCC/MNC [10] [11].

Table 2 provides a breakdown of cellular service providers
with the most transceivers inside the three most at-risk WHP
areas, both by total number of transceivers and by percent
of total transceivers operated by the respective providers.
We find that AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint – who
provide service to more than 95% of US cellular customers
– have the most infrastructure at risk 1. By percentage of
infrastructure at risk, each major provider has the most in-
frastructure at risk in the WHP moderate areas (3.9% to 5.5%)
and the least infrastructure in WHP very high areas (0.33% to
0.59%). This breakdown highlights the utility of using WHP
to identify the least amount of infrastructure in the greatest
risk areas, allowing cellular service providers to focus their
risk mitigation efforts.

Table 3 shows the wildfire risk to the various types of cell
transceivers in widespread use in the US. The most wide-
spread latest-generation transceiver, long-term evolution
(LTE), has the largest number of transceivers at risk in each of
the WHP categories. Although there were no 5G transceivers
in the OpenCelliD database when we conducted this research,
we expect to find growing numbers of at-risk 5G transceivers
as service providers extend their 5G network coverage out-
side of metropolitan areas. The additional complexity and
density of 5G cellular deployments will have to be consid-
ered in wildfire risk mitigation planning. However, 5G will
employ new technologies that could improve resilience, such

as Integrated Access Backhaul, that could allow on-demand
wireless backhaul to complement disruptions in fiber back-
haul.
Summary of key findings. All major US cellular service
providers – AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon – have cell
infrastructure in wildfire danger. AT&T has the most at-risk
infrastructure. Additionally, many regional cellular service
providers have infrastructure at risk.
3.6 Comparative Impact of Wildfire Risk
WHP provides important insights on comparing the rela-
tive wildfire risk to each cell transceiver, but this does not
quantify the potential impact on cell service; damage to a
transceiver in a rural area has a different impact than damage
to a transceiver in an urban area. The exact usage statistics
for cell transceivers are maintained by service providers and
are not widely available. Therefore, we used US Census Bu-
reau population statistics for each county as an index of the
number of people using a transceiver.
We refine the areas at risk of greatest cell-service loss
by looking at the most dense counties. Figure 11 (center
panel) shows the geographic distribution of the transceivers
identified as being in one of the Moderate/High/Very High
WHP areas and located in counties with populations greater
than 1.5 million people. Of the 57,504 transceivers identified,
over 38,000 are in the Los Angeles/San Diego region, with
another 8,000 along the East Coast, 1,400 in Texas, and the
rest spread between Washington, Arizona, and Nevada.
Finally, we identify the transceivers in very high WHP ar-
eas with county populations greater than 1.5 million people
We divide the most populous counties in the US into three
categories: (1) Moderately dense (Pop M) - counties with
more than 200,000, but less than 500,000 people; (2) Dense
(PoP H) - counties with more than 500,000, but less than 1.5
million people; (3) Very dense (Pop VH) - counties with more
than 1.5 million people. These three categories comprise
approximately 65% of the total US population. We argue that
a cell transceiver in a more dense county typically serves
more people than a transceiver in a less dense county. Losing
a transceiver in a more dense county will therefore have a
greater negative impact on mobile access.
Figure 10 divides the nearly 250,000 cell transceivers in
the three highest-risk WHP areas into the three population
categories described above. We identify 57,504 transceivers in
the 23 most densely populated counties that are in moderate
or higher danger from wildfires.
Figure 11 (left panel) shows the locations of almost 250,000
transceivers in the three highest WHP categories within
counties with populations greater than 200,000 people. This
division indicates potential impact to moderately or more
dense urban areas in high WHP areas geographically dis-
persed across the US.
transceivers in moderate hazard areas than high, and the very
high threat areas contain the least amount of infrastructure.
This is by design as the WHP categories were developed to
allow organizations to prioritize limited resources to protect
the assets in the most danger. Clearly, California and Florida
contain the most infrastructure that is in the highest danger.
While Philadelphia and Phoenix have a large number of
transceivers in danger, most are located in moderate hazard
areas.
Combining this quantitative information with geospatial
information in Figure 13, we identify specific regions with at-
risk cell transceivers surrounding San Francisco and San Jose,
east of Sacramento, east of Los Angeles and San Diego, and
throughout central Florida that are located in very high wild-
fire hazard regions. The key observation from these maps
is that the wildfire danger to infrastructure increases with
distance from the metro center. This graduated change to
at-risk assets is visible in the map of Los Angeles and San
Diego, with no wildfire risk along the Pacific Ocean or in the
most dense urban areas, but wildfire risk increasing eastward
from the city centers to less dense suburban areas. Wildfires
require organic material to burn as they spread. This ma-
terial is located mostly in the wildlands, but more limited
quantities are also found in rural or even some suburban
areas. Cell infrastructure is concentrated in the most densely
populated areas, but the network extends limited assets into
more rural areas and along transportation pathways so that
people can maintain mobile connectivity during travel. Cell
infrastructure is seen following roadways connecting urban
areas in central Florida.
Summary of key findings. In the metro areas identified
above, the wildfire impact to cell infrastructure is greatest
along the city edges in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI).
3.8 Extending Wildfire Hazard Potential
One limitation of using the WHP without modification to
estimate cell infrastructure risk is that much cell infrastruc-
ture is located along transportation throughways (such as
highways or rail) that go through high risk wildfire areas.
Most of the area alongside transportation throughways is
classified as either low risk or nonburnable, due to both the
increased vegetation management and nonflammable con-
struction materials. Therefore, the WHP identifies these areas
as having lower risk of direct wildfire damage. However, as
we mentioned in our case study of the California wildfires,
cell service is more impacted by availability of power than
direct damage. Disruptions to power distribution may occur
outside wildfire perimeters as electricity service providers
shut down their distribution networks either to reduce the
chance of sparking future wildfires or from minimizing im-
pact to firefighting efforts.

population density.
in Figure 11 (right panel). This geospatial analysis identifies
just over 7,000 transceivers that are located around eight
of the highest population cities: Las Vegas (10), New York
City (81), Phoenix (106), San Francisco/San Jose (935), San
Diego (1,082), Miami (1,536), and Los Angeles (3,547). Un-
derstanding the wildfire threat with this level of specificity
allows Internet service providers to focus defensive action
and mitigation efforts on areas likely to impact the most
users.
Summary of key findings. There are 57,504 cell transceivers
in high wildfire risk areas that serve counties with popula-
tions over 1.5 million people. Of these, the areas with the
most high-risk cell infrastructure are: Los Angeles, CA; Mi-
ami, FL; San Diego, CA; the Bay Area, CA; and Phoenix,
AZ.
3.7 Analysis of Highest Impact Areas
Clusters of highest risk emerge around major metropolitan
areas that border the very high threat WHP regions. There
exist clear clusters around a few major metropolitan areas:
San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Denver,
Phoenix, Philadelphia, Orlando, and Miami. The western US
dominates the highest hazard areas, but there are a few key
areas along the East coast that must be considered when
analyzing risk.
To quantify the threat in each of these metropolitan areas,
Figure 12 plots the number of cell transceivers in moderate,
high, and very high wildfire danger areas. The figure shows
that the WHP categories provide a rough prioritization guide
for how to expend prevention efforts. Most areas have more

Mod Dense; (center) WHP: Very High, High, Moderate with Population: Very Dense; (right) WHP: Very High with

with the high or moderate regions. Using this methodology
only increases the total number of cell transceivers in very
high, high, or moderate risk areas from 430,844 to 509,693,
an acceptable trade-off to more accurately determine cell
infrastructure risk.
Returning to the 2019 wildfire perimeters to assess the ben-
efit, using the WHP very high extended, high, and moderate
regions to identify cell infrastructure at risk correctly iden-
tifies 411 cell transceivers, which increases accuracy from
46% (302/656) to 62% (411/656). Of the 245 cell transceivers
located within wildfire perimeters, but not identified as at
risk in our extended risk areas, 203 are located within the
Saddle Ridge or Tick fire perimeters located just north of Los
Angeles. These fires combined to destroy 41 structures and
damage 115 structures. This damage highlights the impor-
tance of maintaining accurate maps of changes to the WUI,
expansion of cell infrastructure, and the wildfire risk in these
areas.
Summary of key findings. Extending the very high risk
areas identified by the WHP by 0.5 miles increases the num-
ber of correctly predicted at-risk cell transceivers from 46%
to 62%.
3.9 Future Changes to Wildfire Risk
Future wildfire activity will be affected by climate change,
but the effects will be unequally distributed across different
regions with different ecosystems. Therefore, modeling fu-
ture wildfire activity should take into consideration changes
in vegetation, precipitation, fuel availability, and warming
trends in different ecoregions. Littell et al. [23] use these
trends and multiple greenhouse gas emission scenarios to
create a simulation model of fire activity in the 2040s and
2080s for each of the Bailey ecoregions in the western US.
The results of their analysis identified specific ecoregions
that would see up to 240% increase in area burned by 2040
as well as areas that could see up to a 119% decrease in area
burned. Many locations projected to see the largest increase
in area burned are in the more rural areas of the country,
such as east of the Rocky Mountains. But, as people move to
Figure 12: Comparison of metro areas with the most
cell transceivers in wildfire danger.
Therefore, we examine the effects of a limited expansion of
areas we determine to be at risk beyond the very high, high,
and moderate WHP regions. One simple way to account for
some of this additional risk is to extend the risk area around
the very high risk WHP regions. Doing this helps to identify
additional cell infrastructure that could be at risk, but also
increases the amount of infrastructure that we would label
as being in danger.
If we extend only the very high WHP perimeters by half
a mile, that increases the number of cell transceivers con-
sidered highest risk from 26,307 to 176,275. To focus on the
highest threat infrastructure, we do not extend any of the
lower-risk WHP regions. Additionally, we remove any du-
plicates from the extended very high region that overlaps

Francisco/Sacramento, CA (left); Los Angeles/San Diego, CA (center); and Orlando, FL (right).

these less populated areas, additional cellular infrastructure
will be installed to support their activities. Understanding
the changes in wildfire activity will be crucial to installing
infrastructure in a robust fashion.
As an example of this analysis, we consider the region
east of Salt Lake City, UT to west of Denver, CO. This region
contains 13 different ecoregions. As seen in figure 14, most
cellular infrastructure in this region is concentrated in Salt
Lake City and Denver, but some is deployed along roads
between these cities, especially Interstate Highways 70 and
80, and some provides service for the less densely-populated
areas. The ecoregions annotated in lighter green are antici-
pated to see up to a 240% increase in wildfire area burned,
while the dark green ecoregions can expect to see up to a
132% increase in wildfire area burned. The tan ecoregion to
the west of Salt Lake City can anticipate a moderate increase
Figure 15: WHP with ecoregions and cellular infras-
tructure between Salt Lake City, UT and Denver, CO
of 43% in wildfire activity. In contrast, the dark brown region
can expect to see a 119% decrease in wildfire area burned.
The future regional changes to wildfire activity are most
noticeable when viewed in the context of the current wild-
fire threat, as represented by the WHP risk levels. The three
highest WHP risk levels are represented by the red, orange,
and yellow regions in Figure 15 showing the same region
between Salt Lake City and Denver. Much of these regions
are already under substantial wildfire risk, as captured by
the WHP risk levels. However, the ecoregion surrounding
Highway 80 is anticipated to see a sizable increase in wild-
fire activity, with up to 240% increase in area burned. The
cellular infrastructure along that highway must be appropri-
ately protected and maintained to reduce future risk. While
these timeframes are well beyond what current providers
consider, understanding these changes to wildfire risk will
nevertheless help to provide perspective in future planning
for cellular infrastructure deployment.
