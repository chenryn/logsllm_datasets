Fig. 5. Classiﬁable hops
per traceroute trace
When some VPs labeled an IP address as non−classiﬁable and the other VPs
judged the same address as classiﬁable, we did not consider it as a conﬂict. Our
VPs unanimously agreed about more than 97% of IPs labeling 51% of addresses
as classiﬁable and 47.6% as non−classiﬁable. Conﬂicting verdicts regarded a
limited number of IPs (1.4%) and were mainly caused by the removal of the TS
option on some reverse paths. Tab. 1 reports a breakdown of non−classiﬁable IPs
per category (see Sec. 3): our technique was unable to classify such IPs mostly
because of devices not replying (16.4%), ignoring the TS option (14.6%), or
belonging to the JUN category (10.4%). We also found 9 IPs exposing multiple
behaviors to distinct VPs, mainly caused by non−RFC compliant routers (a
phenomenon deeply investigated in [10]).
Besides non−classiﬁable hops, more than a half of IPs in the dataset were
classiﬁable by our technique. Adopting a per-trace point of view, Fig. 5 shows
the fraction of classiﬁable hops per trace (i) for each VP and (ii) over the
entire dataset: on average 4%, 52% and 30% hops are classiﬁable in each trace
respectively by the most ﬁltered node (Worst VP), the less ﬁltered one (Best
VP) and over the entire dataset. As reported in the following, although not all
the hops in each trace are classiﬁable, our technique allows to investigate the
TP addresses impact on traceroute applications.
Classiﬁcation Results. Most classiﬁable hops appeared in several paths from
multiple VPs toward multiple destinations. Fig. 6 shows the percentage of clas-
siﬁable IPs always classiﬁed as TP or OP and those classiﬁed as both (Mix), on
the paths in which they appeared. Such paths are aggregated in three diﬀerent
ways: paths originated (1.) by the same VP toward multiple destinations, (2.) by
multiple VPs toward a single destination, (3.) by multiple VPs toward multiple
destinations. The obtained results highlight an unexpected general trend: most
traceroute traces contain many more TP than OP addresses. Hence, according
to the router behavior described in Sec. 3, most of the intermediate routers en-
countered along the path reply to the traceroute originator using an interface
diﬀerent from the ones traversed by the packets sent to the targeted destination.
For both the aggregations 1 and 2, most of addresses were always classiﬁed as
TP or OP. However, some IPs were also variably classiﬁed and this phenomenon
is much more important in the aggregation 3. Such an evidence allows to con-
clude that the same address discovered with traceroute may lie or not on the
IP path depending on the (i) originating node and (ii) the targeted destination,
essentially due to both inter- and intra-domain routing.

Impact on Derived AS Links. While 224K IPs were classiﬁed at least once
as TP address, not all the TP addresses impact the AS-level links derived from
traceroute. Mapping each hop to the owner AS [9], we identiﬁed in our dataset
14, 783 diﬀerent ASes. In order to avoid ambiguities caused by the presence of
IXPs, we removed from our traces the hops associated to them according to the
datasets provided by peeringDB [22] and PCH [21]. From the resulting 34, 414
AS-level links, we removed 38 links involving sibling ASes according to [1].
Taking into account that the same AS link may appear in several traces toward
distinct destinations and depending on the involved IPs, a single AS link may be
associated to multiple classiﬁcations according to how the two involved IPs were
classiﬁed each time by our technique. In order to deal with this phenomenon, we
applied the following methodology: (1.) if both the involved IPs were classiﬁed
as OP at least once, we are conﬁdent that the corresponding AS link actually
exists; else, by adopting a conservative approach, (2.) if both the involved IPs
were non−classiﬁable by our technique at least once, we consider the link as
possible; ﬁnally, (3.) the AS links which always involved at least one TP address
are considered potentially false (see link ASx−ASz in Fig. 1). We counted 1, 897
existing links and 25, 990 possible links. On the other hand, we found 6, 299
potentially false AS links corresponding to about 17% of the links extracted
from the dataset.
AS-Level Loops. False AS links caused by TP addresses may also generate bo-
gus AS-level loops. In our dataset, we registered 587, 126 traces normally reaching

the destination, in which an AS-level loop appeared. Among these traces, about
4, 144 loops involved sibling ASes. Thanks to our technique, we discovered that
TP addresses are involved in at least 37% of such loops6: 105K and 149K loops
respectively started or ended with a TP address, while 6, 083 loops involved a se-
quence of consecutive TP addresses. For instance, considering the AS1 AS2 AS3
AS1 sequence, if AS2 and AS3 are associated to TP addresses, one possibility
is that the corresponding path is entirely contained in AS1, thus generating a
bogus loop.
4.3 Implications of the Results of Our Technique
The surprising high value of potentially false AS links suggests that TP addresses
can be a signiﬁcant source of AS maps distortion. Such conclusion conﬁrms the
one drawn by Zhang et al. [27] and is totally diﬀerent from the one given by
Hiun et al. [14]. Here, we investigated the basic reasons of such contradiction.
According to the heuristic method proposed by Hiun et al., a candidate TP
address is an intermediate hop that resolves to an AS that diﬀers from the ASes
of both adjacent IPs in the same path. The method takes into account also path
stability, AS ownerships and hostnames.
On the one hand, applying the Hiun’s method on our dataset, 7, 457 IPs
were classiﬁed as candidate TP addresses. Such addresses appeared in 56,595
diﬀerent IP1 IP2 IP3 sequences where all the IPs were mapped to diﬀerent
ASes and IP2 represents the candidate TP address. Each sequence appeared in
multiple traces and each time the involved IPs were classiﬁed by our technique7:
(i) 166 sequences resulted as real AS1 AS2 AS3 transitions, since all the three
IPs were classiﬁed at least once as OP; (ii) although the candidate TP address
was non−classiﬁable by our technique in 39, 824 sequences, in 15, 850 of them
we recognized as TP address the previous or the next hop, which could be the
real responsible of a false AS link; (iii) in the remaining 16, 605 sequences, our
technique always classiﬁed the central address as TP in 85% of cases (the two
techniques validate each other in such cases) and as OP in 14% of sequences (in
contradiction to the response of the Hiun’s method). In the last case, we also
found 52 sequences classiﬁed as both TP and OP depending on the traceroute
destination and the VP used.
On the other hand, only 1.5% of the TP addresses identiﬁed by our technique
is detected by the Hiun’s method. The main reason is that a TP address is
such independently from the AS point of view. In addition, a traceroute path
may contain multiple consecutive TP addresses – a possibility considered remote
in [14]. Considering the sequences of consecutive TP addresses detected in our
traces, Fig. 7 shows the distribution of their lengths. Globally, we registered
680K unique sequences: about 25% were isolated TP addresses, but more than
a half consisted of more than 3 consecutive TP addresses. As for ASy in Fig. 1,
6 Since we used a conservative approach, the real impact may be potentially wider.
7 As described above, the address identiﬁed by Hyun as candidate TP address may
eﬀectively lie or not on the IP path depending on the source and the destination.

if a traceroute path only crosses border routers exposing TP addresses mapped
to other ASes, consecutive TP addresses may entirely hide an AS from the path.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented and evaluated – to the best of our knowledge, for the
ﬁrst time in literature – an active probing technique able to identify TP addresses
in traceroute traces. Diﬀerently from most previous works, our technique does
not rely on information provided by BGP monitors and it allows to conclude
that TP addresses can be a signiﬁcant source of AS map distortion. Thanks to
a large scale measurement campaign, we draw the following general conclusions:
(i) the same address may be a TP address or not depending on the originating
host and the targeted destination; (ii) TP addresses may also be responsible
for bogus AS-level loops. We further observed that our technique was able to
classify more than half of the total discovered IPs and, surprisingly, about 17%
of traceroute-derived AS-level links were aﬀected by TP addresses, being thus
potentially false. Finally, our results conﬁrmed the conclusion drawn by Zhang
et al. [27] on the severity of this phenomenon and allowed to explain why such
conclusion conﬂicts with the one achieved by Hyun et al [14]: on our dataset, their
heuristic method was able to discover only 1.5% of the TP addresses recognized
by our technique.
In our ongoing work, we aim at quantifying the magnitude of the map dis-
tortion introduced when combining traceroute- and BGP-derived information to
infer the AS-level topology of Internet. We also plan to investigate if and how
TP addresses can explain known incongruities, such as extra, missing, and sub-
stitute hops arising when comparing the AS paths derived from traceroute with
the ones extracted from BGP monitors [27].
