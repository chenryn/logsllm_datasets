Let's take a look at the network capture:
```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/hackazon/CyberTank_Unsecured# tshark -r cybertank.pcap | head
Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.

```
The capture contained many HTTP streams, capturing an HTTP session.
At some stage, the user asks for a page which requires authorization:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/hackazon/CyberTank_Unsecured# tshark -r cybertank.pcap -qz follow,tcp,ascii,20
Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.

This uses the HTTP Authentication scheme.
The next stream shows the request after the user has entered his username and password:
```console

Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.

Accept-Language: nl-NL,nl;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7
```
The "Authorization (Basic)" header is basically a base-64 encoded string of the username and password, separated by a semicolon:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/hackazon/CyberTank_Unsecured# echo Y3liZXJ0YW5rOlN1cGVyQ3liZXJTZWNyZXQ= | base64 -d
cybertank:SuperCyberSecret
```
Therefore, the password is `SuperCyberSecret`.

We continue scanning through the PCAP file and find the following stream:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/hackazon/CyberTank_Unsecured# tshark -r cybertank.pcap -qz follow,tcp,ascii,42 | head -n 20
Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.
