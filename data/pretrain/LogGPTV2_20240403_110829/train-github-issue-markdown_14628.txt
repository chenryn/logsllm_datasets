### Bug report
**Bug summary**
After upgrading to 3.0.0, colormaps added to images with
mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.make_axes_locatable().append_axes overwrite the entire
image. This happens in a jupyter notebook with %matplotlib inline but not with
%matplotlib notebook. Also sometimes seen in scripts saving to .PNG (but I
cannot reproduce it today).
**Code for reproduction**
This should be run as a Jupyter Notebook so see the problem.
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable
    import numpy as np
    a = np.random.normal(size=(300,300))
    cmap = 'hot'
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,5))
    imshow = ax.imshow(a,cmap=cmap)
    divider = make_axes_locatable(ax)
    cax = divider.append_axes("right", size="5%", pad=0.05)
    plt.colorbar(imshow, cax=cax)
**Actual outcome**
The colorbar overwrites the entire image.
**Expected outcome**
A nice colorbar next to the image - it worked in v. 2.1.1 and I am 99% sure it
worked in later 2.X versions of matplotlib.
