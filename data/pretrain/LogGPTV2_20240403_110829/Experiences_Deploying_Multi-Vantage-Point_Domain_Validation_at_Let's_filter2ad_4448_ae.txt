and using a different combination of data centers for hosting
vantage points may further improve routing diversity. We
would like to inspect other cloud providers and data center
combinations in the future.
6.3 Simulating BGP Attacks on Domains
Next, we performed simulations of BGP hijacks using
the CAIDA AS-Relationship data set [4] to measure the
impact of multi-vantage-point domain control validation on
preventing BGP attacks against domains. In contrast to our
real-world attacks (that had limited locations for domains and
adversaries), simulations let us consider attacks from 1000
different randomly-sampled adversary ASes against real Let’s
Encrypt domains. In addition, we consider alternate vantage
points that have not been deployed by Let’s Encrypt.
6.3.1 Effective resilience
We use effective resilience [21] to measure the fraction of
adversaries (from a set of potential adversaries) that are
topologically incapable of obtaining a bogus certiﬁcate for a
given domain with an equally-speciﬁc BGP attack.7
For a given domain name d whose IP address is i, we
assume a set of adversaries A that each control a single
AS and aim to obtain a bogus certiﬁcate for d. For each
adversary a in A, we perform an Internet-topology simulation
of an equally-speciﬁc BGP hijack by a against the IP preﬁx
containing i. We use the result of this simulation to compute
α(a,d,v), which indicates whether a is capable of launching
a successful BGP attack to hijack trafﬁc from a given VA v
(selected from a VA set V ) to d. We deﬁne
0,If the BGP attack launched from a fails to
hijack Internet trafﬁc from v to i
1,otherwise
α(a,d,v) =
Next, we take quorum policy into consideration. The
quorum policy q is a function that takes the subset of vantage
points an adversary can hijack trafﬁc from (which is a subset
of V ) as an input and outputs either a 1 or a 0 depending
on whether this subset of vantage points is sufﬁcient to sign
a certiﬁcate. An output of 1 implies the adversary hijacked
trafﬁc from enough vantage points and the validation request
was successful and a 0 implies the attack did not lead to a
mis-issued certiﬁcate because validation did not succeed at
enough vantage points.
CAs may instantiate the quorum policy in different ways.
We primarily consider Let’s Encrypt’s quorum policy, which
can be expressed as:
1,If (primary VA ∈ W )
AND (|{remote VAs}∩ W | (cid:62) 2)
0,If otherwise
q(W ) =
We use α+(a,d,q) to denote whether a is capable of
launching successful BGP attacks against the CA under the
quorum policy. Then we have
α+(a,d,q) = q({v ∈ V |α(a,d,v) = 1})
Finally, we deﬁne the effective resilience for a domain
d which measures the fraction of adversaries that are
topologically incapable of fooling domain control validations
with equally speciﬁc attacks as
γ(d,q,V ,A) = 1− ∑a∈A α+(a,d,q)
|A|
The effective resilience of a domain is affected by the
quorum policy, and the number and location of adversary
ASes and remote VAs. In our simulation, we vary each
parameter to understand how each factor affects the resilience
to shed light on the possible directions for improving multiVA
to be more robust against domain validation attacks.
7This metric extends previous notions of AS-level resilience [34, 50] by
being domain speciﬁc (as opposed to AS speciﬁc) and measuring the impact
of multiple vantage points and quorum policy.

6.3.2 Novel preﬁx-level simulations of BGP attacks
Our simulations are based on modeling equally-speciﬁc preﬁx
attacks with the Gao-Rexford model of AS routing prefer-
ences [28] and are ostensibly similar to previous simulation
work [34] but with several signiﬁcant improvements. First,
unlike previous approaches which model a cloud provider
with multiple data centers as a homogeneous entity, our
simulations are at the ﬁner granularity of IP preﬁxes. Second,
we augment the CAIDA AS relationship data [4] with AWS’s
upstream links inferred from the bdrmap tool [38]. Finally,
we populated victim domains based on the real-world domain
dataset from Let’s Encrypt.
AS-level simulation fails to capture routing diversity.
Prior work on Internet topology simulation simulates routing
at the granularity of ASes, and considers each of the
geographically-distributed cloud (or content) providers as a
single homogeneous network [21, 34]. However, such coarse-
grained simulation and oversimpliﬁcation fails to capture
the path diversity of cloud providers. Many major cloud
providers use a single AS number for all of their globally-
distributed data centers, even though each of those data centers
has a different set of neighboring ASes. For example, the
routes to all AWS data centers are announced via AS 16509.
Furthermore, AWS’s documentation explains that not all AWS
IP preﬁxes are announced at all points of presence (instead
only local IP preﬁxes are announced in each region) [2].
CloudFlare also has a similar setup with AS 13335.
Measuring the diversity of different data centers within
the same AS is crucial as Let’s Encrypt’s remote vantage
points are all deployed in AWS. AS-level simulations would
inaccurately count Let’s Encrypt’s three AWS vantage points
as if they were a single location, and thus fail to capture the
resulting security beneﬁts of multiVA.
Improving simulation accuracy with preﬁx-level Internet-
topology simulation. To address the issues in the AS-level
simulation, we develop a novel ﬁner-grained simulation
framework that operates at the granularity of IP preﬁxes and
can more accurately model the routing behaviors of cloud
providers.
For a cloud provider that has a similar routing setup to AWS,
we use a combination of BGP data [11, 13] and the bdrmap
tool [38] to construct a unique list of peers/providers for each
of its data centers. Then, we use BGP data to observe which
providers’ AS numbers are being used for speciﬁc preﬁxes,
and simulate those preﬁxes as only being announced through
those providers. This allows us to capture how different data
centers (of the same cloud provider) select different BGP
routes for the same destination preﬁx.
We also consider AS-path prepending [39]
in our
simulations. Recent work has shown that AS-path prepending,
where an AS intentionally lengthens the AS-path it announces
to certain neighbors, has a substantial negative impact
on the resilience of IP preﬁxes against real-world BGP

hijacks [39]. To capture the AS-path prepending behaviors,
we measure how many times the origin AS for a given IP
preﬁx prepends its announcement to each provider, and apply
the same provider-speciﬁc prepending when simulating the
announcements of each IP preﬁx.
We applied these preﬁx-level simulations to the preﬁxes for
the IP addresses seen in our domain data set to model BGP
hijacks against Let’s Encrypt customer domains.
6.3.3 Security evaluation results
We compare the distribution of domain resilience under
multiVA to several different alternative deployments and a
single-vantage-point deployment under a range of simulation
parameters. Our analysis shows that Let’s Encrypt’s current
multiVA deployment greatly improves the security of the
CA over the status-quo single-VA system. The results
presented later in this section show that the current
system achieves the goal of making the vast majority of
ASes on the Internet (>90%) topologically incapable of
launching BGP attacks against the majority of domains.
Furthermore, if we consider the domains most vulnerable
to BGP attacks (i.e., the bottom 10th percentile), multiVA
shows a ﬁve-fold improvement in resilience. An expansion
of multiVA that uses one additional vantage point with the
existing k = n−1 quorum policy brings the median resilience
up to .97 meaning that under these proposed modiﬁcations,
the median domain is resilient to attacks from 97% of
ASes on the Internet.
Comparing multiVA to Let’s Encrypt’s previous deploy-
ment. Comparing the resilience of domains against BGP
attacks from randomly chosen ASes, we ﬁnd that multiVA
increases the median domain resilience to 0.94 (up from
0.62) when compared to Let’s Encrypt’s previous deployment
(see Figure 13). This improvement is even more signiﬁcant
for the domains most vulnerable to BGP attacks. Under

30th USENIX Security Symposium    4323
.32.62.99.94.10.71.51Let’s Encrypt’s previous deployment, 10% of domains had
a resilience of only 0.10 or less. With multiVA, the 10th
percentile is brought up ﬁve fold to a resilience of 0.51.
While this improvement is substantial, multiVA has the
potential to further improve domain resilience with some
relatively small modiﬁcations. We discuss two additional
ways to improve multiVA.
Impact of a full quorum policy. While a 0.94 median
domain resilience is a signiﬁcant improvement over the status-
quo, resilience can be further improved by strengthening
the quorum policy (which has no impact on operating
cost). Moving from an 2-3 quorum to a full quorum (3-3)
further enhances the median resilience to 0.98. While worth
considering, a stricter quorum policy also comes at the price
of higher benign failures which could potentially outweigh
the security beneﬁts.
Improving resilience by adding vantage points. An
alternative way of improving the security of multiVA is to
add additional vantage points while maintaining the quorum
policy (k = n− 1). We considered four different AWS data
centers for the potential locations of additional vantage
points—London, Paris, Tokyo, and Singapore—and computed
the effective resilience of domains under Let’s Encrypt’s
quorum policy with these additional vantage points.
Compared to Let’s Encrypt’s current deployment, adding
a vantage point in Paris (the optimal location among
the potential vantage points we studied) increased median
resilience to 0.975 (meaning 97.5% of ASes on the Internet
are topologically incapable of launching attacks against
the median domain). We further experimented with adding
an additional vantage point in Singapore (the optimal location
we found for a second vantage point after Paris) and found the
median resilience to only increase to 0.977. A similar story is
found with the 10th percentile domain: adding Paris improves
resilience from 0.51 to .67, but further adding Singapore only
improves resilience to 0.71.
With diminishing security returns and a constant cost
increase associated with adding an additional vantage point,
we recommend adding one additional vantage point which
offers a comparable resilience improvement to the full quorum
policy while maintaining the operational advantages—lower
latency and a lower benign failure rate—of the current (looser)
quorum policy.
Additionally, if maximum security is needed, operating one
additional vantage point with a full quorum policy brings the
median resilience to .99 (offering resilience against attacks
from 99% of adversaries) and improves the 10th percentile
resilience seven fold to 0.71.
Overall, our evaluation results suggest
that multiVA
effectively reduces the number of ASes that are capable
of launching BGP attacks on domain validation, which
substantially raises the bar for successful domain validation
attacks even for well-provisioned adversaries (e.g., nation-
state adversaries). Our future work will consider further
strengthening multiVA by adding additional vantage points.
7 Related Work
Routing attacks on critical applications. It is well known
that attackers can exploit the insecurity of Internet routing
(BGP) to hijack or intercept communications [18, 31, 40]. In
fact, numerous routing attacks occur in the wild, and these
attacks are getting more widespread and sophisticated [41,42,
48]. However, most prior works analyzed these attacks from
the viewpoint of availability and surveillance of unencrypted
communications. A recent line of work has shown that
routing attacks can compromise the security of important
Internet infrastructure such as certiﬁcate authorities. Birge-
Lee et al. [21] systematically analyzed the threat of routing
attacks against the domain control validation protocol,
demonstrating the ease of fraudulently obtaining certiﬁcates
for a target victim domain from major certiﬁcate authorities.
Gavrichenkov [29] also explored the use of BGP attacks
to fraudulently obtain valid TLS certiﬁcates. These works
motivate our deployment of multi-vantage-point domain
validation, which substantially reduces the attack surface of
BGP attacks against CAs. In similar spirit to BGP attacks
on certiﬁcate authorities, Sun et al. [52] and Apostolaki
et al. [17] demonstrated routing attacks against critical
infrastructure such as the Tor anonymity network and the
Bitcoin crypto-currency network. These networks can also
beneﬁt from the concept of multiple vantage points.
Defenses against routing attacks. There have been
substantial efforts in the industry and research community
to defend against routing attacks [9, 12, 14, 24, 27, 32, 36,
43, 49, 51], but unfortunately, the current status quo leaves
CAs vulnerable to attacks. First, defenses based on BGP
monitoring [12, 14] monitor the control plane of Internet
routing to check for suspicious announcements. However, it is
very challenging to accurately classify BGP announcements
as legitimate or illegitimate. Furthermore, such approaches
merely aid in attack detection, and cannot prevent attacks
and the resulting issuance of fraudulent TLS certiﬁcates.
Second, defenses based on route ﬁltering, such as MANRS [9]
and peer locking [49], use out-of-band information about
the Internet topology to ﬁlter bogus BGP announcements.
However, the deployment of ﬁltering-based solutions is not
widespread, and this approach does not provide a bulletproof
security solution due to the difﬁculty of scaling out-of-band
information sharing. Third, cryptographic mechanisms like
RPKI [24] and BGPSEC [36] have been proposed to fully
authenticate BGP announcements. While such cryptographic
techniques could eliminate the threat of BGP attacks, RPKI
is only partially deployed, and BGPSec has not seen any
deployment. A recent proposal by Hlavacek et al. (known
as DISCO [32]) proposes to overcome the slow deployment
4324    30th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
of RPKI by settling for “de facto” ownership (as opposed
to the formal legal ownership required by RPKI), but this
has not yet seen deployment. Note that RPKI and DISCO
only prevent an adversary from claiming ownership of an
IP preﬁx, but do not prevent an adversary from advertising
a bogus path to the preﬁx owner [31]. Finally, new Internet
architectures like SCION [56] have been designed from the
ground up to eliminate the threat of routing attacks. While
SCION has made great strides in adoption, its use is still not
widespread. We hope that our work on securing CAs against
routing attacks provides much-needed momentum for ﬁxing
the insecurity of Internet routing.
Enhancing security of CAs. Recent work has made
signiﬁcant improvements in standardizing and securing the
process of issuing TLS certiﬁcates [16, 20, 21, 23, 53, 54].
Birge-Lee et al. [21] discussed the idea of multi-vantage-point
domain control validation, which served as a motivation for
our work and deployment. A similar idea was also explored
