It would be great to see the Canny edge detector available in `scipy.ndimage`.
Implementations exist in
  * `cv2` (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgproc/src/canny.cpp)
  * `scikit-image` (https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/master/skimage/feature/_canny.py)
Perhaps one of these could be ported here?
