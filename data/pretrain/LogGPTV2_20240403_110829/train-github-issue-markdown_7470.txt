### Issue Details
This is incredibly similar to #26888 , but IMHO it cannot be a 100% duplicate
since according to the bisect the last known good version is `3.1.13` and the
first known bad version is `4.0.0-beta.1.`, whereas the other one has a
different timeline. Also, this one is on the mac, while the other one is on
Windows.
  * **Electron Version:**
    * `4.0.0-beta.1.` and above
  * **Operating System:**
    * macOS 10.15.7
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:**
    * `3.1.13`
### Expected Behavior
  * When using a keyboard layout like `Spanish - ISO` on macOS, `Cmd+Shift+7` in an accelerator should be rendered as `Cmd+Shift+7` or as `Cmd+/`. Here is a screenshot of the Spanish - ISO keyboard layout. As you can see, `Shift+7` on the `Spanish - ISO` keyboard layout produces `/` and not `&` (like on the US keyboard layout):

### Actual Behavior
  * Since Electron `4.x`, `Cmd+Shift+7` is always rendered as `Cmd+&` (or for a while as `Cmd+Shift+&`?) which is only correct for keyboard layouts where `Shift+7` produces `&`, such as the US keyboard layout, but is incorrect and misleading for any other keyboard layout.
### To Reproduce
  * Electron Fiddle that uses `cmd+shift+7` as an accelerator: https://gist.github.com/f9dd95b576133c293fe7ad9a5fccb154
  * Switch the keyboard layout to `Spanish - ISO` on macOS
relevant code snippet:
      const template = [
        {
          label: 'Edit',
          submenu: [
            { label: 'Test', accelerator: 'Cmd+Shift+7' },
          ]
        }
      ]
      const menu = Menu.buildFromTemplate(template)
      Menu.setApplicationMenu(menu)
### Screenshots
  * `3.1.13` (last known good version):

### Additional Information
  * As I mentioned, this is incredibly similar to #26888 but appears to have been introduced one version later in Electron
