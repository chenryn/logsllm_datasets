Assistant: This log chunk shows the status of a switch module over a period of time. It begins with the link being ok on December 26th, followed by the link being ok on December 28th and then going into reset. The link then goes back to being ok on December 28th, but then goes into an error state on December 29th. The link then goes back to being ok on January 4th, but then goes into an error state on January 3rd. The link then goes back to being ok on January 7th, followed by being ok on January 5th and January 4th. The link then goes into reset on January 13th, January 12th, and January 12th. The link then goes into an error state on January 14th, followed by two more error state events and an action error. The log ends with the link going into an error state on January 14th.
