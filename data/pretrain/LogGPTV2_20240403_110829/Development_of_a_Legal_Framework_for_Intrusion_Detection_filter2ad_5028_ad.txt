Prior  to  the  introduction  of  anti-terrorism  legislation,  the  interception  of  private
communications was conducted in accordance with strict  rules.    Specific  conditions
had to be met before an authorization could be granted, and strict conditions applied
to the actual conduct of the interception.  Interception was also generally limited to
telephone  communications.    This  tended  to  restrict  the  circumstances  in  which
interception could be conducted. For instance, a wiretap order only applied to a single
telephone  number.  There  was  some  judicial  discretion  with  respect  to  granting  or
denying  requests  for  authorization.    This  combination  provided  a  certain  degree  of
assurance that the privacy of network communications would not be violated without
cause.
In the wake of the September 11 attacks, there were calls to grant law enforcement
agencies  much  broader  powers  to  monitor  private  communications  and  access
personal  information.    The  bills  generally  responded  to  these  calls  by  amending
existing  criminal  law  provisions  governing  interception  of  private  communications.
The  nature  of  the  information  that  can  be  captured  has  been  broadened  to  include
dialing,  routing  and  addressing  information,  effectively  enabling  law  enforcement
agencies  to  monitor  and  intercept  electronic  mail,  web  surfing  and  other  forms  of
electronic communications.35 Law enforcement agencies are now permitted to obtain

a single authorization to tap any communications that a suspect may use.   Combined
with  claims  that  the  level  of  judicial  discretion  has  essentially  been  drastically
reduced, this has prompted fears of the potential for massive invasions of privacy36.
Whether these fears are justified or not, the amendments still do not provide a general
authorization for interception of network communications by public and private sector
organizations – they must still operate under the prior, more restrictive regime.
There  appear,  however,  to  be  two  exemptions  to  the  above  statement.    The  first
comes  in  Canada’s  Anti-Terrorism  Act.    This  Act  includes  a  specific  clause
authorizing intercept of private communications for the purposes of protecting  GoC
computers and networks. 37  However, this clause only applies to a single government
agency (CSE) and then only under strict conditions, similar to those in the Criminal
Code.38  An authorization made under this section may contain any conditions that the
Minister considers advisable to protect the privacy of Canadians, including additional
measures to restrict the use and retention of, the access to, and the form and manner
of  disclosure  of,  information  derived  from  the  private  communications.  There  is  at
least  an  indication,  therefore,  that  attempts  will  be  made  to  respect  the  privacy  of
network communications.
It is important to remember, however, that this authorization can only be provided
to CSE, leaving all other GoC departments and agencies without a specific legislative
basis for the conduct of intrusion detection.  Provision does exist  within  the  act  for
persons  who  assist  with  the  execution  of  the  authorization  to  be  covered  by  the
authorization39,  but  the  implications  of  this  for  the  GoC,  from  an  operational
perspective, have yet to be examined.
The second exception is a provision in the USA PATRIOT Act, which amends US
Code to add a provision that “it shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person
acting  under  color  of  law  to  intercept  the  wire  or  electronic  communications  of  a
computer  trespasser  transmitted  to,  through,  or  from  the  protected  computer,  if  the
owner  or  operator  of  the  protected  computer  authorizes  the  interception  of  the
computer  trespasser’s  communications    on  the  protected  computer;  and  such
interception does not acquire communications other than those transmitted to or from
the computer trespasser.’’40
At first glance, this would appear to provide, in the United States at least, owners
of  a  protected  computer41  the  legal  right  to  intercept  private  communications.

However, it may not be as simple as that.  First, the definition of protected computer
appears  to  be  fairly  narrow,  being  a  computer  that  is  exclusively  for  the  use  of  a
financial institution or the United States Government or which is used in interstate or
foreign commerce or communication.  In relation to the private sector, for instance,
what  computers  would  this  cover  –  individual  workstations,  web  or  mail  servers
(which could arguably be for foreign communication)?  The answer to this question is
not at all clear.

logging  of  specific
communications, or to the copying of communications performed by an IDS prior to
scanning, IDS are not sufficiently discriminating to ensure that only communications
from the computer trespasser will be ‘acquired’. There does not appear to be any issue
with  the  IDS  sensor  scanning  network  traffic  looking  for  indications  of  malicious
activity and generating alerts/alarms as a result of the scanning.  The problems appear
to arise when a human analyst must examine any flagged traffic to validate the alarm
(i.e. is it a valid alarm, or a false positive?).  Even if they only log traffic deemed to be
malicious,  the  current  state  IDS  technology  almost  guarantees  that  at  least  some  of
this traffic will be benign (i.e. false positives), thereby violating this condition.  In the
absence  of  judicial  interpretation  of  this  provision,  it  is  unlikely  that  organizations
could generally rely upon it for legal authority to intercept private communications.
6.2   Data Retention
The  second  controversial  provision  in  most  anti-terrorism  law  concerns  data
retention.42    A  distinction  must  be  made  between  data  preservation,  where  data  is
stored and retained in response to a specific request and data retention, where the data
is  stored  as  a  routine  practice.    As  a  general  rule,  there  seems  to  be  very  little
controversy  associated  with  data  preservation.    On  the  other  hand,  data  retention  is
causing a great deal of concern, especially among ISPs.  Prior to the introduction of
the anti-terrorism legislation, traffic data was only retained as long as was necessary
for  billing  purposes,  and  at  the  end  of  that  period  was  either  to  be  anonymized  or
destroyed.  Combined with the increasing trend to billing flat rates for network access,
this ensured that a minimum of private information was collected and stored.
The  anti-terrorism  legislation  not  only  increased  the  duration  for  which  this
information  had  to  be  stored,  it  also  considerably  expanded  the  information  to  be
retained43,  although  it  appears  as  if  it  is  predominantly  traffic  data  that  is  to  be
42 Provisions for data retention are also found elsewhere.  See e.g.: Anonymous, “Proposal for a
Directive  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  concerning  the  processing  of
personal  data  and  the  protection  of  privacy  in  the  electronics  communications  sector”,
document  reference  /*COM/2000/0385  final  –  COD  2000/0189*/  (replacing  Directive
97/66/EC,  adopted  15  December  1997).    This  proposal  was  accepted  in  a  vote  in  the
European Parliament 30 May 2002.

(File No. 5121-20020411LR-Questionnaire).  The list of information to be retained is quite
extensive:  user-id  and  password  (remote  login);  sender  and  receiver  (login@domain),
identifying information of e-mail retrieved (e-mail); and hostname or IP address, nickname
used during session (IRC).

retained.    While  this  was  aimed  at  e-mails  and  web  traffic,  there  is  no  reason  to
suppose  that  data  collected  by  IDS  would  not  be  covered  by  these  provisions,  as  it
likely  falls  within  the  definition  of  traffic  data.    While  this  poses  a  number  of  data
storage and management problems, it also poses problems with respect to privacy of
network communications.  As mentioned, IDS are prone to generating false positives.
Unless  procedures  are  in  place  to  examine  all  of  the  flagged  traffic,  and  then  to
destroy  that  which  is  determined  to  be  benign,  examination  of  the  logged  data  will
almost  certainly  result  in  privacy  violations.    Even  if  the  data  is  anonymized,  it  is
likely  that  law  enforcement  agencies  would  require  its  association  with  a  particular
originator  for  investigative  purposes  (if  provisions  exist  to  force  disclosure  of
encryption keys, then requiring this association is likely to follow).
7   Conclusions
This paper has looked at some of the issues that will need to be addressed in order to
develop a general legal framework for use of IDS, including trying to define what is
meant by a ‘private communication’.  Depending on the nature of the communication,
the  originator  might  want  to  hide  the  content  of  the  communication  (through
cryptography), the fact that a communication has taken place (through anonymization
or  pseudonymization)  or  both.  The  use  of  encryption  to  ensure  the  privacy  of  the
contents of a communication is no longer an assurance that the contents will in fact
remain  private  –  legislation  exists  to  force  the  disclosure  of  encryption  keys.
Similarly,  the  use  of  pseudonymizing  techniques  is  no  guarantee  that  the  fact  of  a
communication will remain private – most schemes permit  the  re-association  of  the
pseudonymized  traffic  with  the  originator.    An  attempt  to  legislate  the  creation  and
retention  of  similar  records  by  providers  of  anonymizing  services  is  not  beyond
possibility.  If  law  enforcement  agencies  decide  that  IDS  data  is  essential  to  their
investigation,  there  is  little  reason  to  believe  that  they  will  not  require  this
reassociation.
IDS log data probably falls within the definition of traffic data, and is, therefore,
probably subject to the provisions of legislation that require the long-term retention of
traffic data by service providers.  If this is the case, this poses numerous challenges
for the service providers, and creates an increased risk of privacy violations.
Based on the definitions found in criminal law and supporting legislation, the use
of IDS by public and private sector organizations will likely constitute an intercept.
In order not to be an offense, the use of IDS must be in accordance with one of the
exemptions, namely where consent to the interception, express or implied, has been
given by the originator of the private communication or the intended recipient; where
an authorization has been obtained; or where the interception is by a person engaged
in providing a telephone, telegraph or other communication service to the public.
These provisions do not adequately address the situation facing public and private
sector organizations.  Single party (i.e. recipient) consent, although lawful, has been
held  to  violate  constitutional  law.    Two  party  consent  is  considered  the  minimum
standard  –  something  that  will  not  be  achieved  if  one  of  the  parties  to  the
communication has malicious intent.  While satisfying the conditions necessary to the
granting of an authorization should generally be possible, authorizations issued under
criminal law are for evidence collection, not network protection.  It is unlikely that a
global,  open-ended  authorization  for  network  protection  would  (or  could)  ever  be
154         S.R. Johnston
granted  under  criminal  law  or  withstand  legal  challenge.  Narrower  authorizations
issued under the Anti-Terrorism Act (Canada) or to law enforcement or S&I agencies
to  intercept  private  communications  for  network  protection  (i.e.  conduct  intrusion
detection) would be more likely to withstand challenge.
In  a  limited  sense,  a  case  could  be  made  for  the  application  of  the  criminal  law
