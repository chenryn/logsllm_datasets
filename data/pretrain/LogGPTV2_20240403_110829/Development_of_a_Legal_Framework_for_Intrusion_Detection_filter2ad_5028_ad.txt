### Prior Rules and Procedures for Interception of Private Communications

Before the introduction of anti-terrorism legislation, the interception of private communications was governed by strict rules. Specific conditions had to be met before an authorization could be granted, and stringent conditions applied to the actual conduct of the interception. Generally, interception was limited to telephone communications, which restricted the circumstances in which it could be conducted. For example, a wiretap order typically applied to a single telephone number. Judicial discretion played a role in granting or denying requests for authorization. This combination provided a degree of assurance that the privacy of network communications would not be violated without cause.

### Changes Post-September 11

Following the September 11 attacks, there were calls to grant law enforcement agencies broader powers to monitor private communications and access personal information. The resulting bills generally responded by amending existing criminal law provisions governing the interception of private communications. The scope of information that could be captured was expanded to include dialing, routing, and addressing information, effectively enabling law enforcement to monitor and intercept electronic mail, web surfing, and other forms of electronic communications. Law enforcement agencies are now permitted to obtain a single authorization to tap any communications that a suspect may use. Combined with claims that judicial discretion has been drastically reduced, this has raised concerns about potential massive invasions of privacy.

### Legislative Responses

#### United States
The USA PATRIOT Act, signed into law on October 26, 2001, amended the definitions of pen register and trap and trace devices to permit the recording of dialing, routing, and addressing information, though restrictions on the recording of communications content still apply.

#### Canada
Canada's Bill C-36, also known as the Anti-Terrorism Act, came into force on December 24, 2001. This act includes a specific clause authorizing the interception of private communications for the protection of government computers and networks. However, this clause applies only to the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) and under strict conditions similar to those in the Criminal Code. An authorization made under this section can include conditions to protect the privacy of Canadians, such as additional measures to restrict the use and retention of, access to, and the form and manner of disclosure of, information derived from private communications.

#### United Kingdom
The UK’s Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act became law on December 14, 2001. Similar to the US and Canadian laws, it expanded the scope of information that could be intercepted and monitored.

### Privacy Concerns and Legal Frameworks

Despite these amendments, general authorization for the interception of network communications by public and private sector organizations remains subject to the prior, more restrictive regime. There are, however, two notable exceptions:

1. **Canada’s Anti-Terrorism Act**: This act allows the CSE to intercept private communications for protecting government computers and networks, but only under strict conditions. This authorization can include measures to protect privacy, such as restricting the use and retention of intercepted information.

2. **USA PATRIOT Act**: This act includes a provision allowing the interception of communications from a computer trespasser if authorized by the owner or operator of the protected computer. However, the definition of a "protected computer" is narrow, and the interception must be limited to the communications of the trespasser, posing challenges for IDS technology, which may not be sufficiently discriminating.

### Data Retention

Another controversial provision in anti-terrorism laws concerns data retention. A distinction must be made between data preservation, where data is stored in response to a specific request, and data retention, where data is stored as a routine practice. While data preservation is generally uncontroversial, data retention has raised significant concerns, especially among ISPs. Prior to the anti-terrorism legislation, traffic data was retained only for billing purposes and was anonymized or destroyed afterward. The new laws have increased the duration and scope of data retention, including extensive traffic data, which poses both storage and privacy challenges.

### Conclusions

Developing a legal framework for the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) requires addressing several issues, including the definition of a "private communication." Depending on the nature of the communication, the originator might want to hide the content (through encryption), the fact of the communication (through anonymization), or both. The use of encryption and anonymization is no longer a guarantee of privacy due to legislative provisions that can force the disclosure of encryption keys and re-association of pseudonymized traffic.

IDS log data likely falls within the definition of traffic data and is subject to long-term retention requirements, posing numerous challenges for service providers and increasing the risk of privacy violations. The use of IDS by public and private sector organizations will likely constitute an intercept, and to avoid being an offense, it must be in accordance with one of the exemptions, such as consent, authorization, or by a person providing a communication service to the public. These provisions do not adequately address the situation facing organizations, and narrower authorizations issued under anti-terrorism acts may be more likely to withstand legal challenge.
