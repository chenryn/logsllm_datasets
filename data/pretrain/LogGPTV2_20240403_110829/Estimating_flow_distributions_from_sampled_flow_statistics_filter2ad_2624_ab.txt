speed routers carrying fewer ﬂows (e.g. edge routers), packet sam-
pling is not expected to be so necessary for ﬂow formation in this
case. In Section 3 we test these expectations by implementing in-
dependent and periodic sampling algorithms on packet level traces.
2.4 General Flows and TCP ﬂows
(cid:1)
(cid:2)
Under independent sampling of packets with probability p, the
number of packets k sampled from an original ﬂow of (cid:2) packets
pk(1 − p)(cid:2)−k. In
follows the binomial distribution Bp((cid:2), k) =
many implementations p = 1/N where N is an integer. In this
paper we will assume this to be the case, although the conclusion,
and usually the proofs, hold independently of this assumption.

k
For TCP ﬂows, additional information is available in the ﬂow
statistics, at least in NetFlow statistics. The TCP protocol signals
the start and end of connections with packets that are distinguished
by ﬂags in the TCP header; see e.g.
[6]. The ﬁrst packet of a
connection has a SYN ﬂag set; the last has the FIN ﬂag set. A
NetFlow statistic includes the cumulative OR of the code bits of
ﬂow’s packets. By inspecting the code bits of the ﬂow, we may
determine whether a given ﬂag was set in any packet of the ﬂow.
We will refer to a packet with a SYN ﬂag set as a SYN packet, and
a ﬂow containing a SYN packet as a SYN ﬂow. Here we assume:
• original TCP ﬂows are well-behaved in the sense that they
contain exactly one SYN packet.
Under this assumption, the probability that a sampled SYN ﬂow
contains a SYN packet is p, the average packet sampling proba-
bility. In Section 3.3 we will ﬁnd that NetFlow traces support the
assumption that TCP ﬂows include at least one SYN packet.
In
packet traces, an overwhelming majority of TCP ﬂows that con-
tained at least one SYN packet, contained exactly one.
In Section 4 we show that the numbers of measured SYN ﬂows
of can be used to estimate the number of original TCP ﬂows that
were not sampled at all, and hence the total number of original
TCP ﬂows. Exploiting the information in the distribution of short
sampled SYN ﬂows is essential to making accurate prediction of
the distribution of short original ﬂows for scaling-based inference.
Although the method applies only to TCP trafﬁc, this is the ma-
jority of Internet trafﬁc.
In one of the traces used in this study,
FLOW, TCP trafﬁc comprises 76% of the ﬂows, 84% of the packets,
and 95% of the bytes. Furthermore, the TCP-speciﬁc scaling-based
method does offer some advantages of the EM-based method in es-
timating the total number of ﬂows. The relative advantages of the
two methods are discussed in Section 9.
A parallel methodology could be based on FIN ﬂags, since all
TCP sessions should end with a FIN packet. However, there may
be many ﬂows for which this is not the case: a SYN-ﬂooding denial
of service attack that employs ﬂows comprising one SYN packet.
2.5 Sparse Flows and Splitting
Packet sampling can actually increase the number of measured
ﬂows in some circumstances. Given a sampling period N and a
ﬂow interpacket timeout T , we say that a given original ﬂow of
packets is sparse if the typical time between sampled packets ex-
ceeds T . In this case, a single original ﬂow may give rise to multi-
ple ﬂow statistics. Consider an original ﬂow comprising n pack-
ets distributed over an interval of duration t. The typical time
between sampled packets is tN/n, thus sparseness requires that
tN/(nT ) > 1. It also requires that there is typically more than one
sampled packet, i.e., n/N > 1. Combining, we can say that the
threshold for sparseness is crossed when
t/T > n/N > 1.
(1)
Sparseness is most likely to arise in ﬂows containing many packets
occurring with relatively low frequency. It is found that streaming
and multimedia applications can generate sparse ﬂows for settings
of the sampling parameters within a likely operating range: sam-
pling period N = 100 and ﬂow interpacket timeout T = 30s; [9].
The potential for ﬂow splitting has ramiﬁcations for the present
work. Suppose a sparse original ﬂow is split by sampling into a
number of sampled measured subﬂows. With no additional infor-
mation other than the ﬂow lengths, the best we can hope is to infer
the distribution of the lengths of a notional set of original subﬂows,
whose combined length is that of the original ﬂow. Thus in the
presence of splitting, we will tend to infer more, and shorter, ﬂows
than were actually present. There are three ways to ameliorate this:
Suppression of splitting: increasing the ﬂow interpacket timeout
suppresses splitting; from (1) ﬂows are less sparse. However, this
remedy has the potential side effect of combining sampled mea-
sured ﬂows with the same key that came from distinct original
ﬂows. Also, buffer requirements for the ﬂow cache are increased.
In general, it may be desirable to systematically change the ﬂow
interpacket timeout according to the sampling rate.
Surgery on ﬂows: if there is no control over the ﬂow timeout, an-
other possibility is to emulate the effects of increasing timeout by
joining ﬂows with matching keys, qualiﬁed by semantic informa-
tion provided in the ﬂow records. For example, a measured TCP
ﬂow containing a SYN packet signiﬁes a starting TCP connection,
so should not be joined to a preceding ﬂow with matching key.
Exploiting protocol information: Since the SYN packet at the start
of a TCP ﬂow is sampled with probability p, the number of origi-
nal TCP ﬂows can be estimated from the number of sampled SYN
ﬂows. This limits the amount of surgery that should be performed.
2.6 Experimental Packet and Flow Data
The experimental portion of this work was performed using four
packet traces and a ﬂow trace. Trace PEERING was derived from
10,000,000 IP packets seen at a peering link during a period of 37
minutes. Trace CAMPUS was derived from 10,065,600 IP packets
seen at LAN near the border of a campus network during a pe-
riod of 300 minutes. Trace ABILENE was collected from an OC48c
link in the Abilene network. This study used 532,567,007 UDP
and TCP packets present during a 2 hour period in the westbound
direction of the Abilene-I IPLS-CLEV trace. Trace COS was col-
lected at an OC3 link at Colorado State University. This study used
approximately 37 million packets collected during January 25 and
26, 2003; this period was chosen to overlap the onset of the Slam-
mer worm [17], to support the work of Section 8. Further details on
ABILENE and COS can be found at [18]. Trace FLOW comprised un-
sampled raw NetFlow statistics collected in an aggregation network
during 1 day in September 2002. There were 229,448,460 records,
representing 6,009,481,415 packets and 3,107,927,460,309 bytes.
The packet traces were used as input to applications which sam-
pled packets (either independently or periodically) and formed ﬂow
statistics from the sampled stream. The ﬂow key comprised source
and destination IP addresses and TCP/UDP port numbers. The ﬂow

3. EVALUATING THE SAMPLING MODEL
We investigate the dependence of the frequencies of sampled
ﬂow lengths on whether periodic or simple random packet sam-
pling is employed. We can formulate this question at two levels.
First, we can ask whether the distributions obtained by different
sampling methods are statistically distinguishable; standard statis-
tical tests can be used to determine this. But even if two distribu-
tions are distinguishable, they may not differ to an extent that con-
cerns us in practice. Our second approach is to formulate a notion
of how two distributions might be “close enough” for the purposes
of applications using the distributions, and apply it to the measured
sampled ﬂow length distributions. In both cases we also investigate
the dependence of distinguishability on data size.
3.1 Distinguishing Distributions
Consider two set of sampled ﬂow length frequencies g = {gi :
i = 1, . . . , n} and g
(cid:2)} created from a
set of original ﬂows, g being produced with independent random
by periodic sampling. We take g as our reference
sampling, and g
distribution, and ask whether g
would be judged as arising from
the same distribution. The appropriate chi-squared statistic is:
: i = 1, . . . , n

We represent it through the associated one-sided chi-squared P-
value P (χ), i.e., the proportion of the time that a value of χ or
(cid:2)
greater would be obtained if g and g
were drawn from the same
distribution. In hypothesis testing we would ﬁx a signiﬁcance level
(cid:2)
(probability) P0 (e.g. 5%) and reject the (null) hypothesis—that g
is drawn from the same distribution as g—if P (χ) < P0.
Table 1 shows P (χ) for trace COS and subsets comprising the
ﬁrst 1/10th and 1/100th of the packets. Following the recommen-
dation of §4.3 in [23], we binned adjacent frequencies so as to be
no less than 5. The number of bins was 11 in one case, at least
71 in all others. Using a common signiﬁcance level P0 = 5% we
see that in many cases the two distributions are statistically distin-
guishable, except when N = 1, 000 or the smallest fraction of the
trace is used. This indicates persistent differences between the two
distributions that are not washed out by averaging over long traces.
The closer agreement for large N reﬂects that for higher sampling
periods the difference in the sampling algorithms tends to blur be-
cause most ﬂows that are sampled have only one packet sampled.
3.2 Distributional Discrepancies
(cid:2)
Although the length frequency distributions g and g
obtained by
random and periodic sampling can be distinguished, the differences
are, in fact, small. Figure 1 displays the frequencies distribution for

(cid:2)
ber of points with small g
the relative errors for the larger frequencies are small (1 in 100 or
smaller), they remain large enough to distinguish the distributions
even for large data sets. Such behavior will occur if, for example, a
small subset of the ﬂows are consistently treated differently in the
two sampling methods. Although we do not investigate the origin
of these discrepancies, a candidate subset is those ﬂow contain-
ing packets that are back-to-back in the original stream: successive
back to back packets can never both be periodically sampled.
It is desirable to capture the distributional discrepancies in a sin-
gle measure. Standard measures based on hypothesis tests (such
as those used in a related context in [19]) will blow up for large
datasets since even small persistent errors will eventually exceed
the likely statistical error.
i|/(gi + g
(cid:2)
We can deem the two distributions “close enough” for practical
purposes, if the typical relative difference between the frequencies
is sufﬁciently small. For a given length i, we normalize the absolute
difference between the frequencies by their mean value to obtain
the relative difference 2|gi − g
(cid:2)
i). To obtain the typical
relative difference over all i we average the relative differences that

weights them by the mean values (gi + g

for a larger frequency. Altogether, this resulted in the following
