We meet these challenges by ﬁrst factoring out the computational
aspects by a special treatment of ciphertexts. Then we use a new
bisimulation technique that includes a static information-ﬂow anal-
ysis, and is followed by the remaining cryptographic reductions.
The rigorous proof takes 30 pages [10]; hence we can only give a
very brief overview here, see also Figure 4.

• Introducing encryption machines. We use the two encryp-
tion machines EncH and Encsim,H from [49] to handle the
encryption and decryption needs of the system. Roughly, the
ﬁrst machine calculates the correct encryption of every mes-
sage m, whereas the second one always encrypts the ﬁxed
message 1
and answers decryption requests for the result-
ing ciphertexts by table look-up. By [49], EncH is at least
as secure as Encsim,H. We rewrite the machines Mu such
that they use EncH (Step 1 in Figure 4); this yields modiﬁed
(cid:2)
u. We then replace EncH by its idealized coun-
machines M
terpart Encsim,H (Step 2 in Figure 4) and use the composition
theorem to show that the original system is at least as secure
as the resulting system.
• Combined system. We now want to compare the combina-
(cid:2)
tion MH of the machines M
u and Encsim,H with the combi-
nation THSimH of the machines TH(H) and SimH. How-
ever, there is no direct invariant mapping between the states
of these two joint machines. Hence we deﬁning an interme-
diate system CH with a state space combined from both these
systems (Step 3 in Figure 4).
• Bisimulations with error sets and information-ﬂow analysis.
We show that the joint view of H and A is equal in interac-
tion with the combined machine CH and the two machines
THSimH and MH, except for certain runs, which we collect
in error sets. We show this by performing two bisimulations
simultaneously (Step 4 in Figure 4). Transitivity and sym-
metry of indistinguishability then yield the desired result for
THSimH and MH. Besides several normal state invariants of
CH, we also deﬁne and prove an information-ﬂow invariant
on the variables of CH.
• Reduction proofs. We show that the aggregated probability
of the runs in error sets is negligible, as we could otherwise
break the underlying cryptography. I.e., we perform reduc-
tion proofs against the security deﬁnitions of the primitives.
For signature forgeries and collisions of nonces or cipher-
texts, these are relatively straightforward proofs. For the fact
that the adversary cannot guess “ofﬁcial” nonces as well as
additional randomizers in signatures and ciphertext, we use
the information-ﬂow invariant on the variables of CH to show
that the adversary has no partial information about such val-
ues in situations where correct guessing would put the run in
an error set. This proves that MH is computationally at least
as secure as the ideal system (Step 5 in Figure 4).
Finally, simulatability is transitive [49]. Hence the original real
system is also as secure as the ideal system (Step 6 in Figure 4).
