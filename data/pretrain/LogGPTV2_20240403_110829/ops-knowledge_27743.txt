User: How to check the CPU load of the server? Please provide specific command line operation steps and analysis results.
Assistant: You can check the server's CPU load using the following steps and command line operations: 1. Connect to the server: Connect to the server using SSH. 2. Run the top command: Enter the top command in the terminal. 3. Analysis results: In the output of top, you can see the average CPU load (load average) and the usage of each CPU core. Generally, if the load average is higher than twice the number of CPU cores, the CPU load is high. Example output: ``` top - 00:23:48 up 5 days, 4:37, 1 user, load average: 4.21, 2.27, 1.48 Tasks: 225 total, 1 running, 223 sleeping, 0 stopped, 1 zombie %Cpu (s): 10.1 us, 0.5 sy, 0.0 ni, 89.3 id, 0.0 wa, 0.1 hi, 0.0 si, 0.0 st KiB Mem : 8163136 total, 3328176 free, 1075084 used, 3769876 buff/cache KiB Swa p: 0 total, 0 free, 0 used. 6554180 avail Mem PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND 3586 mysql 20 0 2214816 185496 5264 S 5.3 2.3 215:08.15 mysqld 21720 root 20 0 1041144 34868 12484 S 5.3 0.4 52:56.29 python 5142 apache 20 0 934056 102364 13044 S 3.0 1.3 20:12.34 httpd 4377 apache 20 0 929252 97368 12160 S 2.7 1.2 18:49.02 httpd 8639 apache 20 0 943 512 116024 13136 S 2.3 1.4 3:23.69 httpd 2317 root 20 0 258364 17140 10308 S 1.7 0.2 20:23.95 rsyslogd 4437 apache 20 0 922668 89720 11900 S 1.7 1.1 15:32.12 httpd 6023 apache 20 0 934856 99056 12236 S 1.7 1.2 12:01. 60 httpd 22822 root 20 0 101784 5856 4408 R 1.0 0.1 0:00.04 subl 4722 apache 20 0 931528 102776 17380 S 1.0 1.3 10:23.67 httpd 7438 apache 20 0 931652 102396 12264 S 1.0 1.3 5:01.18 httpd ``` In this example output, the load average is 4.21 and the first number indicates the past minute average of Load, the second number indicates the average load in the past five minutes, and the third number indicates the average load in the past 15 minutes. Since this number is higher than twice the number of CPU cores (the server has two CPU cores), it can be inferred that the CPU load is high. Specifically, the CPU usage of mysqld and python is relatively high, which may be one of the reasons for the increased CPU load. In the %Cpu(s) line, you can see the detailed information of the current CPU usage, including user mode (us), system mode (sy), idle (id) and other states. In this example output, the CPU is idle most of the time (89.3% of ids). In the task list (Tasks), you can see all running or waiting processes. Processes are sorted by CPU usage from high to low. Through this list, you can find which processes take up a lot of CPU resources, and then adjust and optimize them.
