### Vue.js version
2.0.0-rc.4
### Reproduction Link
https://jsbin.com/rifuxuxuxa/1/edit?js,console,output
### Steps to reproduce
  1. After hitting 'Run with JS', click the 'click here' button
  2. Wait till `this.show` is `true`(8 seconds), click the 'click here' button again
### What is Expected?
In step 1, prints '2333'  
In step 2, prints '2333'
### What is actually happening?
In step 1, prints '2333'  
In step 2, an error occurs 'o.fn is not a function'
This can only be reproduced when there is a `v-show` element around. I have
tried to put the `v-show` element (in this case, the 'balabalabala' span)
before the `slot`, after the `slot`, outside the `div`, and they all report
the same error after `this.show` is set to `true`.  
This may have something to do with this.
