Abstract. Fueled by a plethora of applications and Internet services,
mobile data consumption is on the rise. Over the years, mobile operators
deployed webproxies to optimize HTTP content delivery. Webproxies also
produce HTTP-logs which are a fundamental data source to understand
network/services performance and user behavior. The recent surge of
HTTPS is progressively reducing such wealth of information, to the point
that it is unclear whether HTTP-logs are still representative of the overall
traﬃc. Unfortunately, HTTPS monitoring is challenging and adds some
extra cost which refrains operators from “turning on the switch”. In this
work, we study the “gap” between HTTP and HTTPS both quantifying
their intrinsic traﬃc characteristics, and investigating the usability of the
information that can be logged from their transactions. We leverage a 24-
hours dataset collected from a webproxy operated by a European mobile
carrier with more than 10M subscribers. Our quantiﬁcation of this gap
suggests that its importance is strictly related to the target analysis.
1 Introduction
Mobile operators are facing an explosion of demand for data access services.
Recent estimates forecast an eight-fold increase of demand between 2015 and
2020, a rate three times higher than for ﬁxed access networks [15]. This explosion
is driven both by the constant evolution of the mobile apps and Internet services
ecosystem, and the roll out of 4G technologies.
In this dynamic and demanding scenario, traﬃc monitoring is paramount.
Accurate understanding of both user behavior and service quality are key to drive
network investments. To study data services, mobile operators rely on Usage
Data Records (UDRs) and HTTP-logs. UDRs aggregate users data activity over
periods of time lasting from minutes up to multiple hours. They are collected
for billing purposes and do not detail the apps/services used [8,9].
Diﬀerently from UDRs, HTTP-logs contain detailed information on individ-
ual HTTP transactions. They are usually collected by webproxies, middle-boxes
that aim at optimizing HTTP delivery through in-network caching and con-
tent modiﬁcation (e.g., image resolution reduction) [4,13]. HTTP-logs have been
extensively used both by operators and academia to characterize mobile network
traﬃc [2,3,6,11,12,16].

With the rise of HTTPS, this scenario is however rapidly changing.
For instance, between June 2015 and June 2016,1 Google reported a +13%
increase of requests served over HTTPS. Sandvine also reports that more than
60% of mobile traﬃc worldwide is currently encrypted [10]. While this calls for
instrumenting webproxies to also log HTTPS transactions, it is unclear whether
the additional cost is justiﬁed. In fact, HTTPS exposes little information about
the service and content users access. In addition, network performance indexes
(e.g., throughput and latency) can only be computed on the whole TLS connec-
tion and not on individual transactions, as commonly done for HTTP.
In this work we present the ﬁrst comparative study between HTTP and
HTTPS traﬃc for mobile networks. Our goal is to quantify the “gap” between
HTTP and HTTPS both in term of their macroscopic qualities and of their
accuracy when singularly used to perform common analysis such as data con-
sumption, user mobility, etc. The input of our study is a unique dataset spanning
HTTP and HTTPS traﬃc, radio-layer information, and device information from
a 10M-subscriber European mobile operator.
Our quantiﬁcation of this gap suggests that its importance is strictly related to
the target analysis. When focusing on volume, neither HTTP nor HTTPS alone are
enough to characterize users activity. This is because of a combination of factors
including type of device and usage pattern across time. Conversely, both traﬃc
types are capable to capture human-driven behaviors like user mobility, which in
turn drives analysis like traﬃc consumption in space and cell towers utilization.
2 Background
This section overviews the classic mobile network architecture while emphasiz-
ing the role of webproxies in it (Fig. 1). The Radio Access Network (RAN),
commonly called “last mile”, is composed of thousands of elements such as cell

sectors, towers, and radio controllers. The Core Network (CN) bridges the RAN
with the Internet by mean of packet data gateways (GGSN and PGW) which
allow mobile users to access data services. The Mobility Management Entity
(MME) servers handle network events related to handovers, paging, and access
control to radio channels, each carrying the device id and the sector from which
the event was triggered. The MME is the control plane of a mobile network.
Figure 1 also shows an acceleration webproxy; this is a transparent (or explicit)
HTTP proxy that operators deploy to speed up content delivery at the RAN while
reducing traﬃc volume at the CN. Common webproxy services are: (i) content
caching, (ii) content compression (e.g., reducing image size/resolution or video
format re-encoding), and (iii) dynamic traﬃc policies enforcement (e.g., band-
width throttling for users that reach their monthly data cap, protection from mal-
ware and third party tracking services). Webproxies log each HTTP transaction
into HTTP-logs, but some vendors provide monitoring solutions that also log the
remaining TCP activity [10]. We call such “extended” logs web-logs .
3 Dataset
We consider web-logs collected for 24 consecutive hours (April 27th, 2016) by the
acceleration webproxy of a major European mobile operator serving more than
10M subscribers. The considered webproxy usually logs HTTP traﬃc only, but
it can be sporadically instrumented to report on other TCP traﬃc like HTTPS.
We call transaction an entry in the web-logs. Each transaction contains at
least the following ﬁelds: IPs/ports tuple (source and destination), timestamp,
duration, user-id, and bytes delivered. Additional ﬁelds can be provided based
on the transaction type. Speciﬁcally, an “HTTP transaction” corresponds to an
HTTP request/response exchange for which the webproxy further logs HTTP
meta-data such as hostname, URL, user-agent, and content-type. User privacy
is guaranteed by hashing sensible information like user-id, requested URL, etc.
For the remainder of the traﬃc, a transaction corresponds to a TCP connection.
If the ClientHello message from a TLS handshake is detected, the webproxy
also logs the Service Name Identiﬁcation (SNI), when provided.
We combine the webproxy dataset with two additional data sources.
Radio-layers enrichment: We process MME network events (see Sect. 2) to
create mobility radio-layers, i.e., per user timelines detailing to which sectors
each user’s device connects to over time. It follows that given the tuple (user-id,
timestamp, duration) of a web-log transaction we can identify the list of sectors
the transaction relates to. This enables us to investigate how content is consumed
by users while moving across the network (see Sect. 5) at a ﬁner granularity with
respect to the literature [12,16].
TAC enrichment: The Type Allocation Code (TAC) database is an internal
resource of the considered operator, and it is based on the GSMA TAC database,2

i.e., the standardized allocation of TAC among vendors.3 The TAC database is
a static table mapping vendor and device model to a user-id. This mapping is
more robust than the classic approach based on HTTP user-agent string, and it
works also in presence of HTTPS.
3.1 Dataset Curation
Following the logic described in Fig. 2, we split web-log transactions into three
classes: HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP-oth (i.e., the TCP traﬃc that is neither
HTTP nor HTTPS). Since the webproxy does not explicitly label web-log entries
originated by TLS traﬃc, we identify HTTPS based on the destination port
(443). The webproxy logs the HTTP METHOD for each HTTP transaction which
eases the identiﬁcation of HTTP traﬃc. In presence of a CONNECT, i.e., for clients
explicitly connecting through a proxy, we still use the destination port to distin-
guish between HTTP and HTTPS.
The middle of Fig. 2 reports the percentage of users, bytes, and transac-
tions of each classiﬁcation tree leaf, while aggregated statistics are reported at
the bottom. Overall, HTTPS dominates the volume of bytes (66.3%) but we
also ﬁnd a non negligible 2.5% of TCP-oth volume. When we focus on transac-
tions, we notice that they are equally distributed between HTTPS (48.7%) and
HTTP (46.5%), which is counter-intuitive due to the bytes diﬀerence observed
above. This is due to the presence of persistent connections that go undetected
in HTTPS. We further analyze this issue in the following.
Content consumed in mobile networks
the
average object size is in the order of tens of kB [5,16]. To reduce the TCP
handshake overhead, HTTP 1.1 introduced the concept of persistent connec-
tions which allow devices to use a single TCP connection to send multiple
requests. Such technique is common to both HTTP and HTTPS, but it is a

hassle only when monitoring HTTPS. In fact, encryption does not allow to iden-
tify request/response pairs over the same TLS connection, resulting in a coarser
view over HTTPS traﬃc if compared to HTTP.
To visualize the impact of the latter limitation, Fig. 3 (left) shows the Cumu-
lative Distribution Function (CDF) of the transaction duration for HTTP,
HTTPS, and TCP-oth. If on the one hand the three traﬃc classes are sub-
ject to diﬀerent dynamics due to how diﬀerent services use them, on the other
hand such huge diﬀerences hint to the presence of persistent connections.
We further corroborate on this by counting the percentage of TCP connec-
tions having more than one HTTP transaction for each user. Figure 3 (right)
shows the CDF of the fraction of persistent HTTP connections during one peek
hour (results hold for diﬀerent hours). The ﬁgure shows that the usage of persis-
tent connections is indeed extremely common and proportional to user activity,
e.g., 90% of the very active users (trans > 1,000 in the plot) have more than 65%
of their HTTP connections being persistent.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has quantiﬁed the adoption of
persistent connections in the wild. Our results indicate that their high popularity
can introduce substantial errors when comparing HTTP with HTTPS traﬃc.
Accordingly, to enable a meaningful comparison among the considered traﬃc
classes, we have opted for pre-processing HTTP traﬃc to aggregate diﬀerent
transactions belonging to the same individual TCP connections.
4 Overall Volumes
We start our analysis with a top-down characterization of how traﬃc volume
(bytes) is split between traﬃc types.
Daily aggregate breakdown: Figure 4 (left) shows the CDF of the percentage
of HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP-oth volume, per user. As expected, HTTPS is the
dominant traﬃc type: 50% of users have more than 77.6% of their volume carried

over encrypted connections. The ﬁgure also shows that TCP-oth volume is far
from being negligible: 5.6% of users have more than 70% of TCP-oth traﬃc.
We further dig into the TCP-oth traﬃc using the destination port to classify
the speciﬁc service being used. We ﬁnd that 84% of volume is associated to
email (e.g., 995/IMAP-SSL, 993/POP3-SSL, 110/POP3) and push notiﬁcation
services (5223 for Apple, 5228 for Android). We also ﬁnd a few thousands users
with “suspicious” behaviors: they contact 227 k IP addresses using 49 k ports
(in a peak hour) and do not transfer any data on the opened TCP connection. For
these 227 k IP addresses, we further retrieve the Autonomous System Number
(ASN) using Team Cymru4 and its classiﬁcation using PeeringDB5 and CAIDA
AS ranking [1]. Such analysis reveals that 97% of these IPs belong to ﬁxed and
mobile ISPs, and are not linked to classic services. We conjecture the presence of
malware, of which we also ﬁnd evidences,6 or some form of P2P communication.
We further divide users into ten groups based on the deciles of the distribution
of their volume consumption. For each group we then extract the 25th, 50th, and
75th percentiles of the share of HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP-oth. Figure 4 (right)
reports the results (the x-axis details the used deciles). Beside noticing that
HTTPS dominates indistinctly within each bin, we observe that TCP-oth shares
are inversely proportional to the overall volume consumed, while the opposite
is true for HTTP. Results reported in Fig. 4 hold also when considering the
number of transactions (we avoid reporting them for brevity). Those diﬀerences
are possibly due to the combination of apps/services used, but to the best of our
knowledge, there are not robust techniques available to classify mobile traﬃc.
Hence we leave a detailed characterization for the future.
