User:  How to use ELK Stack to monitor system logs?
Assistant: 1. Install and configure ELK Stack: including components such as Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. 2. Configure Logstash: Use Logstash to process and collect log data. You can specify the input file through the input plug-in or collect data from various sources through Beats, filter the log messages through the filter plug-in, and finally use the output plug-in to send the data to Elasticsearch. 3. Configure Elasticsearch: process and store filtered log data. Indexes and fields can be defined in Elasticsearch for searching, filtering and visualization in Kibana. 4. Configure Kibana: display the log data already stored in Elasticsearch. You can use charts, dashboards, and visualization tools in Kibana to monitor and analyze system logs. 5. Use Beats: Use Beats to collect data from servers, network devices, and applications, and send the data to Logstash or Elasticsearch. Use Filebeat to monitor file logs in real time, Metricbeat to monitor system indicators, Packetbeat to monitor network traffic, etc. In a word, ELK Stack can help users track, analyze, monitor the status and performance of software and systems, diagnose problems, and find and solve potential failures and errors in time.
