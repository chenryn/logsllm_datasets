A lot of files are really just .xml files, but end in different extensions.
This is just one example
It would be nice if  
A) If on AutoDetect, check the the first line if it contains  then
parse as xml language  
B) Associate an extension with a particular language
Someone might have already created a package for it, but haven't found one
yet.
Thanks!
