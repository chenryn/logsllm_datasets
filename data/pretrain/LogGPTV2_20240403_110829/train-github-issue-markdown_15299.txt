Currently, the result of `deno lint`is output to _stderr_ as follows
     $ deno lint --unstable 1>/dev/null
    (no-explicit-any) `any` type is not allowed
    let a: any = 1;

ESLint, on the other hand, outputs a result to _stdout_. You can see
    $ npx eslint tmp.ts 2>/dev/null
    /home/yusuktan/Repos/github.com/magurotuna/deno/tmp.ts

      1 error and 0 warnings potentially fixable with the `--fix` option.
I think ESLint's way is preferable and `deno lint` also should output its
result to stdout.
Is there any specific reason outputting to stderr, which I haven't noticed?
