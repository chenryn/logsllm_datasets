Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Log Entry:
- Timestamp: 1131566461
- Date: 2005-11-09
- User: dn228
- Month: November

- Host: dn228
- Component: crond (pam_unix)
- Process ID (PID): 2915
- Message: Session opened for user root by (uid=0)
```

This format clearly separates each piece of information, making it easier to read and understand.
