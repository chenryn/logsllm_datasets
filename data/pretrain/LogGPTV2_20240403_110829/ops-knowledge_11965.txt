User: I've got a Python library I am trying to debug (pyzeroconf). The following code returns '34' as if the data was sent down the socket but I can't see those packets on 2 different wireshark equipped PCs.
bytes_sent = self.socket.sendto(out.packet(), 0, (addr, port))
I am at the point where I need to understand what's going on down the call stack.  Is there a way to trace what's happening?
Resolution: the problem was related to the "bind address" the library was figuring out as default.  A value of "0.0.0.0" isn't allowed and fails (at least on Linux) silently.
Assistant: I'm quite sure this not what you expect, but can help:
strace -f -F python myscript.py
strace dump the system calls of a generic program.
