VIA’s relaying heuristic with accurate ground truth. For sim-
plicity, we omit the direct path as an option.

The results are shown in Figure 18, where each curve
shows the CDF of “sub-optimality” of VIA’s performance
on each call, deﬁned by PerfVIA−Perforacle
. We found that VIA’s
relaying decision is within 20% of an oracle’s performance
for 70% of the calls. Note that this is despite picking the best
relay (i.e., sub-optimality of 0) for no more than 30% of the
calls. When there are multiple relaying options with similar
performance, temporal ﬂuctuations may lead to not always
picking the best option. But VIA usually picks the option
that is close in performance to the best.

Overlay routing: Overlay networking has been explored
in a variety of contexts, such as virtual private networks
(VPNs) and multicast [21, 31, 10]. Of interest to us here
is work focused on overlay routing with a view to improving
performance [33, 8]. This work showed that performance in
terms of network metrics such as delay and packet loss, and
also reliability, could be improved by using an overlay path
that traverses well-chosen waypoints.
Despite this promise, overlay routing for performance gains
has not seen much adoption in practice, for several reasons
including the last-mile performance bottlenecks encountered
in using client nodes as peers and the policy issues involved
in turning stub networks (e.g., university campus networks)
into de facto transit networks. Perhaps most importantly,
these efforts involved building up overlay networks from
scratch, both in terms of physical infrastructure and network
probing, which limited their scale.
Our work revisits the idea of overlay routing in the context
of (a) global-scale managed networks, so the global infras-
tructure already exists and need not be built up from scratch,
and (b) a large-scale interactive real-time service, Skype,
which provides both a compelling need for improving per-
formance and (passive) measurements to obviate the need
for active network probing.
Evolution of AV conferencing services: The architecture
of audio-video conferencing services has been evolving, with
a trend towards leveraging cloud resources. A case in point
is Skype, which started off with a peer-to-peer approach to
NAT and ﬁrewall traversal, with some well-connected clients
with public IP addresses serving as super-nodes [27]. How-
ever, in the recent years, Skype has moved to a hybrid model [37],

It has been
reported that Google Hangouts uses relays in the cloud for
all calls, and moreover also has streams traverse the cloud
backbone from one relay to another [37].
Our work is in line with these trends, but focused on per-
formance rather than NAT/ﬁrewall traversal. Also, since
we focus on managed networks, being selective in which
streams are routed via the cloud is crucial in our context.
CDN server selection: Optimal server selection is a much-
studied problem, especially in the context of content distri-
bution networks [35, 34]. The main considerations in the se-
lection process are typically proximity of the client to repli-
cas and the load on the replicas. The main distinction of our
work is our focus on client-to-client communication, which
means that relay selection needs to focus on end-to-end per-
formance rather than just between the cloud edges and the
client.
Internet performance prediction: There is a large body of
work on Internet performance prediction [22, 29, 28], with
a focus on metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and packet loss
rate. The general approach is to probe the network selec-
tively, at chosen times and along chosen paths, and then to
use the measurements to either embed the network nodes in
a coordinate space [18] or estimate the performance of net-
work segments using network tomography techniques [12].
Since we have access to network metrics for a large volume
of calls, our work focuses on leveraging this data rather than
performing active measurements.
Measurement studies: Over the years, there have been a
number of measurement studies of large Internet services,
including web sites [30], CDNs [32], and video-on-demand
streaming [16, 19]. There have also been studies of audio-
video conferencing by working outside the system, say by
running active measurements to Skype super-nodes [36] or
snifﬁng trafﬁc in modest-size deployments [37]. To our knowl-
edge, this work is the ﬁrst study of a commercial VoIP ser-
vice at scale by directly working with end-to-end perfor-
mance metrics recorded by the communicating peers them-
selves.
Estimating VoIP Quality: Several models have been pro-
posed and studied for estimating VoIP quality, typically the
Mean Opinion Score (MOS), based on network performance
metrics [17, 15, 36, 13, 14]. These models vary in the par-
ticular network metrics and codecs they consider. In Sec-
tion 2.2, we used the model proposed in [17], which is based
on the E-Model deﬁned by the ITU [1].
7 Discussion
Cost of centralized control in VIA. Our pilot deployment
and client modiﬁcations suggest a feasible path to a large-
scale deployment from a software update and engineering
perspective. One potential concern, however, is the scala-
bility and responsiveness of the control platform. On the
one hand, VIA introduces minimal per call overhead, since
the client-controller communication need only consist of one
measurement update and one control message exchange per
call and can be further reduced if the clients cache the best
relaying options. On the other hand, handling a large num-
ber of call connections at one logical controller presents a
scalability challenge, though partitioning techniques provide
a good starting point. Also, we conjecture that approaches
similar to the split-control architecture employed in C3 [24]
might offer a scalable realization, since the measurement and
control exchange of the C3 controller (which directs clients
to video CDNs) is similar to the measurement and control
needed for a large-scale VOIP relay server.
Hybrid reactive decentralized approaches. A natural al-
ternative to relay selection is to simply have clients try a list
of relay options sequentially or in parallel, and pick the best
option. Such an approach may be good enough for long-
lived calls. This would avoid the overhead of data collection
and generating the network map. However, as we discussed
earlier, this may not be feasible given the large search space
of relaying options. An interesting hybrid approach is using
the prediction-guided exploration observations as a means to
prioritize or prune this approach. We intend to explore this
approach going forward.
Active Measurements. While our current solution relied
entirely on passive measurements from client calls, there
is an opportunity to augment it with active measurements
(by making mock calls between users or from users to re-
lays), especially since the client software can be readily con-
trolled to make them. Active measurements can be intelli-
gently orchestrated to ﬁll “holes” in the passively obtained
measurements, thereby making our prediction-guided explo-
ration (both its aspects—tomography as well as bandit solu-
tion) more effective. Doing so will require considering the
additional load imposed on the clients due to the collection.
8 Conclusion
By some estimates, the call volume of Internet telephony
surpasses that of traditional telephony. Given its importance,
we take the ﬁrst step towards quantifying the impact of net-
work performance on call quality using traces from Skype,
one of the largest VoIP services. Our sampled dataset con-
sists of 430 million calls over seven months. To mitigate
calls with poor quality, we revisit the classical overlay net-
work techniques but using the managed networks of large
cloud providers. Calls between users with poor network con-
ditions can be selectively relayed via the managed network.
Such managed overlays do not suffer from the drawbacks of
traditional overlays.
To leverage such a managed overlay infrastructure, we
present the design of VIA, a system that carefully selects a
subset of calls to be relayed using the managed overlay. VIA
uses a guided exploration procedure using predicted perfor-
mance derived from end-to-end measurements collected by
the clients, while dealing with variances in real-world esti-
mates and keeping the volume of relayed calls within a bud-
get. Data-driven evaluation shows that VIA improves call
quality by 45% which closely matches the potential beneﬁts
indicated by an oracle.
