We have a library of components for angular that we are currently migrating to
Angular 2. We have a container that injects content using `ng-content`. We
would like to have a child component that injects the parent if you nest it
inside of the parent, like so:
This works beautifully in angular 2. However, since are in the process of
migration, we would like to use the ngUpgrade adapter for this. The dependency
injection seems to fail if the parent and child are specified in an angular 1
context. Any insights on this issue? Is this something that is going to be
supported in the ngUpgrade adapter?
I have a working plunker that illustrates the problem:

In both cases, the template includes a parent with the child
`transcluded/projected` into it. The child tries to inject the parent and then
calls a function on it when you press the button. The ng2 example works, but
not the ng1/ngUpgrade version.
