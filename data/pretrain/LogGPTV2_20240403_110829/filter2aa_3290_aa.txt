## Abstract
Media over Coax Alliance (MoCA) is a protocol specification designed to ensure high-bandwidth connections for voice, video, and high-speed data—collectively known as the "triple play." Service providers such as Verizon, Cox, and Comcast have adopted MoCA as the de facto networking technology for in-home broadband services. This paper reviews MoCA and its common implementations, assessing the vulnerabilities presented by the protocol and its usage.

## 1. Introduction
MoCA is a MAC/PHY specification that enables the use of Ethernet and video protocols over coaxial wiring, which is common in most homes [1]. Supported by an alliance of industry partners, MoCA also facilitates the connection of "last mile" network distribution topologies to the home via fiber-optic (FIOS), cable, or satellite delivery methods. MoCA protocols allow devices with on-board support, such as DVRs and Media Center computers, to connect to the in-home network provided by a cable-modem router, such as an ActionTec wireless coaxial router [2]. The router serves as an uplink, bridging the incoming MoCA Wide Area Network (WAN) signal from the satellite dish, optical network terminator (ONT), or cable distribution node with the in-home MoCA Local Area Network (LAN) signals [3]. This enables the router to support the "triple play" concept: video, voice, and data provision directly from the provider over Ethernet, wireless, and MoCA networking services within the home [4].

## 2. Operation

### 2.1 MoCA in the Home
MoCA acts as a direct bridging technology, converting Ethernet (802.3) data, video, and satellite signals to assigned channels over the coaxial cabling [5]. The physical layer (PHY) utilizes a 50MHz-wide, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signaled channel, with seven defined between 875MHz and 1550MHz [6]. These channels support large packets (>1500 bytes) and use a Reed-Solomon forward error correction algorithm to ensure packet integrity [7]. The availability of bandwidth and error correction features allows for reliable signaling between nodes, even across multiple line splitters, which may introduce reflective interference to the signal transmission.

Atop the PHY, the media access control layer (MAC) provides a distributed mesh architecture via time-division multiple access (TDMA), managed by a fully-scheduled access scheme. This allows up to eight nodes to reliably address one another within the coaxial bus without the need for collision negotiation. Channel and transmission negotiation are handled by an automatically selected Node Controller (NC). Reliability is assured by the selection of a backup node controller that intervenes if the primary NC experiences a delay. MAC polling from the NC every ten milliseconds ensures node registration on the network, channel availability, and priority of the transmission frames, allowing the implementation of Parameterized Quality of Service (pQoS) features [6][8].

Provision at speeds of at least 60 Mbps is critical for the reliable delivery of voice and video services, especially for high-definition entertainment, which requires low latency [6]. The minimum transmission rate of the network can be guaranteed at certain rates depending on the available bandwidth of the PHY. Table 1 shows how PHY bandwidth affects minimum MAC transmission rates, indicating how a provider may use MoCA packet scheduling to calculate the delivery and prioritization of services.

| **PHY Rate (Mbps)** | **Minimum MAC Rate (Mbps)** |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| ≥275                | 139.87                       |
| 250                 | 130.78                       |
| 225                 | 119.45                       |
| 200                 | 107.74                       |
| 175                 | 95.64                        |
| 150                 | 81.98                        |
| 125                 | 68.32                        |
| 100                 | 54.65                        |
| 75                  | 39.82                        |

As indicated, a standard 100 Mbps Ethernet interface could be provided a minimum of 54.65 Mbps of service over the MoCA network. The Ethernet frames are encapsulated by the MoCA MAC frame transmissions using the Ethernet Convergence Layer (ECL) [6]. Nodes on the MoCA network must have an 802.3 ECL device (a.k.a. network bridge) either on-board (e.g., ActionTec router, DVR, ONT) or through an interfacing device, such as a MoCA Coaxial-to-RJ45 bridge. Because MoCA encapsulates the Ethernet frame from one end of the MoCA network to the other, the bridge is invisible to the connected Ethernet device.

The MoCA specification further details categories of devices, which may be provided by the Operational Service Provider (OSP) or a third-party vendor (non-OSP). Table 2 defines the categories and common device types.

| **MoCA Category** | **Function** | **Provided by** | **Example Device** |
|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Terminal          | Sources or sinks content | OSP | ONT |
| Intermediate      | Bridges user content between MoCA network and standard interfacing device (Ethernet/USB) | OSP, Non-OSP | ActionTec router, DVR, MoCA-to-Ethernet Bridge |

Since MoCA is designed to patch physically separated Ethernet-capable devices together, it passes all Ethernet frames over its network to other devices. This includes all Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model layers at the encapsulated link layer and above [8, pp. 52-53]. Thus, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and other higher-level application services are all moved transparently by the MoCA network, as if they were one Ethernet domain. Table 3 illustrates this relationship.

| **OSI Layer** | **Origin** | **MoCA** | **Terminus** |
|---------------|------------|----------|--------------|
| 1             | Fiber, RJ-45 jack, ISM Radio, USB device | Coaxial Cable | Fiber, RJ-45 jack, ISM Radio, USB device |
| 2             | Ethernet frame, Wi-Fi frame, ARP | MoCA node | Ethernet frame, Wi-Fi frame, ARP |
| 3-6           | IP datagram, TCP/UDP packet | Router, Firewall |  |
| 7             | HTTP, DNS, DHCP, SMTP, Skype, SIP, Video streaming | Application proxy, DNS Cache, Application server, Cloud services |  |

MoCA specifies a feature called Link Privacy, which is a link-layer encryption feature based on 56-bit DES and rotating traffic keys [9]. For this feature to work, the privacy passcode must be preconfigured before each node can register with the MoCA network.

### 2.2 MoCA for the OSP
In addition to providing Ethernet bridging to user-facing intermediate devices, providers utilize their provided routers to establish two MoCA root nodes as the base for two MoCA networks. The two roots are virtual devices bound to a single physical adapter and coaxial cable. One MoCA network and its set of related channels provide connectivity between nodes providing local services to the user, configured as the MoCA LAN.

The OSP typically configures a second MoCA network via the second MoCA root node and its related channels, different from the first set, to communicate directly with the ONT. The ONT converts the MoCA signal back to Ethernet and forwards the frame as light back to the OSP [3]. Due to the fragility of optical cabling, flexing a fiber optic cable through a hole in the domicile’s exterior wall is not a desired deployment method. Therefore, the ONT is located close to the point where the fiber optic cable comes out of its underground encasement, attached to the outside of the home in a weather-proof box [10][11]. A more robust coaxial cable is then run from the ONT to the home splitter. The main splitter is typically located on the home’s exterior, as the OSP installs the home’s coaxial cabling during the first installation of services to the domicile. Locating the connections and splitter at the exterior utility point of presence reduces maintenance efforts for the OSP.

This second MoCA network carries the backhaul traffic between the router and the OSP, thus is called the MoCA WAN. Since this network provides only the uplink between two nodes—the router and the ONT—it can eliminate polling overhead and optimize MAC speed conditions to provide a higher bandwidth guarantee for the uplink.

## 3. Security Assessment
To assess the security of the MoCA protocol, aspects of design, deployment, and accessibility were considered. Previous work on securing Verizon’s deployed architectures was consulted, and equipment was procured to access the MoCA layer for testing [13][14]. The ActionTec MI424WR router used for testing supports many interfaces, including wireless, Ethernet, and MoCA.

A comparison was done on these communication form factors to scope the assessment.

### 3.1 Scope

#### 3.1.1 Wireless
Verizon deploys its ActionTec routers with a random 8-character SSID. While the pseudo-random alphanumeric pattern is easy to recognize, it is also deployed with WPA-2 Personal (PSK) enabled. This does not preclude access via a wireless compromise but significantly raises the level of investment for the attacker over prior WEP-only deployments used with earlier versions of the router. With many other resources available that address compromising wireless cryptographic implementations, this avenue was not pursued for this study [15].

#### 3.1.2 Ethernet
Originally released in 1987, the commonly used 10- and 100-Base-T Ethernet protocols have had many resources devoted to penetrating, manipulating, and modifying them [16]. As a wired medium with a connectivity range of 100 meters and typically not wired outside the home, an attacker would need to get physical access to the network within the home. While not able to be attacked directly without these accesses, the MoCA layer, as a bridging protocol for Ethernet, presents situations that enable this class of attack.

#### 3.1.3 Fiber
The fiber optic cabling from the ONT attached to the home runs underground to the local neighborhood optic hub. Without special equipment, accessing the data flowing over the cabling would be impossible. The fiber cable itself is also quite fragile, so manipulating it could break the line, leaving evidence of mishandling. Having neither the equipment nor the desire to damage the setup, accessing the optical cable was not considered for this assessment.

#### 3.1.4 MoCA
OSPs typically install the domicile’s coaxial cabling during the first contracting for service. To ease installation and later maintenance, these RC6-grade coaxial cables are run up to 500 feet from their termination point, typically the MoCA router or a DVR, through the household walls or attic to the exterior provider point-of-presence [17]. The cables are then hubbed with a high-frequency (>1GHz) splitter to the ONT. Coaxial cabling provides better shielding against both electromagnetic noise and the elements than standard CAT5e Ethernet cabling and connectors, which can only run to 100 feet [18]. This increases the range and reliability of the connection, reducing maintenance calls for the provider.

In the past couple of years, more vendors have released products to market to take advantage of the guaranteed bandwidth and easy availability of in-home MoCA networks. To attach standard Ethernet-based devices, like many current Blu-Ray players and Media Center devices, to the MoCA network, ActionTec, NetGear, and other vendors now produce MoCA-to-Ethernet bridge units. With these units mass-produced and easily available through services like Amazon, access to the MoCA network has become a trivial undertaking. This access method was selected for study.

### 3.2 Situation
MoCA, as commonly deployed, provides an easy and accessible means to breach network barriers. The division between internal (LAN) and external (WAN) MoCA networks occurs within the stateful packet inspection (SPI) firewall within the ActionTec router. However, with both networks running over the same physical coaxial network and hubbed outside the home, both sides of the connection become available to an attacker who only has access to the home’s exterior. This removes the constraints of physical access to the network. With commonly available components, an attacker can access and attack the in-home LAN with access only to the exterior of the home.

Even with access to both LAN and WAN networks, there is a frequency difference between the LAN and WAN channels that the attacker must determine to access one or the other. Additionally, most OSPs enable MoCA’s data link protection feature for the MoCA WAN network between the router and the ONT, making attacking that portion of the traffic more difficult. However, an attacker still has options available on the MoCA LAN. To enable easy compatibility, most MoCA LAN implementations do not utilize link privacy. This allows third-party devices to be easily introduced to the MoCA LAN with little or no additional configuration required of the user, providing an easily accessible, unencrypted target for the attacker to begin their reconnaissance.

### 3.3 Components
To conduct the testing, several components were necessary to enable access to the MoCA LAN network. Table 4 describes the items required and whether they were purchased or provided by the OSP.
