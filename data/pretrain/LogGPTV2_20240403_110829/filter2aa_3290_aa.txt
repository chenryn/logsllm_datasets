Abstract— Media over Coax Alliance (MoCA) is a protocol 
specification to enable assured high-bandwidth connections for 
the high demands of voice, video, and high-speed data 
connections – the  ‘triple  play.’  Verizon,  Cox,  Comcast,  and  many  
other service providers have adopted MoCA as the de facto 
networking technology used to provide in-home broadband 
services. 
This 
paper 
reviews 
MoCA 
and 
its 
common 
implementations, assessing vulnerabilities that are presented by 
the protocol and its use. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
MoCA is a MAC/PHY specification that allows the use of 
Ethernet and video protocols over coaxial wiring common to 
most domiciles[1]. Supported by an alliance of industry 
partners, it   also   enables   the   connection   of   the   “last   mile”  
network distribution topologies to the home via FIOS (fiber-
optic), cable, or satellite delivery methods. MoCA protocols 
enable devices with on-board protocol support, such as DVRs 
and Media Center computers, to connect to the in-home 
network provided by the cable-modem router, e.g. an 
ActionTec wireless coaxial router [2]. The router serves as an 
uplink to bridge the incoming MoCA Wide Area Network 
(WAN) signal from the satellite dish, optical network 
terminator (ONT) or cable distribution node with the in-home 
MoCA LAN signals [3]. This enables the router to support the 
concept   of   ‘triple   play’:   video,   voice,   and   data provision 
directly from the provider over Ethernet, wireless, and MoCA 
networking services within the home [4]. 
II. OPERATION 
A. MoCA in the Home 
MoCA acts as a direct bridging technology, converting 
Ethernet (802.3) data, video and satellite signals to assigned 
channels over the coaxial cabling [5]. The physical layer 
(PHY) utilizes a 50MHz-wide, orthogonal frequency division 
multiplex (OFDM) signalled channel, seven of which are 
defined between bands 875MHz and 1550 MHz [6]. The 
channels support large packets (>1500 bytes) and use a Reed-
Solomon forward error correction algorithm to ensure packet 
integrity [7]. The availability of bandwidth and error 
correction features allow for reliable signalling between nodes, 
even across multiple line splitters which may introduce 
reflective interference to the signal transmission. 
Atop the PHY, the media access control layer (MAC) 
provides a distributed mesh architecture via time division 
multiple access (TDMA), managed by a fully-scheduled 
access scheme. This allows up to eight nodes to reliably 
address one another within the coaxial bus without the need 
for 
collision 
negotiation. 
Channel 
and 
transmission 
negotiation is handled by an automatically selected Node 
Controller (NC). Reliability for the network is assured by the 
selection of a backup node controller that intervenes in the 
event of a delay from the primary NC. MAC polling from the 
NC every ten milliseconds ensures node registration on the 
network, channel availability, and priority of the transmission 
frames upon the entire coaxial network, allowing the 
implementation of Parameterized Quality of Service (pQoS) 
features [6][8].  
Provision at speeds of at least 60 Mbps is critical for the 
reliable delivery of voice and video services for the high-
demand, 
low 
latency 
requirements 
of 
high-definition 
entertainment [6]. Via the polling scheme used, the minimum 
transmission rate of the network can be guaranteed at certain 
rates depending upon the available bandwidth of the PHY. 
The following table describes how PHY bandwidth affects 
minimum MAC transmission rates. This indicates how a 
provider may use MoCA packet scheduling to calculate the 
delivery and prioritization of services.

As indicated above, a standard 100 Mbps Ethernet interface 
could be provided a minimum of 54.65 Mbps of service over 
the MoCA network. The Ethernet frames are encapsulated by 
the MoCA MAC frame transmissions using the a process 
defined in the MoCA specification as the Ethernet 
Convergence Layer (ECL) [6]. Nodes on  the MoCA network 
must have an 802.3 ECL device (a.k.a. network bridge) either 
on-board (e.g. ActionTec router, DVR, ONT) or through an 
interfacing device, such as a MoCA Coaxial-to-RJ45 bridge. 
Because MoCA encapsulates the Ethernet frame from one end 
of the MoCA network to the other, the bridge is invisible to 
the connected Ethernet device. 
The MoCA specification further details categories of 
devices. The devices may be provided by the Operational 
Service Provider (OSP) or a third party vendor (non-OSP). 
The table below defines the categories and common device 
types.

As MoCA is designed to patch physically separated 
Ethernet-capable devices together, it passes all Ethernet 
frames over its network to other devices. This includes all 
Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model layers at the 
encapsulated link layer and above [8, pp. 52-53].  Thus, 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain 
Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
and other higher-level application services are all moved 
transparently by the MoCA network, as if they were one 
Ethernet domain.

MoCA specifies a feature called Link Privacy. It is a link 
layer encryption feature based on 56-bit DES and rotating 
traffic keys [9]. For the feature to work, the privacy passcode 
must be preconfigured before each node can register with the 
MoCA network.  
B. MoCA for the OSP 
In addition to providing Ethernet bridging to user-facing 
intermediate devices, providers utilize their provided routers 
to establish two MoCA root nodes as the base for two MoCA 
networks. The two roots are virtual devices that are bound to a 
single physical adapter and coaxial cable. As indicated in the 
previous section, one MoCA network and its set of related 
channels provides connectivity between nodes providing the 
local services to the user. This is configured as the MoCA 
Local Area Network (LAN).  
The OSP typically configures a second MoCA network via 
the second MoCA root node and its related channels, different 
than the first set, to talk directly with the ONT. The ONT 
converts the MoCA signal back to Ethernet and forwards the 
frame as light back to the OSP [3]. Due to the fragility of 
optical cabling, flexing a fiber optic cable through a hole in 
the   domicile’s   exterior   wall   is   not   a   desired   deployment  
method.  Locating the ONT close to the point where the fiber 
optic cable comes out of its underground encasement is 
preferable. Thus the ONT is attached to the outside of the 
home in a weather-proof box [10][11]. A more robust coaxial 
cable is then run from the ONT to the home splitter. The main 
splitter  is  also  typically  located  on  the  home’s  exterior  as the 
OSP installs the   home’s   coaxial   cabling   during the first 
installation of services to the domicile. Locating the 
connections and splitter at the exterior utility point of presence 
reduces maintenance efforts for the OSP.

Terminator [12] 
This second MoCA network carries the backhaul traffic 
between the router and the OSP, thus is called the MoCA 
Wide Area Network (WAN). Since this network provides only 
the uplink between two nodes – the router and the ONT – it 
can eliminate polling overhead and optimize MAC speed 
conditions to provide a higher bandwidth guarantee for the 
uplink.  
III. SECURITY ASSESSMENT 
To assess the security of the MoCA protocol, aspects of 
design, deployment, and accessibility were considered. 
Previous work on the topic of securing Verizon’s   deployed  
architectures were consulted and equipment was procured to 
access the MoCA layer for testing [13][14]. The ActionTec 
MI424WR router used for testing supports many interfaces, 
including wireless, Ethernet, and MoCA.  
Figure 2: ActionTec MI424WR router connections 
A comparison was done on these communications form 
factors to scope the assessment. 
A. Scope 
1)  Wireless 
Verizon deploys its ActionTec routers with a random 8-
character SSID. While the pseudo-random alphanumeric 
pattern is easy to recognize, it is also deployed with WPA-2 
Personal (PSK) enabled. This does not preclude access via a 
wireless compromise, but significantly raises the level of 
investment for the attacker over prior WEP-only deployments 
used with earlier versions of the router. With many other 
resources available that address compromising wireless 
cryptographic implementations, this avenue was not pursued 
for this study [15]. 
2)  Ethernet 
Originally released in 1987, the commonly used 10- and 
100-Base-T Ethernet protocols have had many resources 
devoted to penetrating, manipulating, and modifying them 
[16]. As a wired medium with a connectivity range of 100 
meters and typically not wired outside the home, an attacker 
would need to get physical access to the network within the 
home. While not able to be attacked directly without these 
accesses, the MoCA layer, as a bridging protocol for Ethernet, 
presents situations that enable this class of attack. 
3)  Fiber 
The fiber optic cabling from the ONT attached to the home 
runs underground to the local neighborhood optic hub. 
Without special equipment, accessing the data flowing over 
the cabling would be impossible. The fiber cable itself is also 
quite fragile, so manipulating it could break the line, leaving 
evidence of mishandling. Having neither the equipment or 
desire to damage the setup, accessing the optical cable was not 
considered for this assessment.  
4)  MoCA 
OSPs typically  install  the  domicile’s  coaxial  cabling  on  the  
first contracting for service. To ease installation and later 
maintenance, these RC6-grade coaxial cables are run up to 
500 feet from their termination point, typically the MoCA 
router or a DVR, through the household walls or attic to the 
exterior provider point-of-presence [17]. The cables are then 
hubbed with a high-frequency (>1GHz) splitter to the ONT. 
Coaxial cabling provides better shielding against both 
electromagnetic noise and the elements than standard CAT5e 
Ethernet cabling and connectors, which can only run to 100 
feet [18]. This increases the range and reliability of the 
connection, reducing maintenance calls for the provider. 
In the past couple of years, more venders have released 
products to market to take advantage of the guaranteed 
bandwidth and easy availability of in-home MoCA networks. 
To attach standard Ethernet-based devices, like many current 
Blu-Ray players and Media Center devices, to the MoCA 
network, ActionTec, NetGear and other vendors now produce 
MoCA-to-Ethernet bridge units. With these units mass 
produced and easily available through services like Amazon, 
access to the MoCA network has become a trivial undertaking. 
This access method was selected for study.  
B. Situation 
MoCA, as commonly deployed, provides an easy and 
accessible means to breach network barriers. The division 
between internal (LAN) and external (WAN) MoCA networks 
occurs within the stateful packet inspection (SPI) firewall 
within the ActionTec router. However, with both networks 
running over the same physical coaxial network and hubbed 
outside the home, both sides of the connection become 
available   to   an   attacker   that   only   has   access   to   the   home’s  
exterior. This removes the constraints of physical access to the 
network. With commonly available components, an attacker 
can access and attack the in-home LAN with access only to 
the exterior of the home. 
Even with access to both LAN and WAN networks, there is 
a frequency difference between the LAN and WAN channels 
that the attacker must determine to access one or the other. 
Also,  most  OSPs  enable  MoCA’s  data  link  protection  feature  
for the MoCA WAN network between the router and the ONT. 
This makes attacking that portion of the traffic more difficult.  
However, an attacker still has options available to them on 
the MoCA LAN. To enable easy compatibility, most MoCA 
LAN implementations do not utilize link privacy. This allows 
third party devices to be easily introduced to the MoCA LAN 
with little or no additional configuration required of the user. 
This provides an easily accessible, unencrypted target for the 
attacker to begin their reconnaissance. 
C. Components 
To commit the testing, several components were necessary 
to enable access to the MoCA LAN network. The following 
table describes the items required and whether they were
