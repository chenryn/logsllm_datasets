### TI Value Perceptions

| Aspect | Respondents (n=14) |
|--------|--------------------|
| Actionability | 100% |
| Providing context | 50% |
| Timeliness | 50% |
| Comprehensiveness | 36% |
| Suitable abstraction level | 21% |
| Interpretability | 14% |
| Visualized well | 64% |
| Relevance | 50% |
| Sectoral focus | 50% |
| Geographic focus | 14% |
| Coverage of relevant threats | 79% |
| Ability to correct bias | 71% |
| Confidence | 50% |
| Automatability | 43% |
| Confidence in vendor | 29% |
| Original contribution | 21% |
| Accuracy | 14% |
| Selectiveness | 6% |
| Affordability | 14% |

**Table 6:** We identify actionability, relevance, and confidence as three key aspects of the value of a TI source. All respondents agree that TI should provide context.

### Interview Protocol

Our interviews were conducted using the following questions:
- What does 'cybersecurity threat intelligence' mean to you?
- Which threat intelligence sources does your organization pay for?
- Which non-commercial sources are important for your organization? Are these as important as the paid sources?
- Did you ever discontinue a source?
- For each paid TI source, discuss:
  - What are the costs of this source to your organization?
  - What does this source consist of? How do you receive it?
  - How is this source used in your organization? Which systems or processes rely on it?
  - Which results of the use of this source are most valuable? How often does this occur? What are the strengths and weaknesses of this source?

### Codebook

The codebook consists of four tables. Tables 3 & 4 in Section 5, and the two tables below that reflect Section 7.

### Use Cases of TI

| Use Case | Respondents (n=14) |
|----------|--------------------|
| Network detection | 93% |
| Situational awareness | 64% |
| SOC prioritization | 50% |
| Informing business decisions | 36% |
| Enrichment of more intel | 36% |
| Improving end user awareness | 29% |
| Threat hunting | 29% |
| Informing security engineering | 21% |
| Reducing financial fraud | 14% |

**Table 5:** Network detection is the most prominent use case of TI, though more than half of respondents also describe situational awareness and SOC prioritization.
