recognized as a superior security strategy. Until that happens
for commercial threat intelligence, the problem of information
sharing persists.

Table 6: We identify actionability, relevance, and conﬁdence
as three aspects of value of a TI source. All respondents share
the view that TI should provide context.
A INTERVIEW PROTOCOL
We conducted our interviews along the following questions:
– What does ‘cybersecurity threat intelligence’ mean to you?
– Which threat intelligence sources does your organization
pay for?
– Which non-commercial sources are important for your or-
ganization? Are these as important as the paid sources?
– Did you ever discontinue a source?
– For each paid TI source, discuss:
– What are the costs of this source to your organization?
– What does this source consist of? How do you receive
it?
– How is this source used in your organization? Which
systems or processes rely on it?
– Which results of the use of this source are most valu-
able? How often does this occur? What are strengths
and weaknesses of this source?
B CODEBOOK
The codebook is composed of four tables. Tables 3 & 4 in
Section 5, and the two tables below that reﬂect Section 7.
USE CASES OF TI
Network detection
Situational awareness
SOC prioritization
Informing business decisions
Enrichment of more intel
Improving end user awareness
Threat hunting
Informing security engineering
Reducing ﬁnancial fraud

Table 5: Network detection is the most prominent use case
of TI, though more than half of respondents also describe
situational awareness and SOC prioritization.
