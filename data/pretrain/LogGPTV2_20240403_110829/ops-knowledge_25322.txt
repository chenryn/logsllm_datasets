### Original Issue and Resolution

I previously had Google App Engine (GAE) 1.4 installed on my local Ubuntu system, and everything was functioning correctly. The only warning I received at that time was: "You are using the old GAE SDK 1.4."

To address this, I took the following steps:

1. **Uninstalled the old GAE 1.4 version**.
2. **Installed GAE 1.7**.
3. **Updated the `djangoappengine` folder** to the latest version.
4. **Copied the new GAE 1.7 to the `/usr/local` directory**, as my `~/.bashrc` file's PATH variable points to this directory.

After these changes, I encountered the following error:
```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: 'djangoappengine.db' isn't an available database backend.
Try using django.db.backends.XXX, where XXX is one of:
'dummy', 'mysql', 'oracle', 'postgresql', 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'sqlite3'
Error was: No module named utils
```

I did not believe there was an issue with the directory structure, as it had been working fine before.

### Solution

The problem was resolved by ensuring that the changes made to the `~/.bashrc` file were properly applied. Specifically, after updating the GAE path in the `~/.bashrc` file, I **restarted the system**. This step was crucial because the changes in the `~/.bashrc` file were not being recognized until the system was restarted.

Thank you for your help.
