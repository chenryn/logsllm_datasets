User: I had GAE 1.4 installed in my local UBUNTU system and everything was working fine. Only warning I was getting at that time was something like "You are using old GAE SDK 1.4." So, to get rid of that I have done following things:

I removed old version of GAE and installed GAE 1.7. Along with that I have
also changed my djangoappengine folder with latest version.
I have copied new version of GAE to /usr/local directory since my ~/bashrc file PATH variable pointing to GAE to this directory.

Now, I am getting error
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: 'djangoappengine.db' isn't an available database backend.
    Try using django.db.backends.XXX, where XXX is one of:
    'dummy', 'mysql', 'oracle', 'postgresql', 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'sqlite3'
Error was: No module named utils
I don't think there is any problem of directory structure since earlier it was running fine.
Does anyone has any idea ? 
Your help will be highly appreciated.

Assistant: Actually I changed the google app engine path in /.bashrc file and restarted the system. It solved the issue. I think since I was not restarting the system after .bashrc changes, hence it was creating problem.
