User: Is there any IDE that allows to run a script in testing mode, allowing to replace at runtime, some values, like a folder or else?
I have a program that will have to run on a network i have no access to where I develop. Since it will use some specific folders to pick up files, I was wondering if i.e. I could use an IDE that using some parameters will translate all that is like \corporate\disk-c\myfolder into a c:\myfolder.
Thanks!

Assistant: In absence of some other file based config, you could just keep the variable definitions in a a file that you import in the main script (e.g, config.py), then have two different versions of that file for 'on' and 'off' network, (or ' development' and 'production', whatever) with the appropriate settings.  No IDE needed.
