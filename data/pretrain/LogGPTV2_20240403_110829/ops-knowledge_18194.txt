When using `appcfg.py`, I had to explicitly specify the backends to update them. However, when using Push-to-Deploy, I'm unsure if the same process applies.

I noticed that two of my versions have different "deployed" dates; specifically, the backend still shows a deployment date of "6 days ago." I did not modify the `backends.yaml` file, but I did make changes to the code running on that backend.

Should I see a new "deployed" date for the backend? Is Git Push-to-Deploy working as expected?

**Response:**
No, Git Push-to-Deploy does not automatically update the backends. This was evident when my cron jobs failed last night because they were still running the old code. It seems that the traditional method using `appcfg.py update ./ --backends` is still necessary for updating backends.
