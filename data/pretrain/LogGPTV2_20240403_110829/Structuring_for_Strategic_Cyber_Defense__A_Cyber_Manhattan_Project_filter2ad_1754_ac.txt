### Budget Items
To clarify, we are not suggesting the reprogramming of all cyber-related budgets from existing agencies. Programs necessary for carrying out mission-specific tasks within these agencies should continue under their current processes. New funding associated with achieving the objectives of the national initiative should be entirely under the purview of the National Cyber SPO (Special Program Office). This office can delegate some responsibilities to other agencies as executive agents, while retaining and executing other programs directly.

### The Right Leadership—Best of the Best
The head of the National Cyber SPO would undoubtedly be a political appointee, working directly for the president as a special assistant. However, this individual must be the best in the country—a generic manager will not suffice. This visionary leader must earn the trust of the scientists and engineers within the organization through their competence and leadership. Additionally, they must be trusted by both industry and academia, as they will play a crucial role in the solution. The president should select this person with great care, seeking sound advice from close advisors and experts in the cyber domain who know the shortlist of candidates with the requisite skills and credentials.

### The Right Size
The organization should remain lean and agile, with a staff of around 200 people, modeled after DARPA. The SPO should be granted immediate authority to hire directly from industry. If the SPO selects 20 of the country's top professionals, they can then attract the rest. Utilize Scientific and Engineering Technical Assistance (SETA) support extensively to amplify the capabilities of the team, similar to DARPA. Grant individuals complete authority over their programs and trust them to align with the stated vision. The National Cyber SPO director should be personally involved in each hiring decision.

### The Right Mission
The mission statement for the SPO should be simple and clear. A potential mission could be to "avoid strategic damage to the United States from cyberspace" or, more positively, "make the United States the world's leading superpower in cybersecurity." Alternatively, it could be framed less militaristically as "lead the world in cyberspace safety and security for the benefit of mankind."

### A Way Forward
Designate a government leader to head a small transition team of top talent, as discussed above. Set a three-month deadline for the team to develop a "blueprint" to launch the project, including technical and program management aspects. The team will be responsible for developing a detailed technical plan and an effective organizational structure, with an overarching architecture and roadmap being essential.

### Strategic Moves
Using a chess analogy, the following "opening strategic moves" are critical for immediate action, considering the broader context and global dynamics in cyberspace:

1. **Use Architecture Principles**: Embrace architectural principles that enable the creation and operation of secure systems. Organize networks and systems to "operate through attacks," allowing for fallback operations and rapid recovery, even from unanticipated attacks. Favor stratified/partitioned designs for critical security components. Reorganize networks that have deviated from these principles, separating critical data and functions of the control plane from the operational plane. Develop special-purpose security devices in critical areas to provide high-assurance protection functionality.

2. **Value and Prioritize**: Design systems to satisfy critical mission requirements. Value and prioritize critical cyber infrastructure functions. As functions are automated and integrated, calculate the cost of operating without the function (e.g., its vulnerability to cyber attack) to assess its mission-criticality. Quantify recovery and rollback.

3. **Validate**: Create and combine metrics-driven security analysis, simulations, and testing. Develop test environments to vet theories of defense, cyber offense, new mechanisms, and operators using the best cyber strategy and tactics. Different test environments with various scales will be needed, and some may need to be domain-specific. Numerous testbeds are under development but must be significantly improved for usability and to provide data and tools to support experiments.

4. **Create Trust and Justify Trust**: Use authentication and attestation mechanisms to establish trust, especially in new environments where mobility is the norm. Trustworthy identity combined with privacy-protecting mechanisms is a prerequisite for security policy enforcement and mechanisms such as network admission control.

5. **Develop Human Capital**: Inaugurate national competitions in secure system engineering to attract new talent and integrate academic, industry, and government efforts. Create research institutes with unclassified and classified government research funding processes to encourage long-term, focused engagement in crucial areas. Increase funding in areas that will create a cyber workforce of researchers, system developers, and system administrators for commercial and government-critical systems.

6. **Robust Research**: Initiate research in key technology areas, such as:
   - Practical techniques and tools for the secure composition of large-scale architectures to support safe system design, extension, and evaluation.
   - Transparent security mechanisms that enable rather than interfere with work.
   - Active automated forensics to identify attackers and account for their actions.
   - Self-healing and dynamic security to raise the bar for attackers.
   - System security benchmarking and assessment to develop quantifiable metrics.

7. **Preparatory Deep Analysis**: Validate and extend the strategic analysis that has begun in various forums, such as the NCDI workshop series and the Dark Angel analysis done by the PCD. Establish mappings between initial moves and ultimate goals, identify and fill gaps, and set metrics to reach agreed-upon goals. Explore models for positively influencing markets to reengineer the cyber terrain to the defender's benefit, engaging economists and industry leadership.

### Conclusions

#### Focus on Strategic Cyberspace
There is a broad range of threats to almost every system in cyberspace, from individual home computers to critical national infrastructure. By focusing on grave threats that could cause strategic damage to the nation, we can form a cohesive and effective program.

#### Stakes Are High
Inaction is not an option. Based on the vetted Dark Angel scenarios, compromising national security is a real possibility if we make a misstep today. Those entrusted with providing for the common defense and protecting the future must act.

#### Reengineering Cyberspace
Unlike physical territory, cyberspace is engineered and manufactured, presenting both a serious problem and a great opportunity. Economic incentives in existing markets have driven cyberspace to be highly functional but poorly assured from a national strategic perspective. The government cannot solve this problem alone, so top talent from industry must work hand-in-hand with the government to reengineer the markets and make cyberspace inherently safer from strategic threats.

#### Strategic Uncertainty Is Unacceptable
Some argue that the threat is overblown, but recent events in cyberspace, such as attacks in Estonia and Georgia and China's apparent espionage activities, confirm the strategic concern. Immediate and high-priority validation of the gravity and source of the strategic risk to our information infrastructure is essential. Engage the best of the best in this analysis to ensure any significant program created to address the threat remains focused and effective.

The nation and the world stand on the cusp of an information age whose infrastructure is a vast, new, untamed territory with much promise but also significant perils. It is past time to begin the process of bringing these perils under control.
