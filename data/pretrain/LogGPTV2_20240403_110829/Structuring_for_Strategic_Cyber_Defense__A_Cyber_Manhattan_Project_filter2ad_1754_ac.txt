budget  items.  To  be  clear,  we  aren’t  talking  about 
reprogramming all cyber-related budgets from existing 
agencies. Existing programs required to prosecute the 
mission-specific  portions  of  those  agencies  should 
continue  with  existing  processes.  New  monies 
associated with achieving the objectives of the national 
initiative  should  be  completely  under  the  purview  of 
the  National  Cyber  SPO—delegated,  in  part  to  other 
agencies as executive agents, and retained in part and 
executed as programs in the National Cyber SPO. 
5.6. The Right Leadership—Best of Best 
Although  the  head  of  the  National  Cyber  SPO 
would  certainly  be  a  political  appointee  who  works 
directly  for  the  president  as  a  special  assistant,  this 
person  would  have  to  be  the  best  of  the  best  in  the 
country—a  generic  manager  simply  won’t  do.  This 
visionary  must  be  trusted  by  the  scientists  and 
engineers  working  in  the  organization  for  his/her 
competence  and  leadership.  This  person  must  also be 
trusted by industry and academia alike because he/she 
will be an essential part of the solution. The president 
should  pick  this  person  with  great  care  and  sound 
advice and counsel from his closest advisors and from 
experts in the cyber realm who know the short list of 
people with the requisite skills and credentials. 
5.7. The Right Size 
The  organization  should  be  kept  lean  and  agile—
200 people are about right (using DARPA as a model). 
Authority  for  hiring  directly  from  industry  should  be 
conferred onto the SPO immediately. If it chooses 20 
of  the  country’s  best,  then  those  people  can  seek  out 
and  attract  the  rest.  Use  Scientific  and  Engineering 
Technical  Assistance  (SETA)  support  liberally  to 
amplify  the  capabilities  of  the  cadre  in  the  way  that 
DARPA  does.  Give  individuals  complete  authority 
over their programs and trust them to do the right thing 
toward the stated vision. Hire carefully—the National 
Cyber  SPO  director  should  be  personally  involved  in 
each hire. 
5.8. The Right Mission 
The  mission  statement  for  this  SPO  should  be 
simple and clear. As a strawman, it could be to “avoid 
strategic  damage  to  the  United  States  from  Cyber 
space” or more positively, “make the United States the 
world’s 
less

6. A Way Forward 
Designate a government leader of a small transition 
team  of  top  talent  as  discussed  above.  Give  a  three-
month hard deadline for the team of experts to develop 
a “blueprint” to launch the project, including technical 
and program management aspects. The team would be 
responsible for working out the technical plan and the 
details  of  effective  organization 
structure.  An 
overarching architecture and roadmap is a must. 
Some  important  “moves”  that  the  blueprint  team 
would  need  to  keep  in  mind  include  the  following. 
Using  a  chess  analogy,  we  can  call  these  “opening 
strategic  moves”  to  indicate  the  need  for  immediate 
action  and  to  acknowledge  the  broader  context  and 
dynamics  of  what  the  rest  of  the  world  is  doing  in 
cyber space. A move is a strategic action to mitigate a 
strategic risk in cyber defense and contributes toward a 
higher-level goal such as a capability or end-state. The 
following are quoted from the NCDI Opening Moves

7. Conclusions 
Focus on Strategic Cyber Space. There is a broad 
range of threats to almost every single system in cyber 
space,  from  individual  home  computers  to  business 
enterprise systems to the most critical systems that are 
the  heart  of  civilization  (power,  telecommunications, 
and  banking,  to  name  the  top  three).  All  of  these 
threats  need  mitigation  to  one  degree  or  another. 
Talking about the full range of threats to the full range 
of systems is overwhelming and diffusing. By focusing 
on  those  grave  threats  that  could  cause  strategic 
damage  to  the  nation  (and  the  world),  we  have  the 
possibility  of  forming  a  cohesive  and  effective 
program.

Stakes  Are  High.  But  what  if  we  don’t  do 
anything?  Based  on  the  vetted  Dark  Angel  scenarios, 
we could compromise national security as we know it 
if we make a misstep today. Inaction isn’t an option for 
any  of  us  who  now  know  these  stakes  and  are

defense and protect the future.

commons  prevents  the  market,  on  its  own,  from 
addressing  this  large  risk.  At  the  same  time,  the 
government  can’t  solve  this  problem  on  its  own 
because the engineering and manufacture of the fabric 
of  cyber  space  can’t  and  shouldn’t  be  taken  over  by 
government.  Top  talent  from  industry  must  therefore 
work hand-in-hand with the government to reengineer

have  argued  that  the  threat  stated  in  this  paper  is 
overblown. However, the author believes that the case 
made  here  is  compelling,  and  that  recent  events  in 
cyber space such as attacks in Estonia and Georgia and 
China’s  apparent  espionage  activities  tend  to  confirm 
the  strategic  concern.  Nonetheless,  such  arguments

The  nation  and  the  world  stand  on  the  cusp  of  an

that process.
