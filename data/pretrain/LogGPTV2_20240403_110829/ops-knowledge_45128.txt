Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the template extraction:

**Log Line:**
```
Connection request from old client /10.10.34.33:39730; will be dropped if server is in r-o mode
```

**Template:**
```
Connection request from old client /<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>; will be dropped if server is in r-o mode
```

In this template:
- `<IP_ADDRESS>` represents the IP address (e.g., `10.10.34.33`).
- `<PORT>` represents the port number (e.g., `39730`).

This format makes it clear what each part of the log line represents, enhancing readability and understanding.
