I have just tried to update an installed extension, but the process seemed to
hang.
I eventually decided to restart VS Code, and when I did, the extension in
question was no longer installed. I attempted to install it again, but the
process never seemed to complete. I did this a few times, each time
opening/closing VS Code, and eventually, on I think the fourth attempt, the
extension correctly installed.
Is this a known issue? Are there any logs that I can provide to help identify
the problem?
