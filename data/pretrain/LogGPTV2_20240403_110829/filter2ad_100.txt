ABSTRACT
Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are used in a variety of domains
such as critical infrastructure, smart factory, transportation, etc.
Since dependable CPSs tend to be configured for specific tasks that
are performed repeatedly, security threats to CPSs have started
increasing. To enhance CPS security, it is necessary to realistically
reproduce and test scenarios that reflect the characteristics of the
target system. Prior to developing technologies for CPS security,
individual experimental environments are necessary to evaluate
the developed technologies. In this paper, we propose a Controller-
in-the-Middle (CitM) scheme that provides a flexible experimental
environment for CPS security, which consists of an independent
process exchanged between field devices and a complex process
combining different independent processes. Using the proposed
scheme, various scenarios and test environment can be reproduced
flexibly.

1 MOTIVATION
Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are composed of field devices such
as sensors, actuators, and control devices. CPSs have been deployed
widely and are operational in critical infrastructure, smart factories,
and smart cities. CPSs are exposed to various security threats as the

system becomes more complicated due to the scalability and open-
ness of the interconnected heterogeneous components in a network.
In the CPS environment, since the field devices are handled directly
by the control device, if a cyber attack occurs, serious damage
such as physical destruction of the device or secondary explosions
may be caused. Therefore, security measures and researches are
necessary. In fact, the ICS-CERT under the US Department of Home-
land Security reported 257 ICS-related vulnerabilities in 2016. This
number is expected to grow in the future[5].
In order to overcome these security threats, cyber security tech-
nologies such as intrusion detection and vulnerability analysis,
which monitor the network traffic and operational information
to detect an attack, have been studied. However, it is practically
impossible to verify the performance of the intrusion detection tech-
nology or apply the results of vulnerability analysis to operational
control systems in the real world. Therefore, a test environment
reflecting the CPS operational information and traffic character-
istics is required for the experiments. In addition, it is important
to acquire experimental data that can be used for data-integrated
analyses such as machine learning, to enhance the CPS security by
diversifying the CPS applications and complicating the CPS config-
uration. To overcome these problems, several studies have set up
their own test environment and have generated specific data sets
that meet their research objectives.
In general, test environments are often reduced, simulated, and
emulated in the real world. Therefore, there are limitations in terms
of similarity or fidelity to the actual environment. To add new
control process functions or increase the complexity of the sys-
tem, the test environment needs to be rebuilt, which is expensive
and requires much expertise. These static and specific test envi-
ronments and datasets collected in the environment have both
quantitative and qualitative limitations in the performance eval-
uation and verification of CPS security. For example, in the case
of intrusion detection, it is necessary to test and analyze whether
attack detection is possible by changing the operating situation
and configuration when attacks occur, even if the attacks are of
the same type. However, there are difficulties in manually setting
up and experimenting on a number of cases. It is burdensome to
set up and experiment many different cases manually. In addition,
when reproducing cyber attacks and operating the actual control
device, physically connecting the input and output points according
to the situation takes time and has a high risk of human errors.

model with reflection such as feedback of linkage logic between
control processes, physical sensing of information during opera-
tion, or manipulation by operators so that the environment can be
automatically controlled with flexibility, and is not static or specific.
In this paper, we propose a controller-in-the-Middle (CitM) con-
figuration, which is a systematic and flexible test environment
for control devices and control processes. By using the proposed
method, we can effectively reproduce various control system op-
erations and cyber attack scenarios. We also consider a hot-swap
scheme to manipulate the control and linkage logic and sensor-
based information during operation. We expect our experimental
configuration of CPS to contribute to the generation of quantitative
and qualitative data sets.

2 RELATED WORK
The CPS test environment consists of the cyber environment where
the entity performs the computation and processing for the control,
and the physical environment containing the physical entity such
as a sensor, an actuator, and so on. In order to prepare the test
environment for CPS security research, environments should be
constructed properly, according to the research purpose. As the
CPS test environment has recently become more diverse in terms
of the CPS configuration and application fields, there is a need for
research on integrated data analysis technologies such as machine
learning to enhance security. Accordingly, research is in progress to
actively secure the data set; however, there are limitations arising
from the configuration of the CPS experiment environment.
Morris et al. [4] introduced a CPS testbed in which water treat-
ment and gas pipelining were simulated to obtain data sets for
intrusion detection research. A total of 28 attack scenarios were
constructed, including inject, delay, drop, and alter network traffic
using the bump in the wire method to obtain data sets for each
attack scenarios. However, since these experimental environments
did not consider the linkage between each domain, they operated
independently. Therefore, the complexity of the testbed was lower
than that of the real world.
Secure Water Treatment (SWaT)[1], a CPS test environment in
the water treatment domain, was configured as a physical environ-
ment that reflects the complex operating environment of an actual
site with a pump, sensor, and actuator, similar to a real device, to
implement the control process. SWaT could implement 36 attack
scenarios by defining the device and physical points to be attacked
so as to construct attack scenarios related to field signals and net-
work traffic. However, the attack scenarios collected manipulated
sensor data or packets using only the communication between
the operating device (i.e., SCADA, HMI, Engineering Workstation
(EWS), and Historian) and the control device, a programmable logic
controller (PLC), except for the communication section between
the operating device and field device.
Rodofile et al. [6] configured field devices that could control and
monitor the conveyor, wash tank, and pipeline reactor using the
Siemens PLC. It aimed to acquire the dataset of S7 communica-
tion (S7comm), which is a proprietary protocol that runs between
Siemens PLCs, in the mining refinery. Since the test environment
was implemented only on a threshold-based on/off control process,
the environment was not complicated when compared to the actual
operation of the mining refinery. In addition, the datasets were bi-
ased against the process attacks because the attack scenarios were
confined to process controls as changing the on/off and threshold
of the field device.
Lemay et al. [3] constructed a testbed using real controllers to
obtain Modbus traffic data related to the covert channel command
and control data. It included various network traffic of the testbed
but did not produce operation information of the controllers or field
devices. The diversity of the datasets was ensured by manipulating
the environment settings such as the number of controllers and
polling cycle, or in the manual mode under an operator.
The limitations of the experimental CPS testbeds mentioned
above were inherent in both the structural and operational en-
vironments. Therefore, when the CPS security testbed is set up,
it is necessary to consider minimizing the user intervention in
the configuration process as well as in the operation process after
completing the configuration, and to deal with interoperability in
various domains.
3 CITM: CONTROLLER-IN-THE-MIDDLE
Most industrial control systems are complex process control sys-
tems, and each unit process is connected in serial or parallel to
form the entire process. In order to produce the output of the unit
process continuously, the controller determines the current internal
state from various sensor values and transmits the control signal
to the actuator.
In this paper, a unit process is defined as a process that is pro-
cessed by one embedded controller such as PLC, distributed control
system (DCS), or remote terminal unit (RTU). A complex process
control system consists of one or more unit process control systems
and complex process control systems. In general, a unit process
is a hybrid system which is combine continuous-time dynamics
with discrete events of operation. It can be expressed as a hybrid
automata[2] in which the finite set of control modes is specified
respectively by a state-space equation and connected each other by
triggering of discrete events, much like transitions between control
modes.
As shown in figure 1, CitMs are installed between field devices
and reproduce the I/O signals. In this paper, we refer to the device
installed in the unit process control system as a unit CitM, and
a device connected to the unit CitM are called a complex CitM.
Poster SessionASIACCS’18, June 4–8, 2018, Incheon, Republic of Korea830The unit CitM is used to simulate various attack scenarios by ma-
nipulating the I/O signals of the controllers. To reproduce various
scenarios, the complex CitM diversifies the control modes of the
unit processes and the control mode transitions between the unit
processes. In particular, even if each unit CitM works independently,
a complex process control system can be simulated by connecting
the complex CitM and the unit CitM.
3.1 Unit CitM
A unit CitM is connected in-line between embedded controllers
and field devices (sensors, and actuators) in a unit process control
system. The unit CitM can change the control command values,
sensing values, and the control modes of the unit process according
to the user requirement. Thus, the unit CitM can simulate various
situations such as sensor value forgery attacks and control logic
forgery attacks without changing the control logic of the controller
or manipulating the field devices.
A unit CitM is designed to manipulate the input signal in real
time and produce a new output signal. It consists of a signal ma-
nipulator, signal generator, signal selector, and signal collector. The
signal manipulator outputs elaborately manipulated signals using
the input signals, and the signal generator generates new signals
using the internal or external reference signals. For the fast sig-
nal processing, the signal manipulator and signal generator are
required to minimize internal computation and to use the results
calculated in the complex CitM. The signal selector outputs one sig-
nal from among the original input signal, manipulated signal, and
generated signal, according to the external selection signal from
the complex CitM. Finally, the signal collector links the internal
state information to the outside.
3.2 Complex CitM
A complex CitM can reconfigure the control mode connection be-
tween the sub-process control systems and change the information
exchanged in real time to create various complex processes. Figure 1
shows the CitM configuration in a CPS testbed. The complex CitM
installed in the top-level complex process control system enables
all the CitMs installed in the sub-process control systems to be in-
terlocked and controlled in real time by synchronized interactions.
The control mode transitions between unit processes are accom-
plished by a complex CitM, which manages all the unit CitMs that
are distributed and operated in the unit process. A unit CitM man-
ages all I/O signals that can be linked to other unit processes. To
determines the connections of specific I/O values, a complex CitM
feeds back the current control mode status of all unit CitMs and
then delivers a selection signal to each unit CitM. Unit CitMs make
a connection I/O signals with unit processes according to the oper-
ating scenario(e.g., a normal operation or an abnormal operation).
For a normal operation, the control mode is changed periodically.
On the other hand, an abnormal operation scenarios can be im-
plemented by changing the control mode switching temporarily,
stochastically, and continuously.
4 CONSTRUCTING CPS TESTBED
As shown in figure 2, we are constructing a CPS testbed consisting
of three unit process control systems: boiler, turbine, and water
Figure 2: The architecture of CPS testbed
treatment system. A unit CitM is installed on a unit process control
system. A complex CitM connects and works with all unit process
control systems. The CPS testbed is connected to several IT-based
devices including HMI, EWS, PLC, and Historian server through
the network. To construct a realistic environment, we installed
security equipments, intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion
prevention system (IPS), and firewalls, used in critical infrastructure.
For security experiments, it is necessary to be able to monitor
and collect internal information during operation in real time. We
installed an OLE for process control (OPC) system to monitor and
collect the operation information of all control devices and CitMs.
All network traffic of the testbed is monitored and collected using
network switch mirroring. In addition, we collected event logs of
the security equipments.
5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we proposed the CitM scheme to be able to build the
flexible testbed for CPS security research. In addition, we introduced
what we have completed for constructing the CPS testbed.
Using CitMs, we are developing a systematic method to repro-
duce normal and abnormal operation scenarios based on user re-
quirement. This allows a wide variety of operating scenarios of the
entire control system to be tested without changing the control
logic of the embedded controllers in the testbed. Therefore, we
can simulate various normal and abnormal situations with minimal
manual effort. Finally, we will create datasets containing the various
operation scenarios for CPS security research.
