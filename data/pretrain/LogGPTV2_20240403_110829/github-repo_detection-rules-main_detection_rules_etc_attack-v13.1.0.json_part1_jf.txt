### Network Monitoring for Uncommon SMB Data Flows

#### Overview
Monitor network data for uncommon Server Message Block (SMB) data flows. Processes that typically do not engage in network communication or have never been observed before are considered suspicious.

#### Implementation 1: SMB Write
**Detection Pseudocode:**
```python
smb_write = filter(flow, lambda f: f.dest_port == "445" and f.protocol == "smb.write")
```

**Detection Notes:**
- The logic for this implementation focuses on detecting SMB write requests, which are often used by adversaries to move laterally to another host.
- Unlike SMB reads, SMB writes typically require a higher level of access, resulting in less frequent activity. This narrows the focus to techniques associated with actively changing remote hosts rather than passively reading files.

#### Implementation 2: SMB Copy and Execution
**Detection Pseudocode:**
```python
remote_start = join(smb_write, process_create, 
    lambda smb, proc: smb.hostname == proc.hostname and 
                      smb.file_path == proc.image_path and 
                      smb.time < proc.time)
```

**Detection Notes:**
- This implementation detects new processes created from a file written to an SMB share.
- First, a file is remotely written to a host via an SMB share; then, various execution techniques can be used to run the file or script.
- While SMB file writes and remote execution may occur normally, the combination of these two behaviors is less frequent and more likely to indicate adversarial activity.
- Network analysis frameworks like Zeek can capture, decode, and alert on SMB network flows.

### Monitoring Compressed or Encrypted File Types
Monitor newly constructed files being written with extensions and/or headers associated with compressed or encrypted file types. Detection efforts may focus on follow-on exfiltration activity, where such files can be detected in transit using network intrusion detection or data loss prevention systems analyzing file headers.
