User: I tried several Python IDEs (on Windows platform) but finally I found only Eclipse + PyDev meeting my needs. This set of tools is really comfortable and easy to use. I'm currently working on a quite bigger project. I'd like to have a possibility to use CVS or any other version control system which would be installed on my local harddrive (I recently moved my house and don't have yet an access to internet.)
It doesn't matter for me if it'd be CVS - can also be any other version control system. It'd be great if it will be not too hard to configure with Eclipse. Can anyone give me some possible solution? Any hints?
Regards and thanks in advance for any clues. Please forgive my English ;)

CVS and SVN are the Centralized Version control systems. Rather than having to install them on your local system just for single version control, you could use DVCS like Mercurial or Git.
When you clone a Mercurial Repository, you have literally all versions of all the repo files available locally.
