User: Please describe the common server architecture types, and what scenarios are they suitable for?
Assistant: 1. Single server architecture: All applications and services run on a single server. It is suitable for small companies or start-ups because of its low cost, easy management and maintenance, and no complex architectural challenges. 2. Layered server architecture: Distribute applications and services across multiple servers, with each server running a specific service. This architecture is very suitable for large-scale applications and data processing. 3. Distributed server architecture: run multiple servers in different geographical locations, with high scalability and reliability. Distributed architectures are commonly used in Internet enterprise, social networking, and e-commerce applications. 4. Microservice Architecture: Split the application into smaller microservices by splitting functional modules. Each microservice has its own deployment and upgrade cycle and is able to operate independently. For applications that require rapid iteration, pluggable components, and rapid deployment. 5. Cloud Architecture: Migrate applications and data to the cloud platform, taking advantage of the elasticity and scalability of cloud computing. It is suitable for large-scale data processing, high-throughput business scenarios and companies that need to reduce IT costs as much as possible. In short, choosing the right server architecture depends on the company's size, business needs, and technical needs, and needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
