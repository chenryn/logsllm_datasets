User: I have a wxPython application that is almost done & I would like to place it in my portfolio. I have to consider when someone attempts to run my app that they may not have Python, or wxPython, so if they just click the main script/python file its not going to run, right?
How should I distribute my app (how do you distribute ur apps) so that it can be run & also so that it could be run on the 3 major OS's (Unix, Windows, MacOSX)?
I know of py2exe for releasing under windows, but what can I use for Unix & MacOSX to compile the program? Whats the easiest way?
Assistant: I suggest both, script for all platforms and frozen binary for lazy windows users.
To answer your latest question, you don't compile python. Python is an interpreted language, it gets compiled on the fly when run. A python frozen binary is actually the python interpreter with your script hardcoded in it. And frozen binaries are windows-only, AFAIK. Besides, Unix and MacOS (usually) come with python pre-installed.
