ABSTRACT
In this paper, we conduct the first global-scale measurement study
to unveil how 30 mobile operators manage mobility support in
their carrier networks. Using a novel, device-centric tool, MMLab,
we are able to crawl runtime configurations without the assistance
from operators. Using handoff configurations from 32,000+ cells
and > 18, 700 handoff instances, we uncover how policy-based
handoffs work in practice. We further study how the configuration
parameters affect the handoff performance and user data access.
Our study exhibits three main points regarding handoff con-
figurations. 1) Operators deploy extremely complex and diverse
configurations to control how handoff is performed. 2) The setting
of handoff configuration values affect data performance in a ratio-
nal way. 3) While giving better control granularity over handoff
procedures, such diverse configurations also lead to unexpected
negative compound effects to performance and efficiency. More-
over, our study of mobility support through a device-side approach
gives valuable insights to network operators, mobile users and the
research community.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Internet is going mobile. To date, billions of mobile users are
accessing the Internet as they move. For their Internet access, the
cellular network plays a pivotal role, since it is the only global-scale
infrastructure with ubiquitous mobility support. Central to its mo-
bility management is the handoff scheme [6]. In a nutshell, handoffs
switch mobile device’s serving cell tower (called cell hereafter) from
one to another as the user roams. It is a mechanism that may greatly
affect user experience. For instance, data services are disrupted if
an expected handoff happens too late (e.g., no handoff yet while
the old cell’s radio signal quality is too weak); data throughput
drops when a handoff makes a bad choice (e.g., 2G cell instead of
high-speed 4G cell).
Despite its importance, there is little study on real-world handoff
practices. Current efforts focus on how handoffs affect TCP and
applications [20, 21, 25] and how to improve their performance [16–
18, 26, 29]. Instead, we study how and why handoffs are performed
over operational networks, as well as their implications on data
access. This is the focus of this work.
We have identified three challenges. First, practical handoffs take
the policy-based approach. Each handoff takes into account many
factors, including cell priorities, radio link quality, a list of events of
interest, eligible candidate cells, etc.. It runs multiple asynchronous
procedures (say, measurement, reporting, decision and execution,
Figure 1). Each procedure has its own configuration parameters,
while following the common mechanism (logic) standardized in
the specifications (3GPP [5–9, 12]). For example, a certain measure-
ment is triggered when the serving cell’s radio signal strength rS
is smaller than certain threshold, rS ≤ ΘrS
. Through configuring
distinct values for ΘrS
, operators manage handoffs at each cell and
different locations. Therefore, tunable configurations play an impor-
tant role on policy-based handoffs. Second, no large-scale handoff
traces are publicly available. Given the policy-based practice, oper-
ators are reluctant to reveal their data sets due to privacy concerns.
Moreover, it is nontrivial for the operators to collect and archive
handoff operations, given that handoffs are executed at each cell for
each mobile device in the distributed manner over geo-distributed
areas. Third, handoff configurations take many parameters and are
distributed at all cells for a mobile carrier network. The standard
specifications [6, 7, 9, 10, 12] describe 66 parameters for a single 4G
cell and 91 parameters for 3G/2G RATs (radio access technologies,
see Table 4 for an illustration).
To address the above challenges, we take a device-centric, rather
than infrastructure-centric, approach to measurement study on

Summary
Real-world handoff configurations are ex-
tremely complex and diverse and allow
micro-level mobility management in the
wild.
Q1
Q2
Configurations affect radio signal and per-
formance as expected (by design), but not all
the impacts are intuitively ‘positive’.
Details
1a. Handoffs are policy-based and their configuration space is high-dimensional.
1b. Parameter values exhibit rich diversity (distinct distribution and dispersion). They are
affected by many factors like carriers, frequency, location etc.
1c. Study of handoff configuration diversity helps troubleshooting problematic practice.
1d. Most configurations seem reasonable but not all are well justified.
2a. The serving cell’s radio signal quality in handoffs changes as configured.
2b. Data performance impacts match with expected consequences by reasoning.
2c. Improving radio signal quality is not the sole key to better data performance. In most
cases, timing of handoffs is more crucial.
2d. Current configurations for both active-state and idle-state handoffs are ‘questionable’
in terms of performance and efficiency.

handoffs. We thus design MMLab, a software tool that runs at the
mobile device without operators’ assistance. In a nutshell, MMLab
takes the device-centric approach to crawling handoff configura-
tions from operational networks. It leverages the fact that handoff
configurations are broadcast by the serving cell and reach each
nearby mobile device. It consequently extracts all configuration
parameters from the signaling messages received at the mobile
device, thus enabling real-world handoff configuration collection
via smartphones only.
Using MMLab, we and our volunteers have collected handoff con-
figuration traces and handoff instances1 from global mobile carriers
across three continents. Our data set D1 contains > 18, 700 handoff
instances, while our data set D2 covers handoff configurations from
32,000+ cells over 30 carriers in North America, Europe and Asia.
Based on the traces, we conduct an in-depth study on cellular
mobility support. We examine why and how a handoff is triggered
at a cell (reason and procedure), rather than which cell is eventually
chosen (consequence). We look into persistent and structural factors
that determine a handoff procedure, instead of transient factors
like time-varying radio channel quality and network states. We
provide answers to the following two questions: (Q1) What are
these configurations in the wild? (Q2) What impacts do these policy-
based configurations have on handoff performance? How do they
affect data access for mobile users?
Specifically, we first use dataset D1 to characterize small-scale
handoff configurations (Q1) and empirically assess their perfor-
mance impacts on handoff configurations (Q2). We further use
dataset D2 to conduct a large-scale study and show how they are
configured and explore why. Table 1 summarizes our main find-
ings to be elaborated later. Our measurement study yields many
interesting results which have not been anticipated or reported.
Specifically, handoff configurations may not select the cell with
best radio signals, and they are extremely diverse. Operators use
a few popular choices to decide their policy practice. While some
configurations sound rational, a few others seem to be problematic.
They may degrade handoff quality or cause problematic handoffs;
in many real cases, we observe that timing, rather than better radio
signal quality, is more critical to mobility performance. We discuss
their implications for operators and mobile users, and identify new
research opportunities inspired by our study.

2 POLICY-BASED HANDOFF PRIMER
Cellular networks deploy many overlapping cells across geographic
areas. At a given location, a mobile device is served by one cell but
covered by multiple cells in proximity. The cells may use distinct
RATs of 2G, 3G and 4G. Each cell further operates over a given
frequency channel (see [30] for a complete list of channels).
A handoff switches the serving cell from one to another. Depend-
ing on the used frequencies, handoff can happen over: intra-freq
(on the same RAT and frequency channel), inter-freq (on the same
RAT but different channels), and inter-RAT (on different RATs).
Handoffs are generally classified into two categories: idle-state
handoff and active-state handoff, depending on whether the device
is at the idle/active state without/with user traffic. The idle-state
handoff is performed by the device. It selects an appropriate cell for
future access. The active-state handoff is initiated by the network.
The serving cell migrates the device to another target cell to retain
radio access.
2.1 Handoff Procedures
Figure 1 depicts a basic handoff procedure. It typically consists of
four to five steps: configuration, measurement, reporting (only for
active-state handoff), decision and execution. Initially, the device
is served by cell S; it receives handoff configuration parameters
broadcast by S ( 1 ) and learns the criteria to trigger, decide and
perform a handoff, including whether to invoke measurement, what
and when to measure, whether/when/what to report and how to
determine the next target cell, to name a few. The subsequent steps
( 2 - 4 ) will be invoked when the criteria configured by S’s handoff
parameters are satisfied at runtime.
