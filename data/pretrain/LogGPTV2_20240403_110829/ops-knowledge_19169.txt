User:  Please elaborate how to achieve integration between Gitlab and Jenkins when using Jenkins for CI/CD.
Assistant: Gitlab and Jenkins can be integrated in the following two ways: 1. Using the Gitlab plug-in Jenkins provides a Gitlab plug-in through which Gitlab and Jenkins can be integrated. The specific operation steps are as follows: a. Install the Gitlab plug-in in Jenkins. b. Create a CI/CD Pipeline project in Gitlab. c. When configuring the Jenkins task, select Gitlab as the source code manager, and enter the warehouse URL and Gitlab private token and other information. d. After completing the task configuration, you can see the tasks that have been integrated with Jenkins in the CI/CD Pipeline project in Gitlab. 2. Using Webhooks Gitlab provides the Webhooks function, which can integrate Gitlab and Jenkins through Webhooks. The specific operation steps are as follows: a. Create a Webhook in Jenkins. b. Create a CI/CD Pipeline project in Gitlab and configure Webhooks. c. When configuring Webhooks, copy the Webhook URL created by Jenkins into Gitlab. d. After the configuration is complete, when the code is submitted in Gitlab, Gitlab will send a request to the specified Jenkins Webhook URL, thereby triggering the corresponding Jenkins task. No matter which method is used for integration, through the integration of Gitlab and Jenkins, continuous integration and continuous delivery can be realized, and a complete CI/CD process can be established.
