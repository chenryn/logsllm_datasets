User: I am running python in a non interactive session on windows and therefore I cannot map a network drive.
Most of what I have researched on here and through google everyone suggests mapping a network drive and copying the files that way.
On linux I would facilitate this with an smbmount but unfortunately the software I am working with is tied to windows.
Are there any options for interacting with files via a UNC path?
Assistant: Personally, I've never had difficulties getting Python to simply recognize \\\\<server>\\path\\to\\directory\\. The annoying part is that for every "\" in the win. path, there needs to be 2 in python.
