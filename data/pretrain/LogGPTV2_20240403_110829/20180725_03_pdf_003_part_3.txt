Cluster-wide and local configuration
1. Patroni takes the contents of the /config key from DCS.
2. Most of the parameters can be redefined locally in the patroni.yaml
postgresql: section. It allows to set parameters for this specific instance. One
can use it to configure Patroni and PostgreSQL correctly on nodes that doesn’t
have the same hardware specification.
3. ALTER SYSTEM SET overrides values set on the previous 2 steps. It is not
recommended, since Patroni will not be aware of that changes and, for
example, will not set the pending_restart flag.
Some argument, for instance, max_connections,
max_locks_per_transaction, wal_level, max_wal_senders,
max_prepared_transactions, max_replication_slots,
max_worker_processes cannot be redefined locally.

bootstrap: # is used only one-time, when the cluster is created

Changing the bootstrap section in the Patroni
configuration takes no effect once the cluster
has been bootstrapped.

REST API endpoints
GET /master or GET /
GET /replica
GET /patroni
GET, PUT, PATCH /config
POST /switchover, POST /failover
POST /restart
POST /reinitialize
GET /patroni is used by Patroni during failover in order to
check if the master is running and compare the node’s own
WAL position with the one from other nodes.

Monitoring PostgreSQL health
● PostgreSQL master is running
○ GET /master should return 200 for one and only one node
● PostgreSQL replicas are streaming
○ GET /patroni from the master should return replication: [{state: streaming}
for all replica nodes]
● PostgreSQL is running
○ GET /patroni should return state:running for every node in the cluster
● PostgreSQL replicas is not lagging
○ GET /patroni received and replayed location on every replica should not
be behind a certain threshold from the GET /patroni xlog: location from
the master
Patroni API does not provide a way to discover all PostgreSQL nodes. This can be
achieved by looking directly into the DCS, or using some features of the cloud
provider (i.e. AWS labels, see
https://github.com/zalando/patroni/blob/master/patroni/scripts/aws.py).

Routing connections from clients
● Using API http status codes:
○ /master - {200: master, 503: replica}
○ /replica - {503: master, 200: replica}
● Using callbacks:
○ on_start, on_stop, on_reload, on_restart, on_role_change,
● Using information from DCS (i.e. confd)
● HAProxy example: https://github.com/zalando/patroni/tree/master/extras/confd
○ Can be adopted to Pgbouncer
● Using jdbc:
jdbc:postgresql://node1,node2,node3/postgres?targetServerType=master
● libpq starting from PostgreSQL 10:
postgresql://host1:port2,host2:port2/?target_session_attrs=read-write

Using callbacks
Callbacks are executed asynchronously after successfully
completing the actions that trigger them.
Beware of race conditions.

Using tags to modify behavior of
capital letters
individual nodes
● nofailover (true/false) - disable failover/switchover to the given node
(node will not become a master)
● noloadbalance (true/false) - /replica always returns code 503
● clonefrom (true/false) - node adds itself to the list of origins for
initializing new replicas. When at least one replica has this tag, cloning
will always be performed from that replica if PostgreSQL is running there.
When multiple replicas has it - the cloning origin is chosen randomly
among one of them.
● nosync (true/false) - node will never become a synchronous replica
● replicatefrom (node name) - specify a node to replicate from. This can
be used to implement a cascading replication. If the node is not suitable
(doesn’t exist or not running PostgreSQL), the master will be chosen
instead.
* Tags are configured on every node individually

Using replicatefrom to create cascading

Use tags on the new node to create a cascading
streaming replica.

Switchover and failover

Switchover and failover
● Failover: emergency promotion of a given node
○ automatic, when no leader is present in the cluster
○ manual, when automatic failover is not present or cannot decide on
the new master
● Switchover: switch of the master role to a new node. Requires the
presence of the master.
