Question: "In the context of secure coding practices, what is a potential consequence of including the same header file multiple times in a C/C++ program, as seen in the code below?

#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

Choose the most appropriate consequence."
 "A": "It increases the risk of namespace collisions and makes the program more vulnerable to certain types of attacks."
 "B": "It may cause a compilation error due to the redefinition of functions or macros."
 "C": "It could potentially lead to increased compilation time and unnecessary resource consumption."
 "D": "It significantly enhances the program's security by providing multiple layers of declaration checks."
Answer: C
