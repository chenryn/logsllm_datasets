Keynote I:   Advances in memory state-preserving fault tolerance  
Abstract:  
Memory  state-preserving  fault  tolerance  (MPFT) enables a  running  process to  continue  to 
run without  disruption in  spite  of any  failure  of the  underlying  hardware  machine  or  operating 
system, and is built on the idea of continuous virtual machine migration and epoch-based execution 
model. Although there has been a commercial implementation of MPFT for some time, its real-
world use is not as wide-spread as expected, mainly because its serious performance penalty. In 
this  talk,  I  will  first  go  over  the  main  limitations  of  existing  MPFT  implementations,  and 
then describe an open-source implementation of MPFT that not only supports all basic MPFT 
functionalities, but also removes all of these limitations.

Keynote II: Future of Network and Service Automation: Resiliency Challenges for 
Communicating to the Limit 
Abstract: 
We  are  at  the  dawn  of  an  era  of  profound  human  progress  based  on  digitalization.  Digital 
transformation drives a set of new requirements that have the network at the center, connecting 
everything,  providing  compute  wherever  it  is  needed,  and  applying  insights  to  execute  with 
precision.  To  accomplish  this,  networks  must  be  able  to  connect  everything  simultaneously, 
whenever necessary, with guaranteed reliability and security, even as the number, diversity, social 
and operating condition change. Innovation in automating networks and in creating new network-
as-a-service platforms will be the key element enabling Communication Service Providers (CSPs) 
to finally become the new Digital Service Providers (DSPs) of the future. This talk illustrates the 
key  challenges  and  innovation  needed  for  creating  the  resilient  hyper-connected  automated 
network of the future. 
Speaker: Marina Thottan 
Marina Thottan  joined  Bell  Labs  Research  in  1999,  and  has  contributed  to  a  wide  variety  of  projects, 
including Content Distribution, Routing protocols, Data over Optical networks, High Speed Router Design, 
Network Management, Anomaly Detection and Smart Grid Networks. Most recently she has been leading 
work on End-to-End Network Orchestration, Network Slicing, and 5G Security. She and her team have also 
consulted with both domestic and international utilities on smart grid network transformation as well as 
with Communication Service Providers on their 5G transformation. 
Marina  received  a  Ph.D.  in  Electrical  and  Computer  Engineering  from  Rensselaer  in  2000.  She  has 
published over 50 papers in scientific journals, book chapters and conferences and holds several patents in

Keynote III: Reliable Quantum Computing Needs Intelligent Software and Hardware 
Abstract:  
Quantum computers can solve commercially important problems that are beyond the capability of 
conventional computers. Quantum computing is at an inflection point where small systems with a 
few dozen qubits have been demonstrated and the number of qubits is expected to increase to 
several hundred over the coming years. As qubits are low-energy devices, they are susceptible to 
high  error-rates  (in  the  range  of  0.1%  to  1%  per  operation).  Unfortunately,  quantum  error-
correction incurs a significant overhead (dozens/hundreds of physical qubits per fault tolerant qubit) 
and is impractical for near-term machines. Therefore, hardware errors will continue to severely 
restrict the length of the program that can be reliably executed on a near-term quantum computer. 
In this talk, I will offer a computer-systems perspective of quantum computers and then share some 
of our recent work that improves the reliability of near-term quantum computers with intelligent 
software  techniques.  I  will  also  discuss  the  hardware  support  necessary  to  enable  large-scale 
quantum computers.
