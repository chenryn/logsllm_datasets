User: How to use Linux command line tools to perform disk capacity statistics and analysis?
Assistant: 1. Use the df command to obtain disk usage: The df command can display all mounted file systems and their disk usage, including total capacity, used capacity, available capacity, and mount points. For example, use the following command to view the disk usage of all filesystems: ``` df -h ``` The -h option displays a readable format in units of K/M/G/T. 2. Use the du command to view the size of the directory: The du command is used to view the size of the specified directory and files, including subdirectories and files. For example, use the following command to view the size of all files and directories in the current directory: ``` du -h ``` 3. Use the find command to find large files: The find command can find files and directories based on various criteria, including file size , modification time, file type, etc. For example, use the following command to find files larger than 100MB: ``` find / -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \; ``` This command looks for files of type 100MB in the root directory above files, and execute the ls command to list the file details. 4. Use the ncdu tool to visualize disk usage: ncdu is a very practical command-line tool that can visually display disk usage in the terminal, allowing users to quickly locate large files and folders that take up space. You can use the following command to install ncdu: ``` sudo apt-get install ncdu ``` After the installation is complete, use the following command to enter the ncdu interface: ``` ncdu ``` Then you can use the arrow keys such as up, down, left, and right to operate up.
