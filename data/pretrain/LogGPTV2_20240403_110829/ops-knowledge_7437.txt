Assistant: This log chunk shows the system running tasks in stages 15 and 16. The python.PythonRunner component is tracking the total, boot, init, and finish times for each task. The executor.Executor component is assigning tasks to the executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend and sending results to the driver. The broadcast.TorrentBroadcast component is reading a broadcast variable and the storage.MemoryStore component is storing the broadcast variable in memory.
