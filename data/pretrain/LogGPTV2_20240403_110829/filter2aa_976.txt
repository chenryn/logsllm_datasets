IPv4 Exhaustion
 As of 6-30-2010, 16 "/8 address ranges" remain
 Each /8 has 16.8 Million Addresses
 205 /8s already allocated
 35 Reserved for special uses
From link Defcon-talk 3
The End is Near
The End of the World
 No Reprieve
 IANA will not re-purpose 
class D or E addresses for 
general use
 People who ask for IPv4 
addresses after exhaustion 
will not get them
 Hoarding, scalping, and 
simple direct sale of IPv4 
addresses will begin soon

What Now?

Methods of IPv6 Migration
Ignore IPv6: Stay on IPv4-only
Gateways: Devices that convert IPv6 to 
IPv4
Tunnel IPv6 over IPv4
Dual-Stack: IPv4 and IPv6 together
Nirvana: IPv6-only
IPv6 Tunnels
 Fast and easy to set up--best for n00bs
 Not the best for security or performance
 Free IPv4-to-IPv6 Tunnels

Security Problems
Security Problems
 Used by Ethernet
Privacy Risk
 Anyone who has your IP address also has your 
MAC address!
 There is a "Privacy Extensions" technique to 
avoid this, enabled by default in Vista and 
Windows 7
ICMPv6
 Required for all networks
 Cannot be blocked
 Replaces ARP
 "Neighbor Discovery" is trivial
THC-IPv6
 Hacker's Toolkit
 Runs fine on 
Ubuntu, even in 
VMware on 
Windows 7

Other Risks
 Many security appliances are not ready for IPv6, 
so it often bypasses them
 Torrents run over IPv6
 Link Defcon-talk 9
 Some VPN appliances are not ready, so IPv6 
connections must bypass them
 Packet Amplification Attacks
 Routing Header Zero
 Ping-pong
