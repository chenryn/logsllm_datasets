**A. Proven Bound on Attack Edges**

In their study, the authors demonstrate that as long as the number of attack edges is bounded by \(o(n \log n)\), their approach can effectively distinguish between honest and Sybil nodes [46].

**B. Statistical Properties of Graphs Before and After Preprocessing**

The following table summarizes the statistical properties of the graphs before and after preprocessing. Preprocessing significantly reduces the graph size and alters their structural properties.

**C. Precision and Recall Analysis**

Figure 2 illustrates the precision of SybilLimit when recall is 95% for each social network considered, with \(p = 0.01\). Other SybilLimit-like protocols exhibit similar results.

**D. Fundamental Assumptions and Their Validity**

Two fundamental assumptions underpin the elegant approach to decentralized universal Sybil defense:
1. The cut between the Sybil and honest regions (the set of attack edges) is suitably sparse.
2. The mixing time of the honest region is \(O(\log(n))\).

These assumptions ensure that random walks of \(\Theta(\log n)\) steps will end in a random edge in the honest region with high probability. However, recent literature has cast doubt on these assumptions. Social graphs do not appear to be fast mixing [17], [23], and the probability of fake identities being accepted as friends is higher than anticipated [6], [43]. This implies that the set of attack edges is not as sparse as assumed.

**E. Sensitivity to Sparse Cuts and Mixing Time**

To evaluate the sensitivity of SybilLimit-like protocols to these assumptions, we use SybilLimit [46] as a representative. We rank nodes in decreasing order of trust relative to a given verifier node \(u\). The precision at position \(k\) is defined as the fraction of honest nodes among the top \(k\) ranked nodes, while the recall at position \(k\) is the ratio of honest nodes in the top \(k\) positions to the total number of honest nodes in the network.

SybilLimit-like protocols are designed to operate on preprocessed networks where all nodes with a degree lower than five have been removed [46]. Table III shows the statistical properties of the graphs used in our experiments.

**F. Performance Evaluation**

Figure 3 plots the precision versus recall of SybilLimit for the preprocessed Facebook dataset. SybilLimit is very effective when the number of attack edges is within the theoretical bound (\(p = 0.01\)). However, performance degrades rapidly once this bound is exceeded.

**G. Impact of Preprocessing**

Mohaisen et al. [23] observed that the preprocessing step, which boosts the mixing time of social graphs, also significantly reduces the graph size. In our experiments, the preprocessing step removes over 85% of the nodes. These removed nodes are effectively considered Sybils by the protocol. While they may still enlist other nodes as proxies [45], it is unclear how removed nodes can safely take advantage of honest nodes' resources and vice versa [23].

**H. Discussion and Future Directions**

The goal of universal decentralized Sybil defense with strong theoretical guarantees, driven by early research, relies on assumptions (short mixing time and cut sparseness) whose validity is questionable. Yu [44] suggests two potential ways forward: offering Sybil defense only to well-connected core nodes or renouncing the current framework's elegant theoretical worst-case claims in favor of "weaker but less clean assumptions" [44].

**I. Communities and Sybil Defense**

Theoretical guarantees of existing protocols hold only if honest nodes are closely connected and the cut between honest and Sybil nodes is sparse. Empirical evidence, however, indicates that social graphs consist of communities, each a tightly-knit sub-network [17], [23]. This suggests an alternative goal: providing each honest node \(u\) with the ability to whitelist a trustworthy set of nodes—those in the community to which \(u\) belongs.

**J. Problem Formulation**

**Problem 1.** Let \(u\) be an honest user and \(S\) a subset of the honest region such that:
- \(u \in S\),
- \(S\) has mixing time \(\tau\),
- There are at most \(o\left(\frac{|S|}{\tau}\right)\) edges between \(S\) and the rest of the social graph.

We aim to develop an algorithm capable of almost perfectly distinguishing between the nodes in \(S\) and those outside \(S\).

**K. Community Detection and Sybil Defense**

Viswanath et al. [39] observed that SybilLimit-like protocols separate the social graph into two communities: honest nodes and Sybils. They explored whether off-the-shelf community detection algorithms could be used for Sybil detection. Their findings were mixed: Mislove's algorithm [21] achieved comparable results to SybilLimit-like protocols on synthetic and real-life Facebook graphs, but attackers aware of the community structure can make the Sybil region indistinguishable from a sub-network of honest nodes.

**L. Minimum Conductance Cut**

Conductance, which is hard to tamper with and related to mixing time, is a candidate for defining the problem of Sybil defense. The minimum conductance cut problem, common in community detection, can be formulated as:

**Problem 2.** Find a set \(S\) whose conductance \(\phi(S)\) is as close as possible to \(\phi(G)\), the minimum conductance of the graph.

If the honest region is fast mixing and connected to the Sybil region via a sparse cut, \(S\) should capture the entire honest region. However, this view is too simplistic and can be circumvented by adversaries using fewer attack edges than needed to dupe SybilLimit-like protocols.

**M. Mislove’s Algorithm and Its Limitations**

Mislove’s algorithm [21] finds small conductance cuts by growing a set \(S\) greedily. Starting from a vertex \(u\), the algorithm incorporates the vertex \(v\) connected to \(S\) that results in a set \(S \cup \{v\}\) with minimal conductance. Despite its intuitive appeal, this heuristic fails against simple attacks. For example, creating a Sybil region with nodes \(s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_n\) connected in a specific pattern can result in Mislove’s algorithm admitting every node in the Sybil region [2].

**N. Fast Mixing Communities**

Given the connection between sybil defense and conductance, we explore techniques that leverage the community substructure in social graphs. The key approach involves random walks, which are central to efforts towards universal Sybil defense. The minimum conductance cut problem, while NP-hard, can be approximated using sophisticated algorithms [4], [14], [31]. However, these algorithms are not easily parallelizable and have a running time polynomial in the size of the entire graph. We consider alternative techniques that offer less stringent guarantees but have a time complexity dependent only on the size of the set \(S\).

**O. Conclusion**

Reframing Sybil defense to leverage the community substructure in social graphs requires a deep understanding of the relationship between Sybil defense and conductance. The approach we explore in subsequent sections relies on random walks and aims to provide a more robust and practical solution.
