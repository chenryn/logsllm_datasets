**ATT&CK ID:** T1574  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Hijack Execution Flow

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the normal execution flow of operating systems. This technique can be used to achieve persistence, as the hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Additionally, adversaries may leverage these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade security defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.
