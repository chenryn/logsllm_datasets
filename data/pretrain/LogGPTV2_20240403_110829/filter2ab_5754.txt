**ATT&CK ID:** T1562.010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Downgrade Attack

Adversaries may attempt to downgrade or use outdated versions of system features that are vulnerable and/or do not support updated security controls, such as logging. For example, PowerShell version 5 and later includes Script Block Logging (SBL), which can record the content of executed scripts. However, adversaries might try to execute an earlier version of PowerShell that does not support SBL. This tactic is used to impair defenses and run malicious scripts that would otherwise be detected.
