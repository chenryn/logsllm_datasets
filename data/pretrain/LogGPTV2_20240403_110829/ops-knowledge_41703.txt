User: I have a batch file that runs a python script. I am running Python 3.2. I want to send a variable like an integer or string from the python script back to the batch file, is this possible?
I know I can accept command line arguments in the Python script with sys.argv. Was hoping there was some feature that allows me to do the reverse.
Assistant: Ignacio is dead on. The only thing you can return is your exit status. What I've done previously is have the python script (or EXE in my case) output the next batch file to be run, then you can put in whatever values you'd like and run it. The batch file that calls the python script then calls the batch file you create.
