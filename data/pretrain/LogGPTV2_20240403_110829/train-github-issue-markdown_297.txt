After update atom to 0.189 I have several issues with clipboard.
  1. If I copy something into clipboard from `atom` editor then I can't paste it in any program except atom. For example into `gedit`.
  2. Even worse. If I try to paste it into some text field of any webpage opened in `Google Chrome 41` then Chrome's tab freezes for a long time (several minutes) and then crashes. If I even try to copy some text from webpage opened in `Chrome` while clipboard already contains text copied from `atom` then `Chrome` still freezes (if clipboard contains any value not copied from `atom` then all is ok).
