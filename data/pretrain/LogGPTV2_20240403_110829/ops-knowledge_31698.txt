### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:06:01 to 18:06:06 on October 18th, highlights several recurring issues and events in a Hadoop environment:

1. **Address Change Detection**:
   - The system repeatedly detects an address change for `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000` and for `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`. This is logged multiple times by the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component.

2. **Lease Renewal Failure**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer` component fails to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` for increasing durations (from 64 to 68 seconds). The system indicates that it will retry shortly after each failure.

3. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Errors**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator` component logs errors in contacting the Resource Manager (RM). These errors are logged at 18:06:01, 18:06:03, and 18:06:05.
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component attempts to reconnect to the server `msra-sa-41:8030` with a retry policy of up to 10 retries, with a fixed sleep time of 1 second between retries. This is logged at 18:06:03 and 18:06:05.

4. **Task Progress Monitoring**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskAttemptListenerImpl` component logs the progress of two task attempts:
     - `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000002_0` has a progress of 0.38137424 at 18:06:03 and 18:06:06.
     - `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000001_0` has a progress of 0.37551183 at 18:06:06.

### Key Points
- **Recurring Address Changes**: Multiple address changes are detected, which may indicate network instability or configuration issues.
- **Lease Renewal Failures**: The system is unable to renew the lease for a specific DFS client, which could lead to data integrity or availability issues.
- **RM Communication Issues**: The system is experiencing repeated failures in contacting the Resource Manager, which is critical for resource allocation and job management.
- **Task Progress**: The system is monitoring the progress of specific tasks, indicating ongoing processing.

### Recommendations
- Investigate the cause of the address changes and ensure network stability and correct configuration.
- Check the status and availability of the NameNode and DataNodes to resolve lease renewal failures.
- Review the RM and network configurations to resolve communication errors with the Resource Manager.
- Monitor the task progress and ensure that the jobs are not being impacted by the above issues.
