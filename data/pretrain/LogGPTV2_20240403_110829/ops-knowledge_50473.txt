Assistant: There are several ways to generate random passwords with specific fields using Linux command line tools, the following is one of the methods: 1. Open a terminal and enter command line mode. 2. Enter the following command to generate a random password containing 8 characters: ``` openssl rand -base64 8 ``` or enter the following command to generate a random password containing 10 characters: ``` openssl rand -base64 10 `` ` 3. If you want to ensure that the generated password contains a specific string, you can use the grep command to filter the results. For example, if you want to generate a 10-digit password containing the string "pass", you can enter the following command: ``` openssl rand -base64 10 | grep pass ``` This will generate a 10-digit password containing the string "pass" random code. 4. If you want to generate and save a random password containing a specific string, you can redirect the command output to a file. For example, the following command will generate a random 12-digit password containing the string "password" and save it to a file named "password.txt": ``` openssl rand -base64 12 | grep password > password.txt ```
