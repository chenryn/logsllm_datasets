ABSTRACT
Cost control for the Internet access providers (AP) inﬂu-
ences not only the nominal speeds oﬀered to the customers,
but also other, more controversial, policies related to traf-
ﬁc shaping and discrimination. Given that the cost for the
AP is determined by the peak-hour traﬃc (e.g. through the
95th-percentile), the individual user contribution towards
the aggregate cost is not a linear function of its byte usage.
In this paper we propose a metric for evaluating the contri-
bution each individual user has on the peak demand, that is
based on Shapley value, a well known game-theoretic con-
cept. Given the computational complexity of calculating the
Shapley value, we use a Monte Carlo method for approxi-
mating it with reasonable accuracy. We employ our method-
ology to study a dataset that logs per-subscriber temporal
usage patterns over one month period for 10K broadband
subscribers of a European AP and report observed results.

INTRODUCTION
A large number of Internet Access Provider (AP) adopted
ﬂat-rate pricing as a de-facto standard for charging of broad-
band services as such pricing appears to be preferred by the
customers [18]. This creates many diﬃculties for the APs as
it does not allow APs to transparently control the uplink-
ing (transit + infrastructure) costs and forced many APs

to create nontransparent rules for traﬃc shaping and vio-
late net-neutrality as a means for control of their costs [9].
Using the terminology of [22], uplinking costs are the sin-
gle most expensive component of the costs for broadband
connectivity for a majority of currently used technologies,
including DSL, cable and WiFi (mash and access point).
An important property of the uplinking costs (inﬂuenced
by the transit costs and the cost of infrastructure) is that
they are determined by the peak demand (e.g. through the
95th-percentile) rather than average demand, which makes
it hard to assess per-customer contribution towards these
costs.
Flight ticket prices typically depend on the time of travel
and hotel rooms in tourist resorts are less expensive dur-
ing oﬀ-season. Similarly, a byte downloaded in peak-hour
costs more (for the provider) than a byte of traﬃc in oﬀ-
peak hours.
In this paper we study per-user contribution
in the AP peak hour demand. More precisely, we measure
per-customer contribution towards the 95th-percentile of the
aggregate demand series1. For the purpose of quantifying
per-user contribution to the 95th-percentile, we use Shap-
ley value, an intuitive concept from coalitional game theory
that characterizes fair cost sharing among involved players
(customers). Shapley value framework allows us to: (1) ac-
curately quantify the contribution of each customer towards
the peak-hour traﬃc, (2) analyze the relationship between
the aggregate usage (in bytes) and the peak-hour contribu-
tion and (3) formally measure how cost of bandwidth is re-
lated to the demand pattern. We validate our methodology
over a dataset that logs temporal usage of 10K broadband
customers of a European AP.
Note that we talk about costs customers generate for the
AP rather than the price they pay; retail prices are often
strongly impacted by other market, competition and social
factors [22]. For various mechanisms for pricing the commu-
nication services in the context of revenue (or social welfare)
maximization, see [6].
1.1 Toy example
For measuring the peak demand we use the 95th-percentile
of the aggregate demand, the most standard measure for
billing of the transit traﬃc and an indicator of the network
utilization, used for the dimensioning of the infrastructure;
see Appendix A for a brief description. To understand the
concept of Shapley value and how it applies to the 95th-
1We stress, however, that the framework is general enough
to accommodate any other metric that measures the peak
demand.
75percentile billing let us consider a synthetic example of an
AP ISP providing service to only two users that have de-
mand patterns that are depicted in Figure 1. The user 1
generates a demand of 1M bps during the whole day except
for the four-hour period [15-19h]. The user 2 is idle for 22
hours and generates 3M bps traﬃc during two hours:
[16-
18h]. The 95-th percentile of the aggregate user demand is
the peak-hour traﬃc v95th = 3M bps and the price the ISP
would need to pay to its transit provider is v95th · A0 (where
A0 is the price in USD per M bps). The following question
arises: What is the fair cost sharing among the two involved
users? The Shapley value concept gives an answer to this
question and the intuition behind it is described bellow.
If there was only user 1 or only user 2 in the system, the
95th percentile would have been:
v95th({1}) = 1M bps and v95th({2}) = 3M bps
respectively. As we already observed, the 95th percentile of
the union of these two users is
v95th({1, 2}) = 3M bps.

other words:

(cid:3)
v95th({i}) + (v95th({i, i(cid:2)}) − v95th({i(cid:2)}))
where {i(cid:2)} = {1, 2}\{i}. In our example the per user Shap-
ley values are:
φi =
,
φ1 = 0.5M bps and φ2 = 2.5M bps.
Thus by entering the coalition, the fair cost sharing of the
95th-percentile v95th({1, 2}) = 3M bps would be the one in
which the user 1 is accounted for φ1 = 0.5M bps and the
user 2 for φ2 = 2.5M bps. The nature of the 95th-percentile
pricing is such that even though the user 1 generates in
total 3.3 times more traﬃc than user 2, its contribution to
the 95th-percentile is 5 times lower.
Comment 1. We can learn two lessons from the above
example: ﬁrstly, the user that sends/receives more data does
not necessarily have higher impact on the 95th-percentile;
and secondly, even if a user does not generate any traﬃc in
the peak hours that does not imply that its impact towards
the 95th-percentile is zero. Shapley value balances between
these two extremes (aggregate usage and peak-only usage)
by evaluating the average marginal contribution of each user
(eq. 1).
1.2 Summary of contributions
Brieﬂy, the main contributions of this paper are the fol-
lowing:
• We develop a new methodology for studying heavy
users in an operational ISP. We use the standard con-
cept from cooperational game theory, known as Shap-
ley value, to quantify per-user cost contribution in the
context of 95th-percentile pricing.
• Using the Shapley value methodology, we study a month-
long dataset that tracks temporal usage patterns from
10K broadband users of a European ISP. We quantify
several relevant metrics over this dataset. In particular

we ﬁnd that for approximately 10% of users, the rela-
tive cost contribution (Shapley value) is less than half
of the relative byte usage (oﬀ-peak users), and that for
additional 10% of users the relative cost contribution
is more than twice of their relative byte usage (peak
users). Finally, we use the Shapley value framework
to formalize the intuitive wisdom “a byte in the peak-
hour has a higher value/cost than an oﬀ-peak byte” by
quantifying the hourly per-byte bandwidth prices that
approximate best the measured Shapley value.
2. APPROXIMATING SHAPLEY VALUE
In this section we will brieﬂy introduce the Shapley value
concept for general cooperative games, relate it to our frame-
work in which the cost of a user coalition is determined by
the 95th-percentile of the traﬃc they generate and propose
a randomized method for eﬃciently computing SV for large
number of players.
2.1 Shapley value: deﬁnition
Consider a set N of N players2. For each subset (coali-
tion) S ⊂ N let v(S) be the cost of coalition S. In other
words if S is a coalition of players which agree to cooperate,
then v(S) determines the total cost from this cooperation.
For given cost function v, the Shapley value is a (uniquely
determined) vector (φ1(v), . . . , φN (v)) deﬁned bellow that
is “fair” in that it satisﬁes four intuitive properties (see [20,
23]) for sharing the cost v(N ) that exhibits the coalition of
all players. It can be shown that Shapley value of player i
is determined by
(v(S(π, i)) − v(S(π, i) \ i))

φi(v) =

where π is a permutation or arrival order of set N and S(π, i)
is the set of players arrived in the system not later than
i.
In other words, player i is responsible for its marginal
contribution v(S(π, i))− v(S(π, i)\ i) averaged across all N !
arrival orders π. Note that the Shapley value deﬁned by (1)
satisﬁes (so called eﬃciency) property:
φi(v) = v(N ).

2.2 The 95th-percentile cost
The 95th-percentile billing is a method of measuring band-
width usage based on peak utilization, deﬁned in Appendix

subscriber.
76A. Informally it measures close-to-peak demand but it also
allows usage to exceed a speciﬁed threshold for brief periods
of time without the ﬁnancial penalty.
The setup over which we apply the Shapley value frame-
work is the following. We have the set N of N users that
generate traﬃc over a charging period, say one month. The
charging period is split into T sampling intervals, and at
time t ∈ [1, T ], user i generates the traﬃc Zi(t) (measured
in bytes). For a time series D = (D(1), . . . , D(T )), the 95th-
percentile P95th(D) is deﬁned as the (cid:4) T
(cid:5)-th largest number
of the time series. For a coalition S of users the cost they
generate is determined by the 95th-percentile of the aggre-
gate demand pattern they generate:

(cid:4)
π∈Πk
The parameter k determines the error between the real Shap-
ley value and its estimate: the higher k the lower the error.
So basically, one can control the accuracy of the estimators
by increasing the number of sample permutation orders (see
Section 3.2).
Proposition 1. The estimator ˆφi(v) is an unbiased es-
timator of the real Shapley value φi(v).
v(S) = P95th(
Zi(1), . . . ,
Zi(T )).
Proof. See [21].
Given the cost function v(·), the contribution of each user to
the 95th-percentile of the aggregate traﬃc v(N ) is deﬁned
by the Shapley value deﬁned by (1). From the deﬁnition,
one can notice that the 95th-percentile does not decrease by
adding new users to the coalition, therefore implying that
the cost function v is monotone:
(∀S ⊂ N )(∀i ∈ N ) v(S ∪ i) ≥ v(S).
The monotonicity of the cost function v implies that the
Shapley value of each user is indeed nonnegative.
