### Concatenation and URL Recognition
In Table 1, Class C6, W3af and Skipfish passed only six out of 27 tests. In these six successful tests, the URL was stored in a JavaScript variable while preserving the URL path separator. Using regular expressions, W3af and Skipfish identified the string as a URL and submitted it to the server, thus passing the tests. However, in the remaining 21 tests, URLs were created by concatenating string variables and JavaScript arrays. While regular expressions can be extended to handle these specific cases, they are unlikely to be as comprehensive as dynamic analysis.

### Assessment Using Web Applications
We compare j¨Ak with other crawlers by evaluating their performance on popular web applications.

### Evaluation of Crawlers
To evaluate how well the crawlers cover a web application, we use code coverage, which measures the number of lines of code exercised by the testing tool. However, this measure is not ideal for web crawlers, as they operate in a black-box setting with limited visibility and do not fuzz input fields. Instead, they use a user-provided list of inputs, which may not exercise all branches, leaving significant portions of the web application unvisited. An alternative measure is the number of URLs a crawler can extract.

A web crawler provides a web scanner with URLs to test. The detection power of a web scanner, measured by the number of reported vulnerabilities, is another important aspect. However, this metric can be unfair because different scanners support different classes of vulnerabilities and may target different vulnerabilities. Thus, the number of discovered vulnerabilities is not directly comparable among different crawlers.

### Case Studies
We assessed j¨Ak using 13 popular web applications, including:
- Content management systems: Joomla 3.4.1, Modx-CMS 2.02.14, and Nibbleblog 4.0.1.
- Blogging tools with plugins: WordPress 3.7 and 4.0.1, and Tidio 1.1.
- Discussion forum software: MyBB 1.8.01 and 1.8.04, and phpBB 3.0.12.
- Photo gallery applications: Gallery 2.7.1 and Piwigo 2.7.1.
- Cloud storage applications: OwnCloud 4.0.1 and 8.0.3.
- Wiki web application: MediaWiki 1.24.2.

These applications vary in size, complexity, and functionality. We set up each web application on our own servers, installed in virtual machines, and reset the state of the virtual machines before each test.

### Results
Our evaluation results are divided into two parts:
1. **Diversity of Events**: Table 2 shows the number of unique event-handler registrations extracted by j¨Ak, grouped by event category (DDI, DII, Change events, API events, Error events, and custom errors). This data is derived from the dynamic analysis of client-side JavaScript programs.
2. **Coverage and Detection Power**: We measure the number of unique URL structures each crawler found, excluding static and external resources. Table 3 presents these results, with numbers in bold indicating the tool that extracted the highest number of URL structures. The symbol * indicates that the results for W3af and Skipfish do not include invalid URLs found via URL forgery.

In summary, j¨Ak outperforms existing crawlers in terms of coverage and the diversity of events it can detect, making it a robust tool for testing modern web applications.
