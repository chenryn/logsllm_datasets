Bank, Apple, Verizon). For example, P23 comments: “I usually
call my carrier (Comcast) and they have security stuff for your
internet and they’ll tell me what I can do.”
Negative Experiences.
As reported in Rader and Wash’s
work on security stories, negative events described by peers
or directly experienced by participants can be strong learning
tools [3]. In our study, we found that 24 participants either
had negative experiences themselves or were told stories
of negative-security events by peers, which led to behavior
changes. The distribution of the types of negative-security
situations (events that happened to the participant,
to the
participant’s friend, or that the participant heard about through
TV) on which participants relied is shown in Figure 2. Our
participant sample was smaller, yet broader, than that used
in Rader and Wash’s work, and our results thus conﬁrm the
generalizability of their ﬁndings beyond the college student
population [3].
Participants tend not to learn from security stories told by
others or from events that happen to themselves when they feel
that they or the victim did all they could to prevent the event,
when they feel that they or the victim placed themselves in
harm’s way, or when they cannot ﬁnd a cause for the negative
event. For example, P2 had a friend who was robbed, but did
not change her own behavior “because I think she took all the
precautions she reasonably could. She parked in a brightly lit
area and a reasonably safe neighborhood...I don’t think that
there was much...[that she could] have changed.” P24 and P9
have had friends who got viruses, but they did not do anything
differently afterwards, because they felt that the friends were
victimized due to their lack of technical expertise. Finally, P18
comments, “I actually think recently someone tried to log into
my email from China and Google sent me an email and Google
blocked it and said it looked strange and I said it was very
strange,” but he did not alter his behavior after this incident.
Although only four participants cited TV shows speciﬁcally,
each strongly recalled stories of negative physical or digital
security-related events happening to characters in those shows.
They directly credited these shows with leading to a speciﬁc
change in their behavior. For example, P12 put a password
on his WiFi network after watching a tech show that showed
“people going by houses and WiFi snooping and knocking
on people’s doors saying, ‘Oh your WiFi is open, you need
to protect it’ . . . shows like that, [they] make you think.” P14
had a similar experience: watching a movie motivated her to
always check the back seats in her car for a lurking person.
“People had mentioned that you should check your back seats
before but I never paid attention to it until [this] movie,” she
says. Thus, it seems that TV shows or movies may serve as
strong proxies for a negative experience that happens directly
to the user or someone she knows. We hypothesize two reasons
for this: (1) while participants often blamed themselves or
their friends for personality or behavioral ﬂaws that led to
security problems, they were more likely to give relatable
ﬁctional characters or the unknown real victims shown on TV
the beneﬁt of the doubt; and (2) TV shows and movies are
typically designed to be vivid, realistic, and believable, thus
making participants feel that what is happening on the screen
could happen to them, too.
Evaluating Authority in Common Advice Sources.
Prior
work has identiﬁed media, family, and peers as important
sources of digital-security advice [2]. Our results conﬁrm
these ﬁndings, and offer additional insights into which media
participants feel is most authoritative and how participants
evaluate the expertise of their family and peers.
Almost all participants (N=24) reported receiving both
digital- and physical-security information from media. Media
included online articles, forums, television shows, news shows,
the radio, magazines, and advertisements. Of the participants
who cited media as an advice source for digital security,
ﬁve participants cited a speciﬁc technology-oriented resource
as authoritative or trustworthy: “Some of the blog[s] I read
[are] by computer people, those are the most trustworthy. For
example, I read Wired,” says P20. In general, the technical
sources cited by these participants were: CNet, Wired, Bruce
Schneier’s blog and Mashable. [51]–[54].
Another common source of digital- and physical-security
advice are family members (N=21) and peers (N=15). In
describing why they chose to take security advice from their
family members or friends, 11 participants said they consulted
their peer or family member because they considered this per-
son an expert. For example, P1 says he always asks his father-
in-law for digital security information because his father-in-
law is “a bit of a techie in his spare time. He’s the one that I
go to for advice and feedback, new stuff, articles, he’ll send
links. He knows the best of what’s going on.” Interestingly,
however, expert status in our sample was not necessarily
determined by education or job role (e.g. IT professional,
police ofﬁcer) but rather by participant’s perceptions of the
“tech-savviness” or physical-security expertise of their peer or
277277

family member.P3 says that he purchased anti-virus software
at his father’s direction. He says, he’s “very tech-savvy and
he’ll say, ‘You need to get this. This is important.’ I don’t
question him because he’s very much in the know.” When
asked what makes his father ‘tech-savvy’, P3 says “he’s always
loved computers and all that entails, but he doesn’t work in
technology.” Further exploration of speciﬁc cues leveraged by
users to assess the ‘tech-savvy’ or expertise of their friends,
family, and the media could aid researchers in signaling
advice-source trustworthiness, which is a primary motivator
for users’ acceptance of digital-security advice, as discussed
further in IV-C.
Gender and Advice.
Eighteen participants, evenly split
between men and women, cited a man as a source of digital-
security advice, while only three cited a woman. If this trend
holds true among a larger population,
it may be because
men have historically been overrepresented in technology
and computing ﬁelds and thus are considered to be more
authoritative on that topic [55]. Alternatively, men may simply
offer more unsolicited advice in the domain of digital security,
or perhaps because women are still underrepresented in IT and
computing ﬁelds there are fewer women who chose to offer
digital-security advice [56].
On the other hand, 12 participants cited a woman as a
source of physical-security advice, compared to three partic-
ipants who cited men. Eight of these 12 participants who
received physical-security advice from women were women
themselves. Historically, women have had higher rates of
crime victimization, perceive themselves to be at higher risk
of victimization, and express greater fear of crime than do
men [57]. It is probable that women are aware of this gendered
difference in threat levels and perceptions, and thus ﬁnd each
other more relatable sources of advice.
C. Why Advice is Accepted
What leads users to accept advice from the sources men-
tioned above? In this section, we discuss participants’ reasons
for accepting security advice. We ﬁnd that the trustworthiness
of the advice source is the key metric for digital security. This
ﬁnding may be explained by another of our ﬁndings: partic-
ipants struggle to assess the plausibility and value of digital-
security advice. In contrast, participants’ relative conﬁdence
in their assessment of the plausibility of and necessity for
physical-security advice leads them to cite their own evaluation
of the advice’s content as the primary assessment metric in
the physical domain. We also in this section compare which
advice, physical or digital, participants feel is more useful
and/or more trustworthy.
Digital-Security Advice.
Eleven participants used the trust-
worthiness of the advice source to determine whether to take
digital-security advice.
In the case of media advice, participants must determine
whether advice offered by an unknown author is trustworthy.
Participants mentioned ﬁve heuristics that they use to measure
the trustworthiness of a media advice source, including: their
knowledge and trust of the advice author, other users’ reviews
of the advice, how widespread the advice was on various
media outlets, whether the content of the advice differed
strongly from their current behavior, and the simplicity of the
advice. All of these heuristics were equally prevalent in our
data.
The ﬁrst technique mentioned for evaluating media advice
source trustworthiness was to assess the author or media outlet
providing the advice: P20 notes that her acceptance of advice,
“depends on the author and how the article is written.” P22
says he ﬁnds advice useful “If I would quote that source to
someone else, like the Washington Post, [or another] reputable
media outlet. If it’s just some Matt Drudge on the Internet
advising about computer security, I would just ignore that more
quickly than I saw it.”
A second evaluation metric was other users’ reviews of the
advice. Two security-sensitive participants, one who holds an
M.S. in digital security (P24) and another who handled FERPA
data as an HR ﬁle clerk (P10), crowd-sourced their advice and
software evaluation. P24 comments, “I evaluate howto videos
and other advice channels via user comments.” Similarly, P10
says, “I look at reviews and the software and the website to
decide whether to use the advice or download [software]. I
look at whether it has a good reputation—whether it is popular
with online reviewing.”
A third heuristic for advice evaluation was how widespread
across different media outlets the advice became, with the im-
plicit assumption that distribution outlets who reprinted a given
piece of advice had evaluated the sources and information and
found it to be valid. P25 comments that he trusts “news that’s
backed up by facts and is across multiple channels, because
if it’s not good, multiple places won’t pick it up.”
A fourth metric for evaluating a media advice-source trust-
worthiness was how much the content of the advice differed
from the participant’s current behavior: P5 says she took the
advice because “it was the opposite of what I was doing, so it
automatically made it seem as though it was more credible.”
P2 comments that she took the advice since “it made sense;
I guess if [my password is] a bit longer, it’s harder for [a
malicious] computer to ﬁgure it out.”
Finally, a ﬁfth heuristic for media advice-source evaluation
is the simplicity of the advice. P2 adds, “If it’s just tips that
you can implement in your everyday life, then the advice feels
more trustworthy” and P16 wishes that advice “would have a
better setup to say ‘Here, this is what you have to do for step
one, step two, step three.’ . . . like from Google when they’re
saying that you can [add] privacy.”
Participants may rely on the trustworthiness of the advice
source because they are not conﬁdent in their own ability to
evaluate the content of the advice. Indeed, P7 says, “physical
security is related more to me and my body . . . it makes sense
to me whereas with computer security, I’m securing myself
from threats that I don’t even know anything about...I know
when somebody walks up with a gun that I should be worried.”
P12 also notes that the tangibility of physical security can
make personal safety strategies more trustworthy and easier to

implement, commenting, “you know, cyber security is great,
but the people who are doing it are so smart that they can put
back doors in it that you don’t even know about, so sometimes,
I don’t even trust the advice...with physical security, I can
touch that, or I know someone that I can relate to.”
That said, participants’ ability to accurately judge the trust-
worthiness of advice sources may vary. As an example of good
advice, P9 learned to use incognito browsing from a friend,
“incognito came out in college and a friend came over and
needed to use gmail and just said look at this and logged
himself into gmail and didn’t need to log me out and it was
useful.” Similarly, P15 learned about security alarm systems
“years ago, from a friend of mine who had a security alarm
business.” However, P17 mentioned being told less credible
information such as the following: “A lot of my friends don’t
have iPhones because, this is the term they use, ‘iPhones are
hot’. Like they attract all the attention to your phone, like
anything you’re doing illegal it can get caught on your phone,
‘cause it’s like a hot box iPhone. It can be tracked in any
type of way, stuff like that. I didn’t even know that, I was like
whoaaaaa it can be tracked? If I had known that, I wouldn’t
have gotten an iPhone, yeah.”
Physical-security advice. As participants are more conﬁ-
dent in their ability to evaluate the plausibility of physical-
security advice content, for physical security,
the advice
source is of lesser importance. Only three participants cite the
trustworthiness of a physical-advice source as an important
metric, and those participants also cited this metric for digital
security. Instead, participants rely on their own assessments of
physical-security advice to determine whether to implement
new behaviors (N=7). On the subject of plausibility, P22 says
about physical-security advice, “if it doesn’t pass the smell
test, in other words if it just doesn’t seem plausible, then I
dismiss it. If it’s something that I recognize as making sense,”
then he will consider implementing it.
Digital vs. Physical Advice: Usefulness and Trust.
Figure 3 shows participants’ assessments of the trustworthi-
ness and usefulness of digital- and physical-security advice.
Half of our participants (N=13) felt that physical-security
advice was more trustworthy overall than digital-security ad-
vice. Only two participants felt that digital-security advice was
more trustworthy than physical-security advice. The remaining
10 participants felt that digital- and physical-security advice
was equally trustworthy. We suspect that this was largely be-
cause, as mentioned above, participants ﬁnd physical-security
advice easier to mentally evaluate (N=7). P9 comments that
he would probably trust physical-security advice more than
digital-security advice because: “there are a lot fewer variables.
I trust it more because it’s easier to evaluate if it’s legitimate.”
Similarly, P23 says that she trusts physical-security advice
more because it is “more hands on and visual, it’s in your
face a little bit more.”
Relatedly, ﬁve participants trust physical-security advice
more because they feel it is simpler and easier to implement
than digital-security advice. “Physical-security advice is more
trustworthy because it’s more common sense and they don’t
typically require you to download and install something that
would be trouble in itself,” comments P20.
Participants are more split on which advice, digital or phys-
ical, is more useful. Nine participants feel that physical advice
is more useful, primarily for the same reasons they found
physical advice more trustworthy: “I can see the relevance
in the personal security whereas the computer security, again
I am trusting that because I have a little icon on the right that
it is doing its job. Do I know what it it’s doing? No.” says P7.
Similarly, P3 comments that he ﬁnds physical-security advice
more useful because: “Again, it’s my understanding. It just
comes so much more naturally.”
On the other hand, the 10 participants who feel that digital
advice is more useful noted that there are more techniques
available for digital than physical security and that they feel
a higher risk of digital threats. To the ﬁrst point, P15 says:
“digital-security advice is more useful—because with digital
I can probably do more research, and there’s more to do
there than the physical. Physical you can only do so much,
I don’t care what I have on me, someone can overpower me.”
With regard to feeling that there is more digital than physical
security risk, P11 comments, “[I] ﬁnd digital security more
useful and more trustworthy because there is so much more
research on it and it’s so much more pervasive.”
D. Why Advice is Rejected
While trustworthiness and plausibility are the two main
reasons our participants choose to accept advice, there are a
multitude of reasons for which they reject it. Inconvenience is
often cited as a possible explanation for users rejecting digital-
security advice [6], [7], [58], but it was not the most prevalent
reason we discovered. Our participants related frustrations
with advice content, such as the content being too marketing-
oriented, or less surprisingly, too advanced. They also rejected
digital-security advice when they believed that they were not
at risk or felt that implementing security measures was not
their job. Figure 4 summarizes the prevalence of these reasons
for rejecting digital- and physical-security advice. Below, we
provide further detail on these reasons, and compare and
contrast participants’ motivations for rejecting advice in each
domain.
Too Much Marketing.
Eight participants rejected digital-
and physical-security advice because it appears to be more
about selling a product than about providing advice: “I don’t
do anything with a price tag attached. I could be persuaded to
do it if I had a serious problem. I did have my identity stolen

one time but I was able to ﬁx it, but I’m not one of these people
who signs up for [identity theft protection] or something like
that,” says P22. Similarly, P16 wishes that physical-security
advice could be more substantive and distributed primarily
through mechanisms other than advertisements.
I’m Not At Risk.
Eight participants rejected physical-
security advice as unnecessary due to their low risk proﬁle.
For example, P24 says: “[I’ve] heard about 24-7 monitoring
and crap like that, I think it’s overkill. If everyone [in my
neighborhood] was driving fancy cars, maybe.”
Four participants rejected digital-security advice for the
same reason. P5 says he does not put a password on his
phone because, “I just don’t feel I have that much interesting
stuff on there.” P10 comments that she does not use or look
for security tactics for her tablet, because “there’s nothing
personal on the tablet.” Similarly, P3 does not take security
advice for browsing because he is “not so concerned about
browsing as opposed to personal ﬁnancial information.” The
participants who cited these feelings for digital security were
of varied incomes, and the overall incidence of feelings of
“unimportance” around digital security was quite low. This
is in contrast to prior work, which had proposed that many
users, particularly those with lower incomes, might not execute
security behaviors due to low valuation of their data [5]. One
possible cause for this change is that as technology becomes
