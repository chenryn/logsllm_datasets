 **Context:**

  * Operating System: Mac
  * Node.js version: 16.13.1
  * Browser: Chromium at least, but likely all.
  * Extra: On M1 Mac Ventura
**Code Snippet**
Small repo that shows the issue
**Describe the bug**
I have global setup configured in playwright-config.ts:
      globalSetup: "./global-setup",
      use: {
        // Tell all tests to load signed-in state from 'storageState.json'.
        storageState: "storageState.json",
      },
This global setup fails to apply. The test in `login.spec.ts` fails to "see"
the localStorage info that is persisted in storageState.json. As a workaround,
I can add this to the top of login.spec.ts, and it works:
    test.use({
      storageState: "storageState.json",
    });
But that shouldn't be necessary per these docs:
