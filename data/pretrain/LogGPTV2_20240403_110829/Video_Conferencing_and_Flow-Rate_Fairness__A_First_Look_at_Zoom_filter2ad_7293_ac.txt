5 Conclusion
In this work, we recognize the impact of video conferencing on Internet stability
and investigate congestion control fairness in combination with Zoom. Flow-rate
equality as fairness measure is well researched for TCP’s congestion control and
for real-world TCP ﬂows in the Internet. However, for congestion control of video
conferencing software it is not – speciﬁcally regarding diﬀerent scenarios. Hence,
we investigate Zoom as increasingly popular real-world deployment of video con-
ferencing. We ﬁnd that Zoom uses high shares of bandwidth in low-bandwidth
scenarios yielding it when more bandwidth is available. Adding AQM, such as
CoDel, alone does not improve the bandwidth sharing, but reduces latency which
is probably beneﬁcial for Zoom. Only when also using ﬂow-queuing, more equal

bandwidth sharing can be achieved with FQ CoDel. However, this fair sharing
comes at the price of reduced bandwidth and packet loss for Zoom, potentially
reducing its QoE. Our small-scale user study found that FQ CoDel did not
improve the QoE. For future work, we imagine a more thorough user study to
evaluate Zoom’s QoE with AQM such as FQ CoDel in more detail. Further,
testing Zoom’s reaction on ECN and multiple Zoom ﬂows competing could give
interesting information on its behavior on backbone congestion.

Appendix
In the following, we present results of a small-scale user study which we con-
ducted to analyze whether our ﬁndings regarding packet loss but also improve-
ments regarding delay have positive or negative impact on Zoom’s subjective
quality. However, as our study was performed with a limited number of partici-
pants due to COVID-19 restrictions, we had to restrict the number of scenarios
that we could investigate. Thus, the results and their generalizability are limited
and this study should be regarded as an initial step in understanding how QoE,
queuing and Zoom interact.
A QoE Impact of Flow-Queuing AQM
As we have shown in Sect. 4.4, ﬂow-queuing AQM can achieve more equal ﬂow-
rates and reduce latency when Zoom and TCP share a bottleneck. However, this
means lower bandwidths for Zoom, so likely worse video quality. In contrast,
lower latencies should probably mean better interactivity. As the exact correla-
tion w.r.t. perceived experience is hard to grasp, we perform a small-scale user
study to capture the inﬂuence of ﬂow-rate equality and AQM reduced latency
on Zoom’s QoE.
Limitations of this Study. However, our study is limited, as we had to limit
the number of participants (n = 10) due to COVID-19 restrictions. As such, we
also restricted the number of scenarios to keep the individual study duration
to roughly 25 min. Additionally, we had to switch from synthetically generated
videos (noise to maximize bandwidth utilization) that we used throughout Sect. 4
to real video-conferences. This makes it diﬃcult to compare the video-ﬂows’
demands from our synthetic evaluation to this user study as the bandwidth
demand varies with the compression rate (higher compression for actual webcam
video). In summary, our study should only be regarded as an initial step.
In the following, we introduce the design and stimuli of our study and which
metrics we are interested in. Subsequently, we present the results.

A.1 User Study Design
We perform a video conference where the subject interacts with an experiment
assistant via Zoom focusing on interactivity and understandability to rate the
quality and whether potentially degraded quality is acceptable when a concurrent
download is active. The assistant reads short paragraphs of texts and the subject
shortly summarizes them once the paragraph ended. This way, we test whether
the video conference allowed for easy understanding but also represent the typical
condition where conference attendees interrupt each other unintentionally. After
5 repetitions of summarizing, the subject and assistant alternately count to 10
to get a feeling for the delay, as proposed by the ITU [4]. Lastly, the assistant
reads random numbers and the subject stops the assistant at a given number
(unknown to the assistant) for the same reasons.
Quality Rating. After every run, the subject rates the overall, audio, video, and
interactivity quality on a seven-point linear scale [5] (c.f., y-axis in Fig. 8). More-
over, the subject decides (yes/no) if communicating was challenging, whether the
connection was acceptable at all, whether the quality was acceptable if they were
downloading a ﬁle during a business or private call or when someone else was
downloading documents or watching movies in parallel.
Test Conditions. We test 3 diﬀerent scenarios using our previously described
testbed; for all conditions, we shape the subject’s link to 0.5 Mbps, adjust the
min. RTTs to 50 ms and use a queue size of 10×BDP. The scenarios diﬀer in
whether an extra ﬂow competes on the downlink and whether the queue is man-
aged. In detail, in Scenario 1 (Tail-Drop) only Zoom is active using a tail-drop
queue. Scenario 2 (Tail-Drop + Flow) adds a TCP CUBIC ﬂow on the downlink,
representing, e.g., a movie download. Scenario 3 (FQ CoDel + Flow) adopts the
TCP ﬂow, but switches to the ﬂow-queuing variant of CoDel.
Study Details. We perform a “within subject” lab study: each subject rates
every test condition selected from a latin square to randomize the order. Each
experiment takes about 5 min and is repeated for the 3 scenarios plus a training
phase at the start using Scenario 1. In total, the 4 experiments plus rating take
about 25 min. Although conducting studies with members familiar to the study
is discouraged [4], we stick to the same experiment assistant to reduce variations.
Subject Recruitment. Our subjects are 10 colleagues from our institute which
volunteered to take part and are strongly familiar with Zoom. We limited our
study to these participants to reduce contacts during the pandemic. As such we
were able to hold the conferences in the participant’s ﬁrst language.
A.2 Results
Figure 8a shows the mean opinion score and 95% conﬁdence intervals of the
quality rating (distributions checked for normality via a Shapiro-Wilk test). The
conﬁdence intervals are computed via the t-distribution due to our small sample

size. Further, Fig. 8b shows the distributions of “Yes” (positive, to the right) and
“No” (negative, to the left) answers for the diﬀerent questions.
Generally looking at the plots we can see that the worst results stem from
using FQ CoDel, while using a tail-drop queue with no concurrent ﬂow results in
the best quality ratings. For the overall quality of the video conference and the
video quality this diﬀerence is statistically signiﬁcant as the conﬁdence intervals
do not overlap. However, for the scenarios where Zoom competes with TCP ﬂows,
the results are statistically insigniﬁcant and allow no statement. Similar, all audio
quality and interactivity votes allow no statistically signiﬁcant statement.
Flow-Queuing AQM Induced QoE Changes. Hence, interpreting these
results is complex. What can be said is that CoDel’s positive eﬀect of reduc-
ing the queuing delay was not perceived by the users. On the other hand, also
the reduction in bandwidth did not yield any statistically signiﬁcant quality
reduction. However, a trend against using FQ CoDel is visible, but it cannot
be statistically reasoned. Only following the trend, it might be not worth using
FQ CoDel due to its potentially worse QoE. Otherwise, only few users considered
the connection unacceptable (c.f. Fig. 8b), surprisingly uncorrelated to whether
FQ CoDel was used or whether a concurrent ﬂow was actually started. I.e., some
users considered our scenarios generally as unacceptable regardless of FQ CoDel.
Inﬂuence of Concurrent Downloads on Acceptability. Surprisingly, users
also consider the quality unacceptable when imagining a concurrent download of
documents in business or private conversations. We expected that users accept
deteriorations, as they would not pay attention to the video conference, but want
their download to complete. However, speciﬁcally in the business case, our users
did not. Also quality deteriorations induced by other users downloading movies
or documents were not seen more disturbing. I.e., independent of self-inﬂicted
or not, some users do not accept quality deteriorations at all, while others do.
Takeaway. Unfortunately, our study did not yield statistically conclusive results
with respect to how participants perceive the diﬀerence in Zoom quality between
using a tail-drop queue and FQ CoDel when a ﬂow competes. Also regarding
acceptance, users did not see strong diﬀerences and either disliked the quality

regardless of possible concurrent downloads as reasons or just accepted it, dis-
agreeing on a generally applicable statement. Looking at the general trend of our
study, FQ CoDel could decrease QoE.
