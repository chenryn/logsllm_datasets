### 5. Conclusion

In this work, we examined the impact of video conferencing, specifically Zoom, on Internet stability and investigated congestion control fairness in various scenarios. Flow-rate equality, a well-studied fairness measure for TCP congestion control, has not been extensively researched for video conferencing software, particularly under different conditions. Therefore, we focused on Zoom, an increasingly popular video conferencing tool, to understand its behavior in low-bandwidth and high-bandwidth scenarios.

Our findings indicate that Zoom tends to use a significant portion of available bandwidth in low-bandwidth situations but yields when more bandwidth is available. Adding Active Queue Management (AQM) techniques, such as CoDel, alone does not improve bandwidth sharing but reduces latency, which can be beneficial for Zoom. However, only when combined with flow-queuing (FQ CoDel), more equitable bandwidth sharing is achieved. This fairness comes at the cost of reduced bandwidth and increased packet loss for Zoom, potentially degrading its Quality of Experience (QoE).

A small-scale user study revealed that FQ CoDel did not enhance the QoE. Future work should include a more comprehensive user study to evaluate Zoom's QoE with AQM techniques like FQ CoDel in greater detail. Additionally, testing Zoom's response to Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) and multiple competing Zoom flows could provide valuable insights into its behavior during backbone congestion.

### Appendix

#### A. QoE Impact of Flow-Queuing AQM

As shown in Section 4.4, flow-queuing AQM can achieve more equal flow-rates and reduce latency when Zoom and TCP share a bottleneck. However, this results in lower bandwidths for Zoom, potentially leading to worse video quality. Conversely, lower latencies should improve interactivity. To better understand the perceived experience, we conducted a small-scale user study to assess the influence of flow-rate equality and AQM-reduced latency on Zoom's QoE.

#### A.1. User Study Design

We performed a video conference where participants interacted with an experiment assistant via Zoom, focusing on interactivity and understandability to rate the quality. The assistant read short paragraphs, and the participant summarized them. This tested the ease of understanding and represented typical interruptions in conferences. After five repetitions, the participant and assistant alternately counted to ten to gauge delay, as suggested by the ITU [4]. Finally, the assistant read random numbers, and the participant stopped the assistant at a given number to further test interactivity.

**Quality Rating:** Participants rated the overall, audio, video, and interactivity quality on a seven-point linear scale [5] after each run. They also decided whether communication was challenging, if the connection was acceptable, and if the quality was acceptable during a concurrent download in business or private calls.

**Test Conditions:** We tested three scenarios:
1. **Scenario 1 (Tail-Drop):** Only Zoom active using a tail-drop queue.
2. **Scenario 2 (Tail-Drop + Flow):** Added a TCP CUBIC flow on the downlink.
3. **Scenario 3 (FQ CoDel + Flow):** Adopted the TCP flow with FQ CoDel.

**Study Details:** We conducted a within-subject lab study with each participant rating all conditions in a randomized order. Each experiment took about 5 minutes, repeated for the three scenarios plus a training phase, totaling approximately 25 minutes. Despite the recommendation against using familiar assistants, we used the same assistant to minimize variations.

**Subject Recruitment:** Ten colleagues from our institute, who are familiar with Zoom, volunteered to participate. The study was limited to these participants due to COVID-19 restrictions, allowing us to conduct the conferences in the participants' first language.

#### A.2. Results

Figure 8a shows the mean opinion scores and 95% confidence intervals for the quality ratings (normality checked via the Shapiro-Wilk test). Figure 8b displays the distributions of "Yes" and "No" answers for the different questions.

Overall, the worst results were from using FQ CoDel, while the best quality ratings came from using a tail-drop queue without a concurrent flow. The difference in overall and video quality was statistically significant, but other metrics showed no significant differences.

**Interpretation:** CoDel's reduction in queuing delay was not noticeable to users, and the bandwidth reduction did not significantly affect quality. However, there was a trend indicating that FQ CoDel might not be worth using due to potential QoE degradation. Few users found the connection unacceptable, regardless of FQ CoDel usage or concurrent downloads.

**Concurrent Downloads:** Surprisingly, users considered the quality unacceptable even when imagining a concurrent document download in business or private conversations. This suggests that some users do not accept any quality deterioration, while others do.

**Takeaway:** Our study did not yield statistically conclusive results regarding the perception of Zoom quality differences between tail-drop and FQ CoDel. Users either disliked the quality regardless of reasons or accepted it, making a general statement difficult. Overall, FQ CoDel may decrease QoE.
