Assistant: At 16:15:39, the PanelView and PhoneStatusBar components of the system log began a series of processes to update the notification shade. The StackScrollAlgorithm component was used to update the clipping and dimmed activated hide sensitive settings. The PhoneStatusBar component then disabled certain features and resumed suspended autohide. Finally, the StackScrollAlgorithm was used again to update the clipping and dimmed activated hide sensitive settings.
