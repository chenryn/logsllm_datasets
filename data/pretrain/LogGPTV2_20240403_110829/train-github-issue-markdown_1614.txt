This approach introduces additional overhead on the client side when parsing errors. Specifically, the client must recheck the content type for each error to avoid misinterpreting plain text as JSON, which can cause issues with some libraries.

To address this, it is recommended that the error message format be standardized. Below are examples of how this standardization could be implemented:

- **404 Not Found**
  - Content-Type: `text/plain; charset=utf-8`

- **405 Method Not Allowed**
  - Content-Type: `text/plain; charset=utf-8`

- **409 Conflict**
  - Content-Type: `application/json; charset=utf-8`

- **500 Internal Server Error**
  - Content-Type: `application/json; charset=utf-8`

By consistently using the appropriate `Content-Type` and including the `charset` parameter, we can ensure that the client can correctly parse the error messages without unnecessary checks.
