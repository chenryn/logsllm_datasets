This causes overhead on client side when parsing the errors since need to
recheck content type for every error in order not to parse plain text as json
(some libraries fail on that).  
The errors message format should be standardized.
Examples:  
404: Page Not Found  
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
405 Method Not Allowed  
Content-Type: text/plain
409 Conflict  
Content-Type: application/json
500 Internal Server Error  
Content-Type: application/json
