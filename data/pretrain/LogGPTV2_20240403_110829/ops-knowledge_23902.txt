User: I am using the python prompt to practice some regular expressions. I was wondering if there was a way to use the up/down arrows (like bash) to cycle through the old commands typed. I know its possible since it works on python on cygwin/windows.
thanks
Assistant: If you compile python with readline support, the REPL environment should do this for you.
