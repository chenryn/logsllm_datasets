Abstract
Correlating and analyzing security alerts is a critical
and challenging task in security management. Recently,
some techniques have been proposed for security alert cor-
relation. However, these approaches focus more on basic
or low-level alert correlation. In this paper, we study how
to conduct probabilistic inference to correlate and analyze
attack scenarios. Speciﬁcally, we propose an approach to
solving the following problems: 1) How to correlate iso-
lated attack scenarios resulted from low-level alert cor-
relation? 2) How to identify attacker’s high-level strate-
gies and intentions? 3) How to predict the potential attacks
based on observed attack activities? We evaluate our ap-
proaches using DARPA’s Grand Challenge Problem (GCP)
data set. The results demonstrate the capability of our ap-
proach in correlating isolated attack scenarios, identifying
attack strategies and predicting future attacks.
Keywords: Intrusion detection, alert correlation, security
management, attack scenario analysis.
1. Introduction
Many security sensors and systems can be deployed to
provide defense-in-depth for systems and networks. How-
ever, the large volume of security alerts makes it challeng-
ing for security operators to analyze the attack situation and
take an appropriate response.
Alert correlation and analysis is a critical task in se-
curity management. Recently, several techniques and ap-
proaches have been proposed to correlate and analyze se-
curity alerts, including alert similarity measurement [30],
probabilistic reasoning [16, 25], clustering algorithms [14],
pre-/post-condition matching of known attacks [21, 11, 7],
statistical-based analysis [24] and chronicles formalism ap-
proach [20]. All these approaches focus on the aggregation
and analysis of raw security alerts, and build basic or low-
level attack scenarios. However, in practice, an alert corre-
lation system should have a hierarchical architecture. The
analysis is conducted from low-level alert correlation to ab-
stract scenario analysis at high levels. In addition, there al-
ways exist isolated attack scenarios derived from low-level
alert correlation due to various reasons, e.g., IDSs miss de-
tecting critical attacks. Therefore, in addition to the low-
level correlation analysis, it is necessary to develop algo-
rithms and tools for security analysts to further analyze and
correlate attack scenarios so that they can make situation
and mission assessment accurately, and take appropriate re-
sponses to minimize the damages. In addition, threat analy-
sis and attack prediction are also helpful and important for
security operators to take actions in advance to avoid poten-
tial attacks and damages.
Recognizing attack plans is one of the goals of security
analysts. Plan recognition has been a research area in ar-
tiﬁcial intelligence (AI) for decades. In AI, plan recogni-
tion is a process of inferring the goals of an agent from ob-
servations of the agent’s activities. Plan recognition can be
characterized as keyhole recognition and intended recogni-
tion based on the role of an agent whose plan is being in-
ferred [9]. In keyhole recognition, the agent is not aware that
its action is being observed, i.e., the agent is only engaged in
the task and does not attempt to impact the recognition pro-
cess. In intended recognition, the agent attempts to perform
actions that can aid the recognition of its plan, e.g., a lan-
guage understanding system [9].
However, in attack plan recognition, traditional plan
recognition techniques cannot be applied. Unlike the tra-
ditional agent that either aids the recognition of its plan
or does not attempt to impact the recognition of the pro-
cess, attackers can perform activities to escape detection
and avoid the recognition of their attack strategies. There-
fore, this type of recognition process can be categorized as
adversary recognition that is more challenging and more
uncertain in the recognition process. In addition, some as-
sumptions of traditional plan recognition techniques are not
valid anymore. First, in plan recognition, there is always an
assumption that there exists a valid plan in the plan library
that the agent can reach. In network security, we cannot as-
sume that we have a complete attack plan library that in-

cludes all of the possible strategies of attackers. Therefore,
we have to deal with the case that the observed attacker’s
activity is beyond or partially matched with our pre-deﬁned
attack plans. Second, plan recognition assumes a complete,
ordered set of tasks for a plan. However, in security con-
text, we cannot always observe all of the attacker’s activi-
ties, and often can only detect incomplete attack steps due
to the limitation or deployment of security sensors. There-
fore, the attack plan recognition system should have the ca-
pability of dealing with partial order and unobserved activ-
ities.
In this paper, we develop a series of techniques to solve
three problems. First, we consider how to correlate isolated
attack scenarios derived from low-level alert correlation.
Second, we address how to recognize the attacker’s attack
plan and intentions. Third, we discuss how to make predic-
tions of potential attacks based on current observations and
analysis. In our approach, we apply graph techniques to cor-
relate isolated attack scenarios and identify their relation-
ship. Based on the high-level correlation results, we further
apply probabilistic reasoning technique to recognize the at-
tack plans, evaluate the likelihood of potential attack steps
and predict upcoming attacks.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 discusses the related work. In Section 3, we brieﬂy
introduce two alert correlation techniques upon which we
build our new techniques. Section 4 describes our correla-
tion models and attack prediction algorithm. We report our
experiment and results in Section 5. Section 6 concludes
this paper and discusses some future research directions.
2. Related Work
2.1. Alert Correlation
Recently, there have been several proposed approaches
to alert correlation and attack scenario analysis.
Valdes and Skinner [30] used probabilistic-based reason-
ing to correlate alerts by measuring and evaluating the sim-
ilarities of alert attributes. Alert aggregation and scenario
construction were conducted by enhancing or relaxing the
similarity requirements in some attribute ﬁelds. Goldman et
al. [16] built a correlation system based on Bayesian reason-
ing. The system predeﬁnes the relationship between mission
goals and corresponding security events. Further inference
and correlation rely on the predeﬁned association.
Porras et al. designed a “mission-impact-based” correla-
tion system [23] with focuses on the impact analysis based
on the mission goals of protected networks.
Debar and Wespi [14] applied backward and forward
reasoning techniques to correlate alerts with duplicates and
consequence relationships, and used clustering algorithms
to detect attack scenarios and situations.
Morin and Debar [20] applied chronicles formalism to
aggregate and correlate alerts. The approach is to perform
attack scenario pattern recognition based on known mali-
cious event sequences. Therefore, this approach is analo-
gous to misuse intrusion detection.
Ning et al. [21], Cuppens and Mi`ege [11] and Cheung
et al. [7] built alert correlation systems based on the pre-
conditions and post-conditions of individual alerts. The cor-
relation engine searches alert pairs that have a consequence
and prerequisite matching. Further correlation graphs can
be built with such alert pairs [21].
Qin and Lee [24] proposed a statistical-based alert cor-
relation approach to identifying new alert relationship with-
out depending on prior knowledge of attack transition pat-
terns.
2.2. Plan Recognition
In artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), plan recognition has been
an active research area. Different types of inference tech-
niques have been applied to plan recognition, e.g., deduc-
tion and abduction. In particular, the earliest work in plan
recognition was rule-based inference system [26, 31]. A
milestone work of plan recognition was done by Kautz and
Allen in 1986 [19]. In [19], they deﬁned the problem of
plan recognition as ﬁnding a minimal set of top-level ac-
tions, i.e., plan goals, that were sufﬁcient to explain the
observed actions. The inference was conducted by going
through the rule sets. Charniak and McDemott [6] proposed
that the plan recognition problem can be solved by abduc-
tion, or reasoning to the best explanation. Charniak and
Goldman [4, 5] applied Bayesian networks to plan recog-
nition. Carberry [3] applied Dempster-Shafer theory [28] to
compute the combined support by multiple evidences to hy-
potheses plans. Albrecht et al. [1] proposed to construct a
plan recognition inference system based on Dynamic Be-
lief Networks [13]. In Dynamic Belief Networks, the inﬂu-
ence of temporal aspects is represented by multiple nodes
to indicate the status of a variable at different instances of
time.
There are some challenges in applying traditional plan
recognition techniques to security applications. First, tra-
ditional plan recognition techniques are usually applied in
non-adversary situation. The recognition process can be ei-
ther aided or non-interfered by the agent being observed.
However, in the security application, the plan recognition
process is an adversary recognition where attackers are try-
ing to avoid or interfere with any recognition process on
their intrusion activities.
Second, the assumptions used in traditional plan recog-
nition are not valid in adversary recognition anymore. For
example, in non-adversary plan recognition, a single agent
and a single plan has to be determined. The observed activ-

ities are conducted by a single agent toward a single plan.
Although there are some works on ‘multi-agent’ plan recog-
nition, they also share this assumption. However, in attack
plan recognition, it is possible that an attacker has multi-
ple dynamic attack plans. There also exist coordinated at-
tacks conducted by multiple attackers. In addition, in non-
adversary plan recognition, there is a complete, ordered and
correct set of activities. The observations available are cor-
rect and corresponding to a determined plan. Every action
that is performed is observed. In adversary plan recogni-
tion, this assumption is not valid anymore.
The most related work to ours is [15] in which Geib and
Goldman applied probabilistic reasoning to recognize the
attacker’s intentions. The approach conducts the plan recog-
nition from raw security alerts. The plan library is deﬁned
by detailed speciﬁc attacks. This deﬁnition method has the
limitation that it can increase the computation complexity
of inference. In addition, it also requires a complete and or-
dered attack sequence (if there are missing attack steps, it
inserts hypothesized attack steps in order to have a com-
plete activity sequence) when conducting the plan recogni-
tion.
Our approach is unique in the following aspects. First,
we build our plan recognition system after a low-level alert
correlation step that includes alert aggregation, alert pri-
oritization and alert correlation. The advantage of this ap-
proach is that it can reduce the computation complexity
when performing the high-level attack scenario correlation
and probabilistic inference. Second, we do not require a
complete ordered alert sequence for inference. We have the
capability of handling partial order and unobserved activity
evidence sets. In practice, we cannot always observe all of
the attacker’s activities, and can often only detect partial or-
der of attack steps due to the limitation or deployment of
security sensors. For example, security sensors such as IDS
can miss detecting intrusions and thus result in an incom-
plete alert stream. Third, we provide an approach to pre-
dicting potential attacks based on observed intrusion evi-
dence.
3. Overview of Statistical and Probabilistic
Reasoning Techniques for Alert Correla-
tion
The new techniques of attack plan recognition and pre-
diction described in this paper are built on the alert correla-
tion approaches proposed in [24] and [25]. In this section,
we brieﬂy introduce our approaches of alert correlation.
The ﬁrst processing step is alert aggregation and clus-
tering. The goal if this step is to reduce the redundancy of
duplicated raw alerts corresponding to same attacks output
by heterogeneous security sensors. Alert aggregation is con-
ducted based on alert attributes such as time stamp, source
IP, destination IP, port(s), etc. Aggregated alerts with the
same attributes (except time stamps) are grouped into one
cluster. A hyper alert is deﬁned as a time ordered sequence
of alerts that belong to the same cluster.
The next step is alert prioritization that prioritizes each
hyper alert based on its relevance to the mission goals. With
the alert priority rank, security analyst can select important
alerts as the target alerts for further correlation and analy-
sis. Speciﬁcally, the priority score of an alert is computed
based on the relevance of the alert to the conﬁguration of
protected networks and hosts, as well as the severity of
the corresponding attack assessed by the security analyst.
When computing priority values, we compare the depen-
dencies of the corresponding attack represented by the hy-
per alert against the conﬁgurations of target networks and
hosts. We have a knowledge base in which each hyper alert
has been associated with a few ﬁelds that indicate its at-
tacking OS, services/ports and applications. The relevance
check downgrades the impacts of some alerts unrelated to
the protected domains on further correlation analysis, e.g.,
attackers “blindly” launch attacks against a target that has
no corresponding vulnerabilities.
We apply two techniques to alert correlation. First, we
use probabilistic-based reasoning method to correlate attack
steps that are directly related because an earlier attack en-
ables or positively affects the later one [25]. For example,
a port scan may be followed by a buffer overﬂow attack on
a scanned service port. We apply Bayesian-based correla-
tion mechanism to reason and correlate attack steps based
on security states of systems and networks. This approach
can incorporate prior knowledge of attack transition pat-
