ABSTRACT
With various IoT cameras today, sharing of their video evidences,
while benefiting the public, threatens the privacy of individuals
in the footage. However, protecting visual privacy without losing
video authenticity is challenging. The conventional post-process
blurring would open the door for posterior fabrication, whereas
the realtime blurring results in poor quality, low-frame-rate videos
due to the limited processing power of commodity cameras.
This paper presents Pinto, a software-based solution for produc-
ing privacy-protected, forgery-proof, and high-frame-rate videos
using low-end IoT cameras. Pinto records a realtime video stream at
a fast rate and allows post-processing for privacy protection prior
to sharing of videos while keeping their original, realtime signa-
tures valid even after the post blurring, guaranteeing no content
forgery since the time of their recording. Pinto is readily imple-
mentable in today’s commodity cameras. Our prototype on three
different embedded devices, each deployed in a specific application
context—on-site, vehicular, and aerial surveillance—demonstrates
the production of privacy-protected, forgery-proof videos with
frame rates of 17–24 fps, comparable to those of HD videos.

recording in a wide range of real-world applications today (Fig. 1),
from on-site security cameras to in-vehicle dashboard cameras (or
dashcams), and to aerial drone cameras. These cameras record every
event in their view, making their videos valuable evidence [6, 16, 18].
Further, a recent work has shown the feasibility of sharing video
evidences with network-enabled cameras [46, 69].
However, sharing of video evidences, even for the common good,
creates a significant threat to the privacy of individuals in the
footage. Many types of sensitive things, such as human faces, vehi-
cle license plates, and residential address signs, could be captured
in the footage. This has raised social concerns and ongoing debates
about visual privacy [28, 55, 58], making it a key barrier to video
sharing. For example, sharing or release of private surveillance
videos, despite the public benefit, is strongly discouraged or forbid-
den by law in some countries, such as Germany and Austria, due
to visual privacy concerns [9, 17].
Sharing video evidence for the common good while minimizing
its impact on privacy requires that: 1) videos have visual privacy
protection and the degree of visual privacy depend on the circum-
stances of requests; 2) videos be properly authenticated, e.g., time
of recording and data integrity; and 3) videos be of good quality.
In this work, we aim to develop a solution that fulfills these re-
quirements. The key challenge is that they are not isolated problems,
but intertwined with one another under two critical constraints—
limited device capabilities and content-oblivious hashing—rendering
existing solutions inadequate. The conventional post-processing
of videos to blur1 out contents [41, 56, 67] will nullify their orig-
inal signatures, i.e., unique hashes at the time of their recording
that are certified via trusted timestamping [22], opening the door
for posterior fabrication. Indeed, video forgery has become ex-
tremely simple with video editing software readily available today
[5, 33], which makes video evidence less reliable these days. On the

rather than the Gaussian blur in image processing.

blurred videos on the fly, is only possible with specialized hardware
[26, 31, 40, 50, 52, 54], and the quality of results highly depends
on the device capabilities. As reported in [11, 14], it produces poor
quality videos with frame rates at only 1–5 fps (frames per second)
when applied to low-end devices due to their limited processing
power.
This paper presents Pinto, a software-based solution for produc-
ing privacy-protected, forgery-proof, and high-quality videos using
low-end IoT cameras. Pinto leverages three key ideas. First, while
object detection on realtime video stream is expensive, pixelation
of a given frame area is computationally lightweight. By exploit-
ing such computational asymmetry, Pinto performs fast pixelation
of entire frames in real time while deferring the CPU-intensive
object detection until necessary for video sharing. Second, frame
division into subimage blocks allows fine-grained visual privacy on
each frame. Pinto uses the subimage block-level pixelation for both
realtime and post processing. Third, pixelation, when combined
with hashing, is also useful for forgery prevention. We devise hash-
pixelation (or h_pixelation) for this purpose, and use it in place of
the conventional pixelation. Pinto uses realtime signatures of fully
h_pixelated videos as proofs of their authenticity, such that poste-
rior fabrication would produce different h_pixelation results from
the original ones. Given a post h_pixelated video, the requester can
authenticate it by reconstructing the certified, fully h_pixelated
version via selective block h_pixelation.
Pinto has several merits: (i) the fast, lightweight realtime opera-
tion allows video recording at a high frame rate in low-end devices;
(ii) the CPU-intensive object detection is executed only when video
sharing is needed, saving the device power to do other things; (iii)
the post processing only permits pixelation for privacy protection
while prohibiting any other modification to original videos; (vi)
the post pixelation enables post-decision on visual privacy upon
request, flexibly determining the degree of visual privacy of stored
videos at the time of their release; (v) video processing is done at
the camera level, hence not requiring powerful back-end servers;
and (vi) it is a software-based solution immediately implementable
in today’s commodity IoT cameras.
We implement Pinto in three different embedded platforms (720
MHz–1.2 GHz CPUs), and deploy them to specific application con-
texts: on-site security cam, in-car dashcam, and aerial drone cam.
Our evaluations show that Pinto provides: (i) strong privacy pro-
tection (recognition success ratio < 1%) (ii) reliable authenticity
verification (forgery-proof guarantee) and (iii) good quality videos
(17–24 fps), comparable to those of HD videos.
2 BACKGROUND
Personalized video surveillance
Surveillance IoT cameras.
cameras have become commodity items, and now widely available
as low-cost devices ($30–$250 [4]). They have low-end processors
(700 MHz–1.2 GHz CPU), and come with 64–128 GB on-board SD
memory cards. These cameras continuously record in segments
for a unit-time (1-min default) and store them inside. Once the
memory is full, the oldest segment will be deleted and recorded
over. For example, with 128 GB cards, videos can be kept for 2–3
weeks internally. Many of these devices today feature a built-in

wireless network interface. Such IoT connectivity is for transmit-
ting realtime metadata on the fly and for occasionally archiving
certain videos in the cloud-based storage.
3 MOTIVATION
3.1 Use Cases
Personalized surveillance videos
Sharing surveillance videos.
are often useful to others who want to review their associated
events. There are emerging applications that share stored videos
taken by security cameras for suspicious activities [25, 27] or dash-
cams for car accidents [46], based on a time specified in the requests.
Data stores like Bolt [38] provide platforms for securely storing,
querying, and sharing IoT camera data, with data integrity guar-
anteed via timestamped signatures at the time of their recording.
However, sharing videos in their original form impacts the privacy
of individuals or bystanders in the footage. Pinto is an ideal com-
plement to these systems, making them support post-processing of
stored data for visual privacy protection, which was previously not
possible when guaranteeing data authenticity.
People are often willing to release

their video evidences to the press or social media, especially when
having captured unusual scenes such as disasters, traffic accidents,
crime scenes, etc. However, publication of footage captured by per-
sonal recording devices is strongly discouraged in some countries
even by law, due to visual privacy concerns. For example, individ-
uals who release dashcam footage could be subject to a fine [17]:
up to e300,000 in Germany, e25,000 in Austria, e10,000 in Portu-
gal, etc. Pinto offers a practical solution for releasing private video
evidence: the owners release post-blurred versions of the video
evidences with their original timestamped signatures still valid.
3.2 Threat Model
Visual privacy. We consider any entity with access to original
contents as an invader of visual privacy—except the recording de-
vices and their owners inevitably. For example, video requesters
are potential attackers. Given a processed video, the requester(s)
should not be able to access the original version. We assume a
strong adversary with powerful analytics capabilities, e.g., auto-
mated recognition and machine learning based tools to recognize
original, sensitive contents.
Processing of original videos is necessary for

(Fig. 2b). Such forgery can be done posteriorly with video editing
software available today [5], especially by dishonest owners to
