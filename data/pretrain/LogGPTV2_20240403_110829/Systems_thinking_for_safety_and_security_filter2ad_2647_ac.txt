if  controlled,  can  prevent  losses  to  numerous  threats  and 
disruptions.   
Additionally,  controlling  vulnerabilities  allows  security  analysts 
to prevent not only the disruptions from known threats, but also 
disruptions  introduced  by  unknown  threats.  In  other  words,  the 
source  of  the  disruption  does  not  matter.    What  matters  is 
identifying  and  controlling  the  vulnerability.    This  limits  the 
intelligence burden required to perform the initial system security 
analysis.    STPA-Sec  eventually  addresses  threats,  but  does  so 
much  later  in  the  analysis  process  after  generating  a  deeper 
systemic  understanding  of  the  context  under  which  the  threats 
may operate and the disruptions that actually lead to critical loss 
events. 
In  the  nuclear  power  plant  example,  Table  1  shows  high-level 
vulnerabilities  and  their  relation  to  four  identified  loss  events.  
The four loss events are: 
L1: Human Serious Injury or Loss of Life 
L2: Environmental Contamination 
L3: Significant Equipment Damage 
L4: Loss of Power Production to the Grid

V-2: Reactor temperature too high 
V-3: Equipment operated beyond limits 
V-4: Reactor shut down 
In  this  paper,  V-4  is  used  to  illustrate  how  STPA-Sec  identifies 
the potential vulnerable system states that can lead to the loss of 
power (L4).  The shutdown of the reactor is a specific state.  If the 
reactor  is  shutdown  and  if  other  worst-case  environmental 
conditions  are  present,  then  one  of  the  specific  loss  events  (L4) 
can result. The reactor shutdown represents a vulnerable state that 
can yield a specific system loss that security analysts must guard 
against.    However,  the  shutdown  of  the  reactor  may  NOT 
necessarily  lead  to  a  loss  of  power  production  to  the  grid.    For 
instance,  there  could  be  other  auxiliary  generators  that  could 
provide  a  small  amount  of  backup  power  for  a  limited  duration.  
Also,  the  reactor  shutdown  might  occur  during  a  time  when  the 
peak demand was low and capable of being met by other sources 
on the power grid.   
4
The potential causes of the reactor shutdown are not addressed at 
this point, that is done later in the process.  What is important is 
that the analysts identify the system’s vulnerable states and their 
relationship to the specific losses.  
There is another, more subtle consideration.  If defenders prevent 
a reactor shutdown, then L4 should not occur.  Reactor shutdown 
is the state that must be controlled by analysts (strategy).  This is 
different than trying to identify and counter all adversary actions 
or other potential disruptions (tactics).       
The causality model that underlies STPA-Sec is based on control 
and hierarchy.  Rather than attributing the loss to a single event or 
chain  of  events,  STPA-Sec  focuses  on  the  development  and 
maintenance  of  proper  controls  over  the  system  itself.    These 
controls take the form of constraints on system behavior.  In the 
example,  the  system  must  be  constrained  from  entering  the 
vulnerable states (V1 to V4 in Table 1). These constraints extend 
beyond traditional security constraints, such as access control, to 
include a much broader set of systemic concerns and issues. The 
High Level Control Structure monitors and enforces constraints. 
Creating a Model of the High Level Control Structure  
The  loss  model  underlying  STPA-Sec  is  based  on  a  lack  of 
constraints,  and  developing  the  High  Level  Control  Structure 
(HLCS)  model  provides  a  concise  graphical  specification  of  the 
functional  controls  in  the  system.    The  HLCS  modeling  is  both 
iterative and decomposable into smaller sub-elements.  Starting at 
a  high  level  allows  analysts  to  delve  deeper  where  necessary, 
while  simultaneously  maintaining  perspective  on  the  functional 
whole.  HLCS models include both control actions and feedback. 
The  HLCS  model  represents  not  only  the  technological,  but  the 
organizational sources of control.  As a result, it provides a wider 
perspective on the potential actions available to assist in securing 
operations  than  might  otherwise  be  available  through  other 
approaches. For space reasons, however, only the technical parts 
of  the  control  structure  are  included  in  the  nuclear  power  plant 
HLCS shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Simplified High Level Control Structure Model 
The  simplified  HLCS  model 
in  Figure  2  has  five  basic 
components.    The  first  component  is  the  operator.    In  this 
example,  the  operator  would  be  the  individual  charged  with 
monitoring the overall status of the power plant.  This individual 
would likely be located in a centralized control center.   
The  automated  Digital  Control  System  (DCS)  is  the  second 
component of the HLCS model.  The automation consists of the 
computer system that the operator uses to monitor the status of the 
actual  plant  and  issue  commands  necessary  to  ensure  safe 
operation  of  the  system  itself.  The  Digital  Control  System  is 
responsible for interpreting operator inputs and providing signals 
to  the  actuator.    In  the  example  used  here,  only  two  signals  are 
considered: open isolation valve and close isolation valve.   
An  actuator  is  the  third  component  and  resides  at  the  cyber-
physical  junction.    The  actuator  converts  signals  from  the 
computer  system  into  mechanical  activity  to  open  or  close  the 
physical  isolation  valve  to  the  cooling  system.    A  typical  plant 
would  consist  of  many  of  these  valves,  each  executing  different 
functions. 
The  physical  plant  is  the  fourth  component.    In  this  case,  the 
isolation  valve  being  controlled  resides  on  the  cooling  system 
itself.   
The fifth and final element of the example HLCS is the sensors.  
The sensors provide information to the control system about the 
actual condition of the plant.  This information could include data 
on whether or not an emergency (rupture) exists, but also includes 
more  obvious  information  such  as  the  condition  of  the  isolation 
valve (open or closed).    
Identifying Unsafe/Unsecure Control Actions 
The HLCS model combined with the other information in Step 1 
sets  the  foundation  for  the  remainder  of  the  STPA-Sec  analysis.  
Step  1  identified  loss  events,  the  vulnerabilities  that  can  lead  to 
these  losses  under  worst-case  environmental  conditions,  and  the 
HLCS  model  that  captures  the  control  information  that  is 
transmitted  throughout  the  system  in  order  to  allow  it  to 
accomplish its purpose.  Control information is depicted in Figure 
1  and  consists  of  both  control  actions  from  the  controller  to  the 
component  directing  and  prohibiting  specific  activity  and 
feedback from the component back to the controller on the status 
of the component.  Control information is not limited to data and 
signals.    Depending  on  the  part  of  the  control  structure  being 
considered,  it  can  include  regulations,  operating  procedures  and 
other  forms  of  guidance.    It  can  also  include  feedback  such  as 
status updates or After Action Reports.   
Regardless  of  format,  the  control  information  flows  throughout 
the hierarchical structure and regulates system performance. Some 
vulnerabilities  may  only  be  evident  if  the  connections  or 
interactions  between  the  various  sub-systems  are  examined.  For 
instance, a safety constraint in a train door controller may require 
that the door never be opened unless the train is at a station or an 
emergency exists. If a terrorist seeking to kill or injure individuals 
through  a  cyber  attack  is  able  to  attack  the  door  controller  by 
mimicking  the  “emergency”  state,  then  the  controller’s  logic 
might send the “open door” command and the train doors would 
open.  If this command was sent with a loaded train operating at 
full  speed,  it  is  easy  to  see  how  loss  of  life  or  damage  to  the 
system could occur.   
Note  that  the  vulnerability  is  not  in  the  controller  itself,  it  may 
perform exactly as the software engineer desired it to (sending the 
5
“open door” command in case of an emergency).  Unfortunately, a 
well-conceived and executed cyber attack in this example uses the 
controller’s logic to achieve a higher-level system loss of killing 
or injuring riders.  There is no security violation in the individual 
system  components.    The  vulnerability  lies  in  the  interactions 
between the components and only manifests under certain worst-
case conditions.   
The  simple  train  door  example  highlights  a  key  benefit  of  the 
approach, i.e., the focus on identifying and controlling vulnerable 
states  that  lead  to  systems-level  losses,  not  component  losses 
themselves.  Step 2 of STPA-Sec identifies which control actions 
are vulnerable and under what circumstances.  
As stated earlier, there are four types of potential unsafe/unsecure 
control actions:  
1.  Providing a control action leads to a hazard or exploits the 
vulnerability 
2.  Not providing a control action leads to a hazard or exploits a 
vulnerability 
3.  Providing control actions too late, too early, or in the wrong 
order leads to a hazard or exploits a vulnerability 
4.  Stopping a control action too soon or continuing it too long 
leads to a hazard or exploits a vulnerability. 
Determining  the  potential  causes  of  the  unsafe/unsecure  control 
actions is left to the next step. At this point, only the areas needing 
deep  dives  are  identified,  potentially  leading  to  a  more  efficient 
analysis process.  
Table 2 shows examples of each type of unsafe/unsecure control 
actions  related  to  vulnerabilities  from  Table  1  in  the  nuclear 
power plant example.
