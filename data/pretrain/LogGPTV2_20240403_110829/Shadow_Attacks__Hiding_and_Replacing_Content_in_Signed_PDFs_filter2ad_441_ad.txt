### Digital Signature Vulnerabilities in PDF Viewing Applications

#### A. Methodology
In Adobe Acrobat, the signing system is the only component that holds the private key for digital signatures. To conduct our experiments, we utilized the Apache PDFBox library, Adobe Acrobat Pro 2017, and PDF-Attacker. We developed eight different exploits covering all attack variants and evaluated their effectiveness across various viewing programs on the victims' systems.

#### B. Applications
We included PDF viewing applications capable of correctly processing signed PDF documents. In total, we identified 29 such applications across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. The following table summarizes the tested applications, their versions, and their vulnerability status:

| Soda PDF Desktop | 11.1.09.4184 64-bit | Vulnerable | - | - | - | - | - |

**Key:**
- **Not vulnerable**: The application is not susceptible to the attack.
- **Vulnerable**: The application is susceptible to the attack.
- **Limited vulnerability**: The application always throws a warning, even for legitimate modifications.
- **Fixed**: The vulnerabilities have been addressed by the vendor.

#### C. Results
Out of the 29 tested PDF viewing applications, 16 were found to be vulnerable to at least one of the presented attacks. For 12 of these applications, all three attack classes (Hide, Replace, and Hide-and-Replace) were successful. Some applications exhibited limited vulnerabilities, where a warning was always thrown, regardless of whether the modification was legitimate or malicious.

**a) Differences in Operating Systems:**
While no significant differences were observed between the Windows and macOS versions of Adobe products, notable discrepancies were found in the signature validation of Master PDF Editor, PDF Editor 6 Pro, and PDFelement. On macOS, these applications consistently displayed a warning that the signature was invalid whenever an Incremental Update was detected. Conversely, on Windows, the viewers indicated that the signature was valid but sometimes warned of changes. This difference can be attributed to the varying validation messages and the different versions of the applications on each operating system.

**b) Hide Shadow Attack:**
The Hide shadow attack class was successful against 12 PDF viewing applications. The exploit involved re-declaring the overlay image file as `/Subtype/XML/Type/Metadata` with `/Subtype/Image/Type/XObject` using Incremental Updates. The Adobe Acrobat applications faded out the image file but still confirmed a valid signature in UI-Layers 1 and 2. A manual signature check returned error code 109, but the signature status remained unaffected.

**c) Replace Shadow Attack:**
A total of 16 PDF viewing applications were vulnerable to the Replace shadow attack class, which had two variants: replace via overlay and replace via overwrite. While Adobe viewers correctly classified font exchanges as unauthorized Incremental Updates, the signature remained valid when form field text was changed. Conversely, PDF Editor 6 Pro and PDFelement marked the signature as invalid when field content was exchanged, despite successfully manipulating the fonts. The Foxit Reader's behavior changed after an update from version 9.5.0.20723 to 9.7.0.29455, allowing font exchanges without invalidating the signature. LibreOffice Draw, which ignores embedded fonts, was immune to this type of attack but allowed field text changes without invalidating the signature.

**d) Hide-and-Replace Shadow Attack:**
The Hide-and-Replace shadow attack was successful against 16 PDF viewing applications. The Adobe viewing applications displayed the hidden content while showing the signature as valid in UI-Layers 1 and 2. A manual signature check revealed an invalid node within the page structure data, but the signature status remained unaffected.

**e) Responsible Disclosure:**
Based on the evaluation results, we initiated the responsible disclosure process for 26 vulnerable applicationsâ€”16 fully vulnerable and 10 with limited vulnerabilities. We collaborated with CERT-Bund (BSI) to create a dedicated vulnerability report and contact all affected vendors and related organizations. Several vendors, including Adobe, Foxit, LibreOffice, Power PDF, and Soda PDF, responded promptly and implemented fixes. Other vendors, such as Master PDF, Nitro, PDF Architect, PDF-XChange, and Power PDF, acknowledged the report but provided no feedback on patches. In four cases, we received no response despite multiple attempts.

This comprehensive evaluation highlights the need for continued vigilance and robust security measures in PDF viewing applications to protect against digital signature vulnerabilities.
