Using
    pmap(sqrt,[-1]); "some other return val"
hides the error to be displayed to stdout.
This also partially applied to warnings, but I couldn't find a simple way to
reproduce it (`pmap(warn,["warning"])` actually shows the warning, but nested
warnings in my real life code actually don't get displayed).
