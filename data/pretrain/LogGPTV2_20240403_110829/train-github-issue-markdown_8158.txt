It would be great to implement some simple mouse improvements for multi-
monitor setups.
I have 2 monitors with different resolutions. When moving the mouse from one
monitor to another, it can get "stuck" on corners where the monitors (which
appear to the system as being of different "sizes") don't align. Adjusting for
resolution to let the mouse travel from the upper-left corner of one monitor
to the upper-right corner of the next (and lower-left to lower-right) would
make my setup much easier to use.
The open source app LittleBigMouse does this pretty well, but the
configuration is very slow and it is somewhat flaky on startup. It also
appears to be abandoned. I don't know anything about the source, but at least
you can see what it does and try it out to see if you think it improves the
standard Windows mouse handling.
I think this type of functionality would fit in well with the PowerToys
portfolio.
