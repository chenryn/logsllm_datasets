It would be beneficial to implement some simple mouse improvements for multi-monitor setups, especially for users with monitors of different resolutions. When moving the mouse between monitors, it can sometimes get "stuck" at the corners where the monitors, which appear to the system as being of different "sizes," do not align properly. Adjusting the mouse movement to account for resolution differences—allowing the mouse to seamlessly travel from the upper-left corner of one monitor to the upper-right corner of the next (and similarly from the lower-left to the lower-right)—would significantly enhance the user experience.

The open-source application LittleBigMouse addresses this issue quite effectively; however, its configuration process is rather slow, and it can be unstable during startup. Additionally, it appears that the project has been abandoned, which raises concerns about future support and updates. Although I am not familiar with the source code, you can still evaluate the application to see if it improves upon the standard Windows mouse handling.

I believe that this type of functionality would be a valuable addition to the PowerToys portfolio, providing a more polished and user-friendly experience for those with multi-monitor setups.
