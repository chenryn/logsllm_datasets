Next, you must open the cid.sh file within your Documents/scripts folder and modify the content. You mu*t 
provide your own API keys issued by any services which you wish to search. Replace any instance of "XXXX" 
within the script with your own API keys, as previously explained. When you execute the script, which should 
now be in your "Activities" menu labeled as "CallerID Tool", you should receive the following menu.
Enter the number associated with the service you desire, then enter the target telephone number when 
prompted. The results will appear within your Terminal session. After each query, you can make another 
selection if you want to move to another service. As a reminder, you must replace each occurrence of "XXXX" 
within my script with your actual license keys or credentials if you want to use this technique. Below is the script
There are many caller ID options available on the internet and I encourage you to investigate any companies 
which have surfaced since this research. Most services offer a free trial, even if it is not advertised. Adding a few 
dollars to each service may provide more queries than you will ever need. Take advantage of the free trials to 
determine which services work best in your investigations. In 2021, 1 ranked the following in terms of most 
useful to least.

#1) Twilio: This was the most reliable and identified name and carrier consistently.
#2) Telnyx: The results here were very similar to Twilio with a few unique records.
#3) Caller ID Service: This legacy sendee often presents outdated information, which can also be valuable.

In 2019,1 purchased premium memberships through these services. A $10 purchase provided over 1,000 queries 
at each provider, and 1 still have credits today. 1 updated my API keys within my custom script, which I rely on 
every day. Spending a few minutes modifying your own script within your Linux VM will pay off ten-fold within 
the first week. 1 often avoid all telephone search websites when I can quickly identify' a number's owner without 
opening a browser.
Overall, reverse caller ID sendees can tell us more about a target telephone number than the standard people 
search engines. In many cases, you can immediately obtain data that would have required a subpoena just a few 
years prior. Always utilize all of the sendees in order to gauge the confidence in the results. If this is overkill for 
your needs, there are other web-based search engines that are easier to use. At the end of the chapter, 1 present 
my custom search tools which should help automate many of these queries.
This sendee possesses data similar to the premium caller ID products, but is completely free and available 
through a traditional website. The results are not as comprehensive as the previous options, but could be valuable 
if you have no caller ID accounts created.
You would replace "XXXX" with your API key and "6184620000" with your target telephone number. Similar 
to the usage with email addresses, this query is powerful. I conducted a query for the cellular telephone number 
4155688415. The full results would require several pages, but I will focus on the most desired date, as follows.
If you acquired an API key from People Data Labs during the email chapter, you can use this key to query 
telephone numbers. This is not a true caller ID sendee, so I did not include it within the previous script 
However, you could add it if you find the service useful. First, let's take a look at the following URL structure.

This service stands alone as the most creative telephone number lookup service. True Caller is an app for smart 
devices that displays caller ID information of incoming calls. If you receive a call on your phone, and the number 
is not in your contacts, True Caller searches its database and provides any results on your screen. You can then 
choose to accept or deny the call. This is fairly standard and is not the interesting aspect of this service. The 
fascinating part to me is the source of their caller database. It is mostly crowd-sourced.
This site was designed to input a telephone number and test the Caller ID display feature. It is nothing more 
than a standard lookup sendee, but I have found the data to be unique from other sources on some occasions. 
Unfortunately, I have also found the availability of this sendee to be completely unreliable. While the site is 
usually present, the results don't always populate. However, this resource should be checked as a last resort when 
the other processes have failed.
This is the only service which has reliably presented Facebook profile data from a telephone number query. 
Hopefully, they will continue to offer their free trial which allows 1,000 lookups without expiration. I added this 
option within the custom search tools under the caller ID section. Similar to those, you must add your API key 
to the source code of the page in order for it to function.
In previous editions of this book, I summarized a handful of people search websites which allowed the query of 
a telephone number. These sites all possess unique data sets and each should be searched. Most of the results 
originate from sources such as property tax data, marketing leaks, phonebooks, and various data breaches. 
Instead of explaining each site, which becomes quite redundant, I will display the static URL of a search 
submission. Many of these links avoid unnecessary loading screens and advertisements. This will help us with 
the automated tool at the end. Overall, we cannot control the results, and telephone search is mostly "what you 
see is what you get". Replace the demo number (618-462-0000) with your target number.
When you install the app, you give it permission to collect all of your contacts and upload them to the original 
database. Basically, millions of users have uploaded their contact lists for the world to see. The next amazing 
thing to me is the ability to search within this data on the True Caller website. You must connect to the service 
via a covert Microsoft or Google account, but that is not difficult. When I first found this service, I was skeptical. 
I entered the cellular number of my government issued cellular telephone expecting to see no results. The 
response was "Mike Bazell". My jaw dropped. My super-secret number was visible to the world. This means that 
someone in my circle, likely another government employee, installed True Caller on his or her phone and had 
my information in their contacts. Until someone else populates data for this number, it will always be present in 
the database.
This service offers a typical telephone number search tool, which also appears to extract data from crowd­
sourced databases. I suspect that much of this data was acquired many years ago, but this can still be beneficial. 
Sometimes, I want historical data about a number, even if it is no longer issued to the target.
Real World Application: During my final year of government investigations, I queried a target number 
associated with a homicide through this service. The result was "Drug Dealer Matt". One of the target's 
customers must have installed True Caller. One of three potential suspects was named Matt, who earned our 
spodight, and later an arrest.

Google and Bing were once a great place to find basic information about a target phone number. These sites 
can still provide valuable information, but the amount of spam that will display in the results is overwhelming. 
Many of the links presented will link to sites that will charge a fee for any information associated. This 
information is usually the same content that could have been located with an appropriate free search. I do not 
recommend giving in to these traps. While we can't ignore a traditional search of telephone numbers, we can 
customize the queries in order to achieve the best results. Before explaining advanced telephone owner 
identification, we should take a look at appropriate search engine structure.
Most people use traditional search engines as a first step toward identifying the owner of a telephone number. 
The number is usually provided in a standard format such as 202-555-1212. This can confuse some search 
engines because a hyphen (-) is often recognized as an operator to exclude data. Some engines might view that 
query as a search for 202 but not 555 or 1212. Additionally, this search might identify a website that possesses 
202-555-1212 within the content but not one that contains (202) 555.1212. If this is your target number, all of 
the following should be searched in order to exhaust all possibilities. The quotation marks are important to 
prevent the hyphen from being seen as an operator.
contact information. While not a complete list of options, the following should also be searched.
"2025551212"OR"202-555-1212"OR"202.555.1212"OR"202 555 1212"

This may seem ridiculous, but I am not done. Many websites forbid users to post a telephone number, such as 
many auction sites, but people tty to trick this restriction. They will type out a portion of their number to disclose
Sly Dial does not usually ring the suspect's telephone. It will likely not show "missed call" or any other indicator 
that a call occurred. In my testing, less that 5 percent of the attempts actually cause the target telephone to ring 
only one time. Calling the missed call back reveals nothing about the identity of the number. Ultimately, there 
is a very small chance that the target will know that someone attempted a call. In the rare occurrence that the 
telephone rings, the target will never know the identity of the person making the calls. To use the Sly Dial service, 
call 267-759-3425 (267-SLYDIAL) from any telephone service including landlines, cellular lines, or VOIP. 
Follow the directions during the call. If this number does not work, visit slydial.com for updates. 1 want to stress 
the following one additional time. Use these services at your own risk. If accidentally notifying your target that 
you are conducting these types of activities could compromise your investigation, avoid this technique.
This list would not capture a post that included (202) 555 twelve twelve, but you get the point After submitting 
these through Google, you should attempt each through Bing. In my effort to always provide search tools which 
automate and simplify these techniques, I have added this feature to your telephone tools presented at the end 
of the chapter. The right-middle portion of this page, displayed later in Figure 18.03, allows you to enter a 
numerical and written target telephone number. Clicking the submit button launches a series of JavaScript 
commands that launch eight new tabs within your browser. The first four are custom Google searches with the 
target data and the last four repeat the process on Bing. The following four searches are conducted on both 
services, using the example data entered previously.
This service contacts the cellular provider of the target telephone number and sends you straight to the outgoing 
voicemail message. This can allow you to hear their voice and name without ringing the phone and hoping they 
do not pick up. Sly Dial does not work through a website and you do not need to create an account to use the 
service. Instead, you must call a general Sly Dial telephone number and follow the automated prompts. You 
must listen to a brief advertisement before your call is placed. Finally, the service will play the target's outgoing 
voicemail message through this audible telephone call. Since a website is not involved, there is no option to 
download an audio file of the call.
Notice that these queries use quotation marks to obtain exact results and the OR operator to search multiple 
options independently from each other. You will likely receive many false positives with this method, but you 
are less likely to miss any relevant results. While this is a great starting point for number searches, it is much less 
reliable than the next method.

Craigslist has already been discussed in earlier chapters, but the phone search options should be further detailed. 
Many people use Craigslist to sell items or services. The posts that announce the item or service available will 
often include a telephone number. These numbers will belong to a landline or cellular provider. This < 
great way to identify unknown telephone numbers. Some posts on Craigslist will not allow a telephone 
to be displayed on a post. It is a violation of the rules on certain types of posts. Some people choose not to list 
a number because of automated "scrapers" that wall grab the number and add it to databases to receive spam 
via text messages. Either way, the solution that most users apply to bypass this hindrance is to spell out the 
phone number. Instead of typing "314-555-1212", the user may enter "three one 
two". Some will get creative and post "314 five five five 1212". This is enough to
1 first noticed this niche sendee in late 2018. It provides historical WHiite Pages landline listings from 1994-2014. 
The sources are official databases collected from many years of telephone CD-ROMs. These were purchased 
by various companies throughout several decades as a more convenient option than traditional phone books. 
The data is quite impressive, and the following direct URLs allow us to add these to our tools. Results include 
historic addresses attached to each year. Figure 18.01 displays an actual redacted result from the official website.
