# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
Two entries and common chunk (see the linked repo for more details):
  * index1 - imports dep1 which imports dep2. actually uses both of them
  * index2 - imports dep1 but only uses a function that does not depend on dep2
  * commons - contains everything that is used by more than one entry
The issue is that dep2 is detected only as required only for index1 (since
index2 does not actually use it). By itself that is kind of fine - when
loading commons+index1, everything works, because dep2 is loaded from index1
chunk.
However when loading index2, fails with runtime error due to the fact that in
commons chunk, dep1 still lists dep2 as dependency - but it is not included in
either commons or index2.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**

**What is the expected behavior?**
no runtime errors (either dep2 is included in commons chunk or it is loaded
only when calling the function that uses it or various other combinations of
moving/splitting the modules so that it works for both entries)
