Question: "An adversary is attempting to compromise the security of an Apple device. They are considering various attack vectors based on the understanding of certain security mechanisms described in the text. Which of the following statements represent incorrect assumptions or misunderstandings about the security features?"
 "A": "Mounting a sophisticated physical attack on the processor's silicon could potentially reveal the unique ID (UID) used in cryptographic operations."
 "B": "The tangling process, using the device's UID, allows for brute-force attacks to be performed in parallel on multiple devices."
 "C": "Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) makes exploitation more challenging by ensuring memory addresses are unpredictable."
 "D": "AES-XTS is a mode of AES used for encrypting communication channels rather than storage media."
