A ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The ethical case for the UDP reflection honeypots operated
by the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre is described in Thomas
et al. [61] and summarised below.
Reflecting UDP packets could assist criminals in perform-
ing DoS attacks. However the hopscotch reflector limits the
number of packets it reflects to any IP address. It attempts
to only reflect to the criminals’ scanners (so that they use the
honeypots) but not (at any scale) to victims. Furthermore,
when any hopscotch sensor identifies a victim this is reported
to a central server which informs all the other sensors of the
attack, so that they all refuse to reflect any packets at all to
the victim.
The result is that if the hopscotch sensors are used for
illegal attacks then after a very short period there will be
rather less traffic delivered to the victim than if the sensors
did not exist, because some of the attack traffic generated
by the criminal is being absorbed by the sensors rather than
going to real reflectors and being reflected and amplified.
‘White-hat’ scanners identify reflectors and report them to
the relevant ISP or hosting company who will then contact
the owner of the machine. The hopscotch sensors do not reply
to identified ‘white-hat’ scanners, or to known researchers,
in order to avoid wasting their time or affecting their results.
Data on self-reported attacks by booters was collected by
logging in to the booter websites as a visitor. No data was
collected that required buying a subscription or requesting
an attack before data would be displayed.
Both datasets can be obtained by academic researchers
from the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre so that other re-
searchers can fully reproduce or build upon our results.
https://www.cambridgecybercrime.uk/process.html
In line with previous research in this space, we have not
published the identity of any booters which are still opera-
tional at the time of publication.
The ethical issues in the use of leaked or seized booter
databases to support our results is discussed by Thomas et
al. [61] and put in a broader context in a later paper on the
use of leaked data for research [62]. Only the attack logs were
analysed for this paper.
We followed our institution’s ethical review procedure
throughout. We carefully designed our experiments to op-
erate ethically and we had no human subjects. Our related
qualitative research which supported this work was approved
by our ethics committee (#621).
