Question: A development team is designing a new embedded system that includes various components connected via a system bus. To comply with secure design principles, the team is considering the configuration of the bus-control-enable bit in the fabric end-point registers. Which of the following outcomes are likely if the bus-control-enable bit is set to 1 by default for all responder devices?
"A": "Responder devices would be restricted from initiating transactions, enhancing system security.",
"B": "Responder devices could potentially control bus transactions, leading to security vulnerabilities.",
"C": "The system would be more flexible, allowing any device to initiate transactions as needed.",
"D": "System boot time would be reduced, as no additional firmware checks would be needed for bus-control settings."
Answer: B
