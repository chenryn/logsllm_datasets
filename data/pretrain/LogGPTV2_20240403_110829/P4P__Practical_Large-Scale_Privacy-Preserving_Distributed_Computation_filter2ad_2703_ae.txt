### Protection and Server Work Division

Protection is essential in this context. The work of each server can be divided into two primary components: processing client requests and communicating with other servers. The most resource-intensive interactions are those with clients, which include verifying zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and other tasks. These operations can be performed on a single server and are independent of the security parameter \( \kappa \). The inter-server communication, on the other hand, is primarily for data exchange and does not involve complex computations.

### Data Exchange Among Servers

Data exchange among servers serves two main purposes:
1. **Reconstructing Shared Secrets**: This is necessary at the end of each iteration to compute the final sum and during the verification of commitments.
2. **Reaching Agreement on User Status**: Each server must verify that a user has correctly computed their share of the commitments.

Since each server is assumed to be semi-honest, they only need to pass the final verification results. The ZKP verification can be done on just one server.

### Constructing the Final Sum

For constructing the final sum, all servers must send their shares to the server hosting ARPACK. The receiving server will get a total of \( 8\kappa m \) bytes (assuming double-precision encoding), which is approximately \( 8\kappa \) MB if \( m = 10^6 \).

### Consistency Check

During each iteration, one server is designated as the "master." All other servers send their shares of the commitments to the master. This includes \( 3n \) large integers in \( \mathbb{Z}_q \) (3 for each user) from each server. Additionally, each non-master server sends an \( n \)-bit bitmap to the master, indicating whether each user has correctly computed the commitments.

The master then reconstructs the complete commitments and verifies the ZKPs. It broadcasts an \( n \)-bit bitmap to all other servers, indicating whether each user has passed the consistency check.

### Communication Costs

- **Master Server**:
  - Receiving: \( 3n(\kappa - 1) \) integers in \( \mathbb{Z}_q \) and \( \kappa n \)-bit strings.
  - Sending: \( (\kappa - 1)n \) bits.
  - For \( n = 10^6 \) and \( |q| = 1024 \), these amounts to approximately \( 384(\kappa - 1) \) MB and \( 0.1(\kappa - 1) \) MB, respectively.

- **Non-Master Servers**:
  - Sending: Approximately 384 MB.
  - Receiving: Approximately 0.1 MB.

These costs are practical for small values of \( \kappa \) (e.g., 3 or 4). The master role can be rotated among the servers to distribute the load.

### Computation Costs

The master needs to perform \( 3n(\kappa - 1) \) multiplications in \( \mathbb{Z}_q^* \). Using our benchmarks, this amounts to approximately \( 0.186(\kappa - 1) \) seconds for \( n = 10^6 \) users. This is also practical for small \( \kappa \). Other servers do not need to perform any additional work.

### Scalability

We have tested our system with very large matrices, ranging from tens of thousands to over a hundred million dimensions. These matrices are used for latent semantic analysis. To facilitate the tests, we excluded the data verification ZKPs, as our previous benchmarks show they contribute insignificantly to the overall cost. Due to space and resource limitations, we did not test how performance varies with dimensionality and other parameters. Instead, these results demonstrate the system's capability to handle large datasets efficiently while maintaining privacy.

### Experimental Results

Table 3 summarizes some of the results. The running time measures the time from the start of the job until the results are safely written to disk. It includes both the computation time of the server (including the time spent invoking the ARPACK engine) and the clients (running in parallel), as well as the communication time.

- **Frontend Processors**: These machines interact directly with users. Large-scale systems typically use multiple frontend machines, each serving a subset of users. This approach also parallelizes the aggregation process, where each frontend machine aggregates data from a subset of users before forwarding it to the server.
- **Optimal Configuration**: The optimal solution must balance the number of frontend processors and the server's communication cost. Due to resource limitations, we were not able to use the optimal configuration for all tests, but the results are still feasible even in sub-optimal cases.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we present a new framework for privacy-preserving distributed data mining. Our protocol is based on secret sharing over small fields, achieving significant reductions in running time compared to alternative solutions with large-scale data. The framework also includes efficient zero-knowledge tools for verifying user data, providing practical solutions for handling cheating users. P4P demonstrates that cryptographic building blocks can work harmoniously with existing tools, providing privacy without degrading efficiency. Most components described in this paper have been implemented, and the source code is available at [http://bid.berkeley.edu/projects/p4p/](http://bid.berkeley.edu/projects/p4p/). Our goal is to make it a useful tool for developers in data mining and others to build privacy-preserving real-world applications.

### Notes

1. Most mining algorithms require bounding the amount of noise in the data to produce meaningful results. This means that the fraction of cheating users is usually below a much lower threshold (e.g., \( \alpha < 20\% \)).
