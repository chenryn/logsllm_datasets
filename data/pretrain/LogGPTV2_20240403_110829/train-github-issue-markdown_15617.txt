Hi, I recently opened an issue here atom/tabs#148 , claiming I couldn't drag
tabs around to rearrange them, but realized it's a more general problem. I
can't left-click and drag ANYTHING in Atom. I can't even left mouse down and
drag to highlight text. It's as if the mouse up event is firing when it
shouldn't.
I'm using a fresh install of  
Atom 0.204.0  
on Linux Mint 17 Qiana (based on Ubuntu 14.04, Trusty Tahr)
Thanks!
