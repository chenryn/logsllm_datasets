User:  According to the following description, design a reliable network topology to ensure system stability and data security. Our company needed a global, enterprise-grade network infrastructure. The system needs to support a large amount of traffic and access, and provide reliable data security guarantees. We need load balancing and failover across multiple data centers to ensure high availability and continuous uptime of the system. In addition, our system needs to meet relevant information security standards such as PCI-DSS.
Assistant: In view of the above requirements, it is recommended to adopt a distributed three-layer network topology: The first layer: the boundary layer, responsible for communication with the outside world and data security. It is recommended to use security devices such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and DDoS attack prevention to isolate internal and external networks. Boundary layer devices in multiple data centers can be interconnected to form a cluster for load balancing and failover. At the same time, the boundary layer can also combine traffic and forward it to the aggregation layer of the next layer. The second layer: the aggregation layer, which is responsible for connecting the boundary layer and the core layer, and converging and distributing traffic. Devices such as load balancers and routers are recommended for traffic distribution and failover. Aggregation layer devices in multiple data centers can be connected to each other to form a cluster to achieve load balancing and fault tolerance. The third layer: the core layer, which is responsible for carrying the main traffic and services of the entire network. It is recommended to use high-bandwidth switches and routers to support a large amount of traffic and access. At the same time, virtualization technology can be used to virtualize multiple core layer devices into a logical entity to achieve load balancing and reliability. Protocols such as VRRP can be used between core layer devices to achieve failover and fault tolerance. Through this three-tier distributed network topology, large-scale traffic and access can be realized, and the reliability and security of the system can be guaranteed. At the same time, it can also meet relevant information security standards such as PCI-DSS. But it should be noted that building such a network infrastructure requires professional technical support and high-quality equipment.
