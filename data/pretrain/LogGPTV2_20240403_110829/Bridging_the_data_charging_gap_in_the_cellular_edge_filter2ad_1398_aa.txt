## Abstract

### Intelligent Cellular Edge
- **Low-latency service:** Available anywhere, anytime.
- **Powered by 4G/5G cellular networks.**
- **Active standardization and early adoption.**

### Cellular Edge Infrastructure
- **Edge Devices**
- **Base Stations**
- **Core Network**
- **Edge Servers**
- **4G/5G Gateways**
- **Charging Function**
- **Charging Data Records**

### The Data Charging Gap: What and Why
- **Cost of Cellular Traffic:** Edge applications pay 4G/5G operators based on data usage.
- **Data Charging Gap:** Discrepancies between the operator and edge application vendor regarding the amount of data to be charged.
- **Causes of the Gap:**
  - Data loss due to intermittent wireless connections, mobility, congestion, SLA violations, and other factors.

### Our Solution: Trusted, Loss-tolerant Charging (TLC)
- **Negotiation-Based Charging:** Allows the edge application vendor and 4G/5G operator to negotiate the charging data volume.
- **Loss-Selfishness Cancellation:** A game-theoretical approach to balance out selfishness and loss-induced gaps.
- **Proof-of-Charging (PoC):** Digitally signed for mutual trust.

### Key Properties of TLC
- **Correctness:** Ensures a bounded charging gap, with no gap if both parties are rational.
- **Latency Friendliness:** Does not block delay-sensitive edge traffic.
- **Public Verifiability:** Any independent third party (e.g., FCC or court) can verify the charging.

### Performance Evaluation
- **Gap Reduction:**
  - 80.2% in WebCam
  - 87.5% in edge-based VR
  - 47.06% in online gaming
- **Marginal Overhead:** Negligible extra data latency and signaling message overhead.
- **Scalability:** A single HP Z840 workstation can verify 230,000 PoCs per hour.

### Figures and Tables
- **Figure 5: TLC Overview**
- **Figure 6: TLC Intuition**
- **Table 1: Notations in TLC**

### Notations
- **c ∈ [0, 1]:** Predefined charging weight for lost data.
- **T = (Tstart, Tend):** Charging cycle in the data plan.
- **ˆxe, ˆxo:** Ground truth of edge-sent and network-received usage.
- **ˆx:** Ground truth of the usage to be charged.
- **x:** Negotiated usage in TLC.
- **K+e, K-e:** Edge application vendor’s public/private key pair.
- **K+o, K-o:** Cellular operator’s public/private key pair.
- **ne, no:** Nonces from the edge and operator.
- **se, so:** Message sequence numbers from the edge and operator.

### Workflow
1. **Data Transfer**
2. **Charging Data Record**
3. **Loss-Selfishness Cancellation**
4. **Proof of Charging**
5. **Verification**

### Additional Metrics
