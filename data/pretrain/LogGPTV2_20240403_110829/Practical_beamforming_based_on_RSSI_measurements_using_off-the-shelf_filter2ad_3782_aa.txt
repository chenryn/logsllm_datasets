ABSTRACT
WLANs have become an important last-mile technology for pro-
viding internet access within homes and enterprises. In such indoor
deployments, the wireless channel suffers from signiﬁcant multi-
path scattering and fading that degrades performance. Beamform-
ing is a smart antenna technology that adjusts the transmissions at
the transmitter to reenforce the signals received through multiple
paths at the receiver. However, doing this requires the accurate
estimation of the channel coefﬁcients at the receiver and its knowl-
edge at the transmitter which off-the-shelf WiFi clients are inca-
pable of doing. In this work, we develop a novel procedure that
uses Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements at
the receiver along with an intelligent estimation methodology at the
transmitter to achieve beamforming beneﬁts. Using experiments in
an indoor ofﬁce scenario with commercial WiFi clients, we show
that the scheme achieves signiﬁcant performance improvements
across diverse scenarios.

INTRODUCTION
Indoor wireless networks operating in the 2.4 - 5 GHz spectrum
have become popular last mile internet access networks using stan-
dards such as IEEE 802.11, WiMAX, etc. However, these networks
are plagued by multipath scattering and fading [1] that severely un-
dermine their performance. This is particularly signiﬁcant in the
context of high-bandwidth applications such as IPTV and home
video distribution [2, 3]. Most works have focused on improving

the link performance by coping with multipath through link layer
mechanisms such as forward error correction codes, using multi-
ple transmissions or using partially correct packets [4, 5, 6] while
using a single antenna with an omni-directional radiation pattern
(Omni). Smart antennas have emerged as an effective means to
directly combat the negative effects of multipath propagation. To
mitigate the effect of fading, multiple transmit antenna elements to-
gether with appropriate signal processing can be used to a) increase
the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and b) decrease error rate, at the
receiver [1]. The ability to modify the transmitted signal in a way
that signal components get reinforced by the multipath channel has
led to the popularity of smart antennas and their adoption in several
standards [7, 8, 9, 10]. More recently, several experimental works
have started investigating the practical beneﬁts of these smart an-
tennas in indoor and outdoor wireless networks and are reporting
promising results [11, 12, 13].
There are three main classes of smart antenna technologies, de-
pending on the sophistication of signal processing at the transmit-
ter (Tx) and receiver (Rx), namely Multiple Input Multiple Output
(MIMO), Directional antennas and Beamforming antennas. MIMO
is a popular strategy that uses multiple antenna elements at the Tx
and Rx and leverages the rich scattering nature of the environment
and the knowledge of the channel at the Rx, to increase the link ca-
pacity [1]. Directional antennas are used predominantly in outdoor
scenarios and their transmission pattern is pre-set to point a main
lobe (providing high gain) in the direction of the Rx [1]. Such a
radiation pattern is obtained by applying a ﬁxed set of phases to the
signal transmitted from each antenna at the Tx. Most of the cur-
rent works on smart antennas [12, 14, 15] fall under this category.
Since the transmit pattern is oblivious to channel state information,
directional beams are affected by multipath propagation and have
been shown to be less effective in indoor environments [11, 16].
In contrast, Beamforming is a closed-loop technique that uses
the channel information at the Tx to modify the transmitted signal
such that the signals received through the multiple paths are rein-
forced at the Rx thereby improving the link Signal to Noise Ratio
(SNR). Consequently, the resulting beam pattern may not have the
single main lobe structure (pointing in the direction of the Rx) of
a directional antenna but results in better performance in multipath
rich environments. Our recent measurements in a real indoor of-
ﬁce environment have shown that beamforming can yield an av-
erage of 6.5 dB (and maximum of 12 dB) of SNR improvement
when compared to directional antennas [16]. These signal qual-
ity improvements can be used to signiﬁcantly improve the datarate
of the link. For instance, consider a link whose receive SNR is 8
dB when the Tx forms a directional beam to the Rx using an ar-
ray of eight antenna elements. For this SNR, an 802.11g link can
support a datarate of 9 Mbps [17]. On the other hand, when us-
410ing beamforming, the additional SNR gain of 6 dB [16] results in
a datarate of 18 Mbps (yielding a 2X rate improvement compared
to directional). Thus, the importance of beamforming over direc-
tional beam is clear. Unlike other MIMO techniques, beamforming
does not require multiple elements at the clients and hence conven-
tional off-the-shelf single element antenna clients1 could be used to
leverage this technique. Further, beamforming is complementary to
other MIMO techniques and could also be used with multi-antenna
clients.
Background: Given the importance of beamforming, there has
been signiﬁcant research in theory which suggests that with ac-
curate channel estimation at the Rx and its feedback to the Tx,
one could exploit the multipath channel optimally to improve link
throughput. When a transmitter with K antenna elements com-
municates with a receiver which has a single antenna element, the
wireless channel so formed is called a Multiple Input Single Output
(MISO) channel. The baseband channel model for a MISO channel
can be represented as
y = hT x + z
(1)
where the column vector h = [h1h2 . . . hK ]T is the vector of
channel gains between each Tx antenna and the Rx antenna, x is
the K × 1 vector of the transmitted signals, y is the received sig-
nal and z is the additive White Gaussian noise. A beamformer is
deﬁned as a vector of complex numbers w = [w1 w2... wK] which
translates each transmit symbol s to the signal vector x = ws to be
transmitted from the K antennas. By estimating the channel at the
Rx and conveying it to the Tx, the beamformer can be adjusted to
be the complex conjugate of the channel, so that the spatial chan-
nels from each Tx antenna combine coherently and reenforce each
other at the Rx. Thus, the optimal beamformer is given by w = h∗
,
where ∗ denotes the complex conjugate. We note that given the
channel vector h, the weights can be computed in a straightfor-
ward manner. Applying a complex weight to each antenna element
adjusts the magnitude and phase of the signal transmitted from that
element appropriately.
Channel Estimation: Beamforming requires channel estimation
between each Tx and Rx antenna, each of which is a complex
value which is composed of a magnitude and a phase component.
A conventional channel estimation procedure involves activating
each antenna in isolation and transmitting a ﬁxed sequence of bits
(preamble) on each antenna. This procedure is repeated for each
of the antennas [1]. The received complex baseband symbols (i.e.,
the amplitude and phase) are then used to determine the complex
channel gain hi using the structure of the preamble. The accuracy
of the received symbol value for all the preamble bits determines
the accuracy of the channel estimates. While the magnitudes of the
channel gains can be obtained easily, estimating the phase accu-
rately is more involved as described next.
Motivation: Practical channel estimation has the following prob-
lems, a) it requires specialized clients with the capability to mea-
sure the amplitude and phase of the received signals, b) even with
such clients, hardware synchronization impairments (frequency and
phase offsets) tend to corrupt the estimated channel coefﬁcients
[16], and c) the feedback overhead and processing delays are very
high making it hard to deploy.
In [16], we presented an intel-
ligent channel estimation scheme that performs measurements in
space rather than time to estimate the channel while overcoming
hardware synchronization impairments. Even though beamform-
ing using such an accurate channel estimation procedure is shown
1It should be noted that single element antennas can only produce
omni-directional radiation patterns
to provide much gain over Omni and directional beams, it requires
specialized clients which are capable of symbol level channel es-
timation (such as the software radio used in [16]). However, such
capability is not currently available on commercial WiFi clients.
Thus accurate channel estimation is a burden to achieving beam-
forming beneﬁts. Given the above practical impediments in procur-
ing channel state information at the Tx, the key question to ask is:
Can we develop a procedure that enables one to realize the beneﬁts
of beamforming using off-the-shelf clients?
Our contribution: We answer the above question in the afﬁrmative.
We provide a new beamforming solution that performs approxi-
mate channel estimation using signal power measurements at the
Rx in conjunction with an intelligent antenna activation algorithm
at the Tx. This solution still uses the concept of differential phase
estimation as in [16] but now computes the complex beamformer
weights using only the received signal power estimates (as opposed
to per symbol amplitude estimates). Consequently, (i) As an ap-
proximation to received power, RSSI measurement can be used to
compute beamformer weights, (ii) hardware oscillator impairments
are overcome by the use of differential phases, (iii) signiﬁcant ben-
eﬁts are obtained without hardware modiﬁcations to clients, and
(iv) the feedback overhead is low. Overall, the solution provides a
better balance of the performance-complexity tradeoff when com-
pared to both directional and beamforming based on accurate chan-
nel estimates.
We validate the practical feasibility of the algorithm by imple-
menting it on off-the-shelf WiFi clients. Using the developed sys-
tem, we conduct measurements in an ofﬁce environment to evalu-
ate the approximate beamforming solution using an eight-element
phased array AP and off-the-shelf single antenna omni-directional
clients. A summary of the results is as follows.
• The proposed beamforming solution reduces the multipath
fading induced packet loss rate from 6.5% to less than 0.3%
in a real indoor environment and improves throughput by up
to 7.1X and 1.64X compared to Omni and directional.
• Beamforming provides a median SNR gain of 10.5dB over
Omni and 3dB over directional antennas which is close to
the anticipated median gains of 11.5dB and 6dB when using
perfect channel estimates.
• Compared to Omni, beamforming also improves the connec-
tivity by reducing coverage holes and enhances the link sta-
bility signiﬁcantly.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we
present our beamforming solution that uses RSSI measurements.
Section 3 describes the results from an evaluation study of the pro-
posed scheme. Conclusions and future directions are presented in
Section 5.
2. BEAMFORMING USING RSSI
MEASUREMENTS
The beamforming procedure consist of two stages: (1) The trans-
mit activation stage and (2) the estimation and feedback stage as
illustrated in Figure 1. Conventional beamforming uses a simple
activation stage where the AP transmits a known sequence on each
antenna followed by a symbol level estimation and feedback. Since
commercial WiFi clients cannot provide symbol level estimates, we
design a more intelligent activation stage where multiple antennas
411√−1 with θ11 = 0. We also note that, irrespective of
and j =
the number of antennas used, we ensure that the total transmitted
power remains constant by normalizing the weights. In the rest of
this section, we describe the algorithm to identify optimal beam-
forming weights.
2.1 Algorithm steps
The algorithm consists of the following steps and is performed
at the Tx and Rx consecutively.
1. Single and tandem activation with equal weights:
In the single antenna activation stage, each one of the K ele-
ments at the Tx is activated in isolation, i.e. one at a time using
S consecutive packets for each antenna element. S is a parameter
that can be increased for more accurate estimates but is chosen to
be small to keep the overhead of the estimation process low (we
use S = 5 in our experiments). S becomes specially important to
perform right ambiguity resolution. This is followed by activating
two antenna elements at a time. One of the two antennas in each
activation is the reference antenna element and the other is chosen
successively from second to the Kth antenna.
2.RSSI measurement and computation of channel magnitudes and
phases:
The K − 1 received signal power values for each of the tandem
activations is noted at the Rx along with the K average signal pow-
ers for the single activations. These 2K − 1 values are then used to
compute the magnitudes |hi| =
Pi, 1 ≤ i ≤ K and the relative

is activated with a magnitude
P1+Pi and each of the phases
φij ,−φij, π − φij,−(π − φij) . Hence, for each of the K − 1
pairs, there are four activations corresponding to these four phases,
which we call the quadruple.
4. Accurate beam weight determination:
Of the four choices in each quadruple, the receiver identiﬁes the
choice which yields the largest signal strength at the receiver and
notes this as the unambiguous relative phase for each of the non-
reference antenna elements i.e. element 2 to element K. The ﬁnal
beamforming weights for each antenna element i is given by the
magnitude |wi| =
and the phase θi1.

2.2 Performance and robustness:
Computing the beamforming weights using the differential phases
(as described above) yields the same SNR improvement as using
absolute channel estimates as described below.
With ideal beamforming, the channel vector h is measured accu-
rately in both magnitude and phase. Let the magnitude be given as
ai = |hi| and the phase as bi = arg(hi). Hence, the beamforming

what would eventually be used by the beamformer; only ambiguity
in phase is being resolved at this point.

are activated in tandem followed by a simpler channel estimation
stage where signal power values are fed-back from the clients. Note
that RSSI is a good approximation of the received power 2, thereby
enabling the procedure to work with Off-the-Shelf clients.
Core idea: The algorithm is based on the idea of estimating dif-
ferential channel phases by employing tandem activation of more
than one antenna and using received power estimates. Thus, the
estimation process is distributed across space (elements) instead of
time. In conventional channel estimation, when a single antenna
is activated at a time, the received power is dependent only on the
channel magnitude and is given by Pi = |hi|2 (assuming the Tx
power is unity). Hence the information about the channel phase
arg(hi) is lost when the power is computed. In contrast, by the
tandem activation of more than one antenna element, the effects
of the channel phases are also reﬂected in the received power in a
manner that depends on the relative channel phases. i.e. when two
elements i and j are activated simultaneously with equal weights
(such that the transmitted power still adds up to unity), the received
power can be computed as Pij = |hi + hj|2. Thus, for tandem
activation, the received power Pij is given as
p
Pij = Pi + Pj + 2
PiPj cos(θij)
(2)
where θij is the channel phase difference between hi and hj. De-
pending on the relative channel phase θij, the two signals combine
together to change the signal power at the Rx. When θij = 0, the
signals combine constructively causing the powers of the individ-
ual elements to add up at the Rx. However, when θij = 180 the
signals combine destructively causing the received power to be the
difference of the powers transmitted from the individual antennas.
Hence, the change in the received power across a strategic set of ac-
