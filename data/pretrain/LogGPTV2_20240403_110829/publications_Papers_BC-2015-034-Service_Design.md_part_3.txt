### Creating a Stakeholder Map

To create a stakeholder map, service designers need to undertake two essential steps:

1. **Identify Stakeholders:**
   - **Initial Identification:** Relevant stakeholders must be identified, grouped if necessary, and positioned on the map. Naming stakeholders can be challenging.
   - **Classification:** Stakeholders can be classified into primary and secondary categories. Primary stakeholders are those without whose participation an organization cannot survive. Secondary stakeholders, while having mutual influence with the organization, are neither critical for its survival nor do they engage in transactions with it [25].
   - **Granularity:** At a high level, many stakeholder groups, particularly primary ones, can be named easily (e.g., customers, suppliers, and investors). However, for the service design process, a more detailed level of granularity is needed. Service designers spend significant effort uncovering important but not obvious stakeholders, such as experts, skeptics, extreme users, misusers, and early adopters. In Chapter 3 (Service Innovation), the customer system tool introduced can help service designers think of different customer roles, i.e., buyer, user, and influencer.

2. **Draw Relations:**
   - **Visualizing Relationships:** To complete the stakeholder map, relationships or mutual stakes between the various parties (stakeholders) need to be visualized.
   - **Perspectives on Stakes:** There are many perspectives on what a stake is and how to categorize them, such as owning equity, economic impact, and political influence. In practice, for simplicity and overview, service designers tend to represent all types of stakes between stakeholders as arrows on the map and label these arrows in natural language rather than category names.

Similar to a context map, the stakeholder map is created at the beginning of a service design project and is maintained throughout its entire lifecycle.

### The Persona

The stakeholder map provides an overview of the most critical groups to consider during a service design project. However, the names of the groups and their most essential relations to other domain players do not yet allow designers to step into the "shoes" of individuals within these groups and view the world from their perspective, i.e., to act human-centric.

The persona concept stems from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research [26, 27, 28] and helps bridge the gap between more abstract customer segments and the aim to design from the perspective of an individual. For each stakeholder group in the stakeholder map, one or more archetypical representations are created. A persona is an almost real, typical yet individual description created to represent a group.

**Definition — Persona:**
A persona is a "fictitious, specific, concrete representation of target users" that puts "a face on the user—a memorable, engaging, and actionable image that serves as a design target." [27, p. 11].

One can think of a persona as a role in a theatre play. Similar to an actor, service designers can slip into this role or engage in dialogue with it. Cooper [26, p. 123] emphasizes that personas are discovered through thorough investigation rather than being made up. To make the persona more "relatable," it gets a fictional name, personal information, and a picture. Demographic information, such as age, gender, marital status, children, relationships, level of income, and education, provide a factual basis.

Additionally, context-oriented information related to the service design challenge needs to be added to the persona. This includes requirements, needs, or wishes the persona typically expresses. To gain a more personal and holistic picture, softer information is added, such as a description of the persona’s personality, including character, beliefs, life mottos, feelings, and mood. This type of information may help uncover less obvious needs or underlying motivations of the persona. Creating an empathy map [23] helps generate some of this information. This approach suggests reflecting on how a person perceives a certain situation, i.e., what the person thinks, sees, says, does, feels, and hears [28].

**Objectives of Using a Persona in a Service Design Project:**
1. Understand behavior, needs, and preferences of typical representatives of stakeholder groups.
2. Make the underlying motivations clearer.
3. Enable service designers to put themselves in the persona's shoes when analyzing situations and creating solutions.

**Example of a Persona: Andrew Thompson**

  - Contact with locals to learn about culture and heritage
  - Quiet nights in hotels to seize as much of every day as possible
  - As organizer of the trip, things should work as planned
  - Indulges in a bit of luxury to relax from work
  - The holiday was a present for his spouse

- **Personal Information:**
  - Nationality: British
  - Residence: Brighton, UK
  - Age: 47
  - Marital Status: Engaged
  - Children: None
  - Occupation: IT Project Manager at a bank
  - Hobbies: Travelling, Photography
  - Income: £ 75,000+
  - Education: MBA from LBS

- **Personality, Character, Beliefs, Life Motto:**
  - Hardworking
  - Generally friendly, as long as common sense is not violated
  - Seeks new, inspiring experiences
  - Slightly extroverted
  - Value for money: Happy to spend if the value is promising
  - Reliable person who expects reliability from others
  - His opinion is heard and valued by others
  - Beliefs: People are good, friendly, and honest, but sometimes just not clever enough
  - Life Motto: “I seek inspiration everywhere”

**Critical Success Factors for Implementing the Persona Concept:**
1. **Customization of the Template:** The customization of the template to use in a service design project is crucial. Depending on how a project develops, additional or different information, which was not expected at the beginning, is required.
2. **Iterative Process:** Over the course of a project, a persona will mature in terms of its description. The information gained over time needs to be reflected and incorporated into the persona, making it more real and complete.
3. **Treating the Persona Like a Team Member:** Practitioners report the importance of treating a persona like a project team member. Physical representations of the persona, such as posters in the project room, role-plays, or even dolls at the meeting table, support the designers' endeavor to put themselves in the persona's shoes.

### The Customer Journey Map

The methods outlined so far enable service designers to step into a persona's shoes. Now, an approach is needed to help the service designer walk in those shoes and capture what they see with the persona’s eyes. For this, the idea of a customer journey map—a visual representation of a service customer’s experience—is used.

**Definition — Customer Journey Map:**
“A customer journey map provides a vivid but structured visualization of a service user’s experience” [11].

According to Zomerdijk and Voss ([29], p. 74), it “involves all activities and events related to the delivery of a service from the customer’s perspective,” and—as nicely phrased by one of their interviewees—it is used to understand the behavior, feelings, motivations, and attitudes of customers throughout the journey.

**Structural Elements:**
- **Service Episodes and Encounters:** Customer journey maps are closely linked to the key concepts of service episodes and service encounters (see also Chapter 8 – Service Co-creation). Services comprise several episodes with defined start and end points, and consist of several encounters, i.e., interactions between a service provider and a service customer [30]. In our hotel opening case, “booking a hotel room” or “staying at the hotel” are examples of episodes of the service “hotel visit.” Check-in, ordering a drink at the bar, or check-out are typical encounters of the episode “staying at the hotel.” A customer journey visualizes a service with its episodes (also referred to as phases) and encounters (often called touchpoints).

**Commonalities of Customer Journey Maps:**
- **Perspective:** The customer and their experience play the central role in a customer journey. The focus is on the customer’s perspective. Operational aspects of the service provider beyond direct interaction with the customer are not displayed in the map.
- **Touchpoints:** The elements and actions depicted in the customer journey map are touchpoints between the customer and the provider, i.e., every situation where a customer gets in touch with the provider. Touchpoints range from hearing the provider’s name (e.g., by word of mouth) to interactions during the actual service provision.
- **Timeframe:** As the variety of touchpoints suggests, customer journeys start long before the service takes place and end after it is provided. Thus, the timespan to consider for service design is questioned and, most likely, extended compared to the limited perspective on direct interactions between customers and service providers.

**Development and Usage of a Customer Journey Map:**
- **Identify Persona:** A customer journey map is the visual representation of a specific service customer’s experience. Determining one of the previously defined personas as the customer whose perspective to take is the initial step to create a map.
- **Frame the Timespan:** Voss and Zomerdijk [12] pointed out that the timeframe covered by a journey exceeds the duration from sale to provision of a service. The guiding question should be: When does the customer recognize a requirement for the first time that may result in demand for a service? This may be long before a provider’s name crosses the customer’s mind.
- **Envision Journey:** With a persona, a timeframe, and phases at hand, the service designer can conduct the mapping of the customer journey, i.e., walking in the persona’s shoes and visualizing its experiences. This process is iterative. Designers alternate between:
  1. Anticipating the persona’s steps, behavior, and emotions.
  2. Observing, interviewing, or engaging with real customers who are similar to their persona to gain additional information.
  3. Abstracting from the gathered real-world data.

For the second step, learning from real customers, service designers draw from a broad set of tools. Shadowing customers, documenting their behavior on video, photo, recordings, notes, etc., is one of those tools. Another popular tool is called "a day in the life," which is quite similar to shadowing and works with the same recording devices. However, the focus is on a typical day in the life of a person rather than how a person experiences and behaves with a particular service. This tool is particularly strong in enabling designers to understand a typical day in the life of a person as an environment for the service.

All gathered data is then mapped onto a canvas, the customer journey map. Since all services with humans as customers entail an experience on their side, keeping track of the emotions that contribute to the overall service experience of the customer is worth recording. Thus, the perception map (see Figure 4.7.c) showing the mood level associated with each touchpoint is a strong visualization.
