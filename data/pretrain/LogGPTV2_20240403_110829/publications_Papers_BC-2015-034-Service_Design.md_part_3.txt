Themethodsoutlinedsofarenabledservicedesignerstostepintoapersona’sshoes.
Now, anapproachisneededtohelptheservicedesignertowalkinthoseshoes
andcapturewhattheyseewiththepersona’seyes. Forthis,theideaofacustomer
journeymap-–avisualrepresentationofaservicecustomer’sexperience–isused.
Definition —CustomerJourneyMap. “Acustomerjourneymapprovidesa
vividbutstructuredvisualizationofaserviceuser’sexperience”[11].
AccordingtoZomerdijkandVoss([29],p.74),it“involvesallactivitiesand
eventsrelatedtothedeliveryofaservicefromthecustomer’sperspective”,and–as
nicelyphrasedbyoneoftheirinterviewees–itisusedtounderstandthebehavior,
feelings,motivations,andattitudesofcustomersthroughoutthejourney.
Structurally, customer journey maps are closely linked to the key concepts
service episodes and service encounters (see also the Chapter 8 – Service Co-
creation). Servicescompriseseveralepisodeswithadefinedstartandendpoints,
andconsistofseveralencounters,i.e.,interactionsbetweenaserviceproviderand
a service customer [30]. In our hotel opening case, “booking a hotel room” or
“stayingatthehotel”areexamplesofepisodesoftheservice“hotelvisit”.Check-in,
ordering a drink at the bar, or check-out are typical encounters of the episode
“stayingatthehotel”. Acustomerjourneyvisualizesaservicewithitsepisodes
(alsoreferredtoasphases)andencounters(oftencalledtouchpoints).
Therearenostandardsintermsofwhatacustomerjourneylookslikeandthus,
asFigure4.7shows,manydifferenttemplatesareused. Nonetheless,basedonthe
analysisofseveralcasestudies,VossandZomerdijk[12]identifythefollowing
commonalitiesofthevariouscustomerjourneymaps:
Perspective The customer and customer’s experience play the central role in a
customerjourney. Thefocusisonthecustomerperspective. Operational

FrametheTimespan
Voss and Zomerdijk [12] pointed out that the timeframe covered by a journey
exceedsthedurationfromsalestoprovisionofaservice. Hence,whenisajourney
supposedtostartandwhenisitsupposedtoend? Asthejourneyincorporatesall
touchpointsbetweenthecustomerandprovider,onemightstartthejourneywith
thecustomerrecognizingtheprovideroritsnameforthefirsttime. However,this
would still be a provider-centric mindset to a certain extent. In fact, following
thisidea,importantstepsmightbemissed. Theguidingquestionshouldratherbe
whendoesthecustomerrecognizearequirementforthefirsttimethatmayresult
indemandforaservice? Thismaybelongbeforeaprovider’snameevencrosses
thecustomer’smind.
To give an example, people who consider buying a house or an apartment
typically get motivated by events such as moving to a new location or seeing
friendsbuyingahouse. Theyprobablystartaskingthemselveswhetherbuyinga
propertyisagoodidea. Walkingaroundlookingatotherpeople’shousesmore
reflectively might be the next step before they start screening the Internet for
real estate prices in their region and comparing them to their personal financial
situation. Fromtheperspectiveofareal-estateagentorabankmostofthesteps

However, supporting people in early phases and providing guidance might be
