missions. These information systems and networks are composed of ICT/OT10 products and 
components made available by suppliers, developers, and system integrators. Enterprises also 
acquire and deploy an array of products and services, including: 
• Custom software for information systems built to be deployed within the enterprise, made 
available by developers; 
• Operations, maintenance, and disposal support for information systems and networks 
within and outside of the enterprise’s boundaries,11 made available by system integrators 
or other ICT/OT-related service providers; and 
• External services to support the enterprise’s operations that are positioned both inside and 
outside of the authorization boundaries, made available by external system service 
providers.

10 NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2 defines Operational Technology as: 
Programmable systems or devices that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical 
environment). These systems/devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and 
events. Examples include industrial control systems, building management systems, fire control systems, and physical access control 
mechanisms. 
11 For federal information systems, this is the Authorization Boundary, defined in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 as: 
All components of an information system to be authorized for operation by an authorizing official. This excludes separately authorized 
systems to which the information system is connected.

These services may span the entire SDLC for an information system or service and may be: 
• Performed by the staff employed by the enterprise, developer, system integrator, or 
external system service provider; 
• Physically hosted by the enterprise, developer, system integrator, or external system 
service provider; 
• Supported or comprised of development environments, logistics/delivery environments 
that transport information systems and components, or applicable system and 
communications interfaces; 
• Proprietary, open source, or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software. 
The responsibility and accountability for the services and associated activities performed by 
different parties within this ecosystem are usually defined by agreement documents between the 
enterprise and suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and 
other ICT/OT-related service providers.  
1.5.2. Supplier Relationships Within Enterprises 
Enterprises depend on the supply chain to provide a variety of products and services to enable 
the enterprise to achieve its strategic and operational objectives. Identifying cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain is complicated by the information asymmetry that exists between 
acquiring enterprises and their suppliers and service providers. Acquirers often lack visibility and 
understanding of how acquired technology is developed, integrated, and deployed and how the 
services that they acquire are delivered. Additionally, acquirers with inadequate or absent C-
SCRM processes, procedures, and practices may experience increased exposure cybersecurity 
risks throughout the supply chain. The level of exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain depends largely on the relationship between the products and services provided and 
the criticality of the missions, business processes, and systems that they support. Enterprises 
have a variety of relationships with their suppliers, developers, system integrators, external 
system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. Figure 1-2 depicts how 
these diverse relationships affect an enterprise’s visibility and control of the supply chain.

Fig. 1-2: An Enterprise’s Visibility, Understanding, and Control of its Supply Chain 
Some supply chain relationships are tightly intermingled, such as a system integrator’s 
development of a complex information system operating within the federal agency’s 
authorization boundary or the management of federal agency information systems and resources 
by an external service provider. These relationships are usually guided by an agreement (e.g., 
contract) that establishes detailed functional, technical, and security requirements and may 
provide for the custom development or significant customization of products and services. For 
these relationships, system integrators and external service providers are likely able to work with 
the enterprise to implement such processes and controls (listed within this document) that are 
deemed appropriate based on the results of a criticality and risk assessment and cost/benefit 
analysis. This may include floating requirements upstream in the supply chain to ensure higher 
confidence in the satisfaction of necessary assurance objectives. The decision to extend such 
requirements must be balanced with an appreciation of what is feasible and cost-effective. The 
degree to which system integrators and external service providers are expected to implement C-
SCRM processes and controls should be weighed against the risks to the enterprise posed by not 
adhering to those additional requirements. Often, working directly with the system integrators 
and external service providers to proactively identify appropriate mitigation processes and 
controls will help create a more cost-effective strategy. 
Procuring ICT/OT products from suppliers establishes a direct relationship between those 
suppliers and the acquirers. This relationship is also usually guided by an agreement between the 
acquirer and the supplier. However, commercial ICT/OT developed by suppliers are typically 
designed for general purposes for a global market and are not tailored to an individual 
customer’s specific operational or threat environments. Enterprises should perform due diligence 
and research regarding their specific C-SCRM requirements to determine if an IT solution is fit

for purpose,12 includes requisite security features and capabilities, will meet quality and 
resiliency expectations, and requires support by the supplier for the product or product 
components over its life cycle.   
An assessment of the findings of an acquirer’s research about a product, which may include 
engaging in direct dialogue with suppliers whenever possible, will help acquirers understand the 
characteristics and capabilities of existing ICT/OT products and services, set expectations and 
requirements for suppliers, and identify C-SCRM needs not yet satisfied by the market. It can 
also help identify emerging solutions that may at least partially support the acquirer’s needs. 
Overall, such research and engagement with a supplier will allow the acquirer to better articulate 
their requirements to align with and drive market offerings and to make risk-based decisions 
about product purchases, configurations, and usages within their environment. 
Managing Cost and Resources 
Balancing exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain with the costs and 
benefits of implementing C-SCRM practices and controls should be a key component of the 
acquirer’s overall approach to C-SCRM. 
Enterprises should be aware that implementing C-SCRM practices and controls necessitates 
additional financial and human resources. Requiring a greater level of testing, documentation, or 
security features from suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service 
providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers may increase the price of a product or 
service, which may result in increased cost to the acquirer. This is especially true for those 
products and services developed for general-purpose applications and not tailored to the specific 
enterprise security or C-SCRM requirements. When deciding whether to require and implement 
C-SCRM practices and controls, acquirers should consider both the costs of implementing these 
controls and the risks of not implementing them.  
When possible and appropriate, acquirers should allow suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers the opportunity to 
reuse applicable existing data and documentation that may provide evidence to support C-SCRM 
(e.g., certification of a vendor to a relevant standard, such as ISO 27001). Doing this results in 
cost savings to the acquirer and supplier. However, in some cases, documentation reuse may not 
be appropriate as additional or different information may be needed, and a reassessment may be 
required (e.g., previously audited supplier developing a new, not yet produced product).  
Regardless, acquirers should identify and include security considerations early in the acquisition 
process.  
12 “Fit for purpose” is a term used to informally describe a process, configuration item, IT service, etc. that is capable of meeting its objectives or 
service levels. Being fit for purpose requires suitable design, implementation, control, and maintenance. (Adapted from Information Technology 
Infrastructure Library (ITIL) Service Strategy [ITIL Service Strategy].)

Methodology for Building C-SCRM Guidance Using NIST SP 800-39; NIST SP 800-
37, Rev 2; and NIST SP 800-53, Rev 5 
This publication applies the multilevel risk management approach of [NIST SP 800-39] by 
providing C-SCRM guidance at the enterprise, mission, and operational levels. It also introduces 
a navigational system for [SP 800-37, Rev. 2] allowing users to focus on relevant sections of this 
publication more easily. Finally, it contains an enhanced overlay of specific C-SCRM controls, 
building on [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5]. 
The guidance/controls contained in this publication are built on existing multidisciplinary 
practices and are intended to increase the ability of enterprises to manage the associated 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain over the entire life cycle of systems, products, 
and services. It should be noted that this publication gives enterprises the flexibility to either 
develop stand-alone documentation (e.g., policies, assessment and authorization [A&A] plan, 
and C-SCRM plan) for C-SCRM or to integrate it into existing agency documentation. 
For individual systems, this guidance is recommended for use with information systems at all 
impact categories, according to [FIPS 199]. The agencies may choose to prioritize applying this 
guidance to systems at a higher impact level or to specific system components. Finally, this 
document describes the development and implementation of C-SCRM Strategies and 
Implementation Plans for development at the enterprise and mission and business level of an 
enterprise and a C-SCRM system plan at the operational level of an enterprise. A C-SCRM plan 
at the operational level is informed by the cybersecurity supply chain risk assessments and 
should contain C-SCRM controls tailored to specific agency mission and business needs, 
operational environments, and/or implementing technologies.  
Integration into the Risk Management Process 
The processes in this publication should be integrated into the enterprise’s existing SDLCs and 
enterprise environments at all levels of risk management processes and hierarchy (e.g., 
enterprise, mission, system), as described in [NIST SP 800-39]. Section 2 provides an overview 
of the [NIST SP 800-39] risk management hierarchy and approach and identifies C-SCRM 
activities in the risk management process. Appendix C builds on Section 2 of [NIST SP 800-39], 
providing descriptions and explanations of ICT/OT SCRM activities. The structure of Appendix 
C mirrors [NIST SP 800-39]. 
Implementing C-SCRM in the Context of SP 800-37, Revision 2 
C-SCRM activities described in this publication are closely related to the Risk Management 
Framework described in [NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2]. Specifically, C-SCRM processes conducted 
at the operational level should closely mirror and/or serve as inputs to those steps completed as 
part of [NIST SP 800-37, Rev 2]. C-SCRM activities completed at Levels 1 and 2 should provide 
inputs (e.g., risk assessment results) to the operational level and RMF-type processes, where 
possible and applicable. Section 2 and Appendix C describe the linkages between C-SCRM and 
[NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2] in further detail.

This second publication describes the need for determining the priorities of each of those 
risks in light of their potential impact on enterprise objectives, as well as options for 
properly treating that risk. This report describes how risk priorities and risk response 
information are added to the cybersecurity risk register (CSRR) in support of an overall 
enterprise risk register. Information about the selection of and projected cost of risk 
response will be used to maintain a composite view of cybersecurity risks throughout the 
enterprise, which may be used to confirm and adjust risk strategy to ensure mission 
success.  
This publication also draws upon concepts and work from other regulations, government reports, 
standards, guidelines, and best practices. A full list of those resources can be found in Appendix

Key Takeaways13 
The Supply Chain. ICT/OT relies on a globally distributed, interconnected supply chain 
ecosystem that consists of public and private sector entities (e.g., acquirers, suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers).  
Supply Chain Products and Services. Products and services that enterprises rely on the supply 
chain for include the provision of systems and system components, open source and custom 
software, operational support services, hosting systems and services, and performing system 
support roles.   
Supply Chain Benefits and Risk. This ecosystem offers benefits such as cost savings, 
interoperability, rapid innovation, product feature variety, and the ability to choose between 
competing vendors. However, the same mechanisms that provide those benefits might also 
introduce a variety of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain (e.g., a supplier disruption 
that causes a reduction in service levels and leads to dissatisfaction from the enterprise’s 
customer base).  
Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM). C-SCRM, as described in this 
document, is a systematic process that aims to help enterprises manage cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain. Enterprises should identify, adopt, and tailor the practices described 
in this document to best suit their unique strategic, operational, and risk context. 
Scope of C-SCRM. C-SCRM encompasses a wide array of stakeholder groups that include 
information security and privacy, system developers and implementers, acquisition, 
procurement, legal, and HR. C-SCRM covers activities that span the entire system development 
life cycle (SDLC), from initiation to disposal. In addition, identified cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain should be aggregated and contextualized as part of enterprise risk 
management processes to ensure that the enterprise understands the total risk exposure of its 
critical operations to different risk types (e.g., financial risk, strategic risk).

 INTEGRATION OF C-SCRM INTO ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT14 
C-SCRM should be integrated into the enterprise-wide risk management process described in 
[NIST SP 800-39] and depicted in Figure 2-1. This process includes the following continuous
