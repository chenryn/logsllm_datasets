### Integration of Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) into Enterprise-Wide Risk Management

#### 1. Information Systems and Networks
Information systems and networks are composed of ICT/OT products and components provided by suppliers, developers, and system integrators. Enterprises acquire and deploy a range of products and services, including:

- **Custom Software**: Developed specifically for the enterprise's information systems.
- **Operations, Maintenance, and Disposal Support**: Provided by system integrators or other ICT/OT-related service providers, both within and outside the enterprise’s boundaries.
- **External Services**: Supporting the enterprise’s operations, positioned both inside and outside the authorization boundaries, provided by external system service providers.

**Definitions:**
- **Operational Technology (OT)**: Programmable systems or devices that interact with the physical environment, such as industrial control systems, building management systems, and physical access control mechanisms.
- **Authorization Boundary**: All components of an information system to be authorized for operation, excluding separately authorized systems to which the information system is connected.

These services span the entire System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and may involve:
- **Staff**: Employed by the enterprise, developer, system integrator, or external service provider.
- **Hosting**: Physically hosted by the enterprise, developer, system integrator, or external service provider.
- **Environments**: Development, logistics, and delivery environments, along with applicable system and communications interfaces.
- **Hardware and Software**: Proprietary, open source, or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS).

Responsibilities and accountabilities for these services are typically defined in agreements between the enterprise and its suppliers, developers, system integrators, and service providers.

#### 2. Supplier Relationships Within Enterprises
Enterprises rely on the supply chain to provide products and services that enable them to achieve their strategic and operational objectives. However, identifying cybersecurity risks in the supply chain is challenging due to information asymmetry. Acquirers often lack visibility into how acquired technology is developed, integrated, and deployed, and how services are delivered. Inadequate C-SCRM processes can increase exposure to cybersecurity risks.

The level of risk exposure depends on the criticality of the missions, business processes, and systems supported by the products and services. Enterprises have various relationships with suppliers, developers, system integrators, and service providers, which affect their visibility and control over the supply chain.

**Figure 1-2: An Enterprise’s Visibility, Understanding, and Control of its Supply Chain**

Some supply chain relationships, such as those with system integrators and external service providers, are tightly intermingled. These relationships are guided by detailed agreements that establish functional, technical, and security requirements. System integrators and external service providers can work with the enterprise to implement appropriate C-SCRM processes and controls based on criticality and risk assessments.

Procuring ICT/OT products from suppliers establishes a direct relationship, usually guided by an agreement. Commercial ICT/OT products are designed for general purposes and may not be tailored to specific customer needs. Enterprises should perform due diligence to ensure that IT solutions meet their C-SCRM requirements, including security features, quality, and resiliency.

#### 3. Managing Cost and Resources
Balancing cybersecurity risks with the costs and benefits of implementing C-SCRM practices is crucial. Implementing C-SCRM practices and controls requires additional financial and human resources, potentially increasing the cost of products and services. Enterprises should consider both the costs and the risks of not implementing C-SCRM controls.

When possible, acquirers should allow suppliers and service providers to reuse existing data and documentation to support C-SCRM, resulting in cost savings. However, in some cases, additional or different information may be needed, requiring reassessment.

Security considerations should be included early in the acquisition process to ensure that products and services meet the enterprise's C-SCRM requirements.

#### 4. Methodology for Building C-SCRM Guidance
This publication applies the multilevel risk management approach of NIST SP 800-39, providing C-SCRM guidance at the enterprise, mission, and operational levels. It also introduces a navigational system for NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, and contains an enhanced overlay of specific C-SCRM controls based on NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5.

The guidance is built on existing multidisciplinary practices and aims to help enterprises manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. Enterprises can either develop stand-alone C-SCRM documentation or integrate it into existing agency documentation.

#### 5. Relationship to Other Publications and Publication Summary
This publication builds on and tailors concepts from other NIST publications, including the Cybersecurity Framework, FIPS 199, SP 800-30, SP 800-37, SP 800-39, SP 800-53, SP 800-53B, SP 800-160, NISTIR 7622, NISTIR 8179, NISTIR 8276, NISTIR 8286, NISTIR 8286A, and NISTIR 8286B. A full list of resources can be found in Appendix H.

#### Key Takeaways
- **Supply Chain Ecosystem**: Consists of public and private sector entities, including acquirers, suppliers, developers, system integrators, and service providers.
- **Products and Services**: Include systems, software, operational support, hosting, and system support roles.
- **Benefits and Risks**: The supply chain offers cost savings, interoperability, and rapid innovation but also introduces cybersecurity risks.
- **C-SCRM**: A systematic process to manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, tailored to the enterprise's unique context.
- **Scope of C-SCRM**: Encompasses various stakeholder groups and spans the entire SDLC, integrating with enterprise risk management processes.

#### Integration of C-SCRM into Enterprise-Wide Risk Management
C-SCRM should be integrated into the enterprise-wide risk management process, as described in NIST SP 800-39. This integration ensures that identified cybersecurity risks are aggregated and contextualized, providing a comprehensive understanding of the total risk exposure to the enterprise's critical operations.
