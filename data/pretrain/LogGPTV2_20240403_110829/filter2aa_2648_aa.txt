### The "Great Debate"
How should the information infrastructure of the future balance the individual’s desire for privacy with the state’s interest in monitoring suspected criminals?

### Steve Jackson Games and the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)
- **Passed in 1994**: CALEA requires telecommunications companies to cooperate with the interception of traffic on their networks by providing technical interfaces for that purpose.
- **Original Scope**: Initially, CALEA did not apply to "Information Services."
- **2005 FCC Ruling**: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that CALEA applies to broadband Internet providers.
- **Pre-existing Solutions**: The Cisco Architecture for Lawful Intercept pre-dated this ruling. By 2005, some European countries already required these interfaces for Internet networks.
- **Voluntary Compliance**: Providers may voluntarily create these interfaces even when not required to do so, as they need to grant access to communications somehow. A well-defined interface makes wiretapping less disruptive to network operations.

### IETF Policy on Wiretapping (RFC 2804)
- **International Body**: The IETF is an international body and cannot address the laws of every country.
- **Wiretapping Complexity**: Wiretapping the Internet is either easy or impossible.
- **Strong Cryptography**: RFC 1984 emphasizes that the development of the Internet requires wide availability of strong cryptographic technology, and the Internet should be free from security loopholes.
- **Complexity and Vulnerability**: Adding a requirement for wiretapping makes protocols more complex, which can introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Open Description**: The IETF believes that the publication of wiretapping mechanisms and known weaknesses is beneficial. In keeping with this philosophy, Cisco and the IETF published RFC 3924, which describes the Cisco Architecture for Lawful Intercept in IP networks.

### The Cisco Architecture for Lawful Intercept
- **Based on ETSI Standards**: The architecture is based on the Lawful Intercept architecture defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).
- **SNMPv3 Interface**: It provides the ability to wiretap IP networks through an SNMPv3 interface.
- **Publication and Implementation**: Described in RFC 3924 and some Internet Drafts, it was published in 2003/2004 and implemented in edge router and switch models such as 7600/10000/12000/AS5000.
- **Vendor Support**: Many other companies support the same overall architecture for Lawful Intercept, with different vendors supplying various interoperable components.

### Mediation Device Vendors
- **Mediation Device Equipment Suppliers**: Include Aqsacom, ETI, Group 2000, Pine Digital Security, Verint, SS8, SUNTECH Intelligent Solutions, Utimaco, Accuris, ATIS systems, DigiVox, GTEN AG, NICE Systems, Teletron, and Urmet Group.

### The Interception Request
- **CTapStreamIpEntry**:

  CTapMediationEntry ::= SEQUENCE { 
    cTapMediationContentId Integer32, 
    cTapMediationDestAddressType InetAddressType, 
    cTapMediationDestAddress InetAddress,

    cTapMediationDataType Integer32, 
    cTapMediationRetransmitType Integer32, 
    cTapMediationTimeout DateAndTime, 
    cTapMediationTransport INTEGER,
    cTapMediationNotificationEnable TruthValue,
    cTapMediationStatus RowStatus } 
  ```

### Security Concerns for Lawful Intercept
- **Preventing Discovery and Manipulation**: Preventing the subject from discovering the surveillance and manipulating the surveillance.
- **Eavesdropper’s Dilemma**: Handling packets with incorrect checksums.
- **Protecting the Interface**: Preventing unauthorized use, provisioning of unauthorized wiretaps, and ensuring authorized wiretaps do not collect information outside the scope of authorization.

### Gaining Unauthorized Access
- **Example Network**: Service Provider Management Network, Service Provider Network, Internet, Mediation Device, Surveillance Target, SNMP Network Monitor, IAP Edge Router, Other Customers.
- **Attack Scenario**: Attacker's Server, Unauthorized Interception Requests, Bypassing Authentication, Brute Forcing SNMPv3 Usernames and Passwords, Lack of Audit Trails.

### CVE-2008-0960 – Bypassing Authentication
- **Message Digests**: SNMPv3 Message Digests are the first 12 bytes of a cryptographic hash of the message contents combined with a secret key.
- **Implementation Flaw**: Many implementations did not throw out message digests that weren’t 12 bytes long, leading to a vulnerability where an attacker could send 256 messages with different 1-byte HMACs, and one would be accepted.
- **Impact**: Disclosed in June 2008, impacting multiple vendors including Linux, Solaris, OSX, Juniper, and Cisco. Some implementations were vulnerable for over 6 years.

### Brute Forcing SNMPv3 Usernames and Passwords
- **usmMIBBasicGroup**: Includes various objects for monitoring and managing SNMPv3 users and their authentication and privacy settings.

### Lack of Audit Trails
- **Noisy Attacks**: Attacks on SNMPv3 authentication are noisy, but monitoring these attacks using traps is challenging.
- **Cisco Documentation**: Advises enabling SNMP trap notifications, but no IOS version tested sent authentication failure traps for SNMPv3 messages with the wrong username, password, or Engine values.
- **Documentation Update**: Cisco updated its documentation to indicate that SNMPv3 authentication failure traps are not generated.

### TAP-MIB
- **Audit Trail Manipulation**: The attacker can turn the audit trail off, further complicating the detection and prevention of unauthorized access.
