The “Great Debate”
How should the information infrastructure of the 
future balance the individual’s desire for privacy 
with the state’s interest in monitoring suspected 
criminals?

Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
– Passed in 1994
– Requires Telecommunications Companies to cooperate with the interception of 
traffic on their networks by providing technical interfaces for that purpose
– Originally did not apply to “Information Services.”
 In 2005 the FCC ruled that CALEA applies to broadband Internet providers
– The Cisco Architecture for Lawful Intercept pre-dated this ruling 
– By 2005 Some European countries already required these interfaces for Internet 
networks
– Providers may voluntarily create these interfaces even when not required to 
• The provider is going to have to grant access to the communications somehow
• A well defined interface makes wiretapping less disruptive to network operations
IETF Policy on Wiretapping (RFC 2804)
The IETF will not consider requirements for wiretapping in protocol designs
– The IETF is an international body and can’t address the laws of every country
– Wiretapping the Internet is either easy or its impossible
• RFC 1984 – Development of the Internet requires wide availability of strong 
cryptographic technology
– The Internet should be free from security loopholes
• Adding a requirement for wiretapping makes protocols more complex
– Complexity begets vulnerability
• The interfaces that provide wiretap access could be used with authorization
– “On the other hand,” wiretapping technologies should be openly described
• “The IETF believes that the publication of such mechanisms, and the 
publication of known weaknesses in such mechanisms, is a Good Thing.”
• In keeping with this philosophy, Cisco and the IETF published RFC 3924 –
The Cisco Architecture for Lawful Intercept in IP networks
The Cisco Architecture for Lawful Intercept
The Cisco Architecture for Lawful Intercept in IP networks
–
Based on the Lawful Intercept architecture defined by the European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
–
An SNMPv3 interface that provides the ability to wiretap IP networks
–
Described in RFC 3924 and some Internet Drafts
–
Publish in 2003/2004
–
Implemented in edge router and switch models 
•
7600/10000/12000/AS5000
–
A myriad of other companies support the same overall architecture for 
Lawful Intercept
–
Different vendors may supply a service provider with various interoperable 
components of the overall architecture for lawful intercept

Security Concerns for Lawful Intercept
 Preventing the subject from discovering the surveillance
 Preventing the subject from manipulating the surveillance
– Transmitting information that was not collected
– Inducing the collection of information that was not transmitted
– The Eavesdropper’s Dilemma: What do you do with packets that have the 
wrong checksum? 
 Protecting the interface from unauthorized use
– Preventing the provisioning of unauthorized wiretaps
– Preventing an authorized wiretap from collecting information outside the scope 
of the authorization

Attacker’s 
Server
An Attack…
Unauthorized Interception Requests
-
Single, properly authenticated SNMPv3 packet accessing the TAP-MIB
1. The correct username and password are required
2. Attacker would need the correct SNMPv3 EngineID, EngineBoots, and EngineTime
values
-
These values are intended to prevent authenticated SNMPv3 messages from 
being replayed
-
They can be obtained with a single unauthenticated transaction
-
They can be shared between clients
3. Attacker would need to be able to send a packet that the interface will receive
-
Packet filtering might interfere with this.
4. Encryption might prove to be an obstacle
CVE-2008-0960 – Bypassing Authentication
 SNMPv3 Message Digests are the first 12 bytes of a cryptographic hash of the 
message contents combined with a secret key, which is a combination of the 
password and the EngineID of the SNMP service
 The RFC says message digests that aren’t 12 bytes long should be thrown out 
but many implementations didn’t. 
 The result of the local HMAC calculation is going to be greater than 12 bytes, so 
many implementations performed this comparison operation: 
memcmp( myHMACbuffer, packetHMACbuffer, packetHMAClength ) 
 Attacker can send 256 messages with different 1-byte HMACs and one will be 
accepted. 
CVE-2008-0960 – Bypassing Authentication
 Disclosed in June, 2008 
 Multiple Vendors impacted (Linux, Solaris, OSX, Juniper, and Cisco)
 Some implementations were vulnerable for over 6 years
 Most Cisco software that supports Lawful Intercept was not vulnerable
– IOS 12.3(7)XI before 12.3(7)XI8a
– 12.3(7)XI supports lawful intercept in 10000 Series Routers
 Cisco 10000 series routers
– Edge router for broadband service providers
– Supports IP “VPNs”

Lack of Audit Trails
 Attacks on SNMPv3 authentication are noisy – it would be nice if you could monitor those 
attacks using traps!
 Cisco’s Configuration Guide for Lawful Intercept advises network administrators to enable 
SNMP trap notifications
 Cisco’s documentation implies that traps will be sent “for packets with an incorrect SHA/MD5 
authentication key or for a packet that is outside the authoritative SNMP engine's window 
(for example, outside configured access lists or time ranges).”
 No IOS version I tested sent authentication failure traps for SNMPv3 messages with the 
wrong username, password, or Engine values. 
– Authentication failure traps were generated for SNMPv3 requests if they came from a 
source IP address that was blocked by a group access list.
– Cisco determined that this behavior is as intended. 
– CSCsz29235: The documentation for 'snmp-server enable traps snmp' command stated 
that SNMPv3 authentication failure traps can be generated, which is incorrect. The 
documentation has been updated to indicate that SNMPv3 authentication failure traps are 
not generated.
TAP-MIB – The attacker can turn the audit trail off!
