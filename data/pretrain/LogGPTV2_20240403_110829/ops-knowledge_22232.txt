I am attempting to connect to a remote machine using Python. I have utilized the `telnetlib` module and successfully connected to the machine by entering the login ID and password as follows:

```python
import telnetlib

tn = telnetlib.Telnet("HOST_IP")
tn.write(b"UID\n")
tn.write(b"PWD\n")
```

After entering the password, the terminal connects to the remote machine, which is a Linux-based system with its own IP address (referred to as `HOST_IP`).

However, when I try to execute a command, such as `cd //tmp/media/..`, it does not work. When I check the screen output using `tn.read_very_eager()`, I receive the following message:

```
\r\n\r\n\r\nBusyBox v1.19.4 (2012-07-19 22:27:43 CEST) built-in shell (ash)\r\n
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.\r\n\r\n~ #
```

This output appears to be the normal BusyBox prompt, rather than an error.

In Perl, there is a method `$telnet->cmd("cd //tmp/media/..")` to execute commands. Is there a similar method in Python? Any suggestions or examples would be greatly appreciated.

**Response:**

Thank you for providing the details. The output you are seeing is indeed the normal BusyBox prompt, which indicates that you have successfully logged into the remote machine. BusyBox is a lightweight set of Unix utilities, often used on embedded systems.

To execute commands in the remote shell, you need to ensure that each command is properly terminated with a newline character (`\n`). Additionally, you should read the output after each command to handle the response correctly.

Here is an example of how you can achieve this in Python:

```python
import telnetlib

# Connect to the remote machine
tn = telnetlib.Telnet("HOST_IP")

# Log in
tn.write(b"UID\n")
tn.write(b"PWD\n")

# Read the initial prompt
print(tn.read_until(b"~ # "))

# Execute a command
tn.write(b"cd /tmp/media/\n")

# Read the output after the command
output = tn.read_until(b"~ # ")
print(output.decode('ascii'))

# Close the connection
tn.close()
```

In this example:
- `tn.read_until(b"~ # ")` waits for the prompt to appear, ensuring that the previous command has completed.
- Each command is followed by `\n` to simulate pressing Enter.
- The output is read and printed to the console.

If the command `cd /tmp/media/` does not work as expected, ensure that the directory path is correct and that the user has the necessary permissions to access it.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
