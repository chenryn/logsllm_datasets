User: I am trying to connect a remote machine in python. I used telnetlib module and could connect to machine after entering login id and password as
tn = Telnet("HOST IP")
tn.write("UID")
tn.write("PWD")
After entering password, the terminal connects to the remote machine which is a linux based software [having its own IP address(HOST IP).]
Then after If I try to give a command e.g. tn.write("cd //tmp/media/..) to go to its various folders then it does not work and when checked to see what the screen is showing with
tn.read_very_eager()
error comes up as :
""\r\n\r\n\r\nBusyBox v1.19.4 (2012-07-19 22:27:43 CEST) built-in shell (ash)\r\n
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.\r\n\r\n~ # ""
I wanted to know if there is any method in Python as we have in PERL as $telnet->cmd ("cd //tmp/media/..)
Any suggestions are welcomed if you can give an example!!!
Assistant: You should try to login to the machine using telnet, then you will notice you will login into BusyBox. That string you print not an error it is hte normal BusyBox prompt.
It might not be what you expected, I only know BusyBox from Linux boxes that were unable to properly boot.
