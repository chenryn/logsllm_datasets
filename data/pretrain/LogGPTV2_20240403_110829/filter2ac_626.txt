title:blackhat:us-20 How I Created My Clone Using AI - Next-Gen Social Engineering
This talk is inspired by an episode of Black Mirror. I will be demonstrating a live demo creating a bot who talks like me and can be used to impersonate me online and do social engineering. I will be showing a live demo of how to a create such bots over text, voice or video and walk through various techniques which the attendees can use to create such smart social engineering attacks.I will also release my github of the AI notebooks as open source for the attendees to try out and experiment.
