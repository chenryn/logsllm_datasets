### Disclosing Private Information from Metadata, Hidden Information, and Lost Data

**Authors:** Chema Alonso, Enrique Rando, Francisco Oca, and Antonio Guzmán

**Abstract:**
Documents often contain metadata and hidden information that can be exploited to disclose private data and fingerprint an organization and its network. This paper explores the types of data that can be found, methods for extracting them, and proposes solutions to mitigate these risks.

### 1. Introduction

Collaborative work on documents necessitates the inclusion of additional information to ensure coherent and consistent results. In an environment where social networks and resource sharing are prevalent, it is essential to store information about document authors, the computers used for editing, software versions, and printers. This information can be crucial for proving authorship, reverting changes, recovering previous versions, or establishing responsibilities in legal investigations, such as digital rights management. The techniques used to attach this extra information without interfering with the content are based on metadata.

Metadata can be understood as structured information about data, which helps locate, identify, access, and manage objects. Since metadata are also data, it is possible to define metadata about metadata, which is useful when a document is the result of merging multiple documents. The primary purpose of metadata is to optimize internet searches by providing additional information for more accurate searches and filter development. Metadata also facilitate data conversion and variable presentation according to the environment.

Metadata can be classified based on content and variability. Content-based metadata describe resources and their content, while variability-based metadata can be mutable or immutable. Immutable metadata, such as file names, do not change.

Metadata generation can be manual or automatic. Manual generation can be laborious, while automatic generation uses software tools. Hybrid methods, combining both, are common. When information changes, metadata must also be updated, either automatically or manually. Managing metadata destruction is also important; sometimes, metadata should be preserved even after the resource is deleted, such as for monitoring text document changes.

The most critical issue is the preservation of metadata in final, published documents. This research focuses on the types of metadata in public documents on the internet and how they can be used for fingerprinting. We examine Microsoft Office and OpenOffice documents.

### 2. Metadata and Hidden Information in OpenOffice Documents

#### 2.1 ODF Files

ODF (Open Document Format) is the native file format for OpenOffice, an open standard defined by OASIS and approved by ISO. ODF documents are stored as compressed ZIP archives containing XML files. For example, an ODT file (text document created with OpenOffice Writer) includes:

- **meta.xml**: Contains metadata related to the document, which is not encrypted even if the document is password-protected.
- **settings.xml**: Stores document configuration and parameters.
- **content.xml**: Contains the main content of the document, i.e., the text.

**Figure 1: ODT File Contents**

Although OpenOffice version 1 uses different file extensions than version 2, the storage method is similar. ODF evolved from the file formats used in OpenOffice 1.

#### 2.2 Personal Data

Personal metadata are generated during the initial installation and execution of OpenOffice. The software asks for personal data, which, by default, will be attached to the documents created.

**Figure 2: User Data Modification**

For example, creating a new text document and checking the meta.xml file reveals information such as the OpenOffice version, operating system, and user name. Users and organizations should decide whether to show this information before publishing the document.

**Figure 3: meta.xml File**

#### 2.3 Printers

Printer data, stored in the settings.xml file, can reveal information about the company's infrastructure. When a document is printed and saved, the settings.xml file records the printer used.

**Figure 4: Printer Information in settings.xml File**

This information can be sensitive, especially if the printer is shared on a server, as it can reveal the server name and resource, potentially aiding attackers in understanding the internal network structure.

#### 2.4 Templates

Templates, used to generate documents with predefined styles and formats, store references to the template path in the meta.xml file. This path can reveal the user account and folder structure, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Figure 6: Path to Template in meta.xml File**

If the document is stored outside the user's profile, the path to the template can reveal the user account and domain information.

**Figure 7: Path to Template in User’s Profile in meta.xml File**

Similarly, if the template is located on a network server, the UNC format in the meta.xml file can provide details about the server and shared resource.

#### 2.5 Embedded and Linked Documents

Office software often allows linking and embedding documents. Linked documents include references to the linked file, which can be relative or absolute paths. If the linked document is on another computer, the information disclosed can be very useful to attackers.

**Figure 10: Linked Document**

Embedded files, such as images, can also contain metadata and hidden information. For example, a JPG image with EXIF metadata embedded in an ODF document can reveal that the image has been manipulated.

All embedded files are included in the master document. Opening the ODT file with a decompressor shows a folder called "Pictures" containing the embedded files.
