Disclosing Private Information from 
Metadata, hidden info and lost data 
Chema Alonso, Enrique Rando, Francisco Oca and Antonio Guzmán 
Abstract — Documents contain metadata and hidden information that can be used to disclose private data and to 
fingerprint an organization and its network computers. This document shows what kinds of data can be found, how to 
extract them and proposes some solutions to the problem stated here.

1 INTRODUCTION 
he collaborative work in on documents justifies the need of an extra information attached 
to the documents, in order to allow coherent and consistent results. In an environment 
where social networks make the sharing of resources such an important issue, it is 
necessary to store information about documents authors, the computers used to edit the 
documents, software versions, printers where they were printed, and so on. Then, if necessary, 
it will be possible, to prove the authorship of a concrete piece of information, to undo the last 
changes, to recover a previous version of a document or even to settle responsibilities when 
authorities want to investigate, for example, the management of the digital rights. The 
techniques used to attach this extra information to a document, without interfering with its 
content, are based on Metadata. 
The concept of Metadata can be understood as information about the data. But it can also be 
understood as a structured description, optionally available to the general public, which helps to 
locate, identify, access and manage objects. Since Metadata are themselves data, it would be 
possible to define Metadata about Metadata too. This can be very useful, for example, when a 
given document has been the result of merging two or more previous documents.  
The most frequent objective of Metadata is the optimization of Internet searches. The additional 
information provided by Metadata allows to perform more accurate searches and to simplify the 
development of filters. Therefore, Metadata emerge as a solution to human-computer 
communication, describing the content and structure of the data. Furthermore, Metadata 
facilitate further conversion to different data formats and variable data presentation according to 
the environment features. 
Metadata are classified using two different criteria: content and variability. The first classification 
is the most widely used. You can easily distinguish among Metadata used to describe a 
resource and Metadata used to describe the content of the resource. It is possible to split these 
two groups once more, for example, to separate Metadata used to describe the meaning of the 
contents from those used to describe the structure of the content; or to separate Metadata used 
to describe the resource itself from those which describe the life cycle of the resource, and so 
on. In terms of variability, on the other hand, the Metadata can be mutable or immutable. 
Obviously, the immutable Metadata do not change, a typical example would be the name of a 
file.

The generation of Metadata can be manual or automatic. The manual process can be very 
laborious, depending on the format used for the Metadata and on their desired volume. In the 
automatic generation, software tools acquire the information they need without external help. 
However, only in few cases we can have a completely automatic Metadata generation, because 
some information is very difficult to extract with software tools. The most common techniques 
use a hybrid generation that starts with the resource generation itself. 
If the information changes Metadata must change too. When the modifications are simple 
enough, they can be carried out automatically. But when the complexity increases, the 
modifications usually require the intervention of a person. In addition, the destruction of 
Metadata must be managed. In some cases, it is necessary to eliminate the Metadata along 
with their correspondent resources; in others, it is reasonable to preserve the Metadata after the 
resource destruction, for example, to monitor changes in a text document. 
But the most critical situation is the destruction of Metadata when they are related to a final 
resource version intended for publication. The main contribution of this work is a research about 
what kind of information stored as Metadata in the public documents on the Internet is not 
destroyed and how this information can be used as a basis for fingerprinting techniques. We 
have selected two kinds of documents very usual on the web: Microsoft Office documents and 
OpenOffice documents. 
2 METADATA AND HIDDEN INFORMATION IN OPENOFFICE DOCUMENTS 
2.1 ODF FILES 
ODF (Open Document Format) is the native file format used by OpenOffice, an open standard 
format, defined by OASIS and approved by ISO. In ODF, documents are stored as compressed 
ZIP archives containing a set of XML files with the document contents. If you use compression 
software to open an ODT document (text file created with OpenOffice Writer) you can find the 
following files: 
• 
meta.xml: Metadata related to the document. This file is not encrypted even if the 
document is password protected. 
• 
settings.xml: Information related to the document configuration and parameters. 
• 
content.xml: File with the main content of the document, therefore, the text. 
Figure 1: ODT file contents

Although OpenOffice version 1 uses different file extensions than OpenOffice 2, documents are 
stored in a similar way in both versions. Do not forget that ODF was built as an evolution of the 
file formats used in OpenOffice 1. 
2.2 PERSONAL DATA 
The first metadata generated using OpenOffice are created during the software installation and 
first execution. The software suite asks the user a set of personal data which, by default, will be 
attached to the documents created with this software. 
Figure 2: User data modification 
Some of these data will be stored within the documents created by OpenOffice. If we create a 
new text document and afterwards check the contents of the generated meta.xml file, we will 
find the following information:

Figure 3: meta.xml file 
We can find information about the OpenOffice version, the operating system, and, within 
personal data, about the user name. Perhaps we want to show this information or maybe not. A 
user or a company should decide about it before publishing the document on the Internet, 
before mailing it or before making it public by any other method.

2.3 PRINTERS 
Among the data that can be potentially dangerous, because it reveals information about the 
company infrastructure, we have printer data. When you print a document with OpenOffice, and 
after it, you save the document; its settings.xml file stores information about the printer that has 
been used.

Figure 4: printer information in settings.xml file 
This information may be important because it can denounce a forbidden action performed by a 
user or point directly to a specific user or machine uniquely. In terms of security this information 
could be even worse if the printer is shared on a server: 
… 
false  
  false  
  false  
  \\servidor\HP 2000C 
  false  
  false 
… 
Figure 5: Printer information described in UNC format in settings.xml file 
In this case, the printer appears in UNC format (Universal Naming Service), revealing both the 
server name and the correspondent resource. These data, for example, could be used by 
attackers to know the infrastructure of the internal network and to create a list of possible 
targets. 
2.5 TEMPLATES 
Templates are used to generate documents with predefined styles and formats. They are widely 
used because they allow using corporate documents and images comfortably. However, when a 
document is generated from a template, it stores references to the path location of the template 
in the meta.xml file:

Figure 6: Path to template in meta.xml file 
In the meta.xml file you can see the path to the template relative to the document location. This 
path may seem harmless and lacking the information that could put the system security at risk. 
However, if the document is stored in a folder located outside the user's profile, this path offers 
information about the user account. 
... 
... 
Figure 7: Path to template in user’s profile in meta.xml file 
In this case, the document has been stored in "C: \" and as a result, the path to the template 
reveals the folder that contains the user's profile in "C: \ Documents and Settings". The name of 
this folder is usually the name of the user account, in this example "UserAccount." It should be 
noted that, in certain cases, the name of this folder contains data about the domain to which the 
user belongs. This information is usually included in the name of the folder with the user's profile 
with the structure "UserAccount.DomainName" offering critical information to a potential 
attacker. 
Similarly, the document could have been saved on another drive different from the template, 
obtaining in this case a complete path to identify the disk drive: 
…

Figure 8: Full path to template in meta.xml file 
Examples shown above have all been performed on Windows machines, but the results do not 
differ much in Linux machines. In this case, paths to templates can contain information about 
user’s $HOME Path: 
… 
…
Figure 9: Full path to template related to $HOME in meta.xml file 
Logically, if the template is located on a network server, the information in UNC format shows 
the server’s name and the shared resource, again allowing a potential attacker to reconstruct 
the network structure of the organization.

2.6 EMBEDDED AND LINKED DOCUMENTS 
One of the options provided by almost all of the current office software is linking and embedding 
documents. In the case of linking files, there is a reference to the linked document in the main 
document, in the form of a relative path, when it is possible, and as an absolute path when there 
is no other alternative. If the document is linked on the same computer where the main 
document is, the result will be, in general, similar the results shown in the last section. 
Therefore, a potential attacker could disclose sensitive information about user accounts or file 
locations.  
If the linked document is stored on another computer, the information disclosed to the attacker 
is very useful again:

Figure 10: Linked document 
When the file is embedded in the document, not linked, there are not routes implied in the 
process, but we have to face new potential problems of leakage of information, because they 
may contain metadata and hidden information. 
Suppose that we embed a JPG image (with its metadata in EXIF format) in an ODF document. 
In the example, one of such EXIF metadata is a miniature that looks different from the 
embedded image, thus showing that the image has been manipulated. 
All the embedded files are included in the master document, so opening the ODT file with a 
decompressor, you can see that there is a folder called Pictures, and inside it is the embedded
