Question: "When using RSA keys in an Android Keymaster for unpadded signing operations, which of the following measures should be taken if the provided data is shorter than the key's length?"
 "A": "The data should be left zero-padded on the right before signing."
 "B": "The data should be left zero-padded on the left before signing."
 "C": "The operation should proceed without padding, as the input length is irrelevant."
 "D": "The data should be rejected and the operation aborted, as RSA keys require data to match their length exactly."
Answer: B
