1: go version go1.5.1 darwin/amd64  
2: OSX 10.11 MacPro6,1Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5  
3: Minimal program to create an invalid go binary on OSX using codesign tool.
    package main
    import "C" // Delete this line and codesign'd binary works.
    func main() {
        println("Hello OSX.")
    }
    ~/code/src/ttt: go build
    ~/code/src/ttt: ./ttt
    Hello OSX.
    ~/code/src/ttt: codesign -s "Developer ID Application: Name" ttt
    ~/code/src/ttt: ./ttt
    Killed: 9
4: The program should run successfully after code signing. This used to work
prior to OSX 10.11.  
5: All of my OSX Go products depend on Cgo. Still looking for a workaround.  
Possibly related to issue #12700
