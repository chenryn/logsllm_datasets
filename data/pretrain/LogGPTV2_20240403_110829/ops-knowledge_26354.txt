User: Please explain DNS (Domain Name System, Domain Name System) and its importance and role in the Internet.
Assistant: DNS (Domain Name System, Domain Name System) is a distributed database system that converts domain names (such as google.com) into IP addresses (such as 216.58.194.78). It acts as a "phone book" on the Internet, and is used to map easy-to-remember domain names and IP addresses, making it easier for users to access and use the Internet. The DNS system consists of hundreds of thousands of DNS servers distributed in different regions of the world. They cooperate with each other to ensure the efficient, reliable and stable operation of Internet services. DNS plays a vital role in the Internet. For example, when a user enters a web address in a browser, the browser will request the DNS server to obtain the IP address corresponding to the domain name. The DNS server then returns this address to the browser, allowing it to successfully connect to the website and display the page. Similarly, various Internet services such as e-mail, file sharing, and video streaming all require DNS to complete the resolution of domain names to IP addresses. Since DNS is one of the fundamental protocols in the Internet, its reliability and security are crucial to ensure smooth and reliable network operations.
