User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SSH: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-with-mic,password) ====================================================================

UPDATE: 
It turned out the configuration of sshd on host2 wont allow password
login. Thanks to people answered this.

====================================================================

Scenario: 
Working with a company for my college project. 
I need to use PuTTy to SSH into host1 first, and  from there SSH into host2 (see below).
I was given a username and password on host2.

I do not have access of host2 at all, so I have no knowledge of its sshd_config. 

This is what happened when I was trying to SSH into host2 from host1 :

ff@host1:~$ ssh -v host2

I wonder is there anything I can do before go to the company.

Assistant: The username and password you are trying are not accepted by the host. That means either you are connecting to the wrong server, or the username or password is incorrect. You should ask the administrator to check the logs on host2, that should tell you which of the three is the case.
