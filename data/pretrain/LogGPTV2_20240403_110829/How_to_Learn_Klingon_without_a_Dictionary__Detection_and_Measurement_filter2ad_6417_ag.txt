### Appendix

#### A. Background about Search Ads

Search engine marketing (SEM) is the primary revenue source for search engines, allowing site owners to increase visibility through paid advertisements. Unlike organic search results, which are ranked based on site importance and relevance, the rankings of paid sites (search ads) primarily depend on the amount spent. For newer sites with limited reputation, SEM offers a quick way to boost traffic. There are four main types of SEM products:
- **Paid Inclusion**: Pay to be included in the search index.
- **Paid Placement**: Similar to paid inclusion but guarantees top rankings.
- **Local Search Ads**: Sites are displayed when users are in or querying specific locations.
- **Product Listing Ads**: Ads from merchants that include product images and prices.

Site owners select relevant keywords and bid on them, paying based on the number and quality of clicks their ads receive. To maintain their reputation, search engines check the relevance and quality of the ads, ensuring they match the targeted keywords and landing pages. However, black keywords can still be used, and we have identified several such cases (described in Section V-C).

#### B. URL Scanner

The URL scanner integrated into KDES runs on Hadoop + MapReduce and uses multiple detectors to evaluate URLs. The label of a URL is determined by the combined results from these detectors. The scanning process is divided into three phases:
1. **Blacklist Check**: The URL is checked against a blacklist of URLs and domains.
2. **Real-Time Detectors**:
   - **Rule-Based Detector**: Checks for known black keywords and their frequencies.
   - **Algorithm-Based Detector**: Renders the page to spot suspicious behaviors and analyzes images for pornographic content.
   - **Model-Based Detector**: Classifies the page using machine learning models.
3. **Spider-Pool Detector**: Checks if the page is built for blackhat SEO purposes. Detected URLs and domains are added to the blacklist.

#### C. Registration and IP Information of Sites Selling Drugs

We queried the IP and location information of sites selling drugs, as listed in Table XIV. Half of the sites are located in Hong Kong, and half in mainland China. Five sites share the same IP address.

#### D. Payment Methods of Sites Selling Drug Equipment

Table XV lists the payment methods accepted by these sites, including Alipay, Tenpay, Haipay, online banking, wired transfer, and cash on delivery.
