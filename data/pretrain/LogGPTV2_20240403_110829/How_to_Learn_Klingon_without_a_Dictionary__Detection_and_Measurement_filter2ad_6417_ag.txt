A. Background about search ads
APPENDIX
Search engine marketing (SEM) is the major revenue source
for a search engine. It allows site owners to increase visibility
through payment. Different from organic search results whose
ranks are determined by sites’ importance and relevance, the
rankings of the paid sites (i.e., search ads) mostly depend on
the amount of spendings. To the newer sites whose reputations
have not been accumulated, SEM is a convenient approach to
boost incoming trafﬁc in a short time. So far, four types of
SEM products are offered, including paid inclusion (pay to
be included in search index), paid placement (similar to paid
inclusion but top rankings are guaranteed), local search ads
(sites are shown when users are residing in or querying speciﬁc
locations) and product listing ads (ads from merchants allowing
display of product image and price) [64]. Typically, site owners
choose a list of keywords which are relevant to their business
as target. For example, a ﬂower store might target the terms
“roses”, “cheap bouquet” or “wedding ﬂowers”. Then they bid
on these keywords and make payments based on the number
and quality of clicks going through their ads [10], [65].
To avoid dampening its reputation, the search engine checks
whether the search ad is relevant to the targeted keywords, ad’s
quality and the consistency between ad and landing page. Ads
failing these basic checks will be asked for adjustment, but ads
promoting illegal products are rejected without consideration.
However, due to the freedom granted by search engines
in keywords selection, promotion under black keywords is
possible and we have identiﬁed several such cases (described
in Section V-C). As one example, surprisingly, we found spider
pool services are listed in Baidu’s search ads (see Figure 12),
and this happens because the marketing personnels are not
aware that spider pool belongs to the underground economy,
as we learned from them. Auditing the sites behind the search
ads is not a promising solution, as adversaries could apply
cloaking techniques to conceal the real content. To mitigate
this issue, our approach provides an alternative solution which
could signiﬁcantly reduce the delay for discovering illegal
search ads.
B. URL scanner
The scanner we integrated into KDES runs on Hadoop +
MapReduce and uses multiple detectors against a URL. The
label of the URL is determined by the combined results from
the detectors. Figure 14 illustrates how the detectors work

together. We divide the scanning process into 3 phases. In the
ﬁrst phase, the URL is checked against a blacklist of URLs
and domains. If the URL is not alarmed, the page of the
URL will be fetched and checked by three real-time detectors
running sequentially, including rule-based, algorithm-based
and model-based detectors. Rule-based detector checks the
existence of known black keywords and their frequencies on
the page. To notice, the new black keywords identiﬁed by
KDES will be imported to this detector after conﬁrmed by the
analysts. Algorithm-based detector renders the page to spot the
suspicious behaviors and analyzes all images to capture the
porn ones. Model-based detector classiﬁes the page based on a
set of models trained through machine learning. The result of
this phase depends on the output of all the three detectors. The
ﬁnal phase consists of the spider-pool detector which checks
whether the page is built for blackhat SEO purposes. The URLs
and their enclosed domains are added to the blacklist used by
the ﬁrst phase in the end.
C. Registration and IP information of sites selling drugs
We queried IP and location of these sites that sold drugs, and
list them in Table XIV. From this table we can see that half
of them are located in HongKong, and half in China mainland.
There are 5 sites sharing the same IP.
