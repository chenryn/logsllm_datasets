I am having a lot of situations in which I am depending on some module from
multiple files. I end up with the multiple occurances of that module in the
output bundle, each of which has different id's. I would expect this module to
occur once which is what I also need because most of these are singletons
whose state I need accross the application.
So far I don't have any good starting point. Are there any typical causes for
this?
