I am encountering a situation where I rely on a specific module across multiple files. As a result, the output bundle contains multiple instances of this module, each with a unique identifier. Ideally, I would like this module to be included only once in the bundle, as most of these modules are singletons, and I need their state to be consistent throughout the application.

So far, I haven't found a good starting point to resolve this issue. Are there any common causes for this behavior, and how can I address it?
