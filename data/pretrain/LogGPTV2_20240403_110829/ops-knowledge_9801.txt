User: I've been learning Python for a project required for work.  We are starting up a new server that will be running linux, and need a python script to run that will monitor a folder and handle files when they are placed in the folder.
I have the python "app" working, but I'm having a hard time finding how to make this script run when the server is started.  I know it's something simple, but my linux knowledge falls short here.
Secondary question:  As I understand it I don't need to compile or install this application, basically just call the start script to run it.  Is that correct?
Assistant: You can set up the script to run via cron, configuring time as @reboot
With python scripts, you will not need to compile it. You might need to install it, depending on what assumptions your script makes about its environment.
