**Title: Fault-Injection Detection Circuits: Design, Calibration, Validation, and Tuning**

This session will delve into the tunable replica circuit (TRC), a fault-injection detection circuit that has been integrated into the Intel® Converged Security and Management Engine (Intel® CSME) in the 12th Gen Intel® Core™ Processor. This marks Intel's first foray into active fault-injection attack detection in high-volume products such as CPUs and chipsets.

Fault-injection attacks often aim to induce timing failures, which can lead to the execution of unsigned code on security engines. The TRC is designed to explicitly detect these timing failures, offering a more robust solution compared to traditional analog voltage and clock monitors. It can identify timing issues resulting from various types of glitch attacks, including those caused by voltage, clock, temperature, and electromagnetic radiation.

The session will cover several key aspects:
- **Introduction to TRC Technology:** An overview of the TRC and its role in fault-injection detection.
- **Integration into Intel CSME:** How the TRC was incorporated into the Intel CSME to enhance security.
- **Calibration in High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM):** The process and challenges involved in calibrating the TRC during mass production.
- **Testing and Validation:** Details on the false-positive and fault-injection testing conducted in Intel's physical attack labs.

By the end of the session, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of the TRC and its significance in enhancing the security of client security engines.
