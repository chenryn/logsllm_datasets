Our obtained dataset contains 587,653 Quora questions.
Of these, 437,622 (74.47%) have at least one answer, and
563,954 (95.97%) have at least one follower. The number of
Quora questions containing at least one anonymous answer
is 138,576 (23.58%), while number of questions with at least
one anonymous follower is 336,551 (57.27%). Since the effort

such as sex, religion, etc., but also suggest themes outside of
the typical set as potentially sensitive. In addition to identifying
topics that are considered potentially sensitive by Quora users,
our ﬁndings lend support to the feasibility of our proposed
approach – identifying user sensitivities and privacy preferences
via behavioral data analysis of users’ use of privacy-enhancing
product features.
A. Measuring Context-level and Topic-level Anonymity Ratios
In our ﬁrst methodology, we measure a topic’s sensitivity
level by considering all questions belonging to the topic and
computing the fraction of answers to those questions that
are anonymous among the total number of answers posted
for those questions. We perform this analysis separately for
Quora topics and Quora contexts. We choose to use the Quora-
assigned topics and contexts, rather than classify the questions
and answers into our own topic hierarchy, because Quora’s
human moderators have spent signiﬁcant effort in order to
hand-label each of the questions with a corresponding context
or set of topics, and thus we expect their label quality to be
higher than what can be derived based on a short snippet via
unsupervised machine learning techniques. We exclude topics
and contexts for which we do not have sufﬁcient data from
consideration in order to avoid making erroneous conclusions.
We also exclude questions that did not receive a single answer
from consideration in all our analyses, as they do not provide
information about the anonymity/non-anonymity user choices
that are of interest for this research.
1) Context Data: There are 21,232 contexts on Quora that
have at least 1 question with at least 1 answer and at least 1
follower3. The average number of questions per context among
these is 10.85, so we consider only the most popular contexts,
i.e., those that have at least 11 questions, in our analysis. The
3,129 contexts with at least 11 questions belonging to them
contain 188,121 questions with a total of 512,225 answers,
86,213 of which are anonymous, suggesting a 0.17 overall
anonymity rate. We further limit our analysis to the 1,525
contexts that, in addition to being comprised of at least 11
questions each, contain at least 66 answers. The motivation
for choosing contexts with at least 6 answers per question on
average stems from the desire to focus on contexts that have
generated sufﬁcient engagement. Additionally, a question with
6 answers one of which is anonymous, has an anonymity rate of
0.17, which is the overall average anonymity rate for contexts
with 11 questions; furthermore, a question with 6 answers two
of which are anonymous, would have an anonymity rate of
more than twice the average, enabling even the discrete answer
counts to distinguish between average and above average [43].
These 1,525 contexts have a total of 159,884 questions with
452,221 answers, 76,947 of which are anonymous.
For each context C of the 1,525 contexts that contain at least
11 questions and at least 66 answers, we compute its answer
anonymity ratio, A(C), as the fraction of anonymous answers
3A large number of questions, 256,270, are not labeled with any context
and are, therefore, excluded from this part of the analysis.

required to answer a question is signiﬁcantly higher than the
effort required to follow a question, and, furthermore, answering
a question requires some knowledge about the question’s
topic, whereas following a question is merely an expression
of curiosity or interest about it and its potential answers, it is
not surprising that there are more questions with at least one
follower than with at least one answer.
The distribution of the number of answers and anonymous
answers for questions in our dataset is shown in Figure 2; the
x-axis shows the number of answers or anonymous answers and
the y-axis – the number of questions with that many answers
(in log scale). The ﬁgure omits a handful of questions that have
more than 100 answers for readability. The question with the
most answers and the most anonymous answers in our dataset
“What is the most useful, shortest, and generally applicable
piece of wisdom?”1 has 440 answers, 73 of them anonymous.
The distribution of the number of followers for the questions
in our collected dataset is shown in Figure 3; the x-axis shows
the number of followers or anonymous followers and the y-axis
– the number of questions with that many followers2.
IV. SENSITIVE CONTEXTS AND TOPICS
In this section, we present two methodologies for identifying
which contexts and topics may be more sensitive than others
based on Quora user anonymity actions. Both approaches give
support for sensitivity of topics typically considered sensitive,

2) Context-Based Results: Our ﬁndings are presented in
Table I and Figure 4. The former presents statistics for those
14 contexts whose answer anonymity ratio, A(C), is three
standard deviations above the mean, while the latter lists the
top 100 Quora contexts in the decreasing order of their A(C)s.
We manually analyze each of the 243 contexts whose answer
anonymity ratio exceeds one standard deviation above the
average. For each context we attempt to assess whether it
belongs to one of the typically considered sensitive categories,
and if not, identify its broader theme. We do so by hiring 5
workers4 and tasking them with labeling each context with
one or two of the most appropriate 41 themes we provide
(or “None”). The themes we provide are comprised of the
top-level content themes utilized by Google AdWords5 and
the categories typically considered sensitive as described in

Section II-A.
Several observations based on this analysis strike us as
noteworthy. First, the majority of sensitive categories described
by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and CNIL, such as racial or
ethnic origins; political, philosophical, or religious beliefs;
sexual orientation or sex life; gender identity; disability
or medical condition (including physical or mental health);
ﬁnancial status or information; dating/personals; weapons,
have supporting evidence among the selected Quora contexts.
For example, supporting evidence for the sensitivity of ﬁnancial
information are contexts such as Salaries, Taxes, Investment
Banking and American Express. The only exception for which
we did not ﬁnd supporting evidence among the ones used by
these four entities is: criminal record. The absence of evidence
in favor of this is likely due to selection biases among Quora
users and questions.
Second, as is visually clear from Figure 4, which distin-
guishes the contexts that belong to typically considered sensitive
categories (as judged by at least two workers) from those that do
not, although several of the contexts with the highest anonymity
ratio belong to the categories of data typically considered
sensitive, many do not. Speciﬁcally, 120 contexts out of 243
considered, were not associated with a conventional sensitive
category by any worker. We loosely group the contexts whose
answer anonymity ratio exceeds one standard deviation but do
not belong to any of the conventionally considered sensitive
categories into themes, and present the themes and the contexts
supportive of them in Table II.
Our ﬁndings based on this analysis methodology support
the hypothesis that data sensitivity is quite nuanced, and that
sensitive topics include but are not limited to the ones typically
considered.
3) Topic data: We repeat a similar analysis to the one
performed for Quora contexts above, for Quora topics. Specif-
ically, there are 53,551 topics on Quora that have at least 1
question with at least 1 answer and at least 1 follower. The
average number of questions per topic is 22.6, larger than the
average per context, since each question is labeled with at
most one context but may be labeled with many topics. We
consider only the most popular topics, i.e., those that have
at least 23 questions, in our analysis. The 6,799 topics with
at least 23 questions each, contain 418,575 questions with a
total of 1,027,549 answers, 178,038 of which are anonymous,
suggesting 0.17 overall anonymity rate. We further limit our
analysis to the 4,067 topics that, in addition to being comprised
of at least 23 questions each, contain at least 138 answers, i.e.,
on average, 6 answers per question, as in the analysis above.
These 4,067 topics have a total of 408,828 questions with a
total of 1,014,300 answers, 175,986 of which are anonymous.
For each topic T of the 4,067 topics that contain at least
23 questions and at least 138 answers, we compute its answer
anonymity ratio, A(T ), as the fraction of anonymous answers
received to questions within that topic to the total number of
answers received to questions within that topic. Similarly, we
compute its follower anonymity ratio, F (T ), as the fraction of
anonymous followers among the total number of followers. We
