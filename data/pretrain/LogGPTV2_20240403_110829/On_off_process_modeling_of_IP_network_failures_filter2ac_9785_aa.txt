# Abstract
This paper presents a reliability model for IP networks, using on/off processes to represent the operational states of routers and links. The model accounts for routing rules and network topology, enabling the derivation of on/off processes that describe the availability of each access router. This approach also provides risk estimates in terms of lost traffic and allows for analytical comparisons of different strategies for network improvement. The methodology is illustrated through a case study of the Finnish research backbone network, demonstrating high-accuracy modeling with Pareto-distributed component downtimes.

# 1. Introduction
Network reliability analysis typically involves two aspects: proactive and reactive strategies. Proactive measures aim to prevent failures, while reactive measures address them after they occur. Our modeling approach considers both the physical network topology and the stochastic behavior of components, such as routers and links. By using on/off processes, we can model the random downtimes of these components, which can follow any probability distribution, including Pareto distributions. This method extends previous work [9, 8] and provides a more comprehensive framework for analyzing network reliability. Our approach also supports the evaluation of service level agreements (SLAs) by estimating the risks associated with traffic losses.

# 2. Reliability Modeling with Stationary On/Off Processes
In this section, we introduce the mathematical framework for modeling network reliability using stationary on/off processes. Each component (e.g., a router or link) is represented by a binary-valued process, where 1 indicates the "on" state and 0 indicates the "off" state. The on and off periods are modeled as independent, stationary, and ergodic processes. We use Palm theory to derive the statistical properties of these processes, such as the mean uptime and downtime. The key advantage of this approach is its ability to handle general distributions, including heavy-tailed ones like the Pareto distribution.

# 3. Poisson-Pareto Modeling
To further specify the model, we assume that the on-times follow exponential distributions, while the off-times follow Pareto distributions. This choice is motivated by the need to capture the high variability in downtime lengths, which is supported by empirical data. The Pareto distribution is parameterized by a minimum duration \( m_i \) and a shape parameter \( \alpha_i \). The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Pareto distribution is given by:
\[ P(T > t) = \left(\frac{m_i}{t}\right)^{\alpha_i}, \quad \text{for} \; t > m_i. \]

# 4. Modeling of Local IP Availability
### 4.1. On/Off Modeling of Two-Component Failures
We extend the on/off process model to consider simultaneous failures of two components. This is particularly relevant for IP networks, where a single point of failure can lead to significant disruptions. By combining the on/off processes of individual components, we can derive an approximate model for the local IP availability at each access router. This model takes into account the topological structure and routing rules of the network.

### 4.2. Topology and Network Failure Events
The network topology and routing rules play a crucial role in determining the impact of component failures. We define a structural function that specifies which components' failures constitute a network failure event and which customers are affected. This function is essential for assessing the functional connectivity and availability of the network. For example, a network may be considered to have failed if it is no longer connected to the Internet, even if some internal components are still operational.

# 5. Case Study: Finnish Research Backbone Network
We apply our modeling approach to the Finnish research backbone network, Funet. Despite limited data on link and core router downtimes, we use ping data to estimate the on/off processes. By combining topological and stochastic modeling, we derive an approximate on/off model for each access router. This model allows us to compute the local IP availability and compare different strategies for network improvement. The results show considerable differences in distribution and provide valuable insights for SLA management and cost estimation.

# 6. Conclusions
This paper presents a comprehensive reliability model for IP networks using on/off processes. The model accounts for the stochastic behavior of components and the topological structure of the network. By incorporating Pareto-distributed downtimes, we provide a more realistic and flexible framework for network reliability analysis. The case study on the Finnish research backbone network demonstrates the practical utility of this approach, offering valuable insights for network operators and service providers.
