User: How to use Git for version control and collaborative development?
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system that supports multi-person collaborative development. The following are the basic steps for using Git to implement version control and collaborative development: 1. Install Git: First, you need to install Git on your computer. If it is a Windows system, you can download and install Git for Windows. If it is a Mac or Linux system, you can install Git through the package manager. 2. Create a warehouse: To use Git for version control, you need to create a warehouse. You can use GitHub, GitLab and other platforms to create warehouses online, or use the command line to create warehouses locally. 3. Clone warehouse: If collaborative development is required, the warehouse needs to be cloned locally. You can use the command line to execute the "git clone [warehouse address]" command, or you can clone in the Git tool interface. 4. Add and submit code: After developing the code locally, you need to use the "git add [file name]" command to add the code to the temporary storage area, and then use the "git commit -m [commit information]" command to submit. 5. Push to remote warehouse: If you need to share code or carry out collaborative development, you can use the "git push" command to push the local code to the remote warehouse, and notify other collaborators to update. 6. Pulling updates: In the process of multi-person collaborative development, you need to use the "git pull" command to pull the latest updates from the remote warehouse to the local for merging. 7. Conflict resolution: Conflicts may arise during code merging, and conflicts need to be resolved and the code resubmitted. 8. Branch management: Git supports creating branches for code development. You can use the "git branch" command to create branches, the "git checkout" command to switch branches, and the "git merge" command to merge branches. The above are the basic processes and commands for using Git to implement version control and collaborative development. In actual use, you need to master more advanced commands and skills.
