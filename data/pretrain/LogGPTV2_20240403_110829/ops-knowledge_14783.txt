User: How to centrally manage user accounts and permissions of multiple servers?
Assistant: There are several ways to centrally manage user accounts and permissions of multiple servers: 1. Use LDAP or Active Directory: Centrally manage user accounts and permissions through LDAP or Active Directory, which can facilitate unified management of multiple servers. Using the same LDAP or Active Directory authentication service on multiple servers allows users to log in to multiple servers with only one account. 2. Use configuration management tools: Configuration management tools can automatically manage the configuration on the server, including user accounts and permissions. For example, use Ansible or Puppet to automatically configure user accounts and permissions on servers by defining Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Playbooks. 3. Use the springboard machine: the springboard machine is a secure server used to connect to other servers. Through the springboard machine, administrators can control user permissions and access on multiple servers. Maintaining user accounts and permissions on the springboard machine can manage multiple servers more securely. 4. Use solutions from cloud service providers: Some cloud service providers provide solutions for centrally managing user accounts and permissions on multiple servers. For example, AWS provides AWS IAM, which can centrally manage user accounts and permissions of multiple EC2 instances. In short, the above method can make it easier for administrators to centrally manage user accounts and permissions of multiple servers, improve management efficiency and ensure security.
