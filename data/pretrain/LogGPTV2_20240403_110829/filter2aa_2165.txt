### The Problem
- **Complex Data Formats:** These formats are often difficult to understand.
- **Lack of Understanding:** Either we are not supposed to or are unwilling to understand these formats.
- **Covert Channels:** Such channels can exist in various data formats, leading to potential security risks.

### Examples and Incidents

#### Mail and News Headers
- **RFC 822 and Related Standards:** While well-known in the technical community, they remain a mystery to the general public.
- **Potential Data Leakage:** Information such as operating system, IP address, server, software versions, organization, time, ISP customer number, and even telephone numbers can be included.

#### T-Online Incident
- **Details:** [Insert specific details about the T-Online incident]

#### Configuration Files
- **Security Issue:** Misunderstood configuration files can pose significant security risks.
- **Information Disclosure:** They can also inadvertently disclose sensitive information.

#### Apache and BitchX Incidents
- **Apache:** [Insert specific details]
- **BitchX:** [Insert specific details]

#### HTML
- **Complexity:** Complex programs generate intricate HTML code.
- **Obvious Indicators:**
  - META generator tags
  - Paths to local files

#### Defaced Web Pages
- **Incident:** [Insert specific details about defaced web pages, e.g., attrition.org]

#### PDF
- **Open Standard Myth:** PDFs are often considered an open standard but are very challenging to decode thoroughly.
- **Censorship/Redaction Issues:** Redacting sensitive information in PDFs can be problematic.

#### Exploiting Hidden Data
- **Techniques:**
  - Copying black text on a black background
  - Extracting underlying graphics

#### Notable Incidents
- **Sniper Letter**
- **The Justice Department's Attorney Workforce Diversity Study**
- **"Secrets of History: The C.I.A. in Iran"**

#### Microsoft Office
- **Complexity and Lack of Documentation:** The MS Office document format is highly complex, undocumented, and frequently changes.
- **Documented Incidents:**
  - Text from unrelated documents appearing in the file
  - Deleted or overwritten data reappearing in the file

#### Specific Incidents
- **UK Iraq Dossier**
- **Transrapid / Rheinbraun / Management / Feasibility Study**
- **Melissa Virus**

#### JPEG/EXIF
- **Comment Fields:** Many image formats, including JPEG, contain comment fields that can disclose unwanted data.
- **EXIF Metadata:** JPEG images use the EXIF format for metadata.
- **Notable Incident:** [Insert specific details about the EXIF thumbnail incident]

#### Miscellaneous
- **Starr Report**
- **Embedded Serials/GUIDs**
- **Unregistered Marks**
- **Other Cases:**

### An Experiment
- **Idea:**
  - Crawl the web
  - Download documents
  - Identify those containing hidden data
- **Challenge:**
  - How to detect hidden data effectively?

#### The Byers Experiment
- **Title:** Scalable Exploitation of, and Responses to Information Leakage Through Hidden Data in Published Documents
- **Author:** Simon Byers
- **Publication:** IEEE Security & Privacy, pp. 23-27, March/April 2004

#### Our Experiment
- **Technical Details and Demonstration:**

### Conclusions
- **Proprietary Formats:** You never know what hidden data they may carry.
- **Open Formats:** While beneficial, they are only part of the solution.
- **Web Crawling:** Continuously spider the web and analyze the results.
