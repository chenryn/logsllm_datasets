The Problem
• Complex Dataformats
• We are not supposed to understand
• or we are not willing to understand
• Covert channels everywhere!

Examples

Mail- & News-Headers
• RfC 822 and friends are well known in the 
techie community but a mystery to 
everybody else.
• Data in there possibly include: OS, IP, 
server, software and their versions, 
organisation, time, customer number at isp 
/ telephone number (!), etc.

Incidents
• T-Online

Conﬁg Files
• Conﬁg ﬁles which are not well understood 
are a security issue...
•  ... but also can result in disclosure of 
information which is not to be disclosed

Incidents
• Apache
• BitchX

HTML
• Complex programs generate complex 
HTML
• Most obvious:
• META generator
• Paths to local ﬁles

Incidents
• Defaced web pages (attrition.org)

PDF
• Looks like an “open standard” ...
• ... but very hard to decode in depth
• The Problem of censorship / redaction.

Exploiting hidden data
• Copy black text on black ground
• Copy underlying graphics

Incidents
• Sniper Letter
• The Justice Dept's Attorney Workforce 
Diversity Study
• "Secrets of History: The C.I.A. in Iran"

MS Ofﬁce
• The MS Ofﬁce document format is 
incredibly complex, undocumented and 
ever changing

• Documented incidents include:
• Text from a completely unrelated 
document edited before appears in the 
ﬁle.
• Data deleted from the document or 
overwritten is appears in the ﬁle.

Incidents
• UK Irak Dossier
• Transrapid / Rheinbraun / Managment / 
Machbarkeitsstudie
• Melissa

JPEG/EXIF
• Many image formats contain comment 
ﬁelds which might disclose unwanted data.
• JPEG has the extensible EXIF format for 
meta data.
• There was a remarkable incident with EXIF 
thumbnails

An Experiment
• Idea
• Crawl the Web
• Download Documents
• Find the ones with hidden data.
• Problem:
• How to detect hidden data?

The Byers Experiment
• Scalable Exploitation of, and Responses to 
Information Leakage Through Hidden Data 
in Published Documents, Simon Byers, IEEE 
Security & Privacy pp. 23-27, March / April 
2004

Conclusions
• You never know what properitary formats 
carry
• Open formats are only part of a solution
• Spider the web and enjoy
