Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the template extraction:

**Log Line:**
```
Connection request from old client /10.10.34.25:58975; will be dropped if server is in r-o mode
```

**Template:**
```
Connection request from old client /<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>; will be dropped if server is in r-o mode
```

In this template:
- `<IP_ADDRESS>` represents the IP address (e.g., `10.10.34.25`).
- `<PORT>` represents the port number (e.g., `58975`).
