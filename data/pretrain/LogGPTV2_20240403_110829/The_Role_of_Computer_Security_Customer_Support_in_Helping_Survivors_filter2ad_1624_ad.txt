Table 2), all but two identiﬁed as men. The majority had been
in the industry for 5+ years. Half of our participants were
directors or managers; the rest held diverse roles. While re-
searcher and content writer might sound irrelevant to customer
support, both participants mentioned experiences with tech-
enabled abuse cases in initial email exchanges and contributed
relevant insights in the focus groups.
Study protocol. We conducted focus groups remotely over
video chat since participants were geographically dispersed.
We synthesized our results from Section 4 into a presentation
in ﬁve parts to guide the discussion (see Appendix B).

Table 2: Demographics and job roles of participating customer
support practitioners.
In Part 1, we explored participants’ backgrounds, their com-
pany’s customer support organizational structures, and metrics
for measuring success. We also asked if participants had en-
countered tech-enabled IPV cases in their roles (either person-
ally or through a team member) and any company initiatives to
support IPV survivors. In Parts 2–4, we presented summaries
of IPV professionals’ suggestions: how to interact with sur-
vivors (Section 4.2), the responsibilities of support agents
(Section 4.3), and how to refer survivors (Section 4.4). In Part
5, we elicited feedback on IPV professionals’ suggestions
for training components (e.g., common types of tech-enabled
abuse, trauma-informed responses, and secondary trauma).
Each part contained speciﬁc examples and quotes from our
focus groups with IPV professionals. We invited participants
to freely share their reactions and thoughts on the value, cost,
feasibility, and challenges of putting the suggestions into prac-
tice. Similar to our method in Section 4.1, we used probes to
elicit different opinions and encouraged participants to engage
with each others’ ideas.
Qualitative data analysis. We used inductive coding [65]
to analyze focus group transcripts. Our coding process was
similar to Section 4.1: two researchers independently coded
two transcripts, compared differences, created a consistent
codebook, applied the codebook to the remaining transcripts
separately, and reviewed all coded transcripts together. Our
ﬁnal codebook (see Appendix C.2) has 49 codes and covered
topics such as customer support’s existing practices, reactions
to IPV professionals’ suggestions, challenges of implementa-
tion, and new ideas for supporting IPV survivors.
5.2 Well-Received Suggestions
Practitioners agreed on the importance of assisting IPV sur-
vivors and training frontline agents for this purpose. Practi-
tioners also endorsed the idea of providing and sharing tech
safety resources, which they had been doing to some extent.
Existing practices to support survivors. Practitioners in all
groups reported having received tech-enabled IPV cases in
their roles, conﬁrming the need for customer support to assist
survivors. Although no company had a protocol to respond
to IPV cases speciﬁcally, each company had a specialized
team for handling complex cases transferred from frontline
agents, such as malware-related issues that demand more time
and expertise. S9,4 a customer support specialist, mentioned
sharing a license key of their product’s premium version with
customers experiencing IPV. Agents also ask each other for
advice when encountering unfamiliar cases:
“Even though we don’t have formal training or content
around such issues . . . out of experience, we do share
some information on how we can handle such customers
. . . Higher tier agents actually talk to [frontline agents]
and guide them appropriately.” (S1, training consultant)
Train agents on tech-enabled IPV. Three groups acknowl-
edged the importance of training agents for cases of tech-
enabled IPV, recognizing that these cases were happening and
that agents did not have an established protocol to follow. A
director noted that even if a specialized team exists, frontline
agents still need to receive training that covers the complexity
of IPV and the role of technology in facilitating abuse:
“We [can have] a specialized team which . . . knows ex-
actly about next steps. But the ﬁrst contact is regular
support agents, who have no dedicated training on this,
and therefore there must be at least the awareness that
these kind of privacy issues, stalkerware . . . could be on
the device.” (S10, director)
Another director liked the idea of embedding trauma-
informed responses in training, noting that such responses
would beneﬁt all customers, not just IPV survivors:
“We do a lot of this already in terms of what we call the
empathy phrases or scripting. I think this is something that
could be done regardless of whether or not I’m interacting
with someone that is dealing with trauma or IPV. This
should be used across the board.” (S6, director)
Practitioners contributed ideas on training. S1, who created
training content for their company’s support agents, suggested
basing materials on stories or scenarios so that agents could
quickly draw connections to cases they encounter and identify
potential solutions. S10, a director, emphasized that training
should be offered regularly to keep up with the evolving spy-
ware landscape.
Address agents’ secondary trauma. Two groups reﬂected
on the necessity of providing mental health support to agents

ate them from IPV professionals.

who interact with IPV survivors and witness the tech-enabled
abuse they are experiencing. The notion that support agents
themselves might be survivors provoked reﬂection:
“Didn’t even consider that. It’s funny that considering the
stats . . . I got a hundred [agents] on the ﬂoor, odds are
some of them have been affected by this.” (S6, director)
S8, who maintained their company’s blog on digital rights
and anti-stalkerware initiatives, noted the psychological toll
in dealing with IPV cases especially for newcomers:
“These stories add up. I think they take a toll on us, par-
ticularly for people who aren’t aware of them. For people
who [ﬁrst] learned about how prevalent this problem re-
ally is, it can be a bit of a shaky, shattering moment for
them.” (S8, content writer)
Share tech safety resources. In line with IPV professionals’
suggestions, practitioners from all groups reported that their
company was already providing customers with general tech
safety advice under certain circumstances. Examples of such
advice included performing a factory reset when getting a
new phone and using a password manager if the customer
reports account hijacking.
Practitioners further expressed interest in providing cu-
rated content to educate customers about security and privacy.
Given that all companies already had a website with basic on-
line safety advice, practitioners viewed adding articles about
IPV and tech-enabled abuse as a low-hanging fruit of critical
importance. A director stressed that tech safety alone might
be insufﬁcient for survivors and should come with external
resources, similar to the IPV professionals’ suggestions:
“This could be quite easily done . . . setting up this knowl-
edge base article, help center . . . and giving the guidance
of ‘These could be potential steps to take in consideration
of safety planning. Get in contact with . . . organizations
that can support you.’ ” (S10, director)
Make referrals. Practitioners considered referrals to exter-
nal organizations achievable. Three groups said they already
did this to some extent, e.g., by directing victims of online
scams to a governmental fraud investigation team. A director
described a case of referring a customer to law enforcement:
“We’ve gotten requests in the past where people have
said, ‘Hey, I think my husband is hacking my computer.
Can you ﬁnd their IP address and do all this stuff for us?’
I’m like, ‘Well, we can’t do that for you. If you suspect
that something’s going on, ﬁrst let’s make sure that the
[product] is installed and running properly to protect
any type of intrusions . . . If you still have concerns, then
contact the local police and report.’ ” (S6, director)
Practitioners commented that expanding the scope of their
current list of external referrals would improve the process
without negatively impacting agents’ capacity. However, prac-
titioners also noted that referred resources should be up-to-
date and relevant, which requires maintenance efforts. More-
over, sharing geographically applicable resources could be
challenging for companies that operate on a global scale.
Regarding the idea of creating an internal specialized team
to handle tech-enabled IPV cases, three groups mentioned
budget and capacity barriers, particularly in the face of ﬁnan-
cial constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two groups
further suggested tracking the number of relevant cases to
inform this decision, echoing IPV professionals’ suggestions.
As a director told us:
“I think our founder would have a genuine interest but I
think we’d also need to balance that with business needs
. . . We need to get a better sense of how many calls we
have coming in that . . . go more towards violence and
partners taking retaliatory behavior.” (S3, director)
5.3
Implementation Challenges
Practitioners discussed challenges in implementing some
of IPV professionals’ suggestions. Some practitioners ques-
tioned whether customer support, as experts on products and
technical issues, should intervene in IPV cases. Others wor-
ried that frontline agents have limited capacity to help and
might struggle to identify survivors who need help.
Uncertain role of customer support. Two groups ex-
pressed uncertainty about the role of customer support in
addressing tech-enabled IPV. From their perspectives, agents
should play the traditional role of customer support — focus
on the product and make customers happy. They were hesitant
to let agents “take sides” in IPV situations. A director said:
“The agent’s role is to focus on the product. Because
we don’t know what’s going on in the customer’s life
. . . There’s the rights of the person that’s calling us as
well as the rights of the individual being accused. It’s best
not to take sides and just stay neutral.” (S6, director)
Other practitioners expressed conﬁdence in their products,
viewing them as the ultimate solution for most customers in-
cluding survivors. A training consultant considered increasing
customers’ conﬁdence in the product as the end-goal:
“[Customers] need to get conﬁdence in [the agent] they
talk to, that here, this person knows what technology is
. . . whatever workaround that person is providing, if they
follow that, then they don’t have to worry any further
about . . . being [the] victim of technological abuse.” (S1,
training consultant)

While a commitment to providing customers with high-
quality technical solutions is essential, the conﬁdence in se-
curity software’s ability to fully protect survivors contradicts
the caution requested by IPV professionals, who viewed
overpromising as frustrating and dangerous for survivors.
Nonetheless, not all practitioners shared this overconﬁdence.
A researcher agreed that agents should not overpromise and
drew connections to a case in which the attacker was conﬁg-
uring the victim’s Google accounts for location tracking:
“In this case, technically our detection could not help,
because this was actually done through the ofﬁcial Google
apps . . . We are aware of what stuff can go on, and we are
careful not to overpromise . . . pushing [our] product or
anything.” (S11, researcher)
S10, who came from the same company as S11, similarly
acknowledged their product’s limitations and the importance
of safety planning in removing stalkerware from the survivor’s
device. They further illustrated how agents could explain the
situation to a survivor:
“We cannot support you in the full steps but we know or-
ganizations you can [get] in contact with . . . If you discuss
the safety planning [with] them . . . then you can come
back and discuss with us how we [can] remove the app
from your device.” (S10, director)
Identifying potential survivors is challenging.
IPV pro-
fessionals argued that customer support should not be conser-
vative in making referrals. By contrast, support practitioners
tended to focus more on accurately identifying survivors who
might need referrals and saw challenges to this end. In re-
sponse to IPV professionals’ suggestion to familiarize agents
with common types of tech abuse, a director said this would
not be effective without self-disclosure from the survivor:
“That’s a good idea but in practice would be difﬁcult . . . I
think it’s really going to be the customers coming forward
and saying that this is happening. That would trigger stuff
on our end to handle it differently.” (S6, director)
Another director noted that most customers do not have
extensive technical knowledge and struggle to describe issues
accurately, making it challenging to diagnose the problem:
