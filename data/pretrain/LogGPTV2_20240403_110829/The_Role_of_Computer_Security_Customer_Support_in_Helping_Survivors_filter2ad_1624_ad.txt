### Demographics and Job Roles of Participants

Of the participants, all but two were identified as men. The majority had been in the industry for 5+ years. Half of the participants held director or manager positions, while the rest had diverse roles. Although "researcher" and "content writer" may seem unrelated to customer support, both participants provided valuable insights into tech-enabled abuse cases during initial email exchanges and in the focus groups.

### Study Protocol

We conducted the focus groups remotely via video chat due to the geographical dispersion of the participants. We structured our discussion using a five-part presentation based on the results from Section 4 (see Appendix B).

### Focus Group Discussion

#### Part 1: Background and Organizational Structure
In Part 1, we explored the participants' backgrounds, their company's customer support organizational structures, and metrics for measuring success. We also inquired if they had encountered tech-enabled intimate partner violence (IPV) cases in their roles (either personally or through a team member) and any company initiatives to support IPV survivors.

#### Parts 2-4: Summaries of IPV Professionals' Suggestions
In Parts 2-4, we presented summaries of IPV professionals' suggestions:
- **Part 2:** How to interact with survivors (Section 4.2)
- **Part 3:** Responsibilities of support agents (Section 4.3)
- **Part 4:** How to refer survivors (Section 4.4)

#### Part 5: Feedback on Training Components
In Part 5, we solicited feedback on the training components suggested by IPV professionals, such as common types of tech-enabled abuse, trauma-informed responses, and secondary trauma. Each part included specific examples and quotes from our focus groups with IPV professionals. Participants were encouraged to share their reactions and thoughts on the value, cost, feasibility, and challenges of implementing these suggestions. We used probes to elicit different opinions and fostered engagement among participants.

### Qualitative Data Analysis

We used inductive coding [65] to analyze the focus group transcripts. Our coding process was similar to that in Section 4.1: two researchers independently coded two transcripts, compared differences, created a consistent codebook, applied the codebook to the remaining transcripts, and reviewed all coded transcripts together. Our final codebook (see Appendix C.2) includes 49 codes covering topics such as existing practices, reactions to IPV professionals' suggestions, implementation challenges, and new ideas for supporting IPV survivors.

### Well-Received Suggestions

#### Importance of Assisting IPV Survivors
Practitioners agreed on the importance of assisting IPV survivors and training frontline agents for this purpose. They also endorsed the idea of providing and sharing tech safety resources, which they had been doing to some extent.

##### Existing Practices
All groups reported having received tech-enabled IPV cases, confirming the need for customer support to assist survivors. While no company had a specific protocol for IPV cases, each had a specialized team for handling complex cases, such as malware-related issues. For example, S9, a customer support specialist, mentioned sharing a license key for the premium version of their product with customers experiencing IPV. Agents also seek advice from higher-tier colleagues when encountering unfamiliar cases:

> “Even though we don’t have formal training or content around such issues . . . out of experience, we do share some information on how we can handle such customers . . . Higher tier agents actually talk to [frontline agents] and guide them appropriately.” (S1, training consultant)

##### Training for Tech-Enabled IPV
Three groups acknowledged the importance of training agents for tech-enabled IPV cases. A director noted that even with a specialized team, frontline agents still need training to recognize and respond to these cases:

> “We [can have] a specialized team which . . . knows exactly about next steps. But the first contact is regular support agents, who have no dedicated training on this, and therefore there must be at least the awareness that these kind of privacy issues, stalkerware . . . could be on the device.” (S10, director)

Another director supported embedding trauma-informed responses in training, noting that such responses benefit all customers, not just IPV survivors:

> “We do a lot of this already in terms of what we call the empathy phrases or scripting. I think this is something that could be done regardless of whether or not I’m interacting with someone that is dealing with trauma or IPV. This should be used across the board.” (S6, director)

S1, who creates training content, suggested using stories or scenarios to help agents quickly identify potential solutions. S10 emphasized the need for regular training to keep up with the evolving spyware landscape.

##### Addressing Secondary Trauma
Two groups highlighted the necessity of providing mental health support to agents who interact with IPV survivors and witness tech-enabled abuse. S6, a director, reflected on the likelihood that some agents might be survivors themselves:

> “Didn’t even consider that. It’s funny that considering the stats . . . I got a hundred [agents] on the floor, odds are some of them have been affected by this.” (S6, director)

S8, a content writer, noted the psychological toll on agents, especially newcomers:

> “These stories add up. I think they take a toll on us, particularly for people who aren’t aware of them. For people who [first] learned about how prevalent this problem really is, it can be a bit of a shaky, shattering moment for them.” (S8, content writer)

##### Sharing Tech Safety Resources
Practitioners from all groups reported providing general tech safety advice under certain circumstances, such as performing a factory reset or using a password manager. They expressed interest in adding articles about IPV and tech-enabled abuse to their websites, viewing it as a low-hanging fruit of critical importance. A director stressed the need to provide external resources alongside tech safety advice:

> “This could be quite easily done . . . setting up this knowledge base article, help center . . . and giving the guidance of ‘These could be potential steps to take in consideration of safety planning. Get in contact with . . . organizations that can support you.’” (S10, director)

##### Making Referrals
Practitioners considered referrals to external organizations achievable. Three groups already referred victims of online scams to governmental fraud investigation teams. A director described a case of referring a customer to law enforcement:

> “We’ve gotten requests in the past where people have said, ‘Hey, I think my husband is hacking my computer. Can you find their IP address and do all this stuff for us?’ I’m like, ‘Well, we can’t do that for you. If you suspect that something’s going on, first let’s make sure that the [product] is installed and running properly to protect any type of intrusions . . . If you still have concerns, then contact the local police and report.’” (S6, director)

Practitioners noted that expanding the scope of their current list of external referrals would improve the process without negatively impacting agents' capacity. However, maintaining up-to-date and relevant resources, especially for global companies, is challenging.

Regarding the idea of creating an internal specialized team to handle tech-enabled IPV cases, three groups mentioned budget and capacity barriers, particularly in the face of financial constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two groups suggested tracking the number of relevant cases to inform this decision, echoing IPV professionals' suggestions.

> “I think our founder would have a genuine interest but I think we’d also need to balance that with business needs . . . We need to get a better sense of how many calls we have coming in that . . . go more towards violence and partners taking retaliatory behavior.” (S3, director)

### Implementation Challenges

#### Uncertain Role of Customer Support
Two groups expressed uncertainty about the role of customer support in addressing tech-enabled IPV. From their perspective, agents should focus on the product and avoid taking sides in IPV situations. A director stated:

> “The agent’s role is to focus on the product. Because we don’t know what’s going on in the customer’s life . . . There’s the rights of the person that’s calling us as well as the rights of the individual being accused. It’s best not to take sides and just stay neutral.” (S6, director)

Other practitioners expressed confidence in their products, viewing them as the ultimate solution for most customers, including survivors. A training consultant considered increasing customers' confidence in the product as the end-goal:

> “[Customers] need to get confidence in [the agent] they talk to, that here, this person knows what technology is . . . whatever workaround that person is providing, if they follow that, then they don’t have to worry any further about . . . being [the] victim of technological abuse.” (S1, training consultant)

While a commitment to providing high-quality technical solutions is essential, overpromising the security software's ability to fully protect survivors contradicts the caution requested by IPV professionals, who view overpromising as frustrating and dangerous. Not all practitioners shared this overconfidence. A researcher agreed that agents should not overpromise and drew connections to a case involving location tracking through official Google apps:

> “In this case, technically our detection could not help, because this was actually done through the official Google apps . . . We are aware of what stuff can go on, and we are careful not to overpromise . . . pushing [our] product or anything.” (S11, researcher)

S10, from the same company as S11, acknowledged their product's limitations and the importance of safety planning in removing stalkerware from the survivor’s device:

> “We cannot support you in the full steps but we know organizations you can [get] in contact with . . . If you discuss the safety planning [with] them . . . then you can come back and discuss with us how we [can] remove the app from your device.” (S10, director)

#### Identifying Potential Survivors
IPV professionals argued that customer support should not be conservative in making referrals. By contrast, support practitioners focused on accurately identifying survivors who might need referrals and saw challenges in this. In response to IPV professionals' suggestion to familiarize agents with common types of tech abuse, a director noted that self-disclosure from the survivor is often necessary:

> “That’s a good idea but in practice would be difficult . . . I think it’s really going to be the customers coming forward and saying that this is happening. That would trigger stuff on our end to handle it differently.” (S6, director)

Another director noted that most customers lack extensive technical knowledge and struggle to describe issues accurately, making it challenging to diagnose the problem.
