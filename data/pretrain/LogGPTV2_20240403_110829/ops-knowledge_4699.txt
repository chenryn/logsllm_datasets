User: Analyze the following AWS Lambda function performance reports and make optimization suggestions. The average execution time of the AWS Lambda function is 6 seconds, the longest execution time is 30 seconds, and the peak value of concurrent requests for the function is 100. Among them, 60% of the request execution time exceeds 5 seconds, and 30% of the request execution time exceeds 10 seconds.
Assistant: Based on the above performance report, we can make the following optimization suggestions: 1. Reduce function execution time: For Lambda functions with an average execution time of 6 seconds and a maximum execution time of 30 seconds, you can consider optimizing execution efficiency from the code level, such as reducing useless calculation or control process, etc. We recommend using some performance optimization tools or manually refactoring the code to find bottlenecks, improve execution efficiency, and reduce function execution time. 2. Improve concurrent processing capabilities: The peak value of 100 concurrent requests is relatively high, indicating that the Lambda function needs to have high concurrent processing capabilities. It is recommended to use services such as Lambda's asynchronous call or Kinesis to expand the concurrent processing capabilities of functions to meet the requirements of high-concurrency scenarios. 3. Cache data processing results: If the data processed by the Lambda function is the same, you can consider caching the data processing results to avoid repeated calculations. Especially for some time-consuming operations or repetitive calculations, it is easy to cause the problem of long function execution time. Enabling the caching mechanism can significantly improve the speed of function execution. 4. Adjust resources: If the execution time of the Lambda function is too long, consider increasing memory or CPU resources so that the Lambda function can complete the task faster. Lambda provides gradually self-increasing memory settings. The higher the memory setting, the more CPU resources will be adjusted accordingly, and the running speed and performance will be improved accordingly. 5. Optimize asynchronous calls: If the Lambda function uses asynchronous calls, it is recommended to batch the asynchronous call requests. By packaging multiple requests into a larger request, you can reduce the latency of Lambda functions using asynchronous calls, and improve the throughput and response speed of the system.
