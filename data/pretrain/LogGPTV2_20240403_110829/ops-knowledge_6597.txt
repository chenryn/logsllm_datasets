User: I use Sublime Text and am using the terminal to run my code.
I would prefer to use the Python Shell to run my code, as it has color and is not so hard to look at.
Is there any easy way to do this other than saving then opening in IDLE?
Assistant: Stick with Sublime text. It's a popular text editor with syntax highlighting for several different programming languages. Here's what you need to do:

Press Ctrl + Shift + P to bring up command palette and enter "python".
Choose the option that says something like "Set syntax to Python".
Enter Python code then Ctrl + Shift + B to build the project.
Code will run below in another view(you will probably be able to move it to the side).

This is the standard procedure for a python setup in sublime text, but you may need to install
SublimeREPL for python in order to get user input. Just give it a Google search.
