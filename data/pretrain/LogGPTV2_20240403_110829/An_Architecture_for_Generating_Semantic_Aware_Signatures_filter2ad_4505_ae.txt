### Evaluation of Honeycomb and Nemean for Signature Generation

To further understand the benefits of semantics awareness in automated signature generators, we compared Honeycomb and Nemean on identical traces. This evaluation was complicated by two issues:

1. **Transformation of Honeycomb**: We converted Honeycomb’s Honeyd plug-in into a standalone application by feeding it input traffic from a pcap loop.
2. **Scalability Issues with Honeycomb**: Honeycomb, developed as a proof-of-concept tool, struggled to process large traces. Its processing time grows quadratically with each connection due to pairwise comparisons across all connections. For instance, running Honeycomb on a relatively small trace of 3000 packets took several hours on a high-performance workstation.

As a result, our evaluation focused on a qualitative comparison of Honeycomb signatures and its performance on a small trace with 126 HTTP connections.

#### Honeycomb's Performance
- **Signature Output**: Honeycomb produced 202 signatures from the input trace.
- **Quality of Signatures**: While some signatures were functional, many benign strings, such as "GET" or "HTTP," were identified by the LCS algorithm. These are clearly impractical and often the longest common substring between unrelated sessions.
- **Redundant and Restrictive Signatures**: Honeycomb generated many redundant and restrictive signatures, which could lead to multiple alarms for the same attack and false negatives.

#### Comparison with Nemean
- **Signature Specificity**: Nemean generalizes from clusters that include several connections, resulting in a smaller, balanced set of signatures.
- **False Negatives and False Positives**: Nemean's balanced signatures are less susceptible to false negatives. Additionally, Nemean's semantics awareness reduces the inclusion of benign substrings, thereby minimizing false positives.
- **Examples of Weaknesses**: Table 7 provides examples of signatures generated by Honeycomb, highlighting their lack of specificity and redundancy.

### Discussion

**Nemean's Vulnerabilities and Deployment Considerations**
- **Data Source**: Nemean uses honeynets as a data source, which could be vulnerable to evasion or pollution by attackers. Evasion can be mitigated by periodic rotation of the monitored address space.
- **Live Network Deployment**: 
  - **Separation of Trafﬁc**: Live networks have mixed trafﬁc, so anomaly detection techniques are necessary to separate normal from malicious traffic.
  - **Signature Format**: Nemean must generate meaningful signatures for NIDS like Snort and Bro. Converting Nemean signatures to Bro is straightforward, while Snort requires an HTTP preprocessor.
  - **Automation and Resilience**: The limited manual selection required suggests that automating Nemean's deployment is feasible. Nemean's resilience to false positives makes it attractive for defending against rapid worm propagation.

### Conclusions

We have described the design and implementation of Nemean, a system for generating balanced NIDS signatures. Nemean's architecture includes a data-abstraction component and a signature-generation component, supporting independent enhancements. Using packet traces collected at honeynets, Nemean demonstrated the ability to create accurate signatures with extremely low false alarm rates for various attack types, including buffer overflows, attacks with large diversity, and complex protocols like NetBIOS/SMB.

### Future Work
- **Online Capabilities**: Enhance Nemean's online capabilities and evaluate its performance over longer periods in live deployments.
- **Clustering and Learning**: Continue to refine clustering and learning methods to fine-tune the resulting signature sets.
