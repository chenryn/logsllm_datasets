**Describe the problem**

Now I have downgraded to 1.11.0 but then still my tensorflow-gpu is not
working.
nvidia-smi is working fine.

tf.test.is_gpu_available(  
cuda_only=False,

I ran this, its coming false
then ,  
I ran this sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))  
Device mapping: no known devices.

it's coming empty, I read lot of threads usually people had error with cuda,
by installing that it worked for lot of people.
But then in my case things were working fine earlier, now it got messed up and
cuda is installed properly.
why should I do?
