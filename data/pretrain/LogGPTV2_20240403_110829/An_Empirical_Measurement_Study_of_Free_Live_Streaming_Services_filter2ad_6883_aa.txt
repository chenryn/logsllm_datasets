Abstract. Live streaming is one of the most popular Internet activi-
ties. Nowadays, there has been an increase in free live streaming (FLS)
services that provide unauthorized broadcasting of live events, attract-
ing millions of viewers. These opportunistic providers often have modest
network infrastructures, and monetize their services through advertising
and data analytics, which raises concerns about the performance, qual-
ity of experience, and user privacy when using these services. In this
paper, we measure and analyze the behaviour of 20 FLS sports sites on
Android smartphones, focusing on packet-level, video player, and pri-
vacy aspects. In addition, we compare FLS services with two legitimate
online sports networks. Our measurement results show that FLS sites
suﬀer from scalability issues during highly-popular events, deliver lower
QoE than legitimate providers, and often use obscure and/or suspicious
tracking services. Caution is thus advised when using FLS services.

1 Introduction
In 1995, a company called Progressive Networks1 broadcast the ﬁrst live sports
streaming event on the Internet, featuring a baseball game between the Seat-
tle Mariners and the New York Yankees [26]. Since then, the growing adoption
of smartphones and the emerging mobile Internet (i.e., 4G, 5G, and LTE tech-
nologies) have enabled users to watch live events from anywhere without much
diﬃculty. Mobile video streaming, including live streaming, currently accounts
for 75% of total mobile data traﬃc [6]. This high demand for video streaming is
both an opportunity and a challenge for network service providers.
For users, the Quality of Experience (QoE) for video streaming is impor-
tant [10]. Measuring QoE can be done either with a subjective approach in
which human viewers rate video sessions on a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) scale,
or an objective approach that collects information from diﬀerent protocol layers
and uses mathematical models to estimate QoE for the video content [27]. Since

measuring QoE is challenging, there are several studies that map network-level
Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to user QoE [23]. This paper focuses on
network-level and video QoS parameters that impact QoE.
The growth in popularity for live sports streaming has led to the emergence
of many free live streaming (FLS) sites. However, using these unauthorized and
unregulated providers raises concerns about QoS, QoE, and user privacy. For
instance, these FLS sites may not have adequate network infrastructure to deliver
scalable services, and as a consequence, both QoS and QoE may suﬀer. Further-
more, many of these FLS sites recoup their operational costs through advertising
and data analytics, which raises concerns about what user-level information is
collected by these sites, and where such information is sent.
Prior research eﬀorts have focused on blocking live broadcasting sites [21,29],
or detecting security leaks in FLS sites [25]. However, many Internet users still
seek out these free sites despite their awareness of security concerns, and the
number of FLS sites and users continues to proliferate [1].
In this paper, our basic premise is that users should be aware of the many
tradeoﬀs associated with video streaming sites, including performance (i.e., QoS
and QoE) as well as security and privacy. We study live sports streaming from
both free and legitimate sites, doing so from these diﬀerent viewpoints. The
purpose of our study is to provide better insight into how video providers deliver
their services, and what QoS is provided. Based on these insights, users can make
better-informed decisions about using these services or not.
The research questions in our work are the following:
– What are the performance characteristics of FLS providers?
– What is the network and video QoS provided by FLS services?
– Are these services scalable for popular events?
– What privacy risks are associated with these services?
To study live sports streaming, we collected network traﬃc measurement
datasets from several FLS sports sites during NHL, NBA, NFL, and UEFA
(soccer) games in the 2019–2020 season. To capture video streaming sessions, we
customized an existing mobile video streaming measurement tool [18] to study
these services from diﬀerent viewpoints. Also, we compared the FLS results with
streaming from two popular monthly-paid service providers (TSN and DAZN).
This comparison is motivated in part by the well-known adage: “If you are not
paying for the service, then YOU are the product being sold”.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
– We conduct a network traﬃc measurement study of FLS sports sites during
selected NHL, NBA, NFL, and UEFA games in the 2019–2020 season.
– We measure and analyze the delivered network and video QoS for FLS services
on a smartphone.
– We compare the live video streaming from FLS Web sites with two well-known
monthly paid online sports networks.
– We investigate privacy concerns when using FLS services on smartphones.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides back-
ground on FLS. Section 3 describes our experimental methodology, measurement
environment, and data collection process. Section 4 presents our measurement
results. Section 5 summarizes prior related work. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 Free Live Streaming
FLS services provide an infrastructure that allows Internet users to watch live
events for free. Users can access live streams (usually without the owner’s permis-
sion) even without registration [13]. In these services, the channels are neither
catalogued nor listed in directories, and are not searchable via the Web site.
Instead, the channel owner usually shares the channel links in online social net-
work communities in order to reach viewers. One example is Reddit, a popular
online social network on which users discuss, share, and rate Web content.
There are ﬁve major players in the FLS ecosystem: Media Providers that pro-
vide and stream the media content; Channel Providers that receive live streams
from media providers and serve them to users; Aggregators that provide a list
of available streams for users to browse; Advertisers that support the foregoing
three entities through ads and overlays; and Users that watch their favourite
live stream events found via the aggregators [1].
Sports streaming services are popular and constantly evolving [25,30]. In this
paper, we study Web-based sports FLS services from a vantage point in Canada.
3 Measurement Methodology
Analyzing live video streaming on smartphone devices faces many challenges [8].
Video streaming characteristics such as QoE have to be observed to see how
the user might react. Also, a multimedia stream may be encoded using diﬀerent
video codecs, devices may receive diﬀerent resolutions and bitrates, depending
on their screen size, location, end-to-end network status, membership type, etc.
Processing and analyzing the captured traﬃc is another challenge, because of
the voluminous network traﬃc involved. Furthermore, encryption makes mea-
surement and analysis more diﬃcult.
We used MoVIE [18], an open-source mobile video streaming analyzer, to cap-
ture and analyze live video sessions on an Android smartphone. MoVIE provides
a multi-level view of video streaming by intercepting and analyzing all incom-
ing/outgoing network traﬃc of a smartphone. MoVIE analyzes video streaming
at the packet-level, ﬂow-level, and video player level. We extended the existing
MoVIE tool by adding a Privacy View component to its Traﬃc Interceptor com-
ponent. We leveraged EasyList2 from the ad-blocker community to investigate
the generated ﬂows to ﬁnd potential ads, trackers, and malicious connections.
Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of MoVIE, which consists of seven com-
ponents: Traﬃc Interceptor, Packet Tracer, Player View, Privacy View, Mapper,
Main, and Graphical User Interface. For more details about MoVIE, see [18].

3.1 Experimental Setup
We set up a controlled measurement environment similar to Fig. 1 to capture
the transmitted packets, ﬂows, and video player activities during live streaming
events. Table 1 shows our system speciﬁcations. The mobile device and the PC
were set up to use the same WiFi access point. We ran MoVIE on a Linux PC
running MITMproxy [7] to intercept the network traﬃc, and Wireshark to cap-
ture traces of the Internet traﬃc generated by the smartphone. MoVIE captured
all video player activities using an Android application that exploits the Google
Chrome media feature.

All video streaming sessions were streamed using the Google Chrome browser.
We performed a factory reset to ensure that other software or previous exper-
iments do not impact our experiments. In addition, we updated the OS and
pre-installed apps to the latest versions. We cleared the browser history and
cache before each streaming session. During each session, the Chrome browser
played video streams on the smartphone, while Wireshark and MoVIE were run-
ning on the PC to capture network traﬃc at the packet level. For each FLS Web
site, we captured a video streaming session of 1–5 min in duration.
Since MITMproxy v4.0 is not able to decrypt HTTPS traﬃc from an updated
Android device, we designed our setup to decrypt Android traﬃc on a single
smartphone under test. To do this, we rooted the Android mobile device by
using the Magisk tool. Rooting allows a user to have root access to the Android
operating system with privileged access to modify code or install software that
the vendor would not normally allow. Then we installed Xposed version 90-beta3
to install the Charles proxy certiﬁcate in system mode. Finally, we installed a CA

Certiﬁcate on the mobile device. Charles proxy3 version 4.2.8 was installed on the
PC to capture and decrypt all SSL connections generated from the smartphone.
We used this setup to provide more data for privacy analysis.
Once the measurement environment was set up, we started the data collection
tools on the PC and the video streaming on the mobile device. After capturing
all network traﬃc, we used MoVIE to analyze the data.
3.2 Data Collection
To collect our dataset, we focused on FLS Web sites that are shared in sports-
themed sections on Reddit. We monitored these forums during the NHL, NBA,
NFL, and UEFA Champions League 2019–2020 season to ﬁnd popular FLS
providers.
Reddit has subreddits, which are like a Web forum in which users discuss and
share content. Reddit diﬀers from other social networks like Twitter, Instagram,
or Facebook in that subreddits are openly accessible. The shared content is not
limited to registered users, members, or friends. Users can access shared content
and links without logging in. Ayers et al. [1] analyzed the data gathered from
Alexa and SimilarWeb4 and observed that the Reddit community receives up to
86 million visits a month from users looking for sports streams.
We observed that free sports streams are usually aggregated and shared in a
few popular subreddits. In these subreddits, users can like or dislike shared FLS
Web sites. Web sites with more likes increase in popularity and rise to the top of
the Web page, and have a higher chance to attract even more visitors. Although
there are approaches to automatically crawl and discover aggregator Web sites
using online search engines [1], we found that most FLS pages are not reachable
via search engines. Furthermore, service providers delete pages after the events.
For these reasons, we manually selected the top-5 most popular FLS Web sites
based on user votes for each of NHL, NBA, NFL, and UEFA events.
To compare the performance of FLS services with legitimate providers, we
considered several features from the packet-level to the application-level. Since
streaming sports events are geo-restricted and speciﬁc sports events are available
only through speciﬁc online sports channels within each region, we subscribed to
two Canadian online sports channels. The main sports provider in Canada is TSN
(The Sports Network), which holds the Canadian rights to the top sports events.
We also study DAZN, a relatively new sports streaming service in Canada.
Our collected dataset is composed of the top-5 popular (according to the likes
from users) FLS Web sites in four popular sports, as gathered from the Red-
dit community, along with the two subscription-based sports streaming services.
All videos are captured with the experimental setup mentioned in the previ-
ous subsection. We analyzed the captured data of an NBA game in December
2019, the NFL SuperBowl in February 2020, a UEFA playoﬀ game in Febru-
ary 2020, and an NHL game in March 2020. All captured events are before the

global shutdown of sports events due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. All
captured network data, video streaming log, and player activities are available
online [17]. We used the traceroute command to determine the geographic
locations of streaming sessions. In general, UEFA events were streaming from
European countries, while the NBA, NHL, and NFL events were streaming from
North America. However, some of the FLS sites use CDNs, and we could not
ﬁnd their originating locations.
4 Measurement Results
To gain a comprehensive view of FLS, we evaluated video streaming from four
diﬀerent viewpoints, namely Network QoS, Video QoS, QUIC, and privacy.
4.1 Network Quality of Service (QoS) Analysis
Since most FLS providers record live events from a legitimate streaming service
and broadcast them simultaneously [1], the quality of these services is unknown.
In order to evaluate the network QoS provided by FLS Web sites, we analyze
the packet-level traﬃc transferred during the streaming sessions.
Throughput. Several studies have proposed intelligent throughput-aware
bitrate selection and adaptation algorithms for video players to improve the QoE
in adaptive streaming techniques [32]. These algorithms predict the throughput
and determine the bitrate for the next chunk of the video. High throughput vari-
ation could result in quality switches or stalls during the video playback [15].
Figure 2(a) shows boxplots of the average throughput for the FLS and legitimate
providers. The legitimate sites had throughputs of 4–9 Mbps, compared to 1–6
Mbps for the FLS sites. The FLS throughputs were higher for the NFL and NHL
sites, and lower for the UEFA and NBA sites. The FLS sites had problems during
popular games, such as the 2019 NBA Finals, in which a Canadian team won
the championship for the ﬁrst time in NBA history. During this event, the FLS
Web sites were not always able to deliver video, and some rejected new users
with the message “Viewer limit reached”. Table 2 in the Appendix provides fur-
ther details for each service provider, and time-series graphs of throughput are
available on our project Web site [17].

Delay. Network packet delay is an important performance characteristic of a
computer network [3,28]. We used ping to estimate the average delay of service
providers. We set the ping packet size based on the average packet size of a
video streaming session. We conducted the ping test during the games when the
server was broadcasting and users were streaming. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the
average network delay for FLS sites tends to be much higher than the legitimate
sites, and vary much more widely, though it does depend on their geographic
location (e.g., some NHL streaming sites are in Calgary). Table 2 in the Appendix
presents more detailed results for each service provider.
Packet Loss. We used the ping ﬂood technique to study the packet loss. We
observed that packet loss for the legitimate Web sites is about 0%, while it is
between 1% and 4% for FLS providers. The higher loss can indicate problems
in the network. Zennaro et al. [33] observed that packet loss below 1% is good,
1%–2.5% is acceptable, 2.5%–5% is poor, 5%–12% is very poor, and packet loss
in excess of 12% is bad. Their observations showed that above 5% of packet
loss, video conferencing becomes irritating and incomprehensible. The number
of packet losses for each streaming site is shown in Table 2 in the Appendix.
4.2 Video Quality of Service (QoS) Analysis
In this section, we analyze the video QoS for our sports streaming Web sites.
Startup Time. Startup time is the elapsed time between when the user requests
a video stream and the start of playback. This metric includes network delays
(e.g., RTT, DNS, CDN) and the initial buﬀering delay [9]. Previous studies have
shown that startup time is important, though it has only a small impact on
QoE [20,34]. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the legitimate Web sites start playing a
video about 1 to 2 s faster than the FLS sites. We observed 8 to 16 s of startup
delay when streaming from NBA FLS providers.

Broadcast Delay. Broadcast delay is an intentional delay (often 7 s) inserted

events. To calculate the real-time broadcast delay, we used information from
two auxiliary Web sites to determine the actual time elapsed in a sports game:
FlashScore.com and Bet365.com. FlashScore.com provides the fastest live and
detailed stats of thousands of competitions in more than 30 sports, and Bet365
is one of the world’s leading online gambling companies worldwide that covers
over 30 diﬀerent sports. As shown in Fig. 3(b), DAZN had a broadcast delay of
around 12 s for UEFA competitions. The FLS services that deliver UEFA games
had between 1 and 4 min of broadcasting delay. This delay could be due to the
time for recording and broadcasting the video. Due to the nature of live sports
events, immediacy is extremely valuable. In general, live events streamed from
FLS Web sites are not always truly “live” streams.
Some of the FLS Web sites, and in particular NHL aggregators, have a broad-
casting delay around 30–35 s. By reviewing video player activities, we observed
that these FLS services use channel providers like Wstream or Vimeo to deliver
live streaming while recording videos. We also used the traceroute tool to locate
the source of streaming, but found that these channel providers use CDNs like
Akamai to deliver videos to users. Pandey et al. [24] also noted the use of Akamai
CDNs by 4 of 12 illegal sports and news streaming providers studied. The most
likely reason for using CDNs is to reduce latency for users.
Visual Quality. This metric indicates the average video resolution received
by the video player, particularly when the streaming rate and quality level are
dynamically adapted to the available bandwidth, such as in DASH (Dynamic
Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) [31]. In our experiment, the two legitimate
Web sites and several FLS Web sites (except NBA providers) provide HD video
quality. However, we observed that the transferred data for the same duration of
the same video streaming on a legitimate Web site is higher than the FLS Web
sites.
Quality Switches. The number of quality changes is another video QoS factor
that aﬀects QoE [23]. The number of quality switches is calculated by counting
the number of video resolution changes over the duration of the video session. We
observed that 11 out of 20 FLS sites experienced two or more quality switches.
We also found that a few FLS providers did not switch to lower resolution when
