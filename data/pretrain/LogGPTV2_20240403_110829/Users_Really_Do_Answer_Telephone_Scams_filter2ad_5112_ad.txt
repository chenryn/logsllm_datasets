a female synthesized voice can result in a more successful
attack than using a male synthesized voice in the context
of the IRS scam example. The two groups have a Cohen’s
d of 0.192, which suggests the effect size is small and not
educationally signiﬁcant. Therefore, it is difﬁcult for us to
conclude at this time if the voice gender has a signiﬁcant
effect on the attack success of a telephone phishing scam.
Can manipulating the voice accent have a signiﬁcant ef-
fect on the attack success of a telephone scam?
To provide an answer to this question, we compare the num-
ber of possibly tricked between similar experiments that used
different accents, i.e., E6 and E7. In our question concerning
the signiﬁcance of voice accent, we test if speaking with an
American accent is signiﬁcantly more effective than speaking
with an Indian accent in the context of the IRS scam example.

1Using p-values corrected with Holm-Bonferroni’s step-down method [30].
2Using effect size descriptors by Cohen [31] & Wolf [32]
Using the same right-tailed p-value approach, we have a
χ2 statistic of 1.015 and an adjusted p-value of 0.314. Using
an arbitrary conﬁdence level of 95%, we cannot conclude
that speaking with an American accent can result in a more
successful attack than speaking with an Indian accent in the
context of the IRS scam example. The two groups also have
a Cohen’s d of 0.082, which suggests the effect size is very
small and not educationally signiﬁcant. Therefore, we are
not able to conclude at this time if the voice accent has a
signiﬁcant effect on the attack success of a telephone phishing
scam.
Can spooﬁng a known caller name have a signiﬁcant ef-
fect on the attack success of a telephone scam?
To provide an answer to this question, we compare the num-
ber of possibly tricked between similar experiments that show
a difference in the display of a caller name, i.e., E8 and E9.
In our question concerning the signiﬁcance of spooﬁng caller
name, we test if displaying a HR-department caller name “W-
2 Administration” is more effective than not displaying a
caller name in the context of the HR scam example.
Using the same right-tailed p-value approach, we have a
χ2 statistic of 2.106 and an adjusted p-value of 0.147. Using
an arbitrary conﬁdence level of 95%, we cannot conclude that
displaying a HR-department caller name can result in a more
successful attack than displaying a caller name in the context
of the HR scam example. The two groups also have a Cohen’s
d of 0.119, which suggests the effect size is very small and
not educationally signiﬁcant. Therefore, we are not able to
conclude at this time if spooﬁng a known caller name has a
signiﬁcant effect on the attack success of a telephone phishing
scam.
Can manipulating the entity scenario have a signiﬁcant
effect on the attack success of a telephone scam?
Any form of spear phishing involves impersonating an inter-
nal entity that the recipient is familiar with. The scammer has
to create a spoofed caller ID and devise a scenario that is tai-
lored to the entity, as the “Entity” cannot be set independently
from “Scenario”. To provide an answer to the hypothesis
question, we compare the number of possibly tricked between
similar experiments that used different entity-scenarios, i.e.
comparing E1 and E5 with E8 and E10. In our question con-
cerning the signiﬁcance of impersonating an internal entity,
we test if impersonating an internal entity is more effective
than impersonating the IRS with the context of the scenarios
tested.
Using the same right-tailed p-value approach, we have a χ2
statistic of 31.976 and an adjusted p-value of 1.56E-8. Using
an arbitrary conﬁdence level of 95%, it is likely that imperson-
ating an internal entity can result in a more successful attack
than impersonating the IRS with the context of the scenarios
tested. The two groups also have a Cohen’s d of 0.331, which
suggests the effect size is small and educationally signiﬁcant.
Therefore, we could say that impersonating an internal entity
had a signiﬁcant effect on the attack success of a telephone
phishing scam.
Can manipulating the type of motivation have a signiﬁ-
cant effect on the attack success of a telephone scam?
To motivate the recipient into taking some harmful action,
the scammer could either use fear or reward. To provide an
answer to the hypothesis question, we compare the number
of possibly tricked between similar experiments that used
different types of motivation, i.e., comparing E1 and E8 with
E5 and E10. In our question concerning the signiﬁcance of
the type of motivation, we test if fear-based scenarios are
more effective than reward-based scenarios the context of the
entities tested.
Using the same right-tailed p-value approach, we have a
χ2 statistic of 0.395 and an adjusted p-value of 0.530. Using
an arbitrary conﬁdence level of 95%, we cannot conclude that
fear-based scenarios can result in a more successful attack
than reward-based scenarios with the context of the entities
tested. The two groups also have a Cohen’s d of 0.036, which
suggests the effect size is very small and not educationally
signiﬁcant. Therefore, we are not able to conclude at this time
if manipulating the type of motivation has a signiﬁcant effect
on the attack success of a telephone phishing scam.

Summary
Figure 6: Summary of statistical hypothesis testing results.
The summary of our statistical hypothesis testing results is
shown in Figure 6. Based on the statistical hypothesis results,
we found that impersonating an internal entity had the most
signiﬁcant effect on the attack success of a telephone phishing
scam. We also found that manipulating the area code (using a
toll-free vs. a 202 area code) can have a somewhat signiﬁcant
effect.
On the contrary, manipulating the type of motivation, voice
production, voice accent, and caller name, individually had
an insigniﬁcant effect on the attack success. It is also difﬁcult
for us to conclude whether manipulating the voice gender
has a signiﬁcant effect even though the result was statistically
signiﬁcant.
5 Survey Responses
In this section, we highlight the recorded survey responses
that asked the participants for the reasons they were convinced
or unconvinced to enter the last four digits of their Social Se-
curity number. We listened to all 44 recorded voice responses
and tabulated their responses in Table 6.
Based on the voice responses from the survey respondents,
no one provided an explicit voice response on why they were
convinced by the IRS scams. The four recordings we received
were either silent or contained no useful information. We
believe that participants were less willing to report the rea-
sons why they were convinced by the scam after they were
explicitly told that they had fallen victim to an attack.
On why the IRS scams were unconvincing, most of the
survey respondents stated that they already knew that the IRS
would not make a call like this or that they were already vig-
ilant about IRS scam calls. This is understandable because
there are numerous media reports about the IRS scams, and
the IRS posted many public warnings not to trust these types
of scams. This further supports the hypothesis that the im-
personated identity and the corresponding scenario was the
most signiﬁcant factor. In experiment E7, two respondents
also mentioned that the Indian accent was one of the reasons
they were unconvinced.
On why the ASU imposer scams convinced them, most
of the survey respondents described something related to the
scam scenario, which means that the impersonated entity and
the scenario were the key factors. Three respondents also
believe that the caller ID was from ASU and stated caller ID
was one of the reasons they believed in the scam, even though
none of the caller IDs were actually from ASU.
On why the ASU scams did not convince them, most of
the survey respondents stated that they were quite certain that
ASU would not make a call like this or they were already
vigilant about giving their SSN information over an incoming
call. Two respondents in experiment E9 mentioned that the
scenario only asked for the last four digits of their SSN, and
should have asked for their complete SSN if it was really
payroll related, which quite possibly meant that those two
might have given out their complete SSNs if the phishing
scam had asked for it. The external caller ID and synthetic
voice were also mentioned as factors that made the survey
respondents suspicious.
6 Limitations
The experiments were conducted in a university setting where
the recipients are university staff and faculty. The demograph-
ics of the recipients in our study are not representative of the
general population of telephone users in the US.
The experiments only sent out calls to a speciﬁc brand of
work phones. The type of phone in our study is not represen-
tative of the entire population of telephones in the US. The
vast majority of telephones in the US are mobile phones [33],
and it is possible that these have different actual tricked rates
than work phones. In addition, the participants had to be in
their ofﬁce when receiving the phone call (or to return our call
if they listened to the voicemail), which is a different usage
behavior compared to mobile phones.
The experiments requested only partial SSN information
without storing it. The experiments had several safeguards,
and the process was carefully designed and tightly regulated
to ensure risks and harm to the human research subjects were
minimized. This prevented us from collecting any actual So-
cial Security numbers from the recipients. Collecting actual
Social Security numbers might have changed the results of
the study: more people might be willing to give out their full
Social Security numbers, or more people could be skeptical
of providing their full Social Security number.
As we did not collect the Social Security numbers directly,
we derived a metric called “possibly tricked.” While the goal
is to provide an estimate of the number of Social Security
numbers that a real scammer would collect, this metric may

sonated calls, such as, caller ID authentication [4, 34, 35],
which has strong safeguards against caller ID impersonation
and could help to warn the users against malicious calls with
a reputation system.
7 Discussion
8 Related Work
Our results show that automated telephone phishing attacks
can be effective. One experiment, E9, which simulated a tar-
geted phishing attack with caller name spooﬁng, achieved a
10.33% possibly tricked rate, where recipients possibly di-
vulged the last four digits of their Social Security numbers.
We have also validated some potential key attributes that
can have a signiﬁcant effect on the scam effectiveness: imper-
sonating an internal entity and announcing a relevant scenario.
Manipulating the caller ID to a toll-free area code may also
somewhat improve the scam effectiveness for certain scams.
Other attribute properties such as human voice, female voice,
American accent, caller name spooﬁng, and fear-based sce-
nario also improved the scam effectiveness in our empirical
study, however, at this time we are not able to conclusively
demonstrate that they have a signiﬁcant effect. Nonetheless,
given how easy it is for a scammer to manipulate all these
attributes, a scammer would seek to incorporate all attribute
properties that made an improvement to the attack success,
i.e. a phishing scam with toll-free area code, spooﬁng known
