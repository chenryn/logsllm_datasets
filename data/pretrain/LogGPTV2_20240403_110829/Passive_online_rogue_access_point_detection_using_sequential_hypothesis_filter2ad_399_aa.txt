### Abstract
Unauthorized (rogue) wireless access points pose significant security threats to local networks. This paper introduces two online algorithms for detecting rogue access points using sequential hypothesis tests on packet-header data collected passively at a monitoring point. One algorithm requires training sets, while the other does not. Both algorithms build upon our earlier TCP ACK-pair technique to differentiate between wired and wireless LAN traffic, leveraging the fundamental properties of the 802.11 CSMA/CA MAC protocol and the half-duplex nature of wireless channels. Our algorithms make prompt decisions as TCP ACK-pairs are observed, with minimal computation and storage overhead. We have implemented a system for online rogue-access-point detection and deployed it at a university gateway router. Extensive experiments in various scenarios demonstrate the excellent performance of our approach: the algorithm requiring training provides rapid and highly accurate detection (mostly within 10 seconds, with very low false positive and false negative rates), while the algorithm without training detects 60%-76% of wireless hosts without any false positives. Both algorithms are lightweight, with computational and storage overheads well within the capabilities of commodity equipment.

## 1. Introduction
The deployment of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks (WLANs) has grown significantly over the past several years. While these networks offer convenience and productivity, they also introduce network management and security challenges. One of the most critical issues is the presence of rogue access points (APs), which are installed without explicit authorization from network administrators. Although often set up by well-intentioned users, rogue APs can expose the network to unauthorized access, leading to potential data theft, resource misuse, and even attacks. Additionally, rogue APs can interfere with authorized APs, degrading network performance.

Given these security and performance risks, detecting rogue APs is a crucial task for network managers. Two main approaches exist for rogue AP detection:
1. **RF Monitoring**: This involves monitoring the radio frequency (RF) airwaves, possibly using additional information from routers and switches. However, this approach can be costly, difficult to scale, and less effective against APs that spoof signatures.
2. **Traffic Monitoring**: This approach monitors incoming traffic at a traffic aggregation point (e.g., a gateway router) and determines whether a host uses a wired or wireless connection. If a host is detected using a wireless connection without authorization, the attached AP is flagged as rogue. This method is scalable, cost-effective, and easy to manage, but it requires effective techniques to distinguish between wired and wireless traffic.

In this paper, we focus on the second approach and develop two online algorithms for detecting rogue APs. Our key contributions include:
- Extending the analysis in [25] to show that TCP ACK-pairs can effectively differentiate between Ethernet and wireless connections (including both 802.11b and 802.11g).
- Developing two online algorithms using sequential hypothesis tests. One algorithm requires training data, while the other does not. These are the first passive online techniques for rogue AP detection by differentiating connection types.
- Implementing and deploying a system for online rogue-AP detection at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms, with the trained algorithm providing rapid and highly accurate detection, and the untrained algorithm detecting 60%-76% of wireless hosts without false positives. Both algorithms are lightweight and suitable for commodity equipment.

### 1.1 Related Work
**RF Monitoring Approaches**: Many commercial products and research efforts use RF monitoring to detect rogue APs. For example, AirMagnet [2] and NetStumbler [8] manually scan RF waves, while others use sensors for automated scanning [1, 9, 4]. While these methods provide continuous monitoring, they can be expensive and less effective against APs that spoof signatures. Recent research [10, 11, 27] also uses RF sensing, but these approaches may still suffer from high deployment costs and false positives.

**IP Traffic Monitoring Approaches**: Studies like [13, 19] detect rogue APs by monitoring IP traffic. [13] shows that wired and wireless connections can be visually separated in packet traces, but this method is not practical for real-time, automated detection. [19] requires packet segmentation, making it an active rather than passive approach. Other studies [12, 26, 15] use entropies, active measurements, or assumptions about wireless links, which do not apply to our scenario.

**Sequential Hypothesis Testing**: This statistical method allows for real-time decision-making as data becomes available, making it suitable for our purpose. It has been used for prompt portscan detection [18].

## 2. Problem Setting and Approach
Consider a local network, such as a university campus or an enterprise network, where a monitoring point is placed at an aggregation point (e.g., a gateway router) to capture incoming and outgoing traffic. End hosts within the network use either wired Ethernet or 802.11 WLAN to access the Internet. Unauthorized hosts may install rogue APs to connect to the network. Our goal is to detect these rogue APs in real time using passive measurements at the monitoring point.

To achieve this, we need to address two questions:
1. **What statistics can be used to effectively detect wireless hosts?**
2. **How can we detect wireless hosts in an online manner?**

We have shown in [25] that inter-ACK times, the inter-arrival times of TCP ACK-pairs, can effectively differentiate between wired and wireless hosts. In this paper, we extend this analysis to 802.11g and derive new results for Ethernet and 802.11b. For online detection, we develop two lightweight algorithms using sequential hypothesis tests, which calculate the likelihoods of a host using WLAN or Ethernet as TCP ACK-pairs are observed. When the WLAN likelihood exceeds a certain threshold compared to the Ethernet likelihood, the host is classified as using WLAN.

## 3. Analysis of TCP ACK-Pairs
In this section, we extend the analysis in [25] to demonstrate analytically that inter-ACK times can effectively differentiate between Ethernet and WLAN (including both 802.11b and 802.11g).

### 3.1 Assumptions and Settings
Our analysis settings are illustrated in Figure 2. An outside sender transmits data to a receiver in the local network. In the Ethernet setting (Figure 2(a)), the receiver uses Ethernet, while in the WLAN setting (Figure 2(b)), the receiver uses 802.11b or 802.11g. The router, located between the sender and the receiver, is connected to the sender via link L2 with a 100 Mbps bandwidth. The monitoring point is placed between the sender and the router, tapping into link L2. In the Ethernet setting, the router and receiver are connected by link L1 with 100 Mbps bandwidth. In the WLAN setting, an access point is placed between the router and the receiver, with link L1 having 100 Mbps bandwidth and the receiver connected to the access point using 11 Mbps 802.11b or 54 Mbps 802.11g. In both settings, the router's queues are assumed to be empty.
