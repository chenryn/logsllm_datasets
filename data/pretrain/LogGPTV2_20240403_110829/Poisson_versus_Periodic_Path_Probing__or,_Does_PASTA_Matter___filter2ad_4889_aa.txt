Abstract— The well-known PASTA (“Poisson Ar-
rivals See Time Averages”) property states that, under
very general conditions, the fraction of Poisson arrivals
that observe an underlying process in a particular state is
equal, asymptotically, to the fraction of time the process
spends in that state. When applied to network inference,
PASTA implies that a Poisson probing stream provides
an unbiased estimate of the desired time average. Our
objective is to examine the practical signiﬁcance of the
PASTA property in the context of realistic RTT, loss rate
and packet pair dispersion measurements with a ﬁnite
(but not small) number of samples.
In particular, we
ﬁrst evaluate the differences between the point estimates
(median RTT, loss rate, and median dispersion) that re-
sult from Poisson and Periodic probing. Our evaluation
is based on a rich set of measurements between 23 Plan-
etLab hosts. The experimental results show that in al-
most all measurement sessions the differences between
the Poisson and Periodic point estimates are insigniﬁ-
cant. In the case of RTT and dispersion measurements,
we also used a non-parametric goodness-of-ﬁt test, based
on the Kullback-Leibler distance, to evaluate the similar-
ity of the distributions that result from Poisson and Pe-
riodic probing. The results show that in more than 90%
of the measurements there is no statistically signiﬁcant
difference between the two distributions.

In the context of active measurements, a sequence of
probing packets is injected in a network path with the ob-
jective to measure end-to-end properties such as Round-
Trip Time (RTT), loss rate, or available bandwidth (re-
lated to the time-spacing, or dispersion, between succes-
sive packets). A central issue in active measurements
is the characteristics of the probing process [1]. From
a mathematical perspective, it is often claimed that “the
right way” to do probing (or sampling) is to use a Poisson
process (meaning that the interarrivals between probing
packets should be independent and exponentially distrib-

uted with the same mean) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
Poisson probing derives its strength from the well-
cited PASTA property, which stands for “Poisson Arrivals
See Time Averages” [7]. Consider a stochastic system
and suppose that we want to infer the fraction of time
pX the system spends in a state X. Let us assume that
this time average exists. A stream of N “probes” arrives
in the system based on a Poisson process, recording the
system’s state at the arrival time instant. PASTA states
that the expected value E[fX,N ] of the fraction of Pois-
son probes that observe the system at state X is equal to
the time average pX. This powerful result does not make
any assumptions about the stochastic system, except that
the time average pX exists; stationarity or ergodicity may
be needed in order to prove that however.
The underlying reason for the validity of PASTA is
that the monitored system cannot “anticipate” the next
probing event, due to the memoryless nature of the Pois-
son measurement process. Notice that the the Poisson
probes may be interacting with the monitored system.
In the case of a queueing system, for example, prob-
ing packets can be backlogged, serviced, or dropped, as
any other packet, and they may also affect the magni-
tude of the time average pX. It is also important to note
that PASTA is an asymptotic result: fX,N tends to pX
as the number of probes N tends to inﬁnity. The sam-
ple average fX,N , even though an unbiased estimate, can
signiﬁcantly deviate around pX depending on N and on
the variability and correlation structure of the underlying
system [8].
On the practical side, the most common measurement
approach is to use Periodic probing, rather than Poisson
probing. For instance, the popular ping utility generates
a periodic probing stream. An important advantage of
Periodic probing is that the duration of a measurement
session can be a priori known, given the number of sam-
ples and the probing period. Furthermore, scheduling
periodic packet transmissions at mainstream (not real-
time) operating systems is easier and more accurate than

scheduling random, and potentially very short or very
long, packet interarrivals.
It should be noted that the
use of Periodic probing does not mean that the result-
ing estimate will be necessarily biased, especially if the
probing rate is sufﬁciently high. It is true, however, that
only Poisson probing can provably result in an unbiased
estimate under general conditions.
An important question, which is still unresolved to the
best of our knowledge, is whether PASTA “matters” in
the pragmatic context of RTT, loss rate, and bandwidth
(or dispersion) measurements in the Internet. Given that
Periodic probing has some important practical beneﬁts,
we need to know whether Poisson and Periodic probing
sequences lead to signiﬁcantly different estimates. In this
paper, we focus on three signiﬁcant path performance
metrics: RTT, loss rate and dispersion of back-to-back
packet pairs. Our objective is to evaluate the differences
that result from Poisson and Periodic probing, both in
terms of point estimates for the ﬁrst moment of the un-
derlying distributions, as well as in terms of differences
in the distributions themselves. Note that, since this is
a measurement study over wide-area Internet paths, we
do not know whether Poisson and/or Periodic probing
measure the actual time average of the previous perfor-
mance metrics. Instead, we can only examine whether
the two probing techniques observe the same (but poten-
tially wrong!) path performance.
In Section 2, we describe our measurement collection
process. In Sections 3, 4, and 5 we analyze the RTT, loss
rate, and dispersion measurements, respectively. Our re-
sults show that in almost all measurement sessions the
differences between Poisson and Periodic point estimates
are insigniﬁcant. In the case of RTT and dispersion mea-
surements, there is no statistically signiﬁcant difference
between the Poisson and Periodic distributions in about
90% of the measurements. We conclude with some ad-
ditional remarks in Section 6.
2 Measurement methodology
We collected measurements of RTT, packet loss rate,
and packet pair dispersion in network paths between
23 PlanetLab hosts. Speciﬁcally, we used PlanetLab
nodes at the following sites: RNP (Brazil), UC San
Diego, UC Berkeley, U-Oregon, U-British Columbia, U-
Texas, UIUC, Georgia Tech, CMU, MIT, U-Maryland,
INRIA (France), Intel Research Cambridge (UK), UPC
(Spain), U-Reykjavik (Iceland), EPFL (Switzerland),
Helsinki Inst. of Tech. (Finland), U-Tsinghua (China),
Hong Kong Univ. of Science & Tech, National Tai-
wan Univ, Equinix (Singapore), U-Tokyo (Japan), and
U-Melbourne (Australia). The measurements reported
in this paper were collected from 53 source-destination
pairs. Each measurement session (or simply “session”)
consists of 600 Poisson probes and 600 Periodic probes
transmitted at the same average rate. The two probing
streams of a session start at the same time, and so they
cover approximately the same time window.
A session is characterized by a source-destination pair,
the average probing interarrival I, and the packet size L.
The probing interarrival was 10ms, 20ms, 50ms, 100ms,
500ms, or 1sec, meaning that a session lasts from 6 sec-
onds to 10 minutes, depending on I. For the RTT and
loss rate sessions L was 32, 64, 480, or 1400 bytes, while
for the dispersion measurements L was 480, 800, or 1400
bytes. The number of successfully completed sessions
was 1272 for each of the RTT and loss rate measurements
and 954 for the dispersion measurements.
It turned out that some paths were either too slow for
our probing streams (especially with I=10ms or 20ms
and large packet sizes), or they were extremely con-
gested. In a pre-processing step, we ﬁltered out all ses-
sions in which the loss rate was higher than 10% in the
RTT and dispersion analysis; those sessions were in-
cluded, however, in certain parts of the loss rate analy-
sis (as noted in § 4). The number of sessions we were
left with was 892 for RTT and loss rate and 749 for dis-
persion. The RTT and dispersion time measurements
were obtained with kernel-level (libpcap) timestamps,
reported in a resolution of one microsecond.
3 RTT measurements
Comparison of median RTTs: The sample median is a
robust point estimate for the ﬁrst moment of a distribu-
tion. Let Te and Tp be the median RTTs estimated from
the Poisson and Periodic probing streams, respectively,
in a particular session. We deﬁne the relative difference
between the two RTT medians as T = 2 Te−Tp
. Fig-
ure 1 shows the empirical CDF of T . About 60% of
the sessions do not see any difference (T ≈ 0), while
about 85% of the sessions have |T| <1%. The maxi-
mum relative difference is 4%. The results are actually
quite similar for the relative difference of RTT means.
Consequently, at least in relative error terms, Poisson and
Periodic probing result in practically the same RTT esti-
mate. The fact that the two probing processes measure
almost equal median RTTs, however, does not mean that
they also observe the same RTT distribution; we examine
this issue next.
Goodness-of-ﬁt test: To further explore the differ-
ences between Poisson and Periodic probing, we also ex-
amine the RTT distributions measured by the two prob-
ing processes. Let Se and Sp be the Poisson and Periodic
RTT samples, respectively, collected in a particular ses-
sion. We form the following null hypothesis:
Te+Tp
H0 : Se and Sp follow identical distributions.
(1)
The alternate hypothesis is that there is a statistically
signiﬁcant difference between the two distributions. A

poses the two distributions are identical. The KS test,
however, rejects H0 with a low P-value (P =0.08). The
reason the test fails is the discontinuity at about 87.5ms.
The maximum vertical distance between the two CDFs
is 7.4%, it occurs at the 25-th percentile of the Poisson
distribution, while the horizontal offset with the Periodic
distribution at that point is only 31 microseconds! It is
noted that we observed similar failures with other non-
parametric statistical tests, such as the Kruskal-Wallis
analysis-of-variance test.
To deal with the previous discontinuity problems, we
constructed a more robust non-parametric goodness-of-
ﬁt test based on the Kullback-Liebler (KL) distance, also
known as relative entropy [9]. For two discrete proba-
bility mass functions (pmf’s) q1 and q2, deﬁned over the
same set of values Q, the KL distance of q1 relative to q2
is
q1(i)
q2(i)
(2)
D(q1 k q2) =X
q1(i) log2
i∈Q
Figure 1: The relative difference T between Poisson and
Periodic RTT medians.
It can be shown that D(q1 k q2) ≥ 0 and that D(q1 k
q2) = 0 if and only if the two distributions are identical.
Notice that D(q1 k q2) 6= D(q2 k q1).
The KL test proceeds in three steps:
1. Estimate the pmf’s se and sp (deﬁned on the same
set of bins) from the samples Se and Sp, respec-
tively. The details of the binning procedure are de-
scribed in the Appendix.
2. Calculate the KL distance D(se k sp) of the Pois-
son relative to the Periodic sample.
the KL distance
3. Estimate the distribution of
D(se,i k ¯se,i) between randomly chosen partitions
Se,i and ¯Se,i of the Poisson sample Se (“bootstrap-
ping”). Speciﬁcally, suppose that we randomly par-
tition Se in two samples Se,i and ¯Se,i. Let se,i and
¯se,i be the corresponding pmf’s, and so D(se,i k
¯se,i) is the KL distance of this partition. If we re-
peat this random partitioning process many times,
we can estimate the distribution of D(se,i k ¯se,i).
4. Reject the null hypothesis if D(se k sp) is “too
large” relative to the distribution D(se,i k ¯se,i).
Speciﬁcally, estimate the P-value as
P ≈ Prob[D(se k sp) ≤ D(se,i k ¯se,i)]
(3)
and reject H0 if P < 0.1.
Figure 3 shows an example of the distribution of D(se,i k
¯se,i) together with the KL distance D(se k sp) for a par-
ticular session. The KL test is more robust than the KS
test in the presence of CDF discontinuities. The reason
is that instead of relying on a single point of maximum
vertical difference, the KL test considers the difference
between the two distributions across all bins, weighted
by the probability mass at each bin. For the example of
Figure 2: A session in which the KS test performs poorly.
non-parametric goodness-of-ﬁt test can reject H0 with a
low P-value when the two given samples have a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant difference, even if the underlying distri-
butions are strongly non-Gaussian. Recall that P-value is
the lowest signiﬁcance level α at which we can reject the
null hypothesis. The P-value is between 0 and 1. H0 is
often rejected when the P-value is less than 0.05-0.10.
Our initial approach was to use the well-known
