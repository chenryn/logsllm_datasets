where p denotes the probability that the node is available,
i.e., node availability.
By applying the above expression, write availability
Pwrite for the TP [9] can be expressed as
Pwrite = Ψ(b,(cid:6)b/2(cid:7) + 1) × h(cid:5)
Ψ(sl, w).

The write availability for the probabilistic TP is exactly
the same as above.
4.1 Read Availability
The probability that the top level will be readable is
equal to the probability that more than half the b nodes
will be available in the probabilistic TP. If (sl−w+1−tl)
nodes are available for the l-th level, then it is readable.
That is, the probability that the l-th level will be readable
is
Ql =
Ψ(b,(cid:6)b/2(cid:7) + 1),
Ψ(sl, sl − w + 1 − tl).

In the probabilistic TP, if one or more levels are readable,
read operations are successful. Therefore, read availabil-

4.2 Average Number of Nodes Accessed
We analyzed the average number of nodes accessed to
evaluate system load with the probabilistic TP. The num-
ber was derived as the average number of nodes accessed
for read/write operations. The number of accessed nodes
depends on procedures that check whether the l-th level
is readable. In this section, we discuss our analysis of the
procedure described in Section 3
If the l-th level is readable, the average number of
nodes accessed with the procedure is derived as
U(cid:1)(b, (cid:1)b/2(cid:2) + 1,(cid:1)b/2(cid:2) + 1, 0)
Ψ(b, (cid:1)b/2(cid:2) + 1)

Ψ(sl, sl − w + 1 − tl)
,
(l = 0)
(l (cid:3)= 0)
,
(17)
where the denominator for Eq. (17) is the probability that
(sl − w + 1 − tl) of sl nodes will be available. The nu-
merator is recursively derived as
U(cid:1)(n, j, k, c)
p · U(cid:1)(n − 1, j − 1, k − 1, c + 1)
+(1 − p) · U(cid:1)(n − 1, j, k, c + 1).

However, if the l-th level is not readable, the average
number of nodes accessed during the procedure can be
derived as
V (cid:1)(b, (cid:1)b/2(cid:2) + 1, (cid:1)b/2(cid:2) + 1, 0)
1 − Ψ(b, (cid:1)b/2(cid:2) + 1)

(l (cid:3)= 0)

(19)
where the denominator for Eq. (19) is the probability that
(w+tl) of sl nodes will not be available. As well as using
Eq. (17), the numerator can be recursively derived by
V (cid:1)(n, j, k, c)
p · V (cid:1)(n − 1, j − 1, k − 1, c + 1)
+(1 − p) · V (cid:1)(n − 1, j, k, c + 1).

The write operation checks each level at the one time.
Therefore, the average number of accessed nodes for
write operations, Cwrite, is the summation of the average
number of accessed nodes for the l-th level of all levels.

4.3 Numerical Evaluations
Figure 4 plots the read availability for the probabilistic
TP, as a function of node availability p. Figure 4(a) plots
the results for sl = 8l + 4, h = 1, N = 16, f = 0.5, and
w = 1. Figure 4(b) plots the results for sl = 2l+3, h = 2,
N = 15, f = 0.5, and w = 1. For example, consider Fig.
4(a), where the read availability for γ = 0.3, p = 0.99 is
about (1 − 10−9). Similarly, the read availability for γ =
0.15 is about (1 − 10−6). The read availability for the TP
with γ = 0.0 is about 0.9999 and LV read availability for
γ = 0.15 is 0.99. The read availabilities increase as node
availability increases. For larger γ, the read availability
improves quickly, but the LV read availabilities improve
much slower.
Figure 5 plots the read availability for the probabilis-
tic TP, as a function of the number of nodes N. Figure
5(a) plots the results for sl = 8l + 4, p = 0.9, f = 0.3,
and w = 1. Figure 5(b) plots the results for sl = 8l + 4,
p = 0.99, f = 0.3, and w = 1. For example, consider
Fig. 5(a), where the read availability for γ = 0.3 and
N = 100 is (1 − 10−11). Similarly, the read availabil-
ity for γ = 0.15 is about (1 − 10−4). The increased N
