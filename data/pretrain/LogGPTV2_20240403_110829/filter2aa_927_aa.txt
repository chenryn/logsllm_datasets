Taiwan's Importance in the 
Semiconductor Landscape
►With decades of development, Taiwan has established itself as a leading player in the 
semiconductor industry. Some of the well-known leaders include TSMC and  MTK
•
“Taiwan is set to become the largest and fastest-growing semiconductor equipment maker in the
world by increasing by 21.1 percent to reach US$12.31 billion.” -Taiwan News, July 2019
Cyberattack to semiconductor vendors
❖
Just like the TSMC ransomware, a cyberattack against semiconductor could
potentially
❖ Seriously impact Taiwan’s economy
❖ Affect the entire global supply chain
❖
In this report, we will show how IT attacks on semiconductor vendors can be just as
dangerous as an OT attack.
❖ Attack to OT - production line halt, immediately damage 
❖ Attack to IT - leak important intelligence property, long-term damage
Large-scale APT attacks on 
Semiconductor Industry
Between 2018 and 2019, we discovered several attacks on semiconductor vendors
Vendors located at the Hsinchu Science Park(HSP) were targeted
After our white paper was published, the received feedback revealed that more than 7 
vendors were targeted by the same threat actor
Extensive attack: > 7 semiconductor vendors were attacked
The APT attacks on the important vendors were precise and well-coordinated. Aside from 
the vendors themselves, their subsidiaries, and competitors were all targeted
Not a single point attack, but an attack on the entire industry 
surface

Group Chimera
►As the activities, attack techniques,
and tactics were similar, we believe
this was the work of the same threat
actor
►Target: Semiconductor Vendors
►Malware:
Merged different Open

(Dumpert
and
Mimikatz , CobaltStrike)
►C2:

(Google App Engine, Azure)
►Goal: Steal Documents, Source code,

Investigation Overview
Investigation Period: 
2018~2019
Investigated Vendors: 
3+ 
Total Endpoints Analyzed: 
30k
Today's Case Study
➢
The three vendors involved in the analysis currently have a leading global
position in their own market segments
➢
Due to the different investigation time points, the analytical perspective of
the attack campaign was different
A Company
• Our long-term partner. The long-
term monitoring allowed more 
details of the attacker's activities 
to be revealed.
• The detailed information enabled 
us to track the root cause.
B Company
• One-time IR service. When the 
investigation started, it was 
already a long time after the 
attacks happened.   
• Highlighted the threat actor’s 
long-term activities and what data 
was leaked.  
C Company
• Long-term partner with high 
security capacity. 
• Help us to deep investigate, get a 
lot feedback from them
• Give us more information to 
illustrate threat actors

not original names
A Company
Case A: Overview
➢
Activity date: 2019/12/09 ~ 2019/12/10
➢
15 endpoints and 6 user accounts were
compromised
➢ Note that all the names are de-identified  
➢
Four malwares and eight C2 servers were
found
Cobalt Strike
➢
Disguised Cobalt Strike beacon as Google Update.exe
➢ VT search found nothing
➢ Injected payloads into other processes
➢
Found in two endpoints: Server-LAUREN & PC-SHENNA
Used Hosting Server for C2 
➢
Network security devices had difficulty detecting the associated C2 servers, as they
were in the Google Cloud Platform.
•
Created backdoor which was disguised as Google Update.
•
Other cloud hosting services were also abused
Root Cause Analysis - PC-SHENNA
➢
With our Timeline Analysis, we found that the backdoor in PC-SHENNA was
implanted from Server-LAUREN
Server-
LAUREN
PC-
SHENNA
Attack was launched right before
employees began to get off work
Remote Execution Tools
schtasks
➢
The first Cobalt Strike backdoor was
located at NB-CLAIR, and was then
remotely copied to Server-LAUREN
➢
A valid account was used to invoke
Cobalt Strike via schtasks
WMIC
➢
Server-LAUREN
used
wmic
to
remotely execute various commands
in another endpoint to check if there
was an Internet connection
Applied benign program to achieve their malicious activities
Root Cause Analysis - Server-LAUREN
➢
Due to our new findings, additional information could be added to our
investigation graph
Server-
MELINA
Server-
SHANAE

LAUREN 
PC-SHENNA
Root Cause Analysis - Server-LAUREN 
➢
Server-LAUREN remotely used an archive tool to collect registry and ntds.dit in
Server-MELINA(DC) for offline breaking
NTDS.DIT Explanation
➢
Active Directory data was stored in the ntds.dit ESE database file. Two copies of
ntds.dit were present in separate locations on a given domain controller.
•
%SystemRoot%\NTDS\ntds.dit
•
%SystemRoot%\System32\ntds.dit
ntds.dit is the AD database, containing domain hosts and users information(e.g. ID, 
name, email and password). As ntds.dit was encrypted, and the key was stored I the 
SYSTEM registry, the adversary also needed to make a copy of the registry data.
Root Cause Analysis - NB-CLAIR
➢
Through correlation analysis, our AI investigation showed
that NB-CLAIR used Schedule Task to place malware to the
schedule tasks of Server-LAUREN

Root Cause Analysis - NB-CLAIR
➢
In the NB-CLAIR timeline, we discovered six minutes before the scheduled task
execution, IP1 used RDP and User-01 to make a successful login
•
This is highly likely to be the root cause of the attack
Nightshift? Overtime?
Recon
➢
Several "net user" commands were executed for
recon purposes, and the results were saved to the
RecordedTV_lib.log
Data Exfiltration
➢
RECORDEDTV.MS was used to archive the stolen data for data exfiltration
•
Identical binaries were found in several machines, but under different names, e.g. 
RECORDEDTV.MS, uncheck.dmp, and jucheck.exe
