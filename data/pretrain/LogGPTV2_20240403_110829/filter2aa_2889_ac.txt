Center for Space Studies (CNES), Dr. Serge expanded on his description of the
object, noting that the halo reminded him of the color produced by the com-
bustion of copper salts.  It is also noteworthy that Dr. Serge, who serves as di-
rector of a nuclear physics laboratory, did not report the sighting to anyone and
did not mention it to his colleagues. It was only when the observation by Miss
M. and her father was mentioned in newspapers that he volunteered his own
experience. It should be noted further that, in addition to the reports from the
gendarmes, the letters from the witnesses, and the investigations by GEPAN
scientists, several of the observers were interviewed in person by a judge, a
former president of the regional Court of Appeals. 
Case no. 5: June 19, 1978. Gujan-Mestras (France) Ð Classi®cation: MA-2
This incident took place near Arcachon in France on June 19, 1978, and was
also investigated in depth by GEPAN.9 While the Grenoble case was remark-
able for the convergence and high quality of the observations, the present case
introduces another exceptional parameter: the UFO triggered the photocells
that control the lights for the whole town.  From the distance and the threshold

level of the cell it is possible to derive an estimate of the power output of the
object.
The town where the sighting took place is Gujan-Mestras. There were inde-
pendent witnesses near C…on and La R…ole. A local newspaper described how
two frightened young men, an eighteen year-old cook named Franck Pavia and
a seventeen-year-old butcher’s apprentice named Jean-Marc Guitard, knocked
on the door of a baker, Mr. Varisse, who was preparing the next day’s bread, at
about 1:30 a.m.
The teenagers had stopped on the side of the road to repair the turn signal of
their car when all the lights of the town were suddenly switched off. At the
same time, a powerful rumble like an earthquake made them jump. Then they
saw the object.  It was, by their descriptions, oval, red, surrounded with white
ªflames,º and it flew toward them at an altitude they estimated as 11,000 feet.
At this point Jean-Marc became unable to breathe and fainted. The object
then changed direction and flew away.  While telling their story to the baker
(who reportedly laughed at them), both witnesses were reportedly terrified,
had trouble speaking, and Jean-Marc had red, teary eyes.
At approximately the same time of night a thirty-five-year-old restaurant
manager named Mr. Bach†re, who was driving toward Bordeaux, saw ªa large
orange ball, very brightº that hovered over La R…ole at about 1,000 feet before
disappearing.  It reappeared at the same spot one minute later.  Mr. Bach†re’s
wife confirmed his observation.
Given these reports, which were transmitted by law enforcement officials to
GEPAN in Toulouse, the task force decided to investigate immediately: three
of their scientists were at the site the next day. They interviewed the witnesses
at length, took them to the location, and had them point a theodolite to the
places where the object had appeared and disappeared in an effort to establish
triangulation. Finally, the witnesses were given a set of standard color samples
from which they made a selection corresponding to the phenomenon they had
seen.
This investigation brought to light the testimony of additional witnesses who
had previously remained silent. For instance, Mr. B., a student who lived in
Gujan, confirmed that he was outside when the town lights died at a time that
he estimated as half an hour past midnight; concurrently, he had heard a strong,
low rumble that scared him. Mr. B. saw orange flashes above the pine trees,
below the cloud ceiling.
The measurements made in the field established that all witnesses had ob-
served the same object, within the expected errors of human recall. There was
rough agreement on time, duration, distance, trajectory, sound, and luminosity
parameters. Understandably there were also discrepancies regarding the alti-
tude and apparent diameter of the object. One of the witnesses who gave the
more consistent measures was used as the primary source for these estimates.
The manager of the town utility department was also interviewed. He
showed the investigators the location of the photoelectric cells that control the

street lights. When these cells are exposed to a light that exceeds their thresh-
old (10 mW/m2), they assume that daylight has arrived and they turn off the
system.The results of the analysis bracket the distance between the cell and
the UFO:  between 135 meters and 480 meters, or roughly between 400 and
1,500 feet.Although the diameter of the disc was estimated (5 meters) this is ir-
relevant to the calculation of the power output, which can be determined from
the luminous flux at the photocell via equation (3). Assuming a distance of 135
m one obtains
P  0.01 ´ 4p(135)2
(10)
hence P  2.3 kW whereas for 480 m, P  29 kW, assuming isotropic radiation
from the object.
Curiously the GEPAN Report states that it assumes a continuous spectrum
(black body radiation) and cites a range for the minimum power output be-
tween 160 kW and 5 MW.  It is not a safe assumption that UFO emission is
anything like a black body:  The report states: ªThe fact that it was glowing red

sion at or above 700 nm.º
Case no. 6: August 24, 1990 Greifwahl (Germany) Ð  Classi®cation: MA-1
Numerous eyewitness reports, supported by videotapes and photographs,
make this ªone of the best-documented sightings in Europe,º according to  von
Ludwiger, to whose analysis the reader is referred for full details of the case
(Von Ludwiger, 1995). Independent witnesses observed formations of lumi-
nous spheres hovering in the sky Northeast of Greifswald. Hundreds of tourists
and local residents saw, photographed and filmed the phenomena, character-
ized by rapid accelerations and abrupt changes of direction, inconsistent with
known phenomena or manufactured objects. One private investigation group
received six videotapes and eleven photographs from different individuals and
interviewed in person more than a dozen witnesses.
The investigation concluded that the phenomena consisted of two groups of
luminous spheres that hovered nearly motionless for about 30 minutes be-
tween 8:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. over the Pomeranian sea. The brighter and clos-
er group formed a circle of six luminous spheres. The second group formed the
shape of a Y.º
The German weather service reported that approximately 5/8 of the sky was
covered with high, fleecy clouds in partly shaded masses and gray, sheet-like
clouds at 2,500 meters. There was a light ENE wind and the temperature was
about 60 degrees F, or 16 degrees C.
Given the number of precise observations, supported by photographs, it was
possible to triangulate the position of the objects with some accuracy. From a
distance of 14 km the Y formation appeared to be as bright as the full moon,
according to one of the photographers, Mr. Ladwig. If the spectral distribution
is equal to that of the moon, then the square distance law for the power output
of the moon with 0.138 lux yields an estimated optical power output of: 
P = 1.8 ´ 10-3 ´ 4p ´ 14,0002 = 4.4 ´ 106 W  by following the same reasoning as
in the Fort-de-France situation (case no. 2).  
Discussion
The figures derived from the six cases we have reviewed are summarized in
Table 1. They range from low values (equivalent to the power of a small
motor) to the energy range of a nuclear reactor. The estimates do not cluster
around a particular value, and form no pattern. There may be several reasons
for this. We may be in the position of a person trying to estimate the power of a
truck by the intensity of its headlights: the actual energy figure may be orders
of magnitude beyond our calculations. Alternately, light emission may be only
a side effect of a hypothetical propulsion mechanism, as carbon monoxide is a
side effect in the exhaust of an automobile engine.
The impact of the observations on human witnesses can be dramatic, sug-
gesting that other physiological and psychological parameters are present. The
main witness in case no. 3 (Dr. G.) was a physics professor who reported 
fear when confronted with the phenomenon. It forced him to shield his eyes
and frightened his children, who woke up crying. One witness in case no. 5, a
seventeen-year old male, developed breathing difficulties and fainted. Later
his eyes appeared red and teary.
In discussing these figures one must keep in mind that the literature contains
equally reliable cases when the objects were dark or had a dull surface with no
light emission whatsoever, although they performed the same evolutions as the
objects studied here.
Conclusion
Many investigators have been discouraged by the difficulty of deriving reli-
able parameters from chance observations made under uncalibrated field con-
ditions by surprised witnesses. The present study does show, however, that a
small percentage of reported UFO cases meet sufficient criteria of reliability to
yield quantitative data regarding distance and brightness. From these data we
have shown that it was possible to arrive at a rough estimate of power output.
In the present state of our ignorance about the physical nature of the report-
ed objects, and given the lack of attention given the subject by scientific and
technical personnel who might be in a position to improve the quality of the
data, we can only speculate on the mechanisms that give rise to these emis-
sions. A complete examination of the data reveals cases when witnesses were
temporarily blinded by the light from such objects, and other cases when phys-
iological sequelae were reported such as burns or skin injuries (Vallee, 1990).
Whether the reported phenomena turn out to be natural or artificial in nature,
their widely reported impact on human witnesses should encourage us to
