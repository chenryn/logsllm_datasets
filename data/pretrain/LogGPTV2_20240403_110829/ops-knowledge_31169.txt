User:  How to use Ansible to deploy common web services, such as Nginx, MySQL, PHP-FPM, etc.?
Assistant: Using Ansible to deploy common web services requires the following steps: 1. Install Ansible: Ansible tools need to be installed before deployment, which can be installed according to official documents. 2. Write Ansible playbook: According to the services that need to be deployed, write an Ansible playbook file for each service, which contains specific commands and operations that need to be executed. 3. Specify the target host: When writing an Ansible playbook, you need to specify the target host (which can be a single or multiple hosts), that is, which machines the service needs to be deployed on. 4. Execute Ansible playbook: Use the ansible-playbook command to execute the prepared playbook file, and Ansible will automatically operate it according to the specified target host to implement service deployment. For example, to deploy Nginx service, you can write the following playbook file: ``` - name: Install Nginx hosts: webserver become: true tasks: - name: Install Nginx apt: name: nginx state: latest update_cache: yes notify: - Restart Nginx handlers : - name: Restart Nginx service: name: nginx state: restarted ``` Among them, "name" represents the task name, "hosts" specifies the target host, "become" represents running with root privileges, and "tasks" represents specific tasks," handlers" indicates other operations that need to be notified when the Nginx service is installed. When executing the playbook file, Ansible will automatically install the Nginx service on the target host and restart the service. Deployment of other services can be done similarly.
