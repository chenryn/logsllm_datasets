Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode process of the distributed file system receiving blocks from various sources. It begins with a PacketResponder terminating, followed by the DataNode receiving blocks from various sources. The FSNamesystem then updates the blockMap with the source and size of the blocks. The log ends with the DataNode receiving another block.
