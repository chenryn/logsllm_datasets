### How to Use the Badge Component with Buttons, Tabs, and Typography

I am looking for guidance on how to effectively use the `Badge` component in conjunction with the following elements:
- **Buttons**
- **Tabs**
- **Typography**

I have thoroughly searched the repository's issues and have not found a solution that addresses this specific use case.

#### Expected Behavior
I expected to be able to use the `Badge` component as follows (example code):

```jsx
// Example with Button
<Badge badgeContent={4} color="primary">
  <Button variant="contained" color="primary">
    Notifications
  </Button>
</Badge>

// Example with Tab
<Badge badgeContent={2} color="secondary">
  <Tab label="Inbox" />
</Badge>

// Example with Typography
<Badge badgeContent={10} color="error">
  <Typography variant="h6">Messages</Typography>
</Badge>
```

However, these examples do not work as expected.

#### Current Behavior
The `Badge` component is currently only demonstrated with icons, as shown in the demo page:

```jsx
<Badge badgeContent={3} color="primary">
  <Icon>notifications</Icon>
</Badge>
```

#### Context
I need to use the `Badge` component to display counts or indicators on buttons, tabs, and text elements. This is a common UI pattern, and I believe it should be supported by the `Badge` component.

#### Environment
- **Material-UI Version**: 1.0.0-beta.31

If you have any suggestions or can provide a working example, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!
