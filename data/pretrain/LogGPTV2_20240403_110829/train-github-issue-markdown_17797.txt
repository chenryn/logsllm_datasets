I read in my dataframe with
     pd.read_csv('df.csv')
And then I run the code:
    df['a'] = pd.to_numeric(df['a'], errors='coerce')
but the column does not get converted. When I use errors = 'raise' it gives me
the numbers that are not convertible but it should be dropping them with
coerce.... This was working perfectly in Pandas 0.19 and i Updated to 0.20.3.
Did the way to_numeric works change between the two versions?
