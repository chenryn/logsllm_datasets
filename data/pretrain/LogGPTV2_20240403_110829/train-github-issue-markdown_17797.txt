I loaded my DataFrame using the following code:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('df.csv')
```

Then, I executed this line of code to convert the 'a' column to numeric values, with non-convertible entries being set to `NaN`:

```python
df['a'] = pd.to_numeric(df['a'], errors='coerce')
```

However, the conversion does not seem to be working as expected. When I use `errors='raise'`, it correctly identifies the non-numeric values that cannot be converted. But with `errors='coerce'`, these values should be replaced with `NaN`, and this is not happening.

This process worked perfectly in Pandas 0.19, but after updating to version 0.20.3, it no longer functions as expected. Has the behavior of `pd.to_numeric` changed between these two versions?
