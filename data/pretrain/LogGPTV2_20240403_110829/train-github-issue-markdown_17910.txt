If this is something that can't be added or isn't going to be supported, it
wouldn't be a bad thing to support hierarchical data in forms (adjacency list
model / nested set model).
Possibly having the option to force the selection of leafs without children
only, etc, etc. Can lead to a very powerful feature. =)
