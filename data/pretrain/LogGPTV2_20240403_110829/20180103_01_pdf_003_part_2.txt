### Equivalents in Existing Extensions and Architectural Aspects

To ensure that all developments and applied tools remain freely available, it is essential to consider various parameters, including user behavior, potential changes in usage, and the current status of building renovation or refurbishment. These aspects are summarized under a "soft factors" class.

The 3DCityDB scheme, derived from the CityGML model, is currently available in SQL languages such as PostgreSQL and Oracle. By integrating the 3DCityDB tool with PostGIS, it is possible to display 3D-rendered CityGML datasets. Since the CityGML structure was originally designed for urban planning, its capabilities need to be expanded for this project. In addition to geometrical and geographical data, building performance values and measured energy values must be processed.

### Application Domain Extensions (ADEs)

Prefabricated expansions, known as Application Domain Extensions (ADEs), are available to meet additional requirements for CityGML. For example, "CityGML EnergyADE" includes information about the thermal and energetic characteristics of buildings, while "CityGML UtilityNetworksADE" models underground supply grids. These extensions contain necessary relationships that meet the project's specifications regarding the thermal and energetic perspectives of campus properties. These relationships are captured in UML diagrams and implemented into the 3DCityDB relational database schema, as shown in Figure 2.

### Database Schema and Table Structure

Figure 3 describes a small area of the developed PostgreSQL database schema. The DB class "building energy" stores the necessary minimal datasets for the TEASER application in a single table. This approach simplifies the retrieval of information for simulation using standardized scripts such as Python. With automated interaction between the database and simulation tools, building models can be created quickly, allowing for more variations to be calculated in less time.

### Data Integration and Inheritance

Every building, regardless of its data sources, has a unique serial ID. The building complex is based on Facility Management (FM) data and has a unique ID, while the building wings share the same root and parent IDs, referring to the ID of the building complex. Individual parts of the building relate to the complex through their root ID and to the wing through their parent ID. This hierarchical structure allows for the inheritance of properties from the building complex to other parts, enabling the linking of CityGML geometry information to the building characteristics based on FM data, which is useful for visualization in GIS.

### Visualization and Data Queries

In addition to building thermal energy performance models, the 3D geometries stored in the EnEff:Campus database are crucial for visualizing campus properties. Geometric information from laser scanning (in CityGML format) and 3D building geometries created by SketchUp Make are used for visualization. By expanding the "3D City database" with the "Energy ADE," it is possible to assign energy consumption data to building geometries and visualize this content geographically. For example, the following SQL command can be used:

```sql
SELECT 
    time_series_regular_test.id,
    surface_geometry.geometry,
    surface_geometry.height,
    building.measured_height,
    ...
    building_energy.year_of_construction,
    ...
    time_series_regular.values
FROM 
    public.building,
    ...
    public.time_series,
    public.time_series_regular,
    public.surface_geometry
WHERE 
    ...
    building_energy.id_building_campus = building_campus.campus_building_parent_id
    AND
    ...
    thematic_surface.building_id = building.id
    AND
    ...
    thematic_surface.lod2_multi_surface_id
    AND
    thematic_surface.type = 'GroundSurface';
```

This code matches geometrical representations of the buildings to their specific properties stored in the "building_energy" table, allowing for a geographical distribution of the year of construction of the campus buildings, as illustrated in Figure 5.

### Limitations and Discussion

Minimizing potential sources of error is a significant challenge due to the project's complexity. The quality of the provided data determines the quality of the simulation results. Verification of physical input parameters, design restrictions, and environmental conditions is crucial. Hopfe and Hensen [2011] suggested methods like sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to identify and address uncertainties. Unrecognized relations, such as user behavior and process heat usage, can significantly influence results. Detailed comparative simulations are conducted to determine systematic errors, and statistical tests are performed to compare random samples with empirical data from on-site visits.

### Conclusion

The development of this integrated database-driven approach enables researchers to gather and store comprehensive information about the entire energy cycle in one place. This data allows for different viewpoints on energy efficiency and production demand balance, leading to optimized solutions even in an ongoing process of adapting to ever-changing environmental and user-related restrictions.
