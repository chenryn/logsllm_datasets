### Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Command-Line Options

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

Using the `mmc` command-line options, you can open a specific MMC console, open MMC in author mode, or specify whether the 32-bit or 64-bit version of MMC is used.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
mmc <console_file> [/a] [/64] [/32]
```

#### Parameters
- **`<console_file>`**: Specifies the path and file name of the saved console. If not provided, a new console will be opened.
- **`/a`**: Opens the specified console in author mode, allowing you to make changes to the saved console.
- **`/64`**: Opens the 64-bit version of MMC. Use this option only on 64-bit operating systems when you need to use 64-bit snap-ins.
- **`/32`**: Opens the 32-bit version of MMC. This is useful on 64-bit operating systems when you need to use 32-bit snap-ins.

#### Remarks
- **Environment Variables**: You can use environment variables to create command lines or shortcuts that do not depend on the explicit location of console files. For example, if the path to a console file is in the system folder (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32\console_name.msc`), you can use the expandable data string `%systemroot%` to specify the location (e.g., `mmc %systemroot%\System32\console_name.msc`). This is particularly useful when delegating tasks to users on different computers.
- **Author Mode**: When consoles are opened with the `/a` option, they are opened in author mode, regardless of their default mode. This does not permanently change the default mode setting for the console file. When the `/a` option is omitted, MMC opens the console according to its default mode settings.
- **Opening Consoles in Author Mode**: After opening MMC or a console file in author mode, you can open any existing console by selecting "Open" from the "Console" menu.
- **Creating Shortcuts**: You can use the command line to create shortcuts for opening MMC and saved consoles. These commands work with the "Run" command on the Start menu, in any command-prompt window, in shortcuts, or in batch files and programs that call the command.

This guide should help you effectively use the `mmc` command-line options to manage and customize your Microsoft Management Console experience.
