User: I'm using os.popen(cmd) to connect to a database with isql. This is in Unix, Python version 2.3.4. I'm trying to implement error handling, and I'm wondering if there's
an efficient way to capture errors/exceptions raised by called subprocesses such as this, without dealing with stderr, etc.
Thanks,
Dan
Assistant: No. All you get is 

whatever comes over the pipe returned from popen 
the exit code of the child process when you pclose the process.
