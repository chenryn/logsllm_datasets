select the 75 genotypes corresponding to these methylation
proﬁles. Then, we randomly select 37 pairs for the training
set, and 38 for the testing set, or attack set. We repeat the
random splitting 100 times.
In the second setup, (b), we want to make sure that there
are no individuals in the training and testing sets who have
familial relationships, i.e., we want to avoid a child being in
the training set, and his mother being in the test set, or the
other way around. We also aim at 37 samples in the training
set and 38 in the test set. Thus, we ﬁrst randomly select from
2 to 18 mother-child pairs to be included in the training set,
which leads us to 4 to 36 samples. Then, we randomly select
the remaining samples among the isolated individuals (i.e.,
those who have no child or mother in our dataset) to attain
37 samples. We repeat this random selection 100 times, and
select the 38 remaining proﬁles to be part of the test set. This
process ensures that there is no individual in the test set who
is member of the same family as somebody in the training set.
The third experimental setup, (c), is used for the scenarios
where we want to map more than one methylation proﬁle
at a time with the genotypes. In both previous settings, we
consider nm = 1 and ng = 75 (or more, as we will see
later), but we repeat the attack over all 38 methylation proﬁles
independently. Now, we want to match nm > 1 methylation
proﬁles to ng = 75 genotypes. We then select our samples in
order to maximize the number of methylation proﬁles in the
test set, as follows. We select all individuals at time t1 and at
time points t > t1 that do not have methylation proﬁles at t0
and t1. This gives us 16 methylation proﬁles at t1 plus 7 at
later time points, thus 23 methylation proﬁles for the training
set. Then, for the test set, we select all methylation proﬁles at
t 0 whose owners do not overlap with those in the training set.

This leads to 52 methylation proﬁles for the test set.
Note that the requirement of having two samples per geno-
type value to learn the variance of the normal distribution is
reducing the number of meQTL-methylation pairs when we
apply it to the training set and not the whole dataset. The
total number of pairs ranges from 237 to 248 with a median
value 240 in setup (a). It ranges from 208 to 236 with a median
of 222.5 for (b), and it is of 187 pairs for setup (c) for which
there is only one run and the number of samples in the training
set is smaller (due to stronger constraints).
C. Results
We start by showing the performance of the attack with all
available meQTL-methylation pairs (given the aforementioned
constraints), nm = 1 and ng = 75. We include all 75 indi-
vidual genotypes to be potentially matched to the methylation
proﬁles as we assume that this can only make the attack harder
for the adversary than considering only the 38 or 52 genotypes
corresponding to the methylation proﬁles of the test set. Of
course, we only select the 38 methylation proﬁles present in
the test set to run our experiments. Therefore, we try to match
one methylation proﬁle with 75 genotypes, 38 times, over 100
runs, i.e., 3,800 times, and average the results.
Fig. 2 shows: (i) the matching accuracy, i.e., the fraction
of pairs containing genotypes and methylation proﬁles of the
same individual, (ii) the true-positive rate (TPR) after applying
the z-score test, i.e., the number of true matchings divided by
the sum of the number of true matching pairs and the number
of matching pairs that are wrongly identiﬁed as non-matching,
and (iii) the false-positive rate (FPR) after applying the z-score
test, i.e., the number of false mappings that are identiﬁed as
true divided by the sum of the latter value and the number of
true mappings identiﬁed as false. We could have also depicted
other metrics, such as accuracy after z-score, but we consider
the TPR and FPR as sufﬁcient metrics to depict the success
of the identiﬁcation attack.
First, Fig. 2 shows that, on average, the attack accurately
matches the methylation proﬁle to its corresponding genotypes
around 97.5% of the time. Then, we notice that, there exists a
z-score for which, given a certain matching, we always reject
all wrongly matched pairs (FPR = 0 for z-score approximately
greater than 5), and never reject those that are correct (TPR =
1 for z-score approximately smaller than 5.5). This means that
for the 2.5% of the pairs that are wrongly matched, we are
able to identify that they are false positives. Finally, we notice
that the matching accuracy is the same for both scenarios (a)
and (b), and that the FPR and TPR are also very similar.
that
Fig. 3 shows the attack when there are more than one
methylation proﬁles to match to their genotypes. Speciﬁcally,
given the experimental setup (c), we have 52 methylation
proﬁles that we try to match again to the whole 75 genotypes.
First of all, we notice that the matching accuracy is 100%,
i.e.,
the attack correctly matches the 52 methylation-
meQTL pairs. Then, by looking at the z-score to validate the
matched pairs, we note that it starts rejecting valid pairs from
around 5.2. As we only have correctly matched pairs after the
matching algorithm, there is no point in displaying the FPR
because there is no wrong pair to reject. We conclude from
Fig. 2 and 3 that the attack is more successful when matching
more than one methylation proﬁle to multiple genotypes.
Next, we evaluate the impact of reducing the number
of methylation-meQTL pairs on the attack success. In this
endeavor, we gradually use an increasing number of observed
methylation-meQTL pairs, from 1 to 237, in decreasing order
of correlation. Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the matching
accuracy and of the TPR after applying the z-test, for three
possible FPR vaues: 0, 0.05, and 0.1. First, we notice that
we reach the maximum matching accuracy with only 20
methylation-meQTL pairs, and almost 90% accuracy with 10

pairs. Second, we see that we attain a TPR of 0.6 at a FPR of
0.05 when we apply the z-test (at 10 pairs). Furthermore, we
reach a 0.95 TPR at 0.05 FPR with 20 methylation-meQTL
pairs, and 0.99 with 30 pairs.
When evaluating the same experiment with a ﬁxed threshold
of 5.5 (as found suitable in Fig. 2), we notice that 80
methylation-meQTL pairs are necessary to achieve a TPR of
almost 0.9 and a FPR of 0. This arises from the fact that
a larger number of methylation-meQTL pairs provides more
information and thus gives a more accurate match score, which
also allows for higher z-score thresholds to perform better.
Similarly, Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the various metrics
with respect to an increasing number of observed methylation-
meQTL pairs, for nm = 52. The less smooth behavior of the
curves is due to the fact that we have one run here compared
to 100 runs in the case where nm = 1. We notice here
that the matching accuracy and TPRs reach highest values
for a number of methylation-meQTL pairs that is lower than
when nm = 1. Precisely, the attack reaches full accuracy
and TPR at 0 false-positives with only 13 pairs. Again, we
see that matching more than one methylation proﬁles to their
corresponding genotypes induces higher attack success.
We evaluate now how the attack performance evolves when
the genotype corresponding to the targeted methylation proﬁle
is not present in the genotype dataset. We have ng = 74
genotypes if the targeted genotype is not present and, for the
sake of comparison, we keep the same number when it is
present, by removing another of the 74 genotypes at random.
Fig. 6 shows the evolution of this performance with respect to
an increasing probability that the targeted genotype is in the
dataset, from 0 to 1, by intervals of 0.01. For each probability
value x, we randomly generate a value v between 0 and 1,
uniformly, and keep the targeted genotype in the dataset if
and only if v < x. We repeat this sampling process 100 times

and average its outcomes. As expected, the matching accuracy
increases with the probability that the correct genotype is
present in the dataset. The adversary cannot ﬁnd the correct
genotype if it is not there. The crucial point here is that
the adversary can detect
the genotype is not present
for any presence probability. Indeed, with the appropriate z-
score (between 4.9 and 5.4), the adversary always rejects
the wrongly matched genotypes (FPR=0) while accepting the
correctly matched genotypes (TPR=1).
that
We also investigate the effect of a relative’s genotype being
in the genotype dataset, with a varying presence probability
of the targeted genotype, as in Fig. 6. The relative here is
either the mother or the child of this mother. Fig. 7 shows

the percentage of times the relative’s genotype is matched to
the methylation proﬁle, in absolute value, and relative to the
condition that the matched pair was wrong, and the percentage
of times this wrongly matched pairs were rejected by the z-test.
First, we observe a linear decrease of the probability of being
matched to the relative with respect to the presence probability.
We also see that this curve does not start at 1 but at around
0.7. This means that, when the targeted genotype is not in the
dataset, the wrongly matched genotype is in 70% of the cases
the relative’s genotype, and in the 30% remaining cases the
one of an unrelated individual.
In order to better understand these proportions, we display
the fraction of familial matches among all wrong matches
(green dashed curve). We observe that this fraction increases
with the presence probability. In order to understand this
behavior, we must recall
the matching accuracy also
increases with the presence probability. This means, that the
fewer wrong matched pairs there are, the more likely these
are pairs containing the genotype of a relative and not of an
unrelated individual. Also, it means that, when the chance that
the targeted genotype is present in the dataset is high, the
only genotype that can mislead the adversary’s matching is
the relative’s genotype in the vast majority of cases.
that
Finally, we study the robustness of our attack for an increas-
ing number of genotypes, from 75 to 2579, by including the
2504 genotypes of the 1000 Genomes Project (phase 3) [31].
Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the matching accuracy, of the
false-positive and true-positive rates after the z-test, of the
minimum z-score for reaching a null FPR. First, we notice
that the matching accuracy remains constant, at 97.5%, for
all genotype dataset’s size ng. Moreover, there always exists
a z-score that enables us to reject all wrongly matched pairs
while keeping all correctly matched pairs. We notably notice
that this z-score evolves quite a lot until around ng = 1000 and
that it tends to converge to a ﬁxed value when ng gets closer
to 2579. We conclude from this ﬁgure that the identiﬁcation
attack is very robust to an increase in the number of genotypes
we have to match the methylation proﬁle to.
We also evaluated this experiment with ﬁxed thresholds
on the z-score. When less than 100 genotypes are present,
a threshold of 5.5 provides a TPR of 1 and FPRs below
0.05. When more than 100 genotypes are part of the test
set, a threshold of 6 achieves the same effect. Since these
observations conform with previous experiments, we believe
that an adversary is able to determine a suitable threshold from
her training data.
VII. PRIVATE CLASSIFICATION WITH RANDOM FORESTS
As we have shown, publicly releasing methylation proﬁles
has a huge detrimental effect on the patients’ privacy, with a
risk close to 100% to have one’s methylation data re-identiﬁed.
Therefore, we ﬁrst strongly recommend to reconsider if the ex-
isting DNA methylation datasets should remain publicly avail-
able in online databases. Moreover, it is vital to understand the
needs of the medical community for designing appropriate
protection mechanisms that provide privacy guarantees and
diagnosis utility to the patients. In this section, we propose
a novel cryptographic scheme for privately classifying tumors
based on random forests. We ﬁrst describe the preliminaries
on random forests, and then present our private random forest-
based classiﬁer.
Random forests are a promising technique used in the med-
ical community for classifying diseases [32]. This ensemble
method bases its classiﬁcation on a multitude of classiﬁcation
trees in order to prevent overﬁtting and to reduce the prediction
variance [33]. Danielsson et al. for example developed a
random forest classiﬁer tool enabling the identiﬁcation of
pediatric brain tumor subtypes with an accuracy of 98% [34].

In practice, when diagnosing a patient’s disease, a sample
is taken from the patient by a medical practitioner. Then, the
sample needs to be analyzed either by the hospital or by a
medical laboratory, resulting, e.g., in the DNA methylation
proﬁle of the patient. The actual classiﬁcation based on
these data can then be outsourced to a third-party company
providing data-driven medicine, such as Sophia Genetics [35].
The DNA methylation proﬁle is sent to the third party, which
then provides the diagnosis to the physician or hospital. While
the business model of this third party is inherently protected
by keeping the classiﬁcation model secret, the patient’s privacy
is clearly at risk, as his data are available to the third party.
Hence, when classifying a patient’s disease, two privacy
goals must be achieved: (1) protecting the company’s clas-
siﬁcation model, and (2) protecting the patient’s data from
the third-party company. Note that, in order to construct its
classiﬁer, the company must have access to a training set of
DNA methylation data in clear. Our scheme protects the data
on which only classiﬁcation has to be carried out (e.g., for
diagnostic purposes). Finally, our scheme is ﬂexible in the
sense that it can release two outcomes: (i) only the class with
the plurality vote (most frequently chosen by the random forest
algorithm), or (ii) the class of every tree in the random forest,
which enables the medical practitioner to carry a more ﬁne-
grained analysis of the distribution over the possible classes.
A. Preliminaries
1) Classiﬁcation Trees: Classiﬁcation trees (or decision
trees) are a popular, predictive tool
in machine learning,
used to classify an input (cid:2)v into a set of different classes
Y = {y0, . . . , yk}. As the name suggests, a classiﬁcation tree
can be represented by a simple, usually binary tree, in which
each interior node corresponds to an input value vi. The two
