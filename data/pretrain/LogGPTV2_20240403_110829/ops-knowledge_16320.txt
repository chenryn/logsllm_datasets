Question: Reflect on the use of a constraint solver such as STP during the execution of the EXE symbolic execution tool. What potential issues could arise if EXE did not utilize STP to verify the existence of at least one solution for the current path's constraints, and instead opted for alternative methods such as trying all branches or randomly selecting a branch?
"A": "Without STP, EXE might waste computational resources on infeasible paths that do not contribute to finding bugs.",
"B": "Randomly selecting a branch without verification might lead EXE to overlook certain bugs due to incomplete coverage of the execution space.",
"C": "Trying all branches without STP could result in an exponential increase in the complexity, making the execution process impractical for larger programs.",
"D": "Utilizing a random branch selection strategy would significantly speed up the execution process by reducing the number of paths to be explored."
Answer: ABC
