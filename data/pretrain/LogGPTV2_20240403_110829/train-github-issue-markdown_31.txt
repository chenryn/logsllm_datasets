  * **Electron Version:**

  * **Last Known Working Electron version:** : 
    * 4.x (latest)
### Expected Behavior
When I perfrom a GET-request using `http` or `https` built-in library, I
expect the app to keep running after the request completes.
### Actual Behavior
When performing a GET request to an arbitrary host, the app crashes after **a
few seconds after completing the request**. Usually ranges between 5 and 20
seconds.
### To Reproduce
https://github.com/haroldiedema/electron-5x-http-crash
    $ git clone https://github.com/haroldiedema/electron-5x-http-crash
    $ npm install
    $ node_modules/.bin/electron .
Sit back and wait for a few seconds for the app to crash with exit code 127.
(or exit code 1 if started from npm or yarn).
### Screenshots
N/A
### Additional Information
I think this might have something to do with either:  
A) Electron not handling the closing of sockets correctly anymore, or  
B) The garbage collector kicking in and cleaning up the socket resource which
makes electron crash.
Then again, that is purely speculation on my end.
