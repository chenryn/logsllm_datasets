### Current Behavior:
When using npm@7, if the folder name in which the project is being built
_matches_ the name of the project in `package.json`, a `name` property is
actively removed (or never set) from package-lock.json.
If the project folder does _not_ match the name in `package.json` then the
property is actively set.

This is a change controlled file by definition. At the very least, this can
cause thrashing of `package-lock.json` if multiple developers are working on
the same project and their working copies are in different folders.
### Expected Behavior:
The folder in which a project is checked out on the local file system should
have _zero_ bearing on the content of `package-lock.json`.
### Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Check out a project into a folder with a name that matches the name of the package.
  2. Do an `npm install`
  3. Check the content of `package-lock.json` and confirm that odd `name` property _does not_ exist.
  4. Rename the project folder to something that does _not_ match the name of the package.
  5. Do an `npm install`
  6. Note that `package-lock.json" changes.
  7. Open `package-lock.json` and confirm that odd `name` property _does_ exist.
### Environment:
