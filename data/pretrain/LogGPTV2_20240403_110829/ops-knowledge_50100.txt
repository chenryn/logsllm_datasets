User: Is there any way in celery by which if a task execution fails I can automatically put it into another queue.
For example it the task is running in a queue x, on exception enqueue it to another queue named error_x
Edit:
Currently I am using celery==3.0.13 along with django 1.4, Rabbitmq as broker.
Some times the task fails. Is there a way in celery to add messages to an error queue and process it later.
The problem when celery task fails is that I don't have access to the message queue name. So I can't use self.retry retry to put it to a different error queue.
Assistant: I had a similar problem and i solved it may be not in a most efficient way but however my solution is as follows:
I have created a django model to keep all my celery task-ids and that is capable of checking the task state.
Then i have created another celery task that is running in an infinite cycle and checks all tasks that are 'RUNNING' on their actual state and if the state is 'FAILED' it just reruns it. Im not actually changing the queue for the task which i rerun but i think you can implement some custom logic to decide where to put every task you rerun this way.
