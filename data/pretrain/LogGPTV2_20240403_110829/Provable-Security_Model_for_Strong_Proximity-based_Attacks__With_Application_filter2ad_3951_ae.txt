look that C was close to the reader R when it was not. Moreover,
this adversary, during the attack, has access to cards other than
C which it can move around, and to readers other than R. Also, it

Definition 4.4. Strong Distance-Fraud Security. For a given
v-DB protocol Π, the (ℓ, z, n, qC, qR, qT, card−coupled )-v-DB exper-
iment gives the game for strong distance-fraud over Π of the
same parameters.
If the advantage of the adversary is negligible is this game, then we
say that Π is secure w.r.t. strong distance-fraud.
In this case, A is a strong man-in-the-middle who controls the
PC algorithm onboard a card C, and may control C itself. It at-
tempts the make the attester W accept a transcript when the card
C was far from the reader, but PC algorithm lied about this fact (i.e,
= 1). In other words, the attacker corrupts a PC-coupled

proximity-checking card C inside a v-DB protocol and try to use this
card to mount a distance-fraud that the attester would not catch.
The rest of the aspects (i.e., learning phases, etc.) stay the same as
in the game for strong relaying, only that readers are uniformly
replaced with cards.

Note that because in PayCCR, it is the AC-producing card that has
the validating algorithm on board (as opposed to PayBCR, where this
AC needs to be sent by the card to the validating bank), the require-
ments for PayCCR’s security w.r.t. strong relaying are weaker than
those of PayBCR. I.e., the security of AC plays no role in PayCCR’s
security w.r.t. strong relaying. This imbalance will be inverted if
we look at auditing authentication properties as well. In this case,
it is will be PayBCR that achieves better guarantees w.r.t. strong,
collusive attacks against authentication. This is discussed further
in Section 5.
5 OTHER DISCUSSIONS
5.1 v-DB, PayBCR, PayCCR: Further Security
Discussions
When looking at v-DB , it is important to note that we defined secu-
rity for only the properties of strong relaying and strong distance-
fraud. As such, we may wish to look at a primitive that can give
assurances of both proximity checking and authentication. This
would be comprised by having a “validating" party W to re-check
the proximity measurement and “auditing” party, say F , to re-check
the authentication part. This split would clearly also open for other
coupling options than in v-DB. For instance, PayCCR has the val-
idator for the proximity checking with one party (that is, on the
card side) and the auditor for authentication with another party
(that is, on the bank side). Contrarily, with PayBCR , the auditor for
authentication and the validator for proximity checking validation
occur both with the same party (i.e., on the bank’s side).
We now define such a protocol.
Definition 5.1. Validated & Audited Distance-Bounding Pro-
tocols. A validated and audited distance-bounding (v-ADB) protocol
is a tuple Π = (C,R, T , PC,W, F , B), where B denotes the dis-
tance bound and C,R, T , PC,W, F are ppt. algorithms as follows:
• C is the card algorithm and R is the reader algorithm in an
unilateral authentication protocol where C authenticates to
R;
• T is a tamper-resistant trusted execution environment;
• the tuple (PC, T ) form a proximity-checking functionality:
(PC, T ) checks that dist (C,R) ≤ B;
• tuple (PC, T ) is directly used by one authentication party:
be it by C or by R;
• R and (PC, T ) respectively have public outputs OutR and
in {0, 1} (success/failure of the authentication
Out(PC,T )
and proximity-checking respectively), as well as private out-
puts denoting their transcripts, denoted τR and, resp., τPC;
• W is the proximity-validating algorithm: given the private
output of (PC, T ), the algorithm W checks the correctness
of public output of (PC, T ).
• F is the authentication-auditing algorithm: given the private
output of R, the algorithm F checks the correctness of the
public output of R
Security in this setting can be defined in various ways, some
stronger than others. E.g., we can say that a v-ADB protocol Π has
strong MiM v-ADB-security if for all cards C (x ) far away from
potentially malicious readers R(y), their authentication fails to be
audited by F with input from R(y) and W fails to validated C (x )
was close to R(y) (even if the output of corrupted PC is 1). Clearly,
similarly we can defined strong v-ADB-distance-fraud, but where
the card may be malicious instead of the reader. Of course, this
would need to be cast in threat model akin to ours but where more
authentication-forging powers are given to the adversary. We leave
this for future work.
Collusive relaying, as informally defined in [7], is a property
that is stronger then the property of strong relaying defined for
v − DB, but weaker than strong MiM v-ADB-security. It requires
intuitively that if F audits successfully an authentication, then this
Session 2: Authentication ASIA CCS '20, October 5–9, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan97authentication is for a card that was close to a reader, even if the
reader and the PC algorithm may be malicious.
v-ADB Security: Protocol Comparisons. As we explained al-
ready, Def 5.1 makes a difference for PayCCR but not for PayBCR.
Concretely, in PayBCR F and W are on the same device (i.e., the
bank), but in PayCCR, F is one party (i.e., bank) and W is another
party (i.e., the card). In turn, this intuitively makes PayCCR weaker
than PayCCR. More specifically, assume a card C that is far-away
from a reader R. In PayCCR, we have that [PC,T ] is coupled with
the reader, and W coupled with the C. Even if W is coupled with
the card, the AC produced by the card will not contain the failed
checks by W. (The latter is because, in PayCCR, the AC is kept
unchanged compared to RRP; also, the AC is to go to F , and –as
such– the AC need not contain proximity-checking details but only
authentication details). This AC will be sent to the reader who will
send it to the bank. So, the bank authenticates a far-away card, even
if the auditing W will report the proximity-checking failing. This
is an attack against strong MiM v-ADB-security informally exhibited
onto PayCCR. Because, in PayBCR, F and W are kept on the same
device, this vulnerability does not occur.
6 RELATED WORK
Models for “standard DB”. Most distance-bounding protocols
have been analysed without a formal approach. From 2013 on-
wards, efforts have been made on proving security for distance-
bounding [11, 13, 14]. The first formalism in this direction was put
forward by Dürholz et al [11]. The authors formalise the impossibil-
ity of illegitimate yet sufficiently fast round-trip communications
using a session-based model, and specifically the notion of tainted
sessions; to encode timing-restrictions, tainted sessions only allow
certain flows of communication. Then, a protocol is said to be se-
cure if no adversary executing it with tainted sessions can violate
its security properties. The model comprises a formalisation of
all the classical DB frauds and provides several (partial) security
proofs for some protocols [11]. In [14], the authors provide a rather
general, ITM-based model that captures the notion of concurrency
(i.e., allowing adversaries to interact with many provers and veri-
fiers, sometimes with the same keys). Here, the notion of timing
is explicit, the round trip time is simply the difference between
two times. The notion of distance is also defined in a similar way.
All parties are located in Euclidian space with a distance between
them defined in the usual manner. As such the explicit measure of
time can be used to estimate the distance between two parties to
compare with a distance bound.
In this paper, we use a mix of both of these ideas. We use oracles
in the sense of Dürholz et al [13], but we also make use of explicit
timing and distances as in [14].
Security Models for Distance-Bounding Augmented with
Hardware. In [15], a “three-algorithm symmetric DB protocol” is
defined as a tuple of (K, V , P, B, H ), where K is the key genera-
tion algorithm, H is the hardware algorithm, V is the verifying
algorithm, P is the prover algorithm and B is the distance bound.
However, the trusted hardware H is always attached to (or in our
terms, “coupled with”) the Prover, whereas in our model the se-
cure element is coupled with the proximity-checking algorithm PC,
and this PC can in turn be coupled with either the card (prover)
or the reader (verifier). This makes our model more versatile and
expressive. Also, ultimately, the aims of [15] are very different to
ours: they wish to protect against a specific attack in DB, called
terrorist-fraud; the latter has no substantial relation to our notions
of strong relaying and strong distance-fraud.
Security Models for Relay-Protected Contactless Payments.
In [16], Kilinç and Vaudenay introduce a model for contactless
payments with relay-protection. This model is distinct to the model
herein, in ways others that the one herein is generic and the one
in [16] is specific to payments. The major difference is that the
reader is always trusted.
7 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we set to answer the question of what it would for-
mally mean to catch if RTT-measuring parties (readers, cards, or
others) cheat and collude with proximity-based attackers (i.e., relay-
ers or other types). To this end, we gave a new distance-bounding
primitive (validated distance-bounding) and two new security no-
tions: strong relaying and strong distance-fraud. We also provided a
formal model that, for the first time in distance-bounding, caters
for dishonest RTT-measurers. In this model, we proved that the
new contactless payments in [7], PayBCR and PayCCR attain secu-
rity w.r.t. strong relaying. Finally, we define one other primitive
(validated and audited distance-bounding) which, in fact, emulates
more closely the PayCCR protocol; this is because, contrary to the
line introducing them, we note that PayBCR and PayCCR in fact
differ in construction and security guarantees that go past relaying
and into authentication. In future work, we plan to study further
formal security (now just sketched) alongside validated and audited
distance-bounding.
