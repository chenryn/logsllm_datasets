The x86_64 binaries for Linux are probably built with march that is not
x86-64. As a consequence, CPU instructions that are not supported by old Intel
x86_64 CPUs are produced.
The binaries are not able to run on an x86-64 Linux system with an Intel
Pentium 4 Prescott HT630 CPU, for example. The GCC march for that CPU is
nocona. Could you double check what march is set to compile LLVM and
consequently Julia, which produced the x86_64 binaries for Linux?
This bug also affects packages that download libraries (such as gdal), when
these libraries are compiled with an march setting that is not x86-64.
I have been able to produce a working x86_64 binary of Julia by compiling
Julia using march=x86-64 on the old Intel CPU. However, I do not know how to
fix the ready compiled libraries that are downloaded from servers when adding
packages.
