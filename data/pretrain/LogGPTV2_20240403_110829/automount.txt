### Automount

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Important:**
In storage area network (SAN) configurations, disabling the automount feature prevents Windows from automatically mounting or assigning drive letters to any new basic volumes that are visible to the system.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
automount [ { enable | disable | scrub } ] [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **enable** | Enables Windows to automatically mount new basic and dynamic volumes that are added to the system and to assign them drive letters. |
| **disable** | Prevents Windows from automatically mounting any new basic and dynamic volumes that are added to the system. <br> **Note:** Disabling automount can cause failover clusters to fail the storage portion of the Validate a Configuration Wizard. |
| **scrub** | Removes volume mount point directories and registry settings for volumes that are no longer in the system. This prevents volumes that were previously in the system from being automatically mounted and given their former volume mount points when they are added back to the system. |
| **noerr** | For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit with an error code. |

**Examples:**

1. **To check if the automount feature is enabled:**
   ```plaintext
   diskpart
   automount
   ```

2. **To enable the automount feature:**
   ```plaintext
   diskpart
   automount enable
   ```

3. **To disable the automount feature:**
   ```plaintext
   diskpart
   automount disable
   ```

**Note:**
Disabling the automount feature can cause failover clusters to fail the storage portion of the Validate a Configuration Wizard.
