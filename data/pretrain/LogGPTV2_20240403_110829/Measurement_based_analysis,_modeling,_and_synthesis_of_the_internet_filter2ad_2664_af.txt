### Replicas for an Object

Our system comprises a 4000-node network (3997 nodes used for measured data) and a total of 10,000 objects. Figure 16(a) illustrates that the average query latency for a given number of replicas is significantly lower when using measured delay, especially in comparison to Inet. This phenomenon is due to the different distributions of hop lengths, as shown in Figure 15(b). In realistic models, the last hops often dominate the total overlay path, so even a small number of replicas can substantially reduce the average latency. Without realistic models, one might overestimate the number of replicas needed to achieve a specific target lookup latency.

### Evaluation of Query Traffic Distribution

Next, we evaluate the distribution of query traffic to the replicas. In this scenario, we assume that objects are replicated on all nodes that match at least one digit with the object identifier. Given a network of 4000 nodes with Pastry node IDs in base 16, this corresponds to approximately 250 replicas per object (i.e., \( \frac{1}{16} \times 4000 = 250 \)). Figure 16(b) shows the distribution of query load among the replicas. A point (x, y) in the plot indicates that the x lowest-ranked nodes, in terms of the amount of query traffic they served, together serve y% of the overall query traffic. The figure highlights a significant imbalance in the load distribution for the Inet topology model, where 5% of the nodes serve over 50% of the traffic. This imbalance is caused by the highly skewed overlay indegree distribution of nodes in the Inet topology.

### Impact of Delay Models

We observe that the delay model used in simulations of distributed systems significantly impacts the results obtained for key application performance metrics. Inadequate delay models can lead to incorrect conclusions about the effectiveness and performance of systems.

### Related Work

Our work on modeling the Internet delay space complements existing research on network connectivity topologies. Future work could incorporate delay space characteristics into these topology models.

Early artificial network topologies had straightforward connectivity structures such as tree, star, or ring. A more sophisticated topology model based on the random graph model was proposed by Waxman [45]. As the hierarchical nature of the Internet became apparent, more accurate models like Transit-Stub by Calvert et al. [48] and Tier by Doar [8] were developed. Faloutsos et al. [10] studied real Internet topology traces and discovered the power-law node degree distribution of the Internet. Li et al. [18] further integrated router capacity constraints with the power-law node degree model to create more realistic router-level topologies.

Several ongoing projects actively collect Internet delay measurements, including Skitter [38], AMP [2], PingER [27], and Surveyor [42]. These projects typically use a set of monitoring nodes (ranging from 20 to 100) to probe a set of destinations. Skitter, the largest project, probes around 1 million destinations. Active monitoring methods can probe any destination in the network but cover only a small subset of the delay space. Many of these measurements are continuously collected, allowing the study of changes in delay over time. Our work uses the King tool to collect delay measurements, which restricts the probed nodes to DNS servers, producing a symmetric delay space matrix suitable for studying stationary delay space characteristics.

Some delay space properties reported in this paper have been observed in previous work. For example, triangle inequality violations and routing inefficiencies have been noted in [34] and [24]. However, many of our observations are new, including local clustering properties, exponential in-degree distribution, spatial growth properties, detailed properties of triangle inequality violations, and their examination under scaling. Previous work has also studied the temporal properties of Internet delay [1]. Incorporating these temporal properties into a delay space model is an area for future work.

A key technique in our work is computing a low-dimensional Euclidean embedding of the delay space to enhance the completeness and scalability of the delay space representation. Various approaches for computing such embeddings have been studied [24, 7, 35, 6, 19, 43, 36, 26]. We have not considered the impact of using different computation methods or embedding objective functions, which represents another area for future work.

### Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically analyze, model, and synthesize the Internet delay space. We quantify the properties of the Internet delay space with respect to a set of metrics relevant to distributed systems design, leading to new insights into the characteristics of the Internet delay space. We also develop a set of techniques to model and synthesize the Internet delay space compactly while accurately preserving all relevant metrics. The result is an Internet delay space synthesizer called DS2, which can produce realistic delay spaces at large scale. DS2 requires only \( O(N) \) memory, where N is the number of nodes, and simple runtime calculations to generate the delay between a pair of nodes. This helps address the memory requirement barrier in large-scale simulations. DS2 provides an important mechanism for simulating and emulating distributed systems at large scale, complementing other evaluation methodologies. For further information on DS2, see [9].
