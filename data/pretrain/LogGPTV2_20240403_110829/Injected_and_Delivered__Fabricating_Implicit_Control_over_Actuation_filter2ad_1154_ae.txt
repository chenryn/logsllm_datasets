signs. Therefore, the countermeasures we discuss mainly
focus on two aspects: (1) Damping and isolation. These
approaches mitigate acoustic or vibrational noises phys-
ically.
(2) Filtering and sampling. These approaches
eliminate or mitigate malicious signals in the signal con-
ditioning circuits.
Damping and Isolation. Early mitigation approaches
against acoustic interferences include using isolating
boxes and acoustic foams to surround the sensor [41].
The simple strategy could achieve substantial protection
from acoustic noises, but issues in size and design con-
cerning an embedded environment were not addressed.
To protect MEMS inertial sensors without compro-
mising their advantages in size, weight, power, and cost
(SWaP-C [48]), recent studies have been dedicated to us-
ing micro-level techniques for acoustic isolation. Dean
et al. proposed the use of microﬁbrous metallic cloth
as an acoustic damping material to protect MEMS gyro-
scopes [43]. Soobramaney et al. evaluated the mitigation
effects of microﬁbrous cloth on noise signals induced in
MEMS gyros under acoustic interferences [65]. They
tested 7 MEMS gyros and showed that, by surrounding
the sensor with 12 mm of the media, 65% reduction in
the amplitude of noise signals can be easily obtained and
up to 90% reduction could be achieved [65]. Addition-
ally, Yunker et al. suggested to use MEMS fabricated
acoustic metamaterial to mitigate acoustic signals at fre-
quencies close to the resonant frequency of the MEMS
gyroscope [76]. Furthermore, Kranz et al. showed that
a MEMS-fabricated micro-isolator can be applied within
the sensor packaging but their work mainly focused on
isolating mechanical vibrations [48].
Filtering. As suggested in [68], a low-pass ﬁlter (LPF)
should be used to eliminate the out-of-band analog sig-
nals. According to the datasheets [30, 28], we ﬁnd that
many inertial sensors have an analog LPF in their cir-
cuits, but are still vulnerable to acoustic attacks, which
could be due to a cut-off frequency that is set too high.
We also ﬁnd that most programmable inertial sensors use
a digital LPF for bandwidth control [27, 29]. However,

igation system with automatic Switching attacks on the

Evaluation. We evaluate our attacks on a Huawei Honor
V8 smartphone and demonstrate the attack effects with
a mobile navigation system (Google Maps). In mobile
navigation systems, inertial sensors are often used to aid
the GPS system to provide a more timely and accurate
positioning service. The gyroscope is often used to de-
termine the orientation of the system.
We implement the automatic attack method in an An-
droid application. The application utilizes the smart-
phone’s built-in speaker to generate ultrasonic signals
and surreptitiously manipulate the gyroscope data while
running in the background. As shown in Figure 13, we
ﬁrst induce positive outputs in the Z-axis of gyro and
the navigation system is tricked to rotate its orientation
counter-clockwisely. The accumulated heading angle is
6.85 rads in 32 seconds. After we change the target direc-
tion, the navigation system is deceived by negative out-
puts and rotates the orientation clockwisely. The accu-
mulated heading angle is -6.82 rads in about 31 seconds.
Our results show that, with real-time sensor data,
spooﬁng attacks on inertial sensors could manipulate the
orientation of a navigation system. When the displayed
orientation of a navigation system is manipulated, users
or systems guided by the navigation information could
be led to a wrong path. Additionally, for areas not well
covered by GPS or situations when the GPS signal is
jammed or spoofed [56, 60], errors in the orientation
information will not be effectively calibrated and could
cause more troubles to the positioning service.
Several recent approaches have been proposed to con-
trol the access to inertial sensors in smartphones, but
with a focus on privacy issues [59, 63]. Our automatic
attack also demonstrates that unprotected inertial sensor
data could be leveraged to manipulate the sensor output.
Our results conﬁrm that protection mechanisms over in-

because out-of-band analog signals have already been
aliased to in-band signals after sampling.
Sampling. Trippel et al. proposed randomized sampling
and 180◦ out-of-phase sampling methods for inertial sen-
sors with analog outputs and software controlled ADCs
[68]. These approaches were designed to eliminate an
attacker’s ability to achieve a DC signal alias and limit
potential adversarial control. However, adding a random-
ized delay to each sampling period or computing the av-
erage of two samples at a 180◦ phase delay could degrade
the accuracy of inertial measurements. Small errors in
the measurements could accumulate in a long time and
might affect the performance of the system.
We think an alternative sampling method to mitigate
potential adversarial control without degrading the per-
formance is to use a dynamic sample rate. Recall in (3)
and (4), the frequency ε of the induced digital signal de-
pends on both F and FS. With a dynamic FS, attackers
may not be able to induce a digital signal with a pre-
dictable frequency pattern.
In this case, the ability of
attackers will be limited and it could be difﬁcult for at-
tackers to accumulate a large heading angle in a target
direction. This might be a general mitigation method for
ADCs subject to out-of-band signal injections.
Additionally, redundancy-based approaches could en-
hance the resilience of the system. For example, multiple
sensors could still provide trustworthy information when
one of them is under attack. It might still be possible to
attack or interfere several sensors simultaneously to af-
fect the functioning of the system, but such attacks could
be more difﬁcult to implement.
In summary, acoustic attacks on inertial sensors are
enabled by two weaknesses in the analog domain: (1)
Susceptibility of the micro inertial sensing structure to
resonant sound.
(2) Incapability of signal condition-
ing circuits to handle out-of-band analog signals prop-
erly. Employing both acoustic damping and ﬁltering ap-
proaches in the designs of future sensors and systems can
address these weaknesses. Additionally, acoustic damp-
ing can also be used to mitigate the susceptibility of cur-
rently deployed sensors and systems to acoustic attacks.
8.2 Sound Source
Applications of sonic weapons [34], ultrasonic transduc-
ers [47], and long-range acoustic devices [18, 26] have
already shown the capability of specialized devices to
generate more powerful sound with a further transmit-
ting distance than common audio devices. In addition,
we ﬁnd several consumer-grade techniques that could be
used to optimize a sound source.
The most direct acoustic ampliﬁcation method is to
use speakers and ampliﬁers with better performance and
output capabilities. Besides, the sound played by com-
mon audio speakers usually diffuses into the air with lit-
tle directivity, leading to losses of acoustic energy. With
directivity horns [16, 19], the sound waves can be fo-
cused into a certain emitting area and transmit through a
longer distance. Another important approach is to use
multiple speakers to form a specialized speaker array.
With appropriate arrangement of speakers and directivity
horns to focus the sound waves, the sound strength, trans-
mitting distance, and emitting area of the sound source
could be customized and improved. Moreover, ultrasonic
transducers [73, 72] could have small sizes, variable res-
onant frequencies, and high efﬁciency. It might be pos-
sible to build a more powerful and efﬁcient sound source
by selecting and using a large number of transducers.
With multiple speakers or transducers,
the perfor-
mance of a sound source could be improved. If the sound
waves are in phase, the add-up SPL of n coherent sources
could be [25],
LΣ = 20log10(10
Lp1
20 + 10
Lp2
20 + ... + 10
Lpn
20 )
(28)
Assuming each coherent source is identical, we have
LΣ = 20log10(n) + Lp1
(29)
Theoretically, with 8 identical sources, the level in-
crease could be LΣ − Lp1 ≈ 18.0 dB. In practice, the per-
formance could also depend on arrangements of multi-
ple sources, designs of the enclosure and horns, and dif-
ferences in phases need to be considered and accommo-
dated. The distance attenuation of SPL can be quanti-
ﬁed by [23]: L(cid:48)
D(cid:48) ), where D and D(cid:48) are
distances. Therefore, a level increase of 18.0 dB could
increase the possible attack distance by a factor of 8.
p = Lp + 20log10( D
8.3 Limitations
Moving targets. Depending on the speed and range of
movements, it could be difﬁcult for attackers to follow
and aim a moving target while manually tuning acoustic
signals. It could be helpful to predict the movements and
align the sound beam with the trajectory of the target.
In certain circumstances, it might be possible to attach
a sound source to the victim device or exploit a sound
source in close proximity to the device. Additionally, it
might be possible to carry the sound source with a vehi-
cle or drone that follows the target.
Ideally, an automatic tracking and aiming system
might be implemented to aim the target.
It might use
cameras or radar sensors to track the position of a target
and use a programmable 3-way pan/tilt platform to aim.
Timing. In our experimental settings, attackers observe
actuations of a target and manually tune acoustic signals

however, such settings could be slow and ineffective; it
might be difﬁcult for attackers to analyze the observed
movements and modulate signals timely and correctly.
To reduce potential delays caused by hand tuning and
observing, it might be possible to use more customized
devices, tools, and programs. As we have investigated
in Section 7, a program could help attackers to modulate
acoustic signals more timely and accurately. Moreover,
it might also be possible to use systems with cameras or
radar sensors to help attackers observe and analyze the
behavior of a target more automatically.
In addition, the pattern of a closed-loop system could
be more complex than the simple signal mapping model
in Section 6.1. For example, when a user is riding the
self-balancing scooter, user involvements (including un-
intentional involvements) could counter or disrupt attack
effects. Attackers might need a more speciﬁc model to
analyze and predict the movement patterns.
8.4 Generalization
Acoustic attacks on inertial sensors exploit resonance
and inject analog signals with very high frequencies.
To explore the generalizability of the out-of-band sig-
nal injection model and attack methods, we investigate
whether the oscillating digitized signal could be manip-
ulated when analog signals are sent at relatively low fre-
quencies through a more common sensing channel.
We use a vibrating platform to generate mechanical vi-
bration signals and implement Side-Swing and Switch-
ing attacks on the accelerometer of a smartphone, as
shown in Figure 14. We place the Google Pixel smart-
phone on the platform. In Side-Swing attacks, we gen-
erate sinusoidal vibration signals at 19.6 Hz. While the
phone remains on the platform, the collected accelerom-
eter data shows that the phone is launched to the sky and
has accumulated a speed of 73.9 m/s in about 25 sec-
onds. In Switching attacks, we switch the frequency of
the sinusoidal vibration signal between 19.4 Hz and 20.4
Hz. While the phone is still placed on the platform, the
accelerometer data shows that it has accumulated an up-
ward speed of 74.5 m/s in about 25 seconds.
We try to ﬁnd the approximate sample rate of the em-
bedded accelerometer by inducing an aliased DC-like
signal. We increase the vibration frequency with an in-
terval of 0.1 Hz and observe the induced output. The
ﬁrst DC-like signal is induced at F = 19.9 Hz, the sec-
ond at 39.8 Hz, and the third at 59.7 Hz. Based on
(ε0 ≈ 0), we infer that the sample rate
F = nFS + ε0
of the ADC is approximately 19.9 Hz.
Our experimental results show that, when analog sig-
nals are sent at relatively low frequencies, such as fre-
quencies close to FS, the oscillating digitized signal could

default output in Z-axis is 1 g if the device is at rest.
still be manipulated. Moreover, instead of exploiting res-
onance, malicious signals could be injected and manipu-
lated through the sensing channel as well.
As we have discussed, sensors without a correctly
conﬁgured analog LPF could be vulnerable to out-of-
band signal injections. Furthermore, some digital sen-
sors could have a conﬁgurable sample rate and use a pro-
grammable digital LPF for bandwidth control. For exam-
ple, the ADC sample rate of the MPU-6500 gyroscope is
programmable from 8,000 samples per second, down to
3.9 samples per second [29]. In this case, assuming the
cut-off frequency of the analog LPF is 4 kHz, which is
the half of the maximum sample rate, if applications set
FS to 4 kHz or lower, out-of-band signals with relatively
low frequencies (such as frequencies close to FS) would
not be eliminated by the analog LPF and could be ex-
ploited to manipulate the digitized signal.

Since measurements of embedded sensors are often
trusted by control systems to make critical decisions, the
security of analog sensors has become an increasingly
important concern. This section discusses security of in-
ertial sensors and attacks against analog sensors.

ever, output biasing attacks were only implemented on
exposed sensors with an insufﬁciently realistic attack set-
ting; while the output control attack method only works
on sensors with an insecure ampliﬁer and the generaliz-
ability could be limited in two aspects: (1) To trigger sig-
nal clipping in the ampliﬁer, the amplitude of the induced
analog signal needs to exceed the operating range of the
ampliﬁer. (2) The direction of induced outputs is deter-
mined by the asymmetricity of signal clipping that occurs
in the saturated ampliﬁer and cannot be controlled. Dif-
ferent from prior works, this work shows that an oscil-
lating digitized signal, which is often regarded as noises,
could be manipulated to deliver adversarial control, and
demonstrates implicit control over different kinds of real
systems through non-invasive attacks against embedded
inertial sensors.
Eavesdropping through Inertial Sensors. Inertial sen-
sors have become ubiquitous in mobile devices.
It is
known that access to inertial sensors in both iOS and An-
droid devices does not require permissions from the op-
erating system [40, 53]. Therefore, attackers could sur-
reptitiously read inertial sensor data through either a web
script or a malicious application. The inertial sensing
data in smartphones could be used to recover keystroke
information [40, 37, 54]. Furthermore, the works of [53]
and [35] showed that it might be possible to utilize iner-
tial sensors in a smartphone to eavesdrop speech signals
in certain scenarios. Additionally, a user’s keystroke in-
formation could be recovered by exploiting inertial sen-
sors in smart watches [52, 69, 70]. More recent studies
showed that inertial sensors in mobile devices could be
exploited to establish a covert channel due to their sensi-
tivity to vibrations [46, 39]. All these works focused on
utilizing inertial sensing data for eavesdropping or data
exﬁltration purposes. To our knowledge, the automatic
attack we demonstrate is the ﬁrst method that leverages
inertial sensor data to manipulate the sensor output with
a malicious program.
