### 4. Implementation

**Figure 6** shows the prototype of a single full-duplex radio. To implement this, we designed custom analog circuit boards for self-interference cancellation and integrated them with existing software-defined radios (SDRs). We also implemented digital cancellation algorithms in the SDRs. Below, we discuss the different components in detail.

#### Analog Cancellation Board
The analog cancellation board is a 10Ã—10 cm PCB designed and built using Rogers 4350 material. The fixed delay lines are implemented using microstrip traces. The attenuators used are programmable step attenuators (Peregrine PE43703) that can be programmed in steps of 0.25 dB from 0 to 31.5 dB, providing 128 different values.

#### Radio Transceiver and Baseband
Our goal was to design and implement a full-duplex system capable of supporting the latest WiFi protocol, 802.11ac, with at least 80 MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4 GHz range and a 20 dBm average transmit power. Since widely used SDRs like USRPs or WARPs do not support such high performance, we prototyped our design using radio test equipment from Rohde & Schwarz. For the transmitter, we used an SMBV 100A vector signal generator, supplemented by an external power amplifier. For the receiver, we used an RS spectrum analyzer.

To address the practical concern of re-tuning analog cancellation, we implemented an automatic gain control (AGC) via a digital tunable attenuator in front of the low-noise amplifier (LNA). This ensures that if the receiver gets saturated, the baseband can adjust the attenuator to bring the signal within the dynamic range, and then turn off the attenuation once cancellation is tuned.

### 5. Evaluation

In this section, we experimentally demonstrate that our design delivers a complete full-duplex WiFi physical layer (PHY) link. We validate this claim in two stages: first, by showing that our design provides the required 110 dB of self-interference cancellation to reduce interference to the noise floor, and second, by demonstrating a working full-duplex communication WiFi link that achieves close to the theoretical doubling of throughput.

#### Metrics
We use two key metrics throughout this section:
- **Increase in Noise Floor**: This is the residual interference present after self-interference cancellation, calculated relative to the receiver's noise floor of -90 dBm.
- **SNR Loss**: This is the decrease in SNR experienced by the received signal in full-duplex mode due to any residual self-interference left after cancellation. It is computed as the difference between the SNR in half-duplex mode and full-duplex mode.

#### Comparison with State-of-the-Art Systems
We compare our design against two state-of-the-art full-duplex systems:
- **Balun Cancellation**: This design uses a balun transformer to invert a copy of the transmitted signal, adjust its delay and attenuation, and cancel it. It also uses two antennas separated by 20 cm, providing 30 dB of self-interference reduction.
- **Rice Design**: This design uses an extra transmit chain to generate a cancellation signal combined with the receive chain. It also uses two antennas, and we tested it with both 20 cm and 40 cm separations.

Note that our design uses a single antenna and does not benefit from the 30 dB of self-interference reduction provided by physically separate antennas.

### 5.1 Can We Cancel All Self-Interference?

The first claim we made is that our design can cancel all self-interference for the latest operational WiFi protocols. To test this, we experimentally evaluated the cancellation of an 80 MHz WiFi 802.11ac signal up to a maximum transmit power of 20 dBm. We conducted experiments in different locations and increased the transmit power from 4 dBm to 20 dBm. For each power level and location, we performed 20 runs and computed the average cancellation.

**Figure 7** shows that our design cancels self-interference almost to the noise floor. At 20 dBm transmit power, the noise floor is increased by at most 1 dB over the receiver's noise floor. The amount of cancellation increases with increasing TX power, reaching the required 110 dB for 20 dBm TX power.

#### Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR)
In practice, WiFi transmissions exhibit transient PAPR as high as 10 dB, resulting in peak transmit powers around 30 dBm. Our cancellation system scales up to handle these temporary peaks, bringing them down to the noise floor.

#### Performance with Commodity Radios
To show that our design works with cheap commodity radios, we repeated the experiment using WARP radios. Despite their limitations, our design achieved 110 dB of self-interference cancellation, even with a worse noise floor of -85 dBm compared to -90 dBm of the RS equipment. **Figure 8** shows the spectrum response for our cancellation with both RS and WARP radios.

### 5.1.2 SNR Loss in Full-Duplex Mode

We evaluated the SNR loss for the received signal in full-duplex mode. Two nodes capable of full-duplex operation were set up, and they sent 20 WiFi packets to each other in both half-duplex and full-duplex modes. The SNR loss was defined as the absolute difference between the average SNR in half-duplex and full-duplex modes. **Figure 9** shows that the SNR loss is uncorrelated with the half-duplex SNR value and is typically around or less than 1 dB, indicating that the received signal retains almost the same throughput in full-duplex mode.

### 5.2 Digging Deeper

#### Impact of Constellation and Bandwidth
We conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of constellation and bandwidth on SNR loss. First, we fixed the bandwidth to 80 MHz and varied the constellation from QPSK to 256-QAM. Second, we fixed the constellation to 64-QAM and varied the bandwidth from 20 MHz to 80 MHz. **Figure 10** shows that our design performs consistently well for all constellations and bandwidths.

#### Deconstructing Analog Cancellation
We examined the impact of the number of fixed delay lines in our analog cancellation circuit board. We tested configurations with 8 and 16 lines. **Figure 11** shows that with 8 lines, we achieve 45 dB of cancellation over 80 MHz, while with 16 lines, we achieve 63 dB of cancellation. The higher capability of 16 lines in canceling signal reflections contributes to this improvement.

### Conclusion
Our design demonstrates robust self-interference cancellation, achieving the required 110 dB of cancellation and maintaining low SNR loss across various constellations and bandwidths. This validates our claim of delivering a complete full-duplex WiFi PHY link.
