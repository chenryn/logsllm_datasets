Question: "In the context of Android's cryptographic key lifecycle management, which of the following practices should you follow to adhere to the best practices outlined for handling cryptographic keys?"
 "A": "Store cryptographic keys in plain text within the application's private storage to ensure quick access when performing cryptographic operations."
 "B": "Implement key rotation frequently to replace old keys with new ones, thus minimizing the risk of a key being compromised over time."
 "C": "Use the same cryptographic key for multiple purposes across the application to reduce complexity and streamline key management."
 "D": "Archive cryptographic keys indefinitely to maintain historical data encryption compatibility, regardless of whether the keys are still in use."
Answer: B
