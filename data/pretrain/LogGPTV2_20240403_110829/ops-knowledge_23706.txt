User: I am trying to call a python [module] method to find the version of a newly installed driver on a Windows computer. Tried with WMI_SystemDriver but it does not provide the version, only other fields not needed by me at this time.Is there a way to see something like:
Question also posted on a Google group - not answered
version x.y.z.t
Thank you
Assistant: This is going to sound different but I know the powershell command will get you the driver version. 
strCommand = r"powershell.exe ""Get-WmiObject Win32_PnPSignedDriver | select devicename, driverversion | ConvertTo-CSV"""
Then you can parse each line in your output.  Each line is csv delimited so you have the Driver Name, and the Driver Version.  I wrote a quick demo but since I am still a bit new here my code did not look right.  But that is my suggestion.
