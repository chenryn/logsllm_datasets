pose for instance that http://www.example.com/
blog is infected and redirects to http://1337.
attacker.test which in turns redirects to http:
//www32.cheaprx4u.test. We then create three
nodes v1 = example.com, v2 = attacker.test
and v3 = cheaprx4u.test, and two edges, v1 → v2
and v2 → v3. Now, if http://hax0r.attacker.
test is also present in the database, and redirects
to http://www.otherrx.test, we create a node
v4 = otherrx.test and establish an edge v2 → v4.
In the graph G so built, online pharmacies are usually
leaf nodes with a positive in-degree and out-degree zero.4
Compromised websites feeding trafﬁc to pharmacies are
generally represented as sources, with an in-degree of
zero and a positive out-degree. Trafﬁc redirectors, which
act as intermediaries between compromised websites and
online pharmacies have positive in- and out-degrees.
The resulting graph G for our entire database con-
sists of 34 connected subgraphs containing more than
two nodes. The largest connected component G0 con-
tains 96% of all infected domains, 90% of the redirection
domains and 92% of the pharmacy domains collected
throughout the six-month collection period.
In other words, we have evidence that most online
pharmacies are connected by redirection chains. While
this does not necessarily indicate that a single criminal
organization is behind the entire online pharmacy net-
work, this does tell us that most illicit online pharmacies
in our measurements are obtaining trafﬁc from a large
interconnected network of advertising afﬁliates. Under-
cover investigations have conﬁrmed the existence of such
afﬁliate networks and provided anecdotal evidence on
4Manually checking the data, we ﬁnd a few pharmacies have an
out-degree of 1, and redirect to other pharmacies.

apparent from inspecting the diagrams. First, source in-
fections are not widely reported by any of the blacklists
(95% do not appear on a single blacklist), but around half
of the redirects are found on at least one blacklist and
over two thirds of pharmacy websites show up on at least
one blacklist. Surprisingly, 12% of redirects appear on
the email spam blacklist, as well as 24% of pharmacies.
We speculate that this could be caused by afﬁliates adver-
tising pharmacy domains in email spam, but it could also
be that the pharmacies directly send email spam adver-
tisements or use botnets for both hosting and spamming.
The level of coverage of Google and SiteAdvisor are
comparable, which is somewhat surprising given SiteAd-
visor’s relatively broader remit to ﬂag scams, not only
malware. Google’s more comprehensive coverage of
pharmacy websites in particular suggests that some phar-
macies may also engage in distributing malware. We
conclude by noting that the majority of websites affected
by the trafﬁc redirection scam are not identiﬁed by any of
these blacklists. This in turn suggests that relatively lit-
tle pressure is currently being applied to the miscreants
carrying out the attacks.
5 Towards a conversion rate estimate
While it is difﬁcult to measure precisely as an outsider,
we nonetheless would like to provide a ballpark ﬁgure
for how lucrative web search is to the illicit online pre-
scription drug trade. Here we measure two aspects of the
demand side: search-query popularity and sales trafﬁc.
10
For the ﬁrst category, we once again turn to the Google
Trafﬁc Estimator to better understand how many peo-
ple use online pharmacies advertised though search-
redirection attacks. Table 3 lists the results for each of
the three search query corpora described in Section 2.2
and Appendix A. The main and extra queries attract the
most visitors, with a median of 1 600 monthly searches
for the main sample and 1 300 for the extra queries. Sev-
eral highly popular terms appeared in the results: “vi-
agra” and “pharmacy” each attract 6 million monthly
searches, while “cialis” and “phentermine” appear in
around 3 million each. By contrast, only 6% of the search
queries in the FDA sample registered with the Google
tool. The FDA query list includes around 6 500 terms,
which dwarfs the size of the other lists. Since over 90%
of the FDA queries are estimated to have no monthly
searches, the overal median popularity is also zero.
While these search terms do not cover all possible
queries, taken together they do represent a useful lower
bound on the global monthly searches for drugs. To
translate the aggregate search count into visits to phar-
macies facilitated by search-redirection attacks, we as-
sume that the share of visits websites receive is pro-
portional to the number of URIs that turn up in the
search results. Given that 38% of the search results we
found pointed to infected websites, we might expect that
the monthly share of visits to these sites facilitated by
Google searches to be around 13 million. Google re-
portedly has a 64.4% market share in search [13]. Con-
sequently we expect that the trafﬁc arriving from other
0.644 ∗ 13 million = 7 million.
search engines to be 1−0.644
We manually visited 150 pharmacy websites identiﬁed
in our study and added drugs to shopping carts to observe
the beginning of the payment process. We found that 94
of these websites in fact pointed to one of 21 different
payment processing websites. These websites typically
had valid SSL certiﬁcates signed by trusted authorities,
which helps explain why multiple pharmacy storefronts
may want to share the same payment processing website.
The fact that these websites are only used for payment
processing means that if we could measure the trafﬁc to
these websites, then we could roughly approximate how
many people actually purchase drugs from these pharma-
cies. Fortunately for us, these websites receive enough
trafﬁc to be monitored by services such as Alexa. We
tallied Alexa’s estimated daily visits for each of these
websites; in total, they receive 855 000 monthly visits.
We next checked whether these payment websites also
offered payment processing other than just for pharmacy
websites. To check this, we fetched 1 000 backlinks for
each of the sites from Yahoo Site Explorer [6]. Col-
lectively, 1 561 domains linked in to the payment web-
sites. From URI naming and manual inspection, we de-
termined that at least 1 181 of the backlink domains, or
75%, are online pharmacies. This suggests that the pri-
mary purpose of these websites is to process payments
for online pharmacies.
Taken together, we can use all the information dis-
cussed above to provide a lower bound on the sales con-
version rate of pharmacy web search trafﬁc:
