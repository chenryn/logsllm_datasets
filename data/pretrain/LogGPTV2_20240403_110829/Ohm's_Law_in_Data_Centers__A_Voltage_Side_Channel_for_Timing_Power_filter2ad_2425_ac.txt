current IN compared to I =˝N
where, for better presentation, we replace the approximation with
equality given the fact that the voltage drop IN · RN between the
PDU and attacker’s server is negligible due to the much smaller
n=1 In and small line resistance RN .
Even when IN · RN is non-negligible, the attacker can lower its
server’s power (i.e., decrease IN ) to make IN · RN sufficiently small.
4.2 ∆V -based attack
We now present an intuitive strategy — ∆V -based attack — that
times power attacks directly based on the attacker’s voltage mea-
surement VN . Importantly, we will show that this seemingly effec-
tive strategy results in a rather poor timing of power attacks.
The tenants’ aggregate power usage is proportional to the total
n=1 and hence also to the voltage drop ∆V = |I ·
R| = |VU PS − VN | between the UPS and PDU, where | · | denotes
the absolute value operation and the resistance R is a constant
(unknown to the attacker) due to the well-conditioned data center
temperature [23].
current I =˝N
One may think that VU PS is equal to the nominal voltage VN ominal
(e.g., 120V in North America) since it is the UPS output [38]. Conse-
quently, the attacker can simply check its own voltage measurement
VN to time power attacks: a low VN means a high voltage drop ∆V
between the UPS and the PDU, which indicates a high aggregate
power usage and hence a good opportunity for power attacks. We
refer to this timing strategy as ∆V -based attack.
Nonetheless, the voltage VU PS output by the UPS can vary con-
siderably over time, e.g., up and down by as much as 5V (Fig. 3(a)).
The reason is that even state-of-the-art UPS can only regulate its
output voltage within 3% of its nominal voltage [38]. The large
temporal variation in VU PS is also driven by external factors, such
as the grid generator and other loads sharing the same grid. More
importantly, the attacker cannot measure VU PS to calculate ∆V =
|I · R| = |VU PS − VN | because it cannot place its ADC circuit at the
output of the UPS which is owned by the data center operator. On
the other hand, compared to the VU PS variation, the variation in
voltage drop ∆V = |I · R| caused by tenants’ power usage is much
smaller (in the order of a few millivolts) because of the small line
resistance.
In Fig. 3(a), we show a 12-hour trace of the voltage output by our
CyberPower UPS and PDU voltage supplied to servers. The voltage
drop between the UPS an PDU is negligible compared to the UPS

voltage variation itself. In Fig. 3(b), we show the cumulative distri-
bution function of the UPS output voltage at different timescales,
demonstrating that the UPS output voltage can vary much more
significantly than the line voltage drop due to server load.
To conclude, the change of VN is predominantly driven by the
variation in the UPS voltage VU PS , rather than the actual line volt-
age drop ∆V = |I · R| caused by the tenants’ power usage. Thus,
without knowing time-varying VU PS , the ∆V -based strategy cannot
precisely time power attacks (Fig. 16 in Section 5.2).
4.3 Exploiting High-Frequency Voltage Ripples
Given the ineffectiveness of the ∆V -based attack, we present our
key idea: the PFC circuit inside each server’s power supply unit
generates high-frequency voltage ripples that have a strong correla-
tion with the servers’ power, which can reveal the aggregate power
usage information at runtime. Next, we will first show the root
cause of why the PFC generates high-frequency voltage ripples,
and then validate the ripples through experiments.
4.3.1 Overview of server’s power supply unit. We first provide an
overview of server’s power supply unit to facilitate the readers’
understanding. All the internal components of a server/computer,
such as CPU, run on DC power at a regulated voltage (usually 12V),
provided by an internal power supply unit. Fig. 4 shows a block
diagram of a server.
In the first step, the sinusoidal AC voltage supplied by the PDU is
passed through an AC to DC full-bridge rectifier which inverts the
negative part of the sine wave and outputs a pulsating DC (half-sine
waves). Then, a power factor correction (PFC) circuit outputs an
elevated voltage at 380V which is then fed to a DC to DC converter
to lower it to 12V supplied to server’s internal components. An
important concept is power factor, which is a scalar value between
0 and 1 measuring the fraction of total delivered power that is
actually used. The power factor goes down when the voltage or
current becomes non-sinusoidal, which creates power waste and
other detrimental effects [24]. In Appendix A, we show the impli-
cations of not using a PFC circuit. Thus, to improve server’s power
factor, a PFC circuit is required and also mandated by international
regulations [39, 40].
4.3.2 Voltage ripples generated by PFC circuit. The purpose of the
PFC circuit is to improve power factor by shaping the current
drawn by the power supply unit to match the sinusoidal source

levels. (b) Current ripples from the PFC switching.
voltage.2 The working principle is to draw more current when the
input voltage (pulsating AC at the rectifier output) is high and
draw less current when the input voltage is low. Fig. 5 shows the
basic block diagram of the most commonly-used boost-type PFC
with an inductor, a diode, a switch (MOSFET), and the pulse width
modulation (PWM) control circuit [24, 41, 42]. The PWM control
circuit repeatedly closes and opens the switch at a high frequency
to control the current through the inductor to shape it like a sine
wave while also maintaining a stable DC voltage at the output. The
current wave shapes of the inductor controlled by a server’s PFC
circuit are illustrated in Fig. 6(a).
A prominent side effect of the PWM circuit’s rapid switching is
the rapid change in the current (i.e., high-frequency ripple) drawn
from the source. Hence, the PFC circuit in the power supply unit
creates high-frequency current ripples flowing through the power
line between the UPS and PDU, which in turn result in voltage
ripples along the line due to the Ohm’s Law.
Importantly, a key observation is that the voltage ripples are at
a much higher frequency (40 ∼ 100kHz) than the 50/60Hz nominal
grid frequency as well as the UPS output voltage frequency. Thus,
the voltage ripple signal and UPS output voltage VU PS signal are
orthogonal in the frequency domain. In fact, this is also the fun-
damental principle for power line communications that leverage
power networks as the transmission medium (e.g., recent studies
[43] have proposed to install special transmitters and leverage data
center power lines to send control command signals for server
network management).
In summary, while the PFC circuit is mandated for improving the
power factor [39], its usage of PWM-based switching design creates
high-frequency ripple voltage signal that is transmitted over the data
center power lines without interference from the UPS output voltage.
2The voltage signal coming from the PDU is not perfectly sinusoidal; instead, it has
voltage ripples due to current ripples along the UPS-PDU line (Fig. 7).

Impact of server’s power usage on voltage ripples. A natural
4.3.3
follow-up question is: do the voltage ripples carry information about
server’s power usage?
Note first that if we apply a band-pass filter to keep frequency
components within a certain range around the PFC switching fre-
quency (e.g., ∼70kHz), the UPS output voltage VU PS signal becomes
approximately zero and the voltage relation in Eqn. (1) reduces to
where ˜x represents a filtered version of x that only keeps frequency
components around the PFC switching frequency. Thus, the at-
tacker’s filtered voltage measurement ˜VN essentially only contains
the voltage ripple signal. It is possible that the UPS output voltage
VU PS itself also has some high-frequency components (due to, e.g.,
grid input), but these frequency components are rather weak be-
cause of fading over a long distance and hence can be viewed as
background noise (Fig. 8(a)).
There are three basic conduction modes for PFC designs: con-
tinuous, discontinuous and critical conduction modes [24]. In both
discontinuous and critical conduction modes, the current ripple
decreases to zero during each switching cycle and the hence peak
current can be exceedingly high (twice as much as the average
current). Thus, they are mostly designed for low-power devices. In
today’s servers, power supply units are most commonly designed
with a fixed-frequency PFC operating under the continuous con-
duction mode where the current ripple does not decrease to zero
during each PWM-controlled switching cycle (as shown in Fig. 6(a)).
We take a closer look at the PFC current ramps in Fig. 6(b). The
current goes up when the switch is “ON” (i.e., the MOSFET is turned
on), and goes down when the switch is “OFF”. The “ON” and “OFF”
times are designated as Ton and Tof f in Fig. 6(b), where the period
is T = Ton + Tof f and the duty cycle is D = Ton
. The duty cycle
T
is regulated within each cycle to ensure that the average current
follows the reference current shown in dashed line in Fig. 6(b). The
reference current is set based on the sampled input voltage to make
the resulting current follow the voltage shape (i.e., improve the
power factor to close to 1).
To accommodate the server power change, the current changes
and there is a multiplier applied to the current reference sampled
from the input voltage. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 6(a), we
have a taller current wave when the power is higher and vice versa.
Intuitively, the current waves we show in Fig. 6(b) need to rise faster
when the server consumes more power, as the current ramp needs
to reach higher values. It also needs to drop faster from a higher
current to follow the sinusoidal voltage wave. On the other hand, the

vs. PSD aggregated within the bandwidth of 69.5 ∼ 70.5kHz
for the 495W power supply unit.
PFC switching frequency is relatively fixed (with a small temporal
variation shown in Fig. 25 in Appendix F). Therefore, when a server
consumes more power, the current ripple needs to change faster
(i.e., increasing/decreasing faster) within one switching period, and
vice versa. Correspondingly, based on the Ohm’s Law in Eqn. (2),
we expect to see a more prominent high-frequency voltage ripple.
To quantify the intensity of the voltage ripple, we use aggregate
power spectral density (PSD), i.e., the sum of PSD components over
a 1kHz band centered around the PFC switching frequency. We
choose 1kHz as our default frequency band, and we will later vary
the frequency band (Fig. 12(d)).
In summary, the high-frequency voltage ripple created by a server
is expected to be more significant when it consumes more power.
4.4 Experimental validation
We now seek experimental validation on real servers to corroborate
our discussion in Section 4.3.3. Here, we only present the results,
while the experimental setup is described in Section 5.1.
Single server. We first run only one server with a 495W-rating
power supply unit. Fig. 7 shows two zoom-in oscilloscope screen-
shots that reveal the voltage ripples caused by the server’s power
supply unit. We further run frequency analysis on the collected
voltage signals over each one-second segment. We show the result-
ing power spectral density (PSD) with and without the server, in
Figs. 8(a) and 8(b), respectively. We see that the server produces a
PSD spike around 70kHz, presenting a concrete proof of the voltage
ripples observable in the power line network.
We then run the server at different power levels and show the
PSD around the server’s PFC switching frequency in Fig. 9(a). We
see that the PSD is higher when the server power consumption is
higher, matching with our expectation. We next show the server
power vs. aggregate PSD in Fig. 9(b), by summing up all the fre-
quency components within a 1kHz band (69.8 ∼ 70.8kHz). In Sec-
tion 4.5, we provide an algorithm to identify the frequency band
over which the PSD is aggregated. We see that the aggregate PSD

monotonically increases with the server power. We also conduct
similar experiments with a 350W power supply unit and show the
results in Appendix B. We note that given a certain server power, the
resulting aggregate PSD varies little, because of the high-frequency
ripple signal transmission over power lines without much interfer-
ence. Finally, we also identify that the switching frequency remains
relatively fixed as shown in Fig. 25 in Appendix F.
