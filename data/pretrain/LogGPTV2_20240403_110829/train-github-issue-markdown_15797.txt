`PI:EMAIL` utilizes `babel.config.js` for its global configuration. For more information, please refer to [babel/babel#7358](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7358).

On the other hand, `next@6.0.0` employs `.babelrc` for its Babel configuration. When using an external Babel configuration, the following message is displayed:
```
> Using external babel configuration
> Location: "/app/.babelrc"
```

I assume this discrepancy is due to `next@6.0.0` still relying on `PI:EMAIL` rather than the latest version.

- I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
