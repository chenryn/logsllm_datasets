### On-Demand and Live Audio/Video Distributions

**Figure 1: On-demand and live audio distributions in the home and business user workloads**

- **(a) On-demand audio file length**
  - The x-axis represents the file length in seconds, ranging from 0 to 100,000.
  - The y-axis represents the playback duration in seconds, ranging from 0.01 to 10,000.
  - For business users, more than 70% of sessions request files with a length between 200-400 seconds, typical for a pop song.
  - For home users, more than 50% of sessions request files around 30 seconds, often music preview samples.

- **(b) On-demand audio playback duration**
  - The x-axis represents the playback duration in seconds, ranging from 0.01 to 10,000.
  - The y-axis represents the frequency of sessions.
  - More than half of on-demand audio sessions in the business user workload have a playback duration of about 200-400 seconds, corresponding to the length of a typical pop song.

- **(c) Live audio playback duration**
  - The x-axis represents the playback duration in seconds, ranging from 0.01 to 10,000.
  - The y-axis represents the frequency of sessions.
  - Both live and on-demand audio sessions show that business users have longer playback durations compared to home users.

**Figure 2: On-demand and live video distributions in the home and business user workloads**

- **(a) On-demand video file length**
  - The x-axis represents the file length in seconds, ranging from 0 to 100,000.
  - The y-axis represents the playback duration in seconds, ranging from 0.01 to 10,000.
  - Similar to audio, business users tend to request longer video files.

- **(b) On-demand video playback duration**
  - The x-axis represents the playback duration in seconds, ranging from 0.01 to 10,000.
  - The y-axis represents the frequency of sessions.
  - Business users have longer playback durations for on-demand videos.

- **(c) Live video playback duration**
  - The x-axis represents the playback duration in seconds, ranging from 0.01 to 10,000.
  - The y-axis represents the frequency of sessions.
  - Business users also have longer playback durations for live videos.

### Analysis of User Behavior

Business users tend to listen to more audio and watch more video content, with longer playback durations compared to home users. However, the URLs and Referer headers of RTSP commands indicate that both groups primarily access news and entertainment sites. The difference in behavior is likely due to the working environment of business users, where audio is preferred as it attracts less attention during work, and long playback durations may be due to fewer interruptions.

### Traffic by Different Hosting Services

**Table 3: Traffic by different hosting services**

| Hosting Service | Business User (GB) | Home User (GB) | Business User (Requests) | Home User (Requests) |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Third Party     | 13.82              | 126.24         | 27,896                   | 54,136               |
| Self            | 11.41              | 95.33          | 12,188                   | 26,939               |

- **Third-party hosting**: CDNs and MDNs serve 56.8% of traffic and 67.7% of requests in the home user workload, and 50.3% of traffic and 72.6% of requests in the business user workload.
- **Self-hosting**: A substantial amount of video traffic in the business user workload comes from news and sports sites outside the United States, possibly due to foreign employees.

### Protocol Rollover and User Startup Latency

**Protocol Rollover in Streaming Media**

- **Procedure**: UDP is tried first, followed by TCP, and then HTTP if necessary.
- **Impact on Startup Latency**: Protocol rollover can significantly increase startup latency, especially in environments with NAT routers/firewalls.

**Figure 4: Protocol rollover increases startup latency of streaming sessions**

- **(a) Windows media services**: More than 22% of sessions have a rollover time longer than 5 seconds.
- **(b) RealNetworks media services**: More than 67% of sessions have a rollover time longer than 5 seconds.
- **(c) Comparison of sessions with and without rollover in Windows media services**: Sessions with protocol rollover have a higher delay, with about 37% having a delay longer than 5 seconds, compared to 13% for sessions without rollover.

### Protocol Selection and Rollover Avoidance

- **Default Protocol**: UDP is the default, but most traffic is delivered over TCP.
- **Rollover Occurrence**: Only 7.37% of sessions in the home user workload and 7.95% in the business user workload experience protocol rollover.
- **Reasons for Direct TCP Use**: Despite the default setting, many sessions directly use TCP, possibly due to URL modifiers or server-side configurations.

This analysis provides insights into the differences in streaming media consumption patterns between home and business users, as well as the impact of protocol rollover on user experience.
