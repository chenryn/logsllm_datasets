## Abstract

This paper introduces Droplet, a decentralized data access control service that enables data owners to securely and selectively share their encrypted data while ensuring data confidentiality, even in the presence of unauthorized parties and compromised data servers. Droplet's key contributions are:
1. A cryptographically-enforced access control mechanism for encrypted data streams, allowing users to define fine-grained, stream-specific access policies.
2. A decentralized authorization service that enforces user-defined access policies.

We present Droplet's design, a reference implementation, and experimental results from three case-study applications: Fitbit activity tracker, Ava health tracker, and ECOviz smart meter dashboard. These applications demonstrate Droplet's effectiveness in securely sharing IoT data streams.

## 1. Introduction

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to an increasing number of applications that collect sensitive user data. This growth has raised significant concerns about data privacy. Currently, application providers, such as Fitbit and Strava, collect and manage user data, which is stored in isolated silos. This centralized model limits users' ability to control, extract value from, and transfer their data across different applications. Consequently, there is a growing demand for a user-centric model where data storage is decoupled from application logic, and users have control over their data.

To achieve this paradigm, system designs must prioritize data privacy while enabling users to securely, selectively, and flexibly grant data access to third-party services. Such access control should provide:
1. Strong data confidentiality and integrity with efficient cryptographic operations, especially for resource-constrained IoT devices.
2. Fine-grained access control, allowing users to specify who can access specific temporal segments of a data stream.
3. No reliance on trusted intermediaries, which are often trust bottlenecks.

Existing solutions do not simultaneously meet all these requirements. Standard deployments rely on trusted services like access control lists, Active Directory, and OAuth, which assume that the entity enforcing access control is within the data owner's trusted domain. This approach fails to provide basic data privacy, as the provider can see and potentially misuse the data.

An alternative is end-to-end encryption, where data is encrypted at the user device and stored encrypted at the storage provider. However, this approach faces challenges in supporting flexible access control policies. Current solutions for sharing encrypted data, such as encrypting data under each consumer's public key, suffer from hard-coded policies and scalability issues, particularly for high-volume and high-velocity data streams.

### Key Question and Focus

The main question addressed in this paper is how to realize decentralized access control in a user-centric architecture. The solution involves two components:
1. Data protection (e.g., encrypting data so that only authorized principals can access it).
2. Authorization (e.g., verifying the identity of a principal and the authenticity of access permissions).

## 2. System Design and Architecture

Droplet addresses the above challenges through a new system architecture and a crypto-based data access construction. The key insights driving Droplet's design are:
1. Access control and authorization must be co-designed for end-to-end encrypted systems.
2. Time is the natural dimension for accessing data streams.
3. There is a need for decentralized authorization services that do not rely on trusted intermediaries.

Droplet leverages replicated state machines, such as blockchains, to provide guarantees about the existence and status of a shared state without a single trusted intermediary. While blockchains offer an alternative trust model, they come with overhead and bandwidth limitations due to their consensus protocols. To mitigate these issues, Droplet minimizes blockchain operations by storing minimal control metadata on the blockchain and outsourcing data streams and metadata to off-chain storage. This design allows for lightweight clients that only retrieve block headers and compact Merkle proofs, reducing latency and bandwidth requirements.

### Crypto-Based Access Control

In Droplet, devices encrypt and sign their data locally. Data owners register ownership of data streams and define privacy-preserving access permissions through the authorization service. Only authorized principals can decrypt and access the specified data segments. We introduce a novel key distribution and management construction that supports efficient key updates and fine-grained, scalable sharing of both arbitrary temporal ranges and open-ended streams. Our design uses key regression and hash trees via a layered encryption technique.

### Prototype Implementation and Evaluation

We implemented a prototype of Droplet and evaluated its performance. When deployed with Amazon S3 as the storage layer, Droplet experienced only a 3% slowdown in request throughput compared to vanilla S3. We also demonstrated Droplet's potential as an authorization service for serverless paradigms using AWS Lambda. Droplet's performance is comparable to the industry-standard OAuth2 protocol. Additionally, we deployed Droplet with a decentralized storage layer to showcase its potential for emerging decentralized storage services. Real-world applications, such as our example apps, can be developed with unaltered user experience.

### Contributions

- **Droplet**: A new decentralized authorization service that enables secure sharing of encrypted data without trusted intermediaries.
- **Crypto-Enforced Access Control**: A new construction providing flexible and fine-grained access control over encrypted data streams with succinct key states.
- **Coupled Authorization and Access Control**: A design that integrates authorization with crypto-enforced access to address the limitations of current authorization services and end-to-end encrypted data.
- **Open-Source Prototype and Evaluation**: Demonstrating Droplet's feasibility and competitive performance.

## 3. Overview of Droplet

Droplet's primary goal is to empower users with full control and ownership over their data while ensuring data confidentiality. Specifically, Droplet facilitates flexible and fine-grained secure sharing of encrypted data without exposing the data in the clear to any intermediaries, including storage and authorization services. Data ownership is defined as having the right and control over data, allowing the owner to define or restrict access, delegate privileges, or give up ownership entirely without relying on trusted entities.

### Droplet in a Nutshell

Droplet is a decentralized access control system that enables users to securely and selectively share their data streams with principals. It combines a novel crypto-enforced access control construction tailored for time-series data and a decentralized authorization service. The crypto-enforced access control allows users to express flexible stream access control policies. Data is serialized into chunks, each corresponding to a time segment and encrypted with a unique key. We introduce a key management construction with a succinct key state, ensuring the key size does not grow with the temporal range of shared data.

### Security Model

#### Threat Model

1. **Data Storage**: We consider adversaries interested in learning about users' data, including malicious storage nodes, security vulnerabilities, and external adversaries who gain access to data through system compromise.
2. **Access Permissions State**: An adversary may access and bootstrap the access control state machine but cannot alter or learn sensitive information about access permissions. Altering access permission states requires breaking the underlying blockchain's security. The standard blockchain threat model assumes that an adversary cannot control a large percentage of nodes in the network. For example, a ratio of \( n = 2f + 1 \) for Nakamoto-style consensus or \( n = 3f + 1 \) for PBFT consensus is required for the honest majority.

#### Guarantees

Droplet provides a decentralized encryption-based access control mechanism that ensures secure and selective access to stream data within the discussed threat model. Data is encrypted at the client-side, and keys are managed securely.
