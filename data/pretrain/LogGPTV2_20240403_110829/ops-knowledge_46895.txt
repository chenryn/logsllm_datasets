I have a Python framework that needs to execute Bash scripts as plugins. We are using the `multiprocessing` module to create worker processes, which retrieve plugin details from a `multiprocessing.JoinableQueue` and execute the plugins using `subprocess.Popen()`.

We have observed that the final output generated by the shell scripts is often truncated, leading to incomplete or failed executions. To address this, we switched to using Python threads for the workers, while still employing `subprocess.Popen()` to spawn the shell script processes. This change resolved the truncation issue, but the performance was significantly slower due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Additionally, the response to signals and events became unpredictable, likely due to GIL release timings.

Research and discussions on platforms like Stack Overflow suggest that the `multiprocessing` module buffers `stdout`. While we understand this is the root cause, we have not found a suitable solution. We cannot use `sys.stdout.flush` in Python to flush the data that the shell script writes to a file, and attempts with `os.fsync` were also unsuccessful because the names of the files created by the shell scripts are unknown to the framework. The framework only collects the final archive.

### Question
Is there a way to prevent this buffering in the processes spawned by the `multiprocessing` module? Would using the `-u` option of the Python interpreter help? Alternatively, are there any modifications to the `multiprocessing` library in `/usr/lib64/python2.6/multiprocessing` that could resolve this issue?

### Solution
Upon further investigation, we discovered that the commands sent over SSH within the scripts were the ones experiencing output truncation. We resolved this by using the `-n` flag with SSH, which prevents reading from `stdin`. This change eliminated the truncation issue.

However, this problem is specific to the Python `multiprocessing` environment and should be considered carefully by anyone planning to use a similar model.

### Explanation of the `-n` Flag
The `-n` flag in SSH redirects `stdin` from `/dev/null`, effectively preventing the SSH process from reading from `stdin`. This is particularly useful when running SSH in the background. For example, `ssh -n user@host command &` will start the specified command on the remote host and put the SSH process in the background. This approach is commonly used to run X11 programs remotely, where the X11 connection is automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel.

Note that the `-n` flag does not work if SSH needs to prompt for a password or passphrase. In such cases, the `-f` option can be used instead.

This solution has been effective, but it highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between Python's `multiprocessing` module and external processes, especially those involving SSH.
