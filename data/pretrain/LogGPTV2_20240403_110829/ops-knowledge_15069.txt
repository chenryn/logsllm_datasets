User: I am working on a python/tornado web application.
I have several options to save in my app.
Thoses options can by changed by the user, and those options will be access very often.
I have created an sqlite database but there is some disk operation and i am asking you what is the best location for those options.
Does tornado embed a feature for custom user options ?
Thanks
Assistant: Yes, there is the tornado.options package, which does pretty much what you need. Keep in mind, however, that the values saved here are not persisted between requests; if you need that kind of functionality, you will have to implement an external persistence solution, which you already have done with SQLite.
