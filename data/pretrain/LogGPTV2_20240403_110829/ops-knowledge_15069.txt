I am developing a Python/Tornado web application that requires several user-configurable options. These options can be modified by the user and will be accessed frequently. 

Initially, I created an SQLite database to store these options, but I am concerned about the performance impact of frequent disk operations. I am seeking advice on the best location or method for storing these frequently accessed, user-modifiable options.

Does Tornado provide any built-in features for managing custom user options?

**Response:**

Tornado does include a package called `tornado.options` which can be used to manage configuration settings. However, it is important to note that the values stored using `tornado.options` are not persistent between requests. If you need to persist these options across multiple requests, you will still need an external persistence solution, such as the SQLite database you have already implemented.

For optimal performance, you might consider using an in-memory cache (e.g., Redis) to store the frequently accessed options, while periodically syncing with the SQLite database to ensure data persistence. This approach can significantly reduce the number of disk operations and improve the overall performance of your application.
