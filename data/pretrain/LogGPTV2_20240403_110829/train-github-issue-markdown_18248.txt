I think it would be helpful UX wise to see an incremental hot-reload build
version bottom right of the app when you are hot-reloading.
Many times you are hot-reloading non-ui stuff and looking at your device and
you dont quite sure if the app hot-reloaded and have to look back at the IDE
to see if the hot-reload message is updated in the console
