reach the gateway in the ﬁrst cycle. Considering this best
case, when the uplink message is transmitted successfully on
all links, it reaches the gateway after 70ms with probability
0.4219. After processing in the PID controller, the output mes-
sage follows a similar downlink path, assuming a symmetric
setup. In that case, the control-loop could be completed in one
cycle with probability 0.42192 = 0.178.
The computed utilization rate of this path Up = 0.14 is very
low because the considered path only occupies 3 slots in the
7-slot schedule.
In the following we investigate the inﬂuence of two factors,
namely the link availability and the path hop number on the
quality of service measures of a given path.
B. Link availability
Consider a path that consists of n individual links, where
some of the links are shared with other paths in the network.
We ﬁrst discuss the case where all links are homogeneous,
i.e., share the same transition probabilities and in steady-state.
The case with heterogeneous links will be investigated later
on.
We choose prc = 0.9, which could be easily adjusted
according to real practice. As a result, the link availability is
determined by only one variable: the link failure probability
pf l. Recall that the correlation between pf l and the bit error
rate is expressed in Equation (2).
i.e. L = 127 ∗ 8 = 1016. In this manner,
According to the WirelessHART standard speciﬁcation [15],
a typical WirelessHART MAC layer payload length is 127
bytes,
the
link availability can be determined by the bit error rate in
WirelessHART channels. For instance, if BER = 1 ∗ 10−4,
using the above Equation, we obtain pf l = 0.0966 and the
stationary link availability π(up) = 0.9031. Hence, the lower
the bit error rate, the lower the failure probability, which leads
to a higher link availability.
We compute the reachability and the delay distribution of
the 3-hop path under different link availabilities. This can hap-
pen when the links work in different channels, with different
bit error rates (BER). Figure 8 shows the reachability R of
this path under different stationary link availabilities π(up),
ranging from 0.69 to 0.95, which increases and converges to
1 with the link availability. From the ﬁgure it becomes clear
that a link availability of at least 0.75 is necessary to achieve
a reachability that is relatively close to 1. For π(up) ≥ 0.9
a reachability of R ≥ 0.998 follows, indicating excellent
performance and timely delivery.
Figure 9 shows the delay distributions τ with different link
availabilities. The possible delays stay the same, but clearly
their probabilities change with the link availability. A higher
link availability leads to a steeper and more concentrated
delay distribution; while a lower link availability results in
a ﬂatter distribution with a longer tail. Speciﬁcally, when
π(up) = 0.948, 98.5% of the messages have a delay that
is shorter than 200ms and those with longer delays can be
neglected. In contrast, when π(up) = 0.774, only 77.8% of
the messages have a delay shorter than 200ms and more than
5.3% of the messages have a delay of 470ms, which may be
unacceptable in some control systems. The expected (mean)
delay E[τ] for different link availabilities, calculated using
Equation 9, is listed in Table I.

Hence, the link availability is signiﬁcant for path perfor-
mance. A high link availability is desirable in order to achieve
a high message reachability and short delays.
C. Hop count
During the initialization of a WirelessHART network, ﬁeld
devices are self-organized. If a node is located far away from
the gateway’s access point, it needs more intermediate hops
to relay. According to the ofﬁcial guideline [9], the maximum
distance from a node to the gateway in WirelessHART should
not exceed 4 hops. This is meant to guarantee that networking
delays do not harm control performance.
Hence, we analyze paths with length varying from one to
four, assuming similar path links with stationary link availabil-
ity π(up) = 0.83. The resulting reachability is shown in Figure
10. Clearly, the one-hop path has the highest reachability of
0.9992. With more hops, the reachability decreases, and for
the four-hop path, it ﬁnally drops to 0.9812. This is because a
larger hop-count results in a higher probability of a transmis-
sion failure along the way. This suggests that it is beneﬁcial
to minimize the path hop number in a WirelessHART network
to ensure the stability of the control loop.
D. Path Compositionality
The hierarchical path model describes end-to-end message
delivery. Normally, one end is the gateway. If both ends are
ﬁeld devices, peer-to-peer communication is performed and
such a path is referred to as peer path in the following.
A new path can be formed by the composition of an existing
path with a peer path if they share one end. An example is
shown in Figure 11. The peer path from node 5 to node 3 is
connected to the existing path from node 3 to the gateway,
thereby forming a new path from node 5 to the gateway.

While it is possible to recompute the DTMC model for
the composed path,
this is not necessary, since the cycle
probabilities of the new path can be derived using the old
models, as follows.
Assume that a message reaches the end of the peer path p
in the m-th cycle. In the same cycle, forwarding is continued
along the existing path e towards the gateway. If it takes n
cycles to reach the gateway, then the message reaches the
destination in m+n−1 cycles. Since the cycles of the existing
path and the peer path are independent of each other, the
composed cycle probability function gc(x) is the convolution
of the cycle probability functions ge(x) and gp(x), however
time-shifted by one.
gc(x) =
ge(i)gp(x − 1 − i).
(12)
i=0
With the cycle probability function, the new path reacha-
bility can be derived using Equation 6. This can be useful in
network routing and in dynamic topologies to chose the route
with the highest reachability.
VI. NETWORK PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
This section ﬁrst evaluates the performance of a typical
WirelessHART network in Section VI-A. After that, we dis-
cuss the inﬂuence of the communication schedule in Section
VI-B. System robustness against different kinds of link fail-
ures is assessed in Section VI-C. Section VI-D analyzes the
inﬂuence of fast control on the performance of the network
and Section VI-E discusses how the performance of a compo-
sitional path can be predicted.
A. Evaluation of a typical WirelessHART network
According to the HART Communication Foundations, in
real plant settings, on average 30% of the nodes communicate
directly with the gateway access points and about 50% are
two hops away. The remaining 20% may be 3 or 4 hops away.
Using this ratio, a typical WirelessHART network is depicted
in Figure 12, which consists of ten nodes and a gateway with
symmetric up and downlinks. Every node connects to another
node or the gateway with a bi-directional wireless link.
Fig. 12. Connectivity graph of the typical WirelessHART network
According to these paths the uplink frame-size Fup should
be at least 19 slots (3 ∗ 1 + 5 ∗ 2 + 2 ∗ 3). In every reporting
interval, ten distinct messages containing sensory data on the
devices are forwarded to the gateway. We assume a super-
frame of size Fs = 20 and communication schedule:
ηa = ((cid:104)n1, G(cid:105),(cid:104)n2, G(cid:105),(cid:104)n3, G(cid:105),(cid:104)n4, n1(cid:105),(cid:104)n1, G(cid:105),
(cid:104)n5, n1(cid:105),(cid:104)n1, G(cid:105),(cid:104)n6, n2(cid:105),(cid:104)n2, G(cid:105),(cid:104)n7, n3(cid:105),(cid:104)n3, G(cid:105),
(cid:104)n8, n3(cid:105),(cid:104)n3, G(cid:105),(cid:104)n9, n6(cid:105),(cid:104)n6, n2(cid:105),(cid:104)n2, G(cid:105),(cid:104)n10, n7(cid:105),
(cid:104)n7, n3(cid:105),(cid:104)n3, G(cid:105)).
Fig. 13. The reachability of all paths in the typical WirelessHART network
Reachability R, as deﬁned for a path can still be used in
a network. Figure 13 shows the reachability probabilities of
all ten paths with different link availabilities. The three one-
hop paths are denoted 1, 2 and 3, the ﬁve two-hop paths are
denoted 4 to 8 and the two three-hop paths are denoted 9 and
10.
The reachability of a path decreases with the number of
hops on the path. However, with a very high link availability of
π(up) = 0.9, messages still reach the gateway with probability
R > 0.999 even for three-hop paths. On the opposite, if the
links suffer from a large bit error rate during transmission,
causing a lower availability of π(up) = 0.69, the reachability
drops to 0.93. This results in a message loss of one out of 13
messages. Such a high loss probability threatens the stability
of the corresponding control-loop and possibly compromises
the whole WirelessHART system. In conclusion, the longest
path with the lowest link availability forms the bottleneck of
the network and improving the bottleneck can considerably
improve the network performance.
The delay distribution Γ of the overall network can be
derived by averaging all path delay distributions. The overall
mean delay E[Γ] is deﬁned as the average of all expected
delays:

i.e., how messages reach the gateway in the entire network.
The discrete probability distribution reﬂects the use of strict
TDMA and the delays with zero probability represent the slots
that are used for downlink trafﬁc.
It can be seen that 70.8% of the messages reach the gateway
in the ﬁrst cycle while only 21.7% of them do so in the
second cycle. Stated differently, 92.6% of the messages have
reached the gateway at the end of the second cycle (600ms)
and approximately 98.3% have reached it by the end of the
third cycle (1000ms).
The expected delay of the ten paths E[τi] are listed in Figure
15, and the overall mean delay E[Γ] is computed to be 235
milliseconds. Figure 15 clearly shows that the mean delay on
the different paths may vary a lot. Consider path 10 with an
expected delay of 421 milliseconds, which is almost twice
the overall mean delay. This bottleneck can be eliminated by
appropriate scheduling as will be discussed later.
The utilization U can be used to approximate the amount
of consumed energy due to transmissions of network nodes.
According to [16], the energy consumption of wireless radio
transmission dominates all the node power consumption since
the energy used for sensing and computations is relatively low.
The utilization U of the example network can be derived
using Equation (10) and Equation (11), Table II lists different
link availabilities together with the resulting utilization. A
lower link availability results in a higher utilization, due
to the transmission overhead that is induced by resending
messages after a link failure. Hence, bad links not only degrade
the control stability but also introduce more communication
overhead and power consumption to the network.

B. Scheduling
Scheduling aims at generating a schedule that leads to a
high network performance. The earliest arrival of a message
at the controller depends on which slot is assigned to the last
transmission. Since the communication schedule η coordinates
the transmission of messages, it inﬂuences the expected delays
of subgraphs.
It is possible to grant priority to certain paths by allowing
them to send early in the communication schedule. Commu-
nication schedule ηa, as introduced earlier offers high priority
to those paths with less hops. The opposite scheduling order,
in the following denoted ηb, ﬁrst transmits messages of long
paths.
We compare the expected delays caused by both scheduling
the
alternatives in Figure 16 and it can be observed that
expected delays of schedule ηb are more balanced than than
with ηa. The bottleneck at path 10 has been eliminated (E[τ]10
drops from 421 to 291). Instead, path 7 forms the new
bottleneck with E[τ7] = 317. Even though the overall mean
delay is slightly higher for schedule b, namely E[Γ] = 272
milliseconds, schedule ηb is considered to be better than ηa as
it better balances the delay over the different paths.
C. Stability and Robustness
Related work [4] distinguishes three types of link failures
in multi-hop control networks, namely transient errors, failures
with a random time span and permanent failure.
When a channel suffers from strong noises or co-exists
with other wireless network such as WiFi, the strong signal
interference results in a large bit error rate, and makes it
