User: Configure Nginx reverse proxy for the application
Assistant: To configure the Nginx reverse proxy for the application, you can follow the steps below: 1. Install Nginx First, you need to install Nginx, which can be installed using the package manager, for example: Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx CentOS: sudo yum install epel-release sudo yum install nginx 2. Configure virtual hosts Configuring Nginx reverse proxy for applications requires configuring a virtual host. Virtual hosts can be added by editing the Nginx configuration file, usually located in the /etc/nginx/sites-available/ or /usr/local/nginx/conf/sites-available/ directory. You can create a new virtual host configuration file, say myapp.conf, and add the following: server { listen 80; server_name myapp.example.com; access_log /var/log/nginx/myapp.access.log; error_log /var/ log/nginx/myapp.error.log; local/{proxy_pass http: // localhost: 3000; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header upgrade $ http_upgrade ; proxy_set_header connection 'upgrade'; proxy_set_header host $ Host; proxy_cache_bypass $ http_upgrade;}} listen: configure Nginx listening port - server_name: configure the domain name of the virtual host - access_log and error_log: configure the location of the access log and error log of the virtual host - location /: configure the path of the reverse proxy - proxy_pass: specify the URL of the application - proxy_http_version 1.1: Configure to use HTTP 1.1 - proxy_set_header: Set the HTTP header for the request, where Upgrade, Connection, Host and cache are specified 3. Activate the virtual host After creating the virtual host configuration file, you need to activate it in the Nginx configuration. This file can be linked into the sites-enabled directory using a soft link. For example, in Ubuntu/Debian: sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ in CentOS: sudo ln -s /usr/local/nginx/conf/ sites-available/myapp.conf /usr/local/nginx/conf/sites-enabled/ 4. Reload the Nginx configuration After configuring the virtual host, you need to reload the Nginx configuration file to make the configuration take effect. For example, in Ubuntu/Debian: sudo systemctl reload nginx In CentOS: sudo nginx -s reload After completing the above steps, the application will run through the Nginx reverse proxy. The application can be accessed by visiting myapp.example.com.
