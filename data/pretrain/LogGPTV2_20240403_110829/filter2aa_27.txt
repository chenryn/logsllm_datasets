 The stuff you’ve just seen
 Introduction to Power Laws
 What we’ve been doing; DDoS Defence
 What else you can do:
 IDS
 Diagnostics
 User ID-ing
 Then we’ll look at this tool thing I’ve thrown together
 Demo of what you can do
Introduction to Power Laws
 Natural processes, they’re 
statistical
 Things descriptive of natural 
processes follow power laws
 When they don’t, something’s 
wrong
 Not all natural processes are 
natural!
 Eg., Financial transactions
 You can use power laws to detect 
fraud.
Or more honestly, power law probability distributions
That’s a mouthful though
Why does that matter?
 Somehow network traffic is 
“natural”
 Good lord the machines are alive!
 So power laws must apply
 If they don’t, something is wrong
 Some power laws can be hard 
coded
 Extremely fast and low cost 
anomaly detection!
Benford’s Law
 Simple and awesome power law
 If it’s a number…
 Generated by a process…
 Process is natural…
 We know what the probability of 
the first digit is!
 Never changes, you can hard 
code it.
 Such speed. Wow.
What we’ve been doing:
DDoS Defence
 The more artificial the packet, the 
worse the anomaly
 Flood DDoS (Amplification, tcp, 
udp, http, etc attack) are very 
loud
 Can be clearly seen in gestalt 
connection data
 Practically instantaneous
 Real time in 100Mbit/1000Mbit 
scenarios (probably much more)
 No training at all
How we do it
 Detection processes Tcpdump
data
 Extracts features
 Power law analysis tells us 
“Goodness”
 Print out to csv with timestamp
 Or throw an alarm and do 
something
 Iptables maybe.
What you can do with that
 Watch for DDoS attacks
 Probably won’t save your network
 Can determine if someone is using 
your pc
 “DDoS zombie!” instead of “WTF is 
this”
 Determine between attack types 
too
What else you can do: IDS
 DoS isn’t the only kind of 
disturbance on a network
 Obviously we don’t know what all 
of them are
 Strap learning agent to output
 Tell it to make decisions
 Should (at the very least) detect 
active recon, even at slow speeds
What else you can do: Diagnostics
 Changes in traffic across a 
network change “power law 
profile”
 Are all the changes where you 
expect?
 Is someone doing something to 
your systems when they’re not 
around?
What else you can do: User ID-ing
 Natural systems aren’t just 
networks!
 User interaction with computer is 
too
 You can profile their keystrokes
 Profile your keystrokes
 Have your own laptop/pc as a 
honeypot.
What else you can do: Probably 
Lots More
 Very early days for power law 
based analysis
 Possible that all kinds of computer 
metrics are power law compliant
 Experiment!
 It’s cheap, fast, and simple, so why 
not?
And now, a tool that you can go experiment with
