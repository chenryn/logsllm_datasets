ATT&CK ID:M0802
ATT&CK Technique Name:Communication Authenticity
Do not inherently rely on the authenticity provided by the network/link layer (e.g., 802.11, LTE, 802.15.4), as link layer equipment may have long lifespans and protocol vulnerabilities may not be easily patched. Provide defense-in-depth by implementing authenticity within the associated application-layer protocol, or through a network-layer VPN. [7]  Furthermore, ensure communication schemes provide strong replay protection, employing techniques such as timestamps or cryptographic nonces.
