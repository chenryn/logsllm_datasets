User: How can I find where my local development datastore is located? I am using the Python SDK and Linux.
Assistant: I use OS X Mavericks (10.9), Python 2.7.5, and Google App Engine SDK 1.9.3 (Python).
None of the above worked for me, however, referencing @alsmola's answer, I executed sudo find / | grep datastore.db and found the file in /private/var/folders/vw/7w1zhkls4gb1wd8r160c36300000gn/T/appengine.YYYY.XXXXX/datastore.db (YYYY is the project name, XXXXX is my username).
