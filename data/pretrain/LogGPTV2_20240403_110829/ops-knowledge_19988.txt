User: How to optimize the performance of web applications, including adjusting server and application server parameters, caching strategies, etc.?
Assistant: 1. Adjust server parameters: - Use a lightweight web server, such as Nginx. - Adjust TCP, IP, network and other related parameters to improve transmission speed. - Make full use of server hardware resources, such as multi-core CPU, high-speed disk, etc. 2. Adjust application server parameters: - Optimize the use of resources such as threads and memory according to application load and machine configuration. - Adjust the connection pool size, timeout and other parameters related to database connection. - Select the appropriate JVM parameters according to the application operation status and platform characteristics. 3. Use caching strategies: - Front-end caching: use browsers to cache static resources, such as JS, CSS, images, etc., to reduce the number of requests. - Back-end cache: use memory, hard disk or external cache (such as Memcached, Redis) to cache dynamic data, such as database query results, HTTP request results, etc., to speed up data access. - CDN: Use CDN (Content Distribution Network) to cache static files on distributed nodes, reducing server pressure and improving response speed. 4. Compress files and images: - Compress files: Compress JS, CSS, etc. files to reduce file size. - Compress pictures: Use picture compression technology to reduce picture size, such as JPEG, PNG and other formats. 5. Use an appropriate HTTP request method: - If the requested resource does not need to be modified, use a GET request. - If the requested resource will modify the server state, use a POST request. - Try to avoid using redirection, because it will increase the delay of the request. 6. Other optimization suggestions: - Use responsive design to make the page adapt to the screen sizes of different devices. - Remove unnecessary page elements, scripts and style sheets. - Put CSS at the head of the page and JS at the bottom of the page. - Reduce the number of HTTP requests and merge multiple files into one file. - Use lazy loading technology to delay loading images and other resources to improve page loading speed.
