**ATT&CK ID:** T1615  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Group Policy Discovery

Adversaries may gather information on Group Policy settings to identify potential paths for privilege escalation, understand the security measures implemented within a domain, and discover patterns in domain objects that can be manipulated or used to blend into the environment. Group Policy is a feature of Active Directory (AD) that enables centralized management of user and computer settings. Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are containers for these settings and are stored in a predictable network path, specifically `\\SYSVOL\Policies\`.

By discovering and analyzing GPOs, adversaries can gain insights into the configuration and security posture of the target environment. This information can be leveraged to plan and execute further attacks, such as modifying GPOs to weaken security controls or to create backdoors.
