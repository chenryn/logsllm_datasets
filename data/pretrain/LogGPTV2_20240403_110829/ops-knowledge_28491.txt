User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to Undo apt-get remove? I know it is funny situation but i removed python with all associated programs from Ubuntu using sudo apt-get remove python?
Obviously i can install back python, but it will take me a lot of time to install all programs that i removed.
Maybe there is some solution?

Thanks

Assistant: There is not an easy way but if you look at /var/log/apt/history.log you can see what was removed. Just reinstall each package that was removed.
