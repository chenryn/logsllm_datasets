**Realizable Value of an IT Shared Service Center**

In the digital age, the value of an IT shared service center can be categorized into two main areas: external value and internal value.

### External Value
The external value of an IT shared service center is primarily reflected in the following aspects:

- **User Experience**: By leveraging advanced digital technologies, the IT shared service center provides users with a faster, more convenient, and more flexible end-to-end digital service experience. This includes streamlined processes, intuitive interfaces, and responsive support.

- **User Satisfaction**: The center ensures a consistent and high-quality user experience through the implementation of standardized service processes and protocols. It actively solicits and incorporates user feedback to continuously meet and exceed user needs, thereby enhancing overall satisfaction.

- **Business Empowerment**: The IT shared service center supports business growth and innovation by focusing on business value. It ensures the continuity and availability of critical business functions through process optimization and data-driven insights, enabling the organization to stay agile and competitive.

### Internal Value
The internal value of an IT shared service center is realized in the following ways:

- **Resource Integration**: The center effectively consolidates and optimally allocates IT resources that were previously dispersed across various business units. This centralization facilitates resource sharing and data integration, enhancing the organization's ability to optimize resource allocation and support strategic initiatives.

- **Cost Reduction**: By integrating and rationalizing resources, standardizing services, and improving processes, the IT shared service center reduces overall operating costs. The adoption of new technologies, such as automation and functionalization, further contributes to cost savings.

- **Efficiency Improvement**: The center streamlines service delivery, increasing the proportion of self-service options for users. This enables continuous iteration and optimization of services. As the application of digital technology deepens, the overall efficiency of the IT shared service center is progressively enhanced, leading to continuous improvement.
