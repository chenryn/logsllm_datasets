### Using Reverse Image Search Techniques and People Search Engines

People search engines utilize a variety of databases to locate information, including the deep web, which is inaccessible to typical search engines. These sources include birth and death records, public records (such as criminal and tax records), and other proprietary databases. Additionally, people search engines index results from social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, providing comprehensive result sets.

#### Applications of People Search Engines
- **Online Investigators**: Law enforcement and intelligence services use these tools to gather accurate information about their targets.
- **Employers**: Conduct background checks on potential employees.
- **Individuals**: Assess the amount of personal information available about themselves online.

### Understanding Public Records

Public records are documents that are generally produced by government entities and are intended to be non-confidential. Every individual has a set of public records, such as birth and death records. Different countries have varying regulations regarding the handling and accessibility of public records, which often contain personally identifiable information (PII).

#### Access to Public Records in the United States
In the U.S., access to national public records is governed by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which allows any person to obtain access to government information in executive branch agency records. The U.S. is unique in providing unrestricted access to public records, making searches for U.S. citizens and residents more fruitful compared to other countries.
