using a reverse image search technique. The databases used by people search engines 
to locate information are diverse. For instance, many people search engines search 
within the deep web to extract information from source databases that typical search 
engines cannot reach; these include birth and death databases, public records (such 
as criminal and tax records), and other overlooked sources (such as information stored 
in proprietary databases). Please bear in mind that the people search engines will also 
index results from social media platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn, making them 
a convenient solution to return comprehensive result sets.
Online investigators (such as law enforcement and intelligence services) need 
people search engines to acquire accurate information about their targets; other 
parties are also interested in using such services. For example, employers can conduct 
background checks on their perspective employees, and individuals can look up the 
amount of personal information that is revealed about themselves online.
 What Are Public Records?
We already talked about people search engines; these sites derive part of their results 
from public repositories. So, what do we mean when we say public records?
Public records consist of information that has been—mostly—produced by 
government entities and is meant to be nonconfidential.
Every person on Earth has a set of public records. For example, the most important—
mandatory—public records of every human is their birth and death records! Different 
countries handle public records differently, as public records will contain personally 
identifiable information (PII) about people, and exposing such details to the public is 
subject to law.
In the United States, access to national public records is governed by the Freedom 
of Information Act (FOIA),i which clearly states that any person has the right to obtain 
access to government information in executive branch agency records. Until now, the 
United States was the only country in the world that gives unrestricted access to public 
records of its citizens. This means searching for United States citizens and residents 
returns richer results compared with other countries.
Government records come in different types such as text, photographs, and maps, 
and they are stored in paper and electronic formats as well such as CD/DVDs, tapes, and 
computer databases.

Aside from laws regulating access to public records, what you need to know is that 
many online services offer access to such data for free or in exchange for a small fee.

 Online Registries
An online registry is a kind of wish list published online. The most obvious example of 
such registries is when a couple formulates a list of things they need to purchase for their 
marriage. They compile a list and publish it online publicly. When one of their friends or 
relatives buys them an item from the list, the registry provider will remove this item from 
the list and ship the purchased item to the couple.
For the purpose of OSINT investigation, online registries are useful to uncover 
personal details/wishes of the people of interest in addition to close friends (as many 
registries allow friends to post their wishes to the wall of the registry owner), especially 
after knowing that many people leave their registries available online after the 
ceremony’s end.

 Vital Records
Vital records are government records usually created by local authorities. They include 
birth and death records, marriage licenses, and divorce decrees. When searching for 
vital records, the returned result will usually come with the target’s personal details. For 
instance, a birth record will usually come with the parent’s full name, the child’s name, 
and the place where the event took place. The death record will come with the location 
where the person buried, a death certificate, and the name of the person who reported 
the event to the authorities. Marriage records will hold the couple’s parents’ names 
and the place where the marriage was registered. Finally, the divorce record will hold 
information about the couple’s children’s names. Other related records such as ancestry 
records (offered by some databases) and the mailing address of the person of interest 
can also appear when searching in vital records.
