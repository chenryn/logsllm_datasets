- **(c) Online Runtime Per Reading**

**Figure 4. Computational Performance (UK Data)**
- The computational performance is evaluated for varying numbers of readings in the input stream, ranging from 50 days to 1 year, with 1440 readings per day.
- Both CRC and DRC methods take less than 2 hours to process and stream 1 year's worth of UK data (525,600 readings in total).
- The CRC method is slightly more efficient than DRC in the streaming algorithm.
- Similar performance is observed on the UMass dataset.

**Streaming Latency:**
- Figure 4(c) shows the average runtime for streaming each reading, where ǫ ∈ [0.1, 0.3], δ ∈ [0.05, 0.15], and m ∈ [10, 30].
- The runtime is less than 0.016 seconds (≪ 1 second) for both CRC and DRC.
- Despite the relatively weaker computational power of smart meters (e.g., 120MHz [3]) compared to an experimental PC (e.g., 3.60GHz), our privacy-preserving streaming algorithm can be implemented in smart meters without any latency for high-resolution reading streams.

### Case Study

**1. Case Study Setup:**
- Three sample houses with different types (terraced, semi-detached, and detached) were selected from the UK dataset [28] for the case study.
- The houses have 18, 26, and 33 appliances installed, respectively.
- The information leakage and privacy-preserving algorithm were simulated on the data collected from these houses on January 1, 2008.
- High-resolution readings were aggregated into 15-minute intervals, a commonly used reading frequency.
- Non-electric appliances (e.g., Heating, Water Heating, and Gas Oven) that do not consume electricity were excluded from the analysis.
- Parameters specified: ǫ = 0.3, δ = 0.2, and m = 5 (5 consecutive readings forming one hour interval for testing usage patterns).

**2. Information Leakage Analysis:**
- For each house, if the information leakage of any appliance's ON status at time t exceeds ǫ = 0.3, or the information leakage of any appliance or combination of appliances in any 5 consecutive readings (including time t) exceeds δ = 0.2, the appliance(s) are considered "privacy-leaking" at time t.
- The number of privacy-leaking appliances for each reading time was identified and plotted in Figure 5, showing the number of privacy-leaking appliances at different times in the three houses.
- Some readings were found to be safe (no privacy-leaking appliances), while others were highly unsafe. Examples include:
  - **Terraced House:**
    - Safe: 9:45 AM
    - Unsafe: 7:45 AM (Bathroom Bulb, Kitchen Bulb, Bedroom Bulb (1), Bedroom Bulb (2), Refrigerator, Toaster, Kettle, Microwave)
  - **Semi-Detached House:**
    - Safe: 3:30 AM
    - Unsafe: 5:45 PM (Refrigerator, Kitchen Bulb and Living Room Bulb (as a combination), Electric Oven, Microwave, Kettle, Bathroom Bulb (1))
  - **Detached House:**
    - Safe: 10:45 PM
    - Unsafe: 6:30 PM (Kitchen Bulb, Living Room Bulb, Refrigerator, TV (CRT), Computer (1), Computer (2), Electric Oven, Dishwasher)

**3. Detailed Information Leakage:**
- An unsafe reading at 6:30 PM in the detached house (with 6 appliances having information leakage higher than 0.3) was analyzed.
- Figure 6 shows the information leakage of 30 electric appliances, derived from the candidate appliance set of the reading/consumption rate (4.94kW).
- Observations:
  - **Refrigerator:** Highly detectable (information leakage > 0.9) but does not leak private information as it is always on.
  - **Bulbs:** Different rooms may have the same consumption rate but different information leakage due to varying I[t → ax].
  - **TV (CRT):** Also a privacy risk at 6:30 PM in the detached house.

**4. Impact of Reading Frequency:**
- Figure 7 illustrates the number of privacy-leaking appliances versus reading frequency (1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes) for the three houses.
- The results show how the number of privacy-leaking appliances changes with different reading frequencies.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the computational performance and privacy risks associated with smart meter data, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm.
