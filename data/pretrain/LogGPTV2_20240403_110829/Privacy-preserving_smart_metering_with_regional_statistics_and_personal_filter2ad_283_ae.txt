for a varying number of readings in the input stream (from 50
days to 1 year, with 1440 readings per day). Both CRC and
DRC take less than 2 hours to convert and stream 1 year’s
readings in the UK data (525,600 readings in total). The CRC
option is slightly more efﬁcient than DRC in the streaming
algorithm. Note that our streaming algorithm also has similar
performance on the UMass data.
Streaming Latency. Figure 4(c) demonstrates the runtime
consumed by streaming every single reading on average, where
ǫ ∈ [0.1, 0.3], δ ∈ [0.05, 0.15] and m ∈ [10, 30]. Such
runtime is less than 0.016 second (≪ 1 second) for both
CRC and DRC. As a result, although smart meters have
relatively weaker computation power (e.g., 120MHz [3]) than
an experimental PC (e.g., 3.60GHz), our privacy preserving
streaming algorithm can be implemented in the smart meters
for high resolution reading streams without any latency.
E. Case Study
Besides conducting experiments on the overall metering
datasets, we also study the cases of speciﬁc houses.
1) Case Study Setup
We select three sample houses with different types (terraced,
semi-detached and detached) from the UK dataset [28] for
the case study. In the three houses, 18, 26 and 33 appliances
are installed, respectively. Speciﬁcally, we simulate the in-
formation leakage and the privacy preserving algorithm on
the data collected from the three houses on Jan 1, 2008.
Note that we aggregate the high-resolution readings into 15
minutes per reading, which is a commonly used reading
frequency. Also, some non-electric appliances (e.g., Heating,
Water Heating, and Gas Oven) do not consume electricity and
are not considered as leaking privacy. In this case study, we
specify ǫ = 0.3, δ = 0.2 and m = 5 (5 consecutive readings
form one hour interval for testing usage patterns in multiple
readings). Then, safe readings should make the information
leakage of each appliance not exceed 0.3 and the information
leakage of any appliance or combination of appliances in every
5 consecutive readings not exceed 0.2.
Due to ﬂuctuated power quality, the actual reading may not
equal the candidate reading derived from the labeled consump-
tion rates of the appliances (they are indeed close to each
other). For every reading, we ﬁnd its closest candidate reading
to derive the information leakage. This matches the fact that
real-life adversaries also utilize the labeled consumption rates
in their mind to learn the appliances’ ON/OFF status.
To estimate the information leakage of appliances from their

Information Leakage in the Detached House at 6:30pm (ǫ = 0.3, δ = 0.2, m = 5)
temporal usage patterns I[t → ax] ∈ [0, 1] for the day Jan 1,
2008, we perform empirical study by surveying 10 students on
campus. Every student estimates the likelihood of each of the
appliances is ON at all the timestamps on Jan 1, 2008 (which
is a generic estimate for all the households without looking
at the reading), where 24 time slots are given and every 4
readings share the same result, e.g., the information leakage
w.r.t. “TV is ON” in [8pm, 9pm) is 0.3. Finally, we average
the results for each appliance and time in all the surveys.
2) Information Leakage Analysis
From the reading stream of each house, if the information
leakage of any appliance’s ON status at time t is greater than
ǫ = 0.3, or the information leakage of any appliance or any
combination of appliances’ ON status in any 5 consecutive
readings (including time t) is greater than δ = 0.2, then such
appliance(s) are considered as “privacy-leaking appliances at
time t”. Following this rule of information leakage analysis
on the reading stream of three sample houses, we can identify
the number of “privacy-leaking appliances” for each reading
time, and then plot such results for three houses in a time series
manner in Figure 5. It shows the number of privacy-leaking
appliances at different times in such three houses. We can
also observe which original reading is safe (no privacy-leaking
appliances at a speciﬁc time), and which original reading is
unsafe and how unsafe (based on the number of privacy-
leaking appliances at a speciﬁc time). Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd
out that some readings are originally safe in every house w.r.t.
the given parameters ǫ, δ and m (e.g., 9:45am in the terraced
house, 3:30am in the semi-detached house, and 10:45pm in
the detached house on Jan 1, 2008). On the contrary, some
readings in three houses are highly unsafe, e.g., 7:45am in
the terraced house, 5:45pm in the semi-detached house, and
6:30pm in the detached house. The privacy-leaking appliances
in those readings are listed as below:
• Terraced (7:45am): Bathroom Bulb, Kitchen Bulb, Bed-
room Bulb (1), Bedroom Bulb (2), Refrigerator, Toaster,
Kettle, Microwave.
• Semi-detached (5:45pm): Refrigerator, Kitchen Bulb and
Living Room Bulb (as a combination), Electric Oven,
Microwave, Kettle, Bathroom Bulb (1).
• Detached (6:30pm): Kitchen Bulb, Living Room Bulb,
Refrigerator, TV (CRT), Computer (1), Computer (2),
Electric Oven, Dishwasher.
Furthermore, we select an unsafe reading at 6:30pm in the
detached house (6 appliances have information leakage higher
than 0.3) to demonstrate the privacy risks of all the appliances.
In Figure 6, we plot the information leakage of the 30 electric
appliances, which are obtained by examining the candidate
appliance set of the reading/consumption rate (4.94kW). Then,
we have the following observations:
• Refrigerator is the most easily detected at any time (with
an information leakage higher than 0.9 due to its high
I[t → ax]). This poses a challenge that an extremely
high I[t → ax] of an appliance (such as refrigerator)
would lead to a high overall information leakage all
the time. Nevertheless, its ON status does not leak any
private information of the consumer since almost all the
households keep their such appliances (e.g., refrigerator)
running all the time.
• Although the bulbs in different rooms of each house
may have the same consumption rate, their information
leakage at the same time might be different (since such
bulbs may have different I[t → ax] at the same time).
• In the detached house, at 6:30pm, TV is also a privacy-
