User: Please explain the key deployment processes and steps when using DevOps to ensure continuous delivery and operation of code in multiple environments.
Assistant: Using the DevOps deployment process and steps needs to ensure the following key links: 1. Automated deployment: Automate the deployment process to eliminate manual operations and manual deployments that may cause errors. Efficiently deploy applications, configurations and dependencies between different environments of an application by automating deployment using CI/CD tools and scripts. 2. Standardization of environments: Ensuring that the process of deploying applications across environments is standardized and repeatable requires ensuring consistent architecture and configuration is used across environments. To achieve this requires the use of infrastructure automation tools and configuration management tools. 3. Testing: Before a new version is deployed to a production environment, it must be rigorously tested in a test environment. This ensures that there are no unexpected bugs and issues in the production environment. 4. Reliable operation: Once the application is successfully deployed in the production environment, it needs to be ensured to run reliably to ensure that downtime and exceptions of the application are minimized. Operational monitoring tools and log management tools help you quickly identify and resolve issues. 5. Rollback: If there is a problem with the application deployed to the production environment, it is necessary to quickly roll back to the previous version of the application to ensure that the application returns to normal operation in the shortest possible time. Overall, when using DevOps, there are steps and processes that need to be automated, standardized, tested, reliably run, and rolled back to ensure the continuous delivery and operation of code in multiple environments.
