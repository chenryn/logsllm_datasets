User: I have a python script which creates some images. The script runs in Ipython IDLE as expected, however then I call IDLE from the cmd line, and include the name of the script, the script loads but does not execute. If I hit F5(run Module) then the program runs, but I wonder if it is possible to make the script run without having to press F5.
Assistant: Why not run the script directly from the command line using "python script_file.py" in your command line?
