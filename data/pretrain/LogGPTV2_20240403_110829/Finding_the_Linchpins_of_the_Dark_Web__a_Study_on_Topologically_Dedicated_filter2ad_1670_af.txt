## Traffic Comparison Before and After Parking
To analyze the traffic to these TDS domains before and after they are parked, we used the "PassiveDNS" dataset. This dataset contains aggregated DNS records with start time, end time, and lookup count, allowing us to calculate the number of lookups per day. Note that these numbers are lower bounds, as many lookups may be resolved through caching by local resolvers.

### Figure 13(a): Lookups per Day Before and After Parking
- **Before Parking**: The TDS domains redirect traffic to exploit servers to monetize it.
- **After Parking**: The new domain owners can monetize the incoming traffic through the advertising models offered by parking services.
- **Observation**: The amount of traffic does not change significantly after the domain is parked. Compromised doorway pages still redirect traffic to the TDS domains even after they are taken down and parked.

## Traffic Comparison Between Regular Parked Domains and Parked TDSes
To determine if monetizing TDSes through parking is more profitable for domainers than regular domains, we obtained 664 regular parked domains on TrafficZ name servers on November 15, one of the most reputable parking services, and compared their lookup rates using the PassiveDNS dataset.

### Figure 13(b): Traffic Volume of Regular vs. TDS Parked Domains
- **Parked TDSes**: Have more than 10 times the number of lookups per day compared to regular parked domains.
- **Observation**: Even after TDSes are taken down, they can still generate significant revenue for domainers.

## Traffic Monetization
- **Ad Networks and Ad Exchanges**: 61.66% of parked TDSes use ad-networks and ad exchanges such as DoubleClick and BidSystem.
- **Tracker Networks**: 56% go through tracker networks used for targeted advertising.
- **ZeroClick Model**: 3.94% of the parked paths monetize traffic directly through the ZeroClick model.

## Discussion
### Importance of Topological Studies
- **Background**: While dedicated malicious services have been known for a long time, topological studies on hosts playing dedicated roles in malicious web infrastructures have not been extensively conducted.
- **Significance**: Such studies are crucial as they can help detect linchpins of the dark web even before understanding their specific activities.
- **Findings**: Malicious hosts tend to have close relationships with other malicious hosts but weak connections to legitimate services. This led to the PageRank-based approach, which effectively detects these dedicated services without relying on their malicious semantics.

### Future Research
- **Further Exploration**: Paths associated with dedicated hosts link to numerous malicious non-dedicated hosts, requiring appropriate techniques for capture.
- **Detection Improvement**: More progress can be made in detecting dedicated hosts, particularly those serving doorway pages.

### TDSes: An Understudied Malicious Service
- **Long Lifespan**: TDSes have an unexpectedly long lifespan (65 days).
- **Monetization**: They continue to monetize traffic even after being taken down.
- **Questions Raised**: To what extent do they monetize traffic? How can ad networks trace whether the traffic is redirected from malicious channels?

### Attacker Countermeasures
- **IP Address Recording**: Attackers record IP addresses of visitors and deliver malicious content only once per IP.
- **Cloaking Techniques**: Various cloaking techniques are employed.
- **Research Community Response**: A distributed crawling infrastructure and leveraging normal user inputs are needed to combat attackers.

### Regulation of Taken-Down Domains
- **Current Situation**: Even after TDSes are taken down, they continue to receive a large amount of traffic from compromised doorway pages, which is leveraged by domain owners to gain revenue from ad networks.
- **Call for Action**: Such actions should be prohibited as the traffic is not valid human-generated traffic.

## Related Work
### Malicious Web Infrastructures
- **Prior Research**: Focuses on specific attack channels like spam, black-hat SEO, and malvertising.
- **Our Contribution**: Provides a topological view of malicious web infrastructures, studying dedicated malicious hosts and their relationships with other entities.

### Detection of Malicious Entities
- **Content and Redirection Chain Analysis**: Prior approaches are not robust against attackers' changing strategies.
- **Topological Features**: Our approach uses topological features, which are more difficult to evade.

### PageRank Algorithm
- **Application**: Used to differentiate between malicious and legitimate entities.
- **Effectiveness**: Proven effective in detecting spammers in social networks, online comments, and web spam pages.

## Conclusion
- **Key Findings**: Topologically dedicated hosts play central roles in the dark web, serving over 70% of the nearly 4 million malicious redirection paths collected in our research.
- **Detection Technique**: Developed a topology-based technique using the PageRank algorithm to detect these hosts.
- **TDSes**: Many of these hosts are TDSes, which have a long lifespan and continue to monetize traffic even after being taken down.
