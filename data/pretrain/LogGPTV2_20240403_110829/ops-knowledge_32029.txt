User: I like python in interactive mode when on linux. However on cygwin, the interactive mode doesn't start. I don't see the ">>>" prompt and whatever I enter doesn't result in anything.
Solved: I figured out the problem from the answers below. I was using a windows installation of python and it needs -i option to start in interactive mode.
Assistant: A Windows install of ActiveState python won't enter interactive mode, AND it will be run instead of cygwin Python even if you have cygwin Python installed, because ActiveState python inserts its bin path at the front of your Windows System PATH environment variables.
I solved it by going (in Windows) to Control Panel->System -> Advanced system settings-> Environment variables, choosing PATH, selecting Edit, and cut-pasting all the ActiveState entries from the front to the back of the PATH list.
