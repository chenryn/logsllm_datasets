I prefer using Python in interactive mode when working on Linux. However, I encountered an issue with Cygwin where the interactive mode fails to start. Specifically, the ">>>" prompt does not appear, and any input I enter does not produce any output.

**Solution:**
After reviewing some answers, I discovered that the problem was due to using a Windows installation of Python. To start the interactive mode, you need to use the `-i` option.

Additionally, if you have both ActiveState Python (a Windows installation) and Cygwin Python installed, the ActiveState version will be executed by default. This is because ActiveState Python adds its bin directory to the beginning of the Windows System PATH environment variable, overriding the Cygwin Python installation.

To resolve this, follow these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Navigate to **System** > **Advanced system settings** > **Environment Variables**.
3. Locate the **PATH** variable and select **Edit**.
4. Move all the ActiveState entries from the front to the back of the PATH list.

This adjustment ensures that the Cygwin Python installation is prioritized over the ActiveState version, allowing the interactive mode to function correctly.
