TABLE IV: Timing and transaction size of the Chainspace implementation
of the coin tumbler smart contract (described in Section V-A), measured over
10,000 runs. The transactions are independent of the number of authorities.
The notation [g] denotes the execution the procedure and [c] denotes the
execution of the checker.
primitives which takes about 10 ms (see Table I). Table III
is computed assuming two authorities; the transaction size
of Issue increases by about 132 bytes (i.e.,
the size of
the credentials) for each extra authority15 while the other
transactions are independent of the number of authorities.
Similarly, the most time consuming procedure of the coin
tumbler (Table IV) application and of the privacy-preserving
e-petition (Table V) are the checker of InitTumbler and the
checker of SignPetition, respectively; these two checkers call
the BlindVerify primitive involving pairing checks. The Pay
procedure of the coin tumbler presents the highest transaction
size as it is composed of two distinct transactions: a coin trans-
fer transaction and a Request transaction from the Coconut
contract library. However, they are all practical, and they all
