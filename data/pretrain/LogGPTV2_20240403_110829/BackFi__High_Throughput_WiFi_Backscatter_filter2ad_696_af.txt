source data [24, 47, 41]. The traces are captured for a wide
variety of scenarios for heavily loaded networks. If an AP
is not loaded and there is a lot of idle channel time, then a
BackFi AP can initiate backscatter communication anyway
by sending dummy packets just for that purpose. Hence the
interesting case is when the network is loaded and backscat-
ter opportunities are limited due to contention.
Next, we ﬁlter the traces to only contain AP transmissions
and replay the collected trace using our WARP based BackFi
AP implementation to simulate the same trafﬁc conditions.
(a)(b)294In other words, in our emulated experiment the WARP radio
only transmits when the corresponding AP transmitted in the
collected trace. We place a BackFi tag at a ﬁxed distance of
2 m from the BackFi AP. We also activate the tag only at
the times the AP is transmitting. We repeat this experiment
for each AP we captured traces for, a total of 20 different
APs. For each replay, we calculate the average throughput
obtained by the BackFi link. Fig. 12(a) plots the CDF of
these throughputs.
As we can see, in a loaded network, the BackFi link can
obtain a median throughput of 4 Mbps. For a range of 2
m, the optimal throughput when the BackFi AP is continu-
ously transmitting an excitation signal is 5 Mbps, hence this
amounts 80% of the optimal throughput under realistic WiFi
network conditions. The above number can be improved fur-
ther if more WiFi devices have BackFi functionality. Specif-
ically the above experiment assumed that only the AP has
BackFi functionality. However if we can integrate the same
into our laptops and smart-phones and turn them into gate-
ways for BackFi links, then the BackFi link can be active for
larger fractions of time.
6.4 Impact on the WiFi Network
A natural question is whether BackFi affects the perfor-
mance of the WiFi network itself when the AP is doubling up
as a WiFi backscatter reader. Speciﬁcally, one might imag-
ine that the tags backscatter signals could propagate to the
actual WiFi client which is the destination of the transmis-
sion from the AP and act as interference.
To quantify what impact one might see in a general WiFi
network, we place the BackFi AP and ten clients at random
locations in the testbed. Next we place the tag at increas-
ing distances from the AP and calculate the WiFi throughput
with and without an active BackFi tag. We repeat this ex-
periment for 30 different conﬁgurations of the AP and the
clients. We plot the throughputs with and without an ac-
tive BackFi tag for different ranges between the BackFi AP
and the tag in Fig. 12(b). The results conﬁrm the previous
benchmark, essentially when the tag and the AP reader are
extremely close (between 0.25 − 0.5m), there is a small im-
pact on network throughput of less than 10%. Otherwise
the normal WiFi network performance is negligibly affected
since the backscatter signals are so weak.
6.5 Micro-benchmark Impact on WiFi
We now evaluate the worst case scenario for the WiFi
client. This corresponds to the case where the tag is very
close to the AP (at a distance of 0.25m) because in this case
the backscatter signals would be the strongest. Next we take
a single WiFi client and place it at different distances so that
we achieve each of the different rates of WiFi. Now for each
WiFi bitrate, we evaluate the PHY layer throughput achieved
with and without a BackFi tag being active. Fig. 13.a plots
the CDF of WiFi throughputs achieved for this link with and
without a BackFi tag active. As we can see, the effect is min-
imal. The only case where there is a noticeable difference is
when the WiFi AP and the client are using the highest bi-
trate of 54 Mbps where small decreases in SNR (as shown
Figure 12: WiFi Deployments: (a) Throughput of BackFi’s tag
at a distance of 1m from the BackFi’s reader under normal WiFi
deployment. Note that BackFi tag is active only when the BackFi’s
reader is transmitting. Hence we achieve on an average 4 Mbps

throughput for all the clients at different locations as a function of
distance of tag from the AP. As the tag moves away from the AP,
it receives and radiates a smaller signal which will have smaller
effect at the client. Hence, when the tag is at 0.25 m, we see a 10%
throughput drop when tag is modulating. As the tag moves away
from AP, we see no degradation in the average throughput.
Figure 13: (a) Shows the CDF of the client throughput when the
tag is placed at 0.25m from the AP. As seen, there is almost no
degradation for lower bit rate of 6 Mbps, as client is farther from
AP and the SNR required at the client to decode 6 Mbps is small.
However, we observe noticeable difference at 54 Mbps, where both
clients are closer to BackFi’s AP and need higher SNR to decode
data. (b) shows the degradation of SNR for tag on and tag off for

in Fig. 13.b) can force the WiFi AP to occasionally switch
to lower bitrates.
7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
BackFi provides a high throughput, sufﬁcient range and
a low power backscatter communication link using ambi-
ent WiFi signals. BackFi’s range and throughput can be en-
hanced further with the use of multiple antennas at the WiFi
APs since multiple antennas at the AP provides additional
diversity combining gain. We can incorporate multiple an-
tennas at the AP with minimal changes in BackFi’s link layer
protocol. Speciﬁcally, each transmit antenna would need a
silent slot to eliminate the environmental component corre-
sponding to that antenna. We could exploit existing WiFi
MIMO packet structure for estimating the environment as
it has preamble slots where only one transmit antenna is
active. We can then perform MRC combining for the sig-
nals received across space from multiple antennas, providing
BackFi with better SNR.
We believe, the combination of performance and piggy-
backing on existing signals demonstrated by BackFi can bring
us closer to the vision of ubiquitous RF powered computing
(a)(b)(a)(b)295and communication gadgets in the physical world. However,
much work remains in realizing this vision, including de-
signing protocols to manage a network of BackFi tags con-
nected to an AP and designing techniques to ﬁgure out how
to balance sensing, computing and communication needs within
a constrained energy budget. This continues to be our future
work.
