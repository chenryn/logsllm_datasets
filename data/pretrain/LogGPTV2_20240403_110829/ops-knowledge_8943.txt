User: If I generate multiple subprocess.Popen(['commands', 'that', 'I', 'called']) and for each I do stdin.write(..) or p.communicate(...)to interact with the commands, is it guarantee to be independent and will come back to the each process (stdout from the called command)?
Assistant: I dont know about python, but as far as C is concerned, pipe is not independent for each process.
Pipes are for the sole pupose of communicating between the parent and the child processes or even between the child processes themselves.
The data written in a pipe by a particular process can be read by another process from the read end of the pipe.
