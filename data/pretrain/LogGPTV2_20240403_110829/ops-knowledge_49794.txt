Question: "An organization is evaluating different firewall technologies to protect its network infrastructure. They have a diverse network with a mix of web traffic, internal applications, and a need for detailed traffic inspection for security policy enforcement. Considering their requirements and the information provided on firewall types, which of the following statements are correct regarding the use of stateless packet filters, application-layer firewalls, and application proxies?"
 "A": "Stateless packet filters would be sufficient for the organization since they handle each packet as it arrives and require no memory or history."
 "B": "Application-layer firewalls would provide the ability to enforce more restrictive security policies by inspecting the content of the data fields."
 "C": "Using an application proxy might introduce performance bottlenecks due to funneling all outbound traffic through a few systems."
 "D": "Stateless packet filters would be the most complex to implement since they need to understand all details of the application protocols they mediate."
