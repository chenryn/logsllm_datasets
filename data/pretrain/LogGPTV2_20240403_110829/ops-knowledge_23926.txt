Question: An application uses the PHP connector for PostgreSQL to execute database queries. A developer is tasked with fetching a set number of news articles and offsetting the results based on user input. Which practice would be secure and appropriate for incorporating user input into the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses of a `SELECT` statement while mitigating the risk of SQL Injection?
"A": "Dynamically inserting user input directly into the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses without validation or sanitization.",
"B": "Casting user input to integers before including them in the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses.",
"C": "Using regular expressions to validate that user input consists solely of numeric characters before insertion into the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses.",
"D": "Implementing a fixed `LIMIT` value and ignoring user input for the `OFFSET` clause to ensure a consistent and secure query."
Answer: B
