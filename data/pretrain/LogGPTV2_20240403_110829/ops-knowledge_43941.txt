User: Describes how to use iptables for network security protection on Linux systems.
Assistant: 1. Determine the iptables version First you need to confirm your own iptables version, you can use the command "iptables -v" to check. Currently, the latest version of iptables is 1.8.7. 2. Determining the goal requires determining which services and which IP addresses we want to protect, and the security scheme we want to obtain. 3. Set firewall rules iptables operates based on rules. Firewalls can be set up in a rule-based manner to prevent illegal access, attacks and intrusions. You can use the command "iptables -L" to view the current list of rules. 4. Edit the iptables configuration file You can use the iptables configuration file to make some customized settings. The default configuration file path is /etc/sysconfig/iptables. 5. Save and apply the rules After confirming the rules, you need to save and apply the rules, you can execute the commands "service iptables save" and "service iptables restart". 6. Monitor iptables After configuring iptables, you need to continuously monitor the rules to ensure their effectiveness. You can use "iptables -L -n -v" to view the rule usage. In short, using iptables requires first confirming the version, then setting targets, editing firewall rules and configuration files, saving and applying rules, and finally continuous monitoring. This helps us better protect the security of our systems and data.
