Even when annot is set to True, setting x/yticklabels to [] causes annotations
not to show. This behavior seems odd; if I don't want annotations, I won't set
annot.
Code:
    import seaborn as sns
    sns.set()
    flights_long = sns.load_dataset("flights")
    flights = flights_long.pivot("month", "year", "passengers")
    flights.index.name = flights.columns.name = ''
    sns.heatmap(flights, annot=True, xticklabels=[], yticklabels=[], fmt="d", linewidths=.5)
What I get:

Does this seem like a reasonable use case?
