  * Windows build number: 10.0.18362.30
  * What you're doing and what's happening: When having one tab (no matter what type of terminal used) open and type `exit`, the terminal doesn't close and the cursor just blinks. However, when having more than one tabs open, the terminal tab closes just fine.
  * What's wrong / what should be happening instead: When typing `exit` in the last tab, the Windows Terminal should close alongside the open tab.
