QoE metric # 2: first-video-frame latency. We measured the
effect of the first-video-frame acceleration by enabling and disabling
this functionality during the experiment. The improvements of the
first-video-frame latency over SP at different percentiles are plotted
in Fig. 12. Without first-video-frame acceleration, the video latency
became much worse than that of SP where the 99th percentile
latency was even 14% slower. Such degradation was caused by the
excessive delay introduced by the slow path. In contrast, first-video-
frame acceleration avoided this excessive delay, and offered a much
faster video start-up as its performance was lower-bounded by the
fast path. The 99th percentile improvement was more than 32%
than that of SP. Note that the improvement became larger towards
the tail, which was expected because the difference between the
fast and slow paths also became larger at tail.
7.3 Extreme mobility
Next, we investigate how XLINK performed in extreme mobility
scenarios. We collected LTE and onboard Wi-Fi traces in subways
18The only degradation was the median RCT value in day 14, which dropped 0.7%.

and high-speed rails and conducted trace-driven evaluation with
Mahimahi emulation tools [40]. More details about our trace-driven
evaluation and sample traces are listed in Appx. B. In comparison
to XLINK, we also evaluated SP, vanilla-MP, MPTCP, and QUIC
connection migration (CM).
Fig. 13 shows the video-chunk request completion time with
median and max values, and we make the following observations:
(1) SP without CM performed poorly with any of these traces due to
the lack of mobility support. (2) CM showed improvement compared
to SP as it could migrate to a new path when the old path was
degraded. However, under extreme mobility, the new path was also
likely to degrade immediately, so migration might not be effective
and even lead to worse results than SP in some cases. Moreover, in
CM, the ùëêùë§ùëõùëë needed to be reset after migration, which triggered
slow start in congestion control, and it was the client‚Äôs responsibility
to probe a path to detect path degradation, which could take several
round-trips. As a result, CM was not responsive enough when hand-
off frequency became high. (3) MPTCP and vanilla-MP showed
improvement over SP in some cases, but in the meantime, they also
suffered from severe HoL blocking under high-speed link variations
which caused performance degradation in many cases.
In contrast, XLINK consistently outperformed other methods
with much smaller RCT in both median and max values. Because
XLINK not only effectively aggregated wireless bandwidth but also
swiftly adapted its packet distribution across fast varying links
with the real-time QoE feedback control, it overcame fast link vari-
ations and frequent hand-offs, thus offering much better support
in extreme mobility.
7.4 Energy consumption
It is essential to understand the energy consumption, as battery
life affects users‚Äô willingness of using multi-path. We measured the
normalized communication energy per bit vs. throughput of XLINK
installed on three popular 5G-NSA-capable Android smartphone
models and downloaded different sized loads (10MB-50MB).
We built an in-house energy monitoring tool with the open-
source Android APIs [48], which logged the following information
of communication modules (Wi-Fi and cellular) from the phone‚Äôs OS
kernel: time-stamp, instant current, voltage, WiFi RSSI, and cellular
RSSI. To insulate the communication module energy measurements
from other background noise, we first turned on the "airplane" mode
to kill all background processes while keeping the same screen
brightness. Then we started downloading files with XLINK with
the APP running to record the energy information. The Android
phone in our tests used Snapdragon 765G and Kirin 990 chipsets. As
for 5G new radio (NR) use cases, we want to understand when the
5G throughput could not attain its peak-rate 19 such that multi-path
should be enabled, so we capped each link‚Äôs speed to 30Mbps.
The result is shown in Fig. 14 (the top left corner is better). We
note that the use of double links could increase the instantaneous
power, but the energy per bit is not necessarily high because the
energy is equal to power √ó time, where the communication time
reduces with higher throughput. We make the following observa-
tions:
‚Ä¢ In terms of throughput, both Wi-Fi-LTE and Wi-Fi-NR showed
significant improvements over their single-path counterparts.
‚Ä¢ In terms of energy per bit, Wi-Fi-LTE and Wi-Fi-NR improved
over LTE and NR, respectively. Wi-Fi was more energy-efficient,
but its throughput was much lower than XLINK, so there is a
trade-off and XLINK is more suitable for applications requiring
high bandwidth and low latency (e.g., video applications).
8 RELATED WORK
Multi-path extensions over QUIC. QUIC, a user-space transport
over UDP initiated from Google [49], has changed the landscape of
web transport. Since 2016, the IETF QUIC working group has been
working on the various parts of its specifications (e.g., transport,
security, and recovery) [50], and they are going to become RFCs
in 2021 [14]. As QUIC is now in its final stage of standardization,
what to do with multi-path over QUIC has become one of the top
questions discussed in the working group [14, 15, 51]. Even though

several proposals introduced multi-path capabilities in QUIC [11,
12, 52, 53], today, they did not address the concerns raised by the
group regarding the deployability and benefits due to the lack of
large-scale experimental study in real-world use cases [14]. We
develop XLINK to answer these questions. Our study demonstrates
the feasibility, deployability, and benefits of multi-path QUIC as an
end-to-end service in commercial large-scale short video services.
Multi-path TCP. MPTCP was standardized in 2013[4], but to date,
it is only available in a few mobile OSs [22]. The reason for the
slowing adoption in the Internet is not only due to the fact that
deploying MPTCP is hard in practice [6], but also the performance
issues caused by problems such as MP-HoL blocking [6, 17] and con-
cerns about the costs when aggregation is enabled [16]. A large body
of work on MPTCP from in-lab controlled experiments revealed
that MPTCP could outperform single-path TCP, but many factors
(e.g., download size, the disparity between two paths) affected the
performance [43, 54]. Indeed, we argue that multi-path features
needed by different applications can vary significantly. Hence, a
user-spaced multi-path approach that collaborates closely with an
application is a pivotal step to move forward. XLINK, tailored for
short videos, demonstrates the power of such an application-driven
approach in multi-path.
Packet scheduling in multi-path. A multi-path packet sched-
uler is the most critical component that impacts any multi-path
transport performance. The default MPTCP implementation selects
the path with the lowest RTT from those with available congestion
windows and uses opportunistic retransmission and penalization
to mitigate the HoL-blocking [6]. Penalization lowers down the
aggregated capacity. Several improvements have been proposed to
address the limitations of penalization [18, 19, 55] based on network
predictions. However, these estimations vary significantly in highly
mobile scenarios and thus are not accurate enough. Both STMS [20]
and DEMS [8] achieve in-order-receive through out-order-sending.
STMS estimates the gap in packet sequence number between the
paths, while DEMS decouples sub-flows by splitting a data chunk
into two sub-flows. Other low latency MPTCP solutions (e.g., [56])
do not apply to video services as they achieve low latency through a
large amount of redundancy. XLINK differs from these approaches.
It is designed with scalability and deployability in mind, leverages
real-time remote QoE-feedback to overcome HoL blockings, and
balances performance and cost. Moreover, XLINK‚Äôs scheduler is
video-centric, supporting the expression of video QoE-awareness
with priority-based re-injections at both stream and video-frame
levels.
Cross-layer video improvement. XLINK is also closely related to
cross-layer video QoE enhancement techniques [41, 57‚Äì60], such
as DASH [57‚Äì59] and RTC [41, 60]. XLINK is inspired by these
past works but differs from them in that instead of the bit-rate
adaptation techniques that are limited to a single path‚Äôs capacity,
XLINK applies QoE control to multi-path adaptation, which cost-
efficiently aggregates multiple paths‚Äô bandwidth. We also notice
that bit-rate adaptation can be applied in multi-path. For exam-
ple, MP-DASH [46] introduces MPTCP support for DASH, but as
MPTCP lives in the kernel, a tight integration of DASH and MPTCP
is not easy [47]. Thus MP-DASH uses a coarse-grained decision
logic which decides whether the cellular sub-flow should be acti-
vated or not. Meanwhile, the multi-path scheduler in [61] is also
429
coarse grained where it simply prioritizes video packets in MPTCP.
In contrast, XLINK‚Äôs control is much more fine grained in time (hun-
dreds of milliseconds), and we believe the XLINK‚Äôs feedback-based
fine-grained adaptation could serve as a powerful, flexible and easy-
to-use framework for future multi-path research.
9 DISCUSSIONS AND LIMITATIONS
Cellular cost: The client‚Äôs cellular cost is another important factor
that may affect the adoption of multi-path transport. As XLINK
is integrated as a part of a phone app, we provide two solutions.
(1) The first one is a zero-rating service in our app, for which we
collaborate with mobile carriers so that customers enrolled in a
special data plan can use our app at free charge. (2) The second one
is a switch button in the app so a user can decide to turn on XLINK
when needed.
Congestion control fairness: Our current implementation of
XLINK uses ‚Äúdecoupled‚Äù Cubic congestion control, as in other mo-
bile multi-path transport [46, 47]. The reason behind this is that
WiFi and cellular networks are unlikely to share the bottleneck link
that is often the ‚Äúlast mile" for wireless networks; this even holds
for 5G NSA as reported in [36]. However, with the deployment of
5G SA, there is a possibility that the bottleneck moves from the
"last mile" to other parts of the network (e.g., close to CDN servers)
and two paths share the bottleneck. In this case, the coupled variant
is preferred for fairness [62]. While the focus of this paper is not
congestion control, the congestion control fairness of XLINK is
worth further investigation.
10 CONCLUSION
Despite the vast interests from research, large-scale deployments
of multi-path transport have been slow over the past decade in the
public Internet. We believe that the emergence of QUIC as an end-
to-end solution has brought the critical opportunity to change the
landscape. We present XLINK, a QoE-driven multi-path transport
implemented as a lightweight extension over QUIC, and conducted
a large-scale experimental study in our e-commerce short video
services. With XLINK, we proved the feasibility, deployability and
benefits of multi-path QUIC. We believe that the implications of
such a QoE-driven approach extend beyond short videos and pave
the way for exciting new avenues for exploration in multi-path
transport such as long-form VoDs, live-streaming, AR, and VR.
