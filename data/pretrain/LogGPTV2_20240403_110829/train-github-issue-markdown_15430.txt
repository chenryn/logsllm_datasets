I don't know if this would come under feature request or a bug or if this is
just expected and things should be handled differently in
shouldComponentUpdate.
Current behaviour : If A is a component which renders B and passes C as
children to B. Now if A re-renders for some state change of which no part is
passed to B or C so basically nothing changes in the subtree of B. B still
always re-renders.

this is the fiddle to reproduce this issue. Click on C to make state change in
A and B re-renders.
Here the effect is not much but in some cases children is passed some level
deep and can cause un-necessary re-renders.
this is in React-16 and previous versions.

this is a question where some of the observations are posted feel free to
answer there only if this is expected or should be handled in a different way.
