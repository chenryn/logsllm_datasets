**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`):
    Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"4", GitVersion:"v1.4.5", GitCommit:"5a0a696437ad35c133c0c8493f7e9d22b0f9b81b", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2016-10-29T01:38:40Z", GoVersion:"go1.6.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
    Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"4", GitVersion:"v1.4.5", GitCommit:"5a0a696437ad35c133c0c8493f7e9d22b0f9b81b", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2016-10-29T01:32:42Z", GoVersion:"go1.6.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** : Docker container
  * **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
  * **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`): Linux 37638c28ef33 4.8.4-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Oct 22 18:26:57 CEST 2016 x86_64 GNU/Linux (apparently uname -a shows the host system on containers?)
  * **Install tools** : gcloud
  * **Others** : Docker container running the deployment script on our CI (Codeship)
**What happened** : Our deploy script reads our yaml files and feeds them to
`kubectl apply -f`. Today we didn't have a regular error like "this property
can't be updated", it gave us a server error apparently applying a bad patch
to the kubernetes resource.  
Here is the stderr output:

**What you expected to happen** : kubectl apply either refuse to send the
patch if we're doing some impossible update or successfully update the
deployment.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to reproduce it. After the error I took the same
yaml file used when the error happened and kubectl apply worked without
errors.
