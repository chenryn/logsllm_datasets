    const { test } = require('@playwright/test');
    const { SimResults } = require('../selectors/simulationResults');
    const playwright = require('playwright');
    test.describe('Output Edit', () => {
      test('Simulations page', async ({ page }) => {
        for (const browserType of ['chromium', 'firefox', 'webkit']) {
          const browser = await playwright['chromium'].launch();
          const context = await browser.newContext();
          const page = await context.newPage();
          await page.goto('https://www.google.com');
          await page.click(SimResults.SimResultPage.simPage(2));
