authentication mechanism, using the multipath effect between a
transmitter and a receiver to provide authentication of wireless
signals. This paper identiﬁes a new attack, called mimicry attack,
against the existing wireless link signature schemes. An attacker
can forge a legitimate transmitter’s link signature as long as it
knows the legitimate signal at the receiver’s location, and the
attacker does not have to be at exactly the same location as
the legitimate transmitter. We also extend the mimicry attack to
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and conclude
that the mimicry attack is feasible only when the number
of attacker’ antennas is equal to or larger than that of the
receiver’s antennas. To defend against the mimicry attack, this
paper proposes a novel construction for wireless link signature,
called time-synched link signature, by integrating cryptographic
protection and time factor into wireless physical layer features.
Experimental results conﬁrm that the mimicry attack is a real
threat and the newly proposed time-synched link signatures are
effective in physical layer authentication.

I. INTRODUCTION
W IRELESS physical layer security is becoming increas-
ingly important as wireless devices are more and more
pervasive and adopted in critical applications. There have
been multiple proposals in recent years to provide enhanced
wireless security using physical layer characteristics, including
ﬁngerprinting wireless devices (e.g., [1]–[4]), authenticating
and identifying wireless channels (e.g., [5], [6]), and deriving
secret keys from wireless channel features only observable to
the communicating parties (e.g., [7], [8]).
Among the recent advances in wireless physical
layer
security is (wireless)
link signature. Link signature uses
the unique wireless channel characteristics (e.g., the multi-
path effect) between a transmitter and a receiver to provide

authentication of the wireless channel. Three link signature
schemes [5], [6], [9] have been proposed so far. Since its
initial
introduction, link signature has been recognized as
a physical layer authentication mechanism for applications
where wireless channel characteristics is unique for individual
nodes (e.g., [2], [7], [10]–[12]). In this paper, we identify the
mimicry attack against these link signature schemes.
We start our investigation with the link signature scheme
in [5]. It is assumed in [5] that an attacker “cannot ‘spoof’ an
arbitrary link signature” and that the attacker “will not have
the same link signature at the receiver unless it is at exactly
the same location as the legitimate transmitter”. However,
we show in this paper that an attacker can forge an arbitrary
link signature as long as it knows the legitimate signal at the
receiver’s location, and the attacker does not have to be at
exactly the same location as the legitimate transmitter in order
to forge its link signature.
We also extend the mimicry attack to the link signature
scheme in [9]. Since the last link signature scheme in [6] is
essentially an integration of the techniques in [5] and [6],
all existing link signature schemes are vulnerable to the
mimicry attack. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that if the receiver has
two antennas to cooperatively authenticate the transmitter, the
attacker with only one antenna cannot successfully launch the
mimicry attack. However, we discover that the mimic attack
is still feasible if the attacker also has two antennas.
Then we explore the feasibility of the mimicry attack
into MIMO systems. If the number of the receiver’s receive
antennas is larger than that of the attacker’s transmit antennas,
the receiver can detect the mimicry attack, otherwise, the
receiver can be fooled that the attacker’s link signatures are
the same with the ones of the authenticated transmitter’s.
The mimicry attack can apply to the following example
scenarios when link signatures are used for authentication:
(1) launching location spooﬁng attacks: an attacker can utilize
a fake location to fool a target receiver by creating a fake wire-
less link signaturer; (2) bypassing motion detection systems:
an attacker could maintain its wireless signature unchanged
while it is actually moving, thus from the perspective of the
target receiver, who utilizes the wireless link signature to
determine whether the transmitter moves or not, the attacker
appears to remain stationary; (3) bypassing wireless trans-
mitter authentication systems: an attacker can impersonate a
legitimate transmitter by forging its wireless link signature.
To provide physical
layer authentication capability and
defend against the threats identiﬁed in this paper, we develop

signal copies. Each path imposes a response (e.g., distortion
and attenuation) on the signal traveling along it [5], and the
superposition of all responses between two nodes is referred
to as a channel impulse response [15].
The multipath effects between different pairs of nodes are
usually different, and so are the channel impulse responses [5].
Due to this reason, a channel
impulse response between
two nodes is also called a link signature, and has been pro-
posed to provide robust location distinction and location-based
authentication [5], [6], [11]. Speciﬁcally, when a transmitter
and attackers are in different locations, to determine whether
a received signal is from the transmitter, the receiver can
estimate the link signature of the received signal and compare
it with the known value from the transmitter. The received
signal is accepted only if the estimated link signature is similar
to the known value.
B. Estimating Channel Impulse Responses
A popular method for estimating channel impulse responses
is the training sequence based estimation [16]. The transmitter
ﬁrst sends a training sequence (i.e., a sequence of bits) over the
wireless channel. The receiver then uses the training sequence
and the corresponding received signal samples to estimate
channel impulse responses, where the data value of the training
sequence can be pre-shared [16] or reconstructed from the
received signal through demodulation [5].
Note that at the physical layer channel estimation can be
processed in either frequency domain (e.g. [5], [6]) or time
domain (e.g., [16]). Because of the linear relationship between
the two domains, frequency and time domain based methods
are inter-convertible. In the following, we describe the channel
estimation method in the time domain.

1) Mathematical Formulation: To transmit
the training
sequence, the transmitter converts it into M physical layer
symbols (i.e., complex numbers that are transmission units
at
then sends
the physical
the M symbols to the wireless channel.
Let x = [x1, x2, . . . , x M] denote the transmitted symbols
in the training sequence. Assume that there exist L paths.
Thus, the receiver can receive L copies of x, each traveling
on one path and undergoing a response (i.e., distortion and
attenuation) caused by the corresponding path. The vector y of
received symbols is the convolution sum of the L copies of x.
Let h = [h1, h2, . . . , h L]T be the channel impulse response,
where hi is the response of the i-th path, and n denote the
channel noise. Thus, the received symbols y can be represented
by y = h ∗ x + n [16], where ∗ is the convolution operator.

a novel construction for link signature, which is called time-
synched (i.e., time synchronized) link signature. Time-synched
link signature integrates cryptographic protection as well as
time factor into the wireless physical
layer features, and
provides an effective and practical solution for authenticating
physical layer wireless signals. We also perform an exten-
sive set of experimental evaluation of the mimicry attacks
and the time-synched link signature scheme on the USRP2
platform [13] running GNURadio [14]. Our experiments show
that the mimicry attack can deteriorate the success rate of dis-
tinguishing between the legitimate transmitter and the attacker
to 0.5935, which is close to a blind guess. However, with an
optimum threshold, the proposed time-synched link signature
is able to restore the success rate to 0.9365.
Our contribution in this paper is three-fold. First, we
identify the mimicry attack against existing link signature
schemes and extend the mimicry attack to MIMO systems.
Second, we develop the time-synched link signature scheme
to defend against various threats against existing link signature
schemes, including the mimicry attacks presented in this paper.
Finally, we perform extensive experiments to conﬁrm the
threats of the mimicry attack and demonstrate the effectiveness
of the time-synched link signature for physical layer authen-
tication.

II. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we give some preliminary information on
link signatures, including multipath effect, channel impulse
response, and how these are used for wireless link signatures.
A. Multipath Effect, Channel Impulse Response
Wireless signal usually propagates in the air along multiple
paths due to reﬂection, diffraction, and scattering [5]. For
example, as shown in Figure 1, the receiver receives multiple
copies of the transmitted signal from different paths, each of
which may have a different delay due to the path it traversed
on. The received signal is indeed the sum of these time delayed

Rewriting Equation (1) in a compact matrix form gives us
y = Xh + n,
(2)
where X is a (L + M − 1) × L Toeplitz matrix, containing
L delayed versions of the transmitted symbols x, and y is a
vector consisting of (L + M − 1) received symbols.
2) Estimation: Two types of estimators are generally used
to estimate h from Equation (2): least-square (LS) and linear
minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) [17]. If the statistical
distribution of the channel impulse responses and noise are
unknown, the LS estimator is usually used. If the statistical
distribution of the channel impulse responses and noise are
known, the LMMSE estimator is often used. For the LS esti-
mator, the estimation result is given by ˆhL S = (XH X)−1XH y,
where XH is the conjugate transpose of X and ()−1 is the
matrix inverse operation [18]. For the LMMSE estimator, the
(XXH )−1)−1ˆhL S,
estimation result is: ˆhL M M S E = Rh(Rh + σ 2
where Rh is the channel correlation matrix (i.e., the statistical
expectation of hhH ) and σ 2
n is the variance of the noise [19].

III. MIMICRY ATTACK
In this section, we present the mimicry attack against link
signature schemes [5], [6], [9].
A. Overview
Let yt and ya denote the received symbols that are from the
transmitter and the attacker, respectively. The attacker’s goal is
to make ya approximately the same as yt . When the receiver
attempts to extract the link signature from ya, it will get a link
signature that is very similar to the one estimated from yt.
As a result, the attacker can impersonate the transmitter to
bypass link signature based authentication.
The attacker needs to meet two requirements to launch a
mimicry attack: First, the attacker needs to know the transmit-
ter’s symbols (i.e., yt ) at the receiver’s location. Second, the
attacker needs to manipulate its own symbols to be transmitted
such that when they arrive at the receiver they are similar to
those from the transmitter (i.e., ya ≈ yt ).
B. Obtaining Transmitter’s Symbols
There are multiple ways for the attacker to obtain the
transmitter’s symbols at the receiver’s location. For example,
