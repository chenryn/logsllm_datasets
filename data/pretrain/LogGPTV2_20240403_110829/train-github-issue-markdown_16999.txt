### Bug Fixes for `Table` and `TableBody` Components

I have implemented some bug fixes for the `Table` and `TableBody` components in version `v0.20.0`. How can I submit these changes as a pull request (PR)? There doesn't seem to be a base branch for this specific version.

#### Code Changes
- **Fix 1:** When all rows are selected and then any row is de-selected, all other rows were being de-selected as well. This has been fixed so that only the de-selected row is unchecked, while the others remain checked. (Commit: 9cdd915)
- **Fix 2:** Selecting all rows via the table body (not using the "select all" checkbox in the header) did not automatically check the "select all" checkbox when all child rows were selected. This has been corrected so that the "select all" checkbox is now checked when all child rows are selected. (Commit: c006878)

_Note: I added an optional parameter to the `onRowSelection()` function to address this issue. However, I am unsure if this is the best approach, as the parameters for this function are not documented in the table documentation._

### Expected Behavior
- Selecting all rows and then de-selecting any row should leave the other rows checked.
- Selecting all rows via the table body should automatically check the "select all" checkbox in the header when all child rows are selected.

### Current Behavior
- De-selecting any row after selecting all rows de-selects all other rows.
- Selecting all rows via the table body does not automatically check the "select all" checkbox in the header.

### Steps to Reproduce
- Select all rows.
- De-select one of the rows.
- Observe that all other rows are also de-selected.
- Select all rows via the table body.
- Observe that the "select all" checkbox in the header is not checked.

### Context
I encountered these issues while implementing a table view in my UI, where I needed to use the checkboxes for a multi-delete feature.

### Environment
- **Material-UI Version:** v0.20.0
- **React Version:** 15.6.2
- **Browser:** Chrome 63.0.3239.132
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 (64-bit)

If you could guide me on how to proceed with the PR, it would be greatly appreciated.
