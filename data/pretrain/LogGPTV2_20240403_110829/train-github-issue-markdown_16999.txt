Bug fixes to `Table` and `TableBody` components.
I have made some bug fixes to `v0.20.0`, how can I submit them as a PR?
There's no base branch for that version.
See the code changes.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Two behaviours I observed, and provided fixes for:
  * Selecting all rows then de-selecting any row, de-selected all rows. Changed so all other rows remain checked (9cdd915)
  * Selecting all rows via the body (not using select all checkbox in header), would not automatically check the 'select all' checkbox when all child rows were selected. Changed so 'select all' checkbox is now checked when all child rows are selected (c006878). _I'm not sure if my approach is the best way to address this, as I've added an optional parameter to`onRowSelection()`, parameters are not documented (see table docs)._
## Current Behavior
Described above
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Described above
## Context
I noticed these issues when implementing a table view in my UI and needing to
use the check boxes for a multi-delete feature.
