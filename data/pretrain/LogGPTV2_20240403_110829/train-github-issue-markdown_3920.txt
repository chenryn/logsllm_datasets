# Environment
    Windows build number: 18990
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.5.2661.0
    Any other software?
    tmux 2.8
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Install Windows Terminal 0.5.2661.0 on a machine where tmux 2.8 has been installed and displaying correctly with previous Windows Terminal releases.
  2. Open a WSL shell in a Terminal tab, inside _tmux_.
  3. Run any command which displays text wide enough to use the rightmost column of the screen. For the example screenshots below, I used _env_.
  4. After observing initial behavior, clear the screen with _clear_ .
# Expected behavior
Clean display of command output without character smear; all characters
removed when screen cleared.
# Actual behavior
On initial run of the command in step 3, the rightmost character of the last
line to contain one is "smeared" down the screen until another rightmost
character replaces it, thus:

When the screen is subsequently cleared, all characters displayed in this
column remain visible:

Thus far, I have only been able to reproduce this behavior inside a tmux
session, although it was not observed until the latest Windows Terminal
update. Additionally, I was using Cascadia Code as my terminal font also
previous to that upgrade, without problems.
