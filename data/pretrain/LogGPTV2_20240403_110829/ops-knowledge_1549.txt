User:  How to configure Nginx server to provide reverse proxy service for multiple domain names?
Assistant: The following are the steps to configure the Nginx server to provide reverse proxy services for multiple domain names: 1. Install the Nginx server, skip this step if it has already been installed. 2. Create a new Nginx configuration file, such as /etc/nginx/conf.d/myproxy.conf. 3. Add the following content in the configuration file to use reverse proxy to example.com: ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend.example.com; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ``` In this configuration, Nginx listens on port 80, all HTTP requests will be redirected to backend.example.com, here we assume that backend.example.com is Have an accessible web server. 4. Then, you can add more server blocks to reverse proxy other domain names as needed, as follows: ``` server { listen 80; server_name example2.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend.example2. com; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ``` 5. Save and exit the file. Then, restart the Nginx server for the changes to take effect. For example, restart Nginx with the following command: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` 6. Make sure your DNS configuration is correct, pointing the domain names of example.com and example2.com to the IP address of the current server. Once done, you should be able to access these domain names through a browser or other HTTP client and should be properly redirected to the backend server. 7. The reverse proxy can also use SSL/TLS for encryption to provide better security. In this case, you can refer to Nginx's SSL/TLS documentation to learn how to configure certificates and other related settings.
