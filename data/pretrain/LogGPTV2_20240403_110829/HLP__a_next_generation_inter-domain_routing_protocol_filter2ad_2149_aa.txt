## Abstract
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the current inter-domain routing protocol, is known to have several deficiencies. This paper introduces a hybrid link-state and path-vector protocol called HLP as an alternative to BGP. HLP offers significantly better scalability, isolation, and convergence properties. Using existing BGP routing data, we demonstrate that HLP can reduce the churn rate of route updates by a factor of 400 and confine the impact of routing events to a region 100 times smaller than BGP. For most Internet routes, HLP ensures worst-case linear-time convergence. We also present a prototype implementation of HLP on the XORP router platform. While HLP is not intended as a final proposal for replacing BGP, it serves as a starting point for discussions on the design of next-generation inter-domain routing protocols.

## 1. Introduction
Inter-domain routing presents a complex set of algorithmic and policy challenges. On one hand, any inter-domain routing protocol must meet basic algorithmic requirements such as scalability, robustness, and rapid convergence, given the size and rapid growth of the Internet. On the other hand, economic considerations necessitate support for policy routing, where ISPs can implement a wide range of private routing policies that they choose not to disclose. The routing protocol should also provide sufficient information to enable ISPs to make informed policy decisions.

Designing an inter-domain protocol that satisfies both algorithmic and policy requirements is highly challenging. There is an inherent conflict between the need for fully-informed and private routing policies and the requirement for robust routing algorithms. BGP takes an extreme position in this design space, keeping all routing policies private and transmitting no policy information in route updates. As a result, BGP suffers from poor scalability, minimal fault isolation, and slow convergence due to uninformed path exploration. These issues, which were minor nuisances in the early days of the Internet, are becoming increasingly serious as expectations and demands on the Internet grow.

Although BGP does not distribute policy information, certain policies are still inferable from the reachability and path information it provides. Specifically, most provider-customer relationships can be inferred from the distributed routing information. Additionally, even though BGP provides complete path information, the majority of implemented policies do not use this information. This suggests that BGP's approach of full privacy and full path information may not be necessary or even feasible.

In this paper, we explore a less extreme design point by proposing and evaluating HLP, a hybrid link-state and path-vector routing protocol. HLP's design philosophy is to expose common policies and withhold some path information. This common case of policies assumes that most Internet routes (99%) follow the structure of the Autonomous System (AS) hierarchy, which is largely inferable and relatively stable. By optimizing the routing protocol based on this structure, HLP leverages the common-case policy behavior that BGP cannot hide and optimizes the protocol for this common case. For policies that do not fit the common case, HLP uses mechanisms similar to BGP to accommodate them.

HLP uses explicit information hiding to limit the global visibility and effect of routing events across provider-customer hierarchies. This improves scalability and isolation properties. If every routing event were globally visible, the network churn would grow at least linearly with the network size, which is undesirable. HLP limits the visibility of routing information using the provider-customer hierarchy, fitting today's routing assumptions and requiring minimal modifications for deployment.

HLP provides substantially improved scalability, isolation, convergence, and fault diagnosis properties. For the current Internet topology, the churn rate of HLP route advertisements is approximately 400 times lower than BGP. For about 50% of inter-AS links, HLP can isolate the effects of a fault to a region 100 times smaller than BGP. HLP achieves linear-time convergence for most Internet routes by explicitly constraining the path-exploration process. It supports most of BGP's policies and enables new ones. HLP also replaces BGP's prefix-deaggregation approach to traffic engineering with a cleaner, cost-based approach, addressing many security and fault diagnosis problems of BGP.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
- Section 2 highlights the pressing problems of BGP and discusses the design issues.
- Sections 3 and 4 describe the HLP protocol and analyze its properties.
- Section 5 discusses traffic engineering issues in HLP.
- Section 6 presents the router-level perspective of HLP.
- Section 7 describes related work.
- Section 8 concludes the paper.

## 2. Design Rationale

### 2.1 Problems with BGP
The IRTF convened two working groups to define the requirements for a future inter-domain routing protocol. From their combined specifications, we selected five key requirements and describe how BGP fails to meet them:

- **Scalability**: BGP's routing state and churn rate grow linearly with the network size, making it unsuitable for the growing Internet.
- **Convergence and Route Stability**: BGP suffers from significant route instabilities, oscillations, and long convergence times.
- **Isolation**: BGP has poor fault isolation properties, with local faults often having global impacts.

### 2.2 Basic Design Issues
We contrast BGP's approach with HLP's along four design issues: routing structure, policy, routing granularity, and routing style. Table 1 summarizes the primary distinctions between HLP and BGP.

#### 2.2.1 Routing Structure
BGP reveals complete path information to support general path-based policies, leading to global visibility of local routing events and poor fault isolation. HLP hides some path information using the natural hierarchical routing structure defined by AS relationships, limiting the visibility of small-scale routing dynamics.

#### 2.2.2 Policy
BGP keeps policy information private but allows inference of provider-customer relationships. HLP explicitly publishes these relationships and restricts available paths to those that obey the hierarchies, allowing for the recognition of misconfigurations and limiting the propagation of route advertisements.

#### 2.2.3 Routing Granularity
BGP uses prefix-based routing, leading to deaggregation for traffic engineering, multihoming, and policy routing. HLP optimizes for common-case policies and uses a more efficient, cost-based approach to traffic engineering, reducing the need for prefix deaggregation.

### 2.2.4 Routing Style
BGP uses a path-vector style, while HLP combines link-state and path-vector approaches to achieve better performance and stability.
