ABSTRACT
It is well-known that BGP, the current inter-domain rout-
ing protocol, has many deﬁciencies. This paper describes a
hybrid link-state and path-vector protocol called HLP as an
alternative to BGP that has vastly better scalability, isolation
and convergence properties. Using current BGP routing in-
formation, we show that HLP, in comparison to BGP, can
reduce the churn-rate of route updates by a factor 400 as
well as isolate the eﬀect of routing events to a region 100
times smaller than that of BGP. For a majority of Internet
routes, HLP guarantees worst-case linear-time convergence.
We also describe a prototype implementation of HLP on top
of the XORP router platform. HLP is not intended to be a
ﬁnished and ﬁnal proposal for a replacement for BGP, but
is instead oﬀered as a starting point for debates about the
nature of the next-generation inter-domain routing protocol.

INTRODUCTION
Inter-domain routing presents a formidable combination
of algorithmic and policy challenges. On the one hand, given
the size and the rapid growth of the Internet, any inter-
domain routing protocol should satisfy basic desirable algo-
rithmic properties, such as scalability, robustness, and rapid
convergence. On the other hand, for economic reasons inter-
domain routing should support policy routing, where ISPs
have the ﬂexibility to implement a wide variety of private
routing policies that ISPs choose not to reveal. Moreover,
the routing protocol should provide suﬃcient information to
enable ISPs to make informed policy decisions.

Designing an inter-domain protocol that satisﬁes both the
algorithmic and policy requirements represents a very chal-
lenging task. There is an inherent conﬂict between the eco-
nomic need for fully-informed and private routing policies
and the structural need for robust routing algorithms. One
could consider a spectrum of designs making diﬀerent trade-
oﬀs. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) takes an extreme
position in this design space that all routing policy must be
private; no policy information is transmitted in route up-
dates, leaving policy to be implemented entirely by local
ﬁlters whose contents are kept secret. As a result, BGP suf-
fers from inherent algorithmic problems, including poor scal-
ability, minimal fault isolation, and slow convergence due to
uninformed path exploration.1 These problems, while mere
nuisances in the Internet’s early days, are becoming signiﬁ-
cantly more serious as expectations and demands placed on
the Internet increase.
Although BGP does not distribute policy information, in
practice it is impossible to hide certain policies because the
routing protocol must distribute reachability and path infor-
mation. Speciﬁcally, most provider-customer relationships
are easily inferable from routing information distributed to
the entire Internet [27, 9]. In addition, even though BGP
provides complete path information to all ISPs, the vast ma-
jority of implemented policies do not use this information.
This suggests that the extreme position taken by BGP, keep-
ing full privacy and providing full path information, is not
needed, nor perhaps even tenable.
In this paper, we explore a design point that is less ex-
treme than BGP by proposing and evaluating a hybrid link-
state path-vector routing protocol, called HLP. The design
philosophy of HLP is to expose the common case of policies
and to withhold some path information. This common case
of policies exploits the assumption that a majority of In-
ternet routes (99%) obey the structure of the Autonomous
System (AS) hierarchy as imposed by provider-customer re-
lationships. Given that this structure is largely inferable
today [9, 27] and relatively stable (as we show later in this
paper), HLP optimizes the routing protocol based on this
structure. By analyzing the evolution of Internet routing
and the growth of the Internet routing structure, we contend
that this common case of policies is not merely an artifact of
today’s practices but is bound to stay as a common-case be-
havior in the future. In essence, HLP leverages the common-
case policy behavior that BGP cannot hide and optimizes
the protocol design for this common case. For routing poli-
cies that do not ﬁt the common case behavior, HLP resorts
to mechanisms resembling those of BGP to accommodate
them.
1While some problems have been dealt with by modest in-
cremental modiﬁcations [22, 7, 29], we contend that many of
the problems are fundamental to BGP’s basic architecture.
13The central idea used in HLP to optimize for the com-
mon case is to use explicit information hiding of unneces-
sary routing updates across provider-customer hierarchies
and thereby limiting the global visibility and eﬀect of rout-
ing events.
Information hiding is fundamentally required
to improve the scalability and isolation properties of inter-
domain routing.
If every routing event is globally visible,
then the network churn grows at least linearly (if not super-
linear) with the network size, which is clearly undesirable.
HLP uses the provider-customer hierarchy to limit the vis-
ibility of routing information across hierarchies. Moreover,
HLP’s information hiding mechanism naturally ﬁts today’s
routing assumptions and requires minimal modiﬁcations for
deployment.
Information hiding on HLP gives substantially improved
scalability, isolation, convergence and fault diagnosis prop-
erties. For the current Internet topology, the churn rate of
HLP route advertisements is roughly 400 times less than
with BGP. For roughly 50% of inter-AS links, HLP can
isolate the eﬀects of a fault to a region 100 times smaller
than that of BGP. For most Internet routes, HLP achieves
linear-time convergence by explicitly constraining the path-
exploration process. HLP can support most of BGP’s poli-
cies and also enables some new ones. HLP also replaces
BGP’s preﬁx-deaggregation approach to traﬃc engineering,
which can aﬀect route convergence and cause churn, with a
cleaner approach based on cost-based traﬃc engineering and
static preﬁx deaggregation. HLP also addresses many of the
security and fault diagnosis problems of BGP, but we do not
discuss these issues in this paper due to space constraints.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Sec-
tion 2, we highlight some of the pressing problems of BGP
and elaborate upon the diﬀerent design issues that confront
the designer of any inter-domain routing protocol. In Sec-
tions 3 and 4, we describe the HLP protocol and analyze
its properties. In Sections 5, we discuss traﬃc engineering
issues in HLP and present the router level perspective of
HLP in Section 6. We describe related work in Section 7
and conclude in Section 8.
2. DESIGN RATIONALE
We start this section by highlighting three speciﬁc press-
ing deﬁciencies of BGP. We then describe four basic design
issues and contrast the decisions taken in HLP to those in
BGP.
2.1 Problems with BGP
The IRTF convened two separate working groups to de-
ﬁne the set of requirements for a future generation inter-
domain routing protocol. From their combined set of spec-
iﬁcations [15], we selected ﬁve requirements of paramount
importance, and describe the ways in which BGP fails to
meet them:
Scalability: Any future inter-domain routing protocol must
gracefully accommodate the ongoing growth of the Inter-
net. BGP fails this test, as its routing state and rate of
churn (the rate of routing announcements received by a
given router) grow linearly with the size of the network.
Since 1997 the routing table has grown from 3,000 to over
17,000 Autonomous Systems (AS’s) and from 50,000 to over
180,000 routing preﬁxes, so the issue of scaling is becoming
increasingly important.

Convergence and Route Stability: To provide reliable reach-
ability, Internet routes should be relatively stable and, when
a change is necessary, they should quickly converge to their
new steady-state. However, BGP is known to suﬀer from
signiﬁcant route instabilities, route oscillations and long con-
vergence times. Nearly 25% of BGP preﬁxes continuously
ﬂap and a large fraction of these have convergence times on
the order of hours [5]. The remaining 75% of relatively stable
preﬁxes typically take between 2 − 5 minutes to converge.
Isolation: No design can be robust and scalable if local
faults within a network can have global impact. Unfortu-
nately, BGP has very poor fault isolation properties. A
simple analysis of Routeviews BGP data [30], shows that
nearly 20% of the routing events are globally visible and
many updates observed at a router are largely a result of
events far removed from the router.
2.2 Basic Design Issues
We now contrast BGP’s approach with HLP’s along four
design issues that face any designer of inter-domain routing
protocols: routing structure, policy, routing granularity and
routing style. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but
is limited to the areas where, in our opinion, BGP is in most
need of modiﬁcation. For context, Table 1 summarizes the
primary distinctions between HLP and BGP across these
design issues.
2.2.1 Routing Structure
In order to support fully general path-based policies, BGP
reveals complete path information. As a result, local rout-
ing events can be globally visible [11]. This impairs BGP’s
scalability, and also makes it fundamentally hard to isolate
routing events [15, 11]. Moreover, the resulting interdepen-
dence between ASs makes the entire Internet vulnerable to
localized security or conﬁguration problems; a single conﬁg-
uration error or compromised router can aﬀect the rest of
the network [19].
To avoid these problems, HLP hides some path informa-
tion.
It does so by using the natural hierarchical routing
structure deﬁned by the typical relationships between inter-
connected ASs — peers, customers, and providers – and hid-
ing the small-scale routing dynamics in one hierarchy from
nodes in another hierarchy.
2.2.2 Policy
While revealing complete path information, BGP keeps
policy information private. However, this quest for pol-
icy privacy is largely futile. The vast majority of relation-
ships between ASs can be categorized as peers, customers,
or providers and, moreover, these provider-customer rela-
tionships can be accurately inferred [9, 27]. The export-rule
and route preference policy settings in nearly 99% of the
AS’s follow two simple guidelines based on these inter-AS
relationships [9, 10, 27]:
Export-rule guideline: Do not forward routes adver-
tised by one peer or a provider to another peer or provider [10]2.
Route preference guideline: Prefer customer-routes
over routes advertised by peers or providers.
While these policies dominate usage, BGP’s refusal to ex-
plicitly reveal them means that BGP is unable to distinguish
between a misconﬁgured policy and a genuine one, making
BGP much harder to manage and diagnose, and more sus-
ceptible to misconﬁgurations and attacks. Additionally, in
the absence of strict guidelines on how to set policies, policy
privacy can lead to policy conﬂicts, poor convergence and
routing instabilities [13].
HLP, in contrast, explicitly publishes the provider-customer
relationships and restricts the normal set of available paths
to a destination to those that obey the hierarchies deﬁned
by these relationships. HLP does allow policies that do not
obey these two simple rules, but it treats those as exceptions
and provides additional mechanisms for supporting them.
The result is a routing protocol that, in the common case,
can recognize misconﬁgurations and limit the propagation
of route advertisements.
2.2.3 Routing Granularity
BGP uses preﬁx-based routing. While the initial design of
BGP promoted aggregation of preﬁxes to improve scalabil-
ity, today’s usage is dominated by the opposite phenomenon
- route deaggregation for traﬃc engineering, multihoming
and policy routing. The last 4 years’ worth of BGP rout-
