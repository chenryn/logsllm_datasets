Cell vs WiFi dataset. For simplicity, in the rest of Section 3, we only
show results of downlink ﬂows from the server to the client.
3.3 TCP vs. MPTCP
A natural question pertaining to MPTCP is how the performance
of MPTCP compares with the best “single-path” TCP performance
achievable by an appropriate choice of networks alone. To answer
this, we look at all four MPTCP variants (two congestion-control
algorithms times two choices for the network used by the primary
subﬂow) and both single-path TCP variants (WiFi and LTE) as a
function of ﬂow size. Figure 7 illustrates two qualitatively different
behaviors.
Figure 7a shows a case where the performance of MPTCP is
always worse than the best single-path TCP regardless of ﬂow size.
Figure 8: CDF of relative difference between MPTCPLT E and
MPTCPWiFi, for different ﬂow sizes. The median relative differ-
ence for each ﬂow size: 60% for 10 KBytes, 49% for 100 KBytes
and 28% for 1MByte. Thus, throughput for smaller ﬂow sizes is
more affected by the choice of the network for the primary subﬂow.
This occurs in a particularly extreme scenario where a large disparity
in link speeds between the two networks (LTE and WiFi) leads to
degraded MPTCP performance irrespective of ﬂow size. On the
other hand, Figure 7b shows an alternative scenario where MPTCP
is better than the best single-path TCP at larger ﬂow sizes. In both
cases, however, picking the right network for single-path TCP is
preferable to using MPTCP for smaller ﬂows. These results suggest
that it may not always be advisable to use both networks, and an
adaptive policy that automatically picks the networks to transmit
on and the transport protocol to use would improve performance
relative to any static policy.
3.4 Primary Flow Measurement
We then study how the choice of the network for the primary sub-
ﬂow can affect MPTCP throughput for different ﬂow sizes. To show
this quantitatively, we calculate the relative throughput difference
as:

(b) MPTCP performs better than single TCP.
Figure 7: MPTCP throughput vs single path TCP throughput at 2 representative locations. Figure 7a shows a case where MPTCP throughput is
lower than the best throughput of single path TCP. Figure 7b shows a case where MPTCP throughput (in this case, MPTCP(WiFi, decoupled))
is higher than that of single-path TCP for large ﬂow sizes.
|MPTCPLT E−MPTCPWiFi|
MPTCPWiFi
.
Here, MPTCPLT E is the throughput achieved by MPTCP using
LTE for the primary subﬂow, and MPTCPWiFi is the throughput
achieved by MPTCP using WiFi for the primary subﬂow (in this
subsection, we only run MPTCP using decoupled congestion con-
trol). Figure 8 shows the CDF of the relative throughput difference
for three ﬂow sizes: 10 KBytes, 100 KBytes, and 1 MBytes. We
see that using different networks for the primary subﬂow has the
greatest effect on smaller ﬂow sizes.
3.4.1 MPTCP Throughput Evolution Over Time
To understand how using different networks for the primary sub-
ﬂow affects MPTCP throughput evolution over time, we collected
tcpdump traces at the MPTCP Client during the measurement.
From the traces, we calculate the average throughput from the time
the MPTCP session is established, to the current time t. In Figure 10
and 9, we plot the average throughput as a function of time. Each sub
ﬁgure shows the throughput of the entire MPTCP session (shown
as MPTCP) and the throughput of the individual WiFi and LTE
subﬂows.
Figure 9 shows traces collected at a location where LTE has much
higher throughput than WiFi. At time 0, the client sent the SYN
packet to the server. In Figure 9a, it took the client 1 second to
receive the SYN-ACK packet from the server over WiFi. MPTCP
throughput is the same as the throughput of the WiFi subﬂow un-
til the LTE subﬂow is established. Because LTE has much higher
throughput at this location and time, once the subﬂow is established
on LTE, it quickly increases its throughput (and therefore MPTCP’s
throughput). By contrast, in Figure 9b, the client receives the SYN-
ACK faster, and MPTCP throughput increases more quickly because
the ﬁrst subﬂow is on the higher-throughput LTE network. Because
of the smaller SYN-ACK RTT and higher throughput on the ﬁrst
primary subﬂow, the MPTCP connection using LTE for the pri-
mary subﬂow (Figure 9b) has a higher average throughput than the
MPTCP connection using WiFi for the primary subﬂow (Figure 9a).
Similarly, Figure 10 shows traces collected at a location where
WiFi has higher throughput than LTE. Here, using WiFi as the
primary subﬂow for MPTCP results in higher throughput.
3.4.2 MPTCP Throughput as a Function of Flow Size
Figures 11a and 12a show how MPTCP throughput changes as the
ﬂow size increases. The ﬂow size is measured using the cumulative
number of bytes acknowledged in each ACK packet received at the
MPTCP client. Figures 11b and 12b show the relative throughput
ratio change as ﬂow size increases. The relative throughput ratio is
deﬁned as:
MPTCPLT E
MPTCPWiFi
.
Although the absolute value of the difference in throughputs is
smaller for small ﬂow sizes (Figures 11a and 12a), the relative
throughput ratio, is larger (Figure 11b and 12b). Thus, for a connec-
tion with a given ﬂow size, using the correct interface for MPTCP
primary subﬂow can reduce the ﬂow completion time, and the rela-
tive reduction can be signiﬁcant for smaller ﬂow sizes. For example,
in Figure 11a, the absolute throughput difference between LTE and
WiFi is 0.5 mbps for a 100 KB ﬂow, and about 3 mbps for a 1 MB
ﬂow. But in Figure 11b, the relative throughput ratio is 2.2x for 100
KB ﬂow, larger than the 1.5x for a 1 MB ﬂow.
3.5 Coupled and Decoupled Congestion Control
To understand how the choice of congestion-control algorithm
within MPTCP affects its throughput, at 7 of the 20 locations, we
measured the following different MPTCP conﬁgurations on the
Verizon LTE network and each location’s dominant WiFi network:
1. LTE for primary subﬂow, coupled congestion control.
2. LTE for primary subﬂow, decoupled5 congestion control.
3. WiFi for primary subﬂow, coupled congestion control.
4. WiFi for primary subﬂow, decoupled congestion control.
At each location, we measured 10 runs for each of the 4 conﬁgu-
rations, along both the uplink and the downlink. Thus, each of the
four conﬁgurations has 140 data points ((10 + 10)× 7).
To quantify the throughput difference between conﬁgurations, we
compute:

|MPTCPLT E,coupled−MPTCPWiFi,coupled|

Here, rcwnd is the relative throughput difference when using dif-
ferent congestion-control algorithms.
Figure 13 shows the CDF of the relative throughput difference be-
tween using coupled and decoupled congestion control for three ﬂow
sizes: 10 KBytes, 100 KBytes, and 1 MByte. The rightmost CDF
curve corresponds to the relative difference for 1 MByte, while the
left-most one is for 10 KBytes. Thus, using different congestion con-
trol algorithms has a greater effect on larger ﬂow sizes. In Figure 14,
a pair-wise comparison between using different networks (labeled
with“Network”) and using different congestion control algorithms
(labeled with “CC”) for each ﬂow size shows the following:
1. For small ﬂow sizes, throughput is more affected by the choice
of network for the primary subﬂow. For example, in Fig-
ure 14a and 14b, “Network” is to the right of “CC”.
2. For large ﬂow sizes, throughput is more affected by the choice
of congestion control (decoupled or coupled) algorithms. For
example: in Figure 14c, “CC” is to the right of “Network”.
However, the choice of network for the primary subﬂow is
also important.
In practice, selecting the best network for the primary subﬂow
is more feasible than changing congestion control algorithms for
each MPTCP connection, since the primary ﬂow can be deﬁned
solely by the MPTCP endpoint initiating the connection, while the
congestion-control algorithm requires support at both endpoints.

3.6 Full-MPTCP and Backup Mode
In Sections 3.4 and 3.5, all measurements were done using Full-
MPTCP mode, since our focus was on how MPTCP’s throughput
changes under different conﬁgurations, when all paths are fully
utilized. Backup Mode is an MPTCP mode where only a subset
of paths are used to save energy, especially on power-constrained
mobile devices. In this section, we ﬁrst show how Backup Mode
differs from Full-MPTCP at the per-packet level. Then we discuss
the energy efﬁciency of both Full-MPTCP and Backup Mode.
3.6.1 Packet-Level Behavior of Full-MPTCP and Backup
Mode
Figure 15 shows the packet-transmission pattern over time for a
long ﬂow employing MPTCP, using Full-MPTCP and Backup Mode.
We use tcpdump at the MPTCP client to log packet transmission
and ack reception times. In Figure 15, we plot a vertical line at time
t if there is a packet sent or ack received at time t in the tcpdump
trace. t = 0 is the time when the ﬁrst SYN packet is sent.
Each sub-ﬁgure contains the packet-transmission patterns on both
the WiFi and LTE interfaces for one MPTCP ﬂow. Sub-ﬁgures
on the left column are packet transmission (sending and receiving)
patterns captured when using LTE for the primary subﬂow, while
sub-ﬁgures on the right are for using WiFi for the primary subﬂow.
Figures 16a and 16b show that in Full-MPTCP mode, packets are
transferred through both WiFi and LTE during the entire MPTCP
connection.
Figures 15c and 15d illustrate the backup mode where one network
is set to be the backup interface. For example, in Figure 15c, when
WiFi is set to backup, we only see the SYN and SYN ACK packets
transferred during the 3-way handshake procedure at t = 1, when the
connection establishes a WiFi subﬂow, as well as FIN and FIN-ACK
packets at t = 19, when the connection ends. A similar pattern is
shown in Figure 15d, when LTE is set to be the backup interface.
Figures 15e and 15f show packet transmissions in backup mode,
when the primary network is disabled mid-ﬂow. We disable the
interface by setting the interface to “multipath off” in iproute. In
Figure 15e, WiFi is set to backup. When the connection starts, it
