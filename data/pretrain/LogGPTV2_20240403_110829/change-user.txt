### Change User

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `change user` command modifies the installation mode for the Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) server, specifically controlling .ini file mapping.

**Note:**
For information on new features in the latest version, refer to [What's New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server](#).

**Syntax:**
```shell
change user {/execute | /install | /query}
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/execute` | Enables .ini file mapping to the user's home directory. This is the default setting. |
| `/install` | Disables .ini file mapping to the home directory. All .ini files are read and written to the system directory. Use this option when installing applications on an RDSH server. |
| `/query` | Displays the current setting for .ini file mapping. |
| `/?` | Displays help at the command prompt. |

**Remarks:**

- Use `change user /install` before installing an application to ensure that .ini files are created in the system directory. These files will serve as the source for user-specific .ini files.
- After the application is installed, use `change user /execute` to revert to standard .ini file mapping.
- When the application runs for the first time, it searches the user's home directory for its .ini files. If the .ini files are not found in the home directory but are present in the system directory, RDSH copies them to the home directory, ensuring each user has a unique copy of the .ini files. Any new .ini files are created in the home directory.
- Each user should have a unique copy of the .ini files to prevent conflicts from incompatible configurations (e.g., different default directories or screen resolutions).
- When `change user /install` is active, registry entries created by the application are shadowed under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Terminal Server\Install`. Subkeys added to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` are copied under the `\SOFTWARE` subkey, and subkeys added to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` are copied under the `\MACHINE` subkey. If the application queries the Windows directory using system calls like `GetWindowsDirectory`, the RDSH server returns the `systemroot` directory. Any .ini file entries added using system calls like `WritePrivateProfileString` are added to the .ini files under the `systemroot` directory.
- When `change user /execute` is active, if the application tries to read a registry entry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` that does not exist, RDSH checks for a copy of the key under the `\Terminal Server\Install` subkey. If found, the subkeys are copied to the appropriate location under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`. If the application tries to read from an .ini file that does not exist, RDSH searches for the .ini file under the `systemroot` directory. If the .ini file is found, it is copied to the `\Windows` subdirectory of the user's home directory. If the application queries the Windows directory, the RDSH server returns the `\Windows` subdirectory of the user's home directory.
- Upon logon, RDSH checks if the system .ini files are newer than the user's .ini files. If the system version is newer, the user's .ini file is either replaced or merged with the newer version, depending on whether the INISYNC bit (0x40) is set for that .ini file. The previous version of the .ini file is renamed to `Inifile.ctx`. If the system registry values under the `\Terminal Server\Install` subkey are newer than the user's version under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`, the user's version of the subkeys is deleted and replaced with the new subkeys from `\Terminal Server\Install`.

**Examples:**

- To disable .ini file mapping in the home directory:
  ```shell
  change user /install
  ```

- To enable .ini file mapping in the home directory:
  ```shell
  change user /execute
  ```

- To display the current setting for .ini file mapping:
  ```shell
  change user /query
  ```
