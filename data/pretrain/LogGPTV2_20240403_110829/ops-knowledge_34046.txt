### How to Detect if Full-Text Search is Installed in SQL Server

**Question:**
I need to determine whether the Full-Text Search feature is installed on SQL Server 2005. I do not have the necessary permissions to log into the server and run the Setup program to check. However, I can use SQL Server Management Studio to connect and execute queries with sysadmin permissions.

Does anyone know how to detect if this feature is installed?

**Answer:**
You can use the following T-SQL query to check if the Full-Text Search feature is installed on SQL Server 2005:

```sql
IF (1 = FULLTEXTSERVICEPROPERTY('IsFullTextInstalled'))
    PRINT 'INSTALLED'
ELSE
    PRINT 'NOT INSTALLED'
```

This query will return "INSTALLED" if the Full-Text Search feature is present, and "NOT INSTALLED" otherwise.

For more information, you can refer to the [MSDN documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-functions/fulltextserviceproperty-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15).
