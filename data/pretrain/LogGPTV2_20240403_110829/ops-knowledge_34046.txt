User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to detect if full text search is installed in SQL Server I need to find out if full text search is installed on SQL Server 2005. I don't have permission to log into the box and fire up Setup to check. However I can run SQL Server Management Studio and connect to run queries with sysadmin permissions.

Does anyone know how to detect if this feature is installed?

Assistant: IF (1 = FULLTEXTSERVICEPROPERTY('IsFullTextInstalled')) print 'INSTALLED' 
else print 'NOT INSTALLED'

(SQL Server 2005)
