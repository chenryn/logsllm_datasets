### Registering Your AS and Prefix in RIR

- **Register your AS and prefix with a Regional Internet Registry (RIR)**: While this does not have an immediate effect, it ensures that your resources are recognized. Over time, other entities may use these registered resources, making it easier to identify and resolve any issues.

### Anonymity and BGP Hijacking

- **No anonymity**: If you attempt to hijack a route, the AS-PATH will reveal your identity. This transparency makes it difficult to remain anonymous during such attacks.

- **Detection and Complaints**: If the network continues to function, it may be challenging to detect and report the hijacking. However, once identified, the process of resolution can begin.

### Resolving a BGP Hijacking

- **Identification and Action**: Once a rogue announcement is detected, immediate action is necessary. Contact upstream providers and escalate the issue. The resolution time can vary from minutes to days, depending on the size and complexity of the network.

- **Comparison to DDoS Mitigation**: Stopping a BGP hijack can be as challenging as mitigating a DDoS attack, requiring similar levels of coordination and effort.

### Implications of BGP Hijacking

- **Exploitation Potential**: Combining rootkits and zero-day vulnerabilities with BGP hijacking can enable man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. These attacks can bypass the three-way handshake and remain nearly invisible, with global reach.

- **Endpoint Enumeration**: BGP hijacking allows for direct discovery of the networks and devices that communicate with your network, providing valuable information for further attacks.

- **Global Reach**: Such attacks can be executed globally, targeting any-to-any communication.

- **Detection Challenges**: Detecting ongoing BGP hijacks, especially at events like DEFCON, can be extremely difficult due to the subtle nature of the attack.

### BGP MITM Hijack Concept

- **Route Origination**: Initiate the route as usual, using common techniques such as prefix length, shorter AS-PATH, and multiple origin points to win the routing decision.

- **Definition of "Winning"**: Winning means that most of the internet chooses your route over the legitimate one.

- **Packet Return Path**: Coordinating the return path for packets can be complex. Using the internet itself as the reply path simplifies this, but requires careful planning.

### BGP MITM Setup

1. **Traceroute and Plan Reply Path**: Use traceroute to map the path to the target and plan the reply path.
2. **Identify ASNâ€™s**: Note the ASNs seen towards the target from the traceroute and BGP table.
3. **AS-PATH Prepend**: Apply AS-PATH prepends to include each of the ASNs intended for the reply path.
4. **Static Routes**: Set up static routes towards the next-hop of the first AS in the reply path.
5. **Completion**: Verify the setup and ensure the routes are correctly configured.

### BGP MITM Example

- **Initial Convergence**: The target ASN 200 originates the route 10.10.220.0/22 and sends announcements to AS20 and AS30. The internet converges towards the valid route.
- **FIB View**: The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) shows the converged route.
- **Reply Path Planning**: The attacker ASN 100 builds an AS-PATH prepend list including AS 10, 20, and 200.
- **Route Announcement**: Announce 10.10.220.0/24 with a route-map that includes the AS-PATH prepends.
- **Static Route Installation**: Install a static route in AS100 for 10.10.220.0/24 to AS10's link.

### Anonymizing the Hijacker

- **TTL Adjustment**: Adjust the Time to Live (TTL) of packets in transit to hide the IP devices handling the hijacked inbound traffic and the outbound networks towards the target.
- **Effect**: The presence of the hijacker remains hidden, making detection more difficult.

### Traceroute Comparison

- **Without TTL Adjustment**: The traceroute reveals the full path, including all intermediate hops.
- **With TTL Adjustment**: The traceroute shows a modified path, hiding the actual route and making it harder to trace the hijacker.

### Conclusion

- **Arbitrary Prefix Hijacking**: Any prefix can be hijacked without breaking end-to-end connectivity.
- **Invisibility**: BGP hijacks can occur nearly invisibly, making them hard to detect.
- **Revealing the Attacker**: The BGP AS-PATH can reveal the identity of the attacker.
- **Prevention**: Implement strong filtering and security measures to protect your network and customers.
