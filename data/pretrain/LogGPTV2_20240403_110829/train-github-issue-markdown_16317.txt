### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
I would like to request the integration of Thinkorswim windows with FancyZones. This enhancement will allow users to better organize and manage their Thinkorswim application windows within the FancyZones workspace.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
To achieve this, the following steps could be considered:

1. **Window Detection**: Enhance the window detection mechanism in FancyZones to recognize Thinkorswim windows.
2. **Integration**: Ensure that Thinkorswim windows are fully compatible with all FancyZones features, such as snapping, resizing, and custom zone layouts.
3. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the integration is stable and does not introduce any performance issues or conflicts with other applications.

Thank you for your help in making this feature a reality!
