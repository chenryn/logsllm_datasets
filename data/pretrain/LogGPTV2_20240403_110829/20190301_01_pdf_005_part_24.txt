The result of IN is TRUE if any equal subquery row is found. The result is FALSE if no
equal row is found (including the special case where the subquery returns no rows).
expression IN (subquery)
Note that if the left-hand expression yields NULL, or if there are no equal right-hand
values and at least one right-hand row yields NULL, the result of the IN construct will be
NULL, not FALSE. This is in accordance with SQL‟s normal rules for Boolean
combinations of null values.
As with EXISTS, it‟s unwise to assume that the subquery will be evaluated completely.
2.4.12.3 NOT IN
The right-hand side is a parenthesized subquery, which must return exactly one column.
The left-hand expression is evaluated and compared to each row of the subquery result.
The result of NOT IN is TRUE if only unequal subquery rows are found (including the
special case where the subquery returns no rows). The result is FALSE if any equal row is
found.
expression NOT IN (subquery)
Note that if the left-hand expression yields NULL, or if there are no equal right-hand
values and at least one right-hand row yields NULL, the result of the NOT IN construct
will be NULL, not TRUE. This is in accordance with SQL‟s normal rules for Boolean
combinations of null values.
As with EXISTS, it‟s unwise to assume that the subquery will be evaluated completely.
2.4.12.4 ANY/SOME
The right-hand side is a parenthesized subquery, which must return exactly one column.
The left-hand expression is evaluated and compared to each row of the subquery result
using the given operator, which must yield a Boolean result. The result of ANY is TRUE if
any true result is obtained. The result is FALSE if no true result is found (including the
special case where the subquery returns no rows).
expression operator ANY (subquery)
expression operator SOME (subquery)
SOME is a synonym for ANY. IN is equivalent to = ANY.

Note that if there are no successes and at least one right-hand row yields NULL for the
operator‟s result, the result of the ANY construct will be NULL, not FALSE. This is in
accordance with SQL‟s normal rules for Boolean combinations of null values.
As with EXISTS, it‟s unwise to assume that the subquery will be evaluated completely.
2.4.12.5 ALL
The right-hand side is a parenthesized subquery, which must return exactly one column.
The left-hand expression is evaluated and compared to each row of the subquery result
using the given operator, which must yield a Boolean result. The result of ALL is TRUE if
all rows yield true (including the special case where the subquery returns no rows). The
result is FALSE if any false result is found. The result is NULL if the comparison does not
return FALSE for any row, and it returns NULL for at least one row.
expression operator ALL (subquery)
NOT IN is equivalent to <> ALL. As with EXISTS, it‟s unwise to assume that the
subquery will be evaluated completely.
