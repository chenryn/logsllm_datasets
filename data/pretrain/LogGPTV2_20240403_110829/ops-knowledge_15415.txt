User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Someone is using my (or has the same) email I just got a letter from court saying I made 49 threats to someone I had a problem with three years ago. This person presents "my emails" as evidence. I went through all my emails, and I haven't found a single one. The mail presented as evidence all come from my email address. He asks for 20,000 dollars for moral damage! 
How can this happen?

(ed. The letter is a valid and official legal document in accordance with the normal procedures in the country of Portugal. OP has already engaged with a lawyer. The accuser is a known scam artist. This question is about the technical details of the emails.)

Assistant: Is it a scam?
First of all, make sure that you actually got the letter from a court. This might very well be a scam - it sure sounds like one. Do this to verify that the letter is real:

Make sure that the name of the court correspond to a real court.
Find contact information to that court through some independent method (i.e. not using any information in the letter).
Contact them and ask them if they did in fact send the letter.

If it is not a scam
If it is not a scam, I see three possibilities:

The person accusing you of the threats never received the emails, and have forged the evidence. That would not be hard to do. (An investigation of the email headers will not help here, since they can also be forged.)
Someone has spoofed your email address, and has sent emails that appear to come from you. This is by no means impossible. (An investigation of the email headers could be useful here.)
Someone has hacked your email account (perhaps you used the same password on a site that was breached), sent the emails, and then deleted all traces (e.g. removed them from the sent items folder). (An investigation of the email headers would not help here, since the email is in fact sent from your address. Access logs from your email provider could prove useful, though.)

If it's not a scam, what you need to do in any case is to get some legal advice.
