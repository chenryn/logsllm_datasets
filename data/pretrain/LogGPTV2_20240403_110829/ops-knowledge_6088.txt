User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题GoDaddy: exim4 receiving emails but fails to send on "No route to host" error On an Ubuntu 16.04 VPS, hosted by GoDaddy, I want to be able to send email using my domain name.

I created a mail user noreply@webtest.domain.com through Vestacp, installed Roundcube and checked that I could receive emails from one of my personal addresses (tried with gmail and hotmail).

However when I want to reply, exim4 fails to send, and gives me a "No route to host" error.

# cat /var/log/exim4/mainlog

I tried to run tracepath to one of those ip, and I could see that by default it was taking the GoDaddy inner network's interface, and not the one with the Internet IP:

# tracepath 172.217.218.27
 1?: [LOCALHOST]                                         pmtu 1500
 1:  10.217.15.252                                         0.262ms
[...]

 9:  no reply
10:  no reply


I therefore tried to add the interface directive in /etc/exim4/conf.d/transport/30_exim4-config_remote_smtp, and rebooted the VPS.

remote_smtp:
  debug_print = "T: remote_smtp for $local_part@$domain"
  driver = smtp
  interface = 148.72.xx.xx


But I am still getting the same error. I have no idea where to look now.

Assistant: The issue wasn't where I was expecting it to be, it was "simply" the provider GoDaddy requiring me to use their relay server. I understood that by testing the port 25 with $ telnet portquiz.net 25, and to my great surprise, even-though there wasn't any connection on it, or firewall blocking it, it couldn't connect.

The fix:

This will make your mails go through GoDaddy's mail servers, but it's the simplest solution afaik. I edited the config template file /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template, and updated the following section to have this:

######################################################################
#                      ROUTERS CONFIGURATION                         #
#               Specifies how addresses are handled                  #
######################################################################
begin routers

smarthost:
  driver = manualroute
  transport = remote_smtp
  route_list = !+local_domains dedrelay.secureserver.net


Then I ran # dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config again (I am not sure if the configuration I entered then is the only one that works, but it works for me):

- Internet site;
- System mail name: xxx.secureserver.net (find yours in GoDaddy's My Hosting &gt; Server &gt; YourVPS &gt; Settings tab &gt; Hostname)
- 127.0.0.1 ; ::1
- mydomain.com
- Domain to relay: empty
- Machines to relay: empty
- DNS dial on demand: no
- mbox
- Split config: no


And of course, as you probably have seen it a thousand times on the internet, you can test the configuration with:

echo "hello" | mail -s "Title" recipient@mail.com


However, it may take about 5min for the email to be delivered. A faster way to know if the email is properly being processed is to check if the "SMTP relays" counter is being incremented, in your server's dashboard, on GoDaddy's website.
