I have a Kafka producer associated with a client ID "p1" and a quota of 50 MBps. I tested the performance of this producer using the `bin/kafka-producer-perf-test.sh` script and observed a throughput close to 50 MBps when writing to a partition without any replicas.

However, when I conducted the same experiment on a partition with three replicas, the throughput dropped to approximately 30 MBps. My question is: shouldn't Kafka still allow the producer to achieve a throughput of 50 MBps even in the presence of replicas? There are no other processes running on the system, so I am unsure why this reduction in throughput is occurring.

**Response:**

It sounds like the `acks` configuration for your Kafka producer might be set to `all`, which means the producer waits for all replicas to acknowledge the write before considering the message as successfully sent. This can significantly impact the throughput, especially when there are multiple replicas involved.

To test if this is the cause of the reduced throughput, you can try setting the `acks` configuration to `0`. This will make the producer not wait for any acknowledgment from the server, potentially increasing the throughput. However, please note that setting `acks` to `0` reduces the reliability of the message delivery, as the producer will not know if the message was actually written to the log.

Hereâ€™s how you can set the `acks` configuration in your producer properties:

```properties
acks=0
```

After making this change, re-run your performance test and observe the throughput. If the throughput increases, it confirms that the acknowledgment settings were the cause of the reduced performance.
