To make sure that Flutter can always bring up the keyboard I made the window
of virtual display's presentation non focusable.  
As a result the embedded Android views cannot bring up the keyboard.
We should figure out if there's some window trickery we can do to let the
unfocused window bring up the keyboard. Alternatively see if it's possible to
dynamically select the focused window when delivering input events.
