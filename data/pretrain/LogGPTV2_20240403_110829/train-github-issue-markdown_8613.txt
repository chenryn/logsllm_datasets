To ensure that Flutter can consistently bring up the keyboard, I set the window of the virtual display's presentation to be non-focusable. As a result, embedded Android views are unable to trigger the keyboard.

We need to investigate whether there are any window management techniques that would allow the unfocused window to bring up the keyboard. Alternatively, we should explore the possibility of dynamically selecting the focused window when delivering input events.
