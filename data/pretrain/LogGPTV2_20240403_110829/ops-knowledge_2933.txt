**User:** I have PostgreSQL installed (using the PostgreSQL app). When I attempt to run `pip install psycopg2`, I receive the error: "unable to execute gcc-4.2: No such file or directory." How can I resolve this issue?

**Assistant:** Instead of using `pip install psycopg2`, try installing the pre-compiled binary version with the following command:

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

This should resolve the issue, as `psycopg2-binary` includes the necessary C extensions and does not require a C compiler.
