I am currently using GDB 7.4 on a Windows 7 machine. When I attempt to execute a Python script, I receive the following error message: "Python scripting is not supported in this version of GDB." I was under the impression that Python scripting was supported in GDB 7.4. 

Could you please guide me on where I can find a version of GDB that supports Python for Windows?

**Response:**

To use a version of GDB with Python scripting enabled on Windows, you will need to install a specific package. In the MinGW installer, look for and install the `mingw32-gdb-python` package. This package includes GDB compiled with Python support.
