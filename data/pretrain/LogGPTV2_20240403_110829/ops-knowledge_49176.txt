User: I am using gdb 7.4 on a windows 7 machine
When I attempt to execute python script I get 
"Python scripting is not supported in this version of GDB"
I thought that it was supported in 7.4?
Where can I get a version of gdb that is python enabled for windows?
Assistant: In mingw installer you need to install a special package called mingw32-gdb-python.
Which is the gdb compiled with python enabled
