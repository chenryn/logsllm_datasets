### 4.1.2 Account Quality
The quality of the accounts appears to be reflected in the high ratings (out of 10) achieved by the workers responsible for the PK3, ID3, and most notably, CA1 account sets.

### 4.1.3 CAPTCHA Solving
To maintain a low barrier to participation, creating an account on most online services today typically requires little more than solving a CAPTCHA. Designed to be difficult for algorithms to solve, CAPTCHAs serve as a deterrent to automated abuse. In response to their widespread deployment, human-based CAPTCHA-solving services have emerged within the abuse ecosystem. These services rely on cheap human labor to provide a simple programmatic interface for solving CAPTCHAs, thereby enabling otherwise fully automated abuse processes.

In a previous study [12], we described a robust retail CAPTCHA-solving industry capable of solving up to a million CAPTCHAs per day at a rate of $1 per 1,000 solved. Consequently, CAPTCHAs now represent a minor economic obstacle to abusers, forming the first step in the account value chain.

CAPTCHAs are well-suited to the Freelancer outsourcing paradigm, and the Freelancer marketplace has played a significant role in the evolution of CAPTCHA solving. Figure 2 illustrates the history of prices offered for CAPTCHA solving, along with the demand (in number of job offers per month) since 2007. The data shows a rise in demand from their first appearance, accompanied by a corresponding drop in prices to the current rate of $1 per 1,000 solves, corroborating our previous findings [12].

### 4.1.4 Account Verification
Creating a basic account, even one that requires solving a CAPTCHA, is relatively inexpensive. To combat online abuse, services must leverage limited resources available to users. To increase the capabilities of a basic account, users often need to undergo account verification, which can take various forms, such as providing a phone number or credit card. Verification enhances the user's standing within the service, granting greater access and increasing the account's value. Therefore, verification is a critical step in the value chain of many abuse processes.

Phone verification is the most common type of verified account. Beyond the steps required to create a basic account, phone-verified accounts (PVAs) require a working phone number as an additional validation factor. Services will either call or message a code to the number, which the user must then submit back to the service to complete authorization. For some services, phone verification is mandatory (e.g., posting advertisements in certain Craigslist forums, creating multiple Gmail accounts from the same IP address), while for others, it adds convenience (e.g., avoiding CAPTCHAs on Facebook). Services typically require the phone number to be associated with a landline or mobile phone, as VoIP numbers are easier to scale for abuse. Phone verification is effective: immediately after Gmail introduced phone verification to limit account abuse, the prices for Gmail accounts on underground forums increased tenfold [2]. However, PVAs add further delay and inconvenience to users, which is why services do not uniformly use phone verification.

### 4.1.5 Web Services Targeted
Figure 3 displays the distribution of services targeted in job postings for both basic and verified account registrations. For ease of comparison, it shows the top 10 targeted services combined. If a job targets multiple services, it is counted in the total for each service mentioned. Job postings target accounts across every major category of internet service, including web mail, social networks, financial services, and marketplaces. However, the distribution of specific services differs significantly between the two types of account registration jobs, reflecting how services vary in their deployment of additional verification mechanisms. Basic accounts are useful for various purposes, such as obtaining accounts for other internet services (Facebook, Craigslist, etc.), with Gmail being the most popular. For verified accounts, Craigslist is the dominant target, likely because all sections of Craigslist targeted by spammers require PVAs.

We posted a job on Freelancer.com soliciting bids for "Craigslist Phone Verified Accounts (PVA)." Of the 10 bids received, 4 contained prices: $3, $4, $4.50, and $6. These prices are consistent with the current observed buyer offers for Craigslist PVAs. The pricing of PVAs indicates the monetary value of phone verification as a security mechanism. For Craigslist, PVAs have made account abuse extremely expensive. In contrast, retail services sell Gmail PVAs for around 25¢, a 10–20 fold price difference compared to Craigslist.

### 4.1.6 Trends
Demand for accounts through Freelancer grew dramatically starting in mid-2008. Figure 4 shows the number of account creation jobs posted over time. Demand for basic accounts steadily increased through mid-2008, then surged until it peaked in mid-2009. Demand for verified accounts rose significantly when Craigslist introduced phone verification for the erotic services section in early March 2008 [4]. Demand grew steadily until about October 2009, then dropped. We extracted prices from the Craigslist postings and observed that Craigslist PVAs initially rose to $4 by the end of 2008 and then settled around $2. In October 2009, prices spiked to more than $5, then fluctuated between $2 and $3 through 2010.

For both types of accounts—basic and verified—demand dropped during 2010. The cause is unknown, but we suspect it may be due to stricter policing by Freelancer.com; our own price solicitation for Craigslist posting was canceled by the site.

### 4.2 OSN Linking
Online social networking (OSN) links can be abused in two ways: (1) as a communication channel to market to real users, which is a finished product ready for direct monetization; (2) as an intermediate product to enhance the reputation—and thus influence—of accounts by adding social links to other fake accounts. Previous research has shown that OSN spam has a higher click-through rate than traditional email-based spam [7]. Thus, OSN platforms have become a lucrative marketing venue where spammers exploit the trust relationships in social networks to improve conversion rates. However, it is challenging for spammers to contact users on a social networking site until they have established a social link with real users. These social links take various forms, depending on the targeted social networking site, such as convincing a user to friend the spammer, follow a spammer’s Twitter feed, become a fan of the spammer’s page, or subscribe to the spammer’s YouTube channel. Building social links to real users is similar to gathering email addresses for later monetization via email spamming. Once the social link is established, the spammer has a highly reliable communication channel that is not subject to aggressive filtering.

### 4.2.1 Characterization
There are two main categories of social networking links requested in jobs. The first are friendship relationships (e.g., MySpace and Facebook friends), where an active invitation is offered, and if accepted, targeted messages can be delivered to a user’s private inbox. The second are subscription relationships (e.g., Facebook fans, Twitter followers, YouTube subscribers) where, if a user is induced to follow a spammer’s account, messages will appear in the user’s feed. Depending on the site, the relationship also grants the ability to send private messages to the user. A related goal is to use social links to increase the perceived popularity of an object, such as increasing the view count of YouTube videos or digging links on Digg. We group all these jobs into the category of social network links, as they all aim to increase the reputation of an account or object or establish a marketing channel to real users.

Jobs for bulk social link building range from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of links. Typically, jobs interested in acquiring fake social links will request a relatively small number of links spread out over a large number of accounts (e.g., add 500 friends to 50 accounts). Requests for social links to real users often specify a target demographic, exploiting the same targeted marketing potential that legitimate advertisers use to improve ad targeting. For example, a job might require that most social links be to male accounts in the US over the age of 18. The most targeted geographic demographics are high-income English-speaking countries, including the US (46%), UK (13.2%), Canada (9.5%), and Australia (6.2%). Additionally, based on keyword searches, females are specifically targeted in 8% of jobs, and males in 3% of the jobs.

### 4.2.2 Trends
Figure 5 shows the demand over time for job postings for social networking links. Overall demand for social links has skyrocketed since the early part of 2010, suggesting that spammers have only recently realized the potential for monetizing social links. The social networking sites with the largest English-speaking user bases (Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and YouTube) are targeted by 97% of the job postings for social links. Over 50% of social link jobs included words such as “real” and “active,” indicating that they were seeking to buy a more finished type of social link that could be directly spammed. This percentage is a lower bound, as it is unclear how many postings did not include these types of words but were actually seeking real social links.

Overall, the median offered price in posts was $0.01 per social link, and median bids were between $0.02–$0.03 per social link. These prices were similar across all social networking sites. This low price point raises the question of whether proposed defenses that mitigate Sybil attacks via analysis of social link structure [14, 15] might be vulnerable to adversaries willing to hire humans to create real social links.

### 4.2.3 Experiences Purchasing Social Links
In preparation for purchasing social links, we instantiated several websites on the topic of cosmetics consulting [16] and created separate “pages” about each site on a popular social networking service. We then commissioned a job to obtain one thousand social links for these pages, explicitly targeting users from the US, Canada, and the UK. We assigned the task to 10 different workers, each given a different website to target. Table 6 shows the results of this task. The names of the sets correspond to the selected workers’ home countries, and the links column is the maximum reported daily number of social links. Most of the workers delivered the required number of social links in a timely manner (except for the BD7 set); however, the quality of the social links was generally poor. Most workers did not deliver social links from users that met our specifications, particularly regarding user countries. Several workers added social links at a rapid pace, with some jobs being completed in as few as two days. We observed substantial overlap between the users linked to our target pages, as shown in Figure 6. As many as 50% of the users (between IN4 and BD4, for example) overlapped. This suggests that the workers are manipulating the same set of users to produce these social links, or subcontracting the task to the same groups of workers. Only one worker, responsible for MY1, had no overlap with any of the other sites. The selected worker ratings do not reflect the quality of the delivered products, indicating that buyers who hire these workers find it difficult to evaluate social link quality.

Next, we extracted the profiles for the OSN users linked to our target websites and looked at the number of friends and page links listed on their profiles. Figure 7 shows a scatterplot of the median number of friends versus the median number of page links for these OSN users. Several clusters emerge in the graph. Within each user batch, we manually visited the profiles of those users; only one worker, MY1, appears to have delivered social links from legitimate users. The rest used predominantly fake accounts, many of which had few friends and a large number (>1,000) of page social links.

### 4.3 Spamming
In our study, we define spamming as the dissemination of an advertiser’s message to users through means other than established advertising networks. Spamming provides the buyer with a direct marketing channel to their targets and represents one of the most finished commodities in the advertising value chain [6].

In our survey and classifier-based labeling (Tables 2 and 3), the class of spamming jobs includes ad posting and bulk mailing. Since Craigslist is the main target of ad posting jobs (82%), we treat it separately. We begin by analyzing the pricing data for bulk mailing.

### 4.3.1 Bulk Mailing
Bulk mailing is essentially traditional email spam and represents 0.3–0.4% of all jobs posted on Freelancer.com. In most cases, buyers supply their own mailing lists, although some, generally targeting larger volumes, expect bidders to supply their own address lists.
