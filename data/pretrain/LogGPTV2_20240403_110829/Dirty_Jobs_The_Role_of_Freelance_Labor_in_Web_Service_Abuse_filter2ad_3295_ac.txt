seem to reﬂect the quality of the accounts, as demon-
strated by the high ratings (out of 10) achieved by those
workers responsible for the PK3, ID3, and most notably,
CA1 account sets.
4.1.3 CAPTCHA Solving
To keep the barrier to participation extremely low, cre-
ating an account at an online service today requires lit-
tle more than solving a CAPTCHA. CAPTCHAs are de-
signed to be hard to solve algorithmically, and thus create
an obstacle to automating service abuse. In response to
their widespread deployment, human-based CAPTCHA-
solving services emerged in abuse ecosystem. Such ser-
vices depend on cheap human labor to provide a sim-
ple programmatic interface for solving CAPTCHAs to an
otherwise completely automated abuse processes chain.
In a previous study [12], we described a robust retail
CAPTCHA-solving industry capable of solving a million
CAPTCHAs a day at $1 per 1,000 solved. Thus today,
CAPTCHAs are neither more nor less than a small eco-
nomic impediment to the abuser, forming the ﬁrst step in
the account value chain.
By their nature, CAPTCHAs are ideally suited to the
Freelancer outsourcing paradigm, and indeed the Free-
lancer marketplace has played a key role in the evolu-
tion of CAPTCHA solving. Figure 2 shows the history of
prices offered for CAPTCHA solving as well the demand
(in number of job offers per month) since 2007. We see
a rise in demand starting from their ﬁrst appearance, and
a corresponding drop in prices to the $1 per 1,000 price

seen today, corroborating our previous ﬁndings [12].
4.1.4 Account Veriﬁcation
Because creating a basic account—even one requiring
solving a CAPTCHA—is so cheap, to curb online abuse
services must necessarily take advantage of some limited
resource available to a user. To increase the limits placed
on a basic account, a user must sometimes undergo ac-
count veriﬁcation, which takes a variety of forms (e.g.
phone numbers, credit cards, etc.). Veriﬁcation increases
the user’s standing within the service, giving the account
holder greater access to the service and thereby increas-
ing the value of the account. For this reason, veriﬁcation
is a step in the value chain of many abuse processes.
The most popular type of veriﬁed account uses phone
veriﬁcation. Beyond the steps for creating a basic ac-
count, phone-veriﬁed accounts (PVAs) require a work-
ing phone number as an additional validation factor in
account authorization. Services will either call or mes-
sage a code to the number, and the user must submit
the number back to the service to complete authoriza-
tion. For some services phone veriﬁcation is mandatory
(e.g., for posting advertisements in certain forums on
Craigslist, creating multiple accounts in Gmail from the
same IP address), and for other services, phone veriﬁ-
cation adds convenience (e.g., avoids CAPTCHAs with
Facebook). Services typically require the phone number
to be associated with a landline or mobile phone since,
unlike VoIP phone numbers, it is much more difﬁcult
to scale the abuse of such numbers. Phone veriﬁcation
is effective: immediately after Gmail introduced phone
veriﬁcation to limit account abuse, for instance, prices
for Gmail accounts on underground forums skyrocketed
to 10 times other Web-mail accounts [2]. However, even
more so than CAPTCHAs, PVAs add further delay and
inconvenience to users and is the primary reason why ser-
vices do not use phone veriﬁcation uniformly.
4.1.5 Web Services Targeted
Figure 3 shows the distribution of services targeted in job
postings for basic and veriﬁed account registrations. For
ease of comparison, it shows the top 10 targeted services
Figure 4: Demand for account registration jobs over time.
The dashed vertical lines indicate approximate dates when

(March 2008) and other services (May 2008).
for both kinds of accounts, combined. For a job targeting
multiple services, we count it in the total for each service
mentioned. Job postings target accounts in every major
category of Internet service: Web mail, social networks,
as well ﬁnancial and marketplace services. However the
distribution of speciﬁc services differ markedly between
the two types of account registration jobs, reﬂecting how
services vary in their deployment of additional veriﬁ-
cation mechanisms (if any). Basic accounts are useful
for many purposes, including obtaining accounts up for
other Internet services (Facebook, Craigslist, etc.), and
Gmail is by far the most popular. When it comes to veri-
ﬁed accounts, on the other hand, Craigslist is the dom-
inant target, most certainly because Craigslist sections
targeted by spammers all require PVAs.
We posted a job soliciting bids for “CraigsList Phone
Veriﬁed Accounts PVA” on Freelancer.com. Of the 10
bids we received, 4 contained prices: $3, $4, $4.50, and
$6. These prices are consistent with the currently ob-
served buyer offers for Craigslist PVAs. The pricing of
PVAs tells us in monetary terms the value of phone ver-
iﬁcation as a security mechanism. For Craigslist, PVAs
have made account abuse extremely expensive. In con-
trast, retail services sell Gmail PVAs for around 25¢, a
10–20 fold price difference compared to Craigslist.
4.1.6 Trends
Demand for accounts through Freelancer grew dramati-
cally starting mid-2008. Figure 4 shows the number of
account creation jobs posted over time. Demand for ba-
sic accounts steadily increased through mid-2008, then
dramatically increased until it peaked in mid-2009.
Demand for veriﬁed accounts rose greatly when
Craigslist introduced phone veriﬁcation for the erotic ser-
vices section of their site in early March 2008 [4]. De-
mand grew steadily until about October 2009, and then
dropped. We extracted prices from the Craigslist post-
ings, and observed that Craigslist PVAs ﬁrst rose to $4
by the end of 2008 and then settled around $2. In Octo-

between $2 and $3 through 2010.
For both types of accounts—basic and veriﬁed—
demand dropped during 2010. We do not know the cause;
however we suspect this may be due to stricter policing
on behalf of Freelancer.com; our own price solicitation
for Craigslist posting was canceled by the site.
4.2 OSN Linking
Online social networking links can be abused in two
ways: (1) as a communication channel to market to
real users, which is a ﬁnished product ready to directly
monetize; (2) as an intermediate product to increase the
reputation—and thus inﬂuence—of accounts by adding
social links to other fake accounts. Previous work has
shown that online social networking spam has a higher
click-through rate than traditional email-based spam [7].
Thus, OSN platforms have emerged as a lucrative mar-
keting venue where spammers are exploiting the trust re-
lationships that exist in social networks to improve their
conversion rates. However, it is difﬁcult for a spammer
to contact users on a social networking site until they
have established a social link with real users. These so-
cial links take many different forms, depending on the
targeted social networking site, such as convincing a user
to friend the spammer, follow a spammer’s Twitter feed,
become a fan of the spammer’s page, or subscribe to
the spammer’s YouTube channel. Building social links
to real users is analogous to gathering email addresses
that will later by monetized with email spamming. Once
this social link is established, the spammer has a com-
munication channel that is both highly reliable and not
subject to aggressive ﬁltering.
for buying both real and fake bulk social links.
4.2.1 Characterization
There are two main categories of social networking links
requested in jobs. The ﬁrst are friendship relationships
(e.g., MySpace and Facebook friends), where an active
invitation is offered and, if accepted, targeted messages
can then be delivered to a user’s private inbox. The sec-
ond are subscription relationships (e.g., Facebook fans,
Twitter followers, YouTube subscribers) where, if a user
Adding fake social links is a relatively inexpensive
method for increasing the reputation of an account,
which in turn presumably improves the success rate of
establishing links to real users. This method is effective
because people are more willing to establish or accept
social links that are more popular in terms of the number
of previously-established social links or other endorse-
ments. If the account has many social links and, more
importantly, if mutual social links exist, the likelihood
increases that the targeted real user will establish or ac-
cept a social link with the spammer.
In this section we survey the Freelancer.com market

can be induced to follow a spammer’s account, messages
will appear in a user’s feed; depending on the site, the re-
lationship also grants the ability to send private messages
to the user. A closely related goal is to use social links
to increase the perceived popularity of an object. Exam-
ples of this type of task are increasing the view count of
YouTube videos, or digging links on Digg. We group all
these jobs into the category of social network links and
they all follow the form of increasing the reputation of
an account/object or establishing a marketing channel to
real users.
Jobs for bulk social link building range from a few
hundred to hundreds of thousands of links. Typically
jobs interested in acquiring fake social links will re-
quest a relatively small number of links spread out over a
large number of accounts (e.g., add 500 friends to 50 ac-
counts). The requests for social links to real users often
specify a target demographic for the links, thereby ex-
ploiting the same targeted marketing potential of using
information included in a proﬁle that legitimate advertis-
ers on these sites also use to improve ad targeting. For
example, a job might require that most social links be to
male accounts in the US over the age of 18. The most tar-
geted geographic demographics are high-income English
speaking countries including the US (46%), UK (13.2%),
Canada (9.5%) and Australia (6.2%). Also, based on key-
word searches, females are speciﬁcally targeted in 8% of
jobs and males in 3% of the jobs.
4.2.2 Trends
Figure 5 shows the demand over time for job postings for
social networking links. Overall demand for social links
has skyrocketed since the early part of 2010, suggesting
that spammers have only recently realized the potential
for monetizing social links. The social networking sites
with the largest English-speaking user bases (Facebook,
MySpace, Twitter, and YouTube) are targeted by 97% of
the job postings for social links. Over 50% of social link
jobs included words such as “real” and “active” indicat-
ing that they were seeking to buy a more ﬁnished type of
social link that could be directly spammed. This percent-
age is a lower bound, however, as it is unclear how many

postings did not include these types of words but were
actually seeking real social links.
Overall the median offered price in posts were $0.01
per social link, and median bids were between $0.02–
0.03 per a social link. These prices were similar across
all of the social networking sites. This low price point
raises the interesting question of whether proposed de-
fenses that mitigate Sybil attacks via analysis of social
link structure [14, 15] might be vulnerable to adversaries
that are willing to simply hire humans to create real so-
cial links.
4.2.3 Experiences Purchasing Social Links
In preparation for purchasing social links, we instanti-
ated several Web sites on the topic of cosmetics consult-
ing [16] and created separate “pages” about each site on
a popular social networking service. We then commis-
sioned a job to obtain one thousand social links for these
pages. The posted job explicitly targeted users from the
US, Canada, and the UK. We assigned the task to 10 dif-
ferent workers, each given a different Web site to target.
Table 6 shows the results of this task. The name of
the sets correspond to the selected workers’ home coun-
tries, and the links column is the maximum reported daily
number of social links. Most of the workers delivered
the required number of social links in a timely manner
(except for the BD7 set); the quality of the social links,
however, was quite poor. Most of the workers did not de-
liver social links from users that met our speciﬁcations,
particularly in regards to user countries. Also, several of
the workers added social links at a rapid pace, with some
jobs being completed in as few as two days. Next, we ob-
served substantial overlap between the users linked to our
target pages, shown in Figure 6. As many as 50% of the
Figure 6: The number of user accounts common to each pair of
workers hired to create social links. Labeled solid lines indicate
at least 100 user accounts (out of 1,000 requested) in common,
dashed lines indicate at least 10 but fewer than 100 user ac-
counts in common. Work performed by MY1, PK4, and BD2 was
done in April, while the remaining jobs were done roughly a
month later.

users (between IN4 and BD4, for example) overlapped.
This overall suggests that the workers are all manipulat-
ing the same set of users to produce these social links,
or even perhaps subcontracting out the task to the same
groups of workers. Only one worker, responsible for MY1,
had no overlap with any of the other sites. Again, the
selected worker ratings do not reﬂect the quality of the
delivered products; we posit that buyers who hire these
workers ﬁnd it difﬁcult to evaluate social link quality.
Next, we extracted the proﬁles for the OSN users who
were linked to our target Web sites, and looked at the
number of friends and page links listed on their proﬁles.
Figure 7 shows a scatterplot of the median number of
friends versus the median number of page links for these
OSN users. Several clusters emerge in the graph. Within
each user batch, we manually visited the proﬁles of those
users; only one worker, MY1, appears to have delivered
social links from legitimate users. The rest used predom-
inately fake accounts, many of which had few friends and
a large number (>1,000) of page social links.
4.3 Spamming
In our study, we consider spamming to be the dissemina-
tion of an advertiser’s message to users by means other
than established advertising networks. Spamming pro-
vides the buyer with a direct marketing channel to his

commodities in the advertising value chain.6
In our survey and classiﬁer-based labeling (Tables 2
and 3), the class of spamming jobs is comprised of ad
posting and bulk mailing.7 Because Craigslist is the main
target of ad posting jobs (82%), we treat it separately. We
begin by ﬁrst analyzing the pricing data for bulk mailing.
4.3.1 Bulk Mailing
Bulk mailing is simply traditional email spam and rep-
resents 0.3–0.4% of all jobs posted on Freelancer.com.
In most cases, the buyers supply their own mailing lists,
although some—generally targeting larger volumes—
expect bidders to supply their own address lists.
