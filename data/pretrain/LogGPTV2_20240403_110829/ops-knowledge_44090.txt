User: Apart from Apache web server is there any open source web servers available for web application development? 
I am looking for a web server developing python web applications and deploy it and test it.
Assistant: If you simply Google "Open Source Web Server" you'll get a lot of results.

Nginx
Lighttpd
Cherokee
Savant
Tornado

Nginx is probably the best alternative.
