Challenge Waypoint: Line up Form Elements Responsively with Bootstrap
The padding or margins around text in this challenge causes several issues.
  * The text is not properly centered in the Like, Info, and Delete buttons in earlier parts of the waypoint before the FA icons are added
  * The "delete" text runs off only showing "dele"
  * The "loving" text overflows onto the next line
