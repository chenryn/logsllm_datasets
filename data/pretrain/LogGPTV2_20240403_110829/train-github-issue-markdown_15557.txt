Good morning,

I recently updated Matplotlib and encountered an error (possibly a typo) in the plot GUI. When using the "Save the figure" button, I receive the following error message for every supported format:

```
Format "png))" is not supported.
```

This issue occurs regardless of the file format selected (e.g., replacing `png` with `jpg`, `pdf`, etc.).

Here is a minimal working example to reproduce the issue:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
plt.plot(a[:, 0], a[:, 1], '*')
plt.show()
```

System Specifications:
- OS: Arch Linux (Kernel 3.16.1-1-ARCH)
- Matplotlib version: 1.4.0 (installed via AUR)

Thank you in advance for your help!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
