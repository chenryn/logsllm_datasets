ance and blacklist incompleteness. PREDATOR and Premadoma
operate with very different feature sets (as shown in Table 1) and
make use of very different classifiers. According to a survey of de-
tection techniques by Kidmose et al. [13], only very few detection
methods use registrant data (neither does PREDATOR). Yet, as can
be seen from Figure 4, the registrant-related features (in green),
actually exhibit the highest information gain.
Unfortunately, though, at this time, a fair performance compar-
ison between PREDATOR and Premadoma is not feasible, given

register .eu domain names is implemented by the .eu TLD itself.
