I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

In the following line of code:
https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/bfbf4ed7f765ebf6760b22a598ad6e4eb9f6f244/src/Input/Input.js#L50

The easing function referenced does not exist in the theme definition. As a result, `easeInOut` will be used as the default value instead.
