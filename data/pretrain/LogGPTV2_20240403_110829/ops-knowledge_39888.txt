Check whether the NTP service has synchronized the time: Wait for a few minutes , you can use the following command again to check whether the NTP service has synchronized the correct time: sudo ntpq -p This command will display a list of NTP servers and their time synchronization status. 6. Set the system time zone: In Linux, the system time zone may be different from the actual time zone. To ensure that the time is displayed correctly, the system time zone must be configured. The system time zone can be set with the following command: sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata Select and set the time zone as desired. Note: Before setting up the NTP service, please make sure your Linux system can connect to the Internet normally.
