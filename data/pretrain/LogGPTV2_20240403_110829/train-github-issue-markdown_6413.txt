### Problem description
When navigating through forms, tabbing into a `Toggle` element displays a
rectangular translucent square imposed on top of the switch. I think we could
do better than this. It could at least be the circular like the switch is.
### Steps to reproduce
Go to http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/toggle and `tab` through the
Examples section.

My recommendation would be to make it look similar to disabled state, possibly
a different shade of gray.

I'd be happy to PR this once consensus is reached on how focus state should be
rendered.
