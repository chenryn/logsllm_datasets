the 
Luna Correspondence 
Protocol
The security of our world as we know it is at stake. The 
nature of our project may lend itself to abuse by 
malicious users, cooperate espionage, and even 
terrorism. More positive applications include freedom of 
speech and information under oppressive regimes, and 
personal privacy on a largely public network.
Why Are We Here?
•  Secure, un-traceable, anonymous communication. 
•  This is the Luna protocol.
•  This is our goal. 
Abstract
•  Luna is a revolutionary new protocol used to anonymously 
   transmit and receive data securely across the Internet.
•   Luna is based on finite improbabilities of vast random 
   data dispersal and exploits properties of IP to accomplish   
   a portion of it's goals.

Achieving Anonymity
the Luna way
Relaying Trickery
•  Luna makes use of well known and existing flaws in 
network protocols and conventional firewall 
implementations.
•  Luna uses tactics for which logging and filtering 
would be costly and impractical on high traffic relay 
hosts.
•  When properly implemented, Luna harms no host 
   along it’s path, or impairs it’s bandwidth.

Several means of host deception are employed to facilitate 
anonymous transfer:
•  MAC Address Spoofing (ISO Layer 2)- Luna assumes multiple 
   Media Access Control Addresses.
•  IP Address Spoofing (ISO Layer 3)- Luna bounces 
   transmissions off a high traffic 3rd party host using a source 
   address from the target destination.
Spoofing
Achieving Inefficiency
the Luna way
Inefficiency Briefing
•
Data must not be sent in a predictable fashion 
in predictable time
• 
Avoid all patterns
• Data must be reordered
• 
Avoid all patterns
• Data must be randomized
• 
Avoid all patterns
•
Data must contain false positives
• 
Avoid all patterns
And Then There is Crypto ... 
Cryptography is insufficient for primary means of 
communication, however it is far from trivial.
Achieving Security
the Luna way
Mathematical Permutation Function
P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!
N = total number of packets
R = set of packets composing real data 
(eliminating bogus packets)
Mathematical Permutation Function
P(60,10) = 60! / (60-10)!
P = 2.735898472+E17
P(100,80) = 100! / (100-10)!
P = Overflow
Arrg.  My trusty ti-83 can’t comprehend the 
possibilities of even 100 packets.

(all real; no bogus)
Packet-Level  Transmission
Data Filters
•  Filters are applied over the entire datum, before it’s chunked 
into packets
•  Filter plug-ins can be anything from encryption ciphers such 
as RSA, PGP, and Blowfish to Base64 and ASCII translation 
encoding
•  Filters are not applied to the start and stop sequences
Even if the Luna protocol is cracked or flawed and an 
encryption data filter is used (Base64 encoding isn’t an 
encryption data filter, it’s an encoding data filter), data is 
still secured by the encryption filters strength.  Thus, Luna is 
at least as strong as the weakest encryption filter used.
