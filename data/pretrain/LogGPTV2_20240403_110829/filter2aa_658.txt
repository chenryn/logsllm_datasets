# The Luna Correspondence Protocol

## Introduction
The security of our world as we know it is at stake. The nature of our project, while offering significant benefits such as freedom of speech and personal privacy, also carries the risk of abuse by malicious users, corporate espionage, and even terrorism.

### Why Are We Here?
- **Secure, untraceable, anonymous communication.**
- **This is the Luna protocol.**
- **This is our goal.**

## Abstract
Luna is a revolutionary new protocol designed to transmit and receive data securely and anonymously across the Internet. It leverages the finite improbabilities of vast random data dispersal and exploits properties of IP to achieve its objectives.

## Achieving Anonymity: The Luna Way
### Relaying Trickery
Luna utilizes well-known and existing flaws in network protocols and conventional firewall implementations. By employing tactics that make logging and filtering impractical on high-traffic relay hosts, Luna ensures that no host along its path is harmed or has its bandwidth impaired.

### Host-Level Transmission
The following diagram illustrates the host-level transmission process:

### Means of Host Deception
- **MAC Address Spoofing (ISO Layer 2)**: Luna assumes multiple Media Access Control Addresses.
- **IP Address Spoofing (ISO Layer 3)**: Luna bounces transmissions off a high-traffic third-party host using a source address from the target destination.

## Achieving Inefficiency: The Luna Way
### Inefficiency Briefing
- **Data must not be sent in a predictable fashion or at predictable times.**
- **Avoid all patterns.**
- **Data must be reordered and randomized.**
- **Data must contain false positives.**

## And Then There is Cryptography...
While cryptography is not the primary means of communication, it plays a crucial role. Luna employs various encryption ciphers and encoding methods to ensure data security.

## Achieving Security: The Luna Way
### Mathematical Permutation Function
The permutation function P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)! is used to calculate the number of possible packet arrangements. For example:
- **P(60, 10) = 60! / (50!) ≈ 2.735898472 × 10^17**
- **P(100, 80) = 100! / (20!)** (results in an overflow for most calculators)

### Packet-Level Transmission
- **Data Filters**: Filters are applied to the entire datum before it is chunked into packets. These filters can range from encryption ciphers like RSA, PGP, and Blowfish to encoding methods like Base64 and ASCII.
- **Filter Application**: Filters are not applied to the start and stop sequences. Even if the Luna protocol is cracked, the data remains secured by the strength of the encryption filters used.
