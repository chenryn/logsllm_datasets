User: I have to run a Python script on a Windows server. How can I know which version of Python I have, and does it even really matter?
I was thinking of updating to the latest version of Python.
Assistant: If you have Python installed then the easiest way you can check the version number is by typing "python" in your command prompt. It will show you the version number and if it is running on 32 bit or 64 bit and some other information. For some applications you would want to have a latest version and sometimes not. It depends on what packages you want to install or use.
