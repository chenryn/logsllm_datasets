To make your Python script executable and runnable with a double-click on a Fedora machine, follow these steps:

1. **Add Shebang Line:**
   Add the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env python3` at the very top of your Python script. This line tells the system to use the `python3` interpreter to run the script.

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   # Your Python code here
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your script. Use the `chmod` command to make the script executable.

   ```sh
   chmod +x your_script.py
   ```

3. **Set the Default Application for .py Files (Optional):**
   If you want to be able to run the script by double-clicking it, you can set the default application for `.py` files to use the `python3` interpreter.

   - Right-click on your script file.
   - Select "Properties."
   - Go to the "Open With" tab.
   - Click on "Show other applications."
   - Click on "Use a custom command."
   - Enter `python3 %f` in the command line.
   - Click "OK" to save the changes.

4. **Run the Script:**
   Now, you should be able to run the script by double-clicking it. The system will use the `python3` interpreter to execute the script.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that `python3` is installed on your system. You can check this by running `python3 --version` in the terminal.
- If you encounter any issues, you may need to specify the full path to the `python3` interpreter in the shebang line, such as `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

By following these steps, you should be able to run your Python script by simply double-clicking it on your Fedora machine.
