**Test file (self-contained)**  
Reproducible with random tests. The only required conditions are: parallel
execution and at least 1 retry
**Steps**
  * Run the test in parallel
  * Some of the tests should be retried
**Expected**  
Execution should stop by itself
**Actual**  
The teardown process hangs and gets killed by timeout for some tests, but
workers never stop.
Also I can see the next artifacts:
  * In CI I'm getting an error about a non-existent screenshot file:

  * Locally, it just hangs without any issues. But even though the passed test, in this case, is treated as Broken and screenshot+video attached.
