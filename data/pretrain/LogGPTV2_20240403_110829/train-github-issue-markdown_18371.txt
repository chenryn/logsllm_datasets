When trying to drag the mouse in order to select text, nothing happen and the
cursor stays where the mouse was first clicked. It also prevent from drag and
dropping tabs in the same way.
I had the same bug as soon as I updated my Google Chrome to version 41. I had
to add this flag '--touch-devices=123' when opening it as mentionned in this
issue tracker:

I do not know how I can add this flag for Atom?
