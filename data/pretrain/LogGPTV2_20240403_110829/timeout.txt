timeout
Pauses the command processor for the specified number of seconds. This command is typically used in batch files.
Syntax
timeout /t  [/nobreak]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
/t 
Specifies the decimal number of seconds (between -1 and 99999) to wait before the command processor continues processing. The value -1 causes the computer to wait indefinitely for a keystroke.
/nobreak
Specifies to ignore user key strokes.
/?
Displays help at the command prompt.
Remarks
A user keystroke resumes the command processor execution immediately, even if the timeout period has not expired.
When used in conjunction with the resource kit's Sleep tool, timeout is similar to the pause command.
Examples
To pause the command processor for ten seconds, type:
timeout /t 10
To pause the command processor for 100 seconds and ignore any keystroke, type:
timeout /t 100 /nobreak
To pause the command processor indefinitely until a key is pressed, type:
timeout /t -1
