User: I've installed Miniconda and have added the environment variable export PATH="/home/username/miniconda3/bin:$PATH" to my .bashrc and .bash_profile but still can't run any conda commands in my terminal.
Am I missing another step in my setup? I'm using zsh by the way.
Assistant: I had the same issue. I just closed and reopened the terminal, and it worked. That was because I installed anaconda with the terminal open.
