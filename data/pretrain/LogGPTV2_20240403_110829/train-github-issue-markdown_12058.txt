This is valid typescript
    interface Bar {
        name: string;
    }
    export default Bar;
However, the compiler complains if I do this:
    export default interface Bar {
        name: string;
    }
I would have expected this to work in both cases as if I substitute
`interface` with `class` it works fine.
Reading the spec here,
https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/spec.md#11.3.4, shows
that interfaces cannot be part of a default export, but why?
Thanks!
