  * Electron version: 1.4.4
  * Operating system: Windows 10
Scenario:  
I want to paste a copied image in my Electron app. But when I copy an image in
Windows Explorer (png or jpg) and try to retrieve it from Clipboard,
Clipboard.readImage() returns an empty NativeImage Object.
Based on the docs, I assumed it would work with all operating systems:

The same code is working fine in macOS. But the majority of our customers are
using Windows.
