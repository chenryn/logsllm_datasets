Question: "In reviewing a software module's design, a developer argues that there is no need to strictly enforce argument types for function calls since the programming language being used is loosely typed. Which of the following is the best counterargument to this claim?"
 "A": "Loosely typed languages can still suffer from unexpected behaviors when the wrong data types are passed to functions, leading to potential security weaknesses."
 "B": "Strictly enforcing argument types will significantly reduce the execution speed of the application, which is undesirable."
 "C": "In a loosely typed language, the compiler automatically corrects any type mismatches, so there is no need for concern."
 "D": "The developer should focus solely on optimizing the code for performance, rather than worrying about argument types."
Answer: A
