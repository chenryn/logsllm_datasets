How I can just check URL in new tab opened after link clicking, and at once
abort all traffic to avoid not needed network traffic generation.  
I tried with below test but it is not working.
### System info
  * Playwright Version: [v1.34]

### Source code
  * [ x] I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.  
Using default config
    import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';
    test('verify link in new tab', async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
        const popupPromise = page.waitForEvent('popup');
        await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'GitHub repository' }).click();
        const popup = await popupPromise;
         //synchronous below - will not fully work
        await popup.route('**/*', (route) => route.abort());
        await popup.waitForLoadState();
        await expect(popup).toHaveURL('https://github.com/microsoft/playwright');
    });
