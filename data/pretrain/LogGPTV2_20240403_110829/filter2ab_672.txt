### Title: Blackhat US-19: Zombie Ant Farming - Practical Tips for Evasive Linux EDR Play

**Abstract:**

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions have expanded their reach to Linux environments, making it imperative for offensive operators to adapt. In this two-part talk, we will share practical tips and code techniques to help the offense evade EDR detection and enhance post-exploitation capabilities.

**Part One: Evasion Techniques**

In the first part of the talk, we will delve into practical methods and code snippets that can be used to bypass EDR detection. We will cover:

- **Decoy Executables:** How to use approved executables as decoys to execute foreign code without raising suspicion.
- **Linux Malware Primitives:** An overview of the building blocks and primitives of Linux malware, including those that can be invoked by the dynamic ELF loader and process bootstrap routines.
- **Evasion Tactics:** Actionable and battle-tested tips to assist Red Teams in evading EDRs, supported by real-world examples.

**Part Two: Expanding and Weaponizing Capabilities**

The second part of the talk will focus on expanding and weaponizing the capabilities of the offense. We will discuss:

- **Chained Preloaders:** Techniques for creating feature-rich chained preloaders and using mimicry to hide modular malware during execution.
- **Memory-Assisted "Preloader-as-a-Service":** A demonstration of a memory-assisted preloading capability that abstracts the storage of malware from its executing cradles.
- **Operationalizing Memory-Based Implants:** Strategies for operationalizing Linux memory-based implants.
- **Cross-Memory Attach Injection:** Methods for evading EDRs using cross-memory attach injection in deliberately ASLR-weakened executables.

**Toolkit and Reusability:**

We believe that the ability to retool in the field is more valuable than standalone tools. Therefore, we have packaged the techniques discussed into reusable code patterns in a toolkit that attendees can use or draw inspiration from after the talk.

**Defense Mitigation:**

The talk will conclude with pointers for defenders to mitigate the techniques we have demonstrated. Additionally, we will reveal the intriguing connection between "Zombies" and "Ants" in the context of our discussion.

Join us for an in-depth exploration of these advanced evasion and exploitation techniques, and leave with a toolkit to enhance your offensive and defensive capabilities.
