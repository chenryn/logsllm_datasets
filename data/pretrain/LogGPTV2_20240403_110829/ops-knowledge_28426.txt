User: I currently have both Python 2.6 and 2.7 running on my Linux machine.
Now, from Python 2.7, I can't access the libraries that I installed through package manager for Python 2.6.
I tried uninstalling the library and installing it back with Python 2.7 installed as my default runtime. No luck.
How can I share libraries between two Python instances? Is there a more correct way to do this than just copying them?
If useful: my Linux distro is Debian, and my package manager is apt.
Assistant: You should be able to install the files to an external location and define the environment variable PYTHONPATH to point to the directory that contains the modules.
