### 4. Viewing Replication History

A summary of replications performed on each subscription or master node can be viewed in the xDB Replication Console. Detailed replication history, including each insert, update, and deletion made against each target table, can also be viewed. For more details on how changes are applied to target tables, refer to Section 2.2.9 for the target-based method and Section 2.2.10 for the log-based method of synchronization replication.

#### Note (For SMR Only):
- The replication history can be viewed from both the **Publication** and **Subscription** nodes.
- The history shown for a **Publication** node is the same set of inserts, updates, and deletions made on the subscription tables by the publication server during synchronization.
- The history for a **Publication** node does not show the actual SQL statements processed on the publication tables that originated from user applications.

#### Note (For MMR Only):
- The replication history can be viewed from the **Publication** node under any master node in the multi-master replication system.
- The history includes inserts, updates, and deletions made on all publication tables of all master nodes by the publication server during synchronization.
- The history appears the same regardless of the master node under which it is viewed.

### 4.1 All Replication History

Replication history shows the following types of events that occur on a given subscription or master node:
- Snapshot replications
- Synchronization replications where at least one change (insert, update, or deletion) was applied to a target table
- Synchronization replications where no updates were applied to any of the target tables since the last restart of the publication server

#### Steps to View Replication History:

##### For SMR (Single-Master Replication):
1. Select the node beneath the **Subscription** node. Tabs labeled **General**, **Realtime Monitor**, and **Replication History** will appear.

##### For MMR (Multi-Master Replication):
1. Select any **Publication** node under a **Database** node representing a master node. Tabs labeled **General**, **Realtime Monitor**, **Replication History**, and **Conflict History** will appear.

2. Click the **Replication History** tab to view the history of replications.

**Note:** Every snapshot replication and each synchronization replication with at least one update produces a history record maintained in replication history tables in the control schema. Over time, the size of these tables will grow. Replication history records can be periodically deleted. See Section 7.5.3 for information on cleaning up replication history.

### 4.2 Hiding Synchronizations With Zero Transaction Counts

You may notice synchronization replications with transaction counts of zero. These records indicate that there were no changes to synchronize at the time the replication occurred. For scheduled replications that occur frequently, this may result in a large number of lines in the **Replication History** tab, thus obscuring the more meaningful replications with non-zero transaction counts.

#### Steps to Hide Records with Zero Transaction Counts:

1. Check the **Show History With Transactions Count > 0** checkbox located at the bottom of the **Replication History** tab.
2. The next time the **Replication History** tab refreshes, only the replications with non-zero transaction counts will appear.

**Note:** Zero transaction count replication records are maintained in the publication server memory. By default, they are not permanently stored on disk. Therefore, when the publication server is shut down, the in-memory zero transaction count replication records are no longer available. When the publication server starts running again, zero transaction count replication records will reappear on the **Replication History** tab as zero transaction count replications occur.

If you wish to permanently store zero transaction count replication records to disk, set the publication server configuration option `persistZeroTxRepEvent` to `true`. See Section 10.4.1.12 for further information.

### 4.3 Shadow Table History

Expanding the nodes under the **Subscription** node of a single-master replication system, or the **Publication** node of a multi-master replication system provides more information about the subscription or publication.

#### Steps to View Shadow Table History:

1. Select a table to reveal tabs that contain general information about the table and the replication history of the table. Expand a **Table** node to reveal the columns in the table.
2. Click the **Replication History** tab to view the history of replications for this table.
3. Click the **View Data** link to show a list of each change made to the table during the synchronization replication.

**Note:** Since all insert, update, and delete operations on all source tables are recorded in shadow tables, the size of the shadow tables may grow considerably over time for volatile source tables. The rows shown in the **Synchronize History** window are obtained from these shadow tables. Rows in the shadow tables can be periodically deleted. See Section 7.5.2 for information on cleaning up the shadow tables.

### 5. Managing History

xDB Replication Server maintains three types of history:
- **Shadow Table History**: Records of each change (insert, update, or delete) that was applied to each target table during synchronization replications using the trigger-based method. There is no shadow table history for synchronization replications using the log-based method.
- **Replication History**: Summary records of each replication.
- **Event History**: Records of each change that was applied to various control schema tables.

The size of the control schema tables that store these history records grows over time, and thus there are several methods referred to as cleanup to delete such history records. See the following sections for more details:
- Shadow table history cleanup: Sections 7.5.1 and 7.5.2
- Replication history cleanup: Section 7.5.3
- Event history cleanup: Section 7.5.4

### 5.1 Scheduling Shadow Table History Cleanup

A preference can be set for each publication database definition to determine if and when shadow table history cleanup should be scheduled for all publications appearing under its corresponding **Publication Database** node.

#### Steps to Alter the Default Setting:

1. Ensure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication database definition is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.2.1 for directions on starting and registering a publication server.
2. Select the **Publication Database** node for which you want to set the cleanup scheduling preference.
3. From the **Publication** menu, choose **Preferences**. Alternatively, right-click on the **Publication Database** node and choose **Preferences**. The **Publication Server Preferences** dialog box will appear.
4. In the **Publication Server Preferences** dialog box, uncheck the box if you do not want to run a scheduled shadow table history cleanup job. Click the **OK** button and skip the remaining steps.
5. If you want to schedule shadow table history cleanup, ensure the **Run Cleanup Job** checkbox is selected. Choose the frequency for the cleanup job:
   - **Every number of minutes/hours**: Schedules shadow table history cleanup to run continuously at an interval in either minutes or hours that you specify.
   - **Every Day at hour of day**: Schedules shadow table history cleanup to run once a day on the hour you choose.
   - **Every selected day of week at hour of day**: Schedules shadow table history cleanup to run once a week on the day and at the hour you choose.
   - **Cron Expression**: Provides additional flexibility for specifying a schedule beyond the three preceding radio button choices. See Appendix Section 10.4.3 for directions on writing a cron expression.
6. Click the **OK** button to accept the schedule.

### 5.2 Cleaning Up Shadow Table History

Non-snapshot-only publications (i.e., publications on which synchronization replications occur) whose tables experience frequent changes should have their shadow table history cleaned up periodically, otherwise, the amount of disk space consumed by the shadow tables in the publication database may grow too rapidly.

When shadow table history is cleaned up, the rows in the following xDB Replication Server metadata tables are deleted:
- `RREP_TXSET`
- `RREP_TXSET_LOG`
- `RRST_schema_table`

#### Steps to Run Shadow Table History Cleanup On Demand:

1. Ensure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication whose shadow table history you wish to clean up is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.2.1 for directions on starting and registering a publication server.
2. Select the **Publication** node of the publication for which you want to clean up the shadow table history.
3. From the **Publication** menu, choose **Cleanup Shadow Table History**. Alternatively, right-click on the **Publication** node and choose **Cleanup Shadow Table History**. The **Cleanup Synchronization History** confirmation box will appear.
4. Click the **Yes** button in the **Cleanup Synchronization History** confirmation box.
5. Click the **Yes** button in response to the **Shadow Table’s Transaction History Removed Successfully** message.

After shadow table history cleanup, if you click the **View Data** link of the **Replication History** tab, an information message will appear stating that there is no synchronization history to view.

### 5.3 Cleaning Up Replication History

Cleaning up replication history deletes rows from the following tables in the control schema:
- `xdb_pub_replog`
- `xdb_pub_table_replog`

#### Steps to Run Replication History Cleanup for a Chosen Publication:

1. Ensure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.2.1 for directions on starting and registering a publication server.
2. Select the **Publication** node of the publication for which you want to clean up the replication history.
3. From the **Publication** menu, choose **Cleanup Replication History**. Alternatively, right-click on the **Publication** node and choose **Cleanup Replication History**. The **Cleanup Replication History** confirmation box will appear.
4. Click the **Yes** button in the **Cleanup Replication History** confirmation box.
