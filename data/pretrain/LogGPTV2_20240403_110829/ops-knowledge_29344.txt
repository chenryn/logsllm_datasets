User: When I type python into the command line, the command prompt says python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. What should I do?
Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.
Assistant: Add the python bin directory to your computer's PATH variable. Its listed under Environment Variables in Computer Properties -> Advanced Settings in Windows 7. It should be the same for Windows 8.
