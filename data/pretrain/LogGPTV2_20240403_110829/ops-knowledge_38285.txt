User: This has probably been asked before but I can't seem to find the answer. I've moved from windows to Linux and started using PyDev (Aptana) recently but what I cannot seem to find is how to find all references to a function.
Assistant: Ctrl+Shift+G will find all the references to a function in PyDev (F3 will go to the definition of a function).
