### Describe your issue.
Following up to #1616
When the input for `distance_transform_edt` has no background, the results are
unexpected.  
As in the previous issue, the expectation would be that the function would
return an array of zeros.  
However, the output distances are based on the distance from (-1, 0), which
seems incorrect.  
I'm currently having to check if the array has a background or not before
using the function, but would like the function to have a more consistent
output.
### Reproducing Code Example
    In [1]: import numpy as np
    In [2]: from scipy.ndimage.morphology import distance_transform_edt
    In [3]: distance_transform_edt(np.ones((3,3), dtype=int), return_indices=True)
    Out[3]:
    (array([[1.        , 1.41421356, 2.23606798],
            [2.        , 2.23606798, 2.82842712],
            [3.        , 3.16227766, 3.60555128]]),
     array([[[-1, -1, -1],
             [-1, -1, -1],
             [-1, -1, -1]],
            [[ 0,  0,  0],
             [ 0,  0,  0],
             [ 0,  0,  0]]], dtype=int32))
