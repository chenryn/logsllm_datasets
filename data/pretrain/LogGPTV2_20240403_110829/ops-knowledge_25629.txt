User: How to securely store and manage sensitive data for container applications?
Assistant: To securely store and manage sensitive data for container applications, the following methods can be adopted: 1. Use keys or certificates to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data to ensure that only authorized personnel can access it. 2. Use the encrypted cloud storage service to store sensitive data and access it through the access key to ensure data security. 3. Adopt multi-level authentication and access control measures, such as role-based access control and multi-factor authentication, to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data. 4. Use container security scanning tools to regularly detect and repair vulnerabilities and security issues in container images. 5. Use container orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, to automate the deployment and management of containers, and provide secure configuration and powerful authentication and authorization functions. 6. Regularly conduct security vulnerability scanning and security event detection to discover and respond to security threats in containers in a timely manner. 7. Cooperate with third-party security service providers, such as security audit, threat intelligence and vulnerability management, to provide more comprehensive and professional container security protection measures.
