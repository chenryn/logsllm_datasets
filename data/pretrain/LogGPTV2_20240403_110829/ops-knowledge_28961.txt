User: Our database requirement is high availability. Please list common database replication solutions and explain their implementation principles, advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Commonly used database replication schemes include: 1. Master-Slave Replication (Master-Slave Replication) Implementation principle: The master database (Master) synchronizes write operations to the slave database (Slave), thereby ensuring data synchronization. Advantages: Real-time data synchronization, can share the reading pressure, and can realize disaster recovery and disaster recovery. Disadvantages: Failure of the main library will cause the write operation to fail, and the data of the slave library is only the latest synchronized data, which is not real-time and cannot be used to share the writing pressure. 2. Master-Master Replication Implementation principle: Two master databases (Masters) synchronize write operations with each other, and achieve data synchronization consistency through a locking mechanism. Advantages: Real-time data synchronization, which can share the pressure of reading and writing, and can realize disaster recovery and disaster recovery. Disadvantages: There is a locking mechanism, which will reduce the concurrency performance, and the database architecture needs to be specially designed. 3. Read-Write Splitting Implementation principle: The read operation is assigned to the slave library for processing, and the write operation is still processed by the master library. Advantages: Scalability can be achieved, read performance can be improved, and main library resources can be saved. Disadvantage: The slave database data is not synchronized in real time, and the read operation will be affected when the master database fails. 4. Shared Disk Replication (Shared Disk Replication) Implementation principle: multiple database servers share the same disk, and realize data synchronization through the file lock mechanism. Advantages: simple implementation, easy deployment and maintenance. Disadvantages: Disk failure will affect the normal work of all databases and is not suitable for large-scale distributed systems. 5. Distributed Replication (Distributed Replication) Implementation principle: The data is distributed and stored on multiple database servers, and the data synchronization is realized through the consistent hash algorithm. Pros: Enables high availability and scalability. Disadvantages: The implementation is more complicated, and it takes more time and effort to design and maintain. At the same time, due to the decentralized storage of data, it is difficult to guarantee data consistency. In short, different database replication schemes have their own advantages and disadvantages, and it is necessary to choose an appropriate scheme according to actual needs and business scenarios. A high-availability database system should have features such as real-time synchronization, backup and recovery, and scalability.
