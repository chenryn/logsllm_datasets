### Version
2.6.11
### Reproduction link
https://jsfiddle.net/sqh8jL65/4/
### Steps to reproduce
  1. Add the bindings `:selected="'selected'"` and `:random="'random'"` to an `option` element.
### What is expected?
The `option` element is rendered in the DOM with both the
`selected="selected"` and `random="random"` attributes present.
### What is actually happening?
The `option` element is rendered in the DOM with only the `random="random"`
attribute present.

When writing a template with a `select` element which is using `@change` and
`:selected` bindings on its `option` elements, I expect the resulting DOM to
contain the `selected` attribute. I need this because thatâ€™s how native HTML
behaves and because it would allow me to select the selected option using vue-
test-utils and `wrapper.find('option[selected]')` which is currently
impossible ( **Update** : one can use `wrapper.find('option:checked')` as a
workaround).
