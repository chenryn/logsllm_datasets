##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.5
##### Environment:
N/A
##### Summary:
npm module won't install a package if it is installed as another package's
dependency
##### Steps To Reproduce:
    - name: Install less compiler, css minifier
      npm: name={{ item }}
      with_items:
        - less
        - clean-css
##### Expected Results:
clean-css should be installed, as it will be if you run:
    # npm install less clean-css
##### Actual Results:
clean-css is not installed.
This is because the npm module is misinterpreting the results of npm list. If
the less package is installed, `npm list --json clean-css` returns:
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "less": {
          "version": "1.7.0",
          "from": "less@",
          "dependencies": {
            "clean-css": {
              "version": "2.1.6",
              "from": "clean-css@2.1.x"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
The npm module interprets this to mean that clean-css is installed.
