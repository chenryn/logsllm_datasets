usable and reliable. Prior research has shown that the SMS
delivery failure ratio can be as high as 5.1% during normal
operating conditions [67]. Indeed, in our study, some of the
12    30th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
ESM questionnaires were not delivered (see Section 3.3.3).
Moreover, the mechanism will not be secure against a compro-
mised phone. Although the situation did not happen during
our study, and we did not use SMS for authentication, we ar-
gue that future video-based social authentication should avoid
using SMS due to its usability and reliability issues.
6 Limitations
This study has a number of limitations. One limitation is
that our sample is composed primarily of people living on
the east coast of the U.S. and therefore may not be represen-
tative of other areas of the United States or the rest of the
world. Furthermore, like other published studies [6, 47], our
sample is mostly white, highly educated, young, and high
socio-economic status. On the other hand, participants’ phone
use, the apps they had on their phone, and passcode use were
similar to many mobile phone users in the U.S. [15, 43]. We
recruited participates in two phases. First, we recruited partic-
ipants using social media, ﬂyers, and word of mouth. Then,
we used snowball sampling to recruit members of those par-
ticipants’ social networks. Social networks tend to be demo-
graphically homogeneous [66]. We prioritized social network
connections because one of our goals is about whether mem-
bers of the social network would be more willing to help each
other rather than strangers (we found they were). Therefore,
these results may serve as a foundation for understanding
what motivates people when social networks are used as part
of the authentication process. We encourage replication of
this work with a broader population.
Second, during the study, there were a few technical issues
and human errors. For example, as we mentioned in Section 3,
two participants were not able to receive any ESM messages,
and some responses were sent incorrectly by participants
(entered the wrong people’s name they were helping) thus,
we cannot match with participants’ responses. We simply
eliminated these participants and responses from the analy-
sis. Given the overall response rate and the small number of
these mistakes, we do not expect that the discarded responses
impacted the overall results of the study.
Third, as in many similar studies [57, 68, 84], participants
did not respond to every prompt we sent them. Participants
in this study exhibited around a 47 – 64% response rate for
the last two weeks of this study. We do not know whether
non-responses indicate a lack of willingness to engage in
authentication via video-chat, although to be conservative,
as we discussed in Section 4, this is what we have assumed
throughout this paper.
Fourth, there are potential security issues in the use of
video chat as an authentication method such as video spooﬁng
or “deep fakes” [85]. Future work could explore potential
intervention mechanisms to help identify or prevent video
spooﬁng. Future work could also explore privacy-enhancing
technologies to prevent other potential privacy issues of using
this system, such as harassment or stalking [41], since it is
possible that people could misuse this system to stalk or harass
others, as is unfortunately common in many other systems
that connect people.
Fifth, as in all studies that rely on users’ self-reported data,
our results are limited by reporting errors [18] and respondent
adherence [45] because of our reliance on assumptions about
the compliance of our participants.
Sixth, although we did explore some of the factors such as
emotion (mood), we did not explore all sociocultural variables
in the study. Sociocultural and political-economic variables
and the inﬂuence of power dynamics are factors that may
inﬂuence the behavior of the sampled participants [89], but
coverage of all these variables was beyond the scope of this
paper. Future work should consider how these variables will
inﬂuence the adoption and utilization of video-based social
authentication by the public.
Finally, we did not require participants to complete an ac-
tual authentication process (i.e., we did not install software on
their phones that prevented them from using any of their apps).
Instead, we used ESM to simulate an authentication process
by video chat. Since we prompted participants at random
times throughout the day and surveyed them at that moment,
we were able to gather large amounts of in situ data about how
a person might be motivated to engage in, or not engage in,
friendsourced authentication based on their various feelings,
location, and level of trust. We anticipated that the beneﬁts of
surveying participants on their own unmodiﬁed phones would
outweigh the drawbacks of a modiﬁed authentication process,
at least initially. Furthermore, we were interested in gathering
a large amount of data about emotion, time of day, etc. In a
real authentication scenario, we anticipate that social authen-
tication would be a rare event, perhaps saved for a password
reset or other unusual event rather than multiple times per
day, week, or even month event. Waiting for these events to
occur would have meant we were not able to interrogate a
large number of events to determine the effects of feelings,
location, etc.
Notably, some participants reported that they thought they
were indeed helping the people in their network by authen-
ticating them. For example, one participant mentioned: “I
thought every time I texted for help, that person had chosen
me when they selected someone to help them access their app.
I thought it was weird since I don’t actually know them, but I
helped anyway.” (P8). While another reported: “I just wanted
to be helpful.” (P13). This indicates that at least some par-
ticipants thought their responses were behavioral rather than
attitudinal. Future work should examine whether the results
we report here replicate during real authentication situations.
7 Conclusion
Finding new ways to make authentication more secure and
reliable is crucial. Our research suggests social authentication

using video chat might beneﬁt end-users while also leveraging
a form of human-to-human identiﬁcation that could be more
reliable than alternatives. Our paper provides insights into
contextual factors that may affect the use of video chat as a
fallback authentication method in a small social network (e.g.,
family members and close friends). Among these contextual
factors, the trust of others, mood, location, and the presence
of others stand out as they are associated with the willing-
ness to use video chat as a fallback authentication method.
Besides these opportunities, all authentication methods, in-
cluding video-based social authentication, have challenges.
For example, the response rate could heavily rely on its users’
social ties and the contextual factors we found. While having
these challenges, all the participants in the study agreed to
initiate and help a video-based social authentication prompt
at least once. When excluding non-responses, participants
agreed to initiate or help for more than 40% of the time. The
majority of the participants also showed the comfort of using
video-based social authentication. With having these opportu-
nities and challenges in mind, we believe video-based social
authentication is a meaningful direction and needs further
exploration. Our paper offers useful insights for the design of
future, video-based social authentication systems.
