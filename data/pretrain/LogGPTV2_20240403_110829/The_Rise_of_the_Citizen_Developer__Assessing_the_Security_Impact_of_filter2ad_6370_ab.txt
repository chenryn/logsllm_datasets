We utilized a set of distinctive features to classify a large corpus of 2,291,898 unique free Android applications. These apps were collected from the Google Play Store between August 2015 and May 2017 using a web crawler. The crawler begins with a predefined set of URL seeds and follows recommendation links to explore the store. It revisits previously found apps daily, downloading only new versions. Our analysis focused solely on the latest version of each app.

### 1. Features

To identify unique characteristics of application generators, we conducted a differential analysis between a baseline app and sample apps generated by each application generator. The baseline app was a simple "Hello World" application created in Android Studio, without any external third-party libraries. We then manually reverse-engineered all sample apps and compared them with the baseline app based on typical Android app components. This process involved analyzing the structure of an Android app and identifying elements that distinguish generated apps from manually developed ones. Our analysis yielded four primary features, which can be further sub-classified into six distinct Fingerprinting Features (see Table 1).

- **App Package Names**: The package name is a unique identifier for each app in the Google Play Store. Application generators often use specific patterns for package names, such as `com.Tobit.*` or `{com|net}.andromo.dev*`.

- **Code Namespaces**: Java code is organized into namespaces. Application generators may use specific namespaces that can be used for classification. For example, Andromo apps include namespaces like `.andromo.dev` or `com.andromo`, while Tobit Chayns apps use `com.Tobit.android.slitte.Slitte`. In contrast, Apps Geyser uses `com.w*`, which is too ambiguous for reliable classification.

- **Signing Keys**: Before uploading an app to the Google Play Store, APKs must be digitally signed to ensure that updates are distributed by the same entity. A single key is often used to sign multiple apps. For instance, Seattle Cloud uses a unique key for all its apps. If application generators use distinct keys, additional information from the certificate, such as the subject, can be used for fingerprinting. AppYet apps, for example, share the same certificate subject: `/C=CA /ST=ON /L=Oakville /O=AppYet /CN=www.appyet.com`.

- **Files**: Apps include various files, such as images, CSS, and configuration files. These can also be used for classification. For example, AppyPie apps contain the file `appypie.xml` in the `assets/www` folder. Additionally, we use file content for classification, such as verifying if the `<url>` and `<domain>` elements in `res/raw/configuration.xml` of AppsGeyser apps contain `appgeyser.com`.

### 2. Methodology

Our classification process began by extracting the aforementioned features from our sample apps. We found that each application generator has multiple distinguishing features, and in all cases, a single feature is sufficient to uniquely identify the generator. The overall classification of application generators and their features is detailed in Table 1 under the "Fingerprinting Features" columns.

In a separate investigation, we also fingerprinted apps not created using application generators. We focused on the two major platforms for Android app development: Eclipse ADT (support ended in August 2015) and Android Studio. We manually analyzed apps developed with both IDEs, similar to our approach for application generators. Our findings showed that Android Studio apps can be reliably identified by the presence of a `res/mipmap` folder, which stores launcher images. This folder structure was introduced in Android Studio 1.1, so only apps developed with at least version 1.1 of Android Studio have this feature.
