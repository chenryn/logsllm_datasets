To ensure data security in the production environment, a comprehensive and reliable backup and recovery strategy for the database is essential. Below is a feasible plan to address this requirement:

### 1. Backup Strategy

- **Full Backup:**
  - Perform a full backup of the database once a week.
  - Retain the last four weeks' worth of full backup files.

- **Incremental Backup:**
  - Conduct incremental backups every 12 hours.
  - Keep the last two weeks' worth of incremental backup files.

- **Transaction Log Backup:**
  - Back up transaction logs every 15 minutes.
  - Retain log backup files for the last seven days.

### 2. Recovery Strategy

- **Data Restoration Process:**
  1. In the event of a failure, start by restoring the most recent full backup.
  2. Apply the latest incremental backup and transaction log backups to bring the database to the most current state.
  3. If any of the incremental or log backups cannot be restored, perform a more granular restoration, such as single-table or single-row recovery, as needed.

- **Pre-Recovery Precautions:**
  - Before initiating any data recovery, create a thorough backup of the existing data and store it in a secure location separate from the production environment.
  - Ensure that all backup files and recovery scripts are encrypted to protect data security.
  - Verify the integrity of the data before and after the recovery process to confirm that the restored data is complete and accurate.

- **Regular Testing:**
  - Regularly test the backup and recovery processes to ensure the reliability of the backups and the accuracy of the recovery procedures.

By implementing this plan, you can establish a robust backup and recovery system that minimizes data loss and ensures the integrity and availability of your production database.
