User: In order to ensure data security in the production environment, we need to set up a backup and recovery strategy for the database. Please provide a feasible plan.
Assistant: 1. Backup strategy: (1) Full backup: Full backup is performed once a week, and backup files of the last 4 weeks are kept. (2) Incremental backup: Incremental backup is performed every 12 hours, and backup files of the last 2 weeks are kept. (3) Log backup: The transaction log is backed up every 15 minutes, and the backup files of the last 7 days are saved. 2. Recovery strategy: (1) When a failure occurs, restore the full backup first, and then apply the latest incremental backup and log backup. (2) If the incremental backup and log backup after the full backup cannot be restored, data restoration with a gradually narrowed scope will be performed, including single-table restoration, single-row restoration, etc. (3) Before any data recovery, make a thorough data backup and store it in a safe location independent of the production environment. (4) During backup and recovery, backup files and recovery scripts need to be encrypted to ensure data security. At the same time, before data recovery, data integrity verification needs to be performed to ensure that the recovered data is complete and correct. (5) Regularly test the backup and recovery process to ensure the reliability of backup and the accuracy of recovery.
