User:  How to run a container after installing Docker?
Assistant: To run a container, use `docker run` command. Here are some examples: 1. Run a new container ``` docker run [image-name] ``` For example, if you want to use the `nginx` image to create a new container, you can run the following command: ``` docker run nginx ``` 2. Run a container and map the port ``` docker run -p [host-port]:[container-port] [image-name] ``` For example, if you want to use the `nginx` image to create a new container, and map port 80 of the container to port 8080 of the host, you can run the following command: ``` docker run -p 8080:80 nginx ``` 3. Run a container and specify the command ``` docker run [ image-name] [command] ``` For example, if you want to use the `ubuntu` image to create a new container and run the `/bin/bash` command, you can run the following command: ``` docker run ubuntu /bin/bash ``` 4. Run a container and specify environment variables ``` docker run -e [key=value] [image-name] ``` For example, if you want to use the `postgres` image to create a new container, and specify` POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable, you can run the following command: ``` docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword postgres ``` These examples are just some basic usage of `docker run` command. You can use the `docker run --help` command to view more options and parameters.
