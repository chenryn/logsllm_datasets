 Maritime Movements
The following services track ship movements around the globe.
• 
Marine Traffic (https://www.marinetraffic.com): This is the main 
marine-tracking site. Using this site, you can track any ship in the 
world. The site has a huge database of ship details and past tracking. 
To locate a ship, you can either search for its name using the site 
search facility or simply browse the live map to see all the available 
ships. To see specific ships details, click a ship on the map (ships 
appear as arrows on the live map). You can click the Vessel Details 
button (see Figure 7-12) to see complete information about this 
ship such as the name, MMSI number, IMO number, flag, weight, 
vessel type, dimensions, year built, latest position, vessel name 
history (if the ship changed its name, previous names and flags will 
appear here), and more. All this information is available with the free 
account (actually, I did not even register to view it). Paid accounts 
give more information, especially in relation to a customized map 
view, past tracking, and voyage history.

As we mentioned in Chapter 4, Google can also be used to locate publicly accessible 
webcams online. The best place to make such a search is the Google Hacking Database 
(GHDB) at https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database13/.
 Digital File Metadata
We already covered in Chapter 2 how to investigate the metadata of digital files (such as 
images, videos, Microsoft Office files, and PDF). Some digital files—especially geotagged 
images and videos—can contain GPS coordinates. Investigating such files is easy; all you 
need to do is copy the GPS coordinates and use the services in this chapter to locate the 
address on a map of the subject photo or video.
 Summary
Most user online activities can be associated with geolocation information. Locating 
information online through location-based searches can narrow down the results 
returned and make your investigation more focused.
In the next chapter, we will talk about something different from everything 
already mentioned. You will learn how to use different tools and techniques to gather 
intelligence—mostly technical information—about target IT infrastructure and websites.

CHAPTER 8
Technical Footprinting
Footprinting is the first task that hackers—both black and white hats—do before 
initiating their attacks against computerized systems. It is the act of using different tools 
and techniques to acquire as much information as they can before attacking the target. 
In the previous chapters, we covered how to use a wide array of tools and techniques to 
collect data online about different entities (such as people and organizations). However, 
we did not cover how to investigate a target’s own web pages and network to acquire 
technical information.
In Chapter 1, we defined OSINT as referring to all information that is publicly 
available. This means OSINT sources are distinguished from other forms of intelligence 
in being legally accessible by the public without breaching any privacy or copyright laws. 
This legal definition also applies to technical footprinting when identifying a target’s IT 
technologies, services, and networks.
In Chapter 1, we differentiated between three types of information gathering: 
passive, semipassive, and active. In this chapter, we are concentrating on the passive 
reconnaissance techniques only, as the other two methods may have a legal implication 
if applied without proper permission. Thus, you cannot consider them as belonging to 
the OSINT-gathering scope.
In passive reconnaissance, the target will know nothing about your information- 
gathering activities. You will not send any packets of data to target servers. Instead, you 
will browse the target website like any regular Internet visitor to look for interesting 
information. The amount of information gathered in this way is limited to what is 
presented on the target website. In semipassive reconnaissance, you are sending limited 
traffic to the target server. However, this traffic will not launch any alarm by the security 
systems implemented by the target organization’s network (firewall and IDS) because 
this traffic will resemble any regular Internet traffic behavior.
314
Both passive reconnaissance and semipassive reconnaissance are allowed by law 
in major countries (without obtaining a permit), although some countries may also 
consider some sorts of semipassive activities as a kind of illegal footprinting.
Note! Active reconnaissance involves interacting directly with the target system; 
you can achieve this in various ways. For example, you can use social engineering 
techniques to acquire information from a target’s help desk.
By doing passive reconnaissance, you can gather some useful technical information 
such as identifying the target organization’s IP addresses, extracting domain name 
information, identifying its subdomain names, and identifying the IT devices and 
technologies in use. In addition, you can collect traditional types of information (for 
example, employee names and e-mails and document metadata) from the target website 
that can be used to profile target employees.
 Investigate the Target Website
The first place you need to go when beginning your technical footprinting is the targeted 
company’s web pages. Investigating a company’s website will give you excessive 
amounts of useful information from a security perspective. The following are just some 
examples:
• 
Company address
• 
Branch office locations
• 
Key employees
• 
Open vacancies and job offers (job offers may reveal technologies 
used in the company)
• 
E-mail schema (by looking at staff e-mail addresses)
• 
Phone numbers
• 
Partner companies—or any company with a close business 
relationship
• 
Open hours and holidays

• 
News about target organization (merger or acquisition news)
• 
Technology used in building the target website
• 
E-mail system used (many organizations use open source technology 
like Horde and Roundcube)
• 
IT technologies (hardware and software) used by target organization
• 
VPN provider (if any)
• 
Digital files (such as PDF files and spreadsheets) and metadata (some 
organizations even post their inventory list, including IT equipment, 
on their websites)
• 
Privacy or security policy that lists IT security controls (for example, 
such documents may contain a password creation policy)
• 
Information about the organization’s employees
Web pages are composed of HTML code, so it is advisable to begin there. You can 
view the HTML source to see whether the developers left any useful information in the 
HTML comments. You need also to check the head section of the HTML source code 
for attached documents such as CSS and JavaScript files. These files may also contain 
comments by their developers.
Note! to view the htMl source code of any web page using Firefox, right-click 
the target page and select View page Source. You can find useful information 
within htMl comment tags that look like this: .
Many companies outsource their website design to foreign companies. Discovering 
this issue from the HTML source code will make the outsourced company part of your 
investigation endeavor.
Note! Firefox has a built-in utility for aiding web developers. the Firefox 
Developer tools are a set of web development tools that can be used to analyze the 
htMl source code of web pages. to launch the tool, press Ctrl+Shift+i or simply 
go to the tools menu, select Web Developer, and then select Developer toolbar.

 Investigate the Robots.txt File
Web robots—also known as crawlers or spiders—are used by search engines to scan the 
Web automatically to discover new content. They are used by all search engines such 
as Google and Yahoo to index web contents. Web site owners use the robots.txt file in 
their website root directory to give instructions to web robots on what pages they want 
to include or exclude during the crawling process. When a robot reads Disallow: in the 
robots.txt file, it will ignore the file path after it. For intelligence purposes, checking 
this file will reveal what the website owner wants to hide from the public. To view the 
robots.txt file of any website, type in your browser address bar the target domain name 
followed by a forward slash and then robots.txt. See Figure 8-1 for a sample robots.
txt file for the Apress.com domain name.
Note! robotsDisallowed is a project on github (https://github.com/
danielmiessler/RobotsDisallowed) that harvests the “Disallow” directories 
from the robots.txt files of the world’s top websites (taken from an Alexa 100K 
global ranking).

 Mirror the Target Website
Sometimes it is more convenient—when reviewing the HTML code—to download the 
entire target website for offline viewing/parsing, and there are automated tools for 
performing this task. The following are the most popular:
• 
HTTrack (https://www.httrack.com): Here you can copy a website 
for offline view.
• 
GNU Wget (www.gnu.org/software/wget): Here you can retrieve files 
using the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and FTPS Internet protocols.
• 
BlackWidow (www.softbytelabs.com/en/BlackWidow): Here you can 
download a complete site or part of it. You can also download any 
kind of files including YouTube videos embedded within a site.
 Extract the Links
A target website can be linked with other applications, web technologies, and related 
websites. Dumping its links will reveal such connections and give the URLs of other 
resources (such as CSS and JavaScript files) and domains connected with it. There are 
many online services to extract the URLs, images, scripts, iframes, and embeds of target 
websites. The following are the most popular (use more than one service as they do not 
return the same results):
• 
Link Extractor (www.webtoolhub.com/tn561364-link-extractor.
aspx): You can export the results to an Excel file.
• 
Free URL Extractor (www.bulkdachecker.com/url-extractor): 
Extract Links from URL/Domain (e.g. Links, images, scripts and 
Embeds).
• 
Link Gopher (https://sites.google.com/site/linkgopher): This is 
a Firefox add-on that extracts all the links from web pages, including 
embedded ones, and displays them in a new web page.
Note! to see where a target website Url redirects to, use the following service: 
http://redirectdetective.com.

 Check the Target Website’s Backlinks
You should also consider checking all backlinks to a target organization’s domain, as 
some linked websites may reveal useful information about the target. To see all linked 
websites to a specific domain name, type the following into Google: site:* darknessgate.
com (there should be a space between the asterisk and the domain name).
This will return all sites that link to www.DarknessGate.com. To refine the search and 
return only the results from other domain names, exclude all links to the target domain 
from itself (see Figure 8-2).
 Monitor Website Updates
You should monitor web updates of the target website regularly. Of course, it is not 
convenient to monitor a website with hundreds of pages, so there are tools to automate 
this task. A popular tool for this is WebSite-Watcher (http://aignes.com/index.htm), 
which is a commercial program. This software will monitor web pages, forums, and RSS 
feeds for new postings and replies (even the password-protected pages) and report the 
changes.
 Check the Website’s Archived Contents
OSINT investigators should remember that the Web is always changing. Organizations 
update their websites regularly, and past versions of the target website may leak 
important information. Therefore, make sure to take a look at the previous versions of 
the target website using the Wayback Machine (www.archive.org).
Note! to discover who is hosting any website, go to https://www.
whoishostingthis.com.
