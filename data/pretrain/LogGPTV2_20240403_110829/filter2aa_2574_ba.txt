# Digital File Metadata

As covered in Chapter 2, digital files (such as images, videos, Microsoft Office files, and PDFs) can contain metadata, including GPS coordinates. Investigating such files is straightforward; simply copy the GPS coordinates and use the services mentioned in this chapter to locate the address on a map.

# Summary

Most online activities can be associated with geolocation information. Location-based searches can help narrow down results and focus your investigation. In the next chapter, we will explore technical footprinting, which involves using tools and techniques to gather intelligence about target IT infrastructure and websites.

# Chapter 8: Technical Footprinting

Footprinting is the initial step hackers (both black and white hats) take before attacking computerized systems. It involves using various tools and techniques to gather as much information as possible about the target. While previous chapters covered data collection on entities like people and organizations, this chapter focuses on investigating a target’s own web pages and network to acquire technical information.

### Passive Reconnaissance

Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without alerting the target. You will not send any packets to the target server but instead browse the website like a regular user. This method is legally permissible in most countries and does not require permission. However, some semipassive and active methods may have legal implications if conducted without proper authorization.

### Investigate the Target Website

Begin your technical footprinting by examining the target company’s web pages. Useful information includes:

- Company address
- Branch office locations
- Key employees
- Open vacancies and job offers
- E-mail schema
- Phone numbers
- Partner companies
- Open hours and holidays
- News about the organization
- Technology used in building the website
- E-mail system
- IT technologies
- VPN provider
- Digital files and metadata
- Privacy or security policy
- Employee information

Web pages are composed of HTML code, so it is advisable to start there. View the HTML source to find comments or attached documents like CSS and JavaScript files, which may contain additional information.

**Note:** To view the HTML source code in Firefox, right-click the page and select "View Page Source." Look for comments within `<!-- -->` tags.

Many companies outsource their website design, which can be discovered from the HTML source code and should be considered in your investigation.

**Firefox Developer Tools:** These tools can be accessed by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+I` or through the "Tools" menu under "Web Developer."

### Investigate the Robots.txt File

Web robots, or crawlers, are used by search engines to index web content. The `robots.txt` file in a website’s root directory instructs these robots on which pages to include or exclude. Checking this file can reveal what the website owner wants to hide from the public. To view the `robots.txt` file, append `/robots.txt` to the domain name in your browser.

**Note:** The RobotsDisallowed project on GitHub harvests "Disallow" directories from the `robots.txt` files of top websites.

### Mirror the Target Website

Sometimes, it is more convenient to download the entire website for offline viewing. Popular tools for this include:

- **HTTrack (https://www.httrack.com)**
- **GNU Wget (www.gnu.org/software/wget)**
- **BlackWidow (www.softbytelabs.com/en/BlackWidow)**

### Extract the Links

Extracting links from a target website can reveal connections to other applications, web technologies, and related websites. Popular online services for this include:

- **Link Extractor (www.webtoolhub.com/tn561364-link-extractor.aspx)**
- **Free URL Extractor (www.bulkdachecker.com/url-extractor)**
- **Link Gopher (https://sites.google.com/site/linkgopher)**

**Note:** To see where a URL redirects, use [Redirect Detective](http://redirectdetective.com).

### Check the Target Website’s Backlinks

Backlinks can provide useful information about the target. To find backlinks, use the following Google search: `site:* darknessgate.com` (with a space between the asterisk and the domain name). Exclude self-links to refine the search.

### Monitor Website Updates

Regularly monitor updates to the target website. Tools like **WebSite-Watcher (http://aignes.com/index.htm)** can automate this task, reporting changes to web pages, forums, and RSS feeds.

### Check the Website’s Archived Contents

Past versions of a website may contain important information. Use the **Wayback Machine (www.archive.org)** to view archived contents.

**Note:** To discover who is hosting a website, visit [WhoIsHostingThis](https://www.whoishostingthis.com).
