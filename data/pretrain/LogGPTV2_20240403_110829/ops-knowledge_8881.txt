User: some months ago, I installed Python 2.7 on my laptop (my os is Windows 7). 
After, I decided to use Python xy 2.7.3 instead of 'pure' Python; so, as suggested, I removed Python 2.7 and tried to install Python xy 2.7.3. However, when I tried to run the .exe file for installation, a warning window appears telling me that Python 2.7 is already installed on my computer. I tried to install a different version of Python xy (2.6) and everything went fine; however, I'd really prefer to use the latest version of Python xy. 
Actually, I can't figure out what went wrong whie uninstalling Python 2.7; does someone have any clue?
I can tell you that I followed the 'normal' procedure for programm uninstalltion; control panel -> Programs -> Remove Program
Thanks in advance

Assistant: I installed Enthought before. When I wanted to install Python(x,y) instead, I met the problems above.
After I had tried to uninstall Enthought and Python(x,y) from the Control Panel and then restart the PC, the problem still occured the next time I installed Python(x,y). 
I solved this problem by:

deleting all the relevant files in C:/User/UserName/AppData/ about Python, including the third party softwares like Enthought; 
deleting the Path in user and system Environment;
=====the two steps were failed if I didn't do the third step.=====
deleting the  register keys as @Daniel said. (include all the relevant keys with the prefix py if you installed the third party software about Python. )

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Python\
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Python
