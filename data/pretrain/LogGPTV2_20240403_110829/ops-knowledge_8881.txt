Subject: Issue with Installing Python(x,y) 2.7.3 After Uninstalling Python 2.7

Dear Support Team,

A few months ago, I installed Python 2.7 on my laptop, which runs Windows 7. Subsequently, I decided to switch to Python(x,y) 2.7.3 instead of the standard Python distribution. Following the recommended procedure, I uninstalled Python 2.7 and attempted to install Python(x,y) 2.7.3. However, when I tried to run the .exe file for installation, a warning message appeared, stating that Python 2.7 was already installed on my computer.

I then tried to install a different version, Python(x,y) 2.7.6, and the installation was successful. However, I would prefer to use the latest version, Python(x,y) 2.7.3. I am unable to determine what went wrong during the uninstallation process. I followed the standard procedure for program removal: Control Panel -> Programs -> Remove Program.

Could someone please provide any insights or suggestions to resolve this issue?

Thank you in advance,
Stefano

### Solution:

I had a similar experience when trying to install Python(x,y) after previously installing Enthought. Here are the steps I took to resolve the issue:

1. **Uninstall Python and Related Software:**
   - Open the Control Panel.
   - Go to Programs and Features (or Add/Remove Programs).
   - Uninstall both Enthought and Python(x,y).

2. **Delete Relevant Files:**
   - Navigate to `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\` and delete all files and folders related to Python and any third-party software like Enthought.

3. **Remove Environment Variables:**
   - Open the System Properties (right-click on Computer, select Properties, then Advanced system settings, and click on Environment Variables).
   - Remove any environment variables related to Python from both the User and System variables, particularly the `Path` variable.

4. **Delete Registry Keys:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.
   - Navigate to and delete the following keys:
     - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Python\`
     - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Python\`
   - Additionally, search for and delete any other registry keys with the prefix `py` that may have been created by third-party Python software.

After performing these steps, restart your computer and attempt to install Python(x,y) 2.7.3 again. This should resolve the issue.
