Whereas most work to date has focused on the physical layer 
of quantum cryptography – e.g. the modulation, transmission, 
and detection of single photons – our own research effort aims 
to  build  QKD  networks.  As  such,  it  is  oriented  to  a  large 
extent  towards  novel  protocols  and  architectures  for  highly-
secure  communications  across  a  heterogenous  variety  of 
underlying  kinds  of  QKD  links.  See  [18]  for  rationale  and 
details of our research plan. 
Our  security  model  is  the  cryptographic  Virtual  Private 
Network (VPN). Conventional VPNs use both public-key and 
symmetric  cryptography 
to  achieve  confidentiality  and 
authentication/integrity.  Public-key  mechanisms  support  key 
exchange  or  agreement,  and  authenticate  the  endpoints. 
Symmetric  mechanisms  (e.g.  3DES,  SHA1)  provide  traffic 
confidentiality and integrity. Thus VPN systems can provide 
confidentiality  and authentication / integrity  without trusting 
the public network interconnecting the VPN sites. 
In  our  work,  existing  VPN  key  agreement  primitives  are 
augmented  or  completely  replaced  by  keys  provided  by 
quantum cryptography. The remainder of the VPN construct 
is left unchanged; see Fig. 2. Thus our QKD-secured network 
is fully compatible with conventional Internet hosts, routers, 
firewalls, and so forth. 
At  time  of  writing,  we  are  slightly  over  one  year  into  a 
projected five-year effort to build the full DARPA Quantum 
Network. In our first year, we have built a complete quantum 
cryptographic link, and a QKD protocol engine and working 
suite  of  QKD  protocols,  and  have 
this 
cryptographic  substrate  into  an  IPsec-based  Virtual  Private 
Network.  This  entire  system  has  been  continuously 
operational  since  December  2002,  and  we  are  now  in  the 
process of characterizing its behavior and tuning it.

In coming years, we plan to build a second link based on two-
photon  entanglement,  and  to  build  various  forms  of  end-to-
end networks for QKD across a variety of kinds of links. We 
expect  the  majority  of  our  links  to  be  implemented  in  dark 
fiber but some may also be implemented in free space, either 
in the lab or outdoors. Section 8 describes our plans in brief 
form. 
4.  THE PHYSICAL LAYER  
Fig. 3 highlights the major features of our weak-coherent link. 
As  shown,  the  transmitter  at  Alice  sends  single  photons  by 
means  of  a  very  highly  attenuated  laser  pulse  at  1550  nm. 
Each  of  these  photons  passes  through  a  Mach-Zehnder 
interferometer at Alice which is randomly modulated to one 
of four phases, thus encoding both a basis and a value in that 
photon’s  self  interference.  The  receiver  at  Bob  contains 
another  Mach-Zehnder  interferometer,  randomly  modulated 
to one of two phases to select a basis. The received photons 
pass  through  Bob’s  interferometer  to  strike  one  of  the  two 
thermo-electrically cooled single-photon detectors and hence 
to present a received value. Alice also transmits bright pulses 
at 1300 nm, multiplexed over the same fiber, to send timing 
and framing information to Bob. 
Figs. 4-6 illustrate the basic mechanism underlying our phase-
encoding  scheme  for  conveying  qubits.  As  shown,  Alice 
contains an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., an 
interferometer  in  which  the  two  arms  have  different  delays. 
Bob  contains  a  similar  interferometer;  in  fact,  certain 
dimensions of the two interferometers must be kept identical 
to within a fraction of the QKD photon’s wavelength, i.e., a 
fraction of 1550 nm. We have labeled the various paths that a 
photon  can  follow  through  these  interferometers  for  ease  of 
discussion in the following paragraphs. 
Fig.  5  shows  how  a  single  photon  behaves  as  its  pulse 
proceeds from the 1550 nm QKD source at Alice towards the 
pair of detectors at Bob. Here one should visualize the photon 
as a wave rather than as a particle. Thus it follows both paths 
of each interferometer rather than having to choose a  single 
path.  Not  surprisingly,  the  part  of  the  photon  pulse  that 
follows the shorter arm of an interferometer emerges sooner 
than that part of the pulse that takes the longer arm. Reading 
from the left of Fig. 5, we see a single photon pulse emitted 
from  the  QKD  source.  It  follows  both  arms  in  Alice’s 
interferometer  and  the  part  that  follows  the  longer  path 
(labeled LA) begins to lag behind that which takes the shorter 
path  (SA).  These  two  halves  are  combined  at  at  the  50  /  50 
coupler  before  they  leave  Alice  and  travel  as  two  distinct 
pulses through the telco fiber loop. 
Once  this  double-pulse  photon  reaches  the  interferometer  at 
Bob,  it  once  again  takes  both  paths  through  Bob.  Thus  the 
part of the double pulse that takes the top path (long path) will 
be delayed relative to that which follows the shorter, bottom 
path.  
Fig.  6  shows  how  Bob’s  50  /  50  coupler  (just  before  the 
detectors)  combines  the  resulting  double  pulses.  If  the 
interferometers are set correctly, the leading pulse in the upper

train will align more or less precisely with the trailing pulse in 
the bottom train, and the two amplitudes will be summed. The 
right  part  of  the  diagram  shows  the  resulting  combined 
waveform at the 50 / 50 coupler just in front of Bob’s pair of 
QKD detectors. 
We are now, finally, in a position to explain exactly how ‘0’ 
and  ‘1’  values  are  sent  via  QKD  pulses  between  Alice  and 
Bob.  As  we  mentioned,  this  central  peak  emerged  from  the 
combination of double pulse assuming that Alice’s and Bob’s 
interferometers were aligned more or less precisely. This is in 
fact  where  the  (basis,  value)  modulation  enters  the  picture. 
First, we need a few basic facts from optics: 
•  When a light ray is incident on a surface and the material 
on  the  other  side  of  the  surface  has  a  higher  index  of 
refraction (i.e. a lower speed of light), then the reflected 
light ray is phase-shifted by exactly half a wavelength.
