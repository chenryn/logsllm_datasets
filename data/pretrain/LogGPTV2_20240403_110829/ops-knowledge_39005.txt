User: Suppose you need to configure and start Docker containers on several different servers to run a web application. Please provide a detailed procedure.
Assistant: The following are the detailed steps to configure and start the Docker container: 1. Install Docker on each server. 2. Create a Docker image on a server and upload it to the Docker repository. 3. Download the Docker image on another server. 4. Create Docker containers and start them on each server. You can use the docker run command to create and start a container. For example: docker run -d -p 80:80 --name web-app1 <image_name> Among them, <image_name> is the image name uploaded to the Docker warehouse in advance. 5. Configure the load balancer to route network traffic to each web application's Docker container. Can be configured using Nginx or other load balancers. 6. Verify that the web application is running properly on each server and test the availability of the application through the load balancer. The above steps should be able to successfully configure and start Docker containers on several different servers to run a web application.
