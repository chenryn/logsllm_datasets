## 1. Introduction to Public Warning Systems in LTE Networks

### Purpose
- To alert the public to disasters and emergencies.

### Global PWS Systems
- **ETWS (Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System)**
- **KPAS (Korea Public Alert System)**
- **EU-ALERT (European Union Alert System)**
- **CMAS (Commercial Mobile Alert System) in the USA**

### Notable Example
- **Hawaiian Missile Alert (January 2018)**
  - A false missile alert was mistakenly sent, causing widespread panic.
  - The incident highlighted the importance of secure and reliable warning systems.

## 2. Vulnerabilities in the LTE Protocol

### Key Vulnerabilities
1. **Unencrypted and Unprotected Warning Messages:**
   - Warning messages over the air are not encrypted or integrity-protected.
2. **Lack of Authentication:**
   - User Equipment (UE) does not authenticate the base station during reselection, making it vulnerable to fake base stations.

### Attack Vector
- An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities by setting up a fake LTE base station and broadcasting false warning messages.

## 3. Triggering the Vulnerability

### Building a Fake LTE Network
- **Hardware:**
  - USRP B210
  - ThinkPad
- **Software:**
  - srsLTE / srsENB

#### Steps to Build a Fake LTE Base Station
1. **Act Like a Normal Base Station:**
   - Configure the srsENB to mimic a legitimate base station.
   - Use the configuration files in `srsLTE/config/file/` for setup.
2. **Obtain Necessary Parameters:**
   - Use the LTE Discovery App to get the required parameters.
   - Configure the System Information Blocks (SIBs) as follows:
     - **SIB Type 1:** Scheduling information
     - **SIB Type 2:** Common and shared channel information
     - **SIB Type 3-5:** Cell re-selection information
     - **SIB Type 6-8:** Cell re-selection information for UTRA, GERAN, and CDMA2000
     - **SIB Type 9:** Home eNB identifier
     - **SIB Type 10-12:** ETWS primary and secondary notifications, EU-Alert, KPAS, and CMAS notifications

### Forging the ETWS Message
- **Components Involved:**
  - **SIB 10:** Primary Notification
  - **SIB 11:** Secondary Notification
  - **Paging:** ETWS indication
  - **SIB 1:** Schedule SIB 10 and SIB 11

#### ETWS Primary Notification
- **Content:**
  - The primary notification message cannot contain specific message content.
  - Main source code to send the ETWS primary notification.

#### ETWS Secondary Notification
- **Content:**
  - Supports message segmentation.
  - Supports GSM-7 and UCS-2 character encoding standards.
  - Source code to send the ETWS secondary notification.

### Not Just Warning Messages
- **Custom Content:**
  - Set the Message Identifier to 0x1104 instead of 0x1102.
  - No loud alarm, just mild bells.
  - Warning messages can be disguised as spam, containing advertisements, phishing sites, or fraud messages.

### Device Responses
- **Google Pixel:**
  - Earthquake warning message in English and Chinese.
  - Spam message containing a phishing site.
  - Spam message containing a fraud phone number.

- **iPhone:**
  - Different models may react differently.
  - The tested iPhone did not respond to the primary ETWS warning but responded to the secondary ETWS warning.
  - Test PLMN: MCC: 001, MNC: 01

## 4. Conclusion

### Potential Risks
- **False Alerts:**
  - A false alert like "WARNING: Magnitude 10 Earthquake Is Coming in One Minute" can cause serious population panic.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Verification of Authenticity:**
  - Verify the authenticity of the base station.
  - Add an authentication procedure after cell selection.
- **Message Integrity:**
  - Add a digital signature to the broadcast system information.
  - Network signs the PWS messages using a security algorithm like K-SIG.

### Security Algorithm
- **K-SIG:**
  - **System Info**
  - **Time Counter**
  - **Digital Signature**
  - **Protected System Info**
  - **LSBs of Time Count**
