User: Is there any way to queue up document list API requests and handle them asynchronously (similar to the google app engine async urlfetch requests)?
I could conceivably copy/rewrite a lot of the client request modification logic in DocsClient around a urlfetch request, but I'd rather avoid that if there's some other method already available.
The target environment is google app engine, and I'm aware of the async datastore APIs.
EDIT
I've now implemented basic functionality on DocsClient.request to accept a callback kwarg, so any higher-level client request will use async urlfetch and call the callback function with the result of the call.
Assistant: Currently the Documents List API library for Python (The GData Library) is rigidly synchronous. One solution would be to serialize the requests as tasks for a task queue and run them later, but the library itself won't help, I'm afraid.
