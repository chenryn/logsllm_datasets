User: What's the best cross-platform way to get file creation and modification dates/times, that works on both Linux and Windows?
Assistant: os.stat returns a named tuple with st_mtime and st_ctime attributes. The modification time is st_mtime on both platforms; unfortunately, on Windows, ctime means "creation time", whereas on POSIX it means "change time". I'm not aware of any way to get the creation time on POSIX platforms.
