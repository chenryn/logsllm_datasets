Is there any reason this (snippet below) exists? the rfc does not require
implementations to be identical, but that the responses be equivalent.
                // check HTTP method requirement
                if ($requiredMethods = $route->getMethods()) {
                    // HEAD and GET are equivalent as per RFC
                    if ('HEAD' === $method = $this->context->getMethod()) {
                        $method = 'GET';
                    }
                    if (!in_array($method, $requiredMethods)) {
                        $this->allow = array_merge($this->allow, $requiredMethods);
                        continue;
                    }
                }
Worse, in 2.3, what i am currently using (could be it's the same in higher
versions), the router debug will actually not take this into consideration and
report that the routing works as per the user routing definition
There could be valid reasons to not want to execute the same code for GET and
HEAD - f.e. avoid expensive hydration in exploratory HEAD calls.
If the Content-Length defined in 14.13 is a factor here, that is expressed
with SHOULD, not MUST, so no reason to impose this on the user.
