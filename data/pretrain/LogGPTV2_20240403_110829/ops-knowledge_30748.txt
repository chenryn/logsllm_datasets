User: I'm currently writing a Gnome Panel Applet in Python. Everything is working fine as long as I don't try to actually add it to the panel (running it in a window works).
When trying to add it to a panel it crashes and I have no idea why, because I can't see the error trace.
Is there a simple way to log the output of a Gnome Applet to a file so I can find the problem?
Assistant: stdout and stderr of applications started via X or one of its children are written to ~/.xsession-errors if not redirected.
