ABSTRACT
In this paper, we propose an e(cid:14)cient method for extracting
simple low-degree equations (e.g. quadratic ones) in addi-
tion to the linear ones, obtainable from the original cube
attack by Dinur and Shamir at EUROCRYPT 2009. This
extended cube attack can be successfully applied even to
cryptosystems in which the original cube attack may fail due
to the attacker’s inability in (cid:12)nding su(cid:14)ciently many inde-
pendent linear equations. As an application of our extended
method, we exhibit a side channel cube attack against the
PRESENT block cipher using the Hamming weight leakage
model. Our side channel attack improves upon the previ-
ous work of Yang, Wang and Qiao at CANS 2009 from two
aspects. First, we use the Hamming weight leakage mod-
el which is a more relaxed leakage assumption, supported
by many previously known practical results on side channel
attacks, compared to the more challenging leakage assump-
tion that the adversary has access to the \exact" value of
the internal state bits as used by Yang et al. Thanks to
applying the extended cube method, our attack has also a
reduced complexity compared to that of Yang et al. Name-
ly, for PRESENT-80 (80-bit key variant) as considered by
Yang et al., our attack has a time complexity 216 and data
complexity of about 213 chosen plaintexts; whereas, that of
Yang et al. has time complexity of 232 and needs about 215
chosen plaintexts. Furthermore, our method directly applies

INTRODUCTION
The cube attack, put forth by Dinur and Shamir at EU-
ROCRYPT 2009 [16], is a generic type of algebraic attacks
that may be applied against any cryptosytem, provided that
the attacker has access to a bit of information that can be
represented by a \low-degree" multivariate polynomial over
GF(2) of the secret and public variables of the target cryp-
tosytem. Dinur and Shamir in [16] compared the cube attack
to some of the previously known similar techniques and s-
tated that the attack generalizes and improves some of those
methods. As some of the previously known similar attacks,
which exploit the vulnerability of ciphers with low-degree
polynomials, we refer to [36, 35].
The cube attack aims to derive low-degree (especially lin-
ear) implicit equations that can be exploited for constructing
distinguishers, e.g. [4], and/or key recovery attacks, e.g. [16,
4]. An interesting feature of the cube attack is that it on-
ly requires a black-box access to a target cryptosystem and
may be applied even if only a few output bits can be accessed
by an adversary. When using the original cube attack [16,
37], one tries to derive independent linear equations over
secret variables of the cryptosystem. This system of linear
296
equations can be easily solved to recover the value of the se-
cret variables by using the well-known Gaussian elimination
method.
This Paper. Our work is motivated by the observation
that in most cases, for properly designed cryptographic algo-
rithms, it may not be possible to extract a su(cid:14)cient number
of independent ‘linear’ equations using the (preprocessing
phase of the) original cube attack. In fact various potential
extensions of the cube attack were suggested to be consid-
ered for future research in [16]. One of the methods to gen-
eralize the original cube attack, left in [16] for future work
without further elaboration, is that one should try to (cid:12)nd
and employ some additional low degree nonlinear equations,
e.g. equations of degree 2 or 3, provided that the system of e-
quations is simple (sparse and low degree) and solvable using
existing methods. In this paper we elaborate this idea and
develop an extension of the cube attack to extract such (low
degree) nonlinear equations. To demonstrate the applica-
tion of our extended cube method, we provide a side channel
cube attack against the PRESENT block cipher [10], which
improves upon the previous work of Yang, Wang and Qiao
at CANS 2009.
Side Channel Cube Attack.
In attempting to apply
cube attacks to block ciphers, the main problem is that
the degree of the polynomial representing a ciphertext bit
grows exponentially with the number of rounds in the cipher.
Hence, the cube attack usually becomes ine(cid:11)ective after a
few rounds if one considers only the standard attack mod-
el that is used in the well-known statistical attacks, such
as the Di(cid:11)erential and Linear attacks. Nevertheless, con-
sidering the practical implementations of the block cipher,
especially in resource limited systems such as smart cards,
there is a stronger attack model, namely the side channel
attack model, where the adversary is given more power by
having access to some \limited " information leaked about the
internal state of the cipher. This information leakage can be
via physical side channels, such as timing, electrical power
consumption, electromagnetic radiation, probing, etc.
We note that the idea of combining algebraic cryptanal-
ysis with side channel attacks was already introduced by
Bogdanov, Kizhvatov and Pyshkin at INDOCRYPT 2008
[8], and also recently investigated in several other works such
as [33, 17, 37]. Compared to the recent side channel cube
attack of Yang et al. [37], our attack in this paper o(cid:11)ers two
improvements: it is based on a more relaxed leakage model;
namely, the Hamming weight leakage model, and it has a
better (i.e. reduced) complexity as well. The improved com-
plexity is due to applying the extension of the cube attack,
to derive simple low degree nonlinear (especially quadratic)
equations, which itself is of an independent interest, as the
primary contribution of our paper.
Comparing Side Channel Cube attack of [37] with
Our attack. The leakage model used by Yang et al. [37]
assumes that adversary has access to the exact value of some
of the internal state bits after each round. We note that ob-
taining the exact value of the internal state bits in practice
will require a probe station that allows the attacker to mon-
itor the value of a speci(cid:12)c bit position in the internal state
during the encryption or decryption process. This implies
an intrusive physical measurement and is known to involve
a wide range of di(cid:14)culties such as penetrating the device to
access its internals and guessing which bit position is being
recorded. To relax the leakage model, in contrast, we as-
sume the Hamming weight leakage as a more common side
channel leakage model, e.g. see [2, 7, 13, 14, 28].
From time and data complexity viewpoints, we show that,
for PRESENT-80 (80-bit key variant of PRESENT), our
attack has time complexity of 216 and data complexity of
about 213 chosen plaintexts; whereas, the attack of Yang et
al. has time complexity of 232 and needs about 215 chosen
plaintexts. Also our method directly applies to PRESENT-
128 (i.e. 128-bit key variant) with time complexity of 264 and
the same data complexity of 213 chosen plaintexts, and is the
only attack in this model considered against PRESENT-128.
We should stress that both of these side channel cube at-
tacks against PRESENT, provided by Yang et al.
in [37]
and our attack in this paper, need clean leaked data values
(i.e. the exact value of some internal state bits in the case
of [37] and the Hamming weight of the internal state in our
case). Hence, to the best of our knowledge these are only
of a theoretical interest, at the moment, and do not directly
impose any real threat to the security of PRESENT imple-
mentations in practice, where the side channel information
measurements (e.g. power traces, EM radiations, or timing)
are almost always noisy. We refer to [17, 33] for some relat-
ed discussions on the possibility of handling the noisy data
obtained from side channels when combined with the alge-
braic attacks. We note that, the current issue is that these
methods are very sensitive to measurement noise levels and
can only handle very low error rates than what may happen
in practice.
Organization of the Paper. In Section 2 and 4, respec-
tively, we review the cube attack and the construction of the
PRESENT block cipher. Section 3 and 5 contain the main
contribution of this paper, where we provide the notion of
an extended cube for extracting nonlinear equation of low
degree and the details of the improved side channel cube
attack on PRESENT. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2. A REVIEW ON THE CUBE ATTACK
The main point of the cube attack is that, the multivariate
\master" polynomial p(v1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) , vm, k1,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) , kn), representing
an output bit of a cryptosystem over GF(2) of secret vari-
ables ki (key bits) and public variables vi (i.e. plaintext or
initial values), may induce algebraic equations of lower de-
grees, in particular linear equations. The cube attack pro-
vides a method to derive such lower degree (especially linear)
equations, given the master polynomial only as a black-box
which can be evaluated on the secret and public variables.
Let’s ignore the distinction between the secret and public
variables’ notations and denote all of them by xi,(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) , xℓ,
where ℓ = m + n. Let I (cid:18) f1, ..., ℓg be a subset of the
variable indexes, and tI denote a monomial term containing
