## Abstract

In this paper, we propose an efficient method for extracting low-degree non-linear equations (e.g., quadratic ones) in addition to the linear equations obtainable from the original cube attack introduced by Dinur and Shamir at EUROCRYPT 2009. This extended cube attack can be successfully applied even to cryptosystems where the original cube attack may fail due to the attacker's inability to find a sufficient number of independent linear equations. As an application of our extended method, we present a side-channel cube attack against the PRESENT block cipher using the Hamming weight leakage model. Our side-channel attack improves upon the previous work of Yang, Wang, and Qiao at CANS 2009 in two aspects. First, we use the Hamming weight leakage model, which is a more relaxed leakage assumption supported by many practical results on side-channel attacks, compared to the more challenging assumption that the adversary has access to the exact value of internal state bits. Second, thanks to the extended cube method, our attack has reduced complexity. For PRESENT-80, our attack has a time complexity of \(2^{16}\) and data complexity of about \(2^{13}\) chosen plaintexts, whereas the attack by Yang et al. has a time complexity of \(2^{32}\) and requires about \(2^{15}\) chosen plaintexts. Furthermore, our method directly applies to PRESENT-128 with a time complexity of \(2^{64}\) and the same data complexity of \(2^{13}\) chosen plaintexts.

## 1. Introduction

The cube attack, proposed by Dinur and Shamir at EUROCRYPT 2009 [16], is a generic algebraic attack applicable to any cryptosystem, provided the attacker has access to information represented by a low-degree multivariate polynomial over GF(2) of the secret and public variables. The cube attack aims to derive low-degree (especially linear) implicit equations that can be exploited for constructing distinguishers or key recovery attacks. An interesting feature of the cube attack is that it only requires black-box access to the target cryptosystem and can be applied even if only a few output bits are accessible to the adversary.

### Motivation and Contribution

Our work is motivated by the observation that, for well-designed cryptographic algorithms, it may not be possible to extract a sufficient number of independent linear equations using the original cube attack. In this paper, we elaborate on the idea of finding and employing additional low-degree non-linear equations (e.g., quadratic or cubic) to generalize the cube attack. We develop an extension of the cube attack to extract such low-degree non-linear equations. To demonstrate the application of our extended cube method, we provide a side-channel cube attack against the PRESENT block cipher, which improves upon the previous work of Yang, Wang, and Qiao at CANS 2009.

### Side-Channel Cube Attack

Applying cube attacks to block ciphers is challenging because the degree of the polynomial representing a ciphertext bit grows exponentially with the number of rounds. Hence, the cube attack usually becomes ineffective after a few rounds under the standard attack model. However, in the side-channel attack model, the adversary has access to limited information leaked about the internal state of the cipher, such as timing, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, or probing. 

Compared to the recent side-channel cube attack by Yang et al. [37], our attack offers two improvements: it uses the more relaxed Hamming weight leakage model and has better (reduced) complexity. The improved complexity is due to the extraction of simple low-degree non-linear (especially quadratic) equations, which is the primary contribution of our paper.

### Comparison with Previous Work

Yang et al. [37] assume that the adversary has access to the exact value of some internal state bits after each round, which requires intrusive physical measurements. In contrast, we assume the Hamming weight leakage model, a more common and less intrusive side-channel leakage model. For PRESENT-80, our attack has a time complexity of \(2^{16}\) and data complexity of about \(2^{13}\) chosen plaintexts, whereas the attack by Yang et al. has a time complexity of \(2^{32}\) and needs about \(2^{15}\) chosen plaintexts. Our method also directly applies to PRESENT-128 with a time complexity of \(2^{64}\) and the same data complexity of \(2^{13}\) chosen plaintexts.

## 2. A Review of the Cube Attack

The cube attack focuses on the multivariate "master" polynomial \( p(v_1, \ldots, v_m, k_1, \ldots, k_n) \) representing an output bit of a cryptosystem over GF(2) with secret variables \( k_i \) (key bits) and public variables \( v_i \) (plaintext or initial values). The goal is to derive lower-degree (especially linear) equations from this master polynomial, given only black-box access to its evaluation. Let \( x_1, \ldots, x_{\ell} \) denote all variables, where \( \ell = m + n \). Let \( I \subseteq \{1, \ldots, \ell\} \) be a subset of variable indexes, and let \( t_I \) denote a monomial term containing the variables indexed by \( I \).
