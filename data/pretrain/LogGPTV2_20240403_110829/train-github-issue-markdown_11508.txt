# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I like the shortcut guide feature of powertoys. Helps to remind about the
shortcuts i seem to forget regularly. Though noticed that one the P is not in
the list. Used for managing your screens in case you have multiple screens
active. Suggest to add this one?
