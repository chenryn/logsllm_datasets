### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

I appreciate the Shortcut Guide feature in PowerToys, as it serves as a useful reminder for shortcuts that I often forget. However, I noticed that the shortcut for managing multiple screens (typically involving the "P" key) is not included in the list. This shortcut is particularly helpful when you have multiple monitors active. I suggest adding this shortcut to the guide.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

To implement this enhancement, the following steps could be considered:

1. **Identify the Missing Shortcut**: Determine the exact key combination used for managing multiple screens, such as `Win + P`.
2. **Update the Shortcut List**: Add the identified shortcut to the existing list in the Shortcut Guide.
3. **Documentation and Testing**: Ensure that the new shortcut is accurately documented and thoroughly tested to confirm its functionality and usability.

This addition would enhance the utility of the Shortcut Guide for users with multi-monitor setups.
