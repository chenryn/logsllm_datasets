### Description
Ability to clear or mark task groups as success/failure and have that
propagate to the tasks within that task group. Sometimes there is a need to
adjust the status of tasks within a task group, which can get unwieldy
depending on the number of tasks in that task group. A great quality of life
upgrade, and something that seems like an intuitive feature, would be the
ability to clear or change the status of all tasks at their taskgroup level
through the UI.
### Use case/motivation
In the event a large number of tasks, or a whole task group in this case, need
to be cleared or their status set to success/failure this would be a great
improvement. For example, a manual DAG run triggered through the UI or the API
that has a number of task sensors or tasks that otherwise don't matter for
that DAG run - instead of setting each one as success by hand, doing so for
each task group would be great.
