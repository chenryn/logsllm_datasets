User: How to implement distributed transactions, including which classic distributed transaction protocols?
Assistant: The following methods can be used to implement distributed transactions: 1. Two-phase commit protocol (2PC): that is, in a distributed transaction, all participants need to perform a pre-commit operation under the coordination of the coordinator before confirming the commit and wait The coordinator gives the final commit or rollback command. If the coordinator has precommitted all participants and waited for all participants to confirm the commit, then the transaction will become a consistent state. 2PC is the most basic and common way to realize distributed transactions. 2. Three-phase commit protocol (3PC): In the 2PC protocol, if the coordinator exits abnormally when notifying participants of commit or rollback instructions, the status of the entire distributed system will be uncertain. 3PC is to avoid this from happening. 3. Paxos algorithm: Paxos algorithm is a consensus algorithm based on message passing, which is used to ensure the consistency among multiple nodes in a distributed system. It not only enables distributed transactions, but also consistent state machine replication. 4. Raft algorithm: Raft algorithm is a simpler and more practical distributed consensus algorithm, which is mainly used for consistency problems in distributed systems. Compared with Paxos algorithm, Raft algorithm is easier to understand and implement, so it is also widely used. 5. TCC (Try-Confirm-Cancel) transaction mechanism: The TCC mechanism is a compensatory transaction, that is, when performing an operation, the try operation is executed first, and then the confirm operation is executed. If the confirm operation is successfully executed, the transaction is submitted; if the confirm If the operation fails, execute the cancel operation to roll back. In the TCC mechanism, it is necessary to implement the compensation logic by itself.
