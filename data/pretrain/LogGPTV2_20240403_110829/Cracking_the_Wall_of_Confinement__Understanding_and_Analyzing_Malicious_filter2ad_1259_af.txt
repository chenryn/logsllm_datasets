be factored into the decision to release the domain. When a
domain is sinkholed, sinkhole operators should monitor the
received trafﬁc to determine when malicious trafﬁc ceased to
exist. Rezaeirad et al. [56] have designed a trafﬁc analyzer
to study sinkholed trafﬁc which can be utilized further to
determine when a domain is no longer receiving malicious
trafﬁc. This procedure is especially recommended for domains
related to malware campaigns, such as C&C domains.
For other types of malicious domains, such as carding or
pharmaceutical, we suggest considering three factors before
releasing them. The ﬁrst factor is the popularity of the mali-
cious domain; popular malicious domains are more likely to
be re-registered if they are released preemptively compared
to unpopular ones. Another factor is the domain’s current
trafﬁc; if the domain is still receiving trafﬁc, then it gives an
indicator that it might resume its malicious activity if released
and re-registered. The ﬁnal and crucial factor is the degree of
the domain’s maliciousness; if the domain was involved in a
serious criminal act, such as child abuse, then it is not wise to
risk releasing it. This speciﬁc category of high-risk domains
should be taken down indeﬁnitely and never released back to
the public. Technically, this could be performed by keeping
these domains in the registries’ list of reserved domains,
which will prevent them from being available for purchase
after their expiration. By taking these factors into account the
domain holder can informally decide on the appropriate take-
down duration.
Limitations. It is important to note that the take-down lifecycle
(i.e., sinkhole duration and active duration) is limited by the
“visibility” of PDNS. Therefore, if a domain’s TLD is not
within its daily feed list of supported TLDs zone set, the
accuracy of a seized domain’s lifecycle becomes dependent
on the resolution requests for the domain. In other words, the
accuracy of the duration depends on whether or not resolution
requests occurred and consequently were captured by PDNS
sensors.
Another limitation is that the algorithm in Section III-C
might inaccurately label some domains due to the limited
number of snapshots for each domain in our dataset. However,
the proposed algorithm introduced less than 4% of domains to
our analysis. Therefore, the effect on our study is minimal.
VII. RELATED WORK
Study on domain take-downs. Previous works on domain
take-down mainly focused on the effectiveness (in terms of
the coverage of taken-down domains, malicious domain active
duration, etc.) of the take-down procedures. Hutching et al.
[42] conducted user interviews to reveal
the expertise of
different parties (e.g., law enforcement, take-down services)
engaged in domain take-down. Moore et al. [51] studied the
domain take-down speed for multiple types of cybercrime,
such as phishing and child abuse. In particular, they examined
the impact of domain take-down on phishing by analyzing the
malicious active duration and the number of visitors [50]. They
concluded that domain take-down can not completely mitigate
phishing. Nadji et al. [53] investigated the malicious domain
coverage of botnet take-down actions and proposed a system
to identify the missed malicious domains during botnet take-
down. Asghari et al. [39] analyzed logs of Conﬁcker sinkholes
and measured the effectiveness of the sinkholing effort carried
against this botnet. Rezaeirad et al. [56] studied the victims
of remote access trojans (RAT) by sinkholing RAT servers.
Kuhrer et al. [45] investigated the effectiveness of malware
blacklists by identifying the sinkhole servers in the blacklist.
To the best of our knowledge, we conducted the ﬁrst systematic
study to provide a ﬁne-grained view of the domain take-down
procedure (e.g., sinkhole conﬁguration, lifecycle) and have
revealed multiple weaknesses of it.
DNS misconﬁguration. Pappas et al. [54] revealed that DNS
misconﬁguration is widespread, which degrades the reliability
of DNS. Jiang et al. [43] found that a malicious domain could
remain resolvable due to the outdated data in upper-level DNS.
Liu et al. [48] presented security threats related to dangling
DNS records, such as domain hijacking. Vissers et al.
[59]
discussed possible scenarios in which the domain could be
hijacked through their nameservers. Similarly, Borgolte et al.
14
[40] showed a scenario for a temporary domain hijacking
through their stale A records provided by cloud services.
We investigated the DNS misconﬁguration issue of sinkhole
servers and its impact on the domain take-down procedure.
Domain abuse. Numerous studies have looked into abuse in
the DNS ecosystem. Korczynski et al. [44] investigated abuse
in the domains registered under the new gTLD. Visser et al.
[60] studied the malicious campaigns in .eu TLD. Recently,
some studies have investigated domain re-registration patterns
and their relation to domain abuse. Hao et al. [41] found that
spammers commonly re-register expired domains. Lauinger
et al.
[46] discussed domains’ lifetime and showed the
variations in how the duration of some stages is implemented
differently by registrars. Moore et al. [52] found that failed
bank websites have been re-registered and likely used for
malicious purposes. Lever et al. [47] studied the maliciousness
of re-registered domains after they expired and revealed their
malicious behavior. Miramirkhani et al.
[49] studied domain
drop-catching services and found that there is a tendency to
reuse malicious domains. In contrast to previous studies, our
study revealed the maliciousness of take-down domain re-
registration and explored its possible root causes.
VIII. CONCLUSION
This paper comprises the ﬁrst systematic study on domain
take-down to understand this process and investigate its secu-
rity and reliability. We have highlighted the ability to utilize
WHOIS information and PDNS data to determine taken-down
domains and proﬁle their take-down lifecycles. In analyzing
625,692 take-down domains and their lifecycles, our research
sheds new light on the take-down operations and highlights
security-critical observations about sinkhole operators. This
helps in identifying a set of best practices important for
avoiding the loopholes in these services and enhancing their
effectiveness against cybercrime.
