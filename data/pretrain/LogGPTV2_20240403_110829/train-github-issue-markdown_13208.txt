Hi,
I'm trying to get the subsub menu to work.  
I have applied the following fixes:
1: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9758587/twitter-bootstrap-multilevel-
dropdown-menu  
2: #5278
But the sub sub menu is not working yet.  
The patch 2 fixed the submenu and clicking on the sub menu.
patch 1 fixed that the sub sub menu will open well, but still not be enable to
click on it.
What to do?
