**ATT&CK ID:** T1574.007  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Path Interception via PATH Environment Variable

**Description:**
Adversaries may execute malicious payloads by manipulating environment variables used to load libraries. Specifically, they can place a malicious program in a directory that appears earlier in the list of directories stored in the `PATH` environment variable. When Windows searches for an executable (e.g., from a script or command line), it follows the `PATH` listing sequentially. By placing their payload in an earlier directory, adversaries ensure that their malicious program is executed instead of the intended legitimate one.
