### Version
2.5.16
### Reproduction link
https://codesandbox.io/s/github/weihongyu12/vue-typescript-demo
### Steps to reproduce
Uses @vue/cli to build the project. The configuration uses TypeScript.
However, in the process of using, in the `methods`, there is no access to the
`computed`. The construction does not exist on type 'Vue'.
        {{ item }}
    import Vue from 'vue';
    export default Vue.extend({
      name : 'Picker',
      props: {
        columns: {
          type: Array,
          default: [],
        },
        show: {
          type: Boolean ,
          default: false,
        },
      },
      computed: {
        pickerList(): Array {
          const arr = [];
          const columns: any = this.columns;
          for (const item of columns) {
            arr.push(item.title);
          }
          return arr;
        },
        pickerMap() : Map {
          const map = new Map();
          const columns: any = this.columns;
          for (const item of columns) {
            map.set(item.title, item.id);
          }
          return map;
        },
      },
      methods: {
        onConfirm(value: string): void {
          const resumeId = this.pickerMap.get(value);  // Property 'pickerMap' does not exist on type 'Vue'.
          this.$emit('confirm', resumeId);
        },
      },
    });
### What is expected?
I don't know if it's because of my writing, or because of the configuration
that caused me this error. I wrote the code based on the official document. I
believe it can be build successfully.
### What is actually happening?
When I run `npm run build`, an error Property 'pickerMap' does not exist on
type 'Vue'. The complete prompt is as follows:
    ERROR in E:/project/demo/src/components/picker.vue
    44:29 Property 'pickerMap' does not exist on type 'Vue'.
         42 | methods: {
         43 | onConfirm(value: string): void {
       > 44 | const resumeId = this.pickerMap.get(value);
            | ^
         45 | this.$emit('confirm', resumeId);
         46 | },
         47 | },

I do not know of any reason for this error. It is imperative that I have a
friend to help me solve this error, but I hope that the official can speed up
the improvement of TypeScript's documentation, because I believe TypeScript
will become popular. Thank you.
