4. THE IMPORTANCE OF SEMANTICS FOR
ORGANIZATIONS
Today, integration is a top priority for many European and worldwide
enterprises. The European community alone is investing, through the
Seventh Framework Program, more that €200 million on research involving
inter-enterprise interoperability and semantics. Most organizations have
already realized that the use of Semantic Web technologies is a promising
candidate solution to support cross-organizational cooperation for SME that
operate in dynamically changing work environments. Semantic Web
technologies are more and more considered as a key technology to resolve
the problems of interoperability and integration within the heterogeneous
world of ubiquitously interconnected systems with respect to the nature of
components, standards, data formats, protocols, etc. Moreover, we also
believe that Semantic Web technologies can facilitate not only the discovery
of heterogeneous components and data integration, but also the
communication between individuals.
Semantic inter-enterprise interoperability is the key for the
implementation of the idea of a knowledge-based economy where networks
of enterprises (and SME in particular) can gain advantages from the
peculiarities of the productive European fabric (many small companies,
highly specialized, closely connected with each other, highly flexible thanks
to the diffusion of knowledge and very skilled people in the whole fabric).
The world-class competitiveness of enterprises strongly depends, in the
future, on their ability to rapidly set-up, and maintain, virtual, networked
enterprise structures. Novel technologies for interoperability within and
between enterprises need to emerge to radically solve a problem that has not
been sufficiently addressed by the research community before. In fact,
managing the semantics of business-to-business interaction may be the most
challenging task in integrated e-business value chains, and there is more and
more evidence that Semantic Web technology has the potential to actually
mitigate such problems.
4.1 Ontology management Systems
In the previous section, we saw that ontologies are the latest
technological innovation that can enable inter-enterprises to establish
dynamic working networks. Therefore, to provide a holistic
management, there is the need to support the entire lifecycle of inter-
enterprise ontologies, including ontology creation, storage, search,
query, reuse, maintenance, and integration (Li, Thompson et al. 2003).
Modern organizations are realizing that shared ontologies and
understanding is fundamental to create the next generation of networked
inter- and intra-enterprises (Wache, Voegele et al. 2001). Shared
understanding is a basis for communication, coordination, and collaboration
between people and interoperability between systems (Vernadat 1993). It
should be clear to the reader that interoperability is not only a concern for
software applications and hardware platforms but also for human resource
enterprise (i.e., employees, managers, and individuals in general).
In the near future, an increasing range of inter-enterprise applications will
be requiring an Ontology Management System (OMS) that helps externalize
ontological information for a variety of purposes in a declarative way. Such
management systems provide ontology independence to applications and
people in a similar way that database management systems provide data
independence. The primary objective of an OMS is to provide a full and
efficient control over management activities for ontological information by
externalizing them from application programs. One of the pragmatic
challenges for ontology management system research is how to create the
missing technology pieces, and to engineer them with existing results from
prior research work to provide for a holistic management system (Harrison
and Chan 2005).
OMS needs to address a wide range of problems: ontology models,
ontology base design, query languages, programming interfaces, query
processing and optimization, federation of knowledge sources, caching and
indexing, transaction support, distributed system support, and security
support, to name a few (Lee and Goodwin 2005). An inter-enterprise
ontology management system provides a mechanism to deal with ontological
information at an appropriate level of abstraction. By using programming
interfaces and query languages the ontology management system provides
application programs, can manipulate and query ontologies without the need
to know their details or reimplement the semantics of standard ontology
languages.
4.2 Challenge
Networked enterprises made available a wealth of information to
many people worldwide: blogs, wikis, web sites, collaborative and
social networks, etc. This has unleashed numerous resources and
possibilities. Since the volume of information that is being generated
and made available is overwhelming, current software systems are not
prepared to deal with this. Nowadays, enterprises have been
unprepared for environments where so much information is being
generated every year. Since business success often depends on
decision makers having timely access to the right information and
knowledge (Vernadat 1993), the need arises for systems that are able
to provide this knowledge. It is our firm belief that given the growing
role of the internet on human and business activity and the sheer
growth in the volume of available information, there will be a growing
demand for infrastructures such as OMS.
The challenge for inter-enterprises is that there is simply too much
content being generated for a human to follow it. Let us illustrate this
challenge expressed by one of our partners located in Spain, Arcelor Mittal,
the world’s number one steel company, with 330,000 employees in more
than 60 countries. Arcelor Mittal produces flat steel products of high quality,
according to the customer’s expectations many different technical demands
have to be fulfilled: innovative and adequate product, research process
definition, excellent plant technology, suitable plant maintenance, good
quality raw materials, suitable automation systems, proper set points for
control systems, etc.
Arcelor Mittal employees, with different profiles have gathered much
information/knowledge during many years developing new products,
designing and carrying on processes to manufacture those products,
investigating cause and effect relationships regarding quality defects and
process disturbances. All this knowledge is continuously being formalized in
different formats and applications, which in many cases contribute to extract
new knowledge. Unfortunately all this information is very often limited to a
small circle of persons or to an individual. As a consequence, many times
people reinvent known relationships because of poor exchange of
information inside the company or because experienced people left the
company. The knowledge acquired and put in operation by these individuals
in their everyday tasks, should be extended and contrasted with that of other
group of individuals or enterprise entities who are operating in a different
context.
Search and taxonomies are not the answer!!!
Search is not the answer, because people and work groups do not
know that they need to search. Additionally, relying exclusively on
existing “top-down” taxonomies is not the answer. If a taxonomy
already exists then projects must also already exist, and if projects
exist then there are existing procedures that enable people to know
about them and contribute to them. We are interested in discovering
and mining emerging ideas, new projects and thoughts within the
organization, and how to bring together the team that can make them
happen. This means that we are interested in “the ontology of
tomorrow”, which is something that has not been formally built yet.
5. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS EDITION
Dealing in this edition with The Semantic Web: Real-World Applications
we had to face two critical challenges: From the one hand we had to give
answers to “thirsty” people for practical issue, delivering a state-of-the-art
edition for the domain and from the other hand we had to give at a glance
our perception for the required efforts towards adoption of Semantic Web
technologies to the real world contexts. We decided to organize the contents
of the book in six general pillars that represent six excellent contents for the
Semantic Web technologies exploitation. The following list provides a
summary:
• Semantic Enterprises
• Finance and Government
• Healthcare and life Sciences
• Education
• Business and Customer Management
• Enterprise Management and Security
The twelve chapters of this edition contribute in three directions:
• Highlight the full range of business and technological issues that
must be addressed in every real world application of Semantic Web
Technologies. The variety of the contexts, discussed in the book (e.g.
finance, health, government, and education domains) gives the reader
the opportunity to see the “forest” of Semantic Web adoption. In fact
reader is able to realize underlying methodological approaches, key
business issues, decisions related to the selection of technologies and
tools, change management approaches, return on investment, alignment
with overall IT strategy and many more issues
• Provide a comprehensive discussion of the required integration
of Semantic Web and business strategy. The presented applications,
systems, projects, cases, and implementations help reader to realize the
“Business” perspective of the Semantic Web, ontological engineering,
Semantics exploitation, Semantic Web services, semantic search
engines, semantic interoperability and integration, Enterprise
application integration, enterprise information systems, semantic
portals that are discussed in this edition are challenging reader to realize
that for any successful technology and application within organizations
are required business champions, anchors to business strategy and
justification of return on investment
• Set a context for critical thinking. In the 12 chapters of the book,
reader is challenged to explore his/her knowledge in relevance to
practical issues faced in real world applications. In a way, this edition
goes beyond the academic flavor of most scholar editions. The editing
strategy we followed and the excellent quality of the contributors
delivered an edition in which in every chapter readers build
incrementally a Semantic Web awareness and expertise with great
potential.
6. NEXT MILESTONES
We are very happy, since after many months of preparation this edition is
finally published. We are really looking forward for your comments, ideas
and suggestions for improvement in next versions. In the meanwhile we are
planning a new reference edition for the role of the semantic Web towards
the realization of close-to-market business strategies.
