6. CONCLUSION
After an analysis of the privacy of ZK schemes reveal-
ing several ﬂaws, we introduce several eﬃcient identiﬁcation
schemes that are ZK and public-identity private. To be ef-
ﬁcient, these schemes use short size exponents. Relying on
the SEDDH assumption allows us to avoid full exponentia-
tions. They increase the privacy of the original GPS scheme,
thanks to a small amount of computations. They can be
used in real life applications to preserve owners’ privacy.
The Randomized Hashed GPS scheme seems especially
well suited for identity documents. As a use case, we suggest
to write the cryptographic identity on the document in order
to transmit this public value by an optical covert channel.
The scheme could be used in order to prove the authenticity
of the document. As Randomized Hashed GPS is public-
identity forward private, owner’s identity is not revealed by
the use of contactless devices.

APPENDIX
A. APPLICATION TO THE GQ IDENTIFI-
CATION SCHEME
A.1 RSA moduli
The following protocol is computed over RSA rings. Our
modiﬁcation is based on the diﬃculty of the DDH problem.
It is necessary to describe RSA moduli N such that the
DDH problem is hard on ZN . The integer N should be the
product of two safe primes p and q. If the DDH problem is
hard on the multiplicative group of Z∗
p of order p(cid:48) and on the
multiplicative group of Z∗
and
q(cid:48) = q−1
2 , then DDH is hard over the multiplicative group
of (ZN )∗ of order p(cid:48)q(cid:48).
q of order q(cid:48) where p(cid:48) = p−1
2
It has been proved in [34] that safe RSA rings are pseudo
free groups. As a consequence, the computation of discrete
logarithms is hard on these groups.
A.2 Application of Modiﬁcation 3 to GQ
We brieﬂy describe in Figure 9 how it is possible to mod-
ify the GQ scheme. We need a generator g of the sub-
group of (ZN )∗ of order p(cid:48)q(cid:48) to implement it. The privacy
is improved, from non private (or HI weak private with
the Modiﬁcation 1) to PI forward private. Moreover this
scheme is Identity Based but it is not scalable.
This scheme is designed to ensure mutual authentication
In the following, we focus
between a CLD and a veriﬁer.
on the authentication of the prover. The underlying group
structure is chosen such that the discrete logarithm is a hard
problem. We describe in Figure 10 the protocol where H is
a cryptographic hash function.

identiﬁcation
We assume that the identities are public. In this context,
the public parameters are :
• G and g where g is a generator of the group G of order
q,
• gv the identity of the veriﬁer,
• a list of identities IPi of provers.
Clearly, this scheme is not scalable. One has to search
among the identities to determine the identity of the device.
However, the scheme can be proved narrow-strong and PI
forward private. This is the consequence of the use of the
Diﬃe-Hellman key gvp. In term of computation, the prover
has to compute 3 exponentiations and the veriﬁer has to
make as many computations as the number of identities in
his list.
