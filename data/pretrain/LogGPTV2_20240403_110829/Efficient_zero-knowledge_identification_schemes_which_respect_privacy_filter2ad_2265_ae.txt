## 6. Conclusion

After analyzing the privacy of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) schemes and identifying several flaws, we introduce efficient identification schemes that are both ZK and public-identity private. To achieve efficiency, these schemes use short exponents. By relying on the Short Exponent Decisional Diffie-Hellman (SEDDH) assumption, we avoid full exponentiations, thereby increasing the privacy of the original GPS scheme with minimal computational overhead. These schemes can be applied in real-life applications to preserve owners' privacy. The Randomized Hashed GPS scheme is particularly well-suited for identity documents. As a use case, we suggest writing the cryptographic identity on the document to transmit this public value via an optical covert channel. This scheme can be used to prove the authenticity of the document while ensuring that the owner's identity remains private when using contactless devices.

## Appendix

### A. Application to the GQ Identification Scheme

#### A.1 RSA Moduli
The following protocol is computed over RSA rings. Our modification is based on the difficulty of the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem. It is necessary to describe RSA moduli \(N\) such that the DDH problem is hard on \(\mathbb{Z}_N\). The integer \(N\) should be the product of two safe primes \(p\) and \(q\). If the DDH problem is hard on the multiplicative group of \(\mathbb{Z}_p^*\) of order \(p' = \frac{p-1}{2}\) and on the multiplicative group of \(\mathbb{Z}_q^*\) of order \(q' = \frac{q-1}{2}\), then DDH is hard over the multiplicative group of \((\mathbb{Z}_N)^*\) of order \(p'q'\).

It has been proved in [34] that safe RSA rings are pseudo-free groups. As a consequence, the computation of discrete logarithms is hard on these groups.

#### A.2 Application of Modification 3 to GQ
We briefly describe in Figure 9 how it is possible to modify the GQ scheme. We need a generator \(g\) of the subgroup of \((\mathbb{Z}_N)^*\) of order \(p'q'\) to implement it. The privacy is improved, from non-private (or HI weak private with Modification 1) to PI forward private. Moreover, this scheme is Identity-Based but not scalable.

This scheme is designed to ensure mutual authentication between a Contactless Device (CLD) and a verifier. In the following, we focus on the authentication of the prover. The underlying group structure is chosen such that the discrete logarithm is a hard problem. We describe in Figure 10 the protocol where \(H\) is a cryptographic hash function.

### B. Overview of the Jakobsson and Pointcheval Scheme

The Jakobsson-Pointcheval scheme is designed for mutual authentication in low-power mobile devices. The scheme ensures that both the prover and the verifier can authenticate each other securely. The protocol involves the use of a cryptographic hash function and short exponents to achieve efficiency. The scheme is not scalable, as it requires searching through a list of identities to determine the identity of the device. However, it can be proven to be narrow-strong and PI forward private, thanks to the use of the Diffie-Hellman key \(g^{vp}\). In terms of computation, the prover has to compute three exponentiations, and the verifier has to make as many computations as the number of identities in his list.
