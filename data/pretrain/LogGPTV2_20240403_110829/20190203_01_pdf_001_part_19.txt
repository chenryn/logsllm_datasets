#### Step 4: Create the Subscription
1. Click the **Create** button.
2. If the message "Subscription Created Successfully" appears, click the **OK** button.
3. If an error occurs, investigate and correct the issue, then try again.

**Figure 5-24 - Subscription created successfully**

Upon successful subscription creation, a new **Subscription** node will be added to the replication tree.

**Figure 5-25 - Replication tree after adding a subscription**

The tables and views from the publication will be created in the subscription database, but without any rows. The rows will be populated into the subscription tables during the first snapshot replication.

**Figure 5-26 - Table definitions in the subscription database**

#### 5.3.4 Subscription Metadata Object
After adding a subscription database definition, a single table named `rrep_txset_health` is created as the subscription metadata object.

**For Oracle:**
- The `RREP_TXSET_HEALTH` table is created in the subscription database user’s schema.
- Example:
  ```sql
  SQL> CONNECT subuser/password
  Connected.
  SQL> SET PAGESIZE 9999
  SQL> SELECT table_name FROM user_tables ORDER BY table_name;
  TABLE_NAME
  ------------------------------
  RREP_TXSET_HEALTH
  ```

**For SQL Server:**
- The `rrep_txset_health` table is created in the `_edb_replicator_sub` schema.
- Example:
  ```sql
  1> USE subdb;
  2> GO
  Changed database context to 'subdb'.
  1> SELECT s.name + '.' + o.name "Object Name", o.type_desc "Object Type"
  2> FROM sys.objects o,
  3> sys.schemas s
  4> WHERE s.name <> 'edb'
  5> AND o.type IN ('U','P','FN')
  6> AND o.schema_id = s.schema_id
  7> ORDER BY 2, 1;
  8> GO
  Object Name                 Object Type
  -------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
  _edb_replicator_sub.rrep_txset_health   USER_TABLE
  (1 rows affected)
  ```

**For PostgreSQL:**
- The `rrep_txset_health` table is created in the `_edb_replicator_sub` schema.
- Example:
  ```sql
  subdb=# SET search_path TO _edb_replicator_sub;
  SET
  subdb=# \dt
  List of relations
  Schema | Name | Type | Owner
  ---------------------+-------------------+-------+---------
  _edb_replicator_sub | rrep_txset_health | table | subuser
  (1 row)
  ```

In all subscription database types (Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL), when you remove the subscription database definitions using the xDB Replication Console or xDB Replication Server CLI, the subscription metadata object is deleted from the subscription database.

#### 5.4 On-Demand Replication
After creating a publication and subscription, you have two options for starting the replication process:
- **Immediate Replication:** Take an on-demand snapshot.
- **Scheduled Replication:** Set a schedule for a later date and time.

This section discusses how to initiate on-demand replication. For scheduling, see Section 7.2.

##### 5.4.1 Performing Snapshot Replication
The first replication must be performed using snapshot replication. Subsequent replications can use either the synchronization method (if the publication was not initially defined as a snapshot-only publication) or the snapshot method.

1. Select the **Subscription** node for which you want to perform snapshot replication.
   **Figure 5-27 - Selecting a subscription for an on-demand snapshot**

2. Open the **Snapshot** dialog box in one of the following ways:
   - From the **Subscription** menu, choose **Snapshot**.
   - Right-click the **Subscription** node and choose **Snapshot**.
   - Click the **Snapshot** icon.
   **Figure 5-28 - Opening the Snapshot dialog box**

3. Select the **Verbose Output** check box if you want to display the output from the snapshot in the dialog box. This option should be left unchecked in a network address translation (NAT) environment to avoid delays. Click the **Snapshot** button to start the replication.
   **Figure 5-29 - Snapshot dialog box**

4. If the snapshot is successful, the message "Snapshot Taken Successfully" will appear. Click the **OK** button. If the snapshot fails, review the messages in the **Snapshot** dialog box (if **Verbose Output** was selected) or check the log files.
   **Figure 5-30 - Successful on-demand snapshot**

Status messages for each snapshot are saved in the Migration Toolkit log files (`mtk.log[.n]`) in the following directories:
- **For Linux:**
  ```
  /var/log/xdb-x.x
  ```
- **For Windows:**
  ```
  POSTGRES_HOME\.enterprisedb\xdb\x.x
  ```
  `POSTGRES_HOME` is the home directory of the Windows postgres account (or `enterprisedb` account for Advanced Server installed in Oracle compatible configuration mode). The specific location of `POSTGRES_HOME` depends on your version of Windows. The xDB Replication Server version number is represented by `x.x`.

A record of the snapshot is maintained in the replication history. See Section 7.4 for information on viewing the replication history.

##### 5.4.2 Performing Synchronization Replication
After the first snapshot replication, subsequent replications can be performed using synchronization replication if the publication was not created as a snapshot-only publication.

1. Select the **Subscription** node for which you want to perform synchronization replication.
   - **Trigger-based Method:** Select the **Subscription** node of the subscription.
   - **Log-based Method:** Select the **Subscription** node of any subscription. Synchronization will be performed on all subscriptions regardless of which one is selected.
   **Figure 5-31 - Selecting a subscription for an on-demand synchronization**

2. Open the **Synchronize** dialog box in one of the following ways:
   - From the **Subscription** menu, choose **Synchronize**.
   - Right-click the **Subscription** node and choose **Synchronize**.
   - Click the **Synchronize** icon.
   **Figure 5-32 - Opening the Synchronize dialog box**

3. Click the **Synchronize** button to start the replication.
   **Figure 5-33 - Synchronize dialog box**

4. If the synchronization is successful, the message "Subscription Synchronized Successfully" will appear. Click the **OK** button. If the synchronization fails, review the messages in the **Synchronize** dialog box.
   **Figure 5-34 - Successful on-demand synchronization**

The operations applied to the subscription tables can be seen in the replication history. See Section 7.4 for information on viewing the replication history.

#### 5.5 Managing a Subscription
This section discusses various aspects of managing a subscription in a replication system. For similar information on managing a publication, see Section 7.6.

After creating a subscription, certain attributes of the underlying replication system environment might change, such as the network location of the subscription database server, host running the subscription server, database or operating system user names and passwords, etc.

These changes can result in inaccurate replication system metadata, leading to errors during subsequent replication attempts or system administration. This section describes how to update the metadata stored for the subscription server, the subscription database definition, and subscriptions to keep the information consistent with the actual replication system environment.

##### 5.5.1 Updating a Subscription Server
When you register a subscription server in the xDB Replication Console, you can save the server's network location (IP address and port number), admin user name, and encrypted password in a server login file on the computer running the xDB Replication Console. See Section 4.2 for information on saving the login information.

The following steps show how to update the subscription server’s login information in the server login file.

**Assumptions:**
- The xDB Replication Console is open.
- The subscription server whose login information you wish to alter appears as a **Subscription Server** node in the xDB Replication Console’s replication tree.
  **Figure 5-35 - Subscription Server node**

You can perform the following actions on the server login file:
- Change the subscription server’s login information (host IP address, port number, admin user name, and password).
- Delete the subscription server’s login information.
- Resave the subscription server’s login information.

**Note:**
- These changes only affect the server login file on the current host and do not alter the actual subscription server daemon (on Linux) or service (on Windows).
- The changes affect how the subscription server is viewed through the xDB Replication Console on this host by this user.

**Steps:**
1. Ensure the subscription server is running before making any changes. See Step 1 of Section 5.3.1 for directions on starting the subscription server.
2. Right-click the **Subscription Server** node and choose **Update**. The **Update Subscription Server** dialog box appears.
   **Figure 5-36 - Update Subscription Server dialog box**

3. Complete the fields in the dialog box according to your purpose:
   - **Change the subscription server’s login information:**
     - Enter the correct IP address and port number.
     - Enter the admin user name and password.
     - Check the **Save Login Information** box to save the new login information, or leave it unchecked to require re-registration in subsequent sessions.
   - **Delete previously saved login information:**
     - Ensure the network location is correct.
     - Re-enter the admin user name and password.
     - Leave the **Save Login Information** box unchecked.
   - **Resave the current login information:**
     - Ensure the network location is correct.
     - Re-enter the admin user name and password.
     - Check the **Save Login Information** box.
   **Figure 5-37 - Updated subscription server location**

4. Click the **Update** button. If the dialog box closes, the update was successful. Click the **Refresh** icon in the xDB Replication Console toolbar to show the updated **Subscription Server** node.
   - If an error message appears, the server login file is not modified. Investigate and correct the cause of the error, then repeat steps 1 through 4.

##### 5.5.2 Updating a Subscription Database
When you create a subscription database definition, you save the subscription database server’s network location (IP address and port number), the database identifier, a database login user name, and the user’s password in the control schema accessed by the subscription server. This login information is used whenever a session needs to be established with the subscription database. See Section 5.3.2 for information on creating a subscription database definition.

The following steps show how to update the subscription database login information stored in the control schema if any of these attributes of the actual, physical database change.

**Note:**
- Depending on the database type (Oracle, SQL Server, or PostgreSQL), certain attributes must not be changed if there are existing subscriptions.
- Attributes that must not be changed include:
  - **Oracle:** The login user name, as the subscription tables already reside in this user’s schema.
  - **Database Server Network Location:** If the new location references a database server that does not access the database containing the subscription tables.
  - **Database Identifier:** If the new identifier references a different physical database than where the subscription tables already reside.
- Attributes that may be changed include:
  - The login user name’s password to match a changed database user password.
  - The database server network location if the corresponding location change was made to the database server accessing the subscription database.
  - The database identifier (e.g., Oracle service name, SQL Server database name, or PostgreSQL database name) if the corresponding name change was made on the database server.
  - All attributes may be changed if there are no existing subscriptions.

**Steps:**
1. Ensure the database server that you ultimately wish to save as the subscription database definition is running and accepting client connections.
2. Ensure the subscription server whose node is the parent of the subscription database definition you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.3.1 for directions on starting and registering a subscription server.
3. Select the **Subscription Database** node corresponding to the subscription database definition that you wish to update.
   **Figure 5-38 - Selecting a subscription database definition for update**

4. From the **Subscription** menu, choose **Subscription Database**, and then choose **Update Database**. Alternatively, right-click the **Subscription Database** node and choose **Update Database**. The **Update Database Source** dialog box appears.
5. Enter the desired changes. See Step 3 of Section 5.3.2 for the precise meanings of the fields.
   **Figure 5-39 - Update Database Source dialog box**

6. Click the **Test** button. If "Test Result: Success" appears, click the **OK** button, then click the **Save** button.
   **Figure 5-40 - Successful subscription database test**

- If an error message appears, investigate the cause of the error, correct the problem, and repeat steps 1 through 6.
7. Click the **Refresh** icon in the xDB Replication Console toolbar to show the updated **Subscription Database** node and any of its subscriptions.
   **Figure 5-41 - Updated subscription database**

##### 5.5.3 Updating a Subscription
When a subscription is created, certain attributes of the subscribed publication are stored as part of the metadata for the subscription in the control schema. These include:
- The network IP address of the host running the publication server that is the parent of the subscribed publication.
- The port number of the publication server.

If these attributes of the publication server change in the replication system environment, the corresponding subscription metadata must also be updated so the subscription server can communicate with the correct publication server.

**Steps:**
1. Ensure the subscription server whose node is the parent of the subscription you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console. See Section 5.3.1 for directions on starting and registering a subscription server.
2. Select the **Subscription** node whose attributes you wish to update.
   **Figure 5-42 - Selecting a subscription to update**

3. From the **Subscription** menu, choose **Update Subscription**. Alternatively, right-click the **Subscription** node and choose **Update Subscription**. The **Update Subscription** dialog box appears.
4. Enter the new IP address and port number of the publication server.
5. Click the **Test** button. If "Test Result: Success" appears, click the **OK** button, then click the **Save** button.
6. Click the **Refresh** icon in the xDB Replication Console toolbar to show the updated **Subscription** node.
