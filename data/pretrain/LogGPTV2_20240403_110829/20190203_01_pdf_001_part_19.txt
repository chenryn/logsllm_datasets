In all subscription database types (Oracle, SQL Server, and Postgres) when you remove
the subscription database definitions using the xDB Replication Console or xDB
Replication Server CLI, the subscription metadata object is deleted from the subscription
database.
5.4 On Demand Replication
After a publication and subscription are created, there are a couple of choices for starting
the replication process.
 Replication can be done immediately by taking an on demand snapshot.
 Replication can be scheduled to start at a later date and time by creating a
schedule.
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 203
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
This section discusses the procedure for initiating a replication on demand. Section 7.2
discusses how to create a schedule.
5.4.1 Performing Snapshot Replication
The very first replication must be performed using snapshot replication. After the first
snapshot replication, subsequent replications can be done using either the synchronization
method (if the publication was not initially defined as a snapshot-only publication) or the
snapshot method.
Step 1: Select the Subscription node of the subscription for which you wish to perform
snapshot replication.
Figure 5-27 - Selecting a subscription for an on demand snapshot
Step 2: Open the Snapshot dialog box in any of the following ways:
 From the Subscription menu, choose Snapshot.
 Click the secondary mouse button on the Subscription node and choose Snapshot.
 Click the primary mouse button on the Snapshot icon.

EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
Figure 5-28 - Opening the Snapshot dialog box
Step 3: Select the Verbose Output check box only if you want to display the output from
the snapshot in the dialog box. This option should be left unchecked in a network address
translation (NAT) environment as a large amount of output from the snapshot may delay
the response from the Snapshot dialog box. Click the Snapshot button to start snapshot
replication.

EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
Figure 5-29 - Snapshot dialog box
Step 4: Snapshot Taken Successfully appears if the snapshot was successful. Click the
OK button. If the snapshot was not successful, scroll through the messages in the
Snapshot dialog box window if Verbose Output was selected or check the log files.
The status messages of each snapshot are saved in the Migration Toolkit log files named
mtk.log[.n] (where [.n] is an optional history file count if log file rotation is
enabled) in the following directories:
For Linux:
/var/log/xdb-x.x
For Windows:
POSTGRES_HOME\.enterprisedb\xdb\x.x
POSTGRES_HOME is the home directory of the Windows postgres account
(enterprisedb account for Advanced Server installed in Oracle compatible
configuration mode). The specific location of POSTGRES_HOME is dependent upon your
version of Windows. The xDB Replication Server version number is represented by x.x.

Figure 5-30 - Successful on demand snapshot
The publication has now been replicated to the subscription database. A record of the
snapshot is maintained in the replication history. See Section 7.4 for information on how
to view replication history.
5.4.2 Performing Synchronization Replication
After the first snapshot replication, subsequent replications can be performed using
synchronization replication if the publication was not created as a snapshot-only
publication.
Step 1: When the trigger-based method of synchronization replication is in use, select the
Subscription node of the subscription for which you wish to perform synchronization
replication.
When the log-based method of synchronization replication is in use, select the
Subscription node of any subscription. For the log-based method, the synchronization
replication will be performed on all subscriptions regardless of which one is selected.

The operations that were applied to the subscription tables can be seen in the replication
history. See Section 7.4 for information on how to view replication history.
5.5 Managing a Subscription
Note: This section discusses various aspects of managing a subscription of a replication
system. For a similar discussion on managing a publication of a replication system, see
Section 7.6.
After a subscription has been created, certain aspects of the underlying replication system
environment might be subsequently altered for any number of reasons. Attributes that
might change include the network location of the subscription database server, the
network location of the host running the subscription server, database or operating system
user names and passwords, and so forth.
The aforementioned information is saved in the replication system metadata when a
subscription is created. Changes to these attributes result in inaccurate replication system
metadata, which in turn may result in errors during subsequent replication attempts or
replication system administration.
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 210
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
This section describes how to update the metadata stored for the subscription server, the
subscription database definition, and subscriptions in order to keep the information
consistent with the actual replication system environment.
5.5.1 Updating a Subscription Server
When you register a subscription server in the xDB Replication Console, you may choose
to save the subscription server’s network location (IP address and port number), admin
user name, and encrypted password in a server login file on the computer on which you
are running the xDB Replication Console. See Section 4.2 for information on saving the
login information.
The steps described in this section show you how to update the subscription server’s
login information in the server login file.
It is assumed that the xDB Replication Console is open on your computer and the
subscription server whose login information you wish to alter in the server login file,
appears as a Subscription Server node in the xDB Replication Console’s replication tree.
Figure 5-35 - Subscription Server node
You can perform the following actions on the server login file:
 Change the subscription server’s login information (host IP address, port number,
admin user name, and password) that you last saved in the server login file.
 Delete the subscription server’s login information that is currently saved in the
server login file. This is the default action, which will require you to register the
subscription server again the next time you open the xDB Replication Console.
 Resave the subscription server’s login information in the server login file. Each
time you open the Update Subscription Server dialog box, you must choose to
save the login information if you want it recorded in the server login file.
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 211
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
The following steps change only the content of the server login file residing on the host
under the current xDB Replication Console user’s home directory. These changes do not
alter any characteristic of the actual subscription server daemon (on Linux) or service (on
Windows). These changes affect only how a subscription server is viewed through the
xDB Replication Console on this host by this user.
Step 1: The subscription server whose login information you want to save, change, or
delete in the server login file must be running before you can make any changes to the
file. See Step 1 of Section 5.3.1 for directions on starting the subscription server.
Step 2: Click the secondary mouse button on the Subscription Server node and choose
Update. The Update Subscription Server dialog box appears.
Figure 5-36 - Update Subscription Server dialog box
Step 3: Complete the fields in the dialog box according to your purpose for updating the
server login file:
 If the subscription server now runs on a host with a different IP address or port
number than what is shown in the dialog box, enter the correct information. You
must also enter the admin user name and password saved in the xDB Replication
Configuration file that resides on the host identified by the IP address you entered
in the Host field. Check the Save Login Information box if you want the new
login information saved in the server login file, otherwise leave the box
unchecked in which case, access to the subscription server is available for the
current session, but subsequent sessions will require you to register the
subscription server again.
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 212
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
 If you want to delete previously saved login information, make sure the network
location shown in the dialog box is still correct. Re-enter the admin user name and
password saved in the xDB Replication Configuration file that resides on the host
identified by the IP address in the Host field. Leave the Save Login Information
box unchecked. Access to the subscription server is available for this session, but
subsequent sessions will require you to register the subscription server again.
 If you want to save the current login information shown in the dialog box, make
sure the network location shown in the dialog box is correct. Re-enter the admin
user name and password saved in the xDB Replication Configuration file that
resides on the host identified by the IP address in the Host field. Check the Save
Login Information box.
Figure 5-37 - Updated subscription server location
Step 4: Click the Update button. If the dialog box closes, then the update to the server
login file was successful. Click the Refresh icon in the xDB Replication Console tool bar
to show the updated Subscription Server node.
If an error message appears after clicking the Update button, the server login file is not
modified. Investigate and correct the cause of the error. Repeat steps 1 through 4.
5.5.2 Updating a Subscription Database
When you create a subscription database definition, you save the subscription database
server’s network location (IP address and port number), the database identifier, a
database login user name, and the user’s password in the control schema accessed by the
subscription server. This login information is used whenever a session needs to be
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 213
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
established with the subscription database. See Section 5.3.2 for information on creating
a subscription database definition.
The steps described in this section show you how to update the subscription database
login information stored in the control schema should any of these attributes of the actual,
physical database change.
Note: Depending upon the database type (Oracle, SQL Server, or Postgres), certain
attributes must not be changed. If you have already added subscriptions, you must not
change any attribute that alters access to the schema where the subscription tables were
created.
Attributes you must not change if there are existing subscriptions include the following:
 The Oracle login user name as the subscription tables already reside in this Oracle
user’s schema
 The database server network location if the new network location references a
database server that does not access the database that already contains the
subscription tables
 The database identifier if the new database identifier references a different
physical database than where the subscription tables already reside
Attributes you may change include the following:
 The login user name’s password to match a changed database user password
 The database server network location if the corresponding location change was
made to the database server that accesses the subscription database
 The database identifier such as the Oracle service name, SQL Server database
name, or Postgres database name if the corresponding name change was made on
the database server
 All attributes may be changed if there are no existing subscriptions
Step 1: Make sure the database server that you ultimately wish to save as the subscription
database definition is running and accepting client connections.
Step 2: Make sure the subscription server whose node is the parent of the subscription
database definition you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB
Replication Console you are using. See Section 5.3.1 for directions on starting and
registering a subscription server.
Step 3: Select the Subscription Database node corresponding to the subscription database
definition that you wish to update.

Figure 5-38 - Selecting a subscription database definition for update
Step 4: From the Subscription menu, choose Subscription Database, and then choose
Update Database. Alternatively, click the secondary mouse button on the Subscription
Database node and choose Update Database. The Update Database Source dialog box
appears.
Step 5: Enter the desired changes. See Step 3 of Section 5.3.2 for the precise meanings of
the fields.

5.5.3 Updating a Subscription
When a subscription is created, certain attributes of the subscribed publication are stored
as part of the metadata for the subscription in the control schema. These include the
following:
 The network IP address of the host running the publication server that is the
parent of the subscribed publication
 The port number of the publication server
If the preceding attributes of the publication server change in the replication system
environment, then the corresponding subscription metadata must also be changed so the
subscription server can communicate with the correct publication server.
The following directions show how to update the publication server network IP address
and port number within the subscription server’s metadata.
Step 1: Make sure the subscription server whose node is the parent of the subscription
you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console
you are using. See Section 5.3.1 for directions on starting and registering a subscription
server.
Step 2: Select the Subscription node whose attributes you wish to update.
