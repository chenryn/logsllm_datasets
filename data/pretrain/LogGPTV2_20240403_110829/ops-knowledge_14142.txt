User: I'm reading from a "bookazine" which I purchased from WHSmiths today and its said
during the setup I need to type in these commands into the terminal (or the Command Prompt in my case) in order to make a script without needing to do it manually. One of these commands is chmod +x (file name) but because this is based of Linux or Mac and I am on Windows I am not sure how to make my script executable, how do I?
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: You don't have shell scripts on Windows, you have batch or powershell. 
If your reading is teaching Unix things, get a virtual machine running (insert popular Linux distribution here). 
Regarding python, you just execute python script.py
