We perform this analysis to gain a general understanding of
voice and voicemail spam, and we emphasize that, due to
the biased method of data collection, these results do not
constitute measurements that reﬂect trends on the whole of
voice and voicemail spam. However, these results provide
needed background and insight into the actual voice and
voicemail spam. We will describe the following prevalent
types of spam: credit card veriﬁcation scam, fake tax agent
scam, and political robocalls.
In the credit card veriﬁcation scam samples, the called
recipients are informed that their credit card account was
deactivated, and they are asked to enter their credit card and
social security number over the phone to verify their identity
and get the account reactivated. While we only were able
to listen to the audio of the call, based on comments from
some of the uploaders, the scammers would spoof the caller
ID to make it look as if the call originated from the credit
card issuer. All of these scam calls used an Interactive Voice
Response system to interact with the recipients and collect
their credit card information. We found that the audio from
the scammer’s IVR system came from either a synthesized
voice or audio duplicated from the IVR system of the real
credit card issuer. From what we observed, the use of caller
ID spooﬁng and sound duplicated from the real credit card
issuer’s IVR system made it almost indistinguishable from
a real credit card veriﬁcation call.
In the fake tax agent scam samples, the recipient receives
a call from the scammer identifying himself as a tax agent
of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and provides a fake
badge number. The scammer proceeds to tell the recipient
that he or she owes a speciﬁc amount of money to the

IRS. Often, the scammers demand immediate payment and
threaten jail, deportation, or loss of driver’s license if the
victim does not pay. Based on the comments from the
uploaders, the scammers would spoof their caller ID to make
it look as if the call originated from a government agency
by showing an area code from 202 (Washington, DC). These
scammers seem to target immigrants [11]. We found that the
majority used a live person to interact with the victim, and
the rest used a prerecorded synthesized voice without an IVR
system. One thing we noted was that all of the live person
scammers had a South Asian accent, and in our opinion, the
accent had made the call sound highly suspicious and easy
to recognize as a scam (which might explain why it was
posted online as a scam).
In the political robocall samples, the typical content is a
prerecorded message making a political advertisement, or a
poll asking the recipient about their political opinion. In the
United States, political robocalls are exempt from regulation
by the national Do-Not-Call Registry and the Telephone
Consumer Protection Act of 1991. Before a national or state
level election, they are distributed in high frequency using
voice and voicemail broadcasting autodialers. All of the
audio samples contained a prerecorded message, and most
polls used an IVR system to interact with the recipient.
3) Mass Distribution: Mass distribution is the next crit-
ical step to a successful spam operation. The goal is to
massively and cost-effectively deliver the spam content to
a list of telephone numbers.
Using VoIP service to distribute calls to PSTN numbers,
the content can be disseminated at a much higher volume,
and at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional tele-
phony. To understand the distribution cost of spamming, we
researched the prices and found hundreds of VoIP service
providers offering pay-by-the-minute calling service to US
telephone numbers priced around $0.01 per minute. We also
found some ﬁxed monthly-fee pricing model with unlimited
calling for about $150, however, these service providers tend
to target small businesses, and these plans usually come with
throttling, so high volume calling services are almost always
offered with a pay-by-the-minute model.
Some VoIP service providers (such as CallFire1 and Call-
Em-All2) even cater speciﬁcally to telemarketers, providing
features such as integrated autodialer and customizable caller
ID in their service.
4) Circumvention: Spamming is an adversarial game, as
spam defenses are widely introduced, the spammer has an
incentive to defeat them. According to a poll conducted by
Harris Poll on behalf of WhitePages in 2013, 22% of US
smartphone users used a call-blocking app or a feature to
block calls on their device [12]. Most mobile phones today
1https://www.callﬁre.com/
2https://www.call-em-all.com/
contain basic capability to automatically block calls from a
list of unwanted callers.
For the spammers today, two common ways to defeat them
is to use voicemail injection and caller ID spooﬁng.
is unanswered or declined,
Voicemail injection is a recent extension of the autodialer
which delivers prerecorded voice messages into the recipi-
ents’ voice mailbox (voicemail). Typically, when a phone
call
it gets forwarded to an
answering machine that lets the caller leave a voice mes-
sage. A voicemail broadcasting autodialer uses Answering
Machine Detection (AMD) [13] technology to automati-
cally complete the process of inserting a prerecorded voice
message into the recipient’s voicemail. A more recent type
of voicemail broadcaster can even deliberately trigger the
recipient’s voicemail, a technique known as Forced Busy
Channel [14], to directly inject a voice message into the
recipient’s voicemail without waiting for the call
to be
unanswered or declined.
Caller ID spooﬁng is the practice of deliberately falsifying
the caller ID information sent to the recipient that identiﬁes
the caller of a phone call. It is particularly effective for
defeating the call blockers and helps to further a variety of
scams. The caller ID service provides the caller’s telephone
number (and in some cases the caller’s name) to the recipient
before or during the ring of an incoming call. It allows the
recipient to decide whether to answer a call based on the
caller ID information, or to call back if the call could not be
answered. The caller ID number is also widely used in other
non-voice communication services, such as SMS, MMS, and
many smartphone apps. The caller ID number is typically
provided by the caller’s switch, which can control what
caller ID number is sent on a call-by-call basis. For general
consumers, a legally mandated privacy feature allows them
to hide the calling number [15]. However, malicious callers
can also take advantage of the declarative nature of the
caller ID mechanism to spoof or block the caller ID number,
in order to defeat spam ﬁlters and further a variety of
scams. The caller ID number can be easily spoofed because
there is no built-in authentication mechanism, and it is not
immediately veriﬁable by the recipient. The caller’s service
provider does not have any legal obligation to ensure that
the caller ID number in the call request header is indeed
owned by the caller before it is transmitted. In fact, some
ITSPs today advertise customizable caller ID as a service
feature.
III. KEY CHALLENGES
We identify several challenges in combating telephone
spam—that are signiﬁcantly different from email spam—
some of which are technical and some of which are regula-
tory.

A. Immediacy Constraint
Unlike email, which can be queued for later analysis, a
voice call has an immediacy constraint. A telephone call
request is immediate and therefore must be analyzed as
soon as it appears, and the telephone anti-spam system must
complete analysis and take action within a short window of
time to reduce the delay. If a solution adds too much delay
to a call request, the legitimate caller may assume that the
recipient could not answer the phone and hang up.
B. Difﬁculty of Working with Audio Streams
The content of a voice call is difﬁcult to parse and analyze:
the content is an audio stream as opposed to the text of an
email. To make matters worse, the content of a voice call is
only revealed when the call is answered, and both the caller
and the recipient will be affected if an anti-spam system
answers the call. Whereas an email anti-spam system can
easily analyze the content of an email, and neither the sender
nor the receiver is affected.
C. Lack of Useful Header Data
Voice calls lack the rich header data of email. When a
call arrives at the recipient, it contains little useful header
information. An example of a call header used in traditional
phone terminals is shown in Table III in the Appendix. An
email header, however, has well-deﬁned and information-
rich SMTP headers—before the content of the email. It is
also difﬁcult to omit the sender’s IP address and domain
name of the email. This is in stark contrast to a call request
header, where the header data is easily omittable by a
spammer.
D. Hard to Gain User Acceptance
The bar for user acceptance of a telephone anti-spam
system is much higher compared to email. Consumers,
rightly, have a very low tolerance for false positives of
blocked calls. Phone calls tends to be more urgent and
important compared the email, and once a phone call is
wrongfully blocked it could have severe consequences.
With the rise of VoIP services that provide features such
as caller ID customization over the Internet, it is trivial for
any caller to cheaply and effectively spoof the caller ID.
Thus, any telephone spam defense technique that relies on
the caller ID is now vulnerable to caller ID spooﬁng.
F. Difﬁculty of Tracing Spam Calls
One way to combat spam is to make it illegal and enforce
those laws. In the history of email spam, a small number of
players were responsible for the majority of the spam, hence
taking action against these big targets resulted in signiﬁcant
drops of spam volume. For instance, shutting down the Rus-
tock botnet reduced global spam levels by around 40% [17].
It is reasonable to assume a similar distribution of telephone
spammers. Unfortunately, identifying the actual distribution
of telephone spammers is difﬁcult due to the technical and
regulatory challenges of monitoring PSTN trafﬁc and the
prevalence of caller ID spooﬁng.
It is difﬁcult to locate the true origin of a call after it
has been initiated. PSTN calls are designed to work on
the principle of forwarding tables and circuit switching.
Each time a call is placed, only the destination number is
used for routing. It works by establishing individual circuits
down a sequence of neighboring switches until it ends up
at the recipient’s terminal. The outbound switch(es) do not
necessarily need to know whether the optional caller ID
number in the call request header would route back to
the caller’s terminal. If the outbound switch also serves as
the caller’s inbound switch, then the TSP could perhaps
verify the true owner of the caller ID number from its own
records. However, the TSPs do not have a legal obligation to
perform any veriﬁcation, or to share that information with
the recipient, thus, without the cooperation of the caller’s
TSP, tracing a spam call is almost impossible.
To make matters worse, as spam calls can now be initiated
over the Internet, a spammer can further hide behind proxies,
VPNs, or Tor networks, or even distribute outbound calls
using a botnet, adding even more difﬁculty in tracing the
exact whereabouts of a spammer.
E. Caller ID Spooﬁng
G. Entrenched Legacy Systems
The Caller ID service is an information service that
provides the recipient with information of the caller before
answering the phone, which could be useful for blocking
spam calls. However, caller ID fundamentally has no authen-
tication mechanism and is easily spoofed. The only security
mechanism comes from having the TSP send the caller ID
on behalf of the caller. This security mechanism is eroded
when the spammer subscribes to a TSP service that allows
customization of caller IDs. It used to be prohibitively ex-
pensive for individuals and small businesses to purchase the
equipment necessary to enable the customization of caller
IDs (an ISDN-PRI trunk line costs $500 to more than $1,000
per month and a PBX system that costs thousands [16]).
The PSTN ecosystem has been around for several decades,
allowing any phone to reach any other phone through a
vast interconnection of switching centers. While the core
networks have evolved to be almost entirely carried by
an IP-based infrastructure, the signaling protocols have not
changed (to ensure legacy compatibility). Even though VoIP
is touted as a major revolution of voice communication,
the legacy of PSTN protocols will remain for many years
to come. Change is difﬁcult when the entire ecosystem
must ensure that the majority of legacy systems will work,
and therefore wholesale replacement of the core telephony
system is a nonstarter. As a result, telephone spammers can
exploit the weaknesses in the legacy technology (such as the

lack of caller ID veriﬁcation) to run a successful spamming
operation.
H. Lack of Effective Regulations
Unfortunately, there is also a lack of incentive for the
industry to participate in the anti-spam effort. Unlike email
and Internet trafﬁc where the peering model [9] incentivizes
the Internet service providers to reduce the load of spam
trafﬁc on their systems, telephony service providers proﬁt
from the spam-generated trafﬁc and intercarrier compen-
sation fees. Most players (phone number collectors, lead
sellers, telephony service providers, and backbone carriers)
in the PSTN ecosystem proﬁt from telephone spam, except
the consumer. Although TSPs may beneﬁt in other ways
by reducing telephone spam (for instance, in better public
relations or charging spam-ﬁltering service as a fee), there
exists, at least, a minor monetary disincentive.
Further complicating matters, the current United States
law ensure that TSPs are immune from liability for servicing
spam calls [18] under the Telephone Consumer Protection
Act of 1991, which means that they cannot be held liable
for servicing spam calls. Classiﬁed as common carriers,
TSPs have an obligation to move all phone trafﬁc with no
exceptions [19]. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to implement anti-
spam solutions at the most natural place: the TSP who has
a direct view of the telephony network.
I. Lack of Globalized Enforcement
In the United States, a number of laws and regulation
exist at both the federal and state levels, such as making
robocalling illegal (with some exemptions) [20], making
caller ID spooﬁng illegal (with some exemptions) [21], and
the establishment of a national Do-Not-Call Registry [22].
The FTC is also interested in stopping telephone spam, and
they have held numerous competitions to combat robocall-
ing [23]. Despite resolute efforts by the US government,
robocalling and caller ID spooﬁng is still an unsolved
problem. Technology and globalization have resulted in
telephony networks shifting from a national ecosystem to a
global ecosystem. With the use of VoIP service, a telephone
spammer can cheaply distribute outbound calls from an
overseas location. Because the spammers lie beyond the
jurisdiction of US law enforcement authorities, it is hard for
law enforcement to prosecute those spammers for breaking
the law. Effective control of telephone spam would therefore
require cross-border enforcement. However, cross-border
jurisdiction of telephone spam has yet to catch up with
the present technology, and many countries would have no
incentive to cooperate with US regulatory and enforcement
agencies.
IV. BASIC TECHNIQUES
To identify the state-of-the-art in preventing voice and
voicemail spam, we gathered existing techniques from aca-
demic, industry, SPam over Internet Telephony (SPIT), and
Internet domain, and systematically categorize them into the
following classes: (1) Call Request Header Analysis, (2)
Voice Interactive Screening, and (3) Caller Compliance.
A. Call Request Header Analysis
Call Request Header Analysis is a category of techniques
that ﬁlters calls based on the header information associated
with the call request. For instance, the caller ID is a popular
type of request header information that can be used to
analyze a call. The effectiveness of Call Request Header
Analysis depends on the accuracy of
the information
collected, which could be severely impacted when spooﬁng
or omission is possible.
Caller ID Blacklisting rejects a call if the caller’s phone
number (captured from caller ID or Automatic Number
Identiﬁcation service) appears on a blacklist, otherwise,
calls from all other phone numbers are accepted. This
can be used to block spam calls by blacklisting phone
numbers that are known to be spamming, and the recipient’s
terminal would silently block all phone calls from those
phone numbers without disturbing the recipient. Caller ID
Blacklisting only blocks phone numbers that are explicitly
added to a blacklist, hence it tends to be permissive to all
other callers. As caller ID service has become ubiquitous
in all telephone services, Caller ID Blacklisting does not
face compatibility issues. Caller ID Blacklisting is easy to
implement and requires very little computational resources,
and it is a common feature in modern smartphones [24],
[25]. However, a blacklist must be well populated to be
effective against spam, therefore compiling a comprehensive
list would not be scalable for the recipient. A spammer
could defeat Caller ID Blacklisting by spooﬁng any number
not known to be blacklisted, hence it is not effective against
most forms of call request header manipulation.
Caller ID Whitelisting only accepts calls from phone
numbers that appear on a whitelist, otherwise, calls from
all other phone numbers are rejected. This can be used to
block spam calls by whitelisting phone numbers that are
known to be trusted, and the recipient’s terminal would
silently block phone calls from all other phone numbers
without disturbing the recipient. Caller ID Whitelisting is
easy to implement and requires very little resources, and
it is easy to ﬁnd implementations on modern smartphones
[26], [27]. Caller ID Whitelisting blocks all calls that are
not added to a whitelist, and does not need to be well
populated to be effective against spam, hence it is quite
scalable for the recipient when defending against spam. It
is usually quite easy to populate a whitelist, as the numbers
could be derived from the recipient’s contacts list. However,
unknown legitimate callers would always get blocked in
Caller ID Whitelisting. A spammer could defeat Caller ID
Whitelisting by spooﬁng the caller ID of a number known

to be trusted by the recipient, however this is more difﬁcult
without prior knowledge about the recipient’s whitelist.
[29],
reputation or
[28]–[31], caller behavior
Caller Reputation System uses
trust
associated with a caller’s phone number to determine if the
caller is a spammer. A Caller Reputation System maintains
and publishes reputation scores associated with individual
callers, in which the reputation scores are computed based
on various caller-related information such as recipient
black/white-lists
[32],
[33], recipient behavior [28], [34], [35], caller’s domain
reputation [30], [36], social connections [34], [37]–[40], and
recipient feedbacks [28], [29], [31], [36], [41], [42]. There
are also many opportunities to improve a Caller Reputation
System by developing better scoring algorithms. The Caller
Reputation System can be used to ﬁlter spam calls by
conﬁguring the recipient’s terminal
to block calls from
callers associated with poor reputation. A Caller Reputation
System generally requires a large amount of data, which are
usually crowdsourced from many recipients, and the data
would need to be curated by an administrative third party. It
would also require frequent maintenance to ensure quality
and freshness of data in order to be effective. However,
large scale collection of personal information could be at
risk of violating privacy. Caller Reputation System could be
vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where a malicious caller obtains
multiple identities to gain a large inﬂuence over its own (or
other caller’s) reputation. Because the reputation of a caller
is associated with the caller’s phone number, a spammer
could defeat the Caller Reputation System by spooﬁng the
caller ID to a number with a good reputation. A malicious
caller could also sabotage someone by deliberately making
junk calls while spooﬁng the caller ID number, such that
the victim gets a poor reputation.
