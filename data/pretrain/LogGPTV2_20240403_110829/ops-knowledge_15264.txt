User: How to use Git to manage the code version control of a team project?
Assistant: 1. Create a Git repository: Use the Git command in a local folder or use the Git website to create a repository. 2. Teamwork: share the warehouse with the team members through Git's remote warehouse sharing function, and let them modify and submit the code. 3. Processing submission: After the team members submit the code, they can review and audit the code to ensure the quality. 4. Version control: Using Git's version control function, you can easily track problems when code problems occur. You can use Git's branching feature to create a new branch to handle bugs, and after checking out all changes, merge them into the main branch. 5. Conflict resolution: Since multiple people modify the same code at the same time, code conflicts may occur. In this case, team members need to coordinate to resolve conflicts and ensure that the modified code works correctly. 6. Monitor changes: By using Git's monitoring function, you can track code changes and discover inappropriate modifications in time. 7. Backup and restore: Regularly use Git's backup function to back up the code to prevent data loss, and use Git's restore function to easily restore data so that you can start working again.
