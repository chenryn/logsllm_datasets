User: I would like to install openpyxl-1.8.4 on Python 2.7 that comes with Mac Lion. My Python compiler is under system/library/Frameworks/Python.frameworks/Versions/2.7/bin.
I tried 

python2.7 setup.py install

and also

sudo python2.7 setup.py install

and seems to me none of them works. Am I missing something? I really appreciate your help.
Thanks
Assistant: Install openpyxl using pip: sudo pip install openpyxl
