I am trying to install `openpyxl-1.8.4` on Python 2.7, which is included with Mac OS X Lion. My Python executable is located at `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin`.

I attempted the following commands:

```sh
python2.7 setup.py install
```

and

```sh
sudo python2.7 setup.py install
```

However, neither of these methods seems to work. Am I missing something? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

**Assistant:**

To install `openpyxl`, it is recommended to use `pip`. You can do this by running the following command:

```sh
sudo pip install openpyxl
```

If `pip` is not installed, you can first install it using the following command:

```sh
sudo easy_install pip
```

After installing `pip`, you can proceed with the `openpyxl` installation as suggested above.
