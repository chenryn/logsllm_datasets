I have a monorepo, containing a `create-react-app` application, a `next.js`
application and a separate library. This library is linked (with `yarn link`)
to the two applications and has `styled-components` as a peer dependency,
which is installed in both the applications.
The linking works fine in the `create-react-app` application but in `next.js`
it breaks resulting in the following error:
    Error in @scrnhq/eurovision-elements
    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'styled-components' in '/Users/robert/sites/eurovision/elements/dist'
    ModuleNotFoundError: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'styled-components' in '/Users/robert/sites/eurovision/elements/dist'

Installing `styled-components` inside this library is not possible as it has
to be a peer dependency, see: https://www.styled-
components.com/docs/faqs#i-am-a-library-author-should-i-bundle-
styledcomponents-with-my-library
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
`next.js` should resolve peer dependencies of linked modules in the correct
way, meaning from the project's `node_modules` folder.
## Current Behavior
It looks like peer dependencies currently are not resolved from the correct
place, as it looks like it's only looking at the folder (and parents) of the
linked module itself.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
As this is a closed source project I can't share the source code or set up,
but if necessary I can add a similar reproducible example later.
