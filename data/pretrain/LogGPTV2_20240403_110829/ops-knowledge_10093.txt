Question: "Considering the operational technology (OT) vulnerabilities discovered in the OT:ICEFALL study, what could be the potential consequences of using hard-coded cryptographic keys in OT products? Select all applicable answers."
 "A": "Hard-coded cryptographic keys may allow adversaries to decrypt sensitive data, leading to a breach of confidentiality."
 "B": "Using hard-coded cryptographic keys could result in a more secure system as the key is never transmitted over the network."
 "C": "Adversaries could exploit hard-coded keys to alter the behavior of OT products, potentially causing physical harm."
 "D": "Hard-coded cryptographic keys can streamline system maintenance by reducing the complexity of key management."
Answer: AC
