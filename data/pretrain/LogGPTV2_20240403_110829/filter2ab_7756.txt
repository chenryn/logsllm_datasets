### Title: Botconf 2013 - APT1: Technical Backstage

In early 2013, Mandiant released a comprehensive report on a hacking group known as APT1. Paul Rascagneres' presentation delves into an in-depth analysis of this group, leveraging the data provided by Mandiant. His research uncovered numerous Command and Control (C&C) servers located in China, all running the same software highlighted in the Mandiant report. By exploiting vulnerabilities in these C&C servers, Paul was able to penetrate the infrastructure, providing a unique and detailed insight into the activities and methodologies employed by the attackers.

This presentation will explore the infrastructure, tools, and malware used by APT1 to conduct unauthorized backups of company data and intellectual property. It offers a rare, behind-the-scenes look at the technical aspects of their operations.
