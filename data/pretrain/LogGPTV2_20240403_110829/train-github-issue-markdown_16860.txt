The following code should be disallowed in strict mode and ES5:

```javascript
"\5";
"\05";
"\55";
"\055";
```

These are disallowed according to Annex B.1.2 of the ECMAScript 5 specification.

### Explanation:
- **Strict Mode**: In strict mode, certain syntax that is considered potentially problematic or ambiguous is prohibited to enforce better coding practices.
- **ES5 Specification (Annex B.1.2)**: This annex outlines specific incompatibilities and restrictions for environments that support legacy web content. The mentioned octal escape sequences are among the constructs that are disallowed to prevent potential issues with older JavaScript engines.

By adhering to these rules, developers can ensure their code is more robust and less prone to errors.
