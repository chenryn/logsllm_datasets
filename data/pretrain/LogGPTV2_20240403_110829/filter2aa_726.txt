 "When democracy relies on entertainment to provide 
knowledge of its secret affairs, the contradictions of  
empire are "normalized to invisibility" thru a blurring 
of fictional and real operations."  
- Timothy Melley, The Covert Sphere
Project Blue Book 
The USAF creates Project Blue Book in 1952. Dr. J. Allen 
Hynek, Northwestern University astronomer, is retained as 
a resource scientist. 
The CIA gets involved and concludes a study: 
- Flying saucers are not a threat to national security but 
reports of flying saucers are. 
- Military personnel should be trained in proper observation 
of flying saucers. 
- Programs should be created to debunk flying saucers to the 
citizenry.
Fast forward to Hynek when he created CUFOS in 1973 
(The Center for UFO Studies) as an independent 
organization because he became disillusioned with the 
USAF: 
"The public was, in fact, placed in the role of 'the 
enemy,' against whom 'counterespionage' tactics must 
be employed. From my personal experience, I 
frequently felt that those in charge did consider people 
who reported UFOs or who took a serious interest in 
them and wanted information about them, as 
enemies." (UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry, 
p. 243)
