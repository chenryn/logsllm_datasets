We will prove the security of our scheme from Assump-
tions 1, 2, 3 and 4 using a hybrid argument over a sequence
of games. The ﬁrst game, Gamereal is the real security game
(the ciphertext and all the keys are normal).
In the next
game, Game0, all of the keys will be normal, but the chal-
lenge ciphertext will be semi-functional. We let q denote the
number of key queries made by the attacker. For k from 1
to q, we deﬁne
Gamek,1 In this game, the challenge ciphertext is semi- func-
tional, the ﬁrst k − 1 keys are semi-functional of type
3, the kth key is semi-functional of type 1, and the
remaining keys are normal.
Gamek,2 In this game, the challenge ciphertext is semi- func-
tional, the ﬁrst k − 1 keys are semi-functional of type
3, the kth key is semi-functional of type 2, and the
remaining keys are normal.
Gamek,3 In this game, the challenge ciphertext is semi- func-
tional, the ﬁrst k keys are semi-functional of type 3,
and the remaining keys are normal.
For notational purposes, we think of Game0,3 as another
way of denoting Game0. We note that in Gameq,3, all of
the keys are semi-functional of type 3. In the penultimate
game, GameFinal0 , all the keys are semi-functional, and the
ciphertext is a semi-functional encryption of a random mes-
sage, independent of the messages M0 and M1 provided by
the adversary. The ﬁnal game, GameFinal1 , is the same as
GameFinal0 , except that in the challenge ciphertext, C1,x and
× Gp4 at random (thus the
C2,x are chosen from Gp1
ciphertext is independent from T0 and T1 provided by the
adversary). It is clear that in the ﬁnal game, no adversary
can have advantage greater than 0.
× Gp2
We prove that these games are indistinguishable in six
lemmas, whose formal descriptions and proofs are given in
the Appendix. Therefore, we conclude that the advantage
of the adversary in Gamereal (i.e., the real security game) is
negligible. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented an eﬃcient CP-ABE scheme
with partially hidden access structures. Our scheme can
handle any access structure that can be expressed as an
LSSS. Previous CP-ABE schemes with partially hidden ac-
cess structures [22, 19, 13] only support restricted access
structures, which can be expressed as AND gates on multi-
valued attributes with wildcards; thus our scheme is more
ﬂexible and expressive.
By applying the dual system encryption methodology [29],
we proved that our scheme is fully secure in the standard
model. The security of our scheme relies on some non-
standard complexity assumptions. A further direction is to
ﬁnd expressive CP-ABE constructions with partially hidden
access structures from simple assumptions.

APPENDIX
A. SECURITY PROOFS
Lemma 1. Suppose that G satisﬁes Assumption 1. Then
Gamereal and Game0 are computationally indistinguishable.
Proof. Suppose there exists an algorithm A that distin-
guishes Gamereal and Game0. Then we can build an algo-
rithm B with non-negligible advantage in breaking Assump-
tion 1. B is given g, X3, X4, T and will simulate Gamereal
or Game0 with A. B chooses α, a, a0, a1, . . . , an ∈ ZN and
Z ∈ Gp4 uniformly at random. It then sets h = ga0 , u1 =
ga1 , . . . , un = gan , and sends A the public parameters:
PK = (N, g, ga, e(g, g)α, u1, . . . , un, H = h · Z, X4).
It can generate normal keys in response to A’s key requests
by using the key generation algorithm, since it knows the
MSK = (h, X3, α).
At some point, A sends B two (equal length) messages
M0, M1 and two access structures (A, ρ,T0), (A, ρ,T1). B
chooses β ∈ {0, 1} randomly and does the following.
