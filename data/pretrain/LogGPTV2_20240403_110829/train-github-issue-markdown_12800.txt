        if not len(values) and 'dtype' not in kwargs:
    TypeError: object of type 'numpy.int64' has no len()
A 0-d array passes this check cause it is an Iterable. But later, when
**len()** is called on, TypeError is raised.  
It would be nice to implement PEP 357 to prevent this error.  
The matter has been raised at PyTorch project. #9237
