Testing #2218
The duplicate here is not a problem because the code is not in strict mode
(also tried running it and node runs it just fine):
    // "use strict";
    var o = { p: 1, p: 2};
    console.log(o);

## But in ES6 this is not an error anymore?
I have also found the following interesting note at
