In the `sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_curve` documentation,
> thresholds : array, shape = [n_thresholds := len(np.unique(probas_pred))]
But as the example below shows,
    >>> y_scores = np.array([0.1, 0.4, 0.35, 0.8])
    ...
    >>> thresholds
    array([ 0.35,  0.4 ,  0.8 ])
the shape of threshold is not `len(np.unique(probas_pred))`.
