### Social Network Analysis
- **Target Rich Environment:**
  - **Data Volume:** Approximately 21 exabytes per month
  - **Facebook Users:** Around 500 million
  - **Privacy Paradox:**
    - "I take privacy seriously"
    - 89% use real names
    - 61% use identifiable pictures
  - **Reference:** "Iâ€™ve got nothing to hide and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy" by Daniel Solove

- **Problem:**
  - Anonymous searches may not be as anonymous as one thinks.
  - Example: AOL user 4417749, identified as Ms. Thelma Arnold from Lilburn, Georgia.

- **Opportunity:**
  - Vast amounts of data
  - Significant noise
  - Potential to find "interesting" information faster by combining:
    - Data Mining/Screen Scraping
    - Named Entity Recognition
    - Data Visualization

---

### Named Entity Recognition
- **Definition:** Parsing data to extract and classify information.
- **Example:**
  - Input: "Greg bought 300,000 shares of LIGATT in 2010."
  - Output: Greg (Person), 300,000 (Quantity), LIGATT (Organization), 2010 (Date)

---

### Data Visualization Process
- **Steps:**
  1. Acquire
  2. Parse
  3. Filter
  4. Mine
  5. Represent
  6. Refine
  7. Interact

### Example: Tony Hawk Twitter Hunt vs. Maltego
- **Objective:** Map the locations of hidden items in a scavenger hunt.
- **Process:**
  1. List the hiders (friends of @hidingit).
  2 . Derive @HidingIt.
  3. Search tweets.
  4. Convert to Twitter affiliations.
  5. Identify friends of the person.
  6. Analyze tweets written by the person.
- **Challenges:**
  - Twitter API limitations (e.g., 200 tweet limit, 150 API calls per hour).
  - Whitelisting considerations.

---

### Lessons Learned
1. **Plan Carefully:**
   - Set the speed/accuracy bar to the left until you know it works.
   - If results are sparse, check the speed/accuracy setting.
2. **Local Transforms:**
   - Open up new opportunities.
   - Consider server platforms for enterprise use.
   - Make a whitelisting request if heavily using the Twitter API.

### Case Study: Meet "Jess"
- **Scenario:**
  - Jess sells a laptop on an auction site.

  - Sends the laptop to a valid UK address.
  - Notified by the auction site that the buyer's account was hacked.
  - Contacts the police.
- **Hypothesis:**
  - Determine the location of the scammer.
  - Obtain email headers, but the scammer uses webmail.
