**Migrated issue, originally created by Johannes Erdfelt (@jerdfelt)**
sqlite treats unique indexes and unique constraints as distinct entities.
However, only indexes are reflected and unique constraints aren't.
This is different than mysql (which aliases unique constraints to a unique
index) and postgresql (which has distinct unique indexes and unique
constraints).
The attached script shows the problem.
