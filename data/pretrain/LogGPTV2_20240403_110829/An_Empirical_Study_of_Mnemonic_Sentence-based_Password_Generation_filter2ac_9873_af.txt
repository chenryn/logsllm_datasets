them. Furthermore, any difference should affect all groups in one
study equally, and should not affect comparisons between groups
within each study.
One potential concern is that because password creation in Study
1 was not set up in a way that exactly reﬂects a real-world password
creation scenario, the created passwords might not reﬂect what the
users would have used in real-world scenarios. We acknowledge
that such concerns are valid, although we would argue that the
main conclusions comparing the security under different variants
remain meaningful. The instructions are explicit and appear to be
new to most of the participants. Thus what passwords the partic-
ipants would create should be mostly affected by the instructions,
and the additional inﬂuence of whether they were told that they
would come back in one week is likely to be limited, especially be-
cause the instructions already explicitly ask participants to choose
memorable sentences.
Low password recall rates. In Study 2, we observed a seemingly
high failure rates in password recall in all groups (about 56% in
the control group). We believe that several factors contributed to
this failure rate. First, we asked participants not to use their current
passwords because we will record them, and it is likely that the
passwords generated in the studies were freshly created. Second,
participants did not use this password for one week, before they
were asked to recall it. It is unclear to us whether the failure rate
we have observed is indeed excessively high under such conditions.
Imagine that a user created a fresh password that is unrelated to her
existing passwords for a website, and was then asked to login at the
site after one week without any usage of the password in between.
What would be the failure rate in such a situation? It is likely to
be quite high, although how high it is is an open question. We are
unaware of documented failure rates in such situations.
Intuitively, most password-based authentication systems in real
world do not have such a high failure rate as observed in our study.
Some possible reasons are (a) most users use existing passwords
(or simple variants) for a new account, (b) some users rely on pass-
word managers (e.g., those provided by browsers), (c) some sites
are visited more frequently immediately after the accounts are cre-
ated (thus users have more frequent rehearsal).
It is well known that memorability of passwords is highly corre-
lated with the frequency of password use. For instance, the posi-
tive impact of repeated login of secrets (e.g., passwords) has been
demonstrated in a study by Bonneau and Schechter [10]: Following
a rigorous but carefully designed login schedule (i.e., spaced repe-
tition), a large number of study participants (i.e., 88%) were able to
effectively recall an encoded random 56-bit binary string. Further-
more, to promote successful recall of passwords, some password
management strategies have built-in rehearsal schedules [5, 6].
In an online study conducted on MTurk by Shay et al. [34], the
password retention rate was about 80%. However, their study has
two differences from our Study 2. First, in [34] participants were
not explicitly asked to create fresh passwords, and were simply
asked to create passwords that satisfy certain composition policies.
Also, the temporal distance between password recall and password
creation in [34] was 2 days, while ours is about 1 week. Empirical
evidence from memory research robustly suggests that long-term
memory declines over time [42].
In summary, the absolute numbers of the recall failure rates may
not be very informative. However, since the conditions are equiv-
alent for all groups, our results regarding the between-group com-
parisons should still be valid.
Writing passwords down.
In Study 2, whether passwords had
been written down was based on participants’ response to our ver-
iﬁcation question, and we are relying on the honesty of the par-
ticipants. It is unclear whether more reliable veriﬁcation methods
exist. Although we cannot verify users’ responses, we asked the
question after the password recall phase and explicitly pointed out
that their answer would not affect payment to remove any incen-
tive of deceiving. Of course we can never rule out the possibility
that some users wrote down their passwords and then lied, which
would mean that the real password recall rates are even lower than
what we have observed. Again, any impact of deceiving should be
similar for all groups.
Management of passwords for multiple accounts. In a real-life
setting, a user is likely required to create and recall passwords for
multiple accounts. Password reuse is often considered bad practice
and discouraged in advices for passwords. Creating and manag-
ing multiple strong passwords, however, yield a phenomenon for
the users called the password overload. Password overload alludes
to the users’ inherent inability to successfully recall passwords for
multiple accounts due to memory interference (i.e., failure to recall
an item that is similar to items stored in the memory) [4]. The ef-
fect of memory interference has also been observed in the context
of graphical passwords [16]. In Study 2, we asked users to create
and recall only one password. The study did not address the issue
of memory interference. It is an intriguing open research question
whether using the mnemonic sentence-based strategy would make
remembering multiple passwords easier or harder.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the security of 6 variants of the
mnemonic password generation strategy. For two of them, we also
evaluated memorability after 1 week. We showed that using the
standard cracking-based methodology, password sets obtained un-
der all variants have similar strengths and are all much more se-
cure than the baseline. However, using β-guess-rates, we found
that different instructions have a tremendous impact on the security
level of the resulting passwords. In particular, the instructions for
the mnemonic strategy found in the literature and recommended by
security experts are not optimal at inducing secure password dis-
tributions. However, combining explicit instructions of choosing a
personalized sentence that is unlikely to be chosen by others, with
the inclusion of corresponding examples, dramatically increased
the security of the resulting passwords, without observable nega-
tive impacts on usability.
