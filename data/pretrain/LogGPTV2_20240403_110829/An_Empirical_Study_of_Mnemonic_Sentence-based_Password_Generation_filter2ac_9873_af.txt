#### Differences in Study Groups
Any differences should uniformly affect all groups within a single study, and should not influence comparisons between groups within that study.

#### Potential Concerns in Password Creation
One potential concern is that the password creation process in Study 1 did not exactly replicate a real-world scenario. As a result, the passwords created might not reflect what users would choose in actual situations. While this concern is valid, we argue that the main conclusions comparing security under different variants remain meaningful. The instructions were clear and novel to most participants. Therefore, the passwords created were primarily influenced by the instructions, and any additional influence from being told they would return in one week is likely minimal, especially since the instructions explicitly asked participants to choose memorable sentences.

#### Low Password Recall Rates in Study 2
In Study 2, we observed a high failure rate in password recall across all groups (approximately 56% in the control group). Several factors likely contributed to this high failure rate:
1. Participants were instructed not to use their current passwords due to recording, so the passwords generated were newly created.
2. Participants did not use these passwords for one week before being asked to recall them.

It is unclear whether the observed failure rate is excessively high under these conditions. For example, if a user creates a new, unrelated password for a website and is asked to log in after one week without using the password, the failure rate could be quite high. However, the exact rate remains an open question, as there is limited documentation of such scenarios.

#### Real-World Password Recall
Intuitively, most real-world password-based authentication systems do not experience such high failure rates. Possible reasons include:
- Users often reuse existing passwords or simple variants for new accounts.
- Some users rely on password managers (e.g., those provided by browsers).
- New accounts are frequently accessed immediately after creation, providing more opportunities for rehearsal.

The correlation between memorability and frequency of password use is well-documented. For instance, Bonneau and Schechter [10] demonstrated that repeated logins, following a spaced repetition schedule, significantly improved recall of encoded random 56-bit binary strings. Additionally, some password management strategies incorporate built-in rehearsal schedules [5, 6].

In an online study conducted on MTurk by Shay et al. [34], the password retention rate was about 80%. However, their study differed from ours in two key ways: participants were not explicitly asked to create fresh passwords and the temporal distance between password creation and recall was only 2 days, compared to our 1-week interval. Memory research consistently shows that long-term memory declines over time [42].

In summary, while the absolute numbers of recall failure rates may not be highly informative, the consistent conditions across all groups ensure that our between-group comparisons remain valid.

#### Writing Passwords Down
In Study 2, whether participants wrote down their passwords was based on their responses to a verification question, and we relied on their honesty. It is unclear if more reliable verification methods exist. Although we cannot verify their responses, we asked the question after the password recall phase and explicitly stated that their answers would not affect payment, removing any incentive to deceive. Of course, it is possible that some participants wrote down their passwords and lied, which would mean the actual password recall rates are even lower than observed. Any impact of deception should be similar across all groups.

#### Managing Multiple Passwords
In real-life settings, users often need to create and recall passwords for multiple accounts. Password reuse is generally discouraged, but managing multiple strong passwords can lead to "password overload," where users struggle to recall passwords due to memory interference [4]. This effect has also been observed in graphical passwords [16]. In Study 2, participants were asked to create and recall only one password, so the issue of memory interference was not addressed. It remains an open research question whether using mnemonic sentence-based strategies would make remembering multiple passwords easier or harder.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated the security of six variants of the mnemonic password generation strategy. For two of these, we also evaluated memorability after one week. Using standard cracking-based methodology, we found that password sets obtained under all variants had similar strengths and were much more secure than the baseline. However, using Î²-guess-rates, we discovered that different instructions significantly impacted the security level of the resulting passwords. Specifically, the instructions for the mnemonic strategy recommended by security experts were not optimal for inducing secure password distributions. Combining explicit instructions to choose a personalized sentence unlikely to be chosen by others, with corresponding examples, dramatically increased the security of the resulting passwords without negatively impacting usability.
