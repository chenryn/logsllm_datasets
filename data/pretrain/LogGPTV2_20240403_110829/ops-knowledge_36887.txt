User: The available space of the existing three-disk array is insufficient and needs to be expanded. Please provide the expansion plan and specific operation steps.
Assistant: Capacity expansion plan: 1. Add more hard disks to the three-disk array: This is the easiest way, just add more hard disks to the three-disk array, and use the RAID level to utilize the space of these new hard disks. However, this may require data migration and RAID reconfiguration. 2. Replace the existing hard disk: You can choose to replace the existing hard disk with a larger capacity hard disk. This method usually requires data migration, but does not require RAID reconfiguration. 3. Use expansion equipment: Three-disk arrays usually have expansion slots, and special expansion equipment can be used to increase storage capacity. This method does not require data transfer and RAID reconfiguration. Specific operation steps: 1. Determine the expansion plan, including how many new hard disks need to be added or what expansion equipment to use. 2. In the three-disk array management interface, check the existing hard disk status, especially the RAID level and capacity usage. 3. According to the expansion plan, install a new hard disk or expand the device to the three-disk array. 4. In the three-disk array management interface, add a new hard disk or expand the device in the three-disk array, and configure RAID to make the new space available. 5. Scan the new hard disk or expansion device in the operating system and allocate it as new storage space to provide more free space in the existing data. 6. If a new RAID level is used, back up the data and rebuild the file system to reflect the changes. 7. Carefully monitor the performance and availability of the three-disk array, especially in the early stages after capacity expansion, to determine whether configuration needs to be adjusted to optimize performance.
