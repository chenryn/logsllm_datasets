Moreover, due to the self-calibration characteristic of Qi standard,
the adversary has to inject malicious messages continuously at a
very high frequency to ensure the attack is effective. The trans-
mitter can thus monitor the message receiving rate and terminate
the charging process once a sudden increase is detected. Wire-
less charger identification\authentication could be also possible
to defend against hijacking attacks, though additional efforts are
required in detecting the successfully injected Qi messages on the
charger’s primary coil. A recent study [53] showed that it could
identify wireless chargers via fingerprinting based on the intrinsic
nonlinear distortion effects of the underlying charging circuit. We
will also follow this to explore if we could use these fingerprints at
the circuit level to design a more resilient charging system.

For the eavesdropping attack, besides adding irregular noises
on the primary coil voltage, another possible procedure is to add
light-weight encryption mechanisms (e.g., lightweight block ci-
phers, hash functions [41], and AES [16]) to the Qi communication
channel, which helps avert Qi messages from being eavesdropped.
Some other existing studies [1, 18, 19, 54, 55] proposed to chaoti-
cally regulate the frequency of the power source to encrypt the
energy, so that only legitimate power receivers can acquire the
energy. As Qi uses AM modulation to modulate data bits on its
carrier signal, we can possibly leverage this chaotic frequency reg-
ulation technique in a reverse way to protect the Qi messages (kind
of energy) sent from the charging device to the charger. We leave
these potential approaches as our future work.
9 DISCLOSURE
We are working with the industry to resolve the identified threats.
We have already informed the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) [47]
of the potential security and privacy threats of Qi wireless charging.
The fix of the identified threats is ongoing.
10 RELATED WORK
Security and Privacy Threats on Wired Charging. Due to the
limited lifespan of smartphone batteries, a number of USB charging
stations have been set up in public areas, such as airports, hotels,
and hospitals, etc. Although these charging stations provide a great
convenience, existing studies [23, 24, 42, 50, 51] have shown that the
charging stations also expose users to serious privacy threats. For
instance, Mactans [24] showed the success of deploying malware
on iOS devices within one minute of being plugged into a malicious
USB wall charger. Tian et al. [43] demonstrated AT commands
issued through USB charging interfaces can launch various types of
attacks on Android devices (e.g., unlock screens, inject touch events).
KeySweeper [23] uses a malicious USB wall charger to passively
sniff, decrypt, and log all keystrokes from wireless keyboards in the
vicinity. Moreover, Yang et al. [51] showed that webpage browsing
activity (i.e., which webpages are loaded) on smartphones while the
phone is being charged can be collected via power trace analysis.
Relying on the power consumption information, Yang et al. [50]
also proposed a new attack on Tor to identify which website is being
visited. Spolaor et al. [42] demonstrated the potential of using a
(power-only) USB charging cable to exfiltrate data (e.g., IMEI, and
contacts’ phone number) from a smartphone through installing a
malicious app on the device. Additionally, Meng et al. proposed a
set of juice filming attacks which can automatically monitor and
record the phone screen during the charging process [28–30].
Security and Privacy Threats on Wireless Charging. Com-
pared with the security research on wired charging, the research
efforts in exploring the vulnerabilities of wireless charging are still
in the early stage. Several studies explored the security and safety
issues of wireless powered communication networks. For instance,
Dai et al. [9] proposed an algorithm that maximize the charging
utility of far-field, radio frequency-based wireless rechargeable
sensor networks (WRSNs), while assuring human safety under
the electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Lin et al. [25] pro-
posed a denial-of-charging attack on WRSNs for wireless charging
vehicles. Through generating fake charging requests, the attack
can make the rechargeable sensor nodes in the network exhaust
faster than usual. Moreover, Niyato et al. [32, 33] formulated the-
oretical models (e.g., game theoretic models) in wireless powered
communication networks to analyze the energy request and data
transmission policy under jamming attacks. Additionally, given the
security requirements in many applications, such as preventing
unauthorized electric vehicles (EVs) from obtaining the energy, sev-
eral studies [18, 19, 54, 55] proposed energy encryption mechanisms
to ensure the power is only transmitted to an authorized receiver.
There has been limited discussion on security and privacy threats
of these wireless charging systems. Regarding wireless charging for
mobile devices, few studies have investigated its underlying vulner-
abilities. A survey paper [27] only briefly mentioned the possibility
of launching eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks against
Qi. Neither technical details nor proof-of-concept experiments were
provided. The discussion on eavesdropping attack was only limited
to identity leakage (i.e., the manufacture of the smartphone), while
the possibility of hijacking attacks and revealing more sensitive
private information such as smartphone’s activities have not been
discussed. Roychowdhury [37] proposed an encryption method
to protect the transmitted communication packets (i.e., ID & C
packets) via simulation, while Yang et al. [49] proposed QID, a sys-
tem which could identify different charging devices leveraging the
unique features extracted from coil activities. Similar to the survey
paper [27], only identity leakage had been taken into consideration
in these papers. In general, the underlying threats of Qi wireless
charging deserve to have greater attention.
Different from existing studies, we want to bring to public atten-
tion the potential vulnerabilities of wireless charging, particularly
Qi wireless charging for mobile devices, to prioritize its mitigations
under attacks. We analyze Qi standard from both security and pri-
vacy perspectives and demonstrate the capability of an adversary
to take over the entire charging process and infer various phone
activities while it is being charged.
11 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we conducted the first thorough study to explore
the potential security and privacy vulnerabilities of Qi wireless
charging. We demonstrated that due to the open propagation char-
acteristic of electromagnetic signals, the Qi communication channel
can be easily hijacked by injecting malicious Qi messages through
stealthy placement of an adversarial coil on the charger. Addition-
ally, an adversary is capable of snooping Qi messages transmitted
between the wireless charger and the charging device to further
detect and identify the device’s activities (e.g., incoming phone
calls and messages from different apps) while being charged. We
validated that the adversary can reduce charging efficiency, stop
power transfer, cause overcharging, which may lead to significant
damage to the battery by injecting malicious Qi messages. More-
over, extensive experiments using multiple different commodity
smartphones and 14 commonly used social apps demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed eavesdropping attack.
