User: Let's say I have a file foo.py, and within the file I want to execute a file bar.py. But, bar.py isn't in the same directory as foo.py, it's in a subdirectory call baz. Will execfile work? What about os.system?
Assistant: import sys,
change "sys.path" by appending the path during run time,then import the module that will help
