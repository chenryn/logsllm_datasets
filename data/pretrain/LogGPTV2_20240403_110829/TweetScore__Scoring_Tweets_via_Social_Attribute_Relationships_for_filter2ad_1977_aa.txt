ABSTRACT
The spammers have been grossly detrimental since the inception of
Twitter social networks and keep polluting social environments by
hiding themselves among a large amount of normal users. In this
paper, we aim to address two challenges existing in the spammer de-
tection problem: 1) monitoring tweets that have a higher probability
of including spam messages; 2) providing an accurate solution for
spam classification. To address these two challenges, we first pro-
pose a pseudo-honeypot framework for efficient tweets monitoring
and collection. By taking advantage of users’ diversity and select-
ing normal users as the parasitic body, the pseudo-honeypot can
harness normal users with features having much more potentials of
attracting spammers. This lets the pseudo-honeypot collect tweets
that are far more likely to include spam messages. Furthermore,
we design a novel spam classification solution called TweetScore
by exploring both the intrinsic attributes’ and users’ relationships
in social networks. TweetScore quantifies such relationships into
a vector of numerical values to represent each tweet’s score, re-
flecting the associated user’s behaviors. The neural network is
then employed to take these vectors as input to classify spams
and spammers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
the efficiency of the pseudo-honeypot system on spam monitoring
and the accuracy of TweetScore on spam classification. Specifically,
the spam and spammer ratios collected by our pseudo-honeypot
system are four times as much as those of a non pseudo-honeypot
counterpart while the TweetScore can achieve, on an average, 93.5%
accuracy, 93.71% precision, and 1.52% false positive in online spam
classification.

1 INTRODUCTION
The spammers have been the adversary to Twitter networks, per-
sistently polluting social networking environments. By imitating
normal user behaviors, spammers can create social relationships
with other users and send unsolicited messages or requests, includ-
ing the malware URLs, advertising, phishing, deceptive information,
and others. Such harmful messages or requests can spread into the
entire social network to target victims, thus significantly degrad-
ing the quality of user experience, stealing sensitive information,
causing economic loss, and even changing victim’s political opin-
ions [17, 30]. Therefore, both the research community and social
network providers are devoting considerable efforts to develop var-
ious solutions [5, 29, 31, 33, 34, 39] for spammer capturing so as to
achieve clean and healthy social environments.
Spammers hide among a large amount of normal users, thereby
difficult to be mined and classified. To capture spams or spammers,
there are two challenges that need to be addressed. First, as there
are billions of users exiting in Twitter networks and an average
of 8, 351 tweets are posting every second [26], it is unrealistic to
process the entire dataset of Twitter users and their tweets. The
most practical and efficient way is to collect a subset of tweets (or
users) that include a large portion of spam messages (or spammers).
But how to collect such a subset of the dataset, especially in a
real-time manner, is vastly challenging. Second, as the spammers’
behaviors and postings are hidden in a large number of benign
tweets, how to classify spam messages and associated spammers
efficiently from them while guaranteeing high accuracy remains an
open problem. Especially nowadays, the spammers keep sending
non-spam messages or evolve with smart spammer techniques to
hide themselves.
Many research efforts have been devoted to analyzing the large
set of arbitrarily and blindly monitored tweets. These works [6, 8,
12, 20, 34] mainly focus on extracting features from users or tweets
and perform classification through learning-based classifiers based
on the disparity of attributes among spammers and normal users.
Session 5A: Web SecurityAsiaCCS ’19, July 9–12, 2019, Auckland, New Zealand379This line of solutions can classify spam messages or spammers
to some extent, but the efficiency and accuracy are limited. The
reason is that they worked on blindly collected tweets, where the
workload is extremely high and yet the ratios of captured spams
or spammers are relatively low. More importantly, such analytical
work extracts features from either users’ or tweets’ contents and
then employs the machine learning classifiers to train attributes
independently. However, the intrinsic relationships among users
as well as their attributes, that have rich information to reflect
spammer’s behaviors, are not explored yet.
On the other hand, the honeypot-based spammer capturing meth-
ods [18, 19, 28, 36] have been promising for trapping spammers
by manually deploying honeypots with specific features meeting
spammer’s taste. As a result, analytical work on collected users
and tweets is significantly reduced. But such a method requires
lots of efforts on manual setup, which leads to high deployment
overhead. Moreover, some attributes are hard and even impossi-
ble to be equipped in artificially created accounts, e.g., creating a
honeypot account with a 3-year history. Thus, honeypot solutions
unavoidably have the essential drawbacks on deployment flexibility,
feature diversity, and network scalability. Besides, their analytical
work for spammer classification fails to consider intrinsic relation-
ships among users as well as their attributes. Another line of works
[4, 10, 13, 32, 35, 37, 38] have been proposed to analyze user rela-
tionships to explore spammer’s (called Sybil) behaviors. Through
modeling friend and follower relationships in social networks by a
graph, they relied on graph-based techniques to characterize users’
intrinsic relationships so as to classify each user as a Sybil node or
not. However, these works only focus on exploring users’ relation-
ships but the attributes’ relationships, which include much richer
information to reflect spammer’s behaviors, are still totally left out.
In this paper, we first propose the pseudo-honeypot as a novel
system framework for users monitoring and tweets collection, with
the aim to capture tweets that have much more potentials of includ-
ing spam messages. The proposed pseudo-honeypot framework
harnesses normal users as the parasitic body while taking advantage
of those users’ diversity and utilizing their associated features as the
key resources to attract spammers. By selecting a set of users that
have the features of meeting spammer’s taste, the pseudo-honeypot
can monitor these users’ neighboring activities and collect tweets
that are more likely to be spam messages. Although the pseudo-
honeypot harnesses normal users, the monitoring activities can be
controlled in a way that is completely transparent to them and other
Twitter users, so as to comply with Twitter terms of the privacy
policy. Obviously, the pseudo-honeypot can perform similarly as
honeypot on trapping spammers while advancing it in multiple
perspectives. It has the salient advantages on deployment flexibility,
features variability, and network scalability. Besides, analyzing its
collected users and their posting tweets can be significantly quicker
while improving the captured spam or spammer ratios.
We then design a new solution, named TweetScore, to classify
spam messages over collected tweets. Our solution aims to analyze
both users and attributes relationships to reflect tweets’ charac-
teristics and then use these relationships to score tweets for spam
classification. In particular, we extract the “mention” relationships
among users and use them to model user’s relationships for con-
structing an Activity Graph. At each user, we identify the associated
attributes and leverage the Activity Graph to construct the attribute
relationship graph, called an Attribute Graph. With both graphs, we
develop a solution based on the “mention” frequency, UV matrix
decomposition, and PageRank algorithm [16] to predict and score at-
tribute relationships (i.e., edges) and attribute values (i.e., vertices).
Meanwhile, we use the Random Walk algorithm [11] to extract the
neighboring user relationships (i.e., walk l steps) and then represent
these relationships as attribute scores to quantify each tweet’s at-
tributes. In parallel, we also use the Random Walk results to model
the users’ relationships and quantify such relationships into two
vectors, i.e., sender vector and receiver vector. We consolidate the
attribute scores vector, sender vector, and receiver vector to form
a tweet’s score vector. Such a vector can reflect both the relevant
users’ relationships and attributes’ relationships of the associated
tweet. The neural network is then employed, taking the tweet score
vectors as the input, to further mine the deeper intrinsic attributes
and users relationships for training before deployed to classify each
tweet as a spam or non-spam.
The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows:
• We propose the pseudo-honeypot as a novel system frame-
work and advocate it for efficient spams monitoring in Twit-
ter social networks. The proposed pseudo-honeypot brings
salient advantages on development flexibility, features avail-
ability, and network scalability when compared to the tradi-
tional honeypot-based solutions. By leveraging the pseudo-
honeypot, we collect the set of tweets that have a much
higher probability of including both spams and spammers.
Experimental results confirm that spammer ratios captured
by pseudo-honeypot are four times as much as those of using
a non pseudo-honeypot counterpart.
• We design TweetScore as a novel spam classification solution
by analyzing both neighboring users and attributes rela-
tionships to explore the unique characteristics of spams and
spammers. With such relationships quantified by vectors, the
neural network model is employed to train the relationship
among neighboring users and attributes. This method out-
performs previous solutions where users and their attribute’s
relationships are rarely analyzed, despite such intrinsic rela-
tionships likely provide much richer information that reflects
the disparity of spammer and non-spammer behaviors.
• We implement the proposed pseudo-honeypot system and
TweetScore solution for online spam detection in Twitter net-
work. By conducting extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that TweetScore can achieve, on an average, 93.5% accuracy,
93.71% precision, and 1.52% false positive in online spammer
detection. Moreover, we show the advantages of TweetScore
in terms of spammers detection over previous methods.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we discuss our problem and give the necessary definitions. Sec-
tion 3 presents the system design of pseudo-honeypot and Section 4
proposes a novel spam classification solution, i.e., TweetScore, and
describes its detailed designs. In Section 5, we implement both
the proposed pseudo-honeypot system and TweetScore solution
in Twitter networks while conducting extensive experiments to
demonstrate the performance of pseudo-honeypot network and the

tion, respectively. We conclude our paper in Section 6.
2 PROBLEM STATEMENT AND DEFINITION
2.1 Problem Statement
This paper studies the spams gathering and spammers detection
problem in Twitter social networks. We aim to propose a new sys-
tem framework for monitoring and collecting tweets that have a
higher probability of containing spam messages, and then design
a novel solution to classify these tweets as spams or non-spams.
There are two challenges to be solved in this problem. First, since
the number of tweets postings in Twitter networks is enormous, it
is unrealistic to filter all tweets for spam detection due to excessive
workload. To address this challenge, we focus on the users that have
more potentials of attracting spammer’s interest and present a novel
framework, called pseudo-honeypot, to harness these normal users
while keeping transparency to them. This novel pseudo-honeypot
framework enables us to take advantage of users’ diversity (in-
cluding user types, behaviors, features, and others) and leverage
such diversity to attract spammers, without manually creating the
artificial honeypots but performing similarly to the honeypot. The
goal of pseudo-honeypot is to capture tweets that are more likely
to include spam messages instead of blindly collecting tweets for
classification.
On the other hand, since most of the tweets posted by spammers
are benign messages (for the covert purpose), it is challenging for
traditional attribute methods (i.e., extract independent attributes or
text mining) to find them. In this paper, we focus on the “mention”
activities included in each tweet and propose to analyze the rele-
vant user and attribute relationships associated with it. The reason
is that the “mention” activities include the most severe spammer
behaviors, which thus provide much valuable information to gar-
ner spammers. The “mention” relationships from the tweets will
be extracted to construct the Activity Graph and Attribute Graph,
respectively. Based on these two graphs, we will develop new so-
lutions to explore both tweet attributes’ and users’ relationships
while quantifying such relationships into a vector of numerical
values (i.e., score), so as to mine the discrepancy of spammer and
normal users. We introduce a novel solution called TweetScore to
implement such solution for spam classification.
