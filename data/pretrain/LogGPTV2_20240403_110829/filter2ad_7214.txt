Automotive Enhanced Vision Systems - Issues
Arising from Placing Users in the Loop

General Motors, Research & Development
It is well known that Enhanced Vision Systems (EVS) improve pilot situational awareness and assist flight task
performance, making them a firmly established flight deck technology in the Avionics domain. While similar
technologies hold the promise of bringing parallel benefits to the everyday driver, Automotive EVS is current a
nascent technology for numerous reasons. In this presentation, a unique Automotive EVS system will be described
and several concept applications will be reviewed. Subsequently, a set of issues that emerge from the nature of user(cid:173)
system interaction, the unique features of the automotive domain and associated system -ilities. Included in this
discussion are aspects of system reliability, system availability, user acceptability, user adaptability and the
important task of building user trust through reliable and hierarchical importance ranking and management of
information presented on Automotive EVS.
Speaker:
Tom is the Lab Group Manager of the Human Machine Interface group within the Vehicle Development Research
Lab at GM in Warren Michigan. He is responsible for developing next generation interfaces that enable safer, more
efficient and pleasurable human interactions with GM vehicle interiors. This technical domain is comprised of User
Centered Design process development, use of Design Language for brand differentiation and harmonious
experience, in addition to the traditional focus of information management, display and control, and user human
factors/usability testing.
In addition to holding a PhD in Physical Chemistry from Northwestern University, Tom has an MBA from the
University of Iowa. He began his career at the Rockwell Science Center where he developed high energy density
materials for use as propellants and chemical laser fuels. From there he transferred to Rockwell Collins to lead
organizations in the development of avionics HMI and display technologies. There, he ascended to the position of
Air Transport Director of Technology and Product Planning. Tom then joined Guardian Industries Science Center as
the Director of Sputtered Films Technology, leading an organization charged with developing thin film optics
technologies and products. Finally, he was the Director of Advanced Technology at Guardian prior to joining GM in
2006.
