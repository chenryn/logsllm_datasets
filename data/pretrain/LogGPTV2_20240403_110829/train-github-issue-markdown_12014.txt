If I place Grid inside a Collapse component, it doesn't expand and collapse
smoothly. It expands a little more than needed and then collapses a bit back.
Is that a bug? Or is there some workaround to use Grid inside collapsible part
of the UI? Thanks.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Expand and collapse smoothly like it does without Grid inside
