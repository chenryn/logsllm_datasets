Fig. 3. Measurement Topology Setup
Fig. 4. Cisco’s default RFD values
Figure 3 shows our measurement infrastructure. Router r0 is directly connected to
a large public Internet Exchange over which it receives both full and partial feeds. In
addition, the router connects to a global tier-1 provider for another full BGP feed.
We pulled statistics from the router at regular intervals for one week, from Septem-
ber 29 through October 6, 2010, using the clogin command from the rancid tool. Data
included details of all route ﬂap damping counters, although the router code did not
actually damp any route. The time to pull the data from the router depended on how
quickly the router responded to our queries, but was typically in the order of 4–5 min-
utes. Missing counter values due to slow router response time did not signiﬁcantly af-
fect our observations in subsequent sections, as there were very few of them. The 95%
quantile was under ten minutes. However, in some circumstances it was longer, up to
45 minutes in one instance! We believe this was due to CPU utilization peaks.
4 Results
We investigate the penalty values assigned to the preﬁxes received by our modiﬁed router,
r0 (Figure 3). We then provide recommendations for new RFD parameter settings.
Figure 5 shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the penalties as-
signed to preﬁxes by the router during the one week experiment. Let us assume there
are n snapshots during the week’s experiment. We deﬁne an ‘instance’ ip,t as the RFD
penalty of preﬁx p in snapshot t. Figure 5 shows the proportion of instances with penal-
ties smaller than or equal to x over the whole set of instances. Intuitively, this is the
proportion of preﬁxes which would have been damped in the time-preﬁx-space.
We observe that 14% percent of the instances reached a penalty greater or equal to
2,000 in the measurement period. 2,000 is a critical threshold as this is the default value
for RFD suppression on Cisco routers. This gives a feeling for how ‘bad’ it is, if one
turns on default RFD those instances would have been damped. Further, we observe in
Figure 5 that a suppress threshold of 4,000, 5,000 and 6,000 leads to the damping of
4.2%, 2.8% and 2.1% of the instances respectively. The number of damped instances
decreases very quickly. Finally, we note that very few of the preﬁxes are assigned a
very high penalty. Only 0.63%, 0.44% and 0.32% have a penalty value above 12,000,

Fig. 6. CDF of the proportion of preﬁxes with
penalty values above a threshold
15,000 and 18,000, respectively. Thus, very few preﬁxes ﬂap heavily for long in the
time-preﬁx-space. However, we observed earlier that those few preﬁxes are responsible
for a disproportionate part of the BGP churn. The maximum penalty value assigned to
a route during the experiment was 48,000. This value is huge compared to the median
penalty of 818 (Fn(818)=0.5).
We recommend conservative operators set the ‘suppress threshold’ to 12,000,
15,000 or 18,000, as these values likely penalize only the very heavy hitters. We show
later that, while values in the range [12,000− 18,000] enable a non negligible BGP up-
date rate reduction, a suppress threshold in the range [4,000− 6,000] damps far fewer
preﬁxes compared to current defaults and the BGP update rate is signiﬁcantly reduced.
How long do preﬁxes typically stay at high penalty values? Figure 6 shows the CDF
of the durations a preﬁx is above a certain penalty value, and thus would be damped if
this was the threshold. The red solid curve shows the damping duration for the current
threshold of 2,000. Many preﬁxes have a penalty above 2,000 for a very short time.
For example, 68% of preﬁxes stay above 2,000 for up to one hour during the one week
of the experiment. This means the current default suppresses a lot of preﬁxes that are
unstable for a relatively short time. We suspect that many of those preﬁxes are inappro-
priately damped following a single event. They are given a penalty value above 2,000
during BGP convergence simply because of path exploration. We should not damp those
preﬁxes!
The other curves show suppression times for penalty values between 2K and 4K,
between 4K and 6K, 6K–12K, and above 12K relative to those preﬁxes in the 2K class.
If a preﬁx is not suppressed at all, then the duration is zero and thus the curve starts at
this point on the y-axis. Not surprisingly, the number of preﬁxes in each category varies
quite a lot (721 preﬁxes above 12K, top most curve; 4,429 preﬁxes between 6K–12K,
2nd from top; and 11,546 preﬁxes between 4K–6K, 3rd from top; and 44,846 preﬁxes
between 2K–4K, lowest curve). Furthermore, there are very few preﬁxes that have a
high penalty for a long time (e.g. rightmost points). There are 57 preﬁxes in the 2K–4K
band that stay in this band for more than two days, but only 12 preﬁxes in the above
12K-band that stay for more than two days. We noticed some preﬁxes change bands,
e.g., stay for a few hours/days in the 2K–4K band and then also stay a few hours/days
in a higher band. Overall, it is possible that high churn preﬁxes stay for quite some
Route Flap Damping Made Usable

time in lower bands; but we have also shown that ‘normal converging’ preﬁxes stay in
those bands. Therefore, we need to ﬁnd a trade-off in the parameter space, that does not
penalize preﬁxes that only experience path exploration.
Figure 7 shows the number of preﬁxes which would be damped given the different
candidate thresholds. Clearly, (32,089) mice would be spared using a suppress thresh-
old of 4,000 or above. Moreover, we see that the number of preﬁxes damped with
higher suppress thresholds does not vary much. High thresholds are much more suit-
able to prevent damping of preﬁxes affected by normal BGP path exploration than the
current default threshold. Our intuition here is that a ‘badly behaving preﬁx’ will ﬂap
for a long time and thus hit high penalty values; while ‘normal converging preﬁxes’,
which just receive multiple updates due to path exploration, will not be penalized.
