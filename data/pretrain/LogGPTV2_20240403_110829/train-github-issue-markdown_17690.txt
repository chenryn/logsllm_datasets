When attempting to start the `react-devtools` program using the command:

```sh
sudo npx react-devtools
```

I encounter the following error:

```sh
/usr/local/lib/node_modules/react-devtools/node_modules/electron/index.js:14
    throw new Error('Electron failed to install correctly, please delete node_modules/electron and try installing again')
    ^
Error: Electron failed to install correctly, please delete node_modules/electron and try installing again
    at getElectronPath (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/react-devtools/node_modules/electron/index.js:14:11)
```

Even after installing `react-devtools` globally with the command:

```sh
sudo npm install -g react-devtools
```

and then starting the program with:

```sh
sudo react-devtools
```

I still receive the same error.

### System Information:
- **Operating System:** Linux Mint 20 Cinnamon
- **react-devtools Version:** 4.8.2

### Steps I've Tried:
1. Installed `react-devtools` globally using `sudo npm install -g react-devtools`.
2. Attempted to start the program using both `sudo npx react-devtools` and `sudo react-devtools`.

### Error Message:
```sh
Error: Electron failed to install correctly, please delete node_modules/electron and try installing again
```

### Question:
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you!
