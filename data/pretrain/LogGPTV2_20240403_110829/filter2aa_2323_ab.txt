to enter again into those primitive languages. When we do, we
immediately feel the constraint of our childlike thinking binding us
like wet rawhide wrapped around, shrinking in the sun. The cul-
tures of Accidental Humankind had once been comfortably snug.
Then they grew tight and then they became suffocating. Time to
breathe. Time to be free. You would think we would have bolted for
the opening door and leaped from the edge of the cliff, but human-
kind is a funny duck. Even on the edge of surrendering, we experi-
enced the expansion of possibility as something to be resisted.

Humankind resisted it’s own destiny, even as it arrived. As if to
become more was in fact to become less.
It is no wonder then that traits like that were discarded and the
attitudes of the Nebular Drift, as they were called, those thousands
of trans-galactic cultures that had grown into a single Matrix, were
integrated instead into the way we made ourselves make ourselves.
The Hundred-and-Twelve was a single thread, humankind a reces-
sive gene in the deep pool of the Matrix.
Once we had engaged for millennia in multiple replication and
had manufactured the attributes we preferred, we were no longer at
the mercy of molecules that had piled up
willy-nilly to create an interesting but pot-bound species. And
along the way, you had better believe, now write this down! Yes, I
mean it! This is important. Along the way, we
made plenty of mistakes. Now we can see they’re what they(we)
called funny then. They can still be observed in a simulation of a
replication of a holographic set in the Skein that anyOne can access.
Unhappy humanitads unable to laugh, horse-laughing humanitoids
unable to think, chip-whipped hummans unable to dance. We did
not know that laughing and thinking and dancing made humans
human, then. The trick was getting the mix just right. And that, we
discovered through trial-and-error 
meant a mix that was right for the Skein, not just a species or planet
or galaxy. A mix that made the trans-Matrix a rich broth of diverse
possibilities. We became adept at pan-galactic speciation only when
we learned to think macro, manage multiple images of more than
millions of stars swarming with warm sentience. We finally identi-
fied consciousness, intensionality, and extenuation as hallmarks of a
mature being(people)-or:species and the necessary attributes of any
viable hive.

Consciousness is a field of possibility, self-luminous, unabstract-
ed, boundless. It is a way the wrinkles in a diaphanous fabric (as it
were) invite self-definition. Our subjectivity is our field of identity,
shaped by the Skein.
To review, then, my little ones:  We gave species names.
Thousands of cycles later we discerned a pattern of trans-galactic
distribution and nested disintermediation and called it a void Warp.
At last we called ourselves(=Self) the Skein and were ready to take
that first tentative step off our front porch.
We had expanded plenty by then, into ourSelves, hollowing
hundreds of inhabited galaxies, filling them with Nothing. We began
to understand that there was neither out nor in, there was only the
Skein becoming aware of itSelf. All of the names were arbitrary
vocables, but even that simple fact was beyond the capacity of a
human brain truly to grasp. I know, because I fed the primitives into
the simulated human mind and the Skein belched. So even as the
Skein continued to manifest itself at all levels, a remnant of humani-
ty like an eddy, a backwater, on a single planet continued like the tip
of a whorl of a swirling fractal to think one thing. The Skein, of
course, knew many things, but knew too they were really One.
How could we-it, how could the Skein, manifest at every level?
An excellent question! Because how we define the system depends,
dear ones, on the level at which we choose to observe it. Everything
is nested, connected. Yes. Messy and messless. Very good!
Well, my dearly beloveds, let us continue: The Skein was more
than context, the Skein was/izz the content of whatever we had no
longer happened to become. Now we became. Our languages frac-
tured once and for all when we tried to name ourSelf in the Skein.
Looking back at the nested levels of linguistic evolution, we can see
how we were spoken by our primitive language, all unconscious

that we were carried along for the long ride outward, oblivious to
how language was made. Then we learned how to make progeny
that made language that made progeny that made language and so
on and so on, down-a-thousand-thousand. Accidental Humanity
had to vanish, so do not grieve for what is only never lost .
We learned how to extend ourselves until we were singular, flexing
inside ourselves(ourSelf), our awareness nearly identical to the mo-
lecular enterprise we had chosen to become. When we look back or
across the translucent folds of the Skein or – as some say – when we
look into the Emptiness and see what we created out of Nothing …
no wonder the new skin/Skein growing all the while under the old
was experienced as something new, when in fact it was always the
Skein, a field of subjectivity within which we had always been
woven, always dimensioned. Yet even then, our arrogance persisted,
because the Skein was aware of itself as a journey moving outward
at increasing speeds, rather than a spiral closing in on itself.
The more matter was ingested and became the frame of the
evolving Skein, the less able the Skein became of saying anything at
all. The Skein fell into Mute, when the edges of the known universe
were discerned not in some simulation but as the finite-but-un-
bounded possibility of Skein itself. There was, after all, nothing more
to say; language no longer served a useful purpose. The numbers of
differentiated apertures through which the Skein experienced itself
had advanced to something like 2 to the 32nd power, but every single
one  was Skein and aware of itself as Skein. Except the
ones that weren’t, but they were Skein too.  The configuration of energy and informa-
tion that had animated itself so many millions of eons ago had
reached the near-term goal of expansion. As we understood or
defined it, of course.
We knew by then that we had chosen only one way to expand,

filling spacetime co-extensible with our awareness, we knew there
had been millions of other possibilities, each a perfectly good way of
being the Skein. But then we arrived at the edge of the front porch
for the first time and slipped going down and landed, whapht! on
our ass on the second step. We hadn’t seen it coming but (obviously)
in retrospect, it was inevitable.
What the Skein boldly called the Known Universe was in fact
merely a bubble of Froth that Second Contact dimensioned
some/what so immense that we had to regress, we were so confound-
ed by the Bigger Truth of it all, so aghast at the muchness of it, the
wildness of it, the sizes and sizes! We were like a child(Children)
called suddenly (prematurely? No, I did not say that) to advance to
a level of comprehension and self-responsibility unimaginable to
our little brain. So we stuck our thumb in our mouth and began
babbling. Yes, the Skein started speaking again, just before it disap-
peared.
We know now that the Skein had no choice, and of course, what
I call “speaking” resembles primitive utterable tongues as an explod-
ing galaxy resembles the darkness of a limestone cave in one of your
green hills. The Skein needed to differentiate itself in order to extend
itself through the aperture that disclosed new possibilities that the
Skein had been unable to imagine in its finite-but-unboundedness.
Now, of course, we just call it “reality.” Then, it blew the mind –
literally – of the Skein. Mind disappeared, and the Skein experienced
itself as a field of consciousness, unabstracted, self-luminous, bound-
less. More important, the Skein saw that it too was merely an emer-
gent reality, a Self as illusory as that which humanity had called
ourSelf/itSelf.
It had to happen. We know, we know it did. But forgive us please
a wispy remnant of wistful feeling. The way the Skein dreamed was
childlike. The Skein planned Little, while thinking it was thinking

Big. Now we understand  pause.  We met ourselves
in the Froth like a child with paper and pencil doing sums while the
Froth was more like oh, lets say a Supercomputer(s), a dimensionless
web of quantum computers that networked forever, indistinguish-
able from its means. The Froth was like an old Apple under a tree on
a morning of giving/receiving gifts. Or perhaps an entire planet
under a heaventree of stars wrapped in the fabric of spacetime. Oh,
more. More. The Skein reached its limit because it experienced the
Next Step as limitlessness, while the Skein had built itself to manage
only finite-but-unboundedness. However many possibilities we had
included in our/its schema, the fact that they could be numbered
however numberless the numbers was simply a careless mistake.
Back to the drawing board, boys and girls. Trial-and-error means
we make mistakes. Never forget. The Skein over-reached itself
through the aperture into the Froth and became the Asymmetric
Foam that now is flowing with growing confidence in its capacity to
enhance the possibilities that glow with nascent mentation on the
outer inner edges of the Froth. We are the emptiness of the Froth.
Our destiny has been to become Nothing. We understand at last (we
say with downcast eyes and chastened demeanor, knowing we
understand nothing, nothing at all, knowing that we are like chil-
dren standing on our front porch, looking down at our skinned
knees and the first step). The Froth looks to humankind in its plane-
tary crib like a hydra-headed fractal, the Skein like a bubble in the
Froth. We believe the Froth Knows Whereof it Speaks, while the
Skein, bless its heart, has outgrown its worn yellow one-piece sleep-
er. It is time for the Skein to buy itself a new suit.
And die to being the Skein forever. Yet within the Froth what was
the Skein meets and embraces what had been … even Our/its lan-
guage breaks, the billion Skein-like non-Skeins smiling inside out-
side at the sheer impossibility of saying anything at all. We are the

Froth and the Froth is evolving toward the Second Mute. But try.
 because humankind tries. Humankind tiny but laughs and
thinks and dances the Froth. Small and so adorable, humbled now,
humankind on its wee planet. Tip of a swirl. A swirl in a whorl of a
spiral.
Try. Try again.
The Froth however dimples, dimples again and gimbles, all mim-
sy as the Skein, laughing and dancing, ola! Loa! High! High! Leaps
over the fire to become twice blasted twice undone.
