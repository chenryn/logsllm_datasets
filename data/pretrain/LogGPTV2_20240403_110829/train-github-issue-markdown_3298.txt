**Current behavior**  
I'm subscribing to queryParam changes in a component in order to update and
save the app state based on it. Clicking on links, which points to the
different states works fine. Using the browsers back button for getting the
prev. state does not work in IE11 and Safari.
When I'm using the browser back button in IE 11 or Safari the code in my
component get's executed, but not reflected in the DOM. When I run the changes
inside the NgZone.run(callback) callback function, it get's reflected.
**Expected/desired behavior**  
Changes should get reflected in the DOM as happening in all the other
browsers.
**Reproduction of the problem**
  * Open your DevTools console
  * Click through the list randomly and take a look at the URL (?selectedIndex=1)
  * Use the browser's back button to get back to the prev. state and monitor the logging in the console.
  * The code gets executed but not reflected in the browsers DOM

A consistent behaviour through all the 'modern' browsers
