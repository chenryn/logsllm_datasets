axis at time iδ in the rotated angle trace. An intersection is
found if it satisﬁes all the following conditions:
1) Start turn: The angle change between time iδ and (i +
1)δ is higher than a threshold φg1, i.e., |zi+1−zi| > φg1,
which captures the event that the vehicle is starting to
make a turn or enter a curve.
2) Large deviation: The largest deviation on a slope under
investigation must be greater than a threshold φg2, i.e.,
maxi∈slope |zi+1 − zi| > φg2. This distinguishes the real
turn from a slight curve on the route.
3) Large turn angle: If the difference between the ﬁrst
and the last angle on a slope is greater than φg3, i.e.,
|zi+n − zi| > φg3, the slope is recognized as a real turn,
and the value αk = zi+n − zi is the turn angle for the
corresponding k-th intersection.
A curve is recognized if the ﬁrst condition is met, but the other
two conditions do not hold at the same time. In other cases,
the road segment under investigation is considered a straight
segment. The parameters φg1, φg2, and φg3 are conﬁgured
accordingly to the geographic area.
Idle State Detection: Despite the limited accuracy of the
accelerometer to reveal the precise instantaneous vehicular
speed, we can still exploit it to differentiate an idle state (e.g.,
vehicle stops at trafﬁc lights) from movement on a straight
road. In both cases,
the gyroscope does not expose large
enough variations for detecting angle changes with adequate
accuracy. However, with accelerometer, the former case results
in nearly zero magnitudes of acceleration vectors, while the
values are considerably larger with higher ﬂuctuations for the
latter case. With idle states detected, we can better estimate
the actual non-idle time and improve the attack performance.

iments for different smartphones.
For this justiﬁcation, we measure the accuracy based on real
driving experiments as follows. We use 4 smartphones of
different brands and models, and take total 70 driving routes in
both Boston and Waltham (Massachusetts, USA). To assess the
gyroscope errors, we extract the truth turn angles θi of taken
routes from OpenStreetMap, then for each θi, we obtain the
gyroscope angle αi (after sensor data processing phase) and
compute turn errors ei = αi − θi. As observed from Figure 5
showing histogram of ei, the error distribution for each phone
closely follows a normal distribution with more than 95%

of errors below 10

for 4 phones, the mean μ and standard deviation σ values are
0.003 and 7.54, respectively.

V. EVALUATION
B. Selection of Cities
In this section, we evaluate the attack efﬁciency based on
simulations and real driving experiments. First, we justify the
accuracy of gyroscope sensor and present our selection criteria
for cities chosen for evaluation. Subsequently, we present our
simulation and real driving results with a discussion on attack
performance and the implications on user privacy. The attack
parameters with default values are given in Table I.
A. Accuracy of Gyroscope
While the accelerometer and magnetometer accuracy de-
pend heavily on the environment rendering them more suitable
for ﬁltering improbable routes with relaxed rules, the gyro-
scope sensor is less impacted by the environment. Therefore,
it is important to ﬁrst justify the accuracy of gyroscope data.
To assess the attack’s impact on diverse cities of the world,
we identiﬁed 11 cities for simulations based on their size,
density and road structure. Table III summarizes their attack-
related characteristics such as the graph size (number of
vertices |V | and edges |E|) and distribution of turn angles
at intersections (mean μturn and standard deviation σturn).
Big cities such as Atlanta, Boston, London, Madrid, Paris,
and Rome create larger graphs than the rest according to our
construction method. While Manhattan is quite populated, it
has the smallest graph in our set, because our graph only
contains maximal-length segments. Nevertheless Manhattan is
dominated by long east-west and north-south roads, many of
which are parallel. Despite having similar graph size as Man-
hattan, Concord and Waltham are attributed to a larger standard

C. Creation of Simulated Routes
For each selected city, we test the feasibility of the attack
by running the system on simulated routes. In case of Boston
and Waltham, we also collect 70 driving experiments used for
experimental evaluation described in Section V-E. Both sets
of simulated and real routes are converted to the same format
for compatibility, in which the user’s route is represented as a
sequence U = ((h1, α1, t1, C 1), . . . , (hN , αN , tN , C N )). The
heading vector hi represents the direction of vehicle right
before entering an intersection with turn angle αi, whereas
ti and C i are the time duration and curvature of the travel
between the previous intersection and the next one.
Route Generation: Based on the constructed graph G = (V,
E) for a selected city G, each simulated route is created by ﬁrst
randomly choosing a route length N ← {4, . . . , 11}, then the
route is formed by adding N random connected segments that

Simulation Scenarios: To understand the attack perfor-
mance under various environments, our simulation evaluation
is performed and reported for different scenarios, in which
several noise parameters are adjusted from the above settings.

• Ideal: noise-free scenario (upper bound performance).

heavy trafﬁc and old smartphones with less accuracy.

= 0.5. In this scenario, we consider
moderate trafﬁc and current smartphones. Note that, σ =
8 is slightly higher than the experimental value σ = 7.54,
implying a slightly harder attack.
• Future: σ = 6, β
= 0.5. In this scenario, we consider
moderate trafﬁc and future smartphones equipped with
more accurate sensors as MEMs technology progresses.

D. Simulation Results
We evaluate the potential of the attack for all cities in Ta-
ble III using the 4 different scenarios speciﬁed in Section V-C.
In total, there are 44 test cases and for each, we generate a new
set of 2000 simulated routes. We use the same scoring weights
ωA = 2.5, ωT = 0.1, ωC = 2.5 for every city. These weights
are selected as they are relatively good for all cities, and our
main simulation goal is to evaluate the attack using the same
conﬁguration for different city proﬁles. Other parameters used
for the attack are speciﬁed in Table I. The attack outcome
is evaluated according to both individual rank and cluster
rank. For the latter metric, we choose the proximity threshold
Δ = 500 meters, which typically covers a few house blocks
or apartment buildings.
Figure 7 shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
of individual and cluster ranks (i.e., P idv and P clt) produced by
the attack. For the Typical scenario, we see that the system is
able to ﬁnd more than 50% (resp. 60%) of exact routes (resp.
clusters of routes) in the top 10 results for all cities except for
Atlanta, Berlin, and Manhattan. Even in the Worst scenario,
more than 35% (resp. 40%) of exact routes (resp. clusters)
