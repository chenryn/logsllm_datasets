User: Say I have a python application that I want to install and if I run python setup.py install --user, everything gets put into ~/.local as expected (on linux), and inside of that the stuff in ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
gets seen by the PYTHONPATH as expected; however, my executables that are created by setup.py (using either entry_points via setuptools or scripts via distutils) are correctly put into ~/.local/bin, but are not seen by the PATH at the command line. 
Thus, I have to add $HOME/.local/bin to my PATH (via my .zshrc) to get these executables seen by my environment.  I'm assuming this is the expected behaviour, but my question is, is there some way to get my executables "registered" with my PATH when I run the installation with the --user flag during the setup? 
I believe this should work, as I see that ipython does something like this, where if it's installed with the --user flag (into ~/.local), then you don't have to add to your path ~/.local/bin to get the local install of ipython seen at the command line. I just can't figure out how ipython does it. Many thanks in advance.
Assistant: Instead of using --user, why not use a virtualenv?  they are much more flexible, and put its bin directory on the path when activated.
Otherwise, manually putting ~/.local/bin on your PATH, as you did, is what you need to do.
