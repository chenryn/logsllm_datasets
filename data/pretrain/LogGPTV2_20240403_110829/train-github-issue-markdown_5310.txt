    Before filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the
    latest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the
    latest version of Go:
    Run "go version" and compare against
    http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html  If a newer version of Go exists,
    install it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.
    Thanks.
