User: Please write a network topology diagram and detailed device configuration instructions to ensure that all devices can communicate with each other and realize the function of accessing the Internet and internal resources.
Assistant: The network topology diagram is as follows: ![Network topology diagram](https://i.imgur.com/Fcwa27M.png) Device configuration instructions: 1. PC1, PC2, PC3: IP addresses are 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3 and 192.168 .1.4, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, the gateway is 192.168.1.1, and the DNS server is 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4. 2. Internet: This part is provided by the ISP (Internet Service Provider). The public network IP address is 45.67.89.10, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the gateway is 45.67.89.1. 3. Router: The router has two ports, the WAN port is connected to the Internet service provider, and the LAN port is connected to Switch1. The IP address of the WAN port is 45.67.89.1, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the gateway is empty. The IP address of the LAN port is 192.168.1.1, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the gateway is empty. This router needs to have NAT enabled so that the internal network can access the internet. 4. Switch1: Connect the LAN port of Router to the Trunk port of Switch2. The trunk port mode needs to be set to 802.1q, and the VLAN IDs are 10 and 20. The switch needs to have STP turned on. 5. Switch2: The switch connects the Trunk port of Switch1 and the Access ports of Server, Printer and NAS. The Access port mode needs to be set to Access, and the VLAN IDs are 10, 20, and 30 respectively. The IP addresses of these ports are 192.168.10.1, 192.168.20.1, and 192.168.30.1, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the gateway is 192.168.10.1. 6. Server: The server has two network cards, one is connected to the Access port of Switch2 whose VLAN is 20, and the other is connected to the Access port of Switch2 whose VLAN is 10. You need to configure dual-NIC binding. The IP addresses are 192.168.10.10 and 192.168.20.10 respectively, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the gateway is 192.168.10.1. 7. Printer: Connect to the Access port of Switch2 whose VLAN is 10, the IP address is 192.168.10.20, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the gateway is 192.168.10.1. 8. NAS: Connect the Access port of Switch2 with VLAN 30, the IP address is 192.168.30.10, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, and the gateway is 192.168.30.1. Configuration of these devices can be done using the CLI (command line interface) or the web interface. To ensure that all devices can communicate with each other, corresponding port configurations, VLAN configurations, and configurations between routers and switches are required. It is important to note that the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway of the device need to be configured correctly so that the device can properly route internal and external data traffic.
