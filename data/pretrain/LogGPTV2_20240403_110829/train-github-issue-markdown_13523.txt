 **TypeScript Version:**
1.8.2
**Background** :
I have been working on trying to get https://github.com/eslint/typescript-
eslint-parser, a TypeScript parser plugin for ESLint, off the ground, and the
job this weekend has been to begin adding JSX support.
ESLint uses espree and so the aim of the project is to convert the output of
the tsc to an AST which espree expects. We already have a solid suite of JSX
tests to develop against (taken from the espree project itself), but I have
come up against a tsc error in one of them so far.
My issue is that it seems currently the tsc does not accept this "embedded-
tags" JSX syntax:
**Code**
     right=monkeys /> gorillas />;
**Expected behavior:**  
Please note the AST produced by espree (see in particular the `tokens` array):

**Actual behavior:**  
...compared to the one produced by the tsc (note the issues found in
`parseDiagnostics`):
