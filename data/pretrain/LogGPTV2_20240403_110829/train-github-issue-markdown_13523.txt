**TypeScript Version:**
1.8.2

**Background:**
I have been working on integrating the TypeScript parser plugin for ESLint, [typescript-eslint-parser](https://github.com/eslint/typescript-eslint-parser), and my current task is to add support for JSX. 

ESLint primarily uses `espree` as its default parser, so the objective of this project is to convert the output of the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that `espree` can understand. We already have a comprehensive suite of JSX tests (adapted from the `espree` project) to work with, but I encountered an error in one of these tests.

**Issue:**
The problem I am facing is that `tsc` does not currently accept the "embedded-tags" JSX syntax. Here's the code snippet causing the issue:

```jsx
<right=monkeys /> gorillas />;
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The AST generated by `espree` should look like the following (please refer to the `tokens` array for more details):

**Actual Behavior:**
However, the AST produced by `tsc` differs and includes errors (refer to the `parseDiagnostics` section):
- [AST Explorer Link](http://astexplorer.net/#/YehKzLJYMW)

**Summary:**
To resolve this, we need to ensure that the `tsc` output matches the expected AST structure produced by `espree`, particularly for the "embedded-tags" JSX syntax.
