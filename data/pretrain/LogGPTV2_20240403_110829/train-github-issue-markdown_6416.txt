This seems to be a very inconsistant issue, but I think it's related to
macros.
Here's an example of a list of comments that don't get parsed properly:
    bitflags! {
        flags Tests: Test {
            /// Test
            static TestA = 0x80,
            // TODO: Document this.
            static TestB          = 0x40
        }
    }
This code will error saying "no rules expected the token `/// Test`".
