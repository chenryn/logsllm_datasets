User: You are conducting an application security assessment, what perspectives do you need to assess? Please provide an assessment framework.
Assistant: An application security assessment should be evaluated from the following perspectives: 1. Risk assessment: assess possible threats and security vulnerabilities, and the potential threats these vulnerabilities pose to the system. 2. Evaluation of verification measures: Check security defense measures and countermeasures, including access control, authentication and authorization, encryption, vulnerability management, etc. 3. Application Vulnerability Assessment: Conduct source code audits, manual/automated penetration tests, application security scans, etc. to assess application vulnerability. 4. Data security assessment: assess the application's ability to process data and sensitive information, including management of confidential information, security and integrity of data access and transmission, etc. 5. Response capacity and continuous assessment: assess the capacity and measures to deal with security threats, including emergency plans, security audits and measures to enhance security. The following is a framework for application security assessment: 1. Risk assessment - collect application-related information, analyze threats and vulnerabilities, and determine the surrounding conditions of key assets and threat parties. - Identify security threat conditions: Analyze attacker incentives, capabilities, goals, and threat types. - Prepare a risk assessment report, prioritizing according to the actual threat level that may occur. 2. Validation measures evaluation - trace analysis: review logs on the application for dishonest behavior; - access control: access control policies, user management and identity authentication; - network and protocol configuration; - comprehensive logging and auditing. 3. Application Vulnerability Assessment - Source Code Audit; - Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Management Scanning; - Manual Penetration Testing; - Web Application Testing, including SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks, etc. 4. Data security assessment - data storage security assessment; - data transmission assessment; - sensitive information assessment. 5. Responsiveness and Continuity Assessment - Contingency Plan; - Manual and Automated Assessment; - Security Audit Program; - Program to Enhance System Security.
