I've seen several questions regarding deleting images but none of them are
good for me.
Let's have a use case like this:
  * user adds an entity to a list ("favorites")
  * we load all the images for the entity and store them via Glide cache
  * now user can have the images even in offline mode
  * user removes entity from the list
Now what? I dont want to clear the cache completely (I want to keep all the
images of the other favorites) but I don't want to keep images in cache I dont
need (seems to pile up).
Havent checked the internal implementation but what stops from Glide to find
and delete an image of a particular URL if you're hashing it anyway? In our
case the URL's rarely if ever change too. I'm very happy with Glide but this
seems to be an issue which doesnt sound hard to fix.
Any future plans to do something like this?
Thanks
