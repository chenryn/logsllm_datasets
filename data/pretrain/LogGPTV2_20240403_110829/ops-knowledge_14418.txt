User: How to check the current memory usage in Linux system? And how to optimize memory usage?
Assistant: To view the current memory usage of the Linux system, you can use the following commands: 1. free command: Display memory usage or swap usage. ``` $ free -h ``` 2. top command: View process memory usage, you can sort by 'M'. ``` $ top ``` In order to optimize memory usage, you can take the following measures: 1. Disable unnecessary services or processes Stop unused services or processes, which will reduce the use of system resources. There are likely to be some pre-installed services in the Linux system, and you can consider disabling or uninstalling those that are not needed. 2. Adjust the size of the swap space If the system memory is insufficient, you can adjust the size of the swap space to provide additional virtual memory. It is not recommended to set a small swap space. 3. Swapping buffers and caches to disk You can flush buffers and caches to disk by running the sync command, thereby freeing up memory. Running the following command will flush the cache and buffers to disk: ``` $ sudo sync ``` 4. You can restart some processes that use a lot of memory. Free up system memory by restarting or stopping some large processes. 5. Reduce the memory usage of the process Minimize the memory usage as much as possible when writing or using the application. 6. Updating the kernel with a newer kernel may optimize system memory usage.
