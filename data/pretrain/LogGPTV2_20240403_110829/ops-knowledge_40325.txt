User: Right now, I'm learning Python and Javascript, and someone recently suggested to me that I learn tcl. Being a relative noob to programming, I have no idea what tcl is, and if it is similar to Python. As i love python, I'm wondering how similar the two are so I can see if I want to start it.
Assistant: While this question will obviously be closed as inconstructive in a short time, I'll leave my answer here anyway.
Joe, you appear to be greatly confused about what should drive a person who count himself a programmer to learn another programming language: in fact, one should have a natural desire to learn different languages because only this can widen one's idea about how problems can be solved by programming (programming is about solving problems).  Knowing N similar programming languages basically gives you nothing besides an immediate ability to use those programming languages. This doesn't add anything to your mental toolbox.
I suggest you to at least look at functional languages (everyone's excited about them these days anyway), say, Haskell. Also maybe look at LISP or a similar thing.
Tcl is also quite interesting in its concepts (almost no syntax, everything is a string, uniformity of commands etc). Python is pretty boring in this respect--it's certainly enables a programmer to do certain things quick and efficient but it does not contain anything to satisfy a prying mind.
So my opinion is that your premises are wrong. Hope I was able to explain why.
