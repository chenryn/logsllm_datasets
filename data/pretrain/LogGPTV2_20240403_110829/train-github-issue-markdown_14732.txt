When using Keras for regression problems, the mean squared error (MSE) is typically chosen as the loss function. However, you may observe a discrepancy between the loss value reported by the model in the final epoch of training and the loss calculated from the input data after the model has been saved and reloaded.

This inconsistency can arise due to several factors, such as differences in the batch size used during training and evaluation, numerical precision issues, or changes in the data preprocessing steps. To ensure consistency, it's important to use the same conditions for both training and evaluation, including the same batch size and any data preprocessing steps. Additionally, verifying that the model is being saved and loaded correctly can help mitigate this issue.
