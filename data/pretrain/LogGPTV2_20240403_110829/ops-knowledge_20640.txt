User: I'm writing a program in Python, the data I want it to show must be able to fit on the screen at the same time without needing to scroll around. The default command line size does not allow for this.
Is there any way to automatically resize a command line window in Python without creating a GUI? The program will only be used on windows.
Assistant: Change the console size by right-clicking on console titlebar -> Properties -> Layout -> Window size
