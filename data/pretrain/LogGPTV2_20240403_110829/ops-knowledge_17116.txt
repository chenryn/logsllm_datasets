User: I have installed Python 3.2 in my Mac. After I run /Applications/Python 3.2/Update Shell Profile.command, it's confusing that when I type Python -V in Terminal it says that Python 2.6.1.
How can I change the default Python version?
Assistant: It should be noted that recent versions of Homebrew/MacOS will require a different entry for the PATH as the location where Homebrew installs Python has changed. Add this like to your .zshrc:

export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"

This will ensure that the appropriate unversioned python link installed by Homebrew appears before that of version 2.x and will protect you from being impacted by any version updates to python as brew will update the unversioned links whenever it updates the version.
