### Details
For now on, Dubbo does not support to resolve all placeholders from property
value from any `PropertySource`, thus it will impact Dubbo Spring Boot's
externalization configuration, like this issue :
  * Can provider boot features external config placeholders in properties?
What's more, Dubbo's `PropertySourcesUtils` will be removed and replaced by
Alibaba's spring-context-support's `PropertySourcesUtils`
