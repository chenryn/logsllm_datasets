### Optimized Text

We employ TCP-ACK and UDP probes, in that order, to maximize our potential for inferring point-to-point (pt2pt) links. This sequence is chosen based on previous cross-validation efforts, which demonstrated that this order yields the most accurate inferences [13]. Our pt2pt inferences are robust, as they are supported by prior validation of IPID-based alias inferences by other researchers [19, 5, 10].

For our study, we selected eight operational CAIDA Archipelago (Ark) vantage points (VPs) on September 2, 2013, that provide a complete BGP view publicly. These VPs were chosen because they allow us to evaluate both traceroute-inferred and BGP-observed AS paths, providing insights into incongruities on pt2pt links. We invite the research community to further investigate these incongruities using these VPs.

From each VP, we randomly selected 10,000 destinations that quoted a probe's IP options in an ICMP destination unreachable message. These destinations were useful because they quote the IP options (step 1 in Figure 1). Each VP randomly selected a different set of destinations to probe. To increase the likelihood of selecting responsive destinations, we chose 2.5 million out of 14.5 million addresses from the ISI hitlist [1] with a score of at least 80 (where 99 represents an address that always responds to ISIâ€™s ICMP echo probes [8]). Despite selecting generally responsive destinations, only 15.1% to 18.8% (depending on the VP) responded and echoed the pre-specified timestamp option. This means we had to try between 53,000 and 66,000 addresses to obtain 10,000 useful destinations. Of the non-responsive destinations, 3.5% to 5.9% did not quote the timestamp option, while 94.1% to 96.5% did not respond at all. When we probed the same destinations without the timestamp option, 36.4% to 36.8% responded, indicating that including a timestamp option in a UDP probe reduced the fraction of responsive destinations by at least half.

In total, we obtained 80,004 traces containing 150,188 IP addresses, inferring 197,335 IP-level links between 7,401 ASes. Many IP interfaces were observed from multiple VPs; 28.0% of interfaces (IP addresses) were observed from at least two VPs, even though we used only eight VPs. We received responses to ICMP B|BBBB probes from 119,594 interfaces. For the 30,594 (25.6%) interfaces that received responses to ICMP B|BBBB probes from more than one VP, all VPs observed the same timestamp behavior, except for 538 interfaces (1.8%). Among these, 324 (60.2%) were in one AS, suggesting that routers in our data behaved consistently regardless of the probing location for ICMP B|BBBB probes. For each VP, the technique from [14] classified between 42.5% and 47.3% of interfaces in our data as appearing as on-path or off-path because they responded with 1-3 timestamps when probed with ICMP B|BBBB packets. In total, 77,348 of the 150,188 (51.5%) interfaces embedded 1-3 timestamps when probed with ICMP B|BBBB probes.

**Figure 2: IPID Differences Between Inferred Aliases A and A'**

The smaller the difference, the more reliable the alias inference. In our pairwise measurements, we rejected 4,837 initial pt2pt link inferences because either the IPIDs did not monotonically increase or the counters increased too fast to reliably infer aliases. Of the 81,000 remaining links, 33% of the IPID values were strictly incremented between alias pairs.

We resolved the IP-level links to AS-level links using the longest matching prefix observed by peers at RouteViews. 31,000 (15.8%) have addresses that map to two different ASes (inter-AS links), 153,000 (77.8%) have addresses that map to a single AS (internal to an AS), and 13,000 (6.4%) have addresses that are either not announced publicly or whose longest matching prefix is originated by multiple ASes. In total, we inferred 10,175 AS-level links from these traces. Of the 197,335 IP-level links, we inferred a /30 or /31 link for 86,152 links with an initial prefix scan. Our follow-up pairwise measurements discarded 5,000 links because the returned IPID sequence did not meet our requirements, leaving us with 81,315 pt2pt links. Figure 2 shows the IPID differences where aliases were inferred between A and A'. The solid line corresponds to the initial prefix scan that inferred a /30 or /31 mate A'; we plotted the maximum IPID difference between any two samples in the sequence of five probes. 50% of the samples had a maximum difference of 75. The dashed line corresponds to the subsequent pairwise measurements; for each inferred alias, we plotted the minimum IPID difference between responses from the same probed address. 50% of the samples had a minimum difference of 42, and 33.2% had a minimum difference of 2, indicating that the IPID of the alias fell immediately between a monotonic sequence. Therefore, we believe most of our pt2pt inferences are robust.

### 3. Results

In this section, we focus on addresses in traceroute paths that we inferred to be the address of the in-bound interface on a router and visited across a pt2pt link (i.e., were on-path). Of the 197,335 IP-level links, we inferred 81,315 (41.2%) to be pt2pt. Figure 3 plots the distribution of the fraction of in-bound interfaces in traceroutes observed by each VP. In our data, we inferred that more than half of the interfaces in paths represent the in-bound interface for at least half of their traceroutes.

**Figure 3: Distribution of the Fraction of In-Bound Interfaces Observed by Each VP**

For 7 of the 8 VPs, more than half of the interfaces in paths represent the in-bound interface for at least half of their traceroutes.

Between 70.9% and 74.6% of interfaces do not insert a timestamp despite being on-path. Between 1.0% and 1.5% of interfaces behaved differently depending on the destination probed (mixed column).
