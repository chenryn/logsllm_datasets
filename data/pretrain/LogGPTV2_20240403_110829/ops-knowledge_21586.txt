Question: "When a user attempts to use their fingerprint to unlock their Android device, which of the following sequences correctly describes the operational flow?"
 "A": "The user touches the fingerprint sensor, the device wakes, `FingerprintService` processes the matching result, and then the vendor-specific library determines if there's a match."
 "B": "The `authenticate` call is made, the fingerprint sensor activates, the user places a finger, and the vendor-specific library checks for a match against enrolled fingerprints."
 "C": "The device wakes the screen, `FingerprintService` calls the `authenticate` function, and then the user places their finger on the sensor for matching."
 "D": "The fingerprint sensor wakes the device, the user places their finger on the sensor, and `FingerprintService` immediately verifies the fingerprint without consulting the vendor-specific library."
Answer: B
