Hello all
This morning I downloaded numba as well as updated all packages with conda
update --all. I get an error when trying to import numpy. The message in the
ipython console prompted me to post on Github. The exact error message is:
Original error was: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
Some notes about my Anaconda/spyder environment
  * Both python and numpy were updated with the updates this morning
  * I am working on windows 10
  * I have had other python interpreters for awhile now. The other one is used in an ubuntu on windows virtual machine. But I did check to make sure the path to site-packages was correct in spyder.
I have seen similar posts from 2 days ago but I couldn't find any solutions
that worked for me.
Thanks in advance
