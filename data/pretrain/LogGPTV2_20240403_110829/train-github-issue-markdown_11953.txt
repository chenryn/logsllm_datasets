Subject: Issue Importing Numpy After Updating Packages with Conda

Hello All,

This morning, I installed the `numba` package and updated all of my packages using `conda update --all`. However, I encountered an error when attempting to import `numpy` in my IPython console. The specific error message is as follows:

```
Original error was: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
```

Here are some details about my Anaconda/Spyder environment:
- Both Python and NumPy were updated this morning.
- I am working on Windows 10.
- I have another Python interpreter set up in an Ubuntu on Windows virtual machine, but I verified that the path to `site-packages` in Spyder is correct.

I have come across similar issues reported within the last two days, but none of the solutions provided have resolved my problem.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Joel
