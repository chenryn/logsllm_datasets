i.e. the candidates for being replaced with DRs. For example, for AS
4134, we need only 179 heavy-hitter routers (including both edge
and core routers) to capture over 90% of the paths, but 749 edge
routers to intercept 100% paths, while for AS209 (Quest Communi-
cations), we choose the edge router set – about 1662 routers. We
present our results in Table 3.
As mentioned previously, several of these ASes are hosted in
censorious regimes, and so we identified the number of routers
to be replaced with DRs in non-censorious countries. While the
results presented in table 3 represents the number of routers to
be replaced for ASes presented in Table 1, Table 4 represent the
number of routers for ASes in non-censorious nations presented in
Table 2.
The total number of routers that may be replaced across ASes in
non-censorious ASes is 11, 709.
The 11, 709 key routers, across 30 key ASes that together in-
tercept greater than 90% of network paths, together represent a
formidable infrastructure, with equipment costs of 10.3 billion dol-
lars. Converting these routers to DRs would involve massive system
implementation, testing, deployment and related costs.
Implementation Details: Our AS-level map uses BGP Routing
Information Base (RIB) data, which we obtain from 15 Internet
Exchange points through routeviews [27], and AS relationship data
from CAIDA [14]. The map was constructed using virtual machines
with a total of 10 CPU cores (x64) and 24 GB RAM, running Ubuntu
Linux (14.04LTS server). Our multi-threaded implementation of
Gao’s [13] algorithm took ≈ 3-4 hrs. to compute paths to 10 prefixes.
To identify key routers in an AS, we ran traceroute probes
from 390 planetlab machines to three random IP’s in each prefix

6 DATA ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
Our method for placement of DRs, as presented in this paper, has
several major advantages:
(1) The placement of DRs is global, and needs to be run only
once to provide a small list of ASes that cover paths from
all adversaries. (Existing approaches [1] require fresh can-
didate ASes to place DRs for each adversary nation.)
(2) The ASes selected are located far away from the adversary
nations, and thus outside their geo-political and economic
sphere of control. This makes it more difficult to bring
pressure to bear on them.
(3) The selected ASes lie on a very large fraction of paths.
It is therefore hard for RAD adversaries [11] to bypass
them without risking disconnection from all or most of the
Internet. (This might inadvertently also disconnect foreign
customers, as we see in sub-section 6.2 .)
One may ask why we only consider paths to the 100 most popular
websites - what about paths to other IP prefixes? In this section,
we explore such concerns, focusing on questions such as:
paths to other unrelated sites (e.g. less popular ones) ?
• Do our key ASes also intercept an equally large fraction of
• A particular set of users may consider completely different
sites “popular” (for e.g., users in some countries may only
be interested in sites available in their language). Do our
key ASes effectively cover paths to such sites?
• How important are the key ASes to actual censorious na-
tions? If such nations chose to filter paths traversing these
key ASes, how would it impact their downstream (foreign)
customers?
Finally, we discuss the limitations of our method, and our plans
for future work.
6.1 How general are our results?
Our data shows that a small fraction of ASes (≈ 30) cumulatively
intercept over 90% of the total paths to popular web destinations
(Alexa top 10, 20 ... 200)12. The question naturally follows whether
these ASes are specific to the websites chosen for our study, or they
intercept a similarly large fraction of all traffic on the Internet.
From Rexford’s study of Internet structure [28], it is reasonable
to deduce that there is indeed a small set of ASes - core ASes of the
Internet - that cover a majority of routes of the Internet in general.
So our task becomes, gathering evidence to show that our 30 key
ASes intercept a large fraction of paths leading to various other
destinations also.
To begin with, we estimated AS paths to Set B, the set of sites
globally ranked 101–200 by Alexa. As Figure 6 shows, the 30 key
ASes identified using paths to Set A, intercepted over 90% of the
paths to Set B as well. The same pattern also holds for Set C - sites
popular in censorious countries - discussed in the next sub-section.
Figure 6: CDF of ASes according to fraction of paths they
intercept (for Alexa top-101 to 200 websites).
Finally, we repeated the entire experiment after a gap of four
months. We again found the same 30 ASes intercepting over 90%
of the paths (see Figure 14 in Appendix).
6.2 How important are the key ASes to actual
adversarial nations?
In order to answer this question, we began by measuring how
well key ASes cover paths from individual adversary nations to
globally important destinations. Our results, showing the fraction
of paths disconnected across 11 censorious nations, are presented in
Figure 7. The horizontal axis has country names (as 2-letter initials);
the vertical axis, the fraction of the paths covered by our key ASes.
We see that, for example, our 30 key ASes cover 98.8% of paths
from Chinese ASes to globally popular destinations, and at least
80% for nearly all adversary countries.
Figure 7: Eleven Censorious Nations: fractions of paths (to
major websites) dependent on our 30 key ASes.
12There is a third small caveat: Key ASes cover only more than 90%, and not 100% of
the paths. But from Houmansadr [1], we know that it is not feasible for a country to
launch a RAD attack and avoid 90% of paths. The only practical significance is that
a user may not get a DR on their first attempt; but if a user probes for a DR, with
greater than 99.9% probability she will succeed in three attempts (compared to the 30
attempts needed for earlier designs [6]), so this is not a major concern.
However, while these figures are encouraging, they are not
enough. For some nations (e.g. Iran, China), it might be argued that
the loss of paths to globally important sites simply does not matter,
as they have their own homegrown substitutes (e.g. facenama.com
and renren.com respectively for facebook.com).
In response to this concern, we investigated the popular web
destinations in censorious countries. As per Alexa [41], we find
that these include not only local websites, but also several of the
top-100 globally popular sites (search engines, social-media sites,
cloud services, e-commerce sites etc.). In other words, while the
choice of websites does vary across nations (e.g. based on user’s
choice of language), web access is not as “insular” as one may fear.
For each of nine adversary countries studied by Verkamp [42] -
China, Venezuela, Russia, Syria, Bahrain, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and Iran - we identified our Set C, consisting of the top 50
websites popular in each of these countries (and hosted outside
their respective networks). Shown in Figure 8, our 30 key ASes
intercept 93.3% of the paths originating or transiting these countries
and leading to the sites in Set C.
Figure 8: CDF of ASes according to fraction of paths inter-
cepted (for websites popular in censorious nations).
In considering that different paths originate in and transit through
a country, we further realized that avoiding key ASes might be
expensive for a country in more ways than one – collateral damage.
Collateral damage: Collateral damage results when an AS filters
sites, and also causes its customers to lose access [43]. If, for exam-
ple, China was to boycott the paths routed through our chosen key
ASes, Chinese people would lose access to much of the Internet
(and certainly to most popular websites); but so would customers
of Chinese ASes. It becomes a valid question to ask, how many
customers are affected?
To answer this question, we inspected the paths through and
from nine censorious countries. Figure 9 shows the percentage of
paths transiting censorious nations that originate at foreign ASes.
We see that in the case of China, for example, filtering traffic
through key ASes would affect a very large number of customers,
over whom Chinese censorship policies have no control. 306, 874
AS paths, out of a total of 332, 742 paths involving Chinese ASes
and leading to popular destinations - i.e. 92.25% - originate at ASes
outside China13. In fact, our data suggests that collateral damage to
customers might be a way to put pressure on several censorious
countries; we will explore this in future.
13362 particularly interesting paths originated at a Chinese AS, passed through non-
Chinese ASes, then re-entered China and passed through Chinese ASes, before finally
leaving for their destination.

censorious nations that originate at foreign ASes.
6.3 Might a different solution do better?
The macroscopic analysis (of AS level topology) gives an impression
that DR infrastructure is feasible, but the “devil in the details” is that
the microscopic view (at router level) shows that we would need to
convert thousands of routers into DRs. It is natural to ask whether
this conclusion is just an artifact of our method, and whether an
alternative approach might find a cheaper solution.
Our approach is not provably optimal. Indeed, we could get by
with a smaller number of routers if we placed the DRs to intercept all
traffic at a few, fixed overt destinations (e.g. Google). However, such
a solution is fragile: the censor could simply filter traffic to these
overt destinations. Our method of placing DRs uses far fewer ASes
than any known comparable methods [1], and intercepts traffic
to potential overt destinations (sites that are popular globally and
also in censorious nations – for whom it matters most). Seeing
how placing DRs in even our modest number of ASes is a major
undertaking, we conclude that there is no “silver bullet” – robust
DR deployment is feasible, but implementing it is a serious challenge.
6.4 Is it easier to cover single countries?
Our solution involves a single set of ASes that can serve as a DR
framework for the overwhelming majority of traffic globally. We
show that a global DR infrastructure is complex and likely expen-
sive; but might it be feasible to target single censor countries?
We find that in case of major adversaries like China, the best
solution is to use the same 30 ASes that we would use for a world-
wide DR system. In case of some minor countries such as Syria
(which has 2 ASes), Sorted Ring placement [1] does allow a simpler
solution: we identified 3 ASes which intercept all Syrian AS level
paths. But the router level maps of these ASes suggest that, even
for Syria, we need 1, 117 DRs in 3 different ASes.
Our conclusion is that targeting a DR infrastructure to single
countries is difficult even against relatively weak adversaries, and
the best solution against strong adversaries (our solution in this
paper) is more expensive still.
6.5 How economically feasible is Decoy
Routing?
Our results show that a comprehensive DR infrastructure would
span about 30 ASes across ten countries, and require massive incen-
tives. The question immediately arises whether existing business
models for Decoy Routing [12], i.e. central deployment (where a sin-
gle organization pays individual AS operators to deploy DRs) and
autonomous deployment (where ASes individually deploy DRs and
bill their users for usage), can reasonably provide such incentives.
In the case of central deployment, we note that unlike, for in-
stance, Tor, this project will depend on large-scale corporate partic-
ipation. Tor is a globally distributed volunteer network, involving
participants running the open-source Tor software on their (per-
sonal) end-hosts; the actual funding for the project only needs to
support the developers, maintainers and some minimal infrastruc-
ture (Directory Authority servers, etc.) A worldwide DR framework
needs to incentivize multiple multi-billion dollar companies to co-
operate, and it is disturbingly likely that a single player who pays
such incentives - whether a major company or a government - is
motivated by its own agenda, rather than benevolence.
Autonomous deployment suffers from an even more serious issue.
Decoy Routing obfuscates public knowledge of the deployment
infrastructure (physical location and hosting network); but such
obfuscation also makes it difficult for users to target payment. Any
Internet based payment scheme would reveal the identities of DR
hosting ASes to the clients, and in time, to their censorious ISPs.
The adversary now simply blocks such Internet based payment
transactions in order to prevent users from getting DR service;
the whole “robust infrastructure that cannot be routed around” is
rendered moot.
We therefore conclude that a practical DR infrastructure faces
substantial challenges, and would likely only be possible with major
support from one or more powerful nations.
6.6 Methods, Limitations, and Future Work.
This sub-section is devoted to the choices we made, w.r.t. the design
of our methods of network mapping. We explain our choices, their
limitations, and how we propose to go forward in future.
Choice of AS: The first major question in our study, was how
to choose key ASes. It may be argued that we could simply have
chosen Tier-1 ASes – i.e. ASes that have no provider – or ASes
with the largest customer cone size (The customers, customers of
customers, etc. of an AS are said to form its “customer cone”.), based
on publicly available data [14], as proposed earlier [1]. Why pick
key ASes by path frequency? It turns out that there is indeed a good
reason for directly choosing ASes by path frequency, i.e. by how
many of the paths they intercept.
A substantial fraction of AS paths traverse the customers of “root”
ASes(i.e., those with very large customer cones) without traversing
the root ASes themselves. For e.g., the traffic through AS9002 to
AS2818 (www.bbc.co.uk) does not pass through AS3356, though it
is the provider to both these ASes (see Figure 10).
Unsurprisingly, 34.16% of the paths to top-100 IP-prefixes tra-
verse the AS with the largest customer cone, AS3356 (cone size
= 24, 553). But nearly as many paths, 33.17%, pass through its 1-
hop (immediate) customers, and not AS3356. In the Appendix, we

present more such figures (Table 5), and show that Spearman’s Rank
Correlation coefficient [44] between AS ranks by path frequency
and by cone size is only 0.2. Given the considerable fraction of paths
which do not transit root ASes with large cone sizes (preferring
to transit through their customer ASes instead), we conclude that
customer-cone size is not a good parameter to choose key ASes.
AS path estimation: The two main methods of estimating an inter-
AS topology are: (a) using traceroute traces (as in CAIDA Ark)
(b) using BGP routing tables. Traceroute data, being constrained by
the location of available probing nodes, is not sufficiently rich to
estimate the actual path of traffic from every AS to a given prefix.
Hence we choose the routing-table approach.
Previous efforts use simulated BGP paths [1], or paths derived
from a Breadth-First traversal of inter-AS links [28]. We improve
upon this by employing Gao’s algorithm with real BGP tables (col-
lected from various Internet Exchanges [27]), thereby estimating
the actual paths from a chosen IP prefix to all ASes (at a given point
of time).
Of course, our map is still not perfect. As Gregori et al. [45, 46]
