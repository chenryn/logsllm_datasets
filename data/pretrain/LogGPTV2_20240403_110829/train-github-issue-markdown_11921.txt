I absolute LOVE atom, but this is the one and only big complaint I have.
My project compiles files to "public/" folder. This folder is not git-ignored,
so therefore it shows up when I search my project for anything. This is very
annoying as I never need to see results from this folder.
Would be perfect if I could exclude file types/folders. Specially if it was
working with "Projects settings".
Thanks guys, you rock!
