**ATT&CK ID:** M1041  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Encrypt Sensitive Information

Encrypting sensitive information adds an additional layer of security when transmitting data via email. This method, which often employs public key cryptography, ensures that even if the message is intercepted, it remains unreadable to unauthorized parties. For an adversary to decrypt the message, they would need to obtain both the private key and the corresponding encryption key, making unauthorized access significantly more difficult.
