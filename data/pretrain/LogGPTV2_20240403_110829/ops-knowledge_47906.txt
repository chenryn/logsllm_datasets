**Subject: Launching a Python Child Process as the SYSTEM Account in Windows**

Hello,

I am currently developing a test application in Python. For a specific testing scenario, I need to launch my Python child process under the Windows SYSTEM account.

One approach I considered is to create an executable (EXE) from my Python script and then use that to create a Windows service. However, this solution is not ideal for me because it would require regenerating the EXE every time I make changes to my Python script.

If anyone has a better or more efficient method to achieve this, I would greatly appreciate your suggestions.

Thank you,
Bishnu

**Response:**

Hi Bishnu,

Another option you might consider is using the Windows Task Scheduler. It can run a script under the SYSTEM account, and its interface is relatively user-friendly, especially if you do not need to frequently modify and retest the script.

Best regards,
