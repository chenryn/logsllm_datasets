**Title: BlackHat US-18: Identity Theft - Attacks on SSO Systems**

**Abstract:**

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) serves as the trust anchor for Single Sign-On (SSO) in many modern organizations. This presentation will explore a newly discovered vulnerability that has impacted multiple independent SAML implementations, and more broadly, can affect any system relying on the security of XML signatures. The vulnerabilities identified through this research have affected several libraries, which may underpin numerous SSO systems.

**Root Cause:**

The core issue stems from the way various SAML implementations traverse the XML Document Object Model (DOM) after validating signatures. This flaw allows an attacker to tamper with signed XML documents, altering attributes such as the authenticating user, without invalidating the signatures over these attributes. Consequently, an attacker with authenticated access to a SAML Identity Provider (IdP) can gain access to services as a different user, often more easily than one might anticipate.

**Additional Vulnerabilities:**

The talk will also address another class of vulnerabilities in user directories that amplify the impact of the aforementioned SAML vulnerability. In some cases, these directory vulnerabilities can enable authentication bypasses independently, further compromising the security of SSO systems.

By understanding these vulnerabilities, organizations can take proactive steps to mitigate risks and enhance the security of their SSO infrastructure.
