I have used `setTimeout` to implement the idle connection timeout for the
connection pool.  
But when user write some short-running app like this:
    const client = new Client().connect(/* ... */);
    console.log(await client.query("SELECT ..."));
    // End of file, but Deno won't exit
Deno won't exit after it finishes querying. It still waits for some timer (by
`setTimeout`) that can close pooled connection when it stayed idle for too
long.
I think there should be a timer API that won't prevent Deno from exiting
automatically.
