Assistant: 1. Create a branch: You can use the 'git branch [branch name]' command to create a branch, for example: 'git branch dev' can create a branch named 'dev'. 2. Switch branches: You can use the 'git checkout [branch name]' command to switch branches, for example: 'git checkout dev' can switch to the 'dev' branch. 3. Merge branches: You can use the 'git merge [branch name]' command to merge branches. Before merging branches, you must switch to the target branch to be merged, for example: 'git checkout dev', and then use the 'git merge master' command to merge Code from the 'master' branch is merged into the 'dev' branch. 4.
