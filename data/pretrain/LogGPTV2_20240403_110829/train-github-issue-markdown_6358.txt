### Description
When viewing the DAG history in Tree View, individual DAG run times are
available by hovering over the DAG run. As an Airflow user, I would like the
average execution time to be readily available in the UI -> DAG -> Tree View.  
It can be an average over the last _n_ runs, _n_ being the number of runs
selected in the Tree View.
### Use case/motivation
The average DAG run execution information can help our team make decisions
such as the optimal schedule interval for a DAG.
