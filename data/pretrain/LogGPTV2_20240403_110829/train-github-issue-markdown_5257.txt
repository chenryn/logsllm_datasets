**Current behavior**
We don't have an SPA. And we can't go full SPA right now. So there are
multiple root components placed in the DOM
    @NgModule({
        imports: [ BrowserModule ],
        providers: [ MyService ],
    })
    export class BaseModule {
      ngDoBootstrap(applicationRef: ApplicationRef) {
        const zone = applicationRef.zone;
        platform._injector = applicationRef.injector;
        zone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
          // run several modules in same zone and with same parent injector
          platform._bootstrapModuleWithZone(AppModule1, [], zone);
          platform._bootstrapModuleWithZone(AppModule2, [], zone);
        });
      }
    }
    const platform = platformBrowserDynamic();
    platform.bootstrapModule(BaseModule);
**Expected/desired behavior**
Have multiple root modules that share one base injector and zone. Don't have
to override private properties and call private methods. Maybe a
`applicationRef.bootstrapChildModule(AppModule1)` method.

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Not everyone that might want to switch to angular2 can go full single-page-
app.
