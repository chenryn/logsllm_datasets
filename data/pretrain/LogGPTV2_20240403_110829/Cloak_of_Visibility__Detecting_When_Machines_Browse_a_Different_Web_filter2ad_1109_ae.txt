measure accuracy based on the cluster’s separation of our la-
beled dataset. We present our results in Table IX. Unsupervised
learning achieves an overall accuracy 84.6% and false positive
rate of 9.7% compared to supervised learning which achieves
an accuracy of 95.5% with 0.9% false positives. While this
indicates there is substantial power in merely comparing the
similarity of content between multiple clients, a supervised
classiﬁer far outperforms clustering when labeling edge cases.
VII. CLOAKING IN THE WILD
Having vetted our classiﬁer, we apply it to an unlabeled
dataset of 135,577 search results and advertisements targeting
high-value, commonly abused keywords related to luxury
products, weight loss, and mobile gaming. We measure the
prevalence of cloaking in the wild and categorize the blackhat
techniques involved.
A. Frequency
In Table X, we show the incidence of cloaked content
for Google Search results and Google Ads. We estimate
4.9% of mobile-targeted advertisements predicated on high-
risk keywords direct to cloaked content. This demonstrates
that miscreants readily attempt to abuse the advertisement
ecosystem as a distribution channel for nutraceuticals and
knock-off mobile games and justiﬁes a heightened scrutiny for
speciﬁc ad targeting practices. We make no claim that Google
fails to detect
these cloaked URLs; only that miscreants
purposefully provide evasive content to Googlebot while URLs
remain operational.3 For search, we ﬁnd 11.7% of URLs in
the top 100 results direct to cloaked content. This is consistent
with previous estimates of pharmaceutical-based cloaking in
Google search results where Wang et al. estimated 9.4% of
search results linked to cloaked doorways [32]. Our results
illustrate that cloaking remains a common blackhat practice
requiring constant maintenance on the part of security crawlers
to keep pace with the arms race. That said, our measurements
show that miscreants more commonly target search results
over advertisements, likely due to the cost of advertising.
3We do not track whether URLs are eventually pulled, precluding any
longitudinal evaluation for how long it takes before ads are disabled.

B. Targeting Techniques
Cloaking sites hide their payload from everyone but the in-
tended audience of organic users. We analyze how miscreants
arrive at this distinction and study any differences between ad
and search-based cloaking. To do so, ﬁrst we mark all cloaking
URLs in the unlabeled dataset with our full classiﬁer. Then,
for each class of targeting techniques, such as checking that
the visitor has a HTTP Referer set, we train a classiﬁer on
our labeled dataset but speciﬁcally exclude browser proﬁles
that include the targeting technique under evaluation. We then
measure the fraction of cloaking URLs in the unlabeled dataset
that this new classiﬁer identiﬁes as cloaking, effectively acting
as a proxy for which targeting criteria is critical to receive de-
cloaked content (and thus accurate detection). Note that we
use the unlabeled dataset as our test set to mitigate any bias
in our labeled dataset.
We show the ﬁngerprinting checks miscreants use for
Google Search and Google Ads in Table XI. We ﬁnd the most
prominent targeting criteria is the presence of JavaScript which
miscreants use for 49.6% of cloaked ads and 22.4% of cloaked
search results. This is followed in popularity by checking for
Googlebot’s IP address and User-Agent, and ﬁnally evidence
that a client interacts with a page (e.g., clicking). Our results
highlight that any anti-cloaking pipeline must come outﬁtted
with each of these capabilities to accurately contend with
cloaking.

C. Delivery Techniques
Cloaking sites deliver their uncloaked content to organic
visitors in a variety of ways. Some sites opt to redirect visitors
to a monetized URL, either via a server-side decision (via
a 30X redirection), or on the client-side via JavaScript. To
be less conspicuous, other sites opt to display the uncloaked
content directly in the landing page, either through a reverse
proxy, or a modiﬁcation of the DOM such as adding div,
img, or iframe elements. We analyze the most popular
delivery techniques in our dataset as determined by our
network logs for sites labeled as cloaking, broken down by
type in Table XII. We ﬁnd delivery techniques in the wild
differ substantially between search results and advertisements.
