### Table X: Prevalence of Cloaking in Google Search and Ads for URLs Tied to High-Risk Keywords

| Source         | Keyword Category | % Cloaking |
|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Google Ads     | Health, software ads | 4.9%       |
| Google Search  | Luxury storefronts    | 11.7%      |

### Evaluation of Clustering vs. Supervised Learning

We evaluated the accuracy of our unsupervised clustering method using a labeled dataset. The results are presented in Table IX. Unsupervised learning achieved an overall accuracy of 84.6% with a false positive rate of 9.7%. In contrast, supervised learning achieved an accuracy of 95.5% with a false positive rate of 0.9%. This indicates that while comparing content similarity between multiple clients is effective, a supervised classifier significantly outperforms clustering, especially in handling edge cases.

### VII. Cloaking in the Wild

#### A. Frequency

After validating our classifier, we applied it to an unlabeled dataset of 135,577 search results and advertisements targeting high-value, commonly abused keywords related to luxury products, weight loss, and mobile gaming. We measured the prevalence of cloaking and categorized the blackhat techniques involved.

In Table X, we present the incidence of cloaked content for Google Search results and Google Ads. We estimate that 4.9% of mobile-targeted advertisements based on high-risk keywords direct to cloaked content. This suggests that malicious actors frequently attempt to abuse the advertisement ecosystem as a distribution channel for nutraceuticals and knock-off mobile games, justifying increased scrutiny of specific ad targeting practices. For search, 11.7% of URLs in the top 100 results direct to cloaked content, consistent with previous estimates of pharmaceutical-based cloaking in Google search results [32]. Our findings indicate that cloaking remains a common blackhat practice, necessitating continuous maintenance by security crawlers to keep up with the ongoing arms race. However, our measurements show that miscreants more commonly target search results over advertisements, likely due to the cost of advertising.

#### B. Targeting Techniques

Cloaking sites hide their payload from everyone except the intended audience of organic users. We analyzed how miscreants distinguish between these audiences and studied any differences between ad and search-based cloaking. To do this, we first marked all cloaking URLs in the unlabeled dataset using our full classifier. Then, for each class of targeting techniques, such as checking if the visitor has a HTTP Referer set, we trained a classifier on our labeled dataset but excluded browser profiles that include the targeting technique under evaluation. We then measured the fraction of cloaking URLs in the unlabeled dataset that this new classifier identified as cloaking, effectively acting as a proxy for which targeting criteria are critical for receiving decloaked content (and thus accurate detection). Note that we used the unlabeled dataset as our test set to mitigate any bias in our labeled dataset.

Table XI shows the fingerprinting checks miscreants use for Google Search and Google Ads. The most prominent targeting criteria is the presence of JavaScript, used for 49.6% of cloaked ads and 22.4% of cloaked search results. This is followed by checking for Googlebotâ€™s IP address and User-Agent, and finally, evidence that a client interacts with a page (e.g., clicking). Our results highlight that any anti-cloaking pipeline must be equipped with each of these capabilities to accurately contend with cloaking.

#### C. Delivery Techniques

Cloaking sites deliver their uncloaked content to organic visitors in various ways. Some sites opt to redirect visitors to a monetized URL, either via a server-side decision (via a 30X redirection) or on the client-side via JavaScript. To be less conspicuous, other sites display the uncloaked content directly in the landing page, either through a reverse proxy or a modification of the DOM, such as adding div, img, or iframe elements. We analyzed the most popular delivery techniques in our dataset as determined by our network logs for sites labeled as cloaking, broken down by type in Table XII. We found that delivery techniques in the wild differ substantially between search results and advertisements.

### Table XI: Fingerprinting Techniques Used to Make a Cloaking Decision

| Fingerprinting Check           | Google Search | Google Ads |
|--------------------------------|---------------|------------|
| Has referrer set?              | 5.4%          | 18.0%      |
| User has clicked?              | 20.7%         | 49.6%      |
| Is Google (IP, User Agent)?    | 8.5%          | 6.1%       |
| Has JavaScript support?        | 10.6%         | 22.4%      |
| Is mobile device?              | 14.3%         | 4.9%       |

### Table XII: Delivery Techniques in the Wild, Broken Down for Google Search and Ads

| Cloaking Type                  | Google Search | Google Ads |
|--------------------------------|---------------|------------|
| 30X Redirections               | 33.6%         | 19.9%      |
| 40X Client Errors              | 12.0%         | 8.5%       |
| 50X Server Errors              | 2.5%          | 4.4%       |
| JavaScript Redirections        | 29.9%         | 6.6%       |
| Same-page Modifications        | 22.0%         | 60.6%      |

These tables and analyses provide a comprehensive overview of the prevalence and techniques of cloaking in both Google Search and Google Ads, highlighting the need for robust and adaptive anti-cloaking measures.
