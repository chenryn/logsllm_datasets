User:  How to achieve load balancing of server resources? What are the commonly used load balancing algorithms?
Assistant: The load balancing of server resources generally adopts the following two methods: 1. Hardware load balancing: use special hardware load balancing devices, such as F5 Big-IP, Cisco ACE, etc. These devices distribute requests through hardware optimization algorithms, with high stability performance and performance. 2. Software load balancing: By installing load balancing software, requests are distributed to multiple servers to achieve balanced utilization of resources. Common software load balancing tools include Nginx, LVS, HAProxy, etc. Commonly used load balancing algorithms are as follows: 1. Round Robin: Assign requests to different servers in turn, and evenly distribute request traffic. 2. Least Connections algorithm (Least Connections): Assign requests to the server with the least number of connections, suitable for servers that perform time-consuming tasks. 3. IP Hash Algorithm (IP Hash): The IP address of the request is used as the keyword of the hash, and the hash result determines which server the request is allocated to, which is suitable for applications that need to maintain TCP/HTTP connections for a long time. 4. Weighted round robin algorithm (Weighted Round Robin): Assign weights to different servers, and the server with the higher weight will get more requests. 5. Weighted Least Connections algorithm (Weighted Least Connections): Assign the request to the server with the least number of connections, but also consider the influence of server weight. 6. Random algorithm (Random): Randomly select a server to process the request, which is suitable for application scenarios that do not require high load balancing performance.
