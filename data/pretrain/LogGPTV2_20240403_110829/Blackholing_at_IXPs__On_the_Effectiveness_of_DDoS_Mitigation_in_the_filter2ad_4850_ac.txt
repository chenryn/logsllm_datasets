### 1. Introduction
This document presents an analysis of blackholing as a DDoS mitigation technique at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). The study covers the effectiveness of blackholing, its usage patterns, and the impact on traffic volumes. Two case studies are provided to illustrate the practical application and outcomes of blackholing.

### 2. Case Study I: Traffic Volumes for Blackholed Prefixes
#### 2.1. Overview
Figure 5(b) illustrates the traffic volumes for blackholed prefixes over a three-month period. The AS in question (AS k) announced 415 prefixes for blackholing, all at the same time. The blackhole was active for approximately 10 minutes, as indicated by the dashed vertical line in the figure.

#### 2.2. Traffic Analysis
- **Pre-Blackhole**: For about 30 minutes before the blackhole announcement, the AS received regular traffic.
- **During Blackhole**: Upon the blackhole announcement, the traffic received by the AS dropped by a factor of approximately 100. The blackholed traffic (dotted lines) is smaller than the "missing" traffic due to various reasons, such as BGP router configurations and other corrective actions taken by the AS.
- **Post-Blackhole**: After the blackhole was deactivated, the traffic volume returned to a level close to the previous one, with a difference of about 300 Mbit/s.

#### 2.3. Observations
- The objective of the blackhole was achieved, as no further blackhole announcements were made for these prefixes.
- The reduction in traffic is not always equal to the amount of blackholed traffic, which can be attributed to:
  - BGP router configurations that may not accept more specific prefixes than /24.
  - Additional corrective actions by the AS, such as blackholing at upstreams, moving traffic from peering to transit, or activating DDoS traffic filtering services.
  - A significant fraction of TCP traffic being broken by the blackhole, leading to a drastic reduction in data traffic.

### 3. Case Study II: Traffic and Port Mix
#### 3.1. Overview
Figure 6(a) shows the traffic data for another AS over a six-day period starting from July 26, 2015. This case study involved substantial traffic, an interesting port mix, and a single IP (/32 prefix).

#### 3.2. Traffic Analysis
- **Traffic Spike**: Before the blackhole announcement, the traffic to the AS spiked from roughly 6 Gbit/s to 17.6 Gbit/s.
- **Blackhole Effectiveness**: The blackhole announcement for the /32 prefix was highly effective, as the regular traffic for the IP, /16, and the AS dropped significantly immediately after the announcement.
- **Traffic Patterns**: Over the next few days, the traffic to the IP gradually decreased, while the non-blackholed traffic to the /16 and /32 showed clear daily patterns.

#### 3.3. Port Distribution
- **Initial Distribution**: Initially, HTTP (port 80) accounted for about 30% of the traffic.
- **Blackhole Trigger**: With the blackhole trigger event, OpenVPN (port 1194) traffic drastically increased, constituting about 50% of all traffic to the AS.
- **Convergence**: As the blackhole took effect, the port mix slowly converged to the initial distribution, with OpenVPN traffic being dominant in the blackholed traffic (99.9% UDP, port 1194).

### 4. Related Work
While this work focuses on blackholing, other reactive DDoS defense mechanisms include:
- **Source-based Defense**: Deployed near the source of an attack, using techniques like IP source address filtering and heuristics on ingress/egress traffic flows.
- **Destination-based Defense**: Deployed near the victim-end, using adaptive rate limiting, network reconfiguration, and traceback.
- **Network-based Defense**: Deployed inside intermediate networks, incorporating distributed or trust-based detection and filtering mechanisms.

Despite the availability of various approaches, effective reactive techniques deployed in practice are rare. Blackholing, however, has shown to be a useful tool for DDoS mitigation at IXPs.

### 5. Summary and Future Work
- **Usage of Blackholing**: Blackholing is frequently used, with about 23,000 announced blackholes over a three-month period, and a considerable prefix size up to /18.
- **Effectiveness**: Blackholing successfully reduces the amount of traffic, as demonstrated in the case studies.
- **Future Directions**: There is room for increased efficacy, such as effective monitoring and reporting, partially retracting blackholing, and common operation practices at ASes.
