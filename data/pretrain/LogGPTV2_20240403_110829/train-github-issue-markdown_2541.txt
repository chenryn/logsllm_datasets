## Expected Behavior
`next build` does not include absolute path to node module
## Current Behavior
`next build` includes absolute path in transpiled require path
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
### Correct
    yarn add next@4.2.0
    next build
    # Transpiled output
    var _extends2 = require('babel-runtime/helpers/extends');
### Incorrect
    yarn add next@canary
    next build
    # Transpiled output
    var _extends2 = require('/Users/kyle/projects/test/node_modules/babel-runtime/helpers/extends');
## Context
Unable to deploy to lambda using up due to `up` building locally and uploading
zip file to s3 rendering absolute paths invalid
