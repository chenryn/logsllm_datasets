### Do Social Disorders Facilitate Social Engineering? A Case Study of Autism and Phishing Attacks

**ACSAC ’18, December 3–7, 2018, San Juan, PR, USA**

#### Abstract
This study examines the performance of individuals with autism in identifying phishing websites compared to those without autism. Contrary to the hypothesis that users with autism might be more susceptible to deception, our findings indicate that they are equally capable, if not more, in detecting phishing attacks. This paper discusses the methods, results, and implications of the study.

#### 1. Introduction
Previous psychological studies have suggested that individuals with autism may be more vulnerable to deception due to difficulties in decision-making and discerning others' intentions. However, this study explores whether these individuals are also more susceptible to phishing attacks.

#### 2. Methodology
- **Participants**: Fifteen participants with autism and fifteen without autism.
- **Procedure**: Participants were presented with 60 websites (both real and fake) and asked to identify them. They also completed post-test questionnaires about their strategies and experiences.

#### 3. Results
- **Identification Strategies**:
  - **Participants with Autism**:
    - 90% looked at the website logo, design, and URL.
    - 60% checked for security locks/certificates.
    - Many noticed obfuscated URLs, modified logs, and responded accordingly.
  - **Participants without Autism**:
    - 60% examined the website logo, design, security certificate, and URL.
    - 13% used additional techniques (e.g., hovering over links, checking browser tabs).
    - 26% only looked at the URL and/or security lock/certificate.

- **Overall Performance**:
  - Both groups demonstrated careful examination of the websites.
  - Participants with autism showed a higher accuracy in identifying phishing websites, despite having, on average, lower educational levels.

- **Qualitative Insights**:
  - Participants with autism reported that their condition did not hinder their computer skills.
  - Many spent significant time playing video games and expressed interest in web security and privacy.
  - Some young individuals with autism demonstrated advanced skills in breaking firewalls and accessing secure sites.

#### 4. Discussion
- **Phishing Detection Capabilities**:
  - Users with autism were equally, if not more, capable than those without autism in detecting phishing websites.
  - Their detail-oriented nature and methodological approach helped them notice minute differences and make correct decisions.

- **Potential in Cybersecurity**:
  - The inherent ability of users with autism to pick up tiny details, along with their strong problem-solving and pattern recognition skills, makes them suitable for cybersecurity roles.
  - These skills can be beneficial in tasks such as anomaly detection, malware detection, and identifying system vulnerabilities.

- **Future Directions**:
  - Further research is needed to understand the usability of security tools and parameters for specialized groups, including those with social and mental disorders.
  - Studies should also focus on password policies and their usability for different user groups, especially older adults.

#### 5. Study Strengths and Limitations
- **Strengths**:
  - Use of real working websites and standard URL obfuscation methods.
  - Recruitment of participants with and without autism for a between-group study.
  
- **Limitations**:
  - Limited number of trials and short time frame, which may not reflect real-world browsing behavior.
  - Explicit instructions to identify real and fake websites, which may differ from implicit real-world scenarios.
  - Small sample size, though representative of active computer users and phishing-prone populations.
  - Educational disparity between the two groups, with participants without autism being better educated.

#### 6. Concluding Remarks
This study highlights the potential of individuals with autism in cybersecurity, particularly in phishing detection. Despite their reported gullibility, their detail-oriented and methodological nature equips them well to combat phishing attacks. Future research should explore their capabilities in other security tasks and the usability of security tools for specialized user groups.
