some were not secure’.
We had also asked the participants about the strategy they
adopted to identify the real website. Among the participants
with autism, 90% of them reported that they had looked
at the website logo, look and feel of the website, and the
address of the website, and 60% of them reported that they
looked at the security lock/certificate. The users with autism
were careful enough to notice the obfuscated URLs, modified
logs, and provide response accordingly. On the other hand,
among the participants without autism, 60% of them said that
they looked at the website logo, look and feel of the website,
security certificate, and the address of the website, 13% of
them reported they used other techniques (e.g., looked at the
links by hovering in it, the logo on the tab and the browser) to

identify the fake websites, and 26% reported they only looked
at the URLs, and/or security lock/certificate. Overall, the
responses provided by both sets of participants reflect that
they were carefully examining the websites to identify their
legitimacy even though they were only partially successful in
it as demonstrated by our quantitative analysis (see Section
5).
• Other Interesting Comments: On asking the participants with
autism, if having autism was an obstacle to learn computer
skills, many of them said it was not a problem at all. Also,
they reported that they spend most of the time playing video
games on the computer, and are interested in web security
and privacy and also mentioned that some of the young in-
dividuals with autism are pretty good with breaking firewall
and getting through a website.
In summary, our post-test questionnaires reflect that the partici-
pants of our study, were pretty careful in identifying the websites
presented to them. The participants with autism, similar to the
participants without autism, had used their knowledge properly
and had identified the phishing websites correctly with the ac-
curacy better than random guessing. The responses provided by
the participants with autism demonstrates that they might not be
more vulnerable than the participants without autism in phishing
detection task.
7 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this section, we summarize and further discuss the main findings
of our study. We also outline the strengths and limitations of our
study.
Users with autism may be equally capable to healthy individ-
uals in detecting phishing websites: In this study, we analyzed
both the quantitative and qualitative data collected for the phishing
detection task with the with and without autism spectrum disor-
der. The prior psychology studies have reported that the users with
autism are susceptible to deception and find it difficult to make deci-
sions and discern the intentions of other people [16, 35]. In this light,
we had hypothesized that they may be more susceptible to phishing
attacks compared to the participants without autism. However, our
quantitative results demonstrates that the users with autism are no
less than healthy participants in identifying the phishing websites.
Even though the education level of our participants with autism
on average was lower than the participants without autism, there
was no statistically significant difference in the accuracy. Their
good performance in the phishing detection task was explained by
their answers to the qualitative questionnaires. Many participants
reported that they had noticed missing security locks/certificates,
obfuscated URLs, and distorted logos in some of the websites pre-
sented to them. The previous studies on the users with autism also
report them as the detail oriented and methodological people with
the capability to notice minute changes [2, 4]. Our study suggests
that the users with autism are capable of noticing the minute differ-
ences, analyzing them, and making correct decisions, which may
enable them to detect phishing attacks.
Users with autism may make for good cybersecurity profes-
sionals: The previous neuroscience studies have reported that the
brain of users with autism is inherently capable to pick up tiny
details [4]. A report prepared by The National Autistic Society
[2] states the users with autism have a methodological approach,
good memory for factual information, strong problem solving skills,
specialist knowledge and skills, and pattern recognition skills. We
believe these skills may have made them successful in identifying
the real vs. fake websites presented to them during the study. These
skills might also be helpful in other security tasks, e.g., anomaly
detection, malware detection and unusual behavior of the computer
systems. The detail–oriented nature of the users with autism may
help identify attacks, loopholes in defense mechanisms, and bugs
in the secure codes. Given this, it is not surprising that there are
several openings in cybersecurity calling for users with autism to
apply [8]. However, more focused studies are needed to further
understand the capability of users with autism in cybersecurity.
Nevertheless, our study highlights the positive aspects of users
with autism and show that such users may make them skilled at
cybersecurity, at least in the field of detection of phishing scams.
Potential future directions: Recently, researchers have been con-
ducting studies to understand the usability of security tools and
parameters to specific set of population e.g., journalists and lawyers
[19, 24]. The universally acceptable usable privacy and security is
challenging, and hence the studies to analyze the performance
of users in different groups of population is important. The fu-
ture study could be conducted to analyze how usable CAPTCHAs,
phishing toolbars, and verification images are with respect to such
specialized groups of users, including those suffering from social
and mental disorders. Also, the password policies are being stronger
lately with the users required to mix up their password with dif-
ferent symbols, alphabets and digits. Such passwords may not be
usable for aged users as it might be difficult for them to remember
the complex stuffs. There is need for password security research
focused on special samples of users.
8 STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS
Our study has several strengths. First, we set-up our study with real
working websites, unlike images used in previous studies [13, 26].
We also followed standard URL obfuscation methodology, URL
shortening methodology, and use of IP address to design our fake
URLs. To make them the URLs realistic, we borrowed real-world
fake URLs from www.phishtank.org. We recruited participants with
and without autism and conducted a ’between-group’ study to
analyze the performance of users with autism.
Similar to prior lab-based studies, we also had some limitations.
We showed multiple trials (60 websites) in the span of 25 minutes to
collect data. The users may not see that many websites within such
a short time frame in real-world. Also we did not consider phishing
websites with domain validation certificates. The domain valida-
tion certificates would have made the phishing websites harder to
identify and might have reduced the accuracy of phishing website
detection across both sets of participants. Our hypothesis was that
the users with autism might be easier to deceive with respect to
phishing attacks, so we had not introduced the difficultly in our
study. Second, the participants were explicitly and directly asked
475
ACSAC ’18, December 3–7, 2018, San Juan, PR, USA

to identify real and fake websites. In real-world, they are directed
to these pages from emails or other methods. However, the users
have to eventually make the decision of real and fake implicitly and
they may perform worse in such implicit scenarios than they did in
our explicit scenario. Although we tried to imitate the real-world
scenario of web-browsing and computer usage in our study, the
participants’ performance might have been affected just due to the
fact that the study was conducted in lab. Third, we had a small par-
ticipant sample size of fifteen in each group. Our sample may not be
representative of a wider population, although it is representative
of active computer users [7] and phishing-prone populations [30].
Also, it is difficult and challenging to recruit such specific set of
participants, and other studies on autism [28], learning disabilities
[21] and journalists [19] and lawyers [19] also had similar sample
sizes of participants. Fourth, the participants without autism were
relatively better educated than the participants with autism. Even
then the participants with autism performed equally to the partici-
pants without autism in identifying phishing websites. Hence the
participants should at least perform in par with the participants
without autism and with only high school education. The control
participants without autism, above the age of 19 and with only high
school education or lower was difficult to find.
9 CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we presented a phishing detection study to under-
stand the performance of users with autism in identifying real and
fake websites. The users with autism have been found to be gullible
in previous studies. However, they are also reported to be method-
ological and detail-oriented. Our results show that the gullibility of
users with autism may not make them more susceptible to phishing
attacks, and, in fact, their detail oriented nature may make them
better equipped to combat phishing attacks, when contrasted with
the individuals without autism.
