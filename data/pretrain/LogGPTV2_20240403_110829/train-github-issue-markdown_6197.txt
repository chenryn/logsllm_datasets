### Current Behavior
Bundled dependencies do not export executables when packing.
### Expected Behavior
`npm pack` output should include scripts under `.bin` to launch any
executables provided by the bundled depdency.
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. Install any dependency that exposes an executable, e.g. `lws`.
  2. Include this dependency in `bundledDependencies`
  3. `npm pack`
The resulting artifact includes the `bundledDependency` under `node_modules`,
but does not create a `.bin` directory at all, and so the depdency's
executable(s) will not be available.
### Environment
  * Win10 20H2
  * Node: 14.15.4
  * npm: 7.4.0
