User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Where is the Apache Access Log File located (Mac Apache)? I did a little reading online, and I think that the Apache Access Log contains all of the requests sent to the server. However, I couldn't gather from the websites whether this is actually stored in an accessible text file, or in some other manner. If it is stored in a file, where is this file on the default Mac Apache install?

Assistant: The default location for the access log is:

/var/log/apache2/access_log 


The default location for the error log is:

/var/log/apache2/error_log
