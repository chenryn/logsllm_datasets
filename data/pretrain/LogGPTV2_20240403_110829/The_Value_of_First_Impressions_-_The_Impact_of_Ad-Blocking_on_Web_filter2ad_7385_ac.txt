5 Discussion
Our measurement study motivates and provides direction to work on improv-
ing the quality of experience for users of ad-blockers. The observations are not
restricted to the particular ad-blocker we used, but are equally relevant to other
ad-blocker that relies on ﬁlter lists. Any of these ad-blockers would need to check
the list of regular expressions to determine whether or not to block a requested
object. As we show, while this check may result in fewer objects being requested
and, thus, lower PLT, the extra time will negatively impact TTFP.
There is a number of possible paths to optimize ad-blockers based on their
impact on QoE. One could imagine using historical data to identify when loading
a website with ad-blocking results in a signiﬁcantly degraded TTFP/improved
PLT. For these sites, the ad-blocker could delay checking until after reaching the
TTFP not to impact a website’s initial responsiveness if a potential cost on ad
exposure.
Our analysis of ad-blocking’s impact on users’ web experience is preliminary.
Our study focuses on how ad-blocking impacts QoE performance metrics such as
PLT and TTFP, but that is only one aspect of the whole web browsing experi-
ence. Issues such as Do ad-blockers make web browsing less distracting for users?,
Do ad-blockers improve users’ data privacy?, or Despite their performance over-
head, do users prefer browsing with ad-blocking enabled? are interesting research
questions that we leave for future work.
6 Related Work
The rapid proliferation of tools to evade or block ads and their potential impact
on the web ecosystem have served as motivation to a number of recent studies.
Pujol et al. [26] examines network-wide advertisement traﬃc and infers the
prevalence of ad-block usage. The authors identify advertisement traﬃc from
passive network measurements in a residential broadband network of a European
ISP in order to assess the prevalence of ad-blockers. They found that 18% of the
total requests in the traﬃc they monitored were ad-related traﬃc.
Malloy et al. [19] studies the global prevalence and impact of ad-blockers.
Utilizing a dataset composed of information from 2 million users and more than
20 billion page views across half a million top level domains, the paper exam-
ines the pervasiveness of ad-blockers around the world. In addition to studying

the geographic, demographic, and publisher trends of ad-blockers, the ﬁnancial
impact of ad-blockers on a small set of publishers is discussed. The paper ﬁnds
that ad-blockers can signiﬁcantly impact the revenue of publishers, causing a
$3.9M/mo. negative impact on a particular publisher.
A recent study by Walls et al.
[34] focuses on Adblock Plus and the
Adblock Plus’ Acceptable Ads program. This program allows some advertise-
ment providers to pay in order to have their advertisements shown to users.
The authors measure the eﬀects of this “whitelist” in order to understand who
beneﬁts from it as well as how users perceive “acceptable” advertisements. After
running a user study to see how users perceive advertisements, they ﬁnd that
not all advertisements in Adblock Plus’ Acceptable Ads program abide by the
program’s stated policies.
Additionally, diﬀerent works have analyzed how ﬁlter lists work, particularly
with respect to anti-adblocking [37]. These works focus on understanding how
ﬁlter lists identify anti-adblocking functionality on websites. However, they don’t
examine the time it takes to process the regular expressions present in ﬁlter lists.
Other recent work has explored how to eﬀectively defend against JavaScript-
based advertisements [10,16]. These studies attempt to deﬁne ways to block
JavaScript ads without compromising the security of webpages which serve them.
They ﬁnd that a small number of rules is capable of blocking a large majority
of ads on the web.
Our work focuses on a so-far ignored potential side eﬀect of ad-blocker usage:
their impact on users’ QoE. Internet QoE, and web QoE in particular, have
received signiﬁcant attention in recent years. Much of the work has focused
on improving Web page loads, with new network protocols [17,31], new Web
architectures [22,27,28,36], and developing tools. More recent work, such as
Kelton et al. [15] and Butkiewicz et al. [6], present alternative approaches and
non-traditional metrics to model users’ QoE of experience.
7 Conclusions
The growing prevalence of online advertisements has motivated a number of
research eﬀorts to understand their scale, mechanisms, and economics while,
concurrently, fueling the adoption of services to block them. We presented the
ﬁrst detailed analysis of ad-blocking’s impact on user Web QoE. We used the
most popular web-based ad-blocker to capture the impact of ad-blocking on
common metrics of QoE for the top Alexa 5,000 websites
We found that, while ad-blocking reduction on the number of objects loaded
yields a clear improvement on page load time (PLT), for a signiﬁcant fraction of
sites this PLT improvement comes at a high cost on time to ﬁrst paint (TTFP).
We presented results from a large crowdsourced experiment with 1,000 AMT
users to understand the relative importance of these metrics on users’ experience.
We found that, surprisingly, 71.5% of times users indicated a preference for faster
TTFP over shorter PLT, hinting at the importance of ﬁrst impressions on web
quality of experience.

While extensive, our evaluation focused on just one aspect of web quality
of experience. The impact of ads or the costs/beneﬁts of ad-blockers are not
restricted to the chosen metrics of experience we used in our analysis. Under-
standing other aspects of experience with ad-blocking is left as future work. We
have also started to explore ways to leverage our ﬁndings to optimize ad-block
users’ experience, something that will become increasingly relevant as browsers
begin to move towards blocking ads [4,38].
