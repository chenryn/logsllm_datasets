User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of computing data from a HadoopRDD. The CacheManager is looking for partitions rdd_42_25, rdd_42_26, and rdd_42_27, and when they are not found, they are computed. The PythonRunner is timing the total, boot, init, and finish times for each computation. The Executor is running tasks and sending results to the driver.
