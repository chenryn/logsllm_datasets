An example of military necessity being balanced with humanity, in the cyber context, can 
be based on the fictitious attack on an enemy‟s computer system that controls the enemy‟s power 
supply.  Most power grids are controlled and monitored by supervisory control and data

acquisition (“SCADA”) systems.  Because SCADA systems are types of computer information 
systems, they are vulnerable to CNA.  A combatant commander may, therefore, decide to attack 
a SCADA system, prior to a ground assault, in order to sabotage the enemy‟s warfighting 
capability.  Although disabling the power supply might be a legitimate military objective, the 
commander must weigh this objective against humanitarian gains and losses such as extensive 
power loss, or power loss to a civilian hospital or other critical civilian objects.  Using the 
principle of humanity, targets that might be deemed critical civilian infrastructures, are protected 
under established valid military objectives.  The decision to attack critical civilian 
infrastructures, which may be a dual-use target, must be weighed against the principle of 
humanity prior to any engagement decisions.  As a note, the combatant commander is only 
required to weigh military necessity against humanity.  Taking the above example into 
consideration, a combatant commander can legally attack an enemy‟s power system, despite its 
affect on a civilian hospital, if the situation warrants it.  For example, a combatant commander is 
likely not in violation of this principle, if he decided to disable the enemy‟s power supply, after 
learning that doing so would enable the capture or kill of a high value target like Osama Bin 
Laden.  Although this is an unlikely scenario, it shows that this principle is essentially a 
judgment call that the combatant commander must make. 
3. Proportionality 
A simple way to remember the principle of proportionality is by recalling the popular 
phrase that „the ends must justify the means.‟  In other words, the incidental harm caused to 
civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete 
and direct military advantage anticipated by an attack on a military objective.60  Taking the 
60 Yoram Dinstein, The Conduct of Hostilities Under the Law of International Conflict 12-23 (2004). 
above requirement to balance military necessity and humanity into consideration, proportionality 
would be the tool by which they are balanced.  The combatant commander ordering the attack is 
responsible for making the proportionality judgment.  A corollary of the principle of 
proportionality is that the attacker has a responsibility to take reasonable steps to find out what 
collateral damage a contemplated attack may cause.61  Applying proportionality in the context of 
a power supply scenario, one can see that proportionality is the calculus applied to determine 
whether the benefits from achieving the military objectives outweigh its negative collateral 
effects such as extensive power loss to the civilian population. 
Once hostilities have begun, it is important to remember that a combatant commander 
must consider three factors when deciding if a target can be attacked: Distinction; Balancing 
Military Necessity with Humanity; and Proportionality. As discussed infra it is important to 
realize how these three principles apply to acts of Cyber Warfare. 
IV.  Well-Known and Often-Discussed Cyber Warfare Issues 
The media, academic, military, and technology communities give vast attention to the 
topic of cyber warfare.  Although much scrutiny has been given to the current laws of cyber 
warfare, the majority of criticisms argue that the current legal framework cannot address 
warfighting in cyberspace.  Many people believe that the traditional laws of war are inadequate 
and should be rewritten.  Others believe that nations should enter into an international treaty for 
fighting cyber warfare.  This paper argues that the traditional laws of war can aptly guide nations 
in conducting and defending against cyber warfare.  Before doing so, I provide commentary on 
three well-known issues that are often discussed in the cyber warfare community.  First, the “use 
of force” debate is described.  Second, the popular, but inaccurate “cyber arms race” analogy is 
61 Id. 
discussed.  Third, proposals for the creation of an international treaty for cyber warfare are 
explained. 
A. The “Use of Force” Debate 
As it relates to Cyber Warfare, a primary concern of jus ad bellum is whether a particular 
action of CNA equates to a “use of force” or “armed attack” under UN Articles 2(4), 39, or 51.62  
Based on these three UN Articles, the legality of a pre-hostility action depends on where that 
action falls along an imaginary spectrum of force.63  This imaginary spectrum includes three 
zones: (1) below the threshold of a use of force under Article 2(4); (2) a use of force under 
Article 2(4) but shy of an armed attack under Article 51; or (3) an armed attack under Article 51 
giving the victim state the right to respond to self-defense.  Although “use of force” is commonly 
understood to consist of a kinetic military attack, such as an air strike, Article 2(4) also applies to 
“physical force of a non-military nature committed by any state agency.”64 
Scholars contend that determining when a particular act of CNA constitutes a use of force 
or an armed attack is difficult.  “The dilemma lies in the fact that CNA spans the spectrum of 
consequentiality.  Its effects freely range from mere inconvenience (e.g., shutting down an 
academic network temporarily) to physical destruction (e.g., as in creating a hammering 
phenomenon in oil pipelines so as to cause them to burst) to death (e.g., shutting down power to 
a hospital with no back-up generators).”65  Because of this perceived dilemma, Schmitt proposed 
seven factors to determine whether a particular act of CNA amounts to a use of force under the 
62 See generally THOMAS C. WINGFIELD, THE LAW OF INFORMATION CONFLICT Part II (2000).

Normative Framework, 37 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT‟L L. 885, 912 (1999). 
UN charter.66 To analyze a CNA issue jus ad bellum, Schmitt recommends applying a 
consequence based analysis using the following factors: (1) Severity; (2) Immediacy; (3) 
Directness; (4) Invasiveness; (5) Measurability; (6) Presumptive Legitimacy; and (7) 
Responsibility.  Here, Professor Schmitt attempts to provide a multi-factor approach for 
determining whether a CNA amounts to an armed attack, explaining that:  
First, a cyber attack is an armed attack justifying a forceful response in self-defense if it 
causes physical damage or human injury or is part of a larger operation that constitutes an 
armed attack. Second, self-defense is justified when a cyber attack us an irrevocable step 
in an imminent (near-term) and unavoidable attack (preparing the battlefield). Finally, a 
State may react defensively during the last possible window of opportunity available to 
effectively counter an armed attack when no reasonable doubt exists that the attack is 
forthcoming.67 
Although Schmitt‟s proposes a multi-factor test to determine when an act of CNA 
equates to a “use of force,” at the onset, and as discussed supra, it is important to consider that 
the UN Security Council, prior to the commencement of hostilities, generally prohibits uses of 
force except for the two situations authorized by the UN Charter.68  First, the Security Council 
has the sole authority and discretion to ratify (or sanction) any use of force; to include a very 
mild cyber attack.69  Here, the author highlights the potential ratification or sanctioning of a 
“mild” cyber attack to emphasize the UN Council‟s broad authority; a cyber attack need not be

(2003); Schmitt, supra note 28 at 914-15.  
67 Id. Similar to Schmitt‟s analysis, Thomas Wingfield also suggests a multi-factor approach to determine whether a 
CNA amounts to an armed attack.  Arguing that “an armed attack may occur when a use of force or an activity not 
traditionally considered an armed attack is used in such a way that it becomes tantamount in effect to an armed 
attack.” Wingfield proposes three factors to consider when looking at whether an activity is tantamount to an armed 
attack: scope; duration; and intensity. WINGFIELD, supra note 62, at 113. 
68 See supra Part III.A. 
69 See supra Part III.A.  
of epic proportions to fall under the purview of the UN Council.  For example, if China defaced a 
United States Government website, which is arguably a mild act, and likely wouldn‟t amount to 
a use of force under Schmitt‟s analysis, then the UN Council has the power to ratify or sanction 
that act.  “The U.N. General Assembly defined aggression to include the use of „any weapons‟ 
against another state.  The use of such a clearly broad term as „any‟ logically implies that the use 
of even minor weapons against a state could be considered an act of aggression, if the 
circumstances are of “sufficient gravity.”70  Thus, although unlikely, if a nation state sanctions 
the throwing of a stone towards another nation‟s embassy, then that mild act could be considered 
a use of force.  This general prohibition also applies to the use of cyber weapons.  Because the 
UN Charter generally forbids all uses of force, there is no need to engage in a multi-factor 
analysis.  Second, Article 51 of the UN Charter provides for the right of countries to engage in 
military action in self defense, including collective self-defense.71  Taking these two exceptions 
into consideration, it follows that a CNA equates to a use of force if and whenever the UN 
Council says so.  If the UN Council determines that a CNA is a use of force, then the UN 
Council has the discretion to ratify or sanction it.72  Said differently, anytime a nation state 
chooses to conduct CNA, that nation is taking a risk that the UN Council may sanction the act, 
because a use of force is assumed to be prohibited.  In addition, a country is allowed to engage in 
CNA or use force, if the CNA is a recognizable act of self-defense.73  Similar to the authorities 
granted pursuant to Articles 39 and 41, the UN Council has the authority to determine whether 
an act of self defense is a reasonable one. Thus, a nation conducting any CNA, prior to 
hostilities, is legally doing so only in the case of reasonable self-defense; if self-defense is not

Definition, 64 A.F.L. REV. 65, 84 (2009).

72 See supra Part III.A.

involved, then the nation actor is conducting CNA with the risk of being sanctioned by the UN 
Council. This may imply that the UN Council needs to implement means of monitoring all state-
sponsored acts of CNA and become more aggressive in holding countries accountable for cyber 
acts, which is a challenge in and of itself, but it does not imply that the international laws of war 
are inadequate. 
One may consider whether the UN Council should then adopt a uniform multi-factor test 
when reviewing cyber acts, similar to the test proposed by Schmitt.  This framework would give 
the UN Council a set of factors for deciding whether to ratify or sanction a particular CNA.  The 
dynamic nature of cyber warfare and the rate of technology advancement makes a “multi-factor 
test” a horrible candidate for a single and dispositive test for determining the legitimacy of a 
CNA.  Professor Barton Beebe of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law gives a stunning 
critique of legal multi-factor tests.74  Beebe argues that although no particular factor is said to be 
dispositive in most multi-factor tests, in practice “judges employ „fast and frugal‟ heuristics to 
short-circuit the multifactor analysis. . . [and that] [a] few factors prove to be decisive; the rest 
are at best redundant and at worst irrelevant.”75  Although Beebe‟s gives a general critique to 
multi-factor tests, his arguments are more relevant in the context of cyber warfare.  With the 
dynamic nature of cyber warfare, and in light of the above criticism, a multi-factor test would be 
highly restrictive and should not be used as the one and only standard to assess the legitimacy of 
a CNA.  The UN Council should maintain its broad authority to ratify or sanction acts of CNA, 
while using whatever methodology to do so as the situation warrants.  Those who promote this 
issue as a major debate are misconstruing the UN‟s broad authority, ignoring the general

prohibition against all uses of force, and therefore, mistakenly concluding that international law 
is silent on the issue.              
B. The Misleading Cyber Arms Race Analogy 
Some analysts believe that the U.S., China, Russia and others are locked in a “Cyber 
Arms Race,” reminiscent of the Nuclear Arms Race between the U.S. and Russia that became 
known as The Cold War.76  In fact, a recent Defense Tech article goes so far as to make a direct 
comparison of the current cyber climate to the Cold War: 
A „dead heat‟ is a race, campaign or other contest that is so close that it is 
impossible to predict the winner. That‟s what it looks like when it comes to the 
continuing race for cyber warfare supremacy, and experts agree this will be the 
case for the foreseeable future. With images of the Cold War and its associated 
arms race, as cyber warfare, cyber espionage, cyber attacks and cyber terrorism 
continues to evolve the top three leaders (US, Russia and China) are jockeying for 
position. 77 
Although the notion of a Cyber Arms Race makes a great cover story, this comparison is 
simply misleading.78  It is a direct attempt to compare military cyber capabilities to nuclear 
weapons, and uses this comparison to give the exaggerated perception that some grave and 
imminent cyber danger exists that can only be prevented with the creation of “international cyber 
treaties;” similar to today‟s current Nuclear Treaties.

C. Proposals for International Treaty for Cyber War. 
Legal scholars have criticized the law of war as outdated as it relates to cyber warfare, 
and therefore call for the creation of an International Treatise for Cyber Warfare.79  For example, 
Davis Brown suggests that applying the current law of war to cyber and information warfare 
“erroneously assumes that warfare by computer is not significantly different from warfare with 
kinetic weapons such as bombs and bullets.” 80  Brown goes on to caution against assuming that 
conventional law of war “will resolve all of the new issues raised by the use of malicious code, 
denial-of-service attacks, and control of vital systems when used against the enemy.”  To support 
the above contention, Brown points out two paradigms that have emerged due to cyber and 
information warfare.  First, that there is a shift in favored weaponry from kinetic weapons
