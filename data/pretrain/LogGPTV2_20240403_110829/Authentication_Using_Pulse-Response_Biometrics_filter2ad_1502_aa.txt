Abstract—We propose a new biometric based on the human
body’s response to an electric square pulse signal, that we call
pulse-response. We explore how this biometric can be used to
enhance security in the context of two example applications: (1)
as an additional authentication mechanism in PIN entry systems,
and (2) as a continuous authentication mechanism on a secure
terminal. The pulse-response biometric is effective because each
human body exhibits a unique response to a signal pulse applied
at the palm of one hand, and measured at the palm of the other.
Using a prototype setup, we show that users can be correctly
identiﬁed, with high probability, in a matter of seconds. This
identiﬁcation mechanism integrates very well with other well-
established methods and offers a reliable additional
layer of
additional security, either on a continuous basis or at login time.
We build a proof-of-concept prototype and perform experiments
to validate the feasability of using pulse-response as a biometric.
Our results are very encuraging: we achieve accuracies of 100%
over a static data set and 88% over a data set with samples taken
over several weeks.

INTRODUCTION
Many modern access control systems augment the traditional
two-factor authentication procedure (something you know and
something you have) with a third factor: “something you are”,
i.e., some form of biometric authentication. This additional layer
of security comes in many ﬂavors: from ﬁngerprint readers on
laptops used to facilitate easy login with a single ﬁnger swipe,
to iris scanners used as auxiliary authentication for accessing
secure facilities. In the latter case, the authorized user typically
presents a smart card, then types in a PIN, and ﬁnally performs
an iris (or ﬁngerprint) scan.
In this paper, we propose a new biometric based on the
human body’s response to a square pulse signal. We consider
two motivating sample scenarios:
The ﬁrst is the traditional access control setting described
above where the biometric is used as an additional layer of
security when a user enters a PIN, e.g., into a bank ATM. The
pulse-response biometric facilitates uniﬁcation of the steps of
PIN entry and biometric capture. We use PIN entry as a running
example for this scenario throughout the paper. This is because
PIN pads are often made of metal, which makes capturing

pulse-response biometric straightforward: a user would place
one hand on a metal pad adjacent to the key-pad, while using
the other hand to enter a PIN. The metal pad would transmit the
pulse and a sensor in the PIN pad would capture the biometric.
The second scenario corresponds to continuous authenti-
cation. One example is verifying that the user, who securely
logged in earlier, is still the same person currently present at
the keyboard. To address this problem, we need a mechanism
that continuously monitors the user’s biometrics. However, for
obvious usability reasons, this must be done unobtrusively.
The pulse-response biometric is particularly well-suited for this
setting. Assuming that it can be made from – or coated by –
some conductive material, the keyboard would generate the
pulse signal and measure response, while the user (remaining
oblivious) is typing. The main idea is that the user’s pulse-
response is captured at login time and identity of the person
currently at the keyboard can be veriﬁed transparently, at desired
frequency.
The continuous authentication problem is particularly dif-
ﬁcult to solve using traditional biometrics. For example, if
ﬁngerprints are used instead of pulse-response, the user would
have to interrupt work to periodically swipe a ﬁnger on a
scanner, which would be very disruptive. There have been
some attempts to solve this problem using a webcam and face
recognition [12], [21], [23]. However, such systems can be
fooled by a photo of the legitimate user and they also require
the user to keep the head in a more-or-less constant position,
unless a more advanced head tracking system is used.
To assess efﬁcacy and feasibility of the pulse-response
biometric, we built a platform that enables us to gather pulse-
response data. Its main purpose is to verify that we can identify
users from a population of test subjects. We also used it to
test the distinguishing ability and stability of this biometric
over time. We also explored two systems that apply the pulse-
response biometric to the two sample scenarios discussed above:
one to unobtrusively capture the biometric as an additional layer
of security when entering a PIN, and the other – to implement
continuous authentication.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section II
provides some background on biometrics and presents our
design goals. Section III describes the pulse-response biometric
in detail. Sections IV and V present
the PIN entry and
continuous authentication systems, respectively. Section VI
describes the biometric data capture setup and Section VII
presents experimental results. Related work is overviewed in
Section VIII and the paper concludes with Section IX.
II. BACKGROUND
This section provides some biometrics background and
summarizes the terminology used throughout the paper. Then,
design goals are presented.
A. Biometrics
The meaning of the term biometric varies depending on con-
text. The US National Science & Technology Council’s (NSTC)
Subcommittee on Biometrics describes its two valid meanings:
(1) a measurable biological (anatomical and physiological) and
behavioral characteristic that can be used for automated recog-
nition of individuals, (2) an automated method of recognizing
an individual based on measurable biological (anatomical and
physiological) and behavioral characteristics [6]. Throughout
the rest of this paper we use biometric in the former sense, i.e.,
as a characteristic of a particular individual.
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) divides biometric measurements into two categories [25],
physiological and behavioural. The former relies on the physiol-
ogy of a person and includes: ﬁngerprints, hand geometry, facial
recognition, speech analysis, and iris/retina scans. Behavioral
biometrics is based on user behaviour and includes: keystroke
timings, speech pattern analysis, gait recognition, and analysis
of stylus pressure, acceleration and shape in hand-writing.
Physiological biometrics can help identify an individual
from a large pool of candidates. However, there are some
caveats. In general, physiological biometrics are considered
moderately difﬁcult to circumvent. For example, although hand
geometry is very stable over the course of one’s adult life, it
does not provide enough distinguishing power to be used as the
only means for identiﬁcation [6]. Also, some facial recognition
systems can be fooled by an appropriately-sized photo of a
legitimate user. This is certainly a weakness if facial recognition
is used to unlock a smartphone. On the other hand, the failure
might not be due to the biometric itself but to inadequacy of
current technology.
Behavioral biometrics measure user actions over time,
meaning that, for each action, there must be a beginning, an
end, and a duration. Consequently, behavioural biometrics in-
directly measure characteristics of the human body. Behavioral
biometrics are learned and, therefore, can be also re-learned.
However the consensus in the literature seems to be, that
after reaching a certain age, changes in behaviour become
more difﬁcult to achieve, even with speciﬁc and sustained
effort [31]. Behavioural biometrics can therefore be regarded
as valid biometric identiﬁers, even though they are neither as
unique, nor as permanent as physiological biometrics. In most
cases, behaviour biometrics are used to discern a user from a
small(er) pool of candidates. One advantage is that they are
less invasive and therefore more user-friendly. For example, a
system that analyses keystroke timings or speech patterns can
usually do so in the background. Whereas, an iris or ﬁngerprint
scan mandates speciﬁc user actions.
There is an ongoing debate about whether DNA constitutes a
valid biometric. As a measurable part of the human physiology,
it can very accurately identify an individual. In that sense, it is
certainly a physiological biometric. However according to most
deﬁnitions, e.g., [6], a biometric must be a characteristic that
can be used for automated recognition of individuals. Thus,
DNA’s labeling as a biometric is questionable, at least for
the time being. Albeit, one could imagine a future technology
whereby DNA samples are continuously taken (and analyzed)
from a user typing at a keyboard, e.g., by sampling body oils
secreted by ﬁngertips.
B. Biometric Authentication vs. Identiﬁcation
Authentication refers to identify conﬁrmation or veriﬁcation.
When a user claims a certain identity (e.g., by inserting a card
into an ATM or entering a userid into a terminal, and then
typing in a PIN or a password) authentication entails deciding
whether the claim is correct. The goal of the biometric classiﬁer
is to compare the current sample to the known template for
that user. The classiﬁer returns the likelihood a match. We refer
to this kind of comparison as 1:1.
Authentication differs from identiﬁcation, where the current
sample comes from an unknown user, and the job of the
biometric classiﬁer is to match it to a known sample. We call
this a 1:n comparison. Identiﬁcation is further divided into two
types: open-set and closed-set.1 We say that an identiﬁcation
is closed-set, if it is known a priori that the user is in the
classiﬁer’s database, i.e., the classiﬁer must choose the best
match from a pool of candidates. Otherwise, we refer to it as
open-set identiﬁcation.
C. Design Goals
When designing a new biometric system it is important to
take into account lessons learned from past and current systems.
There are good discussions of design goals for biometric
systems in the literature, e.g., [14]. Ours are as follows:
Universal: The biometric must be universally applicable,
to the extent required by the application. For example, if a
ﬁngerprint reader is added as an additional level of access
control, what to do about people that are missing all or some
ﬁngers? It is important for the biometric to apply to everyone
intended to use the system.
Unique: The biometric must be unique within the target
population. Measuring someones height would not work as
an identiﬁcation mechanism on a large scale. At the same
time, (adult) height alone can usually identify individual family
members.
Permanent: The biometric must be consistent over the time
period where it’s used. Very few biometrics will stay constant
over a lifetime, e.g., face geometry, voice, gait and writing.
However, as long as the biometric is consistent over the lifetime
of the system, these biometrics work well.
Unobtrusive: A good biometric should be maximally
unobtrusive. If the user can be identiﬁed passively, without
interference, the biometric is much more likely to be accepted.
Difﬁcult to circumvent: This is essential for a biometric in
any security context. Ideally, a user should be unable to change
the biometric at all. Moreover, it must certainly be the case that
a user can not modify the biometric to match that of another
user.

An additional common design goal that we achieve “for
free” is Collectability. It means that the biometric can be
measured quantitatively. Since pulse-response biometric is
based on measuring an electronic signal, no extra features
are needed to achieve this goal.
There are a few other goals commonly found in the literature
that we do not emphasize here:
Acceptability: The biometric is one that users are likely
to feel comfortable with. It is hard to predict what users will
or will not be comfortable with. Clearly, acceptability is a
sensible design goal but it is one that we are not able to make
signiﬁcant claims about, so we have chosen not to present it
as a requirement.
Cost Effectiveness: The relationship between the distinguish-
ing power of the biometric and its deployment and maintainance
costs. Since we focus on assessment of a new biometric and
building a prototype, it is premature to seek insights about
costs of a possible commercial system.
The same argument applies for Performance: the biometric
should require minimal resources.
III. PULSE-RESPONSE BIOMETRIC
The pulse-response biometric works by applying a low
voltage pulse signal to the palm of one hand and measuring
the body’s response in the palm of the other hand. The signal
travels up through the user’s arm, across the torso, and down
the other arm. The biometric is captured by measuring the
response in the user’s hand. This response is then transformed
to the frequency domain via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
This transformation yields the individual frequency components
(bins) of the response signal, which form raw data that is
then fed to the classiﬁer. Working in the frequency domain
eliminates any need for aligning the pulses when they are
measured. Details of our measurement setup and experiments
can be found in Section VII.
The main reason for this biometric’s ability to distinguish
between users is due to subtle differences in body conductivity,
at different frequencies, among different people. When a signal
pulse is applied to one palm and measured in the other, the
current has to travel through the body tissue – blood vessels,
muscle, fat tissue, cartilage and bones – to reach the other
hand. Differences in bone structure, muscle density, fat content
and layout of blood vessels, result in slight differences in
the attenuation of the signal at different frequencies. These
differences show up as differences in the magnitude of the
frequency bins after the FFT. This is what allows us to
distinguish between individuals.
Pulse-response is a physiological biometric since it measures
a person’s physiological characteristics, rather than how that
person behaves. However, it has an attractive property normally
associated with behavioral biometrics: it can be captured in a
completely passive way. Although some other biometrics also
have this passive capture property, e.g., face recognition, pulse-
response is not as easily circumventable. The combination of
unobtrusiveness and difﬁculty to circument makes it a very
attractive identiﬁcation mechanism. Essentially it offers the best
properties of both physiological and behavioral biometrics.
At the same time, pulse-response requires special-purpose
hardware. The same is true any other physiological biometric.
For example, ﬁngerprints need a ﬁngerprint reader, face
recognition requires a precision camera and hand geometry
– a scanner. Since pulse-response is captured using electrical
signals, there are few restrictions on the exact construction
of the biometrics capture hardware. We explore this issue in
Sections IV and V.
A. Liveness and Replay
A common problem with many biometric systems is liveness
detection,
i.e., determining whether the biometric sample
represents a “live” user or a replay. For example, a ﬁngerprint
reader would want to detect whether the purported user’s
ﬁngerprint was produced by a real ﬁnger attached to a human,
as opposed to a ﬁngerprint mold made of putty or even a
severed ﬁnger. Similarly, a face recognition system would need
to make sure that it is not being fooled by a user’s photo. More
details and concrete examples are given in Section VIII).
In traditional biometric systems, liveness is usually ad-
dressed via some form of active authentication, e.g., a challenge-
response mechanism. In a face recognition system a user might
be asked to turn his head or look at a particular point during
the authentication process. Although this reduces the chance of
a photo passing for the real person, the user is forced to take
active part in the process, which can be disruptive and annoying
if authentication happens on a continuous basis. Also, a good
3-D model of a human head can still fool such measures.
Fingerprint scanners often include some protection against
replay. This might be accomplished by detecting other charac-
teristics normally associated with a live ﬁnger, e.g., temperature,
or presence of sweat or skin oils. Such counter-measures make
it more difﬁcult to use skin-tight gloves or a “cold dead ﬁngers”
to fool the biometric system. Still, replay remains a major
challenge, especially, for low-end ﬁngerprint readers.
In the context of the pulse-response biometric, unlike ﬁnger-
prints or face recognition, it is difﬁcult (but not impossible) to
separate the biometric from the individual to whom it belongs.
If the adversary manages to capture a user’s pulse-response on
some compromised hardware, replaying it successfully would
require specialized hardware that mimics the exact conductivity
of the original user. We believe that this is feasible: the
adversary can devise a contraption that consists of ﬂat adhesive-
covered electrodes attached to each ﬁnger-tip (ﬁve for each
hand going into one terminal) with a single wire connecting
the two terminals. The pulse response of the electrode-wire-
electrode has to exactly replicate that of the target user. Having
attached electrodes to each ﬁnger-tip, the adversary can type on
the keyboard and the system could thus be effectively fooled.
However, the effort required is signiﬁcantly harder than in cases
of facial recognition (where a photo sufﬁces) or ﬁngerprints,
which are routinely left (and can be lifted from) numerous
innocuous locations.
Furthermore, in contrast to face or ﬁngerprint biometrics,
pulse-response can be made to depend on the capture platform.
Thus, even if the adversary captures this biometric on one piece
of hardware, it would not mach the user’s measurements on a
different measurement (capturing) system. One way to achieve
this is to add a speciﬁc (frequency-dependent) resistance to
3
the measurement platform, i.e., electrodes and/or wiring. If the
adversary uses its own capture system to measure the user,
there is an additional signature which is actually part of the
pulse-response reader.
Finally, the real power of the pulse-response biometric
is evident when used for continuous authentication (see
Section V). Here, the person physically uses a secure terminal
and constantly touches the keyboard as part of routine work.
Authentication happens on a continuous basis and it is not
feasible to use the terminal while at the same time providing
false input signals to the authentication system. Of course, the
adversary could use thick gloves, thereby escaping detection,
but the authentication system will see input from the keyboard
without the expected pulse-response measurement to accompany
it, and will lock the session.
B. Ethics and User Safety
As mentioned above,
the pulse-response biometric is
captured by applying low voltage to one hand of the user
and measuring the resulting signal in the other. This involves
current ﬂowing through signiﬁcant portions of the human body.
This process naturally raises questions about user safety and
ethics. We believe that these are important issues that need to
be addressed. The issue of safety might be compounded by
users having undocumented or undisclosed medical conditions,
including implantable medical devices, e.g., pacemakers, or
other devices that may be adversely affected by applying an
external signal to the body.
Two primary causes for concern are voltage and current
levels that are applied to a user. An average healthy human
being can easily withstand farily high voltage levels (  500/ V )
provided that the current level is low. Strength of current
sent through the body is of greater importance to human
safety. Studies have shown that currents as low 1 mA can
be perceived as slight tingling and currents as low as 5 mA
are uncomfortable [28]. For this reason we chose to add a
10 k⌦ output resistor to our signal generator, to act as a current
limiting device. The 10 k⌦ resistor insures that – even if the
output terminals of the signal generator are shorted out – the
maximum current strength will not exceed 0.1 mA per volt
of input signal. Our initial experiments were done using three
different voltage levels: 1V, 5V and 10V. The 5V and 10V
levels where used on a small set of volunteers as a parameter
search, in order to identify the minimal voltage level for the
biometric to work. It quickly became apparent that very good
results could be obtained using only a 1V signal.
The amount of current that a particular voltage induces in
the human body varies from person to person and depends
on external conditions. For example, if a subject’s hands are
wet, conductivity is signiﬁcantly higher (i.e., resistance is
signiﬁcantly lower) than with dry hands. The same is true
if the subject’s hands have cuts or broken skin close to where
the signal is applied. If resistance is lowered, current strength
increases according to Ohm’s law. Normal resistance of the
human body is between 1, 000 and 5, 000 ⌦. However, even in
extreme conditions, resistance does not drop bellow 500 ⌦. With
our current limiting resistor on the signal generator, the worst
case current (with 10V test signal) is 10V /10.5k⌦= 0 .95 mA,
which is bellow the sensitivity limit. The vast majority of
subjects were only exposed to a 1V signal, which translates
into the worst case current strength of 0.095 mA.
All subjects were given detailed information about the nature
of the experiment beforehand and all were given the opportunity
to opt out. None expressed any discomfort or, in fact, any
perception of the current during the experiments.
We note that many commercial systems and products involve
applying a similar (or higher) voltage to humans. For example,
so-called “touch lamps” (popular since 1970-s) turn on and off
whenever the user touches the metal frame. The lamp’s touch
detection mechanism works by having the user close an electric
circuit between the lamp and the ground, i.e., the current takes
a path similar to that in our pulse-response capture system.
The magnitude of the signal (1-6V) used in touch lamps is
similar to our case. Such lamps are commercially available
