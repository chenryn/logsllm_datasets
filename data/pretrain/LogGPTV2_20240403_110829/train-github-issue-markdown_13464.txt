Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I encountered an issue while setting up a new build machine. I was not paying as much attention as I should have, and the build process failed. Below is the relevant excerpt from the build log:

```
checking for C compiler default output file name... a.exe
checking whether the C compiler works... yes
checking whether we are cross compiling... no
checking for suffix of executables... .exe
checking for suffix of object files... o
checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yes
checking whether gcc accepts -g... yes
checking for gcc option to accept ISO C89... none needed
checking whether we are using the GNU C++ compiler... yes
checking whether g++ accepts -g... yes
checking how to run the C preprocessor... gcc -E
checking build system type... Invalid configuration `x86_64-pc-msys': system `msys' not recognized
configure: error: /bin/sh ../autoconf/config.sub x86_64-pc-msys failed
Makefile:369: recipe for target 'llvm-3.3/build_Release/config.status' failed
make[2]: *** [llvm-3.3/build_Release/config.status] Error 1
Makefile:43: recipe for target 'julia-release' failed
make[1]: *** [julia-release] Error 2
Makefile:32: recipe for target 'release' failed
make: *** [release] Error 2
```

Upon further investigation, it appears that the problem lies in the LLVM `configure` script, which is unable to detect the build system. The following system information may be relevant:

```
$ uname -a
MSYS_NT-6.1 VM-Win7x64 2.0.0(0.272/5/3) 2014-03-19 13:02 x86_64 Msys
```

To ensure that the repository is up to date, I checked the remote and the latest commit:

```
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git (push)

$ git show --oneline
898962c Merge pull request #6200 from JuliaLang/sjk/sprintf
```

I also updated `autoconf` using `pacman -S autoconf`, but the build still failed with the same error.

Please note that I have not performed a bisect and am not implicating this particular commit. I will investigate recent changes to the makefiles when I return on Monday.
