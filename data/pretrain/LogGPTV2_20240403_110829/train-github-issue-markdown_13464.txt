Well this is a downer. I just spun up a new build machine and started cruising
through the build, probably not paying as much attention as I should. Here's
an excerpt:
    checking for C compiler default output file name... a.exe
    checking whether the C compiler works... yes
    checking whether we are cross compiling... no
    checking for suffix of executables... .exe
    checking for suffix of object files... o
    checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yes
    checking whether gcc accepts -g... yes
    checking for gcc option to accept ISO C89... none needed
    checking whether we are using the GNU C++ compiler... yes
    checking whether g++ accepts -g... yes
    checking how to run the C preprocessor... gcc -E
    checking build system type... Invalid configuration `x86_64-pc-msys': system `msys' not recognized
    configure: error: /bin/sh ../autoconf/config.sub x86_64-pc-msys failed
    Makefile:369: recipe for target 'llvm-3.3/build_Release/config.status' failed
    make[2]: *** [llvm-3.3/build_Release/config.status] Error 1
    Makefile:43: recipe for target 'julia-release' failed
    make[1]: *** [julia-release] Error 2
    Makefile:32: recipe for target 'release' failed
    make: *** [release] Error 2
Digging into the /deps/llvm-* and doing a `make` there confirms that the
problem is that the LLVM `configure` is not detecting the build system.

Just to be safe I did a `pacman -S autoconf` \-- same build failure after
updating autoconf.
Note that I have **not** bisected and I am not implicating this particular
commit of course. I'll look for recent changes to the makefiles when I get
back Monday.
