It appears that the issue you're encountering with `pip` is due to spaces in your Python installation path. To resolve this without having to reinstall Python in a directory without spaces, you can add the Python executable's path to your system's `PATH` environment variable. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Verify the Python Installation Path:**
   - Ensure that the folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Python33` contains the Python executable (`python.exe`). If your Python version or installation location differs, adjust the path accordingly.

2. **Add the Path to the `PATH` Environment Variable:**
   - Open the **Control Panel**.
   - Navigate to **System and Security** > **System** > **Advanced System Settings**.
   - Click on the **Environment Variables** button.
   - In the **System Variables** section, find and select the `Path` variable, then click **Edit**.
   - In the **Edit Environment Variable** window, click **New** and enter the path to your Python executable, e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Python33`.
   - Click **OK** to save the changes and close all open windows.

3. **Verify the Changes:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt window and type `python --version` to ensure that the Python executable is correctly recognized.
   - Similarly, type `pip --version` to verify that `pip` is working as expected.

By following these steps, you should be able to use `pip` without issues, even if your Python installation path contains spaces.
