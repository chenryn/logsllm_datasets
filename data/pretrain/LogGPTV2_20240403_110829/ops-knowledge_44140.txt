User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: Please add this address : 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Python33

in Windows PATH Variable
Though first make sure this is the folder where Python exe file resides, then only add this path to the PATH variable.
To append addresses in PATH variable, Please go to 

Control Panel -> Systems -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment
  Variables -> System Variables -> Path -> Edit ->

Then append the above mentioned path & click Save
