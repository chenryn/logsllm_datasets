From this http://jsbin.com/iDiZUf/6/edit?js,output snippet, you can reproduce
by:
  1. Load page: http://jsbin.com/iDiZUf/6/edit?js,output
  2. Click glyphicon-question-sign next to "Preapplication"
  3. Click "1. Type of Submission"
  4. Click "1. Type of Submission" again.
  5. Try to click glyphicon-question-sign next to "Changed/Corrected Application"
The behavior you find is that the click from 5. does not show the popover as
expected. I suspected this was a z-index related issue and oniijin from IRC
helped troubleshoot. Oniijin suggested modifying the javascript:
    $('.easyPopover').on('click', function (e) {
      $('.in').css('z-index','-1');
      $('.easyPopover').not(this).popover('hide');
      $(this).popover('toggle');
      $('.in').css('z-index','10');
    });
With the z-index handling in-place - popover starts behaving more like I
expected. I suspect this is the way it should behave out of the box, but I am
not certain. My goal in starting down this entire path, was to ensure that
only one popover appeared to the user at a time. Thanks, L
