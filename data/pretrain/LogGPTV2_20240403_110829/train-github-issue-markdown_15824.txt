I have quite a large number of hosts to manage and they can be categorised
into different groups depending on how you work on them. So I'd like to be
able to do the following which currently seems impossible:
[dc1-frontend-slaves]  
f-slave-[01:10].dc1.domain.com
[dc1-backend-slaves]  
b-slave-[01:10].dc1.domain.com
[dc2-frontend-slaves]  
f-slave-[01:10].dc2.domain.com
[dc2-backend-slaves]  
b-slave-[01:10].dc2.domain.com
[dc1-slaves]  
dc1-frontend-slaves  
dc1-backend-slaves
[dc2-slaves]  
dc2-frontend-slaves  
dc2-backend-slaves
[all-slaves]  
dc1-slaves  
dc2-slaves
or
[all-slaves]  
dc1-frontend-slaves  
dc1-backend-slaves  
dc2-frontend-slaves  
dc2-backend-slaves
which would have the same result.
This avoids duplication of names anywhere and also allows a more hierarchical
definition.
The example may look far fetched but real-life usage, at least where I work,
would allow me to simplify somewhat the rather large ansible file I'm
currently using.
