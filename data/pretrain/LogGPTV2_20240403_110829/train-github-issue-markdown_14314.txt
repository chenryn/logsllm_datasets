It is often the case that multiple CSS classes are used for an element, and
sometimes they are dynamically generated. In such situations the client code
needs to concatenate them into a string
    const classes = getCSSClasses();
    return (
         foo 
    );
I always felt the need to be able to pass the classes as an array:
    const classes = getCSSClasses();
    return (
         foo 
    );
In addition to the convenience of such a property, maybe it could help with
performance, in the sense that equality could be checked before string
concatenation, and only do the concatenation if the element needs to be
rendered.
The drawback here is of course the mutable nature of an array. I imagine
performance would be better if the array would be immutable. So maybe this new
property could work only with some immutable array implementation. Or frozen
arrays.
In short, I want such a property for convenience, but maybe it also has
potential for some performance improvements.
