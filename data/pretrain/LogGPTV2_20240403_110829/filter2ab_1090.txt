**ATT&CK ID:** G0094  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Kimsuky

Kimsuky, a threat actor, has employed several methods to achieve persistence on compromised systems. Specifically, they have placed scripts in the startup folder and modified the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce` Registry key. These actions ensure that their malicious code executes automatically when the system starts, thereby maintaining long-term access.
