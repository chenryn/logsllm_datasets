User: Which of these would you pick for a B2B app (targeting small/med-small businesses) built on GAE with python:

Google Accounts
Custom Users with Django
Custom Users with Web2Py

I'm very tempted to go the Google Accounts route as it's very well integrated into GAE and takes care of everything from user creation to session authentication, and even takes care of forgotten passwords. However, I'm sure there are significant drawbacks to this, including usability, but if you are starting from scratch, which approach would you pick and why?
