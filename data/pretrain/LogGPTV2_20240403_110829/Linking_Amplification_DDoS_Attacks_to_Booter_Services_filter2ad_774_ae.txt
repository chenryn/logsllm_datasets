### Introduction

Our work focuses on the development of methodologies to attribute amplification Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to their originating booter services. While this may appear similar to other research in the field, there are key distinctions in both the objectives and the methods employed. Other studies often use probabilistic reasoning to identify scanners that provide necessary reconnaissance for attacks. In contrast, our approach leverages machine learning techniques to link attacks directly to the booter services. Additionally, the applications differ: while other work aims to pressure service providers to cease illegal activities, our research generates forensic evidence that can be used in legal proceedings to prosecute specific booter services.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive exploration of techniques for attributing amplification DDoS attacks to booter services. We introduce two precise attribution methods based on carefully selected features, which are integrated into a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier. To evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques, we subscribed to a small set of booter services and conducted self-attacks to create a ground truth dataset. The ethical framework for this data collection is similar to that used in a previous study [7].

Our honeypot-driven technique achieves a very high precision of over 99% for DNS and NTP attacks, with a recall of over 69.35% in the most challenging real-time attribution scenarios. Further analysis revealed that 25.53% (49,297) of the observed DNS attacks and 13.34% (38,520) of the NTP attacks can be attributed to just 7 and 15 booter services, respectively. These findings have been shared with law enforcement agencies to assist in prioritizing legal actions against these booter services.

The second technique we developed extracts features from a victim's network traces and attributes attacks from the victim's perspective. This opens the possibility of offering a centralized DDoS attribution service, allowing victims to determine the source of the attacks they face and even compare different attacks to identify if they were launched by the same actor (booter).
