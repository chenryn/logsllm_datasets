to be the attacking infrastructure. Although their work might seem similar to
ours at ﬁrst, there are key diﬀerences both in the goal and the methodology:
While they use probabilistic reasoning to identify the scanners that provide the
necessary reconnaissance for attacks, we use machine learning techniques to link
attacks to the originating booters. Moreover, both approaches serve diﬀerent
demands: while their work aids in adding pressure on providers to cease illegal

activities, our paper helps to generate forensic evidence that a particular booter
has caused a speciﬁc attack, which can prove useful in prosecution.
9 Conclusion
Our work presented the ﬁrst deep exploration of techniques for attributing ampli-
ﬁcation DDoS attacks to booter services. We present two precise attribution
techniques based on carefully chosen features as part of a k-NN classiﬁer. In
order to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of our techniques, we subscribed to a small
set of booter services and launched self-attacks to collect a ground truth set
of attack-to-booter-service mappings. We discuss the ethical framework used to
collect this data set, which is similar to that of a previous study [7].
Our honeypot-driven technique attributes DNS and NTP attacks with a very
high precision of over 99% while still achieving recall of over 69.35% in the most
challenging real-time attribution scenario. Further analysis has revealed that
25.53% (49,297) of the observed DNS attacks can be attributed to just 7 booter
services and 13.34% (38,520) of the NTP attacks can be attributed to 15 booter
services. We have shared these ﬁndings with law enforcement agencies to help
them prioritize legal actions against the wealth of booter services.
Our second technique extracts features out of a victim’s network’s traces and
attributes attacks from the victim’s perspective, which opens the possibility to
oﬀer a centralized DDoS attribution service. Using this technique, victims can
learn the source of the attacks they face and could even compare two attacks to
determine if they have been launched by the same actor (booter).
