User: Use Python to implement an automation script based on REST API for controlling network devices.
Assistant: First, you need to install the requests library in Python, which can be used to send HTTP requests to the REST API. Next, we can implement an automation script based on REST API through the following steps. 1. Import the requests library: ```python import requests ``` 2. Define the URL of the API interface: ```python url = "http://api.example.com/devices" ``` 3. Define the request header : ```python headers = { "Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer some_token" } ``` 4. Define request parameters: ```python data = { "name": " switch1", "ip_address": "192.168.1.1", "username": "admin", "password": "password" } ``` 5. Send a POST request to create a device: ```python response = requests. post(url, headers=headers, json=data) if response.status_code == 201: print("Device created successfully") else: print("Device created failed") ``` 6. Send a GET request to get the list of devices : ```python response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) if response.status_code == 200: devices = response.json() for device in devices: print(device) else: print("Failed to get device list ") ``` 7. Send PUT request to update device information: ```python new_data = { "ip_address": "192.168.1.2" } update_url = "{}/{}".format(url, devices[0] ["id"]) response = requests.put(update_url, headers=headers, json=new_data) if response.status_code == 200: print("Device update succeeded") else: print("Device update failed") `` ` 8. Send a DELETE request to delete the device: ```python delete_url = "{}/{}".format(url, devices[0]["id"]) response = requests.delete(delete_url, headers=headers) if response.status_code == 204: print("Device deleted successfully") else: print("Device deleted failed") ``` Through the above steps, we can implement an automated script based on REST API to control network devices . You can modify request parameters and request headers according to specific scenarios.
