#### Setting Up the Environment

To self-study this course, follow these steps:

1. **Install a Virtualization System:**
   - We recommend using VirtualBox version 5.1 or later.

2. **Download and Import the Virtual Machine (VM):**
   - Download the VM from [this link](https://edu.postgrespro.com/2dINTRO-student.ova).
   - Import the downloaded OVA file into your virtualization system.

3. **System Requirements:**
   - The VM is configured with Xubuntu 16.04 32-bit.
   - Ensure you have at least 1 GB of free RAM available.

4. **Logging In:**
   - Log in to the operating system as `student`.
   - The pre-installed PostgreSQL server runs under the `postgres` user.
   - The password for all users is the same as their usernames.

5. **Accessing Documentation:**
   - The Firefox browser in the VM is set up to open local PostgreSQL documentation.
   - An internet connection is not required to study the course.

6. **File Management:**
   - You can use command-line tools such as `ls`, `pwd`, and `cd`, or graphical file managers like `mc` and `thunar`.
   - Pre-installed text editors include `vim`, `nano`, `gedit`, and `mousepad`.

#### Course Materials

**Download Location:**
- The course materials are available at [this link](https://edu.postgrespro.com/2dINTRO-handouts-en.zip).

**Downloading the Materials:**
- Click on the «Get 2-Day INTRO handouts» icon on the desktop.
- Alternatively, run the `get_handouts.sh` script located in the home directory of the `student` user.
- All materials will be downloaded into the `pgcourse` directory.

**Provided Materials:**

- **Presentations (PDF Format):**
  - Files are named `NN_theme.pdf`.
  - Each presentation includes both slides and notes.
  - Notes may contain explanations and links to relevant sections of the documentation.

- **Demonstrations (HTML Format):**
  - Files are named `NN_theme.html`.
  - Demonstrations are recorded in HTML format for your convenience.
  - We recommend that you not only review the demonstrations but also practice entering the commands in the terminal yourself.

- **Solutions to Practices (HTML Format):**
  - Files are named `NN_theme_lab.html`.
  - Attempt to solve the practices on your own first, then compare your solutions with the provided ones.

**Command Notations:**

- **`student$`**
  - A prompt ending with a dollar sign indicates a shell command.
  - Run the command as the `student` user.

- **`postgres$`**
  - To execute a command as the `postgres` user, use:
    ```sh
    sudo -u postgres <command>
    ```
  - Alternatively, open another terminal session and run:
    ```sh
    sudo su postgres
    ```
  - Subsequent commands in this terminal will be executed as the `postgres` user.

- **`α=>`**
  - This arrow-like prompt denotes a `psql` command.
  - If `psql` is not already open, run:
    ```sh
    psql
    ```
  - You will connect to the `alpha` server, which is used in most cases.

- **`β=>`**
  - To connect to the `beta` server, run:
    ```sh
    psql -p 5433
    ```

#### Instructions for Self-Study

1. **Study Sequence:**
   - Work through the course material topic by topic.

2. **Video Recordings:**
   - Video recordings of the course will be available at [this link](https://postgrespro.com/education/courses/2dINTRO).

3. **Using the Materials:**
   - The course materials can be used independently or in conjunction with the video recordings.
   - Notes in the slides provide sufficient information to understand the topics.
   - Each topic typically includes a demonstration. When you encounter a "Demonstration" slide, switch to the HTML recording and try to reproduce the scenario.

4. **Practices:**
   - Practices are an essential part of the course.
   - Always attempt to solve the tasks on your own before reviewing the provided solutions.
   - The solutions may contain additional information not covered in the presentations and demonstrations.

We wish you success in mastering the course!
