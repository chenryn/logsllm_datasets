2-Day Introduction to PostgreSQL 11
Student Guide
Setting Up the Environment
To self study the course, first install a virtualization system (we recommend VirtualBox 5.1+). Then
download and import the virtual machine (VM) from https://edu.postgrespro.com/2dINTRO-
student.ova.
The VM contains Xubuntu 16.04 32-bit operating system, preconfigured for the course. You will
need 1 GB of free RAM.
Log in into the OS as student. Preinstalled PostgreSQL server runs under postgres. Passwords of all
users are the same as usernames.
Firefox browser in the VM opens local PostgreSQL documentation. You will not need an internet
connection to study the course.
To manage the files you can use command line (ls, pwd, cd, …) as well as graphical file managers
(mc, thunar). The following text editors are preinstalled: vim, nano, gedit, mousepad.
Course Materials
The course materials are located at https://edu.postgrespro.com/2dINTRO-handouts-en.zip.
To download the materials into the VM, click «Get 2-Day INTRO handouts» icon on the desktop or
run get_handouts.sh script in the home catalog of student user. All the materials will be downloaded
into pgcourse catalog.
The following materials are provided:
• Presentations in PDF (NN_theme.pdf).
You will find both slides and notes on the pages of this document. Notes may contain
explanations and other useful information, such as links to the appropriate sections of the
documentation.
• Demonstrations (NN_theme.html).
During the offline course demonstrations are shown in real time in the terminal. For your
convenience you will find the same demonstrations recorded in html format. The
demonstrations allow you to see the database in action rather than in theory. We recommend you
not only look through the demonstrations, but also enter the commands by yourself in the
terminal. Do not hesitate to experiment.
• Solutions to practices (NN_theme_lab.html).
We recommend first to try to solve the practices by yourself, and then compare your attempt to
the solution provided.
In the demonstrations and solutions all commands start with a prompt. We use the following
notations:
• student$
A prompt ended with the dollar sign denotes a shell command. Run this command on behalf of
the specified user. «Student$» implies that the command should be executed on behalf of
student.
• postgres$
To execute the command on behalf of postgres, run:
sudo -u postgres command
Usually it is convenient to open another terminal session and to execute once:
sudo su postgres
After that all subsequent commands in this terminal will be run on behalf of postgres.
• α=>
Arrow-like prompt denotes a psql command.
Unless psql is already open, run psql command on behalf of student. You will connect to the
alpha server, which is used in the most cases.
• β=>
To connect to the beta server, run psql -p 5433 command on behalf of student.
Instructions to Self Study
Work on the course consequentially, topic by topic.
Video recordings of the course will eventually be available at
https://postgrespro.com/education/courses/2dINTRO.
The course materials can be used both independently and in addition to the video. Notes to the
slides contain enough information to gain an understanding of the subject. As a rule, each topic
contains a demonstration. When encounter a «Demonstration» slide, switch to the html recording of
the demonstration and try to reproduce by yourself the scenario provided.
Practices constitute an important part of the course. Always try to solve the tasks by yourself. After
that we recommend you to look through the provided solutions as they may contain some additional
information not covered in presentations and demonstrations.
We wish you success in mastering the course!
We'll be grateful to receive you comments about the course at edu@postgrespro.ru.
