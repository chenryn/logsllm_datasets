Table III
also include guessing curves for two distributions from
non-password-based authentication schemes: a distribution
of four-digit unlock codes used for an iPhone application
leaked in 2011 [33] and the distribution of surnames (the
most common category of answer to personal knowledge
questions) from a large-scale crawl of Facebook [34]. Within
our plot we add estimated data points from cracking experi-
ments. We include both the password-cracking experiments
discussed in Section II-A and cracking attempts on two
graphical schemes: a 2004 study of user choice in a face-
based graphical PIN scheme [47] and a 2005 study of user-
selected image points in the PassPoints scheme [48]. Note
that due to our use of published cracking results, we are
restricted to using ˜µα instead of ˜Gα.
The guessing curve shows how close the distribution of
passwords at both Yahoo! and RockYou are compared to
other authentication schemes. Both password distributions
have a much sharper increase for very low success-rate
attackers than the surname or PIN distributions do, meaning
passwords are particularly vulnerable to a trawling attacker
who only makes a few attempts at a large number of
accounts. However, passwords have comparatively high α-
work-factor against brute-force attackers. The 1990 cracking
study by Klein provided estimates very close to the optimal
attack for our observed data, suggesting that passwords have
changed only marginally since then.
B. Comparing subpopulations
Of the 328 subpopulations for which we compiled sepa-
rate distributions, we summarize the most interesting which
gathered a sufﬁcient number of samples in Table IV. All of
our sub-distributions had similar guessing metrics: the range
of H∞ was 5.0–9.1 bits and for ˜λ10 from 7.5–10.9 bits, just
over one decimal order of magnitude in variation. Variation
in ˜G0.5 was substantially larger, with the weakest population
having an estimated 17.0 bits and the strongest 26.6 (nearly
three decimal orders of magnitude).
Thus, while there is no “good” population of users which
isn’t generally vulnerable to guessing attacks, there is still
variation which is strongly detectable within the limits of our
sampling conﬁdence: our estimates of H∞ and ˜λ10 are all
accurate to within at least 0.1 bit based on our calculations
in Section V-A, while our extrapolation of ˜Gα allows us to
identify many groups which are statistically different from
the overall population as discussed in Section V-C.
Demographically, users’ reported gender had a small but

split effect, with male-chosen passwords being slightly more
vulnerable to online attack and slightly stronger against of-
ﬂine attack. There is a general trend towards better password
selection with users’ age, particularly against online attacks,
where password strength increases smoothly across different
age groups by about a bit between the youngest users and
the oldest users. Far more substantial were the effects of
language: passwords chosen by Indonesian-speaking users
were amongst the weakest subpopulations identiﬁed with
H∞ = 5.5. In contrast, German and Korean-speaking users
provided relatively strong passwords.
Users’ account history also illustrates several interesting
trends. There is a clear trend towards stronger passwords
amongst users who actively change their password, with
users who have changed passwords 5 or more times being
one of the strongest groups.18 There is a weaker trend
towards stronger passwords amongst users who have com-
pleted an email-based password recovery. However, users
who have had their password reset manually after reporting
their account compromised do not choose better passwords
18As these password changes were voluntary, this trend doesn’t relate
mandatory password change policies, particularly as many users choose
predictably related passwords when forced [49].
than average users.19 Users who log in infrequently, judging
by the time of previous login before observation in our ex-
periment, choose slightly better passwords. A much stronger
trend is that users who have recently logged in from multiple
locations choose relatively strong passwords.20
There is a weak trend towards improvement over time,
with more recent accounts having slightly stronger pass-
words. Of particular interest to the security usability research
community, however, a change in the default login form
at Yahoo! appears to have had little effect. While Yahoo!
has employed many slightly different login forms across its
different services, we can compare users who initially en-
rolled using each of two standard forms: one of which has no
minimum length requirement and no guidance on password
selection, and the other with a 6 character minimum and a
graphical indicator of password strength. This change made
almost no difference in security against online guessing, and
increased the ofﬂine metrics by only 1 bit.
Finally, we can observe variation between users who have
19A tempting interpretation is that user choice in passwords does not
play a signiﬁcant role in the risk of account compromise, though this is not
clearly supported since we can only observe the post-compromise strength.
20Yahoo! maintains a list of recent login locations for each user for abuse
detection purposes.
