It seems like you are encountering issues with `easy_install` and `pip` while trying to install `pytmx`. Let's go through the steps to ensure that everything is set up correctly. 

### Step 1: Verify Python Installation
You mentioned that you have Python 2.7.9 installed, which includes `pip` by default. First, let's verify your Python installation:

1. Open Command Prompt (CMD).
2. Type `python --version` and press Enter.
   - You should see `Python 2.7.9` or a similar version number.

### Step 2: Verify `pip` Installation
Next, let's check if `pip` is installed and working:

1. In the same Command Prompt, type `pip --version` and press Enter.
   - If `pip` is installed, it will display the version number.
   - If `pip` is not recognized, you may need to add it to your system path.

### Step 3: Add `pip` to System Path
If `pip` is not recognized, you need to add it to your system path. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Locate the `Scripts` directory in your Python installation. It should be something like `C:\Python27\Scripts`.
2. Open the System Properties:
   - Right-click on `Computer` or `This PC` on the desktop or in File Explorer.
   - Select `Properties`.
   - Click on `Advanced system settings`.
   - Click on the `Environment Variables` button.
3. In the `System variables` section, find the `Path` variable and select it.
4. Click `Edit` and add the path to the `Scripts` directory at the end of the `Variable value`, separated by a semicolon (`;`):
   - For example: `...;C:\Python27\Scripts`
5. Click `OK` to close all dialog boxes.

### Step 4: Install `pytmx` Using `pip`
Once `pip` is recognized, you can install `pytmx`:

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```sh
   pip install pytmx
   ```

### Additional Tips
- Ensure that there are no typos in your environment variables.
- If you still encounter issues, you might want to reinstall Python 2.7.9 and make sure to check the option to add Python to the system PATH during installation.

### Summary
- Verify Python and `pip` installations.
- Add the `Scripts` directory to the system path.
- Use `pip` to install `pytmx`.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to install `pytmx` without any issues. If you still face problems, please provide more details about the error messages you are seeing.
