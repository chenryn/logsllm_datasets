When you visit the Bootstrap documentation with a window to small for the docs
to show the sidebar on the left, then resize your browser so it does appear,
the sidebar will stay at the top of the page, and doesn't scroll down with
you. Neither will it mark at which section you are.
I can confirm this issue in Internet Explorer 11, Firefox 30 and Chrome 35.
