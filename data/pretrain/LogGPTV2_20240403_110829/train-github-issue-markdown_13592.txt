When viewing the Bootstrap documentation on a screen that is too small to display the sidebar, and then resizing the browser window to make the sidebar visible, you may encounter an issue where the sidebar remains fixed at the top of the page. As a result, it does not scroll down with the content, nor does it indicate which section of the documentation you are currently viewing.

I have confirmed this issue in the following browsers:
- Internet Explorer 11
- Firefox 30
- Chrome 35

This behavior can be inconvenient for users who rely on the sidebar for navigation and context within the documentation.
