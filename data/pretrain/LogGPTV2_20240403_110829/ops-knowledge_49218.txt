User: Explain what containerization technology is and provide application scenarios.
Assistant: Containerization is a lightweight virtualization technology that packages together an application and its dependencies into a portable container. Each container has its own file system, network and process space, and can run independently in any environment without interfering with the operation of other containers. Application scenarios of containerization technology mainly include: 1. Application deployment: containerization technology can quickly deploy, update and expand applications, improving deployment efficiency and reliability. 2. Environmental isolation: containerization technology can provide environmental isolation, avoid mutual influence between applications, and ensure the reliability and stability of applications. 3. Resource Utilization: Containerization technology can help improve the resource utilization of the server because containers are lightweight and can run multiple application instances on the same server. 4. Development environment construction: Containerization technology can help developers quickly build a development environment, avoiding dependency conflicts and configuration problems. 5. Multi-cloud deployment: Containerization technology can help seamlessly migrate applications between different cloud platforms to achieve multi-cloud deployment.
