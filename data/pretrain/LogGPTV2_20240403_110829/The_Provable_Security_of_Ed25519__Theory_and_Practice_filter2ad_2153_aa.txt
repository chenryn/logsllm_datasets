**Abstract:**
A fundamental requirement for a digital signature scheme is existential unforgeability under chosen message attacks (EUF-CMA), along with other desirable properties such as strong unforgeability (SUF-CMA) and resilience against key substitution attacks. Despite its widespread use and efficiency, no detailed security proofs have been provided for EdDSA, particularly for its Ed25519 instantiation. Ed25519 is extensively used in protocols like TLS 1.3, SSH, Tor, ZCash, and WhatsApp/Signal. The subtle differences between various Ed25519 implementations are often supported by informal arguments, and many security proofs assume that Ed25519 satisfies EUF-CMA or SUF-CMA.

In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis and security proofs for Ed25519 signature schemes. Although the design follows the well-established Fiat-Shamir paradigm, which should ensure existential unforgeability, the presence of side cases and encoding details complicates the proofs. Our work provides a scientific basis for choosing among different Ed25519 variants, fills a critical gap in modern protocol security proofs, and supports ongoing standardization efforts.

## I. Introduction

Ed25519, introduced in 2011 by Bernstein, Duif, Lange, Schwabe, and Yang, is a highly efficient and widely adopted digital signature scheme. Its use spans across various modern applications, including TLS 1.3, SSH, Tor, ZCash, and messaging protocols based on the Signal protocol, such as WhatsApp.

For modern digital signature schemes, the essential property is existential unforgeability under chosen message attacks (EUF-CMA). This property ensures that an adversary cannot generate a valid signature for a message not previously signed by the key owner. A stronger property, strong unforgeability under chosen message attacks (SUF-CMA), additionally requires that an adversary cannot produce an alternative valid signature for a given signed message. The absence of SUF-CMA can lead to vulnerabilities, such as the Mt. Gox attack on Bitcoin, where malleable signatures were exploited to double-spend transactions.

Additionally, resistance to key substitution attacks is crucial in many practical systems. In these attacks, an adversary computes specific public keys that allow honest signatures to be verified under the adversary's new public keys, leading to potential security breaches in protocols like Let’s Encrypt Certificate Issuance and SOAP’s WS-Security.

Surprisingly, no full proofs of these security properties have been provided for Ed25519. The original publications [1], [6] focused on computational efficiency and did not include precise security statements. While the scheme is constructed using the Fiat-Shamir transform, which should imply EUF-CMA security, the details were never fully elaborated. The papers also discussed malleability but defined it differently from common usage. The source code accompanying the paper accepts mangled signatures, making it non-SUF-CMA, while an additional check in the paper's description, though not in the code, could have ensured SUF-CMA security.

Subsequent implementations, such as Ed25519-IETF, standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), included checks to prevent malleability, suggesting SUF-CMA security. Other versions, like those used by LibSodium and ZCash, added further group element checks. These variations raise the question: which exact security properties do the various Ed25519 schemes provide? This is especially relevant as Ed25519 is proposed for inclusion in the USA’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard for Digital Signature Schemes and was recently included in the TLS 1.3 standard.

Several published works have assumed specific cryptographic properties for Ed25519, such as EUF-CMA for TLS 1.3 [14]–[17] and SUF-CMA for SSH [18]. However, these assumptions leave proof gaps, and some claims, such as the one in [19] about Schnorr signatures implying SUF-CMA for Ed25519-Original, are incorrect.

In this work, we address these proof gaps and establish the security properties of Ed25519 schemes. We provide the first detailed proofs that Ed25519-Original is EUF-CMA secure and that Ed25519-IETF is SUF-CMA secure. We also show that all Ed25519 schemes are resilient to key substitution attacks if small subgroup keys are rejected. Our results support the standardization of Ed25519-IETF and ongoing NIST standardization efforts.

### A. History of EdDSA and Ed25519

Ed25519 is an instantiation of the more general EdDSA signature scheme, introduced in the same 2011 paper [1], [6]. EdDSA is a variant of the well-known Schnorr signature scheme [20], [21]. Ed25519, instantiated over the Edwards25519 curve, remains the most popular EdDSA instantiation, despite later extensions to support alternative curves [7], [22].

Ed25519 offers substantial speed and efficiency advantages over other signature schemes at similar security levels. It produces 64-byte signatures and 32-byte public keys, providing better resistance to side-channel attacks. However, the original papers [1], [6] did not include formal security statements or proofs.

Due to its outstanding performance, EdDSA was standardized by the IETF between 2015 and 2017 [7]. In 2019, it was proposed for adoption as part of NIST’s Digital Signature Standard (DSS) [10], [11]. As of early 2020, the public call for comments was closed, but no new version has appeared yet.

### B. Related Proofs

The Fiat-Shamir paradigm, proposed by Fiat and Shamir [23], is a generic method to derive a secure signature scheme from a canonical identification scheme (CID). Extensive work followed this seminal result, with Schnorr signatures [20], [21] being a prominent example. The original presentation [23] lacked security proofs, but Pointcheval and Stern [24], [25] provided proofs in the random oracle model, which is now widely accepted.
