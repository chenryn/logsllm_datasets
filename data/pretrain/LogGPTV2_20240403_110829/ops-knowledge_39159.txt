User: I am using cx_freeze to compile my python script and when I compile the program, all the files are placed in one specified folder. The executable wont run if the shared libs are not within the same directory.
How would I set it up so the executable looks within /usr/lib/PROGRAMNAME/ to run the libraries?
Assistant: bbfreeze will put everything in a single executable.
