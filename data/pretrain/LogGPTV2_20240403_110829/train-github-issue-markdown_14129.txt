The following line of code:

```julia
n = 512; L = rand(n, n); z = rand(n); b = L \ z;
```

executes successfully in the REPL and IJulia with Julia version 1.6.3. However, when using IJulia with Julia version 1.6.4, I encounter a `StackOverflowError`. This issue has also been reported by other users in environments such as VSCode and Juno, while running on macOS Monterey.

For more information, please refer to the discussion thread on the Julia Discourse forum:  
[Downgrade to 1.6.3](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/downgrade-to-1-6-3/72129/2)
