Abstract
The popularity of cloud hosting services also brings in new security
challenges:
it has been reported that these services are increas-
ingly utilized by miscreants for their malicious online activities.
Mitigating this emerging threat, posed by such “bad repositories”
(simply Bar), is challenging due to the different hosting strategy
to traditional hosting service, the lack of direct observations of the
repositories by those outside the cloud, the reluctance of the cloud
provider to scan its customers’ repositories without their consent,
and the unique evasion strategies employed by the adversary. In this
paper, we took the ﬁrst step toward understanding and detecting this
emerging threat. Using a small set of “seeds” (i.e., conﬁrmed Bars),
we identiﬁed a set of collective features from the websites they
serve (e.g., attempts to hide Bars), which uniquely characterize the
Bars. These features were utilized to build a scanner that detected
over 600 Bars on leading cloud platforms like Amazon, Google,
and 150K sites, including popular ones like groupon.com, using
them. Highlights of our study include the pivotal roles played by
these repositories on malicious infrastructures and other important
discoveries include how the adversary exploited legitimate cloud
repositories and why the adversary uses Bars in the ﬁrst place that
has never been reported. These ﬁndings bring such malicious ser-
vices to the spotlight and contribute to a better understanding and
ultimately eliminating this new threat.

INTRODUCTION
Cloud hosting service today is serving over a billion users world-
wide, providing them stable, low-cost, reliable, high-speed and
globally available resource access. For example, Amazon Simple
Storage Service (S3) is reported to store over 2 trillion objects for
web and image hosting, system backup, etc. In addition to storing
data, these services are moving toward a more active role in sup-
porting their customers’ computing missions, through sharing the
repositories (a.k.a. bucket for Google Cloud [?]) hosting various
dynamic content and programming tools. A prominent example
is Google’s Hosted Libraries [?], a content distribution network
(CDN) for disseminating the most popular, open-source JavaScript
resources, which web developers can easily incorporate into their

websites through a simple code snippet. In addition to benign users,
the popularity of these services has also attracted cybercriminals.
Compared with dedicated underground hosting services, reposito-
ries on legitimate commercial clouds are more reliable and harder
to blacklist. They are also much cheaper: for example, it is reported
that 15 GB on the dark net is sold at $15 per month [?], which
is actually offered for free by Google to every Google Driver user.
Indeed, it has been reported [?] that malware distributors are increas-
ingly using the commercial clouds to process and deploy malicious
content.
Understanding bad cloud repositories: challenges. Although
there have been indications of cloud hosting misuse, understand-
ing how such services are abused is challenging. For the service
providers, who are bound by their privacy commitments and ethical
concerns, they tend to avoid inspecting the content of their cus-
tomers’ repositories in the absence of proper consent. Even when
the providers are willing to do so, determining whether a repository
involves malicious content is by no means trivial: nuts and bolts
for malicious activities could appear perfectly innocent before they
are assembled into an attack machine; examples include image ﬁles
for Spam and Phishing as shown in Figure 1. Actually, even for
the repository conﬁrmed to serve malicious content like malware,
today’s cloud providers tend to only remove that speciﬁc content,
instead of terminating the whole account, to avoid collateral damage
(e.g., compromised legitimate repositories). Exploring the issue
becomes even more difﬁcult for the third party, who does not have
the ability to directly observe the repositories and can only access
them through the websites or sources that utilize the storage ser-
vices. Further adding to the complexity of ﬁnding such a repository
is the diverse roles it may play in attack infrastructures (e.g., serving
malware for one attack and serving Phishing content for another),
due to the mixed content a single repository may host: e.g., malware
together with Phishing images. As a result, existing techniques
(e.g., those for detecting dedicated malicious services [?][?]) cannot
be directly applied to capture the repository, simply because their
original targets often contain more homogeneous content (e.g., just
malware) and contribute to different campaigns in the same way. So
far, little has been done to understand the scope and magnitude of
malicious or compromised repositories on legitimate clouds (called
Bad Repository or simply Bar in our research) and the technical
details about their services to the adversary, not to mention any
effort to mitigate the threat they pose.
Finding “Bars” online. In this paper, we present the ﬁrst system-
atic study on the abuses of cloud repositories on the legitimate cloud
platforms as a malicious service, which was found to be highly
pervasive, acting as a backbone for large-scale malicious web cam-
paigns (Section 4). Our study was bootstrapped by a set of “seeds”:
100 conﬁrmed malicious or compromised buckets [?], each of which

tom of a webpage as an update notiﬁcation to lure visitors to download
malware.
is a cloud resource repository with stored objects (often of different
types) organized under a unique identiﬁcation key. These buck-
ets were collected from Spam messages or the malicious URLs
cached by a popular malware scanner. Comparing them with those
known to be legitimate, we found that despite various roles each
bucket plays in different types of attacks (due to the diversity in
the content it serves), still the websites connecting to those buckets
exhibit prominent common features (see Section 3.1), particularly,
the presence of “gatekeeper” sites that cover the Bars (a valuable
asset for the adversary) and remarkably homogeneous redirection
behavior (i.e., fetching repository resources indirectly through other
sites’ references) and sometimes similar content organizations, due
to the same attack payload the compromised sites upload from their
backend (i.e., the Bars), or the templates the bucket provides to the
adversary for quick deployment of her attack sites. By comparison,
a legitimate bucket (e.g., reputable jQuery repository) tends to be
directly accessed by the websites with highly diverse content.
Based on this observation, we developed BarFinder, a scanner
that automatically detects Bars through inspecting the topological
relations between websites and the cloud bucket they use, in an
attempt to capture Bars based on the external features of the web-
sites they serve. More speciﬁcally, for all the sites connecting to
a repository, our approach correlates the domains and URLs (par-
ticular those related to cloud repositories) across their redirection
chains and content features across their DOM structures to identify
the presence of gatekeepers and evading behavior, and also measure
the diversity of their content organization. A set of new collective
features generated in this way, including bucket usage similarity,
connection ratio, landing similarity and others (Section 3.1), are fur-
ther utilized by a classiﬁer to ﬁnd out suspicious buckets. Running
the scanner over all the data collected by the Common Crawl [?],
which indexed ﬁve billion web pages, for those associated with all
major cloud storage providers (including Amazon S3, Cloudfront,
Google Drive, etc.), we found around 1 million sites utilizing 6,885
repositories hosted on these clouds. Among them, BarFinder identi-
ﬁed 694 malicious or compromised repositories, involving millions
of ﬁles, with a precision of 95% and a coverage of 90% against our
ground-truth set.
Our discoveries. Looking into the Bars identiﬁed by our scanner,
we are surprised by the scope and the magnitude of the threat. These
buckets are hosted by the most reputable cloud service providers.
For example, 13.7% of Amazon S3 repositories and 5.5% of Google
repositories that we inspected turned out to be either compromised
or completely malicious1. Among those compromised are popular
cloud repositories such as Groupon’s ofﬁcial bucket. Altogether,
472 such legitimate repositories were considered to be contaminated,
due to a misconﬁguration ﬂaw never reported before, which allows
arbitrary content to be uploaded and existing data to be modiﬁed
without proper authorization. The impact of these Bars is signiﬁcant,
infecting 1,306 legitimate websites, including Alexa top 300 sites
like groupon.com, Alexa top 5,000 sites like space.com, etc. We
reported our ﬁndings to Amazon and leading organizations affected
by the infections. Groupon has already conﬁrmed the compromise
we discovered and awarded us for our help.
1We have manually examined and conﬁrmed all those instances.
When it comes to malicious buckets, our study brings to light
new insights into this new wave of repository based cyber-attacks,
including the importance of Bars to malicious web activities and
the challenges in defending against this new threat. More speciﬁ-
cally, we found that on average, one Bar serves 152 malicious or
compromised sites. In one of the large campaigns discovered in our
research, the Bar cloudfront_ﬁle.enjin.com hosts a malicious script
that was injected into at least 1,020 websites (Section 4.1). These
Bars sit right at the center of the attack infrastructure, supporting and
coordinating other malicious actors’ operations at different stages of
a campaign. Interestingly, we found that they could be strategically
placed on different cloud platforms, making them hard to block (due
to the popularity of their hosting clouds like Google) and detect
(scattered across different providers), and easy to share across multi-
ple campaigns. As an example, the Potentially Unwanted Programs
(PUP) campaign we found ﬁrst loads a redirection script from a
Bar on Akamaihd (the world’s largest CDN platform) to lead the
victim to the attack website, then fetches Phishing pictures from an
Amazon S3 Bar, and ﬁnally delivers the malware stored on Cloud-
front to the target systems (Section 4.4). In the presence of such
meticulously planned attacks, the cloud service providers apparently
are inadequately prepared, possibly due to the privacy constraints
in touching their customers’ repositories. We found that many Bars
remain active during our study, and survive a much longer lifetime
than that of the malicious content hosted on websites (Section 4.3).
Further complicating the mission of Bar identiﬁcation are other eva-
sion techniques the adversary employs, including code obfuscation
and use of a redirection chain and cloaking techniques to avoid
exposing malicious payloads to a malware scanner.
Contributions. The contributions of the paper are as follows:
• New understanding. We performed the ﬁrst systematic study on
cloud repositories as a malicious service, an emerging security threat.
For the ﬁrst time, our study reveals the scope and magnitude of the
threat and its signiﬁcant impact, particularly on the infrastructures
of illicit web activities. These ﬁndings bring to the spotlight this im-
portant yet understudied problem and lead to a better understanding
of the techniques the adversary employs and their weaknesses. This
will contribute to better defense against and ultimate elimination of
the threat.
• New technique. Based on our understanding of bad cloud repos-
itories, we take a ﬁrst step toward automatically detecting them.
The technique we developed relies on the topological relationship
between a cloud repository and the websites it serves, which are dif-
ﬁcult to change and effective at capturing malicious or compromised
buckets. Our evaluation over a large number of popular websites
demonstrates the potential of the technique, which could be utilized
by both cloud providers and third parties to identify the threats posed
by Bars.

research; Section 3 describes our ﬁndings from the ground-truth
dataset and the design and implementation of BarFinder; Section 4

surement study; Section 5 discusses the limitations of our work and
possible future research; Section 6 compares our work with related
prior research and Section 7 concludes the paper.
2. BACKGROUND
Cloud hosting. Cloud hosting is a type of infrastructure as a service
(IaaS), which is rented by the cloud user to host her web assets (e.g.,
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and image ﬁles). These web assets are orga-
nized into cloud repositories referred to as buckets which are identi-
1542malware, click-hijacking and others. These buckets are connected
to front-end websites, which could be malicious, compromised or
legitimate ones contaminated only by the Bar.
3. FINDING BARS ONLINE
In this section, we elaborate on our analysis of a set of known
Bars (the seed set) and the features identiﬁed for differentiating
benign repositories and Bars. These features are utilized in our
research to build a simple web scanner, BarFinder, for detecting
other malicious or compromised high-proﬁle, previously-unknown
repositories and the malicious campaigns in which they serve.
3.1 Features of Bad Repositories
Our study is based on a small set of conﬁrmed good and bad
repositories and their related domains, which we analyzed to ﬁnd
out how Bars (bad repositories) differ from legitimate repositories.
In the absence of direct access to these buckets, good or bad, all
we can do is to infer their legitimacy from who use them and how
they are used (by different domains), that is, the features of the
domains and their interactivities on the redirection paths leading
to the cloud repository. Of particular interest here are a set of
collective properties identiﬁed from the resource fetching chains
(a.k.a., redirection chains) for serving the content of Bars, which is
hard to change by the adversary, compared with the content features
of individual Bars. Below, we elaborate on the way such data was
collected and the salient features discovered in our research, which
describe how the adversary attempts to hide Bars or use them to
cover other attack assets, a redirection pattern never observed on
legitimate repositories.
Data collection. To build the seed set, we collected a set of con-
ﬁrmed malicious or compromised buckets (called Badset) and legiti-
mate buckets (called Goodset) as well as their related domains, as
illustrated in Table 1.
• Badset. We utilized two feeds as the ground truth for gathering
bad cloud buckets: the Spamtrap feed and the CleanMX feed [?].
The former comes from a Spam honeypot we constructed [?] that
receives around 10K Spam emails per day, from which cloud URLs
promoted by the emails were extracted which may include spam
resources such as HTML, images, and scripts. The latter includes
the historical data of CleanMX, a popular domain scanning engine,
from which cloud-related URLs were collected. For both feeds, we
further validate them by VirusTotal [?] and manual inspections (e.g.,
looking for Phishing content) to ensure that they were indeed bad
(to avoid contaminating the dataset with legitimate buckets used
in malicious activities). Using the collected set of malicious cloud
URLs from both feeds, we extracted their repositories, which led to
100 conﬁrmed Bars.
• Goodset. The good buckets were gathered from the Alexa top
3K websites, which are considered to be mostly clean. To this end,
we visited each website using a crawler (as a Firefox add-on) to
record the HTTP trafﬁc triggered by the visit, including network
requests, responses, browser events, etc. From the collected trafﬁc,
we extracted the HTTP cloud request URLs corresponding to 300
cloud buckets hosted on 20 leading cloud hosting services like
Amazon S3, Google Drive, etc. (see Appendix Table 7 for the
complete list). Note that even though some of them provide CDN
service or DDOS protection, they are all provided hosting service to
act as cloud repository.
• Bucket-served sites and their HTTP trafﬁc. We collected HTTP
trafﬁc using the crawler mentioned above to visit a list of websites
using buckets for feature extraction. Rather than blindly crawling
the web to ﬁnd those sites, we adopted a more targeted strategy by
Figure 2: Overview of the cloud hosting process.
