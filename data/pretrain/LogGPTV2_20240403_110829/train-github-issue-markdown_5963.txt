I've run into an issue where creating a RectangleSelector prevents
ax.axis('tight') from working properly. I've discovered that when the selector
is created, it creates new line objects near coordinate (0,0) on the plot.
Though not visible, the axis('tight') respects their presence and will not
collapse around the real data. This matters if the real data is far from the
origin. This seems like a bug?
I could work around it if I could figure out how to set the initial location
of the RS line objects.
