# Feature request
I'm writing a Next app on Windows and deploying it on Elastic Beanstalk. The
deployment process involves running `next build` locally and then deploying
the necessary files along with the `.next` folder to Elastic Beanstalk.
However, this isn't possible since the files in the `.next` build folder use
os-specific directory separators, making any build from a Windows machine
incompatible with one on a Linux machine.
~~What I'd like to see done is have a configuration option that would allow
you to specify the directory separator used in build files to either the
system default,`/`, or `\`.~~ or preferrably, replace the directory separators
at runtime to support the build in any operating system.
While running `next build` is still an option, I've personally had issues with
permissions doing while building locally works, that is, after manually
changing all the directory separators in the config files in the `.next`
folder.
EDIT: after posting this last night, I thought it over and realized that just
making the changes at runtime when parsing the build folder would be more user
intuitive.
