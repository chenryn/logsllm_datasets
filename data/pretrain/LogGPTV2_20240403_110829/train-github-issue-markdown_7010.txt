# Description of the new feature/enhancement
We can currently select text in the terminal by dragging mouse with key
pressed. Linux terminals and Windows command prompt allows you to select text
by also Shift + arrow keys. I have tried this in the Windows terminal and
instead of selecting the texts it just prints characters (Shift + right arrow
prints 'D' for me).
Would be great to have the keyboard method for text selection for windows
users. Would be very helpful for keyboard heavy users
## Update
I checked that powershell on terminal works as expected  
cmd on terminal doesn't print extra characters, the cursor just moves instead
of selection  
WSL prints extra characters (shift + right => D, Shift + left => C, etc)
