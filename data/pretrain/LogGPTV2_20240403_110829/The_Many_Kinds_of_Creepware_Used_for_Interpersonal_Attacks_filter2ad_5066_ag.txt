### Communication
Thirteen applications offer communication functionalities, such as enhancing WhatsApp with group messaging capabilities, providing free SMS or phone calls, and enabling walkie-talkie features. Many of these apps market themselves as tools for meeting local singles.

### Index
Nine applications are primarily designed to provide indices of items on sale or money-making opportunities. While most focus on online deals, they often indirectly encourage the installation of additional apps.

### Pay Per Install (PPI)
Twenty-seven applications incentivize users to install other apps on their devices, typically by offering payments or free calling services. This allows app developers to artificially boost their app's installation counts and generate fake positive reviews.

### Tutorial - Miscellaneous
Eleven tutorial apps did not fit into a clear category. Some of these apps teach skills useful for hacking but do not explicitly mention hacking (e.g., DOS CMD commands). The seemingly benign ones use the word "hack" in their titles, which may lead to downloads under false expectations.

### Tutorial - Development
Six applications focus on app development, with half of them providing templates that enable non-technical users to create their own apps.

### Spoofing - Miscellaneous
Four spoofing apps do not fit neatly into prominent sub-categories: two enable email spoofing, and two allow spoofing of the device’s MAC address.

### Spoofing - Burner Phone
Forty-one apps provide the ability to place anonymous calls or SMS messages, often marketed for evading call blocking. These can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, such as surveillance. Some apps are overtly designed for child safety or business use, but many are intended for covert tracking.

### Surveillance - Microphone
Eleven apps record the device’s microphone, often to remotely activate the microphone on a victim’s device. Four of these apps, like "Ear Agent: Super Hearing," enhance hearing, though they are often marketed for people with hearing disabilities and can be used for spying.

### Surveillance - Screen
Five apps allow the device’s screen to be recorded, streamed, or snapshotted, serving as their primary function.

### Surveillance - SMS
Nine apps focus exclusively on forwarding or snooping on SMS messages.

### Surveillance - Social Media
One hundred and five apps enable continuous surveillance of social media accounts. The most prevalent are those that allow access to multiple WhatsApp accounts on a single device, which can be used for benign purposes but are also frequently used maliciously. For example, "Clone Whatsweb Pro" prompts users to "Enter WhatsApp Victim’s Device." Another group of apps provides digests of who viewed a user’s social media profile.

### Surveillance - Social Media Covert
Twenty-six apps explicitly market their ability to surveil social media accounts covertly, such as by turning off indicators that abusers are logged into victim accounts and reading their WhatsApp messages.

### Surveillance - Thorough
Ninety apps provide multiple means of surveillance. Descriptions often generically explain the app’s capabilities without referencing illegal use cases, though some have since renamed themselves to comply with app store policies. Suggested uses include anti-theft and parental supervision, but some mention remote control of a device or explicit “Spy,” “Family,” and “GirlFriend” tracking.

### Tutorial - Hacking
Sixty-one apps are hacking tutorials, providing device-hacking advice, tips, news, glossaries, and forums. "Spyboy" is the most popular and is often found on devices with apps that appear to have abusive intent.

### Tutorial - Rooting
Six apps teach users how to root a device or actually perform the rooting. One such app, "Kingo ROOT," is the 4th most prevalent in the top 1,000 and is five times as prevalent as the other five rooting apps combined.

### Tutorial - Settings
Sixteen apps provide guides and tools for changing Android “Secret Codes.” These apps strongly correlate with hacking-focused tutorials.

### Spoofing - Fake Call
Six apps provide the ability to fake incoming calls or call logs, enabling users to spoof both the source phone number and caller ID. They are often marketed as useful for getting out of "sticky situations," but can also be used for abusive purposes.

### Spoofing - HTML
Five apps enable the browser’s rendered content to be altered, including changing the targets of HTML tags, which could be used for phishing attacks.

### Spoofing - Image
Nine apps modify or create false images or videos, including face-swapping tools that can be used for impersonation attacks or revenge porn. Two apps enable sharing images on WhatsApp where the thumbnail differs from the underlying image, and two others generate fake ID card images.

### Spoofing - SMS
Twenty apps mask the true sender of SMS messages. Unlike burner-phone apps, the intent of many SMS spoofing apps is to pose as another individual. Many allow entire chains of text messages to be faked.

### Spoofing - Social Media
We found social media spoofing apps that impersonate senders and construct fake message chains. Seven of the eight apps in this category spoof WhatsApp messages, while the eighth spoofs Facebook Messenger.

### Spoofing - Suppress Caller ID
Four apps allow senders to fake or block caller ID information on the device where the app is installed. Most apps enable selective disabling or spoofing of caller ID on a per-call or per-sender basis.

### Spoofing - Thorough
Eight apps spoof in multiple ways. The most common combine burner-phone functionality with the ability to spoof caller ID and voice. One app bundles fake email and SMS functionality.

### Spoofing - Voice
Ten apps use voice modification to mask identity or make a voice sound scary. While many are playful, they often appear alongside abusive apps.

### Surveillance - Miscellaneous
Surveillance apps were the largest category in our data. While most fit cleanly into sub-categories, four apps did not follow any trend. These include two keyloggers, one app that is a viewer for a keylogger installed on a PC, and one that logs touch input patterns.

### Surveillance - Calls
These apps provide ongoing access to call histories or continual or selective on-demand recordings of phone calls without the victim’s consent. Thirteen of the eighteen apps in this category enable call recording, with all but one claiming the ability to perform covert automated recording of calls. The remaining five provide ongoing access to call logs.

### Surveillance - Camera
Fifteen apps turn on the camera and microphone, typically forwarding a stream to a remote device. About half are marketed for covert use, while others repurpose devices as security cameras or baby monitors, though PMI data suggests many are also used for covert surveillance.

### Surveillance - Location
Ninety apps track location and little else, though location tracking is also offered by most thorough surveillance apps.
