None – Communication: 13 apps provide communica-
tion functionality, such as extending WhatsApp with group
messaging capabilities, providing free SMS or phone calls,
or enabling walkie-talkie functionality. Many of these apps
advertise as ways to meet local singles.
None – Index: The primary purpose of 9 apps is to provide
indices of items on sale or of money-making opportunities.
The former primarily index online deals, though many indi-
rectly encourage the installation of additional apps.
None – Pay Per Install (PPI): 27 apps incentivize users to
install other apps on their devices, primarily by offering pay-
ments or free calling services. App developers that advertise
through PPI apps are able to artiﬁcially increase the installation
counts of their apps and receive fake favorable reviews.
None – Tutorial Misc: 11 tutorial apps did not ﬁt into a
strong trend, including apps that teach skills useful for hacking
but that do not mention hacking explicitly (e.g., DOS CMD
commands). Those that seem most benign use the word “hack”
in their titles, which may have led to their being downloaded
under false expectations.
None – Tutorial Development: 6 apps focus on app de-
velopment, half of which provide the ability for non-technical
users to create their own apps (e.g., by providing templates).
Spooﬁng – Misc: 4 apps that provide spooﬁng functionality
do not ﬁt cleanly into prominent sub-categories of spooﬁng
apps: two that enable email spooﬁng, and two that spoof the
device’s MAC address.
Spoof – Burner Phone: 41 apps provide the ability to
place anonymous calls or SMS messages, with many explicitly
advertising for use in evading call blocking. These apps can be

surveillance apps, making it the most common type of surveil-
lance overall. Some of these apps are not covert and seem to
be for child safety or business use cases, but most of the apps
surfaced by CreepRank explicitly state, or strongly hint, that
they are designed for covert tracking.
Surveillance – Microphone: 11 apps record the device’s
microphone, often to remotely turn on the microphone on a
victim’s device. Four apps use the microphone to enhance
hearing, with titles like “Ear Agent: Super Hearing.” While
many of these apps market themselves for people with hearing
disabilities, most encourage spying.
Surveillance – Screen: 5 apps allow the device’s screen to
be recorded, streamed, or snapshotted as their main purpose.
Surveillance – SMS: 9 apps focus exclusively on forward-
ing or snooping on SMS messages.
Surveillance – Social Media: Fully 105 apps enable con-
tinuous surveillance of social media accounts. Most prevalent
are apps that enable access to multiple WhatsApp accounts
on a single device, which can be used for benign purposes.
However, malicious use of such apps is apparent
in co-
installation data and some of the apps themselves, as with
“Clone Whatsweb Pro” which prompts, “Enter WhatsApp
Victim’s Device.” Another group of apps provides users with
digests of who viewed their social media proﬁle.
Surveillance – Social Media Covert: 26 apps explicitly
market their ability to surveil social media accounts covertly,
such as by turning off indicators that abusers are logged into
victim accounts and reading their WhatsApp messages.
Surveillance – Thorough: 90 apps provide multiple means
of surveillance. App descriptions are often generic explana-
tions of the app’s capabilities without reference to illegal use
cases, though in deference to app store policies or public
pressure, some have since renamed themselves, as in the case
of “GirlFriend Cell Tracker”, which is now known as “Family
Locator for Android.” Suggested uses are most often anti-theft
and parental supervision, but some mention remote control of a
device or explicit “Spy”, “Family”, and “GirlFriend” tracking.
Tutorial – Hacking: 61 apps are hacking tutorials and
provide device-hacking advice,
tips, news, glossaries, and
forums. “Spyboy” is both the most popular and most likely
to be on devices with apps that appear to have abusive intent.
Tutorial – Rooting: 6 apps teach users how to root a device
or actually do so. One such app, the “Kingo ROOT” app, is
the 4th most prevalent app in the top 1,000, and is 5 times as
prevalent as the other 5 rooting apps put together.
Tutorial – Settings: 16 apps provide guides and tools
for changing Android “Secret Codes”. These apps correlate
strongly with hacking-focused tutorials.
used both by abusers who intend to harass and by surveillance
victims seeking to evade surveillance. These apps function as
“burner phones” in that they provide phone numbers that can
be used once and then discarded.
Spoof – Fake Call: 6 apps provide the ability to fake
incoming calls or call logs, enabling users to spoof both the
source phone number and caller-id. Fake incoming calls are
often advertised as useful for getting out of “sticky situations”,
but other abusive purposes can be readily imagined.
Spoof – HTML: 5 apps enable the browser’s rendered
content to be altered, including changing the targets of HTML
tags, which could be used to phish a victim.
Spoof – Image: 9 apps modify or create false images or
videos, including face-swapping tools that can be used for
impersonation attacks or for revenge porn [4]. Two apps enable
images to be shared on WhatsApp for which the thumbnail
provided by the app differs from the underlying image. Two
others generate fake ID card images.
Spoof – SMS: 20 apps mask the true sender of SMS
messages. Unlike burner-phone apps, the intent of many SMS
spooﬁng apps is to pose as another individual. Many allow
entire chains of text messages to be faked.
Spoof – Social Media: We found social media spooﬁng
apps that impersonating senders and construct fake message
chains. 7 of the 8 apps in this category spoof WhatsApp
messages, while the 8th spoofs Facebook Messenger.
Spoof – Suppress Caller ID: 4 apps allow senders to fake
or block caller ID information on the device where the app is
installed. Most apps enable selective disabling or spooﬁng of
caller ID on a per-call or per-sender basis.
Spoof – Thorough: 8 apps spoof in multiple ways. Most
common were apps that combine burner-phone functionality
with the ability to spoof caller-ID and voice spooﬁng. One app
bundles fake email and SMS functionality.
Spoof – Voice: 10 apps use voice modiﬁcation to mask
identity or make a voice sound scary. Many of these are
playful, but they do appear regularly alongside abusive apps.
Surveillance – Misc: Surveillance apps were the largest
category in our data. While most surveillance apps ﬁt cleanly
into sub-categories, four apps were not part of any trend. These
include two key-loggers, one app that is a viewer for keylogger
installed on a PC, and one that logs touch input patterns.
Surveillance – Calls: These apps provide ongoing access to
call histories or continual or selective on-demand recordings of
phone calls without the victim’s consent. 13 of the 18 apps in
this category enable call-recording, with all but one claiming
the ability to perform covert automated recording of calls. The
remaining ﬁve provide ongoing access to call logs.
Surveillance – Camera: 15 apps turn on the camera and
microphone, typically forwarding a stream to a remote device.
Roughly half are marketed for covert use. Others re-purpose
devices as security cameras or baby monitors, although PMI
data suggests that many of these are also used for covert
surveillance.
Surveillance – Location: 90 apps track location and little
else, though location tracking is also offered by most thorough
