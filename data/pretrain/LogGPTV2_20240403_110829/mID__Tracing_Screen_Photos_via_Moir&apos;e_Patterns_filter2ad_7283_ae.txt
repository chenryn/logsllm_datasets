for each participant, in which we ask three choice questions
and three 7-point scale questions, and the detailed descriptions
of each question are summarized in Tab. 4 in Appendix 11.3.
For comparison, we conduct another contrast test using a PDF
document without mID. From Tab. 4, we can see that the ﬁrst
3 choice questions are essay-content-related, which are the
superﬁcial tasks of the test. The real aim is to learn whether the
participants feel or notice any visual abnormality during the
process of reading (Question 6) and we cover it up with two
transitional questions (Question 4 and 5). The results shown
in Fig. 13 demonstrate that the participants hardly perceive the
existence of mID in the course of normal use (with an average
of 1.147, a standard deviation of 0.429, a 95% conﬁdence
interval of [1.003,1.291] on a 7-point scale) compared with
the mID-free situation (with an average of 1.118, a standard

deviation of 0.322, a 95% conﬁdence interval of [1.009,1.226]
on a 7-point scale). Thus, mID should be able to satisfy the
requirement of no visual impact on users.
To study how well the decoding technique works for the
realistic photos taken by attackers, we conduct a real-world
experiment by asking each volunteer to take 5 photos towards
the mID-embedded screen after ﬁnishing the questionnaire sur-
vey, with the imagination of leaking important information to
competitors and the need of capturing the information on the
screen completely and clearly. The results illustrate that for
the 170 photos taken by the volunteers, an average decoding
accuracy of around 95% can be achieved. In addition, the re-
sults demonstrate that more than 91% (31/34) volunteers take
photos with Moiré patterns as they are used to them. The other
3 users carefully adjust the shooting angle and distance to
avoid Moiré patterns. However, the adjustment is not adopted
by most users since it may twist the photo content. It indicates
that the attackers are likely to include Moiré patterns in the
screen photos, although studying people’s willingness will
need to be further studied in the future.
8 Discussion and Limitations
In this section, we discuss several issues of mID as well as its
limitations.
In-camera Image Processing. Modern smartphones uti-
lize in-camera image processing techniques such as auto-
focusing, optical anti-vibration, HDR, and multi-camera sys-
tem to form a better picture. Among those, HDR combines
a sequence of photos to achieve a greater dynamic range of
luminosity, and we use it by default in our evaluation. To il-
lustrate the impact of HDR, we conduct a contrast experiment
with the HDR-deactivated Nexus 5 smartphone. The results
demonstrate that HDR can reduce the BER from 0.4% to
0.2% for the Nexus 5 smartphone. We assume it is because
that HDR can increase the luminosity difference between
the bit “0” and “1”, and is beneﬁcial to mID decoding. The
multi-camera system combines photos from each individual
camera to achieve a better depth of ﬁeld. In our evaluation,
we use 3 single-camera and 3 dual-camera smartphones, and
the results shown in Sec. 6.3.2 demonstrate that dual-camera
phones show a slightly higher NER but can still achieve a
good performance (∼ 93%).
Post-camera Image Processing. We adopt the same de-
sign assumption as the ones of watermarking or stegano-
graphic techniques, i.e., adversaries are unaware of the tech-
nique, and we hide information by embedding IDs in Moiré
patterns that appear natural. Nevertheless, in a rare case, the
adversary may process the captured screen photos to reduce
the risk of being traced, as mentioned in Sec. 3. The possi-
ble post-camera processing techniques include two types: (1)
commonly-used image editing operations such as photo du-
plication, photo compression, image up/downscaling, format
conversion, and image cut, and (2) specially-designed evasion
algorithms targeted at removing Moiré stripes.
For the former, we randomly choose 10 photos from the
screen photos collected under the default settings and con-
duct experiments to investigate whether mID can resist these
attacks. From the results shown in Tab. 3, we can see that mID
can successfully resist the attacks of photo duplication (copy
and paste), compression (lossless), upscaling (any upscaling
ratio), and format conversion (PNG to JPG). The reason is
that those attacks do not or hardly cause information loss
of the screen photos (upscaling even increases the amount
of information contained in the photos), thus have no obvi-
ous impact on mID decoding. The rest of the attacks, on the
contrary, may affect the content of the photo and thus the
decoding. For image downscaling, we evaluate its impact
by setting the downscaling ratio to 0.9, 0.8, ..., 0.1, and the
information loses uniformly. The results show that mID can
achieve a good performance (>90%) with a downscaling ratio
larger than 0.6. With a smaller ratio, e.g., 0.5, many details
of the photos, including the Moiré patterns, are lost, resulting
a performance decrease. However, in this case, the content
in the photo is blurred as well, which may affect the reading.
For image cut, as we only embed mID in the vicinity of ROI,
removing other photo areas do not impact the decoding of
mID. If the adversary must remove the Moiré areas, which is
possible but may be difﬁcult since they are usually surrounded
by ROI, we may not obtain enough information to recover
the embedded mID. Thus, in general, mID is able to resist the
attacks of photo duplication, photo compression, image up-
scaling, and format conversion, and partial attacks of image
downscaling and image cut.
For the latter, existing Moiré pattern evasion approaches
mainly have three categories: (1) adding an optical low-pass
ﬁlter (OLPE) over the camera lens, (2) using an enhanced
color interpolation algorithm, and (3) employing post image
processing techniques. The ﬁrst two categories are both pre-

are not capable of removing existing Moiré stripes contained
in the screen photos. For the last category, however, automat-
ically removing Moiré patterns from a single photo is still
challenging at present even with the help of deep learning [52].
In most cases, it is still done manually with professional image
processing software. We admit that such evasion is possible
but at the cost of rendering the photo blurred and thus may
greatly increase the difﬁculty of reading. Thus, we believe
that in most cases, in the interest of leaking as much informa-
tion as possible, adversaries will not bother to remove Moiré
patterns.
Display Device. In the aforementioned evaluation, we eval-
uate the performance of mID with display devices of various
manufacturers, models, sizes and panel types. In addition to
these factors, the resolution and image rendering mode of
display devices may also have impacts on the performance
of mID. The dominated resolution of digital screens on the
current market is 2 K, and is likely to be increased to 4 K in
the future. For mID, resolution enhancement is favorable since
it can help smoothen the gratings as a result of decreased
distance between two adjacent stripes. For image rendering
mode, most users do not change the default settings (with a
standard gamma value γ = 2.2). If by any chance, the users
select other rendering modes, e.g., Low Blue Light, Cinema,
or Game modes that are available on some mainstream mon-
itors and laptops, the gamma value is likely to be different.
However, it will not affect mID because we can obtain the
current gamma value of the screen through relevant APIs, and
make corresponding adjustments in the luminance correction
process.
Capturing Device. Considering convenience and conceal-
ment, we assume that smartphones are the most likely cap-
turing devices. However, mID utilizes the interaction between
display devices and the CFA of digital cameras. In practice,
other digital photographic equipment, e.g., DSLR (Digital Sin-
gle Lens Reﬂex) cameras, can also capture the Moiré patterns
and thus can cooperate with mID. In addition, compared with
smartphones’ built-in cameras, they employ less image pro-
cessing algorithms during photo forming, and thus the Moiré
patterns captured are closer to the theoretical superposition
results, which may contribute to higher decoding accuracy.
Transmission over Instant-messaging Tools. The adver-
sary may exﬁltrate the captured screen photo via instant-
messaging tools, e.g., WhatsApp, Skype, and QQ. Image trans-
mission via instant-messaging tools has two forms: (1) The
image is transmitted as a ﬁle, and (2) The image is transmitted
as a photo. The ﬁrst form is usually (1) lossless (neither the
format or size is changed), or (2) format converted (e.g., PNG
to JPG). The second form is usually (3) downscaled (com-
pressed). To exﬁltrate the conﬁdential information clearly,
the adversary is more likely to share the screen photo as a
ﬁle. In this case, experimental results demonstrate that mID
shows no performance difference in decoding 30 screen pho-
tos before/after shared as ﬁles since mID is robust to format
conversion attacks. In a few cases, the adversary may choose
to share the screen photo directly as a photo. In this case,
the screen photo is downscaled and the EXIF (exchangeable
image ﬁle) information is lost. Since we encode mID in the hor-
izontal direction and do not rely on any EXIF information, the
horizontal downscaling ratio (in the form of pixel numbers) is
the main factor that may affect the decoding accuracy. Based
on our experiments, the horizontal downscaling ratio depends
on the photo contents and the used instant-messaging tools
(different tools may use different compression algorithms),
and usually ranges from 0.3 to 0.8. With the current encoding
parameters shown in Sec. 6.1, mID can still decode screen
photos with a horizontal downscaling ratio above 0.6 (i.e.,
a pixel loss of up to 64%) after shared. For screen photos
with smaller horizontal downscaling ratios, the decoding ac-
curacy drops, e.g., by 63.5% for a ratio of 0.5. This can be
addressed by adding more redundant pixels, i.e., increasing
the value of k, for encoding. Experimental results show that
with a larger k = 8, the decoding scheme can cope with a
horizontal downscaling ratio as low as 0.3. Thus, we assume
mID has the potential to survive from the transmission over
instant-messaging tools.
Encoding Space. The encoding space of mID mainly de-
pends on the resolution of the display device and the com-
position of its current page. Speciﬁcally, a higher display
resolution or a simpler page composition lead to a larger en-
coding space. An N-bit mID takes q = 2k × n× N pixels in
width with the capability of identifying 2N−4 devices. With a
minimal grating height of p = 50, for a display device with
a resolution of 1920× 1080 pixels, the encoding space limit
is 2[ 1920
p ] = 21176 with our default implementation.
We acknowledge that the encoding space cannot reach the
limit in practice since only portions of the screen can be used
to embed mID. However, we believe that the encoding space
of mID is still relatively large and sufﬁcient for screen photo
forensics, especially for highly-conﬁdential scenarios.

Shooting Focus, Distance and Angle. mID works well
with photos focused on the center of the screen and taken
within a distance range of (60 cm,80 cm) and an angle range
of (−20◦,20◦). We choose these parameters to reﬂect the
goal of adversaries who wish to capture the contents on the
screen completely and clearly. Thus, we set the For the shoot-
ing focus, we set it on the center of the screen during the
experiments considering adversaries’ wishes to capture the
conﬁdential content completely and clearly. It is okay if the
camera is not centrally focused as long as the mID-related
Moiré patterns are captured in the photos. For the shooting
distance and angle, we agree that beyond the aforementioned
ranges may render the generated Moiré patterns out of the
visible frequency range, leading to partial or even no Moiré
patterns in the captured screen photos. However, we argue
that the distances and angles that mID supports can cover most
of the possible shooting positions, given the goal of capturing

Comparison with Other Invisible Digital Watermark
Techniques. Due to the noises introduced by the electronic
screen and the camera sensors, traditional invisible digital wa-
termarks may no longer be recognizable after photographed.
Thus, we propose to utilize Moiré patterns for photo foren-
sics since they are optical phenomena generated during the
process of photographing screens. We compare our methods
with 8 commonly-used invisible digital watermarks includ-
ing 3 popular commercial tools: (1) SignMyImage [42], (2)
Icemark [39], and (3) OpenStego [40], and 5 open source tech-
niques from GitHub [21]: (1) Wavelet Transform, (2) Discrete
Wavelet Transform, (3) Discrete Cosine Transform, (4) Least
Signiﬁcant Bit, and (5) Discrete Wavelet Transform and Sin-
gular Value Decomposition. The results show that none of the
digital watermarks provided by the aforementioned methods
work in the screen-photo-based leakage attacks while mID
can successfully trace to the source of a screen photo with an
average accuracy of 96%. Thus, we believe mID is suitable
for screen photo forensics.
9 Related Work
In this section, we present studies relevant to ours. Speciﬁ-
cally, we discuss the aspects related to image watermarking,
Moiré pattern, and optical cryptography.
Image watermarking to enable digital media protec-
tion. Digital media requires protection when transferring
through internet or other mediums. Image watermarking tech-
niques have been developed to fulﬁll this requirement [38].
Most existing image watermarking approaches are performed
in the spatial [1, 7, 29] or DWT (discrete wavelet trans-
form) [12, 20, 23] domains and use frame synchronization
methods to resist to geometric distortions. Beyond that,
Riad et al. [36, 37] proposed a robust watermarking method
based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for printed and
scanned identity images. Gourrame et al. [13] proposed a
Fourier based watermarking method to resist print-cam at-
tacks for real captured images and revealed that FFT domain
resists better to the perspective distortions compared to the
DWT domain. Thongkor and Amornraksa [41] proposed a
watermarking method for posters that is robust against distor-
tions due to printing and camera capturing processes. Differ-
ent from these methods, mID is an optical watermark based
on Moiré patterns and can be used for screen photo forensics.
Leveraging Moiré patterns to hide invisible messages.
Moiré patterns are explored in various studies to hide mes-
sages. Lebanon et al. [22] explored ways to superimpose
various patterns of gratings to create Moiré patterns of face
images. Hersch et al. [15] created moving Moiré components
running up and down at different speeds and orientations with
the help of a revealing layer. Desmedt et al. [9] created secret
sharing schemes based on Moiré patterns with shares being re-
alistically looking images. Tsai et al. [43] enabled the creation
of Moiré art and allowed visual decoding by superimposing
grating images printed on separate transparencies. Walger
and Hersch [45] proposed a method to embed information
corresponding to up to seven level-line Moirés within a single
base layer, and the information can be recovered later with a
revealer printed on a transparency or an array of cylindrical
lenses. These studies mainly use two semi-transparent lay-
ers and overlap one on the other to reveal hidden images or
information. By contrast, mID exploits the nonlinear optical
interaction of the screen-camera channel to embed identity
information.
Optical and visual cryptography to enable secure infor-
mation exchange. Existing techniques [3, 16, 34] of visual
cryptography (VC) usually encode a secret image into several
shares with camouﬂaged visual patterns, and stack a sufﬁ-
cient number of shares to reveal the original secret image. For
instance, Huang and Wu [17] proposed an optical watermark-
ing method in which a hidden binary image can be decoded
by superposing a transparent key image onto a printed im-
age. These studies [5, 27] applied VC to Quick Response
(QR) codes to check the identity accessing to the QR codes
or control the permission to the protected data. Inspired by
the aforementioned work, mID utilizes the inherent attributes
of the screen-camera channel and proposes a Moiré-pattern-
based optical watermarking scheme to enable screen photo
forensics.
10 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose mID, a digital forensics mechanism
to identify the source of the ﬁle leakages via photos utilizing
Moiré patterns. We show that Moiré patterns are ideal for
photo forensics because they are optical phenomena naturally
generated during the process of photographing screens and
are observed regularly in photos of digital screens. Leverag-
ing it, we design an effective screen photo forensics scheme,
and evaluate it with 5 display devices and 6 smartphones of
various manufacturers and models. The evaluation results
demonstrate that mID can achieve an average BER of 0.6%
