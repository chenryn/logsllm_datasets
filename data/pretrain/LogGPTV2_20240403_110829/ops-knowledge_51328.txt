User: Has anyone seen this error in celery (a distribute task worker in Python) before?
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/mcapp/.virtualenv/lister/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/celery/task/trace.py", line 228, in trace_task

IndexError: list index out of range
This particular version of celery is 3.0.19, and happens when the celery chord feature is used.  We don't think there is any error in our application, as 99% of the time our code works correctly, but under heavier loads this error would happen.  We are trying to find out if this is an actual bug in our application or a celery bug, any help would be greatly appreciated.
Assistant: This is an error that occurs when a chord header has no tasks in it. Celery tries to access the tasks in the header using self.tasks[0] which results in an index error since there are no tasks in the list.
