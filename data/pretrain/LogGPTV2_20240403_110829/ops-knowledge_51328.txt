Has anyone encountered this error while using Celery (a distributed task queue for Python)?

**Traceback:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/mcapp/.virtualenv/lister/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/celery/task/trace.py", line 228, in trace_task
    R = retval = fun(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/home/mcapp/.virtualenv/lister/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/celery/task/trace.py", line 415, in protected_call
    return self.run(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/home/mcapp/lister/lister/tasks/init.py", line 69, in update_playlist_db
    video_update(videos)
  File "/home/mcapp/lister/lister/tasks/init.py", line 55, in video_update
    chord(tasks)(update_complete.s(update_id=update_id, update_type='db', complete=True))
  File "/home/mcapp/.virtualenv/lister/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/celery/canvas.py", line 464, in call
    _chord = self.type
  File "/home/mcapp/.virtualenv/lister/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/celery/canvas.py", line 461, in type
    return self._type or self.tasks[0].type.app.tasks['celery.chord']
IndexError: list index out of range
```

**Details:**
- Celery version: 3.0.19
- The error occurs when using the `chord` feature.
- Our application works correctly 99% of the time, but this error appears under heavier loads.

We suspect that this might be a bug in Celery rather than an issue with our application. We would greatly appreciate any help in determining whether this is a bug in our code or a Celery bug.

**Analysis:**
This error occurs when a chord header has no tasks. Celery attempts to access the first task in the header using `self.tasks[0]`, which results in an `IndexError` because the list is empty.
