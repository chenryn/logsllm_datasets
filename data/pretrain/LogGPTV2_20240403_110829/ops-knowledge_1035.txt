User: List common load balancing algorithms, how do they affect the performance of web applications?
Assistant: Common load balancing algorithms include: 1. Round Robin algorithm: allocate requests sequentially according to the order of the server list, and repeat. 2. Least Connection algorithm: Assign the request to the server with the least current connections. 3. IP Hash (IP Hash) algorithm: allocate requests according to the hash value of the client's IP address. 4. Weighted Round Robin Algorithm: Allocate requests to servers according to configured weights, and servers with higher weights receive more requests. 5. Weighted Least Connection algorithm: According to the configured weight, the request is allocated to the server with the least current connection and high available weight. Different implementations of these load balancing algorithms can affect the performance of web applications. The implementation of the polling algorithm is relatively simple, but it will cause the load of all servers to be the same, and the load of some servers may be too high, while the load of some servers is too low. The minimum number of connections algorithm can dynamically allocate requests to ensure that the load of each server is as balanced as possible, but frequent calculation and scheduling of servers may cause performance problems. The IP hash algorithm produces different hash values due to different client IP addresses, which can ensure that requests are sent to the same server, but it may cause overloading of hotspot servers. The weighted round robin and weighted minimum number of connections algorithms can distribute requests according to the weight of the server, and solve the problem that some server loads are too high or too low, but the server needs to be configured and adjusted to ensure the smooth operation of the entire system.
