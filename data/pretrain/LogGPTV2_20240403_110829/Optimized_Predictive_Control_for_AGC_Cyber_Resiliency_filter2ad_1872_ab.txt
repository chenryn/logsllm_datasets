#### Figures and Data

**Figure 2:**
- **(a)** Validation of the prediction for AGC frequency under a false data injection attack. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis shows the grid's frequency in Hz. During the attack, the grid's frequency fluctuates and decreases to a minimum of 58.6 Hz. The predicted values closely match the actual values, indicating that the resilient control system can detect and mitigate the anomaly.
- **(b)** Efficacy of prior information in detection probability. The plot compares the detection probability against the magnitude of the false data injection attack. Resilient control using prior information has a higher detection probability compared to the approach without prior information.

**Figure 3:**
- **(a)** Predicted frequency deviation using the regression model. The x-axis represents the AGC cycle index (time delay), and the y-axis shows the frequency deviation. The prediction improves with an increasing number of AGC cycles, leading to a longer reaction time but better accuracy in detecting stealthy attacks.
- **(b)** Impact of prior information on detection probability over time. The approach with prior information achieves a 100% detection rate in a shorter period compared to the approach without prior information.

#### Simulation Setup

The simulation involves a communication link between a control center and a substation. An SSL session is established every 4 seconds to transmit sensor readings. The AGC simulation under no attack starts at \( t = 15 \) seconds and terminates at \( t = 340 \) seconds, with data collected at a frequency of 0.25 (equivalent to 4 seconds). The simulation generates zero-mean process and measurement noises as default settings.

To create a dataset for evaluation, we utilized the New England ISO load data for a 3-area power system [3]. We modified the load data by adding unavailable line load information from our simulation results. Additionally, we duplicated the data with the simulation results of attack scenarios. The corrupted load data, with a standard deviation of 97, was correlated with actual simulation results to ensure dataset accuracy. To reduce the dataset size, we used a smaller range of ACE delay attacks.

The data was then fed into a Gaussian process regression model with hyper-parameter tuning using the Weka tool. This process produced the mean and covariance matrix of the corresponding power flow and frequency deviation measurements. Auxiliary variables and prior information were incorporated into the model to accurately correlate the measurements with historical values.

#### Simulation Results

**Figure 2 (a):** 
This figure shows the performance of the proposed resilient control approach during a false data injection attack on power flow measurements. The horizontal axis represents time in seconds, and the vertical axis represents the grid's frequency in Hz. During the injection attack, the grid's frequency fluctuates and decreases to a minimum of 58.6 Hz. The system's predicted value closely matches the actual values, indicating that the resilient control system can detect and mitigate the anomaly. The system maintains the frequency according to the predicted values using a combination of prior auxiliary information and independent power system attributes.

**Figure 2 (b):**
This figure illustrates the detection probability against the magnitude of the false data injection attack. The results show that resilient control using prior information has a better attack detection probability compared to the approach without prior information.

**Figure 3 (a):**
This figure compares the predicted frequency deviation values during time delay attacks. The algorithm calculates the frequency deviation based on prior information and historical data of local frequency and tie-line power flow measurements. The prediction improves with an increasing number of AGC cycles, leading to a longer reaction time but better accuracy in detecting stealthy attacks. The system remains stable under lower frequency fluctuations in stealthy attacks, marking the field measurements as anomalous after identifying the attack.

**Figure 3 (b):**
This figure compares the detection probability against time. The approach with prior information clearly identifies the attack with a 100% detection rate in a shorter period than the approach without prior auxiliary information.

#### Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed an approach based on prior information for AGC cyber-attack detection and resiliency. Specifically, we demonstrated that specific power system attributes, in conjunction with prior auxiliary information, can improve the system's resiliency against cyber-attacks. We validated our approach using the PowerWorld simulator based on the three-area New England IEEE 39-bus model. The results show that incorporating prior information based on Gaussian process regression can significantly improve the system's resiliency and the probability of correctly predicting cyber-attacks. Future work will investigate the performance of our approach for malicious and natural load disturbances, and we plan to add more power system attributes and prior information to evaluate this approach against a wide variety of cyber-attacks.
