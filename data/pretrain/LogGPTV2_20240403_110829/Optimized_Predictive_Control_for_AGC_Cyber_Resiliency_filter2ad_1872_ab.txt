and a substation. An SSL session is established every 4 seconds to
transmit sensor readings. The simulation of AGC under no attack
starts at t = 15s and terminates at t = 340s, and data is collected
with a frequency of 0.25, which is equivalent to 4 seconds. The
simulation generates zero-mean process and measurement noises
as the default settings.
To create a dataset for evaluation, we also utilize the New Eng-
land ISO load data for a 3-area power system [3]; we modified the
load data by adding unavailable line load information from our
simulation results. Moreover, we duplicated the data with the sim-
ulation results of attack scenarios: The corrupted load data with
the standard deviation of 97 was correlated with actual simulation
results for the accuracy of the dataset. To reduce the size of the
dataset, we used a smaller range of ACE delay attacks. The data is
then fed into Gaussian process regression with hyper-parameters
tuning in the Weka tool to produce mean and covariance matrix of
the corresponding power flow and frequency deviation measure-
ments. Towards this end, auxiliary variables and prior information
are fed into the model to correlate the corresponding measurements
with the historical values accurately.
Simulation Results. Figure 2 (a) shows the results of our pro-
posed resilient control approach during the false data injection
attack on power flow measurements. The horizontal axis is time in
seconds, while the vertical axis is the gird’s frequency. During the
injection attack to power flow and frequency readings, the gird’s
frequency fluctuates and decreases to a minimum of 58.6 Hz. As
seen from the figure, the system’s predicted value is closer to the ac-
tual values, the performance of the resilient control system clearly
suggests an anomaly; therefore, it maintains the system’s frequency
according to the predicted values using the combination of prior
auxiliary information and independent power system attributes.
Furthermore, Figure 2 (b) shows the detection probability against
the magnitude of the false data injection attack. The results show
that resilient control using prior information has a better attack
detection probability compared to the results of detecting an attack
without utilizing prior information and attributes.
Figure 3 (a) compares the predicted frequency deviation values
during the time delay attacks. The algorithm calculates the fre-
quency deviation based on prior information and historical data
of local measurement of frequency and tie-line power flow. The
prediction improves with an increasing number of AGC cycles; it
means there will be more waiting time for the detection of an attack,
leading to a longer reaction time to counteract the attack. However,
the system remains stable under lower frequency fluctuation in
stealthy attacks as it marks the field measurements as anomalous
after identifying the attack; this means the accuracy of detection
becomes better for the stealthy time delay attack after some AGC
cycles. Similarly, Figure 3 (b) compares the detection probability
against time. The approach with prior information clearly identifies
the attack with a 100 % detection rate in a shorter period than using
without prior auxiliary information.
4 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed an approach based on prior informa-
tion for the AGC cyber-attack detection and resiliency. Specifically,
we showed that specific power system attributes in conjunction
with prior auxiliary information could improve the system’s re-
siliency against cyber-attacks. To validate our approach, we used
the PowerWorld simulator based on the three-area New England
IEEE 39-bus model. The results demonstrate that incorporating
prior information based on Gaussian process regression can signifi-
cantly improve the system’s resiliency and probability of predicting
cyber-attacks correctly. Our future work will aim to investigate
the performance of our approach for malicious and natural load
disturbances. Moreover, we plan to add more power systems at-
tributes and prior information to evaluate this approach against a
wide variety of cyber-attacks.
