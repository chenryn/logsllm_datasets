Assistant: The following are the steps to build a LAMP environment in the CentOS 7 system: 1. Update the system software package ```sh sudo yum update ``` 2. Install the Apache web server ```sh sudo yum install httpd ``` 3. Start Apache Set the server to start automatically at boot ```sh sudo systemctl start httpd.service sudo systemctl enable httpd.service ``` 4. To test the Apache service, open the browser, enter the server IP address or domain name, and see the Apache default webpage, which means The Apache server is already running normally. 5. Install the MySQL database ```sh sudo yum install mariadb-server mariadb ``` 6. Start the MySQL server and set the boot self-start ```sh sudo systemctl start mariadb.service sudo systemctl enable mariadb.service ``` 7. Run the mysql_secure_installation script to set the MySQL root account password and other security options ```sh sudo mysql_secure_installation ``` 8. Install PHP and related extensions ```sh sudo yum install php php-mysql php-gd php-mbstring ``` 9 . Restart the Apache service to associate PHP with Apache ```sh sudo systemctl restart httpd.service ``` 10. Create a php test file to check whether PHP is working properly, in Apache's default web root directory (/var/www /html/) create a phpinfo.php file ```sh sudo nano /var/www/html/phpinfo.php ``` enter the following: ```sh <?php phpinfo(); ?> ``` Save and exit. 11. Use a browser to access the test file (http://server IP address/phpinfo.php), if you can see the PHP information page, it means that the LAMP environment has been successfully set up. So far, you have successfully set up a LAMP environment on the CentOS server.
