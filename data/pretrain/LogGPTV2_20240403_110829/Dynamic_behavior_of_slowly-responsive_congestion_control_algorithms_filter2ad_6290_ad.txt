### Figure 11: Number of ACKs Needed for a Φ-Fair Allocation

Figure 11 illustrates the number of ACKs required for a Φ-fair allocation for various values of \( b \) when Φ = 0.1 and \( \epsilon = 0.1 \). Other values of \( \epsilon \) yield similarly shaped curves. This analysis is applicable to TCP under moderate to low loss probabilities, as it does not account for retransmission timeouts or accurately model TCP's behavior when multiple packets are lost from a window of data. The rate of TFRC (Transmit Flow Rate Control) varies from 0.14 to 0.28 packets/sec, depending on whether the history discounting option is enabled [7].

### Implications of Low Aggressiveness in SlowCC Mechanisms

In this section, we explore the implications of the low aggressiveness of SlowCC mechanisms in environments where there is a sudden increase in available bandwidth. The fundamental tradeoff in SlowCC mechanisms is that, while they provide a smooth sending rate during steady-state conditions, they are slow to take advantage of a sudden increase in available bandwidth compared to TCP. The slower the SlowCC mechanism, the more sluggish it will be in responding to such changes. This sluggishness does not interfere with competing traffic in the network but may discourage applications from using extremely slow congestion control mechanisms.

To illustrate this, consider scenarios with long-lived flows where the available bandwidth is suddenly doubled. We define \( f(k) \) as the average link utilization (expressed as a fraction) over the first \( k \) round-trip times after the bandwidth has doubled. Link utilization depends on the congestion control mechanism, the number of round-trip times \( k \), the round-trip time, and the link bandwidth in packets/sec.

### Figure 12: 0.1-Fair Convergence Times for TFRC(b)

Figure 12 plots the 0.1-fair convergence times for TFRC(b) flows for different values of \( b \). As shown, the 0.1-fair convergence time does not increase as rapidly with increased slowness of TFRC flows. This is because TFRC relies on a fixed number of loss intervals to adjust its sending rate, unlike the multiplicative decrease in TCP.

### Loss in Throughput in a Time of Plenty

The slow increase rate of SlowCC can result in a loss of throughput compared to TCP when there is a sudden increase in available bandwidth. The aggressiveness of a congestion control mechanism is defined as the maximum increase in the sending rate in one round-trip time, in packets per second, given the absence of congestion [8]. For TCP(a, b), the aggressiveness is simply the parameter \( a \), while for TFRC, the aggressiveness ranges from 0.14 to 0.28 packets/sec.

### Figure 13: Average Link Utilization for Various SlowCCs

To evaluate \( f(k) \), we use a simulation scenario with ten identical flows, all using the same congestion control mechanism, sharing a bottleneck link of 10 Mbps. At time 500 seconds, five flows are stopped, effectively doubling the bandwidth available to the remaining five flows. Figure 13 shows \( f(20) \) and \( f(200) \), the link utilization in the first 20 and 200 round-trip times, respectively, after the first five flows stopped, for TCP(1/b), SQRT(1/b), and TFRC(b) for a range of parameters \( b \). The figure indicates that while TCP achieves about 86% utilization after the first 20 round-trip times, TCP(1/8) and TFRC(8) achieve 75% and 65% utilization, respectively, highlighting the cost paid by SlowCC mechanisms in failing to promptly utilize the newly available bandwidth.

### Loss in Throughput in a Time of Oscillations

Section 4.2.1 considered the relative long-term fairness between TCP and SlowCC in an environment with sharp changes in available bandwidth, and Section 4.2.3 showed the penalty paid by SlowCC in being slow to take advantage of a sudden increase in available bandwidth. In this section, we examine the overall link utilization in an environment of rapidly changing available bandwidth when all flows use the same congestion control mechanism. We show that in such a dynamic environment, if all traffic consists of long-lived flows using SlowCC, the overall link utilization can be somewhat lower than with long-lived TCP flows, depending on the nature of the changes in available bandwidth. This is not presented as a reason not to deploy SlowCC but as an exploration of the possible costs in extreme environments.

### Figures 14 and 15: Effect of Varying Bandwidth on Link Utilization and Packet Loss Rate

To study the loss in throughput for SlowCC in an environment with changing network conditions, we use a simulation scenario with ten identical congestion-controlled flows competing with an ON/OFF CBR source. The available bandwidth for the congestion-controlled flows varies between 15 Mbps and 5 Mbps (a 3:1 ratio) as the CBR flow is OFF and ON, respectively. Figure 14 shows the effect of the changing available bandwidth on the overall throughput, and Figure 15 shows the corresponding packet loss rate. The period of the competing CBR flow significantly impacts the overall throughput of the congestion-controlled flows. For example, when the CBR flow has ON and OFF times of 50 ms, throughput is high for TCP(1/8), TCP, and TFRC(6). However, when the CBR flow has ON and OFF times of 200 ms, four times the round-trip time, a congestion-controlled flow receives less than 80% of the overall available bandwidth, regardless of the congestion control mechanism used.

### Figure 16: Effect of 10:1 Oscillations in Network Bandwidth

Figure 16 shows that in a more extreme environment with repeated 10:1 changes in available bandwidth, none of the three congestion control mechanisms perform particularly well. For certain frequencies of change in the underlying bandwidth, TFRC performs particularly poorly relative to TCP. This underscores the point that although TCP and SlowCC mechanisms might perform similarly in a steady-state environment, this is not necessarily the case in more extreme conditions with rapid changes. An environment with varying load may result in lower throughput and lower link utilization with SlowCCs than with TCPs.

### Potential Benefits of Slowly-Responsive Algorithms

The primary motivation for developing and deploying SlowCC mechanisms is their smoother sending rate compared to TCP in a steady-state environment with a reasonably smooth packet loss process. The smoothness metric is defined as the largest ratio between the sending rates in two consecutive round-trip times. In a steady-state environment with a periodic packet drop rate, TFRC has a perfect smoothness metric of 1, while TCP(b) congestion control has a smoothness metric of \( 1 - b \). Congestion control mechanisms that reduce their window or rate in response to a single drop cannot have perfect smoothness [8]. This section focuses on the smoothness of SlowCC mechanisms in environments with bursty loss patterns, where the relative smoothness of various TCP-compatible congestion controls becomes more complex.

### Figure 17: TFRC and TCP(1/8) with a Mildly Bursty Loss Pattern

Figure 17 compares TFRC and TCP(1/8) with a mildly bursty loss pattern. The top graph shows TFRC, and the bottom graph shows TCP(1/8). The graphs illustrate the sending rate in 0.2-second bins and 1-second bins, along with the packet drops over time.
