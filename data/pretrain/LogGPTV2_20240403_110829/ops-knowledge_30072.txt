I am seeking the community's feedback on a language choice our team is considering for the near future. We are a software development team, and I work with a group of Oracle and SQL Server DBAs supporting a cross-platform Java application that runs on Oracle Application Server. Our codebase includes both SQL Server and Oracle, and we support customers on Windows, Solaris, and Linux servers.

Many of our frequent tasks are not sufficiently automated. Where automation does exist, it is primarily through shell scripts, with limited equivalent functionality on Windows. This has led to the need for redundant script development across multiple platforms. To address this, we are looking to adopt a cross-platform scripting language that can replace Bash and avoid the need for awkward translations to Cygwin or Batch files.

The ideal language should meet the following criteria:

1. **Dynamic**: Not a compiled language like Java or C.
2. **Easily Available**: Readily accessible on Windows, Solaris, Linux, and possibly AIX.
3. **Minimal Setup**: Requires little to no setup, as root access is not always available.
4. **Easy to Adopt**: Suitable for DBAs who are not hardcore developers but are familiar with shell scripting.
5. **Readable Code**: Easy to understand and maintain, even when written by others.
6. **Database Friendly**: Seamlessly integrates with both SQL Server and Oracle without requiring complex configurations.
7. **XML Features**: Includes some features to simplify XML handling.

It would be advantageous if the language runs on the JVM, as this will almost always be installed on every server (especially on all application servers). Additionally, many of our developers are already proficient in Java, making the JVM a logical choice. However, this is not an exclusive requirement, as Python is also a strong contender.

We have considered the following options: Groovy, Scala, Jython, Python, Ruby, and Perl. While no one on the team has extensive experience with these languages, I personally have a good amount of experience with Java and Groovy.

We are looking for a language that is dynamic, easy to learn, and can seamlessly work with both SQL Server and Oracle. It should also include some XML simplification features and be appealing to DBAs, many of whom are currently very comfortable with Bash. 

What are your thoughts on this? Any recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

Chris
