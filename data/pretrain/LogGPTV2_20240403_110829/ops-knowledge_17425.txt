It seems like you are trying to activate a virtual environment on a Windows system, but encountering some issues. The `source` command is specific to Unix-based systems (like Linux and macOS) and is not recognized in the Windows Command Prompt. Instead, you should use the appropriate activation script for Windows.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you create and activate a virtual environment on Windows:

1. **Create the Virtual Environment:**
   You have already created the virtual environment using the following command:
   ```sh
   c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
   ```
   Note that the `--no-site-packages` flag is deprecated and no longer needed as it is now the default behavior.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   To activate the virtual environment on Windows, you need to run the `activate` script located in the `Scripts` directory of your virtual environment. Use the following command:
   ```sh
   c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Verify Activation:**
   Once activated, your command prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active. It will look something like this:
   ```sh
   (venv) c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>
   ```

4. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**
   When you are done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running:
   ```sh
   (venv) c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>deactivate
   ```

### Additional Notes:
- **Python Version:** You mentioned Python 7, which does not exist. The latest stable version of Python as of my last update is Python 3.9. Please ensure you are using a valid and supported version of Python.
- **Virtualenv Version:** You mentioned virtualenv 2.2.x, which is quite old. Consider upgrading to the latest version of `virtualenv` or using the built-in `venv` module that comes with Python 3.3 and later.

### Example of Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment Using `venv`:
```sh
c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>python -m venv venv

c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>venv\Scripts\activate
```

If you follow these steps, you should be able to create and activate your virtual environment without any issues.
