User: I wrote a python script but accidentally put an infinite while loop in my script.
How do I kill the process? I've tried ctrl+c but with no success. 
Are there any other option to try? 
I'm on Mac Os X 10.7.2 with python 2.7
Assistant: ps a to get the PID of your process. kill -9 <pid> to send it the unblockable SIGKILL signal.
Note that I only have a Linux box in front of me to test, so the OS X commands may be slightly different.
