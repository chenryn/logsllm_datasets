Opening an issue to discuss this: **should we think about moving the
functionality to read online data sources to a separate package?**
This was mentioned recently here #8842 (comment) and #8631 (comment)
Some reasons why we would want to move it:
  * This often needs much more urgent releases than pandas to fix changes in the remote sources. So with separate release cycle, this can speed up propagation of bugfixes to users
  * More general: to limit the scope of pandas as the core project, and to encourage that some people take ownership of this subproject (which is easier as a separate project?), publicize it separately, ..
Some questions that come to mind:
  * What should we move? (everything in remote_data.rst?) 
    * Everything in `io.data`? (the `DataReader` function for Yahoo and Google Finance, FRED and Fama/French, and the `Options` class
    * Also `io.wb` (certain World Bank data) and `io.ga` (google analytics interface)?
  * Should we move it all to one separate project, or to multiple?
  * Are there outside of pandas already some packages like this? (possibilities to merge with that/collaborate/..)
  * Who would be interested to take this up? To be a maintainer of such a package?
Pinging some of the people have worked on these subpackages (certainly add
others if you know):
