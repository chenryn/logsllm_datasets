User: I am debugging a Python application, that makes use of os.fork() at some point.
After evaluating the function PDB remains in the parent process (as I can see from the value returned from the function).
How do I switch between child and parent process in PDB?
Assistant: It seems like it automatically gets switched at some point (probably I/O).
If you want to force it though, you should call time.sleep().
