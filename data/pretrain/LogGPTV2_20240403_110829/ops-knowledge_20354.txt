I am using Berkeley DB (BDB) within an nginx environment. When a request is received, nginx passes the URI as a key to BDB and checks if there is a corresponding value in the BDB file.

In my testing, I added some data to BDB and then started nginx. Everything worked as expected, and I was able to access the data. However, when I tried to add new data to the BDB while nginx was running (using Python), I could not retrieve the newly added data through nginx. Interestingly, when I used a separate Python interpreter to check the BDB file, the new data was present.

Here are the steps involved in handling a request in nginx:

1. **Nginx Startup:**
   - Nginx initializes my plugin, which sets up the BDB environment and performs any necessary initialization.
   
2. **Request Handling:**
   - A request arrives at nginx.
   - The control is passed to the plugin, which checks if the key (URI) has a corresponding value in the BDB.
   - If the key exists, the value is returned; otherwise, the request is processed further.

### Additional Information
Berkeley DB supports the following configurations:
- A single process with one thread
- A single process with multiple threads
- Groups of cooperating processes
- Groups of unrelated processes

This setup should theoretically allow for concurrent updates and reads, but I am encountering issues with nginx not recognizing new data added to BDB while it is running.
