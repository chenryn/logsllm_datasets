User: According to the following system architecture, please provide a high availability and fault tolerance deployment plan. The system architecture includes multiple services, including:\n- Nginx server for load balancing and reverse proxy\n- application server for running web applications\n- database server for storing system data\n - Cache Server, for caching data\n- Log Server, for storing and managing system logs
Assistant: The following is a high-availability and fault-tolerant deployment solution: 1. The Nginx server adopts multi-node load balancing and failover, which is realized by using tools such as Heartbeat+Keepalived or Pacemaker. This can ensure that after a certain node goes down, the service can be automatically switched to other normal nodes. 2. The application server also adopts multi-node deployment, and performs load balancing among each node. At the same time, tools such as Heartbeat+Keepalived or Pacemaker are used to achieve failover to ensure high availability and fault tolerance of the service. 3. The database server is deployed in the way of master-slave replication. The master server is responsible for writing data, and the slave server is responsible for reading data, and can also perform backup. When the master server goes down, the slave server can take over from the master server to ensure data availability. In addition, you can also use the built-in high availability solutions provided by mainstream databases such as MySQL, such as MySQL Group Replication, MySQL InnoDB Cluster, etc. 4. The cache server is deployed in a cluster, and multiple nodes form a distributed cache system to achieve efficient data access and fault tolerance. When a node goes down, other nodes can continue to provide services without affecting the normal use of applications. 5. The log server also adopts multi-node deployment, and uses tools such as Elasticsearch and Logstash for distributed storage and log collection, analysis, and display. Among them, Elastic Stack such as ELK, EFK, etc. can be used to realize comprehensive monitoring and analysis of logs, so as to quickly locate and solve problems. If backup is required, you can use tools such as Filebeat and Logstash to back up logs to other places. Through the above deployment scheme, high availability and fault tolerance of the system can be achieved. However, the specific plan also depends on the actual scenario, such as the number of visits, data volume, application architecture, etc., which need to be adjusted after comprehensive consideration.
