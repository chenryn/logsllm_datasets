The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Connection broken for id <*>, my id = <*>, error = 和 Interrupting SendWorker
B: Received connection request /<*>:<*> 和 Connection broken for id <*>, my id = <*>, error =
C: Send worker leaving thread 和 Connection broken for id <*>, my id = <*>, error =
D: Expiring session <*>, timeout of <*>ms exceeded 和 Accepted socket connection from /<*>:<*>
