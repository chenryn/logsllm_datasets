ABSTRACT
In mobile networks, authentication is a required primitive for
the majority of security protocols. However, an adversary
can track the location of mobile nodes by monitoring pseu-
donyms used for authentication. A frequently proposed so-
lution to protect location privacy suggests that mobile nodes
collectively change their pseudonyms in regions called mix
zones. Because this approach is costly, self-interested mo-
bile nodes might decide not to cooperate and could thus
jeopardize the achievable location privacy.
In this paper,
we analyze the non-cooperative behavior of mobile nodes
by using a game-theoretic model, where each player aims at
maximizing its location privacy at a minimum cost. We ﬁrst
analyze the Nash equilibria in n-player complete information
games. Because mobile nodes in a privacy-sensitive system
do not know their opponents’ payoﬀs, we then consider in-
complete information games. We establish that symmetric
Bayesian-Nash equilibria exist with simple threshold strate-
gies in n-player games and derive the equilibrium strategies.
By means of numerical results, we show that mobile nodes
become selﬁsh when the cost of changing pseudonyms is
small, whereas they cooperate more when the cost of chang-
ing pseudonyms increases. Finally, we design a protocol - the
PseudoGame protocol - based on the results of our analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Mobile ad hoc networks, such as networks of directly com-
municating hand-held devices [1, 2, 3], vehicular networks [31,
56] and delay tolerant networks [20], have brought new se-
curity challenges due to their mobile and infrastructure-less
nature. In particular, in order to verify the identity of com-
municating parties, to revoke misbehaving nodes and to es-
tablish secure associations, ad hoc networks typically require
an authentication feature. To do so, each mobile node is pre-
loaded with an asymmetric key pair and all the messages it
sends are signed with the same private key. As receivers use
the public key of a sender to verify the signature, the public
key is usually sent along with the messages. However, much
to the detriment of privacy, external parties can monitor
public keys to learn the locations of mobile nodes.
Hence, when privacy-conscious nodes authenticate them-
selves to others, they must avoid revealing privacy-sensitive
information. The multiple pseudonym approach [15], sug-
gested in the context of Internet communications, assigns
a set of asymmetric key pairs to every node that are used
alternatively in order to protect their privacy.1 Both indus-
try [4] and academia [7, 9, 37, 43, 50] have adopted this
approach in order to achieve location privacy in mobile ad
hoc networks. A set of pseudonyms is usually preloaded
into mobile devices by an oﬀ-line certiﬁcation authority [51].
Then, over time, mobile nodes change the pseudonyms used
to send messages. To impede an adversary from linking old
and new pseudonyms, a change of pseudonym should be spa-
tially and temporally coordinated among mobile nodes [7].
More speciﬁcally, a node cannot free-ride on the pseudonym
change of others to achieve location privacy as its pseudo-
nym can still be tracked. Hence, location privacy is not
achieved by itself but requires a collective eﬀort from neigh-
boring mobile nodes.
The coordination of pseudonym changes has become a
central topic of research with various approaches proposed.
One solution [9] consists in changing pseudonyms periodi-
cally, at a pre-determined frequency. The mechanism works
if at least two mobile nodes change their pseudonyms in
proximity, a condition that is rarely met (as the probability
of a synchronous change is low). Base stations can be used
as coordinators to synchronize pseudonym changes [37], but
this solution requires help from the infrastructure. The ap-
proach in [27] enables mobile nodes to change their pseudo-

324nyms at speciﬁc time instances (e.g., before associating with
wireless base stations). However, this solution achieves loca-
tion privacy only with respect to the infrastructure. Another
approach [7, 22, 24] coordinates pseudonym changes by forc-
ing mobile nodes to change their pseudonyms within pre-
determined regions called mix zones. This approach however
lacks ﬂexibility because the locations of mix zones are ﬁxed
by a central authority and must be learned by mobile nodes
prior to entering the network. Several researchers advocated
the use of a distributed solution [36, 37, 43], where mobile
nodes coordinate pseudonym changes to dynamically obtain
mix zones. To do this, a mobile node simply broadcasts a
pseudonym change request to its neighbors. This solution
is particularly appealing in mobile ad hoc networks because
it does not require the help of the infrastructure nor prior
knowledge of the location of mix zones.
Nevertheless, the multiple pseudonym approach has draw-
backs that aﬀect the performance of current solutions. First,
a pseudonym change causes considerable overhead, thus re-
ducing networking performance: for example, routing algo-
rithms must update their routing tables [51]. Second, given
the cost of pseudonym generation and management by the
central authority, mobile nodes are usually assigned a lim-
ited number of pseudonyms that can quickly become a scarce
resource if changed frequently. Pseudonyms are thus costly
to acquire and use. Third, mix zones have a cost because
they impose limits on the services available to mobile users:
in order to protect against spatial correlation of location
traces, mix zones can conceal the trajectory of mobile nodes
by not allowing nodes in the mix zone to communicate [36].
Hence, the number of mix zones traversed by mobile nodes
must be kept small. Finally, even if the distributed solution
synchronizes pseudonym changes, it does not align incen-
tives between mobile nodes: because the achieved location
privacy depends on both the node density and the unpre-
dictability of node movements in mix zones [7], a selﬁsh
mobile node might decide to not change its pseudonym in
settings oﬀering low location privacy guarantees.
In contrast with existing approaches, we consider selﬁsh
mobile nodes that locally decide whether to change their
pseudonyms or not. With this paradigm shift, we tackle
one of the main issues that to date has hindered the use
of multiple pseudonym schemes. Although selﬁsh behavior
can reduce the cost of location privacy based on multiple
pseudonyms, it can also jeopardize the welfare achieved with
a location privacy scheme. Hence, we investigate whether
the multiple pseudonym approach achieves location privacy
in non-cooperative scenarios.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst to
investigate the game-theoretic aspects of location privacy
in mobile networks. We propose the ﬁrst user-centric loca-
tion privacy model to capture the evolution of the location
privacy level of mobile nodes over time. Mobile nodes mea-
sure with the model their location privacy level in order to
determine when to change pseudonyms. We deﬁne a game-
theoretic model - the pseudonym change game - that models
the decisions of mobile nodes in a mix zone. We ﬁrst analyze
the game with complete information (i.e., every node knows
the user-centric location privacy level of other nodes) and
we obtain both pure and mixed Nash equilibria [44]. We
show that nodes should coordinate their strategies: nodes
should either cooperate when there is a suﬃcient number of
neighbors with low privacy, or defect. Then, because mobile
nodes will in general not have good knowledge of the pay-
oﬀs of other nodes, we study, using a Bayesian approach [30],
the incomplete information scenario. We evaluate both the-
oretically and numerically the game model, and derive the
Bayesian Nash equilibria for a class of threshold strategies
in which nodes decide whether to change their pseudonym
based on comparing their privacy level to a threshold value.
We ﬁnd a symmetric equilibrium, in which all nodes coop-
erate with the same probability, as determined with respect
to a distribution over privacy levels. We compare the game-
theoretic approach with random and socially-optimal strate-
gies and show that using the Bayesian Nash equilibrium,
players reduce their consumption of pseudonyms while still
achieving high location privacy. Finally, we design the Pseu-
doGame protocol that implements the pseudonym change
game. This paper is part of the recent trend of blending
game theory with security/cryptographic mechanisms when
selﬁsh parties are involved [10, 29, 38, 39, 45, 47].
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss
the state of the art of location privacy and the economics of
privacy. In Section 3, we present the system and threat mod-
els considered throughout the paper. In Section 4, we pro-
pose the user-centric location privacy model. In Section 5,
we present the game model that we then investigate with
complete information in Section 6 and incomplete informa-
tion in Section 7. In Section 8 we describe the pseudonym
change game protocol. We conclude the paper in Section 9.
2. RELATED WORK
Previous works on location privacy [6, 34, 42] show that
the adversary can implicitly obtain the true identity of the
owner of a mobile node from the analysis of its location. For
example, using location traces collected in an oﬃce environ-
ment from the Active Bat system, Beresford and Stajano [6]
correctly identify all participants by simply examining where
the participants spent most of their time. Similarly, using
GPS traces from vehicles, two studies by Hoh et al. [34] and
Krumm [42] ﬁnd the home (and thus the identity) of most
drivers.
Hence, pseudonyms are not suﬃcient to protect the loca-
tion privacy of mobile nodes and should be changed over
time to avoid such attacks. But even if location traces
of mobile nodes do not contain any pseudonyms, Hoh and
Gruteser [32] are able to reconstruct the tracks of mobile
nodes using a multiple target tracking (MTT) algorithm.
Hence, location traces should also be altered spatially. In
other words, the spatial and temporal correlation between
successive locations of mobile nodes must be carefully elim-
inated to prevent external parties from compromising their
location privacy. In this paper, location privacy is achieved
by changing pseudonyms in regions called mix zones [6],
where the location of mobile nodes cannot be eavesdropped.
Note that mobile nodes make use of long-term identiﬁers,
such as MAC (Medium Access Control) addresses, to com-
municate on the data link. For example, in IEEE 802.11,
the MAC addresses are 48-bit values included in frames to
identify the source or destination of a frame. MAC addresses
can be anonymized to serve uniquely for short term commu-
nications. To do so, one approach [27] consists in changing
the MAC address every time a pseudonym is changed. An-
other possibility [26] is to obscure the MAC address and use
an identiﬁer-free link layer protocol.
Similarly, it is possible to identify devices relying on their
325distinctive characteristics (i.e., ﬁngerprints) at the physical,
link and application layer. At the physical layer, the wireless
transceiver has a wireless ﬁngerprint that can identify wire-
less devices in the long term using modulation-based tech-
niques [8], transient-based techniques [19], amplitude-based
techniques [53] or a combination of features [28, 46]. How-
ever, these techniques are only evaluated with speciﬁc tech-
nologies and countermeasures could be developed. Hence,
in mobile networks, it remains unclear how much identify-
ing information can be extracted from the physical layer. At
the link layer, it is possible to distinguish between a number
of devices and drivers [21]. At the application layer, devices
can also be identiﬁed based on clock skews [40]. However,
such techniques require an active adversary and can be coun-
tered by ignoring the requests sent by the adversary. Sim-
ilarly, a reduction of the diﬀerences between drivers would
limit the eﬀectiveness of such attacks. Note that indepen-
dently from the presence of ﬁngerprinting attacks, higher
layer privacy mechanisms such as mix zones remain useful.
Some applications may, for example, require keeping loca-
tion traces for a while (e.g., for congestion analysis).
There are several techniques, besides the multiple pseu-
donym approach, to achieve location privacy. Group sig-
natures [16] allow a group member to sign on behalf of a
group without revealing the identity of the signer. The main
drawback of group signatures is that they require a group
manager to add and revoke group members. The size of
the group determines the achieved privacy of its member.
Similarly, Ring signatures [49] allow mobile nodes to sign on
behalf of an ad hoc group of nodes without the help of a
central coordinator. However, the location privacy provided
by ring signatures is still an open problem [23]. Anonymous
credential systems (e.g., Idemix [12]) allow mobile nodes to
anonymously authenticate to third parties, with the help of
an online credential issuer. The online availability of a cre-
dential issuer is often not possible in wireless networks. To
circumvent the issue, techniques based on unclonable iden-
tiﬁers, such as e-tokens [13], allow nodes to anonymously
authenticate themselves a given number of times per pe-
riod. However, such techniques do not work in the case of a
prolonged absence of the credential issuer.
Game theory has been used to evaluate the strategic be-
havior of mobile nodes in ad hoc networks for node revoca-
tion [47]. It has also been used to study privacy. Acquisti [5]
explores the reasons decentralized anonymity infrastructures
are still not in wide use today. Varian [54] depicts the role
of privacy in economic transactions, showing that because
of the advantages of price discrimination, consumers may be
less inclined to protect their privacy. In this paper, we study
a new aspect of privacy by evaluating how privacy can be
achieved among non-cooperative nodes.
3. PRELIMINARIES
We focus exclusively on peer-to-peer communications be-
tween nodes and do not consider communications with the
infrastructure (such as cellular networks or WLAN).
3.1 System Model
We study a network where mobile nodes are autonomous
entities equipped with WiFi or Bluetooth-enabled devices
that communicate with each other upon coming in range. In
other words, we describe a pervasive communication system
(a mobile ad hoc network) such as a vehicular network [31],
a delay tolerant network [20], or a network of directly com-
municating hand-held devices [1, 2, 3] in which mobile nodes
in proximity automatically exchange information.
As commonly assumed in such networks, we consider an
oﬄine Certiﬁcation Authority (CA) run by an independent
trusted third party that pre-establishes the credentials for
the devices. In line with the multiple pseudonym approach
to protect location privacy, we assume that prior to entering
the network, every mobile node i registers with the CA that
preloads a set of M public/private key pairs {P ubk
i }M
k=1
to provide veriﬁcation and signature functionalities, respec-
tively. Note that the CA veriﬁes the identity of each user
upon registration. A public key P ubk
i serves as the identiﬁer
of node i and is referred to as its pseudonym. The private
key P rvk
i enables node i to digitally sign messages, and the
digital certiﬁcate validates the signature authenticity.
i , P rvk
We consider a discrete time system with initial time t = 0.
At each time step t, mobile nodes move in the network. We
assume that mobile nodes automatically exchange informa-
tion (unbeknownst to their users) as soon as they are in com-
munication range of each other. Note that our evaluation
is independent from the communication protocol. Still, we
align our communication model with common assumptions
of pervasive communication systems: mobile nodes advertise
their presence by periodically broadcasting proximity bea-
cons (e.g., every 100ms over a range of 300m in vehicular
networks) containing the node’s authenticating information
(as well as the position and speed in vehicular networks).
Due to the broadcast nature of wireless communications,
beacons enable mobile nodes to discover their neighbors.
When a node i receives a beacon, it controls the legitimacy
of the sender by checking the certiﬁcate of the public key of
the sender. After this, i veriﬁes the signature of the beacon
message. Subsequently, if conﬁdentiality is required, a se-
curity association is established (e.g., with Diﬃe-Hellman).
Note that there is ongoing work in the literature [11, 14] to
