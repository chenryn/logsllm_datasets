The WoC side-effects: alert fatigue
“Alert fatigue is the single biggest problem we 
have right now … We need to be more intelligentabout our alerts or we’ll all go insane.”
- John Vincent (#monitoringsucks)
Watching screens cannot scale + it’s useless
Human brains are good at detecting patterns
Even subtle ones
Computers suck at it
OTOH, humans get lost in volume and details
Current IT fire fighting situation

Need the cognitive equivalent of THIS!
19
But NOT necessarily turn things over completely to 	the machines!Synergy? (I KNEW I could sneak that word in!)
• Challenge:
	– Can we have the machines do the high volume drudge work 	and allow the humans to exercise judgement and high level 	reasoning?

Enter Machine Learning!

Types of Learning
Supervised Learning
 In ML, Supervised Learning is the general set of techniques for inferring a model from a set of observations:– Observations in a Training Set are labelled with the desired outcomes (e.g. 
	“normal vs. anomalous”, “normal vs. fraudulent”, “red/green/yellow”, etc)– As observations are fed into the learning system, it learns to differentiate by 	inferring a model based on these labels
– Once sufficiently “trained”, the system is used in production on “real” 	unlabelled data and can label the new data based on the inferred modelSupervised Learning example
Unsupervised Learning
 In Unsupervised Learning, the system is tasked with inferring a model without having access to a set of labeled examples– Much harder in general
– Well-suited to tasks where data labeling is not possible or practical: 	clustering, self-driving cars J
Unsupervised Learning example
Unsupervised Learning example
Reinforcement LearningReinforcement Learning
 • System is rewarded (or 
	punished) based on the 
	outcomes it generates
	– Action leads to a change in the 	state of the world and 
	generates an error score
Statistical Learning
 Machine Learning is not all about Neural Networks, Deep Learning,
Large portion of ML in practice today is statistical in nature:– Linear regression, logistic regression
– Three-sigma– Three-sigma
– Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
– Holt-Winters and exponential smoothing
– K-means, k-nearest neighbors
– Support Vector Machines
– Random trees, random forests
– …
Flavor of Statistical ML: 
Three Things to Remember for 
Anomaly Detection
46
Thing 1: 
Your data is NOT necessarily Gaussian
Gaussian or Normal distribution
 Bell-shaped distribution
– Has a mean and a standard deviation– Has a mean and a standard deviation
Can you tell?
THIS is normal
This isn’t
Neither is this
Normal distributions are really useful
 I can make powerful predictions because of the statistical properties of the data
I can easily compare different metrics since they have similar 
statistical properties
	There is a HUGE body of statistical work on parametric techniques 	for normally distributed dataNormally distributed vs Not
Normally distributed
• Most naturally occurring processes Not
• A LOT of your data
• Population height, IQ distributions 
(present company excepted of 
course)
• Widget sizes, weights in 
	manufacturing
• …

Why is that important?
|  | Most analytics tools are based on two assumptions: | Most analytics tools are based on two assumptions: | Most analytics tools are based on two assumptions: ||---|---|---|---|
|  |1. |1. |Data is normally distributed with a useful and  |
|  |usable mean and standard deviation |usable mean and standard deviation |usable mean and standard deviation |
|  |2. |Data is probabilistically “stationary” |Data is probabilistically “stationary” |
Example: Three-Sigma Rule
 Three-sigma rule
– ~68% of the values lie within 1 std deviation of the mean– ~95% of the values lie within 2 std deviations
– 99.73% of the values lie within 3 std deviations: anything 
else is considered an outlier

Doesn’t work because THIS

Holt-Winters predictions
Histogram – probability distribution
Or worse, THIS!

Histogram – probability distribution
Thing 2 
	Saying Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
is a great way to impress everyone
Why is that important?
 Seriously!?
Ok, actually non-parametric techniques that make no assumptions about normality or any other probability distribution are crucial in 
your effort to understand what’s going on in your systemsParametric vs Non-Parametric Learning
 Parametric learning:
– Finite, manageable number of parameters
– Makes strong assumptions about the data (e.g. Gaussian distribution)– Example: Linear Regression
Non-Parametric:
– Large (or infinite) number of parameters
– No assumptions about the underlying characteristics of the data– Example: Kolmogorov-Smirnov
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
|  | Non-parametric test|  | Non-parametric test
– Compare two probability  | 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmo |
|---|---|---|
|  |	distributions – Makes no assumptions (e.g.  | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmo |
|  |	Gaussian) about the  	distributions of the samples– Measures maximum  | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmo |
|  |distance between  cumulative distributions | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmo ||  |– Can be used to compare 	periodic/seasonal metric  | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmo |
|  |periods (e.g. day-to-day or week-to-week) | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmo |

KS with windowing
Data from similar windows
Cumulative distribution for those windows
Data from dissimilar windowsData from dissimilar windows

Thing 3: 
Take Scope and Context 
into account!
Some data – is that normal?
Wider scope
Is this an anomlay?
Even wider scope
Is every weekend an anomaly?
Would this be more accurate?
Use domain knowledge!
 Domain knowledge is NOT a bad thing!Domain knowledge is NOT a bad thing!
– There is no algorithm that will work on everything– Know your data and it general patterns 
	ê Periodicity/Seasonality 
	ê Known events (maintenance, backups, etc)
– Apply the appropriate algorithms, taking into account enough scope for any 	inherent periodicity to appear
– Customize your alerts to take into accounts known events

Key Takeaways
 Machine Learning is an evolution in the tools available to us
ML is not one thing, it’s many different types of things that can be applied to different types of problemsML applications and techniques vary so like any other tool, it helps to use the right tool for the right problem space
When it comes to statistical learning
– Your data is probably (heh) not Gaussian
– You should try and say Komogorov-Smirnov
– Take context into account when leveraging ML tools
