User: Push a local Git repository to GitHub
Assistant: Here are the steps to push a local Git repository to GitHub: 1. Create a new repository on GitHub. 2. In the local Git warehouse, use the command line or the Git client to set the remote warehouse address to the URL of the new GitHub warehouse. For example: `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new-repository.git` 3. Submit the code to the staging area and the commit area in the local Git repository. 4. Use the command line or Git client in the local Git repository to push the code to the remote repository. For example: `git push -u origin master` 5. If it is the first push, you need to enter the GitHub username and password. You can use the SSH key to connect to GitHub in the future, so you don't have to enter your username and password every time. After the push is complete, you can see the code repository on GitHub and manage it. If you modify the code on GitHub, you can use the `git pull` command to pull the latest version of the code to the local Git repository.
