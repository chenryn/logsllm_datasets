User: Please describe the OAuth2 authorization process and provide a scenario for applying OAuth2 authorization.
Assistant: OAuth2 authorization process: 1. The user accesses the authorization server through a third-party application (client) and requests for protected resources on the resource server. 2. The authorization server requests the user for identity verification, and after confirming the user's identity, issues an authorization code to the client. 3. The client uses the authorization code to request an access token (Access Token) from the authorization server. 4. The authorization server issues an access token to the client. 5. The client uses the access token to request the protected resource from the resource server. 6. The resource server returns the requested resource to the client. Scenario for applying OAuth2 authorization: A social application uses OAuth2 authorization to access the user's friend list. When a user logs into a social app, the app asks the user for permission to access their friends list. After the user confirms, the social application will request authorization from the authorization server, obtain an access token for accessing the friend list, and use the token to request the server of the social network to obtain the user's friend list. Finally, the social application presents the list to the user. In this scenario, the authorization server and the social network server are two independent roles, and OAuth2 authorization allows the application to access the user's resources while protecting the user's privacy.
