User: I'm working on an app that communicates with Google App Engine to update and retrieve user information, but I can't think of a way to modify elements in the datastore.
For example, every user for my app is represented by a User object in the datastore. If this user inputs things like email, phone number, etc into fields inside the iPhone application, I want to be able to update those objects in the datastore. The datastore can be in Java or Python, I'm just looking for an idea that will work.
Thanks
Assistant: Why not have the iPhone application communicate this information to app engine by making a simple HTTP request?
Specifically, I would do an HTTP POST to the server and include the relevant fields.  Then your app engine request handler would simply store the information in the datastore.
