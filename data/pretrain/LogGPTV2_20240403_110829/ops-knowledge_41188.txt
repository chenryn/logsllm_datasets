User: I've seen other similar questions but none of the solutions are working for me. I am trying to get Twilio working with Google App Engine. I am using the python API and can't seem to get it to work. I tried a few tactics: 

used pip install twilio
downloaded the twilio file directly into my root directory
sym linked the required files according to a few tutorials 

nothing seems to work. When I write the line "import twilio.twiml" it makes the google app engine crash and say "error: server error: 
What is the best way to import Twilio and load into the google app engine server?
Assistant: Thanks for the input. I had already tried all of these things. When I ran the app on a local host I saw in the console that the error I was facing was with 'pytz' 
Turns out that Twilio requires the Pytz dependency to be in the root directory of Google App Engine. They have not updated the documentation yet. 
Hope that helps anyone in the future.
