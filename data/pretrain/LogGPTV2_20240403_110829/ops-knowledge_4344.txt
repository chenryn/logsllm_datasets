User: Please explain what is a RESTful API, its design principles and benefits.
Assistant: RESTful API is a design style of web application program interface based on HTTP protocol, which adopts a set of well-defined rules and constraints to realize communication between different applications. Design principles of RESTful API: 1. Focus on resources. Resource is the core concept of API, and all interface design should be around resource. The resource is uniquely identified by the URI, and the resource is operated by the HTTP method. 2. Use HTTP verbs to express operations. Verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE correspond to operations such as adding, deleting, modifying, and checking. The HTTP status code indicates the result of the operation. 3. Use standard formats to pass data. RESTful API requires data to be delivered in standard formats, such as JSON, XML, etc. 4. No state. The API should be stateless, i.e. each request is independent of each other and each request should contain enough information for the server to understand. Advantages of RESTful API: 1. Good scalability. The API takes resources as the core and can be expanded more flexibly. Adding new resources only needs to add resource identifiers, without affecting the use of existing resources. 2. High readability. Since RESTful APIs operate using HTTP methods and URIs, the meaning of each request can be easily understood and predicted. 3. Strong cross-platform compatibility. Data is delivered in a standard format that can be interpreted and used by any platform. 4. High security. The RESTful API uses the HTTP secure transmission protocol and supports encryption protocols such as SSL to ensure the security of data transmission.
