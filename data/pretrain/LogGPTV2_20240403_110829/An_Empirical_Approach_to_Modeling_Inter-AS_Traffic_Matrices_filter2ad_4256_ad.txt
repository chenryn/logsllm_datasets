these regions by incumbent telecom carriers. Since the ISP
market in the Asia-Paciﬁc countries, in particular, is highly
regulated by the government, it is to be expected that the
entire ISP business in this region is dominated by a few
large telecom carriers. In the North American region, on
the other hand, the correlation between “residential access”
and “business access” is relatively low, reﬂecting a less reg-
ulated environment.
5 Inter-AS Trafﬁc Demand Model
The proposed trafﬁc demand model builds on our AS busi-
ness characterization by using as key input the ASs’ in-
ferred utility proﬁles (i.e., Uweb, URA and UBA). We show
how the new model can be used in conjunction with a given
AS graph to generate realistic inter-domain trafﬁc demand.
5.1 Modeling Framework
For describing inter-domain trafﬁc demands, we postulate a
general gravity model (see for example [23] and references
therein), where trafﬁc ﬂow from body i to body j (denoted
Xij) is assumed to satisfy
Xij ∝
Si × Tj
Fij
,
(1)
where:
• Si: repulsive factor associated with “leaving” i,
• Tj: attractive factor, “approaching” j,
• Fij: friction factor from i to j.
Si, Tj, and Fij are deﬁned appropriately for each environ-
ment under study. For example, in applying the model to
146
Internet Measurement Conference 2005
USENIX Association
urban transportation networks, Si and Tj typically repre-
sent the populations in areas i and j, with Fij being in gen-
eral a function of the distance between the two areas. When
applying the model in the context of modeling intra-domain
trafﬁc demand, Zhang et al. [23] take Si as the trafﬁc vol-
ume entering at location i and Tj as the amount of trafﬁc
exiting at location j, and assume a common friction fac-
tor Fij that does not depend on i and j [23]. They show
that this model works remarkably well and yields trafﬁc de-
mand that is consistent with measured intra-domain trafﬁc
volumes. To put the gravity model to good use for describ-
ing inter-domain trafﬁc demand, we need to deﬁne Si, Tj,
and Fij within our context so as to reﬂect the speciﬁcs the
Internet’s AS environment.
Repulsive, attractive factors. We assume that a ma-
jority of inter-domain trafﬁc in today’s Internet can be at-
tributed to two kinds of interactions: (i) communication
between web servers and clients (called “web” trafﬁc),
and (ii) communication between two clients (called “inter-
residential” trafﬁc). Web surﬁng and media streaming be-
long to the ﬁrst category, Email and ﬁle sharing belong to
the second category.
A typical web transaction is an asymmetric two-way
communication: client’s request for web resource, and the
corresponding response from the server. Thus, web traf-
ﬁc from AS i to AS j can be attributed to either a server
in AS i returning web content requested by a client in AS
j, or a client in AS i sending a request for web content
served by a server in AS j. In the context of the gravity
model, we model the volume of web trafﬁc as a function
of an AS’s client population size and web content popu-
lation size. Let PRA(X) be the client population size of
AS X and Pweb(X) the web content population size of the
AS. The volume of “web” trafﬁc from AS i to AS j is then
quantitatively expressed as the weighted sum of two prod-
ucts: Pweb(i)·PRA(j)+κw·PRA(i)·Pweb(j). The ﬁrst term
corresponds to the “response” trafﬁc from AS i (of popu-
lation size Pweb(i)) to clients in AS j (of population size
PRA(j)). The second term corresponds to the “request”
trafﬁc from clients in AS i for web content in AS j. The
parameter κw is the ratio of request trafﬁc over response
trafﬁc, usually signiﬁcantly less than 1.
The symmetric inter-residential trafﬁc from AS i to AS j
is modeled as κr · PRA(i) · PRA(j). The parameter κr is a
normalization factor that determines the relative weight of
web trafﬁc and inter-residential trafﬁc. Combining web and
inter-residential trafﬁc, the total trafﬁc volume from AS i to
AS j can be estimated as: Pweb(i) · PRA(j) + κw · PRA(i) ·
Pweb(j) + κrPRA(i) · PRA(j).
A key factor in specifying our trafﬁc demand model
concerns the issue of modeling the quantities Pweb(·) and
PRA(·). However, as seen earlier in Section 4, the empiri-
cally derived quantities Uweb(·) and URA(·) are in fact esti-
mates of the population of web content and the population
of clients, respectively, and are thus natural drivers of our
gravity model. More generally, Pweb(i) and PRA(i) can be
modeled as f1(Rweb(i)) and f2(RRA(i)), where f1(·) and
f2(·) are monotonically decreasing rank-size functions; for
example, in the case where Uweb(·) follows roughly a type-
1 Pareto distribution, f1(x) = x−ω.
Friction factor. In urban transportation studies, the fric-
tion factor of the gravity model is typically a function of the
distance between two regions. In estimating intra-domain
trafﬁc demand using the gravity model, Zhang et al. [23]
assume a common, constant friction factor.
In the inter-
AS environment, such an assumption may not be realistic.
For example, an over-provisioned path between two ASs
may increase trafﬁc ﬂow between them, whereas an under-
provisioned path is likely to decrease trafﬁc ﬂow between
them.
Based on this observation, we deﬁne the friction factor
between AS i and AS j as RBA(i, j)β, where RBA(i, j) =
max{RBA(X) | X ∈ path(i, j), X 6= i, j} and path(i, j)
denotes the set of transit ASs in the path between AS i
and AS j. As deﬁned in the previous section, RBA(X)
is the rank of AS X among all business access providers.
RBA(i, j) is thus the maximum rank of a transit AS be-
tween AS i and AS j. Assuming that an AS with higher
transit rank is more likely to maintain a well-provisioned
network, this deﬁnition of the friction factor captures the
transit quality of the bottleneck AS of a given path. By
tuning the parameter β, we can study the sensitivity of traf-
ﬁc demand as a function of the transit network quality (a
smaller β means lower variability in transit quality).
Remarks: Note that the original gravity model postu-
lates that interactions between nodes are independent. On
the one hand, this assumption seems reasonable for model-
ing highly aggregated quantities such as inter-domain traf-
ﬁc ﬂows, where the latter are, in general, sufﬁciently ag-
gregated so that possible dependencies among ﬁner-grained
trafﬁc ﬂows can be safely ignored. On the other hand, by
deﬁning the friction factor in terms of RBA(·), we may
introduce subtle dependencies among inter-domain trafﬁc
ﬂows, as RBA(X) is not independent of RBA(Y ) if X is a
downstream customer of Y , or vice versa. In this sense, the
proposed “general gravity model” is not a gravity model in
the strict sense, but allows for dependencies that may be
genuine at the Internet’s AS level, where inter-dependent
trafﬁc engineering is not uncommon.
5.2 Generation of Inter-AS Trafﬁc Demand
Given an AS graph with N nodes and using the above grav-
ity model, we can express the trafﬁc demand from i to j as
Xij ∼
Tw(i, j) + κr · Tr(i, j)
RBA(i, j)β
,
(2)
where
USENIX Association
Internet Measurement Conference 2005

• Tw(i, j) = f1(Rweb(i)) · f2(RRA(j)) + κw ·
f2(RRA(i)) · f1(Rweb(j)), and
• Tr(i, j) = f2(RRA(i)) · f2(RRA(j)).
To produce the resulting inter-domain trafﬁc demand
matrix, we ﬁrst generate for each node (AS X) in the
graph its rankings in terms of the three utilities we iden-
tiﬁed ( ˆRweb(X), ˆRRA(X), ˆRBA(X)). When generating
these rank vectors, we must account for the pairwise cor-
relation between the rankings as reported in Section 4.
By deﬁnition, the ranking ˆRBA(·) is determined solely by
the topology of a given graph. Given a graph, ˆRBA(·)
can be computed independent of the other two rankings.
Using ˆRBA(·) as an anchor, we next generate ˆRweb(·)
and ˆRRA(·) based on a well-known method for generat-
ing multi-variate normal random numbers [18]. Our rank
generation algorithm is described in Table 9. The input pa-
rameters to our algorithm are the AS graph and a 3 × 3 rank
correlation matrix Στ = {τij}.

6 Toward Model Validations
Recall that our empirical approach to determining the in-
put data (i.e., utility proﬁle-based AS business models) that
drives the gravity model proposed in Section 5 is based
exclusively on publicly obtainable/available data sets and
does not use any actual trafﬁc volume measurements. Thus
a natural starting point for attempting to validate many as-
pects of our inter-domain trafﬁc demand model is to gain
access to trafﬁc volume-related AS-speciﬁc data sets which
are in general not publicly available. We follow this strat-
egy by relying on a week’s worth of (sampled) NetFlow
measurements from a regional ISP. The data sets were
collected from one of its access routers around the same
time when we performed our own measurement experi-
ments described in Section 3 (i.e., Oct. 2004). The cap-
tured trafﬁc originates from or is destined to the ISP’s net-
works, and the data sets contain, among other information,
source/destination IP address preﬁxes of length at most 24
(due to anonymization), source/destination port numbers,
and size of each trafﬁc ﬂow. We use these actual traf-
ﬁc measurements (i) to check a basic assumption under-
lying our gravity model, namely that the inter-domain traf-
ﬁc demand is determined by “web” and “inter-residential”
trafﬁc, (ii) to explore the adequacy of our key decision to
use “surrogate” trafﬁc measurements (e.g., data measuring
the appearance of web content in search results, estimates
for the number of P2P ﬁle-sharing users) instead of ac-
tual trafﬁc volume estimates, and (iii) to provide a prelim-
inary comparison between actual inter-domain trafﬁc de-
mand and those generated by our model.
6.1 Trafﬁc Classiﬁcation
To check the assumption explicit in Equation (2) that inter-
AS trafﬁc demand consists of the two components, “web”
trafﬁc and “inter-residential” trafﬁc, we classify the ﬂows
in our NetFlow data set into “web” trafﬁc and “inter-
residential” trafﬁc, using an up-to-date list of well-known
port numbers. Given a trafﬁc ﬂow, if either source or desti-
nation port number is assigned to well-known web service
(e.g., http, nntp, streaming), the ﬂow is marked as “web”
trafﬁc. If either source or destination port number is asso-
ciated with a well-known P2P ﬁle sharing application, the
ﬂow is marked as “inter-residential” trafﬁc. However, an
increasing number of applications do not use well-known
port numbers, which makes it difﬁcult to fully identify net-
work trafﬁc type based on port numbers alone. To improve
upon the above naive trafﬁc classiﬁcation, for ﬂows we
cannot identify by source/destination port pair, we exam-
ine their source and destination address preﬁxes to heuris-
tically infer its application type. More speciﬁcally, we ran-
domly choose two IP addresses, one from each the source
address preﬁx and destination address preﬁx, and perform
a reverse DNS lookup.
If either one of them has web-
service related domain names (e.g., www* or web*), then
we mark the ﬂow as “web” trafﬁc.
If both IP addresses
are resolved to well-known residential network domains
(e.g., reshall.umich.edu or comcast.net), we mark the ﬂow
as “inter-residential” trafﬁc.
Table 10 reports our trafﬁc classiﬁcation result. The re-
ported percentages are based on total volumes of trafﬁc.
Although applying our heuristic reduces the amount of un-
known trafﬁc by 8%, uncategorized trafﬁc still accounts for

one-third of all trafﬁc, consistent with other available num-
bers [4]. We thus observe that with currently available traf-
ﬁc classiﬁcation methods, our model appears to capture at
least two thirds of actual inter-AS trafﬁc. Improvements of
state-of-the-art trafﬁc classiﬁcation techniques (e.g., [11])
can be expected to show a more accurate coverage of inter-
AS trafﬁc by our model.
6.2 Measurement Methodologies
Our methodology described in Section 3 for inferring an
AS’s utility proﬁle and determining in turn its business
model avoids on purpose actual trafﬁc volume-related mea-
surements. Instead, we rely on “surrogate” trafﬁc measure-
ments such as appearances of web content in search results
or estimates of an AS’s P2P ﬁle sharing population and as-
sume that the latter are viable substitutes for the largely
inaccessible actual trafﬁc data. To check this assumption,
we rely again on our NetFlow data sets and extract from
them three distinct trafﬁc volume measurements for each
AS X: Tweb(X), TRA(X), and TBA(X), which corre-
spond to “web-hosting” trafﬁc, “residential access” trafﬁc,
and “business access” trafﬁc, respectively. Using our clas-
siﬁcation of trafﬁc in Section 6.1 into “web” and “inter-
residential” trafﬁc. we compute Tweb(·) and TRA(·), as de-
scribed in Table 11.
Table 11: Computation of Tweb(·) and TRA(·)
Tweb(·) = TRA(·) = 0 for every AS.
for each trafﬁc ﬂow f,
if f is web trafﬁc,
let X = web hosting AS for f
let Y = client AS for f
Tweb(X) = Tweb(X) + size(f )
TRA(Y ) = TRA(Y ) + size(f )
else if f is inter-residential trafﬁc,
let X = client AS 1 for f
let Y = client AS 2 for f
TRA(X) = TRA(X) + size(f )
TRA(Y ) = TRA(X) + size(f )
The “business-access” trafﬁc TBA(X) captures the vol-
ume of trafﬁc going through AS X. To compute TBA(X),
we use Gao’s heuristics [10] to construct an AS-level rout-
ing path for each source-destination pair. We then in-
crement TBA(·) of every transit AS between the source-
destination pair by the size of each ﬂow.
Fig. 4 shows how well our inferred utilities (i.e., Uweb,
URA and UBA) compare to their actual trafﬁc-derived
counterparts (i.e., Tweb, TRA and TBA). We observe that
in all three cases, ASs with high inferred utilities also have
high measured trafﬁc volumes. In Table 12, we quantify
the pairwise correlation of Tweb, TRA, TBA, just as we did
earlier in Table 8 with the inferred utilities Uweb, URA, and
UBA. Comparing Tables 8 and 12, we note that the pair-
wise correlation values are slightly underestimated by our
methodologies, more so in the North American region than
in the other regions. Overall, while the actual values differ,
the generally low degree of pairwise correlations in Tweb,
TRA, and TBA is consistent with what we observed earlier
for the inferred utilities Uweb, URA, and UBA, which sug-
gests that our assumption of using appropriate “surrogate”
trafﬁc measurements instead of actual trafﬁc measurements
is not obviously unreasonable. However, there is clearly
room for signiﬁcant improvements.
6.3 Trafﬁc Demand Model
Ultimately, any inter-domain trafﬁc demand model will be
judged by how well the results compare to actual Internet
data.
In our attempt to provide such an initial compari-
son, we check whether our model, when combined with an
inferred Internet AS graph and when appropriately param-
eterized, is capable of generating realistic trafﬁc demand,
consistent with actual demand measured in the Internet. To
this end, we use an inferred Internet AS graph consisting
of 18,221 nodes and 39,558 edges, and since our NetFlow
data sets were collected from a single vantage point on
the Internet, we compare model-generated trafﬁc demand
of a single source node against NetFlow trafﬁc informa-
tion, where the source node is chosen to be an AS S that
has a business model comparable to that of the AS from
which the NetFlow measurements were collected. We also
present some preliminary result concerning the sensitivity
of the generated inter-domain trafﬁc matrix to the choice of
model parameters.
Given the Internet-like pairwise rank correlation (i.e., τij
taken from the “All” column of Table 8), we assign ranks
to each node based the method described in Section 5.2,
considering the special case where the quantities Pweb(·)
and PRA(·) are given by type-1 Pareto distributions, i.e.,
Pweb(X) = Rweb(X)−ω and PRA(X) = RRA(X)−ρ,
with ω, ρ > 0. Using this model, we then generate the
trafﬁc demand TX that each node X maintains with our
