Assistant: According to the company's business characteristics, a dual-room disaster recovery solution can be designed to ensure high data availability and business continuity. The scheme is as follows: 1. Select two computer rooms that are geographically far apart to ensure that the impact of the data center is minimized in the case of natural disasters or regional failures. 2. Set up active and standby server clusters in the two computer rooms respectively, and connect the main machine and the standby machine through a high-speed network to realize data mirroring backup and real-time data synchronization. 3. Configure a monitoring system to monitor the status of the main machine and the standby machine. When the main machine is abnormal, the business traffic will be automatically switched to the standby machine to ensure business continuity. 4. Configure active and standby network channels between computer rooms, such as dual computer room interconnection, cross-computer room VPN, etc., to achieve network intercommunication and ensure high data availability and business continuity. 5. Regularly conduct data backup and recovery tests to ensure the reliability and recovery speed of backup data. By building a dual-computer room disaster recovery system, high availability of data and business continuity can be achieved, and the company will not lose data or interrupt business in the case of natural disasters or regional failures, ensuring the long-term stable development of the company .
