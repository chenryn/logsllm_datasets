We have the following code:
    require('web-frame').setSpellCheckProvider("en-US", false, {
      spellCheck: function (word) {
        // the spell checking mechanism
      }
    });
  * `isn't` gets wrong highlighting when: 
    * spellCheck have been called with `isn` and we return `false`
    * spellCheck have been called with `isn't` and we return `true`
The only way to get correct highlighting for `isn't` is to return true in both
cases. However, `isn` is not a correct word so this is somewhat hacky. The
same applies for `doesn't`, 'aren't`, 'didn't`, 'wasn't`, etc...
With the current implementation it is also not possible to make an URL or
email address valid because the `spellCheck` callback is called individually
for `http`, `the-website` and `com`.

Solutions for these problems would be to call `spellCheck` callback only when
a `Space` have been entered.
