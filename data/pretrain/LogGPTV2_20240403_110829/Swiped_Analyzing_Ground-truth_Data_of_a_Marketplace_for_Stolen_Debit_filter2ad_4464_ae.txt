In this case, we would expect non-EMV accounts to have rel-
atively little time remaining until their expiration date when
they were added to the shop. Indeed, in 2016, the median re-
maining lifespan of non-EMV accounts was 1.2 years shorter
than for EMV accounts. From 2016 to 2018, however, the
median remaining lifespan of non-EMV accounts increased
by about 100 days; the non-EMV population was getting
younger, whereas EMV accounts aged by the same amount.
(Figure 13 in the appendix shows a box plot of the remain-
ing lifespans from 2016 to 2018.) This suggests that new
non-EMV cards continued to be issued after the liability shift.
Table 4 shows the percentage of EMV support among the
accounts of the ten largest U.S. issuers. For accounts added
to the shop before the liability shift, EMV capability ranged
from 18% (USAA Savings Bank) to 72% (American Ex-
press). Issuers progressed at a different pace during the next
Figure 11: U.S. magnetic stripe inventory by its cumula-
tive weekly purchase status, for EMV (above) and non-EMV
accounts (below). Weekly EMV supply was signiﬁcantly
larger than purchases, leading to an accumulation of unsold
accounts. In contrast, non-EMV accounts were purchased at
a rate similar to new supply; available inventory effectively
shrunk due to older accounts reaching their expiration dates.
14 months, with EMV support between 58 and 94%. In 2018
and 2019, around three years after the liability shift, each
of these large issuers had reached levels of 91 to 100% of
EMV capability. Small and medium-size issuers collectively
started from lower EMV capability rates of 5.8% and 13%,
respectively, and reached 89% and 91% in 2018.
There was a clear difference in card types among EMV
and non-EMV accounts added to the shop after the liability
shift. The EMV-capable accounts were composed of 52.8%
credit, 46.5% non-prepaid debit, and 0.45% prepaid debit
cards. In contrast, only 23% of non-EMV accounts were
credit cards. The remainder were debit cards: 67.8% non-
prepaid and 9% prepaid debit. Prepaid debit cards appeared
to be issued predominantly without EMV capability; 77.4%
of prepaid debit cards added after the liability shift had no
chip. Anecdotally, we conﬁrmed that many prepaid debit
cards issued today do not support EMV. For example, we
found that 99.8% (9,559) of Green Dot-issued prepaid cards
added to the shop after the liability shift do not support EMV.
In summary, the transition to EMV progressed at a different
pace depending on the card issuer and card type, and had not
completed at the end of the dataset. Despite the progress in
deployment, EMV did not lead to a decrease in the availability
of stolen magnetic stripe data in the shop.

9 Marketplace Finances
Deterring proﬁt-motivated attackers is akin to disrupting a
business process. Thus, it is important to understand the
cost structure of this shop, and how the payment industry
could increase the shop’s operating costs to reduce proﬁtabil-
ity. Table 5 depicts the shop’s yearly sales revenue, seller
commissions, buyer refunds, and proﬁt margins as they are
visible in the leaked database. We do not have information on
operating costs such as website infrastructure, employees of
the shop, or advertising costs related to customer acquisition.
Therefore, the margins we compute are an upper estimate.
Operating Costs. The two main operating costs are commis-
sions paid to sellers, and refunds provided to buyers. The
shop monitored refund rates and adjusted refund policies to
maintain them at an average of 33% of gross revenue.
Commissions were paid to the seller as a percentage of
each non-refunded account sale. These commission rates
were negotiated individually with every seller. While the
average commission was 65.9%, larger sellers and especially
CNP sellers were able to negotiate higher commission rates
of up to 90%. Over time, the shop improved its bargaining
position with sellers, reducing average commission rates on a
total sales basis from 78.6% in 2015 down to 55.7% in 2018.
Margins. We estimate that the shop made an overall proﬁt of
up to $23.8 M, at a 23% margin. From 2016 to 2017, revenue
grew by 34.2%, which resulted in a proﬁt increase of $1.3 M
(23.2%). At the same time, the margin fell from 23% to
21% due to higher operating costs from increased refunds. In
2018, gross revenue increased by only 4% ($1.3 M). All of
this increase was from growing CNP sales; magnetic stripe
sales decreased slightly by 0.3% ($92 k). Despite this small
increase in revenue from 2017 to 2018, the shop was able

to increase proﬁts by $2.3 M (33.8%) as a result of reducing
costs through lower seller commissions and refund rates.
The growth opportunity for the shop appeared to be in
CNP sales, while magnetic stripe sales remained the primary
source of revenue. A stagnant supply of CNP accounts, and a
steep decline in magnetic stripe supply or demand, possibly
by improved EMV adoption, might force the shop to reduce
costs further, and could ultimately erode its proﬁtability.
10 Discussion and Implications
The shop has created a scalable and lucrative model for selling
stolen accounts. Several measures were aimed at maintaining
the reputation of the marketplace and the loyalty of customers.
During the last months of the dataset, the shop added hun-
dreds of thousands of stolen accounts per week. Despite the
introduction of EMV chip cards, the shop accumulated an
oversupply of newly stolen magnetic stripe data in the three
years following the payment industry’s liability shift towards
merchants processing magnetic stripe transactions; the sup-
ply was so large that only 40% of the shop’s inventory was
purchased. Breaches of PoS systems appear to have become
common events, and the risk of magnetic stripe data being
stolen when a card is swiped is non-trivial. It appears that the
liability shift alone has not been sufﬁcient to disincentivize
merchants from swiping EMV-enabled cards and curb the
supply of stolen magnetic stripe data. Further disincentives
could include increased fees for processing magnetic stripe
payments, and liability for breached merchants. If the pay-
ment industry fails to agree on more effective self-regulation,
government regulation might ultimately be necessary.
A 2018 study from the U.S. Federal Reserve estimated
a decline of 20.9% ($770 M) in card-present fraud, and a
34.4% ($1.2 B) increase in card-not-present fraud after the
U.S. adoption of EMV chip technology [7]. Yet, from the
perspective of the shop’s ﬁnances, EMV had not caused a
major impact (yet). Carders continued to spend millions of
dollars to purchase magnetic stripe accounts in the years
after the U.S. deployed EMV, suggesting that EMV had not
(yet) signiﬁcantly impaired their ability to conduct fraud with
stolen magnetic stripe data.

Buyer preferences, however, did exhibit a noticeable impact
from EMV. Magnetic stripe data stolen from cards equipped
with a chip appeared to be less desirable than data from chip-
less cards. This suggests that carders perceived fraudulent
magnetic stripe transactions as less likely to succeed when the
data was stolen from EMV-enabled cards. Similarly, carders
appeared to perceive several U.S. banks, and many interna-
tional banks, as having weaker anti-fraud measures than other
banks. It is unfortunate that this “folk wisdom” is available to
carders, but not to the banks’ legitimate customers. This lack
of transparency enables each bank to make independent cost-
beneﬁt determinations for their anti-fraud measures, whereas
customers are left in the dark about the likelihood of encoun-
tering fraud with their payment cards. Requiring banks to
disclose quantitative fraud data could help customers make
informed decisions, and might incentivize underperforming
banks to improve their anti-fraud measures. More generally,
better information sharing among banks, and potentially more
centralized initiatives at the card network level, could also
help make fraud deterrents more uniform.
Carders also appeared to have a preference for prepaid
debit cards, which include gift cards, electronic beneﬁt trans-
fer (EBT) cards such as SNAP food beneﬁt cards, and payroll
cards for unbanked populations. Transaction risk scoring for
prepaid debit cards may be less accurate because issuers have
less information about account owners and their transaction
history. Furthermore, prepaid account owners may be less
likely to regularly check their statements and notice fraudulent
transactions. Despite these systemic difﬁculties in preventing
fraud, prepaid debit cards in the carder shop’s inventory had
a particularly high fraction of 77.4% not equipped with an
EMV chip. The data furthermore suggests that new cards
continued to be issued without a chip. For instance, nearly
all (99.8%) of the prepaid debit cards issued by Green Dot
did not support EMV, despite being added to the shop after
the liability shift. Issuers may consider the cost of EMV to be
higher than the fraud losses they and their customers might
have to bear. As an illustration, Scaife et al. quote a manufac-
turing cost of $2.00 for an EMV chip card as opposed to $0.08
for a magnetic stripe card [37]. Yet, the continued issuance
of non-EMV cards makes the goal of disallowing magnetic
stripe transactions elusive, and arguably holds back anti-fraud
progress in the entire industry. It would be worthwhile study-
ing whether holders of prepaid debit cards, which include
low-income populations, are less successful in detecting and
reverting fraudulent charges on their prepaid debit cards than
holders of regular debit and credit cards. Such a ﬁnding could
justify regulatory mandates for improved anti-fraud measures
in cases where economic considerations prevent issuers from
taking these measures voluntarily.
The EMV transition, and the prospect of magnetic stripe
supply eventually drying up may be a (distant) threat to the
shop. However, three years after the liability shift, the shop
still appeared to be prospering, and it is unclear on which
time horizon EMV might cause more pressing issues. Prior
work has reported on a trend of payment fraud migrating from
card-present to card-not-present transactions, presumably due
to EMV [7, 13]. The shop we studied had a relatively limited,
but highly demanded inventory of card-not-present accounts,
and appeared unable to secure a larger supply. This constraint
may eventually become a threat to this particular shop.
Limitations. Our study encompassed data leaked from a sin-
gle carder shop. While the scale of the data, such as the
inventory of over 19 M stolen accounts, and the gross revenue
of almost $104 M suggest that the shop played a signiﬁcant
role, it remains unclear how representative it was at the time
of the leak. In particular, we do not know whether supply con-
straints for CNP accounts translate to the entire ecosystem.
Another limitation is that the leaked data does not include
information about how accounts were initially stolen, or how
carders attempted to monetize them after purchase. We can-
not measure, for instance, whether the introduction of EMV
had an inﬂuence on expected fraud returns, or on the effort
necessary to cash out stolen magnetic stripe accounts.
Lastly, we have no absolute certainty that the leaked data
is authentic. However, due to our consistency checks along
with vetting by other companies, we are fairly conﬁdent that
it is authentic.
Future Work. We found that certain card issuers and types of
cards commanded higher underground prices or sold in higher
numbers; they were disproportionately being targeted for
fraud. However, as issuers update their anti-fraud measures,
these trends are likely to evolve. While we were able to
observe these trends in “ground-truth” back-end data, such
data is not commonly available, and it is an open question
how future trends could be identiﬁed without access to such
data. Future work could study whether such trends can be
