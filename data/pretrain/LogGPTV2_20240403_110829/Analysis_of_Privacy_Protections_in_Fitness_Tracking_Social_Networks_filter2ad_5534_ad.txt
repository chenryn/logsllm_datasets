### EPZ Radii and Accuracy

Strava allows for the configuration of various EPZ (Exclusion Privacy Zone) radii, which enables us to examine the impact of different radius sizes on the accuracy of our analysis. 

### Fuzzing EPZ Intersection Points

After removing points from each route that fall within the EPZ, we further remove points up to a random distance \( r_i \) past the intersection (as shown in Figure 8b), where \( 0 < r_i < F \). Initially, we set \( F \) to 80 meters, a value chosen to approximate the size of a city block.

This technique provides operational semantics similar to Ardagna et al.’s “shift center” obfuscation [27].

**Figure 9: Efficacy of Modify Radius Defense**  
- Larger EPZ radii seem to reduce attack accuracy, but they often envelop entire activities, leading to a decrease in observable routes.

### Spatial Cloaking

For each user, we randomly select a radius \( r' \) from the set of permissible EPZ radii on Strava, a random angle \( \theta \) ranging from 0 to 355 degrees in 5-degree increments, and a random value \( d \) where \( 0 < d < r' \). We then shift the center of the EPZ by distance \( d \) in the direction of \( \theta \). This ensures that the EPZ still covers the user’s protected location, but the location is at a random point within the EPZ rather than at the center. The value \( d \) is generated using a Planar Laplacian mechanism [26] to achieve ε-geo-indistinguishability, with \( \epsilon \) set to 1 and \( r \) set to \( r' \). Finally, we truncate all user activities such that no GPS coordinate falls within the enhanced EPZ.

### Countermeasure Evaluation

#### Modify Radius
- **Against this obfuscation:** We deployed our original EPZ identification attack as described in Section 3.
- **Results (Figure 9):** 
  - Our accuracy is 99% against 0.125-mile EPZs.
  - Our effectiveness drops to 46% against 0.625-mile EPZs.
- **Analysis:**
  - The drop in accuracy is not due to increased distance between endpoints and the protected location, but because larger radii often completely envelop the posted activity, making most activities invisible and reducing the utility of the fitness tracking service.

#### Fuzz EPZ Intersection Points
- **Against this obfuscation:** An attacker may try to account for the added noise by modifying the distance similarity threshold \( \tau_d \) used in the EPZ identification algorithm.
- **Simple Extension:**
  \[
  \tau'_d = \tau_d + cF
  \]
  - We parameterized \( c \) by selecting a random subset of 1,000 athletes and running our algorithm with different \( c \) values but a fixed \( F \) of 80 meters. The optimal value of \( c \) turned out to be 1.
- **Tuning Fuzzing Parameter:**
  - For each of the 5 permissible Strava radii \( r \), we applied different values of \( F \) ranging from 40 to \( r \), with a ceiling of 500 meters.
  - **Results (Figure 10b):**
    - A protected location can be predicted with 96% accuracy when \( r = 0.250 \) miles, but this drops to 32% with \( r = 0.250 \) miles and \( F = 40 \) meters.
    - Higher \( F \) values offer diminishing returns on privacy. At \( F = 200 \) meters (0.124 miles), accuracy is less than or equal to 15% against all radii.
  - **Conclusion:** Injecting a small amount of noise into EPZ intersection points can lead to significant increases in privacy levels, though more expressive models may overcome this fuzzing noise.

### Spatial Cloaking

- **Against this obfuscation:** Predicting the center of the enhanced EPZ is no longer effective, as the protected location is equally likely to fall anywhere within the circle.
- **New Attack Proposal:**
  - We propose an attack that interpolates the direction of routes as they enter the EPZ.
  - **Intuition (Figure 11):** For each user activity, we inspect the last two GPS points at the end of the route, extend the route through the EPZ with linear interpolation, and tabulate the intersection points.
  - **Prediction Success:**
    - If multiple intersection points fall within \( t_d \) of each other, we calculate the centroid of these points and issue a prediction.
    - Our prediction is successful if the highest confidence centroid falls within 50 meters of the actual protected location.

**Table 2: Success Rate of Interpolation Attack vs. Random Guess**

| Radii (miles) | Random Guess (%) | Prediction (%) | Improvement (x) |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0.125         | 6.178             | 45.0           | 7               |
| 0.250         | 1.544             | 41.3           | 27              |
| 0.375         | 0.686             | 39.1           | 57              |
| 0.500         | 0.386             | 37.6           | 98              |
| 0.625         | 0.247             | 36.2           | 147             |

- **Conclusion:** This simple interpolation attack is 36.2% to 45.0% accurate against geo-indistinguishability techniques, significantly outperforming random guessing.

### Discussion & Mitigation

#### Strava’s Global Heat Map Incident
- **Background:** The release of Strava’s Global Heatmap published aggregated public usage data for 27 million users, intended to help athletes discover new exercise locations and assist in city planning.
- **Privacy Risks:**
  - The heatmap leaked sensitive and classified information about military bases and patrol routes.
  - A related vulnerability allowed attackers to upload spoofed GPS data to discover athlete IDs, potentially identifying insecure locations associated with military or intelligence personnel.
- **User Behavior:**
  - We found that a non-negligible minority of athletes at sensitive sites were using EPZs, suggesting awareness of privacy risks.

#### Attack Replication
- **Map My Tracks:**
  - Users can set EPZs of radii 500, 1000, or 1500 meters.
  - Our attack successfully identified sensitive locations regardless of EPZ size.
- **Garmin Connect:**
  - Provides EPZs with radii ranging from 100 to 1000 meters in 100-meter increments.
  - Our attack reliably recovered the protected location for 100, 500, and 1000-meter EPZs.

#### Additional Mitigations
- **Randomize Resource IDs:** Use randomly assigned resource identifiers from a large space.
- **Authenticate All Resource Requests:** Place fine-grained resources behind an authentication wall.
- **Server-Side Rendering of Map Resources:** Render activity maps on the server or filter and fuzz GPS coordinates.
- **Conceal Existence of EPZ:** Ensure consistency in the advertised distance of activities to prevent detection of EPZs.

### Related Work

- **Prior Studies:**
  - Williams [11] found that most Strava users considered privacy issues and took measures like setting up privacy zones.
  - Our study shows that only 9% of activities used privacy zones, indicating insufficient protection.
- **Location Privacy:**
  - Geo-indistinguishability has been used to provide static location privacy by perturbing real locations with fake ones.
  - Techniques like Planar Laplace mechanisms [26] are not directly applicable to mobility data such as athlete routes.
