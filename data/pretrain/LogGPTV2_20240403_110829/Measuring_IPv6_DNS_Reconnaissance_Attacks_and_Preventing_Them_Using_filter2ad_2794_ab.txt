Fig. 3: The IPv6 reverse DNS search algorithm: If, for example, an input address preﬁx is 2001:620:0::/48, the program creates
a reverse lookup query ‘0.0.0.0.0.0.2.6.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa’ and sends to the target DNS server. If the DNS server response is
‘NXDOMAIN’ (means there are no records for ‘*.ip6.arpa’ in the domain name space), the program will check the current
nibble value. If the current nibble is equal to F, the program will be terminated; otherwise, it increases the current value by one.
In contrast, if the ‘NXERROR’ (means this ‘*.ip6.arpa’ domain exists in the ip6.arpa domain, but there are no PTR records
for it) response comes back, it will create a new nibble to add to the existing IPv6 address and this new nibble starts with
zero.
reply to any wild card queries with a signed response. Besides,
each signed response contains a next available domain’s Re-
source Record Set (RRset), such as an IP address record, a
name server record, and a canonical name record. However,
NSEC also introduces some new security issues. Peter Van
Dijk [12] discovered that an attacker could easily gather IPv4
and IPv6 addresses by using the NSEC list. He described a
searching mechanism to gain IPv6 addresses from the NSEC
record. First, users need to give a domain name that they want
to search. When the program receives the domain name, it
appends a random string to the given domain name. If the
domain uses the NSEC record, it will return a chain of existing
zone names; the program then sends a lookup query to search
IPv4 address and IPv6 address records for each zone.
III. EVALUATING DNS IPV6 RECONNAISSANCE ATTACK
To evaluate the IPv6 reconnaissance techniques already
explained in the previous section, we used a free software
tool, THC-IPv6 [16], in order to launch IPv6 address scanning
attacks in real IPv6 networks. We modiﬁed the source code
and added our experiment detail in each DNS request. In
our experiments, we do not want network administrators to
regard our experiment as an attack. To deal with ethical
concerns, we speciﬁed in each DNS request the following:
the number of IPv6 addresses that can be collected from each
IPv6 network; a message that our experiment is probing the
public DNS servers; and we are not monitoring the trafﬁc from
any production network.
A. Our Methodology
1) IPv6 Reverse DNS Reconnaissance Attack: Fig. 3 shows
a ﬂow diagram of the DNS reverse search algorithm. We used
dnsrevenum6.c from the THC-IPv6 [16] package in order to
develop a DNS reverse lookup tool. We used a Poisson dis-
tribution to compute delay between queries so as to minimise
the load on DNS servers. Also, we embed information about
our survey into every reverse lookup request for explaining
our survey to network administrators. In order to clarify any
security changes in the past three years for resolving the DNS
reverse zone vulnerability, we chose to repeat the Hu et al.
[7] experiment that was initially conducted in 2014. We use
the same matrix from their experiment, such as collecting 20

Fig. 4: A DNSSEC zone walking methodology: A user sends
a DNSSEC query to look at .testx.com. A Local DNS Server
returns a response that says the requested zone record does not
exist, but there is a record for test2.com. Now the user queries
.test2.com, the Local DNS Server returns the IPv4 and IPv6
addresses for .test2.com. In addition, the response contains the
next domain’s information. By using this method, we can walk
through all the zone ﬁles in the test.com domain. Furthermore,
if the network administrators set up the IPv6 addresses for each
existing zone, using the above method, we are able to collect
allocated IPv6 addresses for each zone.
hosts from each surveyed network, scanning 5 regions and
using ::/48 preﬁx address blocks.
In order to launch the program, users need to give a network
preﬁx of the reverse DNS zone that they want to search.
The program receives the network preﬁx and adds a new
nibble (all the new nibbles start with zero) to append it to
the given domain name. The program then sends a reverse
lookup with this new address block to DNS servers. If the
DNS reverse zone returns ‘NXDOMAIN’, there are no entries
below the queried node exist. In contrast, if a response contains
‘NOERROR’, it means we can add a new nibble to the existing
IPv6 reverse lookup query and continue searching for the
current ip6.arpa zone.
2) DNSSEC Zone Walking: Similar to the previous experi-
ment, we used dnssecwalk.c from the THC-IPv6 [16] package
to search the public domains that use only NSEC records. Fig.
4 illustrates the DNSSEC walking algorithm.
B. Data Collection
To launch our ﬁrst IPv6 DNS reverse lookup, we use the
Regional Internet Registries Statistics website [17] for choos-
ing the target network preﬁx and DNS servers. This website
updates the deployment status of the IPv6 network regularly.
We launched our program across 5 regions (AFRINIC5, AP-
NIC6, ARIN7, LACNIC8 and RIPE NCC9) and one hundred

countries that have signiﬁcant IPv6 deployments. For the
DNSSEC zone scanning, we obtain Alexa’s Top 1 million
datasets to scan the ﬁrst 100,000 public domains. We limit
our search program to a maximum of 10 hosts for each NSEC
enabled domain, because we do not want to generate too much
trafﬁc to the target DNS servers. Besides, 10 hosts can be used
for analysing the IPv6 address allocation mechanisms.
IV. RESULTS
While the IPv6 reconnaissance attack has been discussed in
[2], [3], [4], [18], [19], [20]. It seems that this type of attack is
not getting enough attention from network administrators. To
measure the feasibility of collecting IPv6 addresses from the
public DNS servers, we leverage the technique used in [3] and
[7]. Furthermore, we take a slightly different approach than
previous studies by launching a global DNSSEC zone walk to
investigate the security impact of putting IPv6 addresses into
NSEC records. Based on our two global measurement results,
we expect to answer the following questions: Do network
administrators take action to resolve the DNS reverse lookup
issues? What is the potential issue raised by saving IPv6
addresses into an NSEC record? What is the most common
address allocation strategy in our result? In the following, we
will explain our results in detail.
A. IPv6 DNS Reverse Zone Searching
Hu et al. [7] did a global measurement in 2014, they scanned
50 countries around the world and reported the problem of
putting IPv6 addresses in a DNS reverse zone. In order to
provide detailed analysis on whether network administrators
have reduced the risk of IPv6 reconnaissance attacks in the
last three years, we repeated the same experiment in 2017
and used the same parameters in our experiment. In [7], Hu
et al. launched the experiment crossing 5 regions and 50
countries. Furthermore, they used ::/48 network preﬁx as the
query parameter and collected 20 IPv6 addresses from each
scanned reverse zone.
We launched our survey from October 2017 to November
2017 and collected results from 50 countries that have signif-
icant IPv6 deployments. Table I shows the top 20 countries
from our results that have a large number of deployed /48
address blocks and the number of surveyed network preﬁxes
that have more than 20 live IPv6 records. Comparing with
the survey in 2014 [7], we notice a few changes: The DNS
reverse zone probing is still effective in our current networks;
the adoption of IPv6 has been steadily increasing in the past
three years;
there are some challenges when running our
reconnaissance methodology in the current network. First, we
discovered that it is still possible to collect IPv6 addresses
from most scanned DNS reverse zones, we observed 9980
IPv6 addresses from our result. Second, we found that the
number of IPv6 hosts increases every year. In 2014, Hu
et al. found 74 ip6.arpa zones from the United States, this
value increased to 95 in our results. Luxembourg was not in
their results, but we observe that 45% of their allocated IPv6
network preﬁxes had reverse zone records in the DNS server.

et al. [21] recommend RIRs assign /48 address blocks to each

experiment and monitor the changes in last three years.

In Bulgaria, 26% of surveyed network preﬁxes had ip6.arpa
zones which allow us to collect IPv6 addresses. Again, we are
able to scan 15% of the allocated IPv6 network preﬁxes in
Romania to collect IPv6 addresses from the DNS server.
Besides, Hu et al. claimed that some countries have many
assigned address preﬁxes, but only a few ip6.arpa zones had
been found in DNS reverse zones. We observed the same
scenario in our results, such as India had 296 assigned IPv6
address preﬁxes, but less than 1% of its ip6.arpa zones were
detected in the survey. There are several possible explanations
for this. For instance, some countries are still in the early
stages of deploying IPv6, so they do not yet have the ip6.arpa
zones in their DNS servers, or they have not set up reverse
DNS domains in the IPv6 networks. Third, we detected
some security mechanisms that have been used for preventing
reverse zone searching in current networks, such as conﬁguring
wild card records for the entire range of IPv6 clients or the
root DNS forbidding any DNS queries to enumerate the zone
[3].
B. IPv6 DNSSEC Zone Searching
We launched our second experiment for one month and
scanned the data from Alexa’s Top 100,000 records.
We used this public dataset to allow researchers to easily
reproduce our experiment. To collect 10 records from each
NSEC enabled domain, since we do not want to launch a
DNSSEC zone walking in real networks, we have limited our
searching to a reasonable size for analysing the most common
IPv6 allocation strategy.
The second experiment launches a DNSSEC zone walking
attack on popular websites. Similar to the previous experiment,
we scanned ﬁve regions and the top 100,000 domains from the
Alexa’s record. We summarised our results based on the top
level domain type: Country code and Generic (e.g., com, org,
net, edu, and gov). The experiment results exposed the security
impact of putting IPv6 addresses in NSEC records. In contrast,
we observed that some countries resolved the DNSSEC zone
walking issue by not sending the response back. As can be
seen in Table II, we listed ten countries with the highest
NSEC enabled or disabled rates. We found that using NSEC
records is more prevalent in some countries. For instance, 8%
domains from the Czech Republic have NSEC enabled. Brazil
has the second highest NSEC enabled rate, i.e., 3%. Besides,
the NSEC records can help attackers to collect IPv6 addresses;
we discovered that 15% of NSEC enabled domains have IPv6
records. In addition, some DNS servers do not respond to
our request, we presume network administrators conﬁgure a
ﬁrewall to ﬁlter the IPv6 DNSSEC lookup request.
We also analysed the generic top domain, the core group of
generic top-level domains consist of the com, edu, info, and
org domains. In Table III, we found that 99% of the com do-
mains forbid DNSSEC zone walking. The NSEC record is less
prominent in those domains. In contrast, 6% of the surveyed
government websites are vulnerable to DNSSEC scanning.
Another 2% of educational websites lacked expected pro-
tection on DNSSEC zones. Attackers can leverage DNSSEC
enabled zones to collect IPv6 addresses. The remaining results
are less than 1%, but they still demonstrate the feasibility of
using DNSSEC zones to collect IPv6 addresses.
C. Address Conﬁguration in IPv6
During our analysis, we noted that some IPv6 addresses can
be utilised to reduce the IPv6 address searching space. Similar
to previous studies [2], [4], [18], [19], [20], some network
administrators still manually conﬁgure predictable values in
their Interface Identiﬁed ﬁeld (IID). In [22], Hinden et al.
speciﬁed that an IPv6 unicast address consists of n bits of
network preﬁx and (128 - n) bits of IID. The network preﬁx
is used to route packets to a subnet, and the IID refers to the
ownership of a given interface that connects to the subnet. We
listed four popular IID allocation strategies in our results and
brieﬂy explained those approaches.
Randomised addresses. Fernando Gont [23] claimed to
generate randomised stable IPv6 addresses in each subnet.
When the host moves to other subnets, the value in IPv6
address space must be re-generated, such that this solution
eliminates address predictability issues.
Sequential increase in host numbering. The IID ﬁeld is
sequentially increased when generating a new IPv6 address.
Besides, the IID ﬁeld contains few non-zero bytes, the remain-
ing bytes are all set to 0, e.g., 2001:df0:0::1 and 2001:df0:0::2.
