Currently all the twig files have to be put inside the Resources/views folder
of the app or bundle folder. Some time ago a new option was added to add new
paths where the file locator should search for. However, I'm unable to use it
because it seems that they are ignored. We can analyze a simple test case
where I want to have some templates inside the directory
bundle/Resources/templates/mytemplate/views. I add the path to the config,
then I render from a controller a template which resides in that folder with
the usual string Bundle:MyControllerName:mytemplate.html.twig. This string is
then converted to a resource location which starts with the @ and the file
locator is called. However when a path starts with that symbol it doesn't call
the locate method of the FileLocator class but it calls the locateResource
method of the HttpKernel class which knows nothing about the paths and just
throws the exception of file not found. Maybe I'm understanding wrong how the
paths options should be used: if it's the case, then please help me understand
how can I use custom path locations for my templates.
