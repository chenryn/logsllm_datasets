# Floppy
Misc.
## Description:
> Using the credentials from the letter, you logged in to the Foobanizer9000-PC. It has a floppy drive...why? There is an .ico file on the disk, but it doesn't smell right..
A binary file was attached.
## Solution:
Let's inspect the attached file:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/google/floppy# file foo.ico
foo.ico: MS Windows icon resource - 1 icon, 32x32, 16 colors
```
It looks like a harmless icon file... or does it?
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/google/floppy# binwalk foo.ico
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

```
Extract with `binwalk` and inspect:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/google/floppy# binwalk foo.ico -e
