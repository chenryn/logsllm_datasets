User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Wireshark filter to only capture Incoming Packets? I am trying to setup a Filter (so my log files aren't massive) that will capture only incoming traffic. I have looked on http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureFilters but so far have been unable to find a way to do this. Does anyone know how?

Just as a side question, when logging to multiple files in Wireshark, can you view full packet information at a later time?

Assistant: you would want to only capture traffic that is destined for your host's IP: 

dst host &lt;your Ip&gt;


Sorry, read that as display filter.  the above has been corrected for CAPTURE filter syntax.
