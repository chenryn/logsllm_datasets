### Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

I have been using this terminal for a while and find it very impressive. However, I have a feature request. In my daily work, I frequently use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Currently, when I open the terminal or create a new tab (using `Ctrl+Shift+T`), the default shell is PowerShell. 

It would be very helpful if there was an option to set the default shell for new tabs. This way, I could configure WSL as the default shell instead of PowerShell.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

One possible implementation could be to add a new configuration option in the `settings.json` file. For example:

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "wsl"
}
```

This would allow users to specify their preferred default shell, such as WSL, PowerShell, or any other available shell.

Thank you for considering this feature request!
