# Description of the new feature/enhancement
Hi, I have been using this Terminal for a while and find it impressive. But I
have one question/feature request here, I use WSL in my daily work and the new
tab is Powershell by default when I open the Terminal or create a new
tab(ctrl+shift+t)... Is there a way to set my default tab?
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
In settings.json adds default tab entry I think..
