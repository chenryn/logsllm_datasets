## Context
I would like to apply inline styles to the `Dialog` component's `Backdrop` and `Paper` elements. Specifically, I am interested in styling the `Paper` element, but the same question applies to the `Backdrop` as well. However, when I set the `style` prop, it only affects the root `Dialog` element. Is there a way to directly apply inline styles to the `Backdrop` and `Paper` components?
