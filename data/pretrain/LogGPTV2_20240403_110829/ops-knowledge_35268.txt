User: I have a program I want to open when I open Chrome. Instead of opening them separately, I want it to automatically start when Chrome starts. How would I write code to have the program attach itself to Chrome? I don't want the program to start on startup, just when Chrome starts. I know I can right click on the Chrome icon on my desktop and change the properties to open both programs but I want to know how to do the same thing with code.
Assistant: Lots of options.  Which you should choose depends on lots of things.  Sorry for being so vague, but your question does not give any details besides the name Chrome.

How ever you start Chrome, e. g. by a button or menu of your window manager, maybe you can tweak that button or menu to start both programs.  This is probably the simplest solution, but of course it bears the risk that a different event starts Chrome (e. g. clicking a link in a mail program).  This would then pass-by your Program.
You can write a daemon process which you start via login-scripts at login time.  That daemon would try to figure out when you start Chrome (e. g. by polling the process table) and react by starting your accompanying program.
You can configure Chrome so that it starts your program upon starting time.  How to do this is a whole new question in itself with lots of answers; options include at least writing a plugin for Chrome which does what you want.
You can have your program up and running all the time (started via login scripts, i. e. too early) but stay invisible and passive until Chrome starts up.  This is basically the same as option 2, just that your program is itself that daemon.

In case you tell us more, we probably can give narrower and thus more fitting answers.
