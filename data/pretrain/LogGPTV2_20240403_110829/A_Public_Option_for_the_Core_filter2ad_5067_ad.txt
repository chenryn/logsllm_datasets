colocated. The resulting POC network has 4674 point-to-point con-
nections between POC routers; we call these connections logical
links because they may involve several physical links. The BPs vary
in size, contributing from roughly 2% to roughly 12% of the logi-
cal links in the POC. We then generated a synthetic traffic matrix
between all POC routers, and ran our auction with three different
constraints (always looking for the cheapest solution that satisfies
each constraint). Constraint #1 only requires that the set of links
can handle the offered load. Constraint #2 requires that it could
do so assuming that any single path between a pair of routers has
failed. Constraint #3 requires that it do so assuming that a path be-
tween each pair of routers has failed. For each of these scenarios,
we computed 𝐶𝛼 and 𝑃𝛼 , and in Figure 2 we show the resulting

, of the five largest
BPs. One aspect to note is the high variation in the PoB, which is a
good reason for the POC to use an open algorithm so that it cannot
be accused of favoritism.
3.4 Peering Arrangements
𝐶𝛼
We now focus on the POC and the attached LMPs, asking whether
and how they exchange traffic, and ignore the rest of the Internet for
the moment. The nature of peering relationships among the attached
LMPs, and specifically whether network neutrality would dictate an
answer, depends greatly on how the POC fits into the overall Internet
ecosystem. In particular, is it considered an ISP, or an IXP?
If one thinks of the POC as a large ISP (with all those connecting
to it being customers in the traditional provider-peer-customer cate-
gorization) then network neutrality requires that each LMP accepts
whatever traffic arrives from the POC, not discriminating based on
the original source of packets. Moreover, network neutrality requires
that there be no termination fee for packets arriving from one of the
other LMPs, because there is no direct peering relationship between
the LMPs. In short, if the POC is seen as an ISP, and network neu-
trality continues to hold, then LMPs treat all arriving packets equally.
The only payments are from the LMPs to the POC for providing
core network service.
If one thinks of the POC as a global IXP – that is, essentially
a policy-free interconnection infrastructure that allows all LMPs
to peer (or not) with each other directly – then each LMP must
decide with which other LMPs to peer (and exchange traffic), and
whether any fees should be paid in doing so. One might think that
enabling direct peering between all POC-connected LMPs would
help foster network neutrality, because there are no intermediate
transit ISPs to discriminate against traffic, but the opposite is true!
Network neutrality has never constrained an individual domain’s
choice of peering: if peering is direct, discrimination based on the
nature of the connecting LMP is easy to implement and does not
violate network neutrality. For instance, if Netflix directly attaches
to the POC (and acts as an LMP), and we consider the POC to
be an IXP, then all other LMPs would be free (even under network
neutrality regulations) to refuse to peer with Netflix without payment
for doing so; in short, they could demand that Netflix pay them to be
their “provider” in the traditional sense of customer/provider peering
arrangements, and refuse to interconnect if Netflix refused to pay.
However, such a decision to not interconnect would be harmful,
because it would disconnect pairs of LMPs, which would lead to
fragmentation of the Internet. In today’s Internet, each customer
(whether enterprise, home, or CSP) is responsible for finding some
ISP who will connect them to the rest of the Internet; there are many
available ISPs that offer this service, so one relies on the market to
provide acceptable solutions. However, for LMPs directly connected
to the POC and only connected to the POC, the POC is the only way
to interconnect with other LMPs, so there is no other choice.
Whether one considers this a network neutrality question or a
peering question, the criteria for making this choice should be to
choose the option that is best for the long-term health of the Internet.
We consider this question in great detail in the next section by
analyzing a formal model for these peering decisions, and come to
the conclusion that it is best that LMPs be required to peer without
termination fees with all other LMPs.
One might argue that this is unfair to LMPs that must carry
traffic to their customers from bandwidth-heavy video services, with-
out compensation from those video services. However, we are not
proposing that LMPs cannot be compensated for the service they
provide, we merely require that they obtain their compensation from
their directly-paying customers rather from the LMPs they peer with.
A key point in our design is that there is no need for compensation
at a distance, except between CSPs and users (where the interaction
occurs at the application-level). The LMP customers of the POC are
paying for all traffic carried from and to them by the POC. Similarly,
the customers of each LMP are paying for all traffic carried from
and to them by that LMP.
If one of the endpoints on the POC is a CSP like Netflix, then
the customers pay this service directly, which can cover Netflix’s
payments to its LMP (or to the POC if it is connected directly)
for the bandwidth it uses. And the customers of Netflix are also
paying their LMPs for the bandwidth they receive from Netflix.
Thus, in our proposed arrangement, every LMP or CSP who is
incurring large bandwidth costs recoups those costs directly from
their customers (who are the ultimate cause of that traffic), rather
than expecting non-customers to help defray those costs. By having
the bandwidth costs collected by the parties causing them (the CSP
and the end user), and payments for the service made directly to the
CSP by the customers, this leads to a natural splitting of the revenues
between LMPs and CSPs in a way that is driven by customer’s
willingness to pay and the presence of competitive alternatives, rather
than through painful negotiations filled with brinkmanship as in the
Netflix-Cogent-Comcast case.
However, this does require that users pay for their bandwidth
usage. Historically, imposing bandwidth limits and usage-based
charging has resulted in significantly bad press for the ISPs propos-
ing such measures. However, we think the economics on this are
clear; it is better to have costs borne by the entities that caused those
costs. We should also note that whatever you think of our proposal,
termination fees are not the right way of dealing with this problem.
Allowing LMPs to impose termination fees is a mechanism that can
improve LMP profits, but in no way guarantees that this additional
revenue was needed to expand capacity or that the LMPs will indeed
spend it on expanding capacity. As we will see in the next section,
when termination fees are allowed, the LMP can extract revenue
from CSPs independent of whether it is needed to cover bandwidth
costs.
Before continuing, we make the peering conditions precise, with
the caveat that exceptions should be made for security concerns
(which may require blocking) or internal maintenance traffic (which
may require priority or other special handling). The peering condi-
tions we impose are that a POC-connected LMP must not: (i) dif-
ferentially (in terms of priorities or blocking) treat incoming traffic
based on the source or application, nor differentially treat outgoing
traffic based on the destination or application; or (ii) differentially
provide CDN or other application-enhancement services based on
the source (for incoming packets) or destination (for outgoing pack-
ets); or (iii) differentially allow third-parties to provide CDN or other
application-enhancement services that only target a subset of traffic
(where this last condition prevents an LMP from allowing, say, Net-
flix to install services that enhance their traffic but disallowing others
from installing such services). These conditions also apply to traffic

arising within the LMP providing content or services to customers.
Also, note that the LMP can offer application-enhancement services
or QoS for a given price, and only provide those services to those
who pay; what they cannot do is arbitrarily discriminate between
traffic.
These are included in the terms-of-service. If widespread cheating
is anticipated, the POC could only forward encrypted traffic making
in harder for LMPs to discriminate, but this would require a software
change by users, which is unlikely.
4 The Case for Network Neutrality
4.1 Preliminaries
The peering policy presented in Section 3.4 is a crucial aspect
of our proposal. To make this fundamental decision, we had to first
consider three preliminary questions:
By what criteria do we make this fundamental decision? Here
we take an economic perspective and focus on two goals: maximizing
social welfare and fostering competition. Social welfare is the total
utility (which for us will be the sum of utilities over all users); it
ignores payments made by users because payments merely transfer
some of that utility to others, and social welfare does not measure
how utility is distributed within society, it merely measures the total.
To be clear, we also care about the distribution but, as we will note
later, if we succeed in fostering competition then the distributional
issues will work themselves out.
As for fostering competition, we want an environment where the
large incumbents do not have unfair advantages over new entrants in
the market (where the operational definition of unfair will become
clear later in this section). Fair competition is what allows new and
innovative CSPs and LMPs to gain a foothold in the market, which
in turn (because of their innovation which hopefully leads to better
services that create more user utility) can lead to increases in future
social welfare. So in some sense our goals are both about social
welfare; one focuses on the current social welfare and the other on
the future social welfare.
How do we model the economic interactions? To determine which
peering policies would best achieve our goals, we must analyze a
simple model that attempts to capture the relevant economic interac-
tions. For issues as complicated as commercial transactions in the
Internet ecosystem, any model we consider will be oversimplified.
Choosing a good model is more art than science, in that the model
must be both tractable (so we can derive results) and representative
(yielding results that are suggestive of what would happen in the real
world). The former is easy to characterize, but the latter is a matter
of judgement.
What peering policies do we consider? We obviously cannot con-
sider all possible policies that could guide how LMPs interact. For
instance, one LMP might provide different levels of service (i.e.,
QoS) to traffic from various other LMPs, or enter into joint mar-
keting agreements, or collude to raise prices in a geographic area.
Here, we restrict ourselves to two possible forms of peering: (1)
freely peering, where every LMP accepts incoming traffic from all
other LMPs and CSPs without any termination fees and (2) for-fee
peering, where LMPs can charge termination fees to CSPs, or block
their traffic if they refuse to pay. In both cases, we assume no traffic
discrimination (by which we mean prioritization based on source,
rather than different QoS levels which are charged differently inde-
pendent of source). Thus, we want to consider two scenarios, one
where network neutrality (NN) is contractually enforced by the POC,
and an unregulated (UR) scenario where LMPs are free to impose
termination fees and block traffic if they are not paid. While this
may be limiting, it does yield conclusions that intuitively (but not
quantitatively) apply to traffic discrimination in that imposing poor
QoS on incoming traffic reduces the value of that traffic to users, so
it can be seen as a form of termination fee.
4.2 Our Model
We consider a model that only contains the POC and the LMPs
and CSPs directly connected to it. For ease of exposition we assume
all LMPs are eyeball networks (this does not alter our analysis); the
directly attached CSPs sell services to the users of the LMPs. We
assume that the CSPs have no marginal costs for adding customers
(as these are online services, and the costs are small enough to
ignore in our simple model). In the NN scenario, the LMPs freely
accept traffic from all CSPs. In the UR scenario, they can impose a
termination fee 𝑡 on a CSP or block its traffic.
There is a complicated competitive process between LMPs, who
face high capital costs to enter the market, and lower marginal costs;
these conditions are a recipe for natural monopolies, but even so
some competition survives. Rather than model this directly, which
would necessarily fall short of reality, we merely assume that the
competition between LMPs results in one or more LMPs for each
region, and that customers have chosen a single LMP for their con-
nectivity. We assume this choice changes slowly, so that in the
short term each LMP is the monopoly connectivity provider for
its customers. Thus, while LMPs may coexist in a region, and the
competition between them involves many different factors (cost
structure, bandwidth, SLAs, etc.), we assume that this competition
results (over the short term) in a static partitioning of customers
among LMPs.
Similarly, there is a complicated market for content and services
on the Internet, with all the products competing for user attention
and with many products serving as partial substitutes for others.
Again, instead of modeling this competition directly, which would
be impossible to do with any accuracy, we merely consider a set
of independent goods which are not substitutes for each other. This
is unrealistic, but gives the best case for termination fees (i.e., it
minimizes their harm): if the CSP market is fully competitive, then
LMPs have all the market power (and can set the termination fees
to maximize their own revenue, which we model in Section 4.4),
whereas if the goods are not competitive the market power of the
LMPs is limited so, as we describe in Section 4.5, the setting of
the termination fees can be modeled as a negotiation. In addition,
we assume that each CSP charges a uniform price for their service
independent of a user’s LMP, and that the distribution of demand for
a CSP is the same for customers of each LMP.
To express this model mathematically, we consider a mass of
consumers, most conveniently described as a unit mass on the unit
interval. Each consumer has a choice among a variety of CSPs,
𝑠 = 1, ..., 𝑆. The value that a specific consumer attaches to service 𝑠 is
given by 𝑣𝑠, also called its “willingness to pay”. The demand for each
CSP is determined by the cumulative distribution of these values
SIGCOMM ’20, August 10–14, 2020, Virtual Event, NY, USA
Y. Harchol, et al
in the population, denoted by 𝐹𝑠 (𝑣𝑠), which quantifies the fraction
of consumers with willingness to pay less than 𝑣𝑠. We assume that
𝐹𝑠 (𝑣𝑠) also describes the distribution of demands of the customer
populations in each LMP.
Any consumer who has a value 𝑣𝑠 weakly larger than the posted
price 𝑝𝑠 will buy that CSP’s service. The demand 𝐷𝑠 at price 𝑝𝑠 for
the service 𝑠 is therefore
𝐷𝑠 (𝑝𝑠) = 1 − 𝐹𝑠 (𝑝𝑠) ,
which is monotone decreasing in the price 𝑝𝑠.
Similarly, there are a variety of LMPs, 𝑙 = 1, ..., 𝐿. Each consumer
only has a single LMP. Each LMP 𝑙 charges a price 𝑐𝑙 to their
customers. In what follows, we ignore any welfare derived from
merely having connectivity, and only focus on welfare arising from
the CSPs.
4.3 Network Neutrality
We begin our analysis by assuming that we are in the network
neutrality (NN) regime where no termination fees are allowed. Being
connected to the network, each consumer can choose to purchase
as many of the CSP services as she deems valuable. Since we have
assumed the CSP products are not substitutes for each other, each
