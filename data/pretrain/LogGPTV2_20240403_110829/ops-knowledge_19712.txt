User: I want deploy a project in google appengine to search edonkey/emule, Is there any python implement of edonkey/emule or ed2k protocol library ?
Assistant: After 20 minutes of googling all combinations of python and edonkey/emule/ed2k and visiting all sites of all clients listed under the "eDonkey network" Wikipedia page I can say with near certainty that the answer is "No."
