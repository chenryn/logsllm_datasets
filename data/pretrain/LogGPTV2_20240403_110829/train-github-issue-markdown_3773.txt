Current functionality only allows splitting the input data into 2 parts i.e.
"Train" and "Test" datasets.  
Extension to this functionality is to allow 3 splits of dataset i.e. Train,
Test and Validation using the function call only once.  
High level impact assessment changes to :-
  1. train_test_split()
  2. Other modules may also be impacted - Assessment ongoing
