(cid:6) may be in error or it may attempt to cheat in several ways
and its delegation policy may thus be pathological. For example,
(cid:6) (cid:13)(cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:12) may delegate a preﬁx (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) to another organization
even when no other organization had delegated a superpreﬁx of
(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) to it. (cid:6) may delegate (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) to more than one other organization
or it may assign it to an AS number while also delegating it to
another organization, perhaps mistakenly or maliciously. In these
cases its delegation policy for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) consists of more than one pair.
Below we will enlarge the set of options available for a delegation
policy to allow for incremental deployment. Before we do so it will
be helpful to deﬁne the delegation graph in order to deﬁne valid
delegation policies.
The delegation graph (cid:17) (cid:0) (cid:18)(cid:3) (cid:19) is a directed graph with la-
belled edges whose vertex and edge sets are deﬁned as follows.
The vertex set is the union of the set of organizations  and the
set of AS numbers (cid:0)(cid:1) . In addition, there are two special ver-
tices labelled R for RESERVED and (cid:14). The directed edges of
the delegation graph represent the delegation policies of every or-
ganization as follows. For every (cid:6) and for each triple of the form
(cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:3) (cid:20) in (cid:6)’s delegation policy a directed edge labelled (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14)
is placed from (cid:6) to (cid:20) where (cid:20) is in  (cid:15) (cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:15) (cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:4). In addition,
if (cid:6)’s delegation policy for a preﬁx (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) is the empty set, a directed
edge labelled (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) is placed from (cid:6) to (cid:14).
(cid:2)RESERVED indicates that (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) should be neither advertised nor
delegated. We include this for completeness, but for brevity defer
further discussion.
Deﬁnition: A node that has one or more outgoing edges labelled
by a subpreﬁx of (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) but no incoming edges labelled by a super-
preﬁx of (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) is called an ownership source for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14).
Note that IANA is an ownership source for every preﬁx.
Deﬁnition: A node that has one or more incoming edges labelled
by (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) but no outgoing edges labelled by a subpreﬁx of (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) is
called an assignment terminal for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14). An edge labelled by (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14)
pointing to an assingment terminal for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) is called an assignment
edge for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14).
Recall that by construction, for every preﬁx (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14), every node in
 has at least one outgoing edge labelled (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) pointing to a node in
(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:14)(cid:4). Thus, no node in  is an assignment termi-
nal. Also note that given the set of delegation/assignment options
above, the nodes in (cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:15) (cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:4) (cid:15) (cid:3)(cid:14)(cid:4) have no outgoing edges.
Thus, the assignment terminals are a subset of (cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:15) (cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:4) (cid:15) (cid:3)(cid:14)(cid:4).
Deﬁnition: An assignment edge is ASN-respecting if it is from a
organization (cid:6) to an AS number in (cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:6) or to R or to (cid:14).
Deﬁnition: A directed path in the delegation graph is monotonic if
the label of each edge in the path, except for the ﬁrst, is a subpreﬁx
of the label of the previous edge.
Thus far we have not constrained an organization’s delegation
policies in any way. Except for the fact that the assignment ter-
minals are a subset of (cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:15) (cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:4) (cid:15) (cid:3)(cid:14)(cid:4) the delegation graph
can be arbitrary.
It can have multiple ownership sources for the
same preﬁx, multiple assignment terminals, and multiple, intersect-
ing monotonic paths. In fact, the monotonic paths might even have
cycles. Below we deﬁne what paths in the delegation graph are
valid and then we will describe origin authentication tags which
can be used by those receiving BGP announcements to decide the
validity of the delegation path among other things.
Validity of Delegation Paths: A directed path in the delegation
graph is a valid delegation path for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) if
a) the ownership source is IANA,
b) the path is monotonic,
c) the path is acyclic, and
d) the assignment edge is labelled (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) and is ASN-respecting.
A partial delegation path, i.e., one in which the minimal node
is in , is valid if the ownership source is IANA and the path is
monotonic and acyclic.
The Acyclic Requirement: The acyclic requirement for a valid
path requires some discussion. Consider a monotonic path with
a cycle and let (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) be the smallest preﬁx in the cycle. Because
of the subtree semantics of delegations, such a cycle would seem
to give each organization on the cycle equal claim to subsequent
delegation or assignment of (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14). Clearly, an honest organization
(cid:6) would not purposefully participate in a cycle of delegation. But
the local connectivity of (cid:6) in the delegation graph is not enough
information to rule out being in a cycle when organizations which
are not (cid:6)’s immediate neighbors are malicious or mistaken.
In
what we describe below when an organization (cid:6)(cid:1) delegates (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) to
(cid:6), (cid:6) (cid:1) gives to (cid:6) a set of delegation attestations7, one for each edge
in the partial path. With these (cid:6) can determine the validity of the
partial delegation path.
Null Assignments: As deﬁned, a valid path for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) may have an
assignment edge from (cid:6) to (cid:14) which represents the fact that (cid:6)’s
(cid:6)We adopt the term attestation from Kent et. al. [18]. In the ver-
nacular, attestations are proclamations of truth, and serve as good
metaphors for statements of address delegation.
delegation policy for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) is the empty set. This represents the fol-
lowing. When an organization has ownership of a large number of
preﬁxes it may never make BGP announcements for a large number
of them. For example, several major backbone providers were del-
egated blocks of addresses of the form (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:14) by IANA. They effec-
tively own the all the preﬁxes that are subsets of their (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:14), except
for those they have further delegated. A provider’s policy deter-
mines which of the subpreﬁxes it will pair with which of its AS
numbers in BGP UPDATE announcements and which subpreﬁxes
it decides not to announce, at least until it’s policy changes.
In
practice, only a small fraction of the possible subpreﬁxes actually
appear in announcements (see Section 5).
Faithfulness: The deﬁnitions thus far do not rule out the follow-
ing: a delegation graph that is a directed tree rooted at IANA where
every path is a valid delegation path for a preﬁx (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14). To see this
consider the simple case in which a valid partial delegation path
ends in (cid:6), and suppose that (cid:6) has even received a proof of the
validity of the path. Now suppose that (cid:6)’s delegation policy is of
the form (cid:3)(cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:3) (cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:3) (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:3) (cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:4) where neither (cid:6) (cid:1) nor (cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:1)
are members of the original partial delegation path. From one valid
partial delegation path ending in (cid:6), we get two valid partial delega-
tion paths, one ending in (cid:6)(cid:1) and one in (cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:1). Moreover, as we will
see below, it is possible for (cid:6) to construct a proof of validity of the
partial path ending in (cid:6) (cid:1) and give it to (cid:6) (cid:1) and also to construct a
proof of validity of the partial path ending in (cid:6)(cid:1)(cid:1) and give it to (cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:1).
Thus, a proof of validity of a delegation path is not sufﬁcient to
guarantee that the pairing of a preﬁx to an AS number in a BGP
announcement is unique or to guarantee that the organizations on
the path have not been malicious or mistaken. To achieve this we
require something more.
Deﬁnition: (cid:6)’s delegation policy is faithful for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) as long as
there is at most one triple in its policy of the form
1. (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:3) , where  (cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:1) ;
2. (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:3) (cid:6) (cid:1), where (cid:6) (cid:1) (cid:5) ;
3. (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:3) (cid:10);
where (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10) is a superpreﬁx of (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14). A path in the delegation graph
is faithful for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) if the delegation policy of every organization on
the graph is faithful for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14).
Fact: There is at most one path in the delegation graph that is valid
and faithful for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14).
Thus, it is sufﬁcient for receivers of announcements to check
a) the validity of the delegation path, and
b) the faithfulness of the delegation policies of the organizations
on the path.
We will discuss the former and the latter in turn below. But ﬁrst we
will consider the issue of incremental deployment.
Incremental Deployment: We now describe a generalization of
the above scheme that will facilitate incremental deployment. In
addition to the three assignments or delegations listed above that (cid:6)
may perform for a given preﬁx (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14), an additional option is allowed:
4. (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:3) (cid:15), i.e., (cid:6)’s delegation or assignment of (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) is
UNAUTHENTICATED;
To describe the semantics of option 4 consider the delegation graph
for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14). Option 4 adds an edge from (cid:6) to every node but (cid:6) in  (cid:15)
(cid:0)(cid:1) . In addition, option 4 has subtree semantics. The deﬁnition
of a valid path remains exactly the same:
the ownership source
must be IANA, the path must be acyclic, and the edge assignment
must be ASN-respecting. As before, (cid:6) will compute and distribute
a proof that (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:3) (cid:15) is in its delegation policy. (It might put
the proof in a public directory, such as those deﬁned by S-BGP
[30], where other organizations can obtain it.) Thus, it will still
be possible for an organization to create a proof of validity for a
valid path and for other organizations, i.e., those receiving the BGP
announcement of a preﬁx, to verify the validity of the delegation
path proof.
There are two primary reasons that (cid:6) may declare (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) to be
UNAUTHENTICATED. The ﬁrst is that (cid:6) has yet to complete any
internal accounting and construction of proofs of which preﬁxes
have been assigned to which of its own AS numbers. The second is
that (cid:6) has yet to complete its accounting and construction of proofs
of which preﬁxes it has delegated to which customer organizations.
In both cases, once an organization (cid:6) has obtained the delegation
for a set of preﬁxes, it will take some time to complete the account-
ing and construction of proofs. We will consider a generalization
of the options above that allow (cid:6) to restrict the set of possible next
hops beyond the crude UNAUTHENTICATED option above in or-
der to encode intermediate states of knowledge in its auditing and
control process.
It is easy to see that having more than one node in a valid par-
tial delegation path for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) that has (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:3) (cid:15) in its delegation
policy does not increase the total number of valid origin announce-
ments for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) (argument omitted due to lack of space). Thus, for
simplicity, and without loss of generality, we require a valid path to
have at most one UNAUTHENTICATED declaration. Moreover,
that declaration should be by the last or second to last organization
in the path.
Faithfulness Revisited: Before we allowed declarations of UNAU-
THENTICATED, requiring the delegation policies of the nodes on
a delegation path to be faithful restricted the number of valid dele-
gations paths for a preﬁx to be at most one. Clearly, that is not the
case when declarations of UNAUTHENTICATED are allowed on
valid delegation paths. Nonetheless, the deﬁnition of faithfulness
is easily modiﬁed as follows. (cid:6)’s delegation policy is faithful for
(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) as long as there is at most one triple in its policy of the form
1. (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:3) , where  (cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:1) ;
2. (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:3) (cid:6) (cid:1), where (cid:6) (cid:1) (cid:5) ;
3. (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:3) (cid:15); or
4. (cid:6)(cid:3) (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:3) (cid:10);
where (cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10) is a superpreﬁx of (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14). If a delegation policy is not
faithful, then an organization (cid:6) may do the following. (cid:6) may con-
struct a delegation attestation of its declaration of UNAUTHENTI-
CATED for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) and pass that attestation to several organizations.
(cid:6) may also construct a delegation attestation for the delegation of
(cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) to (cid:6) (cid:1). (cid:6) (cid:1) may not have knowledge of the attestation that (cid:6)
gave to other organizations. Of course, (cid:6) will be constrained from
behaving this way by economic incentives. Nonetheless, (cid:6)(cid:1) may
appreciate the reassurance of a cryptographic proof of faithfulness.
Moreover, those receiving origin announcements of (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) who have
no direct economic relationship with (cid:6) may ﬁnd it useful when ap-
plying local policy to know deﬁnitively whether a preﬁx is provably
UNAUTHENTICATED or has a unique, valid and faithful delega-
tion path.
From the perspective of the delegation graph, the combination
of faithfulness and UNAUTHENTICATED declarations yields the
following.
Fact: For each terminal  for (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) in the delegation graph, there is
at most one path between IANA and  that is valid and faithful. If
no node on a valid and faithful path declares (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:14) as UNAUTHEN-
TICATED then the path, and hence, the terminal, are unique.
4.1 Origin Authentication Tags and Delega-
tion Attestations
In our scheme origin announcements are veriﬁed by Origin Au-
thentication Tags, or OATs. OATs consists of a delegation path, a
set of delegation attestations, one for each edge in the path, and an
ASN Ownership Proof. In order for an OAT to be positively veri-
ﬁed, each delegation attestation must be positively veriﬁed and the
validity of the path must be veriﬁed. To check the validity of the
path it is simple to check whether the ownership source is IANA
and whether the path is acyclic and monotonic. To check whether
the assignment edge is ASN respecting, the ASN ownership proof
is used. To simplify, an ASN ownership proof is a statement signed
by ICANN attesting to the fact that one or more AS numbers are
among those granted to a particular organization. As with address
preﬁxes, the chain of ownership/delegation may pass through more
than one organization. The details of the ASN ownership proof
is outside the scope of this paper. See the description of S-BGP
PKI [30] for a detailed description of one mechanism for ASN
ownership proofs. As we will discuss below, OATs may accom-
pany origin announcements or may be retrieved out-of-band by the
