I need to detect taps on a TextField. I'm trying to do this with
GestureDetector, but it doesn't seem be working:
    GestureDetector(
      behavior: HitTestBehavior.translucent,
      onTap: () {
        print('hi');
      },
      child: TextField(),
    ),
Nothing is printed when tapping.
Note that I need to perform an action every time the TextField is tapped,
**even after it has focus**. Therefore, I don't believe utilizing FocusNode
would work.
