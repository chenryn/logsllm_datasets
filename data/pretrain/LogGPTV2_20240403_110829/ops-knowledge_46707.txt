User: I have a python program that is running as a daemon on Linux.
How to send this daemon a signal from another python program?
Assistant: The daemon could have an open (network) socket, where it accepts commands. 
It could monitor changes in a file.

Any other kind of signalling is possible, but these would probably be the most common.
