G(t) = 1 − exp(−φt).
(7)
However, the coverage function does not have to be proper.
In many SRGMs with a time-varying testing-effort, e.g. the
one with a Weibull testing-effort proposed by Yamada et al.
[22, 23] and the one with a logistic testing-effort by Huang
et al. [8, 9], the coverage function G(t) is
G(t) = 1 − exp(−φγW ∗(t)).
(8)
In this equation, φ > 0 represents the fault detection rate
per fault and unit of testing-effort, while γ > 0 stands
for the total amount of testing-effort required by software
testing. W ∗(t) is a (non-defective) distribution function
modeling the dispersion of testing-effort over time. Since
the total testing-effort is limited by γ, limt→∞ G(t) =
1−exp(−φγ)  0.
(10)
Whatever the number of previous failures i − 1 may be,
there is always a non-zero probability that the software will
not fail an ith time. Therefore, all TTF distributions FXi(x)
connected to NHPP-I models are defective.

an NHPP-I model
An intuitive proposition is that the event of no further failure
occurrence in the future is related to the event that no addi-
tional fault is left in the software. In fact, the conditional
probability mass function of the initial number of faults N,
given that i − 1 failures have been experienced by time t,
turns out to be
P (N = n | M(t) = i − 1)

for n ≥ i − 1. Hence, the conditional distribution of the
number of faults remaining N − M(t), given that M(t) =
i − 1, is Poisson with expected value ν(1 − G(t)). If the
(i − 1)st failure occurred at time ti−1, then the conditional
probability for the event that this failure was caused by the
last of i− 1 initial faults is exp(−ν(1− G(ti−1))), which is
indeed identical to the limiting reliability in equation (10).
This seems to corroborate our assumption that the defective-
ness of the TTF distributions in NHPP-I models is linked
to the possibility of no fault remaining in the software. In
Section 4 we will study how this insight can be used for
mending TTF distributions.
3.2. Inﬁnite failures category NHPP models
Kuo and Yang [12] introduced the term “NHPP-II” for
inﬁnite failures category [17, pp. 250–251] NHPP models.
These models share the property that µ(t) approaches inﬁn-
ity as t → ∞. Kuo and Yang showed that the mean value
function of NHPP-II models can be written as
µ(t) = − ln[1 − H(t)],
(12)
where H(t) is a non-defective distribution function. The
failure times generated by such a model are the record val-
ues of independent outcomes with identical density function
h(t) = dH(t)/dt.
Since µ(t) approaches inﬁnity as t → ∞, all TTF
limx→∞ FXi(x) = 1 −
distributions are non-defective:
limx→∞ exp (−µ(ti−1 + x) + µ(ti−1)) = 1. However,
this does not necessarily mean that the expected values
(cid:182)1/θ
E(Xi) are ﬁnite. A prominent example for this phe-
nomenon is the Musa-Okumoto model [18], whose mean
value function and failure intensity are given by
λ0
ln(λ0θt + 1)
and λ(t) =
µ(t) =
λ0θt + 1 ,
(13)
respectively. In this model, only for 0 < θ < 1 the mean
time to the ith failure is ﬁnite:2
E(Xi) =
R(x | ti−1, M(ti−1) = i − 1) dx

dx 0<θ<1= λ0θti−1 + 1
λ0(1 − θ) .
While Kuo and Yang used the generic mean value func-
tion (12) only for the uniﬁcation of NHPP-II models, we
ﬁnd that taking defective distribution functions into account
allows us to include NHPP-I models as well. According
to equation (4) the relationship R(t | 0, M(0) = 0) =
exp (−µ(t)) holds for all NHPP models. Consequently,
H(t) in equation (12) is nothing but the distribution func-
tion of the ﬁrst TTF: H(t) = 1 − R(t | 0, M(0) = 0) =
FX1(t). This result shows that both NHPP-II models and
NHPP-I models can be uniﬁed via the mean value function
(15)
If a non-defective TTF distribution FX1(t) is plugged into
this equation, then an NHPP-II model is obtained. A de-
fective distribution FX1(t), on the other hand, leads to an
NHPP-I model.
µ(t) = − ln[1 − FX1(t)].
4. Truncating Poisson distributions
4.1. Truncating the distribution of the number of
inherent faults
From equation (10) we see that for an NHPP-I model
at the beginning of testing the probability that even inﬁnite
testing will lead to no failure is given by
x→∞ R(x | 0, M(0) = 0) = exp (−ν) .
lim
(16)
According to equation (11) the conditional probability for
no inherent software fault given that no failure has occurred
at the beginning of testing is
P (N = 0 | M(0) = 0) = ν0
exp(−ν) = exp(−ν). (17)
0!
This is identical to the unconditional probability P (N = 0),
since M(0) = 0 with probability one.
The equality of (16) and (17) suggests that the defective-
ness of the distribution of the time to ﬁrst failure can be
healed by removing the possibility that the number of in-
herent software faults is zero.
2Musa et al. [17, p. 291] correctly point out that the mean time to failure
only exists for θ < 1. However, their equation for calculating E(Xi) in
this case does not seem to be correct.

this by left-truncating the distribution of N. The probability
mass function of the zero-truncated Poisson distribution is

E(N) =
1 − exp(−ν) . (19)
Adopting this idea to our problem leads to the following
reliability of the software in the interval (0, x], bearing in
mind that M(0) = 0:

(20)
Since this reliability expression approaches zero as x → ∞,
the defectiveness of the distribution of the time to ﬁrst fail-
ure has indeed been mended.
.
Truncating the distribution of the number of inherent
faults implicitly replaces the original transition rate from
state 0 to state 1 given by (9) with the following one con-
nected to the reliability function (20):
r0(t) =
−dR(t | 0, M(0) = 0)/dt
R(t | 0, M(0) = 0)
=
νg(t)
1 − exp [−ν(1 − G(t))] .
The transition rates between the other states of the counting
process {M(t) | t ≥ 0} remain unchanged, however. This
can be seen by studying the reliability of the software after
the failure number i− 1 ≥ 1 has occurred at time ti−1. The
reliability in the interval (ti−1, ti−1 + x] is derived as
R(x | ti−1, M(ti−1) = i − 1)
= P (M(ti−1 + x) − M(ti−1) = 0 ∧ M(ti−1) = i − 1)

for i−1 ≥ 1. This result is identical to equation (4), the reli-
ability in the original NHPP model. Therefore, for i−1 ≥ 1
the transition rates ri−1(t) connected to equation (21) are
the same as in (9). Adapting the generic NHPP-I model
with mean value function (6) by zero-truncating the distri-
bution of N leads to a new family of SRGMs, which we
will refer to as “ﬁrst-stage truncated models”. The counting
processes connected to these models feature the common
structure shown in Figure 3.
Since r0(t) differs from all the other transition rates, the
model family does not belong to the class of NHPP models,
and M(t) does not follow a Poisson distribution. Rather,
the probability for M(t) = 0 is given by
P (M(t) = 0) =
exp [ν(1 − G(t))] − 1
exp (ν) − 1
,
while the probabilities for M(t) taking values greater than
zero are
P (M(t) = m)
