The “First” RFID Tag
 Steven Shepard claims 
that Mario Cardullo was 
the inventor of the 
first RFID Tag*.
 After a spring of 1969 
airplane ride in which he 
was seated next to an 
IBM engineer, “Cardullo 
sketched out the idea 
for the first RFID-like 
tag with dynamic 
memory.”
 Patent issued Jan-23-
1973.

 Actually, there were several earlier patents 
for RFID Interrogator/Transponder ID 
Systems.
− US Patent 3,299,424 - Interrogator-Responder 
System has a priority date of May-05-1965.
 However, none of these earlier patents 
utilized digital memory; they were analog in 
nature.
 Note that Cardullo’s first prototypes used 
core memory to store 16 bits of data.

Introducing the Musician with 
Perfect Pitch - John R. Wiegand
 Although he might very well have 
been a world famous symphony 
conductor, history remembers 
him as the man who invented and 
perfected the “Wiegand-Effect”.
 But, until now, nobody realized 
that he also invented a digital 
read/write Prox RFID system 
before anyone else.
 As Paul Harvey would say,
“Now, the rest of the story.”

Quote
 Milton Velinsky, John’s Business partner, told 
me that he demo’ed John’s Prox invention to 
ADT and they dismissed it as a magicians trick 
and doubted its viability.
 John’s Prox invention was never commercialized 
yet it was far ahead of its time.
− It used the same principle as today’s Prox – near field 
communications at 4.8 kHz.
− Data was stored on the wire sort-of-like bubble 
memory. 
− It was passive and drew power from the interrogator.
 But it could use a battery for longer communications.

Slide 18
Who Was John Wiegand?
 John was neither an engineer nor a physicist but 
was a musician by training.
 Born in Germany in 1912, John Wiegand came to the 
US in the 1930’s and studied piano and choral 
conducting at the Julliard School of Music in NY.
 While attending Julliard, he became interested in 
audio amplifiers and later became an engineering 
assistant for magnetic amplifiers at the Bell 
Telephone Laboratory.
 In 1944, he began working for Sperry Gyroscope 
Company in Lake Success, N.Y., and later for a 
Government contractor as a product developer of 
tape recorders.

Who Was John Wiegand? (cont.)
 In 1965, he started his relentless pursuit of 
magnetic research that led to the development and 
patenting of the Wiegand effect. 
 Before he had an oscilloscope to see pulses, it was 
his perfect pitch that enabled him to listen to the 
magnetic pulse produced by his wire through a 
loudspeaker.
 John always referred to the wires as “she” and said 
that the wires sung to him.
 John later met Milton Velinsky and together they
formed Wiegand Electronics to develop product
applications for the Wiegand Effect. 
 John did the inventing and Milt did the
promoting and selling.

 In 1992, Bill Payne, an employee of 
Sandia Labs was assigned to break 
electronic systems for the FBI.
 He found a way to expose the wires 
using Magnaview film and a cow 
magnet and then published this 
information.
 Even though he claims that this was 
not classified, the FBI thought 
otherwise.
 He was fired and is still trying to 
clear his name.

 Since 1978, I owe my livelihood to the 
electronic physical access control industry.
 In my humble opinion, I truly feel that 
John’s Wiegand Card Readers was the 
foundation of this industry as we know it 
today.
 Indeed, the Wiegand protocol is still used by 
the majority of access control readers.
 I once had the privilege of meeting John in 
his lab in Valley Stream, NY.

Dedication
 I will post fascinating material that I find at 
www.wiegand-effect.com
 A colleague of mine, Dr. Scott Guthery, planted 
the seed for me to write a book on the subject.
− However, based on the realization of how much 
research is required, I currently have no timetable 
for completion as I am still in data gathering mode
 Perhaps, next year, if DEFCON allows me to 
speak again, I can share more of John and his 
wonderful wires as well as demos of his devices 
and the physics behind his Wiegand Effect
