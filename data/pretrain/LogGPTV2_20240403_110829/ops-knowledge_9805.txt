Question: In the context of addressing a vulnerability related to IOCTL operations using METHOD_NEITHER, which of the following statements accurately reflects a trade-off when choosing an alternative I/O control method?
"A": "METHOD_BUFFERED can control the buffer size effectively but may introduce additional overhead due to copying data between user and kernel space.",
"B": "Avoiding validation altogether can save development time but may increase the risk of privilege escalation attacks.",
"C": "Enforcing strict access control might limit the attack surface but could also restrict legitimate use of the IOCTL by other system components.",
"D": "Implementing extensive user input sanitization can prevent buffer overflows but may not be necessary for trusted user environments."
Answer: AC
