Subject: Unexpected Behavior with "Replace All" Function in Version 0.201.0 on OS X Yosemite

Dear Support Team,

I am currently using Version 0.201.0 (0.201.0) on OS X Yosemite and have encountered an issue with the "Replace All" function.

### Issue Description:
When I use the "Replace All" feature, the output is not as expected. Here are the details:

#### Initial State:
- The text is displayed as follows:
  - Line 1: `foo`
  - Line 2: `bar`
  - Line 3: `baz`

#### After Clicking "Replace All":
- The first line is updated correctly, but the other lines remain unchanged:
  - Line 1: `expected_text`
  - Line 2: `bar`
  - Line 3: `baz`

#### Expected Result:
- All lines should be updated to the expected text:
  - Line 1: `expected_text`
  - Line 2: `expected_text`
  - Line 3: `expected_text`

### Conclusion:
I am unsure whether this behavior is a bug or by design. However, I thought it would be best to bring this to your attention for further investigation.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Matt
