Abstract—Smart meters can record ﬁne-grained power con-
sumption data and provide such data to the power supplier
through realtime communications. Although smart meters can
make power management more efﬁcient and fault-tolerant, they
also pose bigger threats to user privacy. Data from smart meters
contain ﬁne-grained power consumption information of home
appliances and thus can be used to infer the ON/OFF states of
home appliances. This problem has received some attention in
the literature; however, most of them focus on active power based
attacks. This paper focuses on reactive power and demonstrates
how attackers can exploit reactive power data to infer appliance
usage information. Experiments on real residential smart meter
data show that our proposed attack can identify the ON/OFF
events of home appliance with high accuracy. To protect users
against such attacks, a novel defense technique called Reactive
Power Obfuscation (RPO) is proposed. RPO can mask the
true reactive power demand from the smart meter by using a
capacitor to store and provide reactive power in a controlled
manner. We evaluate the performance of RPO based on real
household power consumption data. Evaluation results show that
the ON/OFF events of home appliances can hardly be revealed
from reactive power data when RPO is applied.

I. INTRODUCTION
Smart meters are being deployed in more and more house-
holds [1]. With low-cost microprocessors, solid-state circuits
and realtime communication ports, smart meters can measure,
store and automatically upload richer and more ﬁned-grained
power consumption data [2]. With such data,
the power
supplier will have better situation-awareness and make timely
responses, resulting in better energy efﬁciency and better fault
tolerance [3], [4].
The proliferation of smart meters also raises many security
and privacy concerns [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Home appliances
may have unique power consumption signatures. From the
ﬁne-grained power consumption data provided by smart me-
ters, one may be able to infer if a certain home appliance
is on or off based on its unique signature [10], [11]. From
the home appliance usage information, user behavior such as
doing laundry, cooking, or sleeping can be inferred [12].
Some researchers [10], [13], [11] proposed techniques to
identify the ON/OFF events of home appliance from the data
generated by smart meters, and exploit such information to
infer user behavior. Among them, some works [10], [11]
analyzed the household power usage data, and extracted some

user behaviors and habits through activity recognition and user
proﬁling. Greveler et al. [13] analyzed the power consumption
of televisions. With detailed power demand information of
different programs, they identiﬁed the program being played
by a television. The aforementioned attacks all rely on active
power to infer user behavior. Several defense techniques
against active power-based attacks have been proposed [14],
[15], [16]. They use load-controlled rechargeable batteries to
mask the active power consumption data from smart meters.
With these techniques deployed, the above active power-based
attacks can be mitigated.
Despite the large amount of work on active power-based
attacks and defenses, an open question that has received little
attention is whether the reactive power data alone measured
by smart meters can cause privacy leakage, and if so, how to
prevent such privacy leakage? This is an important problem
to study since most of today’s smart meters measure not only
active power but also reactive power.
In this paper, we identify a new attack which only leverages
the reactive power data of smart meters and show that reactive
power alone can still be exploited to breach user privacy. The
attack can extract reactive power-based appliance signatures
and then, based on each appliance’s unique signature, identify
the ON/OFF events of appliances from the load proﬁles mea-
sured by a smart meter. To mitigate privacy disclosure caused
by the new attack, we propose a novel technique to obfuscate
the reactive power measured by smart meters. The Reactive
Power Obfuscation (RPO) technique uses capacitors installed
within a user’s household to store and provide reactive power
in a controlled manner,
to smooth power ﬂuctuations, so
that the reactive power changes caused by the ON/OFF of
appliances are hidden from the smart meter.
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
• We are the ﬁrst
to propose a reactive power based
attack and demonstrate that reactive power data alone
from smart meters can be exploited to infer appliance
usage information and pose bigger threats to user privacy.
The attack is demonstrated with real residential power
consumption data, and is shown to be able to identify
appliances with high accuracy.
• We propose a novel RPO technique to address the privacy
concerns caused by reactive power. RPO uses capacitors
to store and provide reactive power through a novel con-

• We build a circuit simulator and evaluate the performance
of RPO using multiple privacy metrics. Evaluation results
based on real residential power consumption data show
that RPO can effectively prevent privacy leakage from
reactive power data.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces related work. Section III describes the system
model and the threat model. In Section IV, we present the
reactive power-based attack. Section V describes the proposed
RPO technique. Section VI evaluates the performance of RPO,
and Section VII concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
Since load monitoring techniques can be used to identify
the appliances based on their unique power consumption
characteristics, we ﬁrst present related work in nonintrusive
load monitoring before introducing related work in smart grid
privacy.
A. Nonintrusive Load Monitoring
Nonintrusive load monitoring techniques are algorithms that
can disaggregate a household’s electric load proﬁle to infer the
ON/OFF states of home appliance. For traditional electric grid,
many non-intrusive load monitoring techniques [17], [18], [19]
have been proposed to process power consumption data col-
lected from specialized sensors and identify appliances. They
basically rely on unique power consumption characteristics of
each appliance and use different signal processing techniques
and classiﬁcation algorithms to identify the appliances.
B. Smart Grid Privacy
With ﬁne-grained data provided by smart meters, traditional
attacks may pose bigger threats to user privacy. Privacy issues
caused by smart meters have been studied extensively in the
literature [20], [13], [10], [11]. Wang and Lu [20] gives an
overview of potential privacy threats of smart meter data
and gives a general idea of how such data can be used to
answer questions about users’ life. In [13], [10], [11], various
techniques have been proposed to identify appliance and
extract user activities and habits through activity recognition.

However, all these works rely on active power data. The attack
proposed in this paper only relies on reactive power data.
To protect user privacy, many privacy preserving techniques
have been proposed [21], [22], [23]. In [21], [22], smart meter
readings sent to the server are anonymized to protect user
privacy. Privacy-preserving techniques [23], [24], [25] can also
be applied to aggregate the meter data of nearby users so that
no individual user’s power consumption can be learned by
the server. However, all these works require interactions with
either a third party or other users and thus they bring additional
threats. Moreover, they require changes to smart meters and
the power control system and thus introduce extra cost.
To avoid interactions with any third party while preserving
user privacy, battery-based techniques have been proposed
[14], [15], [26]. They mask the true power demand of a
household by directing rechargeable batteries to charge and
discharge so that the net demand does not change too much.
However, their solutions can only be used to mask the active
power consumption of a household, and they cannot be used to
address reactive power-based privacy attacks. Different from
these existing works, the defense technique proposed in this
paper can protect users from reactive power-based attacks.
Active power and reactive power are orthogonal in the vector
space and they do not interfere with each other. Thus, our
solution can be combined with battery-based approaches to
deal with privacy leakage from smart metering data;
i.e.,
capacitor is used to store and provide reactive power data to
mask reactive power usage while battery is used to mask the
active power usage.
III. PRELIMINARIES
A. Load Proﬁles
Load proﬁles are time series of electric demand. Most recent
smart meters can measure and store very ﬁne-grained load
proﬁles with reactive power, such as GE I-210 meters [27] and
Landis+Gyr meters [28]. The load proﬁles used in this paper
are collected with a GE I-210 meter at three different types
of residences: two bedroom apartment (Apt 1), one bedroom
apartment (Apt 2) and a two-story house (H). Apt 1 consists
of two bedrooms, 1.5 bathrooms with two adults living in. Apt
2 consists of one bedroom and one bathroom with two adults
living in. H consists of four bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms, with
two adults and two kids living in.

The load proﬁles for Apt 1 were collected from June 1st to
30th, 2016. The load proﬁles for Apt 2 were collected from
February 8th to 22th, 2016. The load proﬁles for H were
collected from March 10th to 17th, 2016. All load proﬁles
contain reactive power at the granularity of one second. There
are 53× 24× 3600 = 4, 579, 200 records in our collected load
proﬁles. A three-day load proﬁle with reactive power from
June 20th to 22th, 2016 is shown in Fig. 1.
B. Reactive Power and Capacitor
In an Alternating Current (AC) circuit, both voltage and
current are sinusoidal. For resistive elements, the voltage and
current are always in the same phase, resulting in net transfer
of energy. This portion of energy is called active power (or
real power). For energy storage elements such as inductors
and capacitors, their voltage and current are always 90 degrees
out of phase. The energy ﬂowing to these elements is stored
and will ﬂow back to the source periodically, without any
net energy transfer. This portion of energy is called reactive
power. Most appliances consist of both resistive elements
and energy storage elements, and thus both active power and
reactive power ﬂow to loads. The vector sum of active power
and reactive power is called complex power, as shown in
Fig. 2.
As mentioned above, capacitors are energy storage elements
and do not really consume net power. They only cause
energy transfer between the power source and themselves. We
will explain how the capacitors cycle between providing and
storing power.
Let C denote the capacitance of the capacitor. In an AC
circuit with voltage source v(t) = V0 cos(ωt), based on the
power and current law, the current ﬂows through the capacitor
is:
i(t) = C
dv(t)
dt
ωCV0 sin(ωt) = ωCV0cos(ωt + 90
◦
)
According to the power deﬁnition, instantaneous power of the
capacitor can be calculated as:
p(t) = v(t)i(t) = ωCV
2
0 cos(ωt) cos(ωt + 90
◦
)
When p(t) is positive, the capacitor charges (storing power)
and when p(t) is negative, the capacitor discharges (providing
power).
C. Appliance Speciﬁcations
The targeted appliances in our three households are: lamp,
refrigerator, air conditioner, microwave oven, dishwasher, ket-
tle, laptop, and television. Their power consumption spec-
iﬁcations are listed in Table I. The above appliances are
chosen in our experiments because they are commonly used
in households. Since the signature extraction process is the
same for all appliances, the proposed attack is not limited to
the above appliances.
D. Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform
Fourier transform is a very important signal processing tech-
nique [29]. It decomposes a function of time into frequency
components. The Fourier transform ˆf of an integrable function
(cid:2) ∞
f (R → C) is deﬁned as:
−∞ f (x) e
dx,∀ ξ ∈ R.
ˆf (ξ) =
−2πixξ
An example of Fourier Transform on a time-domain signal
is shown in Fig. 3. We can see from the lower ﬁgure that
the original signal mainly consists of 200 Hz and 2100 Hz
components.
Different from Fourier transform which gives only fre-
quency information (what frequency components are in the
signal), wavelet transform can give both time and frequency
information: what frequency components are in the signal and
when these particular spectral components occur [30]. Wavelet
transform of an integrable function f is deﬁned as:
(cid:4)
(cid:2) ∞
−∞ ψ

[Wψf ] (a, b) =
f (x)dx.
−j is the binary dilation (scaling), and b =
