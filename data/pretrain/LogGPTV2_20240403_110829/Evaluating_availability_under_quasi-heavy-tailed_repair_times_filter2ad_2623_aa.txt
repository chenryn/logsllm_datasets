## Abstract
The time required to recover from failures significantly impacts the availability of Information Technology (IT) systems. We define a class of probability distributions called quasi-heavy-tailed distributions, characterized by intermittent jumps in the sample mean over a given period. Our analysis reveals that the repair time distribution for three IT systems—an in-house system hosted by IBM, a high-performance computing system at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), and a distributed memory computer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)—exhibits quasi-heavy-tailed behavior. This implies that the mean time to repair (MTTR) estimated within a specific period can vary dramatically if observed over a different period, leading to large fluctuations in MTTR over time. Consequently, traditional metrics based on MTTR are not optimal for evaluating the availability of these systems.

We propose using the T-year return value, estimated based on extreme value theory, as a more robust metric for evaluating system availability. The T-year return value represents the repair time that is exceeded, on average, once every T years. Our findings indicate that the T-year return value is a sound metric for assessing the availability of the three IT systems.

## 1. Introduction
High dependability is a critical requirement for IT systems, especially as they play increasingly important roles in business and government activities. To design and build highly dependable IT systems, it is essential to measure and evaluate their availability metrics, such as the frequency of failures and the average time to recover from them.

Significant research has been conducted on measuring and analyzing the statistics of repair times for IT systems. Long et al. [17] were among the first to systematically study the repair time distribution by polling Internet hosts periodically over three months, concluding that the repair time distribution deviates significantly from an exponential distribution. Schroeder and Gibson [21] analyzed nine years of repair time data from LANL's high-performance computing (HPC) systems and found that log-normal distributions model the repair times well. Additionally, many availability models have been proposed with non-exponential distributions, particularly phase-type distributions [22, 4, 15].

While prior work has focused on the overall distribution of repair times, there has been little research on long repair times, which are crucial for understanding the tail of the distribution. Long repair times can significantly impact the availability of IT systems. In this paper, we analyze the tail of the repair time distribution for three IT systems and find that the repair times exhibit quasi-heavy-tailed distributions. These distributions are characterized by sudden jumps in the sample mean over certain periods, leading to significant fluctuations in the estimated MTTR over time. Traditional metrics like the median do not adequately represent the availability of IT systems, necessitating new, robust, and intuitive metrics.

We propose using the T-year return value, derived from extreme value theory, to evaluate the availability of IT systems. The T-year return value provides an intuitive understanding of system availability, even when the repair time is quasi-heavy-tailed. It is defined as the repair time that is exceeded, on average, once every T years. This metric is useful for evaluating the failure risk of computer systems and identifying subsystems with high failure risk.

The contributions of this paper are twofold:
1. We analyze the statistical properties of repair times for three IT systems and find that they exhibit quasi-heavy-tailed distributions.
2. We propose the T-year return value as a new metric for evaluating system availability and show that it allows for a more robust assessment than classical metrics like MTTR.

## 2. Repair Time Analysis
### 2.1 Data and System Configuration
To analyze the statistical properties of repair times, we require incident data collected over a long period, especially for studying the tail of the distribution. We use data from three large IT systems, where incidents were systematically recorded in an incident management database over many years.

#### 2.1.1 In-House System
One data source is the repair time data from an in-house system hosted by IBM, running enterprise applications. The dataset includes 332 incidents from April 1, 2005, to February 27, 2006. Each record contains details such as incident description, occurrence and recovery times, and business impact level. We only included incidents that affected the system, as harmless incidents tend to have longer repair times due to less operator attention.

Incident records are created when an alert is detected by a monitoring system or when users report system unavailability. Operators then create a new record, input the incident description and start time, and update the record with each recovery step until the system recovers. To ensure data accuracy, we manually checked and removed incorrect entries.

#### 2.1.2 LANL HPC System
Another data source is from the LANL HPC system, consisting of 22 high-performance computing subsystems. We used 3,997 incidents from one subsystem (System ID 18, corresponding to System ID 7 in [21]) from May 6, 2002, to September 8, 2005. This subsystem has 1,024 nodes, each with four processors and varying memory sizes (8, 16, 32, and 352 GB).

#### 2.1.3 NERSC Seaborg System
The third data source is from the NERSC Seaborg system, a distributed memory computer used for scientific computing. We used data from 177 incidents from July 2, 2001, to December 21, 2006. The system consists of 380 computing nodes, each with 16 processors and shared memory pools ranging from 16 to 64 GB. The data includes the date and time of failures, outage causes, and failure descriptions.

### 2.2 Statistical Analysis Results
#### 2.2.1 Summary of Statistics
Table 1 summarizes the statistics for the three IT systems. While 75% of the incidents were repaired within a certain time, the data shows significant variations in repair times, indicating quasi-heavy-tailed behavior.

| System | # Incidents | Min. (min) | 1st Qu. (min) | Median (min) | Mean (min) | 3rd Qu. (min) | Max. (min) |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------------|--------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| In-House | 332 | 0.0 | 16.0 | 49.0 | 504.8 | 201.5 | 35400.0 |
| LANL HPC | 3997 | 1.0 | 28.0 | 58.0 | 179.4 | 142.0 | 25370.0 |
| NERSC Seaborg | 177 | 1.0 | 120.0 | 255.0 | 534.8 | 493.8 | 22230.0 |

Figure 1 shows the log-log plot of the complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDF) of the repair times for the three systems, along with a power-law distribution for comparison. The plots clearly demonstrate the quasi-heavy-tailed nature of the repair times.

## 3. Extreme Value Theory
Extreme value theory (EVT) is a statistical framework for modeling the maximum values of rare events. We use EVT to estimate the T-year return value, which is the repair time that is exceeded, on average, once every T years. This metric provides a robust and intuitive way to assess the availability of IT systems, especially when dealing with quasi-heavy-tailed distributions.

## 4. Analysis of T-Year Return Values
We analyze the T-year return values for the three IT systems and discuss the results. The T-year return values provide a more stable and reliable measure of system availability compared to traditional metrics like MTTR. The results show that the T-year return value is a sound and effective metric for evaluating the availability of the three IT systems.

## 5. Conclusions
In this paper, we analyzed the statistical properties of repair times for three IT systems and found that they exhibit quasi-heavy-tailed distributions. We proposed the T-year return value, derived from extreme value theory, as a new and robust metric for evaluating system availability. Our findings indicate that the T-year return value allows for a more accurate and intuitive assessment of system availability, making it a valuable tool for IT system designers and operators.
