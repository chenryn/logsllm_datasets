### Introduction

In recent times, the proliferation of malicious webpages has enabled hackers to deploy malware on a large scale, leading to significant data breaches in government agencies and private enterprises. To combat this growing threat, Armorize Technologies' X-Solve Lab research team has initiated a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment, focusing on websites within Taiwan. This report delves into the current state of malicious webpage attacks and associated malware, providing an in-depth technical analysis to highlight the extent of the issue.

### New Threat: Web-Based Malware

#### Web Security: A New Challenge

The advent of Web 2.0 has sparked a new wave of internet enthusiasm, but it has also introduced significant security challenges. Recent studies indicate a strong correlation between malware and web security threats. According to Google's research, one in ten websites is malicious, and out of 12 million malicious webpages, 1 million actively distribute malware. Additionally, every 2,000 webpages contain at least one that can inject malware.

#### Geographical Distribution of Malware Activity

Most malware activity is concentrated in China, the United States, Germany, and Russia. Notably, in April 2007, the Judicial Yuan in Taiwan was targeted by such an attack.

### What is a Malicious Webpage?

A **malicious webpage** is one that has been altered by hackers to include malicious code or links, compromising the security of users who visit the site. The primary goal is often to distribute spyware, steal sensitive information, or gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

#### Types of Malicious Code

- **Malicious Scripts (Malscript):** JavaScript or other scripts embedded in the webpage.
- **Exploits:** Code designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the user's environment.
- **Malicious Links (Malinks/Maliframes):** Links or iframes that redirect users to malicious sites.

#### Why Webpages Get Compromised

Web application security vulnerabilities, particularly SQL injection, are the most common entry points for hackers. The low cost and widespread availability of hacking tools and tutorials have made it easier for individuals to engage in cybercriminal activities.

### Common Exploits Used in Malicious Webpages

Most exploits target Microsoft environments, including:

- MS07-017: Windows Animated Cursor (.ANI) Remote Exploit
- MS07-009
- MS07-004: VML Remote Code Execution
- MS06-073
- MS06-071: XML Core Services Remote Code Execution
- MS06-068
- MS06-067
- MS06-057: WebViewFolderIcon ActiveX
- MS06-055
- MS06-014: MDAC Remote Code Execution
- MS06-013
- MS06-005
- MS06-004
- MS06-001

### Analysis of Malicious Webpages

#### Two Modes of Malicious Webpages

1. **Encoded Scripts:**
   - Encoded JavaScript used to generate HTML content.
   - Malicious scripts are often encoded to evade detection by antivirus software and intrusion detection systems. This technique is similar to those used by PE Packers.

2. **Malinks and Exploits:**
   - Malicious links and iframes that direct users to pages containing exploit code.
   - The exploit code then drops and executes malware on the user's system.
