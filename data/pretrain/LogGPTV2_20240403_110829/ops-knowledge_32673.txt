User: How to write a simple HTTP client to access a specific website using Python language?
Assistant: The following are the steps to write a simple HTTP client using Python language to access a specific website: Step 1: Import Python's built-in library and third-party library ``` import http.client ``` Step 2: Establish HTTP connection`` ` conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("www.example.com") ``` HTTPSConnection is used here, if you want to use HTTPConnection, you only need to change "https" to "http". Step 3: Send a GET request ``` conn.request("GET", "/") ``` Here "/" means the root path, if you want to visit other web pages, you can replace it with the corresponding path. Step 4: Get the response from the server ``` resp = conn.getresponse() ``` Step 5: Read the response content ``` resp_data = resp.read() ``` Step 6: Close the connection`` ` conn.close() ``` The complete code is as follows: ``` import http.client # Establish HTTP connection conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("www.example.com") # Send GET request conn.request("GET ", "/") # Get the server's response resp = conn.getresponse() # Read the response content resp_data = resp.read() # Close the connection conn.close() # Output the response data to the console print(resp_data.decode ()) ``` This implements a simple HTTP client to access a specific website.
