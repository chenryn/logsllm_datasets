ABSTRACT
Quantum entanglement enables important computing applications
such as quantum key distribution. Based on quantum entanglement,
quantum networks are built to provide long-distance secret sharing
between two remote communication parties. Establishing a multi-
hop quantum entanglement exhibits a high failure rate, and existing
quantum networks rely on trusted repeater nodes to transmit quan-
tum bits. However, when the scale of a quantum network increases,
it requires end-to-end multi-hop quantum entanglements in order
to deliver secret bits without letting the repeaters know the se-
cret bits. This work focuses on the entanglement routing problem,
whose objective is to build long-distance entanglements via un-
trusted repeaters for concurrent source-destination pairs through
multiple hops. Different from existing work that analyzes the tradi-
tional routing techniques on special network topologies, we present
a comprehensive entanglement routing model that reflects the dif-
ferences between quantum networks and classical networks as well
as a new entanglement routing algorithm that utilizes the unique
properties of quantum networks. Evaluation results show that the
proposed algorithm Q-CAST increases the number of successful
long-distance entanglements by a big margin compared to other
methods. The model and simulator developed by this work may
encourage more network researchers to study the entanglement
routing problem.

1 INTRODUCTION
Secure information exchange via quantum networks has been
proposed, studied, and validated since 1980s [5, 17ś19, 35, 38, 48,
59] and many experimental studies have demonstrated that long-
distance secrete sharing via quantum networks can become success-
ful in reality, such as the DARPA quantum network [18, 19], SEC-
OQC Vienna QKD network [38], the Tokyo QKD network [48], and
the satellite quantum network in China [59]. A quantum network
(also called a quantum Internet) is an interconnection of quantum
processors and repeaters that can generate, exchange, and process
quantum information [8, 10, 25, 57]. It transmits information in the
form of quantum bits, called qubits, and stores qubits in quantum
memories1. Quantum networks are not meant to replace the classi-
cal Internet communication. In fact, they supplement the classical
Internet and enable a number of important applications such as
quantum key distribution (QKD) [5, 17, 41], clock synchronization
[26], secure remote computation [7], and distributed consensus [15],
most of which cannot be easily achieved by the classical Internet.
Most applications of quantum networks are developed based on
two important features of quantum entanglement. 1) Quantum en-
tanglement is inherently private by the laws of quantum mechanics
such as the łno-cloning theoremž [37] and hence prevents a third
party from eavesdropping the communication [17]. Quantum en-
tanglement enables a perfect solution to the fundamental problem
of network security: key distribution (also known as key agree-
ment) [16]. Compared to public key cryptography [46], quantum
key distribution (QKD) has provable security in terms of informa-
tion theory and forward secrecy [57], instead of relying on the
computational complexity of certain functions such as factoriza-
tion. 2) Quantum entanglement provides strong correlation and
instantaneous coordination of the communication parties. Hence,
quantum entanglement can achieve tasks that are difficult to co-
ordinate in classical networks, and a well-known one is quantum
teleportation, as shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b). If a pair of entangled
qubits are shared by Alice and Bob, then Alice can send one bit of
secret information to Bob with the help of quantum measurement
1e.g., transmitting a pair of entangled photons and storing the entanglement state into
a pair of nitrogen-vacancy centers in two remote diamonds [11, 13]

and the classical Internet [45]. Hence, QKD can be achieved via
quantum entanglement.
We note that quantum networks will become practical in the
near future, and they do not rely on the success of well-functioning
quantum computers. Both academia and industry have a time-to-
time debate on when a practical quantum computer will be available
with a sufficient amount of qubits to implement the proposed quan-
tum algorithms, such as Shor’s integer factorization [50]. It seems
that well-functioning quantum computers might not become avail-
able in the near future. However, many applications of quantum
networks can be implemented with one or two qubits. Considering
the QKD example, we are able to distribute a secret bit with only
one entanglement pair. By repeating the 1-pair QKD process we
can generate secret keys with a sufficient length.
To generate a quantum entanglement between two parties Alice
and Bob, an entangled pair of photons are created, and each pho-
ton is sent to a party through a channel, such as an optical fiber.
However, the optical fiber is inherently lossy and the success rate
p of establishing an entanglement pair decays exponentially with
the physical distance between the two parties [42, 43]. Hence, to
increase the success rate of long-distance quantum entanglement,
a number of quantum repeaters need to be deployed between two
long-distance communication parties [43, 57]. Many existing quan-
tum networks [18, 38, 48, 59] rely on łtrusted repeatersž to relay
entanglements. Each trusted repeater gets the actual data qubit tele-
ported from the sender and teleports the data qubit to the receiver,
similar to the łstore-and-forwardž process in classical networks. A
more attractive approach is to use quantum swapping [6, 34, 35].
As shown in Fig. 1 (c) and (d), via entanglement swapping, a quan-
tum repeater that holds entanglements to both Alice and Bob can
turn the two one-hop entanglements into one direct entanglement
between Alice and Bob. Multi-hop swapping is also possible with a
path of repeaters holding entanglements with their predecessors
and successors. During quantum swapping, a repeater does not
know the qubit information hence it does not have to be trusted.
This work focuses on a key problem called entanglement routing,
whose objective is to build long-distance entanglements through
multiple hops of quantum repeaters and entanglement swapping,
even if the repeaters may be untrusted or corrupted [24, 36]. En-
tanglement routing has not been thoroughly investigated but is
necessary in future large-scale quantum networks: When a quan-
tum network scale increases, similar to the Internet, users do not
always trust all forwarding devices between the source and des-
tination or some trusted repeaters may be corrupted. In addition,
a large number of trusted repeaters increase the attack space and
the vulnerability of the whole system. Entanglement routing finds
an end-to-end path of concurrent quantum entanglement through
a number of repeaters and performs quantum swapping without
letting the repeaters know the data bits. This can be considered
on the network layer of a quantum network [13]. Existing works
that investigate the entanglement routing problem of quantum net-
works are limited to analyzing the traditional routing algorithms
(Dijkstra shortest paths, multipath routing, and greedy routing) on
special network topologies (ring, sphere, or grid), such as the very
recent ones [24, 36].
Similar to other network routing problems, entanglement routing
is a distributed algorithm design problem to utilize the underlying
link-layer models [13, 24, 36]. While the physical layer and link
layer studies of quantum networks require experimental valida-
tions on special and expensive hardware, the entanglement routing
algorithms can be comprehensively evaluated via simulations as
long as the link-layer model reflects the practical physical facts,
similar to prior studies for intra-/inter-domain routing, wireless
multi-hop routing [20], data center routing [3, 51, 60], etc.
To our knowledge, this is the first work of a comprehensive
protocol design specifically for entanglement routing in quantum
networks, with new models, new metrics, and new algorithms,
working on arbitrary network topologies. We present a compre-
hensive entanglement routing model that reflects the difference
between quantum networks and classical networks and propose
new entanglement routing designs that utilize the unique prop-
erties of quantum networks. We propose a few routing metrics
that particularly fit quantum networks instead of using hop-count
and physical distance. The proposed algorithms include realistic
protocol-design considerations such as arbitrary network topolo-
gies, multiple concurrent sources and destinations to compete for
resources, link state exchanges, and limited qubit capacity of each
node, most of which have not been considered by prior studies.
Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm Q-CAST in-
creases the number of successful long-distance entanglements by a
big margin compared to other known methods. More importantly,
this study may encourage more network researchers to study the
entanglement routing problem. We present and clarify the mod-
els and problems of entanglement routing, with the comparison
of similar terms and concepts used in classical network research.
A simulator with algorithm implementation, topology generation,
statistics, and network visualization functions is available on this
link [1].
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
the related work of quantum network routing and Section 3 in-
troduces the network model. We present the algorithm designs in
Section 4. The evaluation results are shown in Section 5. We discuss
some related issues in Section 6 and conclude this work in Section 7.
2 RELATED WORK
Quantum information exchange has been proposed, studied, and
validated for more than 20 years [5, 17, 18, 35, 38, 48, 59]. The
concept of quantum networks is first introduced by the DARPA
quantum network project aiming to implement secure communi-
cation in the early 2000s [18]. Recent implementations include the
SECOQC Vienna QKD network [38], the Tokyo QKD network [48],
and China’s satellite quantum network [59]. These experimental
works rely on trusted repeaters.
In order to design future large quantum networks in which re-
peaters may not trust each other, one fundamental problem is to
route quantum entanglements with high reliability in quantum
repeater networks [54]. Van Meter et al. studies applying Dijkstra
algorithm to repeater network [31]. Pirandola et al. discuss the
limits of repeaterless quantum communication [43] and propose
multi-path routing in a diamond topology [40]. Schoute et al. [49]
propose a framework to study quantum network routing. However,
their discussion is only limited to ring or sphere topology. Das et al.
[14] compare different special topologies for entanglement routing.
Caleffi [9] studies the optimal routing problem in a chain of re-
peaters. Pant et al. [36] propose solutions for entanglement routing

in grid networks. [24] proposes virtual-path based greedy routing
in ring and grid networks. Vardoyan et al. [55] study a quantum
entanglement switch in a star topology. All these studies assume
specialized network topologies such as a grid or ring, which may
be over-simplified. The topologies of practical quantum networks
may be arbitrary graphs because 1) the end hosts in quantum net-
works must exist on specified locations according to application
requirements, instead of following certain topologies; 2) deploying
unnecessary devices just to create a certain topology is a waste of
resource.
The above studies are limited to analyzing the traditional routing
algorithms on special network topologies. Compared to them, this
paper is the first work of a comprehensive protocol design specif-
ically for entanglement routing in quantum networks, with new
models, new metrics, and new algorithms, working on arbitrary
network topologies. It includes three unique improvements: 1) We
present a practical network model that clearly specifies the net-
work information that is locally known to each node, includes more
practical network topologies such as arbitrary network graphs, and
present locally executed protocols on every single node. 2) This
work considers concurrent source-destination pairs that may cause
contention on quantum links. Concurrent routing is one of the
most important design challenges of quantum networks because
each quantum link can only be used for one source-destination pair,
unlike packet switching. We believe our solution matches practical
quantum network applications. Prior methods are not specifically
designed for concurrent source-destination pairs and might become
sub-optimal in practical situations. 3) We propose a few routing
metrics that particularly fit quantum networks instead of using
hop-count and physical distance. These metrics are important to
select good paths in quantum networks and can also be used for
future studies.
Recently, Dahlberg et al. [13] provide a reference model of the
quantum network stack, which contains the physical layer, link
layer, network layer, and transport layer. Based on that, they provide
a reliable physical and link layer protocol for quantum networks
on the NV hardware platform. The routing algorithms proposed
in our paper fit in the ‘network layer’ [13] to provide the concur-
rent entanglement routing solutions, leveraging the services in the
quantum link layer.
3 NETWORK AND SECURITY MODELS
The network model used in this study follows the facts from ex-
isting physical experiments [6, 32, 34, 35] and the corresponding
studies [14, 36, 49] to reflect a practical quantum network. Com-
pared to prior models used in existing studies of quantum network
performance [14, 24, 36, 49], this model includes many practical con-
siderations, e.g. the dynamics of quantum links, definition and com-
parison of different routing metrics, concurrent source-destination
pairs, limited qubit capacity of each node, clear differentiation of
