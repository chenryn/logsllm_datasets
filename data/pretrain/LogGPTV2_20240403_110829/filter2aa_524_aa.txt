### Traffic Interception and Remote Mobile Phone Cloning with a Compromised CDMA Femtocell

**Presenters:**
- Doug DePerry
- Tom Ritter
- Andrew Rahimi
- iSEC Partners

**Important Notes:**
- The specific method used to access the device, which makes this demonstration possible, has been resolved by Verizon Wireless through a security patch.
- The Network Extenders used for the demonstration do not have the security patch installed.
- Verizon Wireless granted iSEC permission to use the network extenders for the demonstration in recognition of iSEC bringing the issue to their attention.

### Key Points:
- This is not like joining an open WiFi network; your phone automatically associates with no indication.
- You might be on our network right now.
- We are not hacking phones today; no user interaction is required.

---

### Full Disclosure:
- Vulnerabilities were disclosed to the carrier in early December.
- The carrier worked diligently over Christmas to prepare a patch.
- All vulnerabilities discussed in this presentation have been patched.
- We have architectural concerns around femtocells, which are shared by others in the industry.

### Our Focus:
- North American Carrier
- 3G
- CDMA
- Customers affected: Approximately one-third of the U.S. population
- Affected services: Phone calls, SMS, MMS, data man-in-the-middle attacks, SSL stripping, and cloning

### Agenda:
1. **Rooting the Femtocell(s)**
   - SCS-26UC4 (Older model)
   - SCS-2U01 (Newer model)
   - Hardware details:
     - Faraday FA626TE ARM v5TE processor on Samsung UCMB board
     - OneNAND flash memory
     - Lattice FPGA (presumably for DSP)
     - GPS and CDMA antennas
     - 2G/3G
     - Ethernet
     - HDMI Port
   - Console access via custom cable (USB FTDI + HDMI)
   - Wireless signal range: Approximately 40 feet, adjustable for environmental factors
   - Console access methods (no longer functional but may be useful for other embedded devices):
     - SCS-26UC4: 57600 8 N 1, Uboot delay, root shell, run /etc/init.d/rc 5
     - SCS-2U01: 115200 8 N 1, Magic sysreq + i, root login, run /etc/init.d/rc 5

2. **Exploring the Femtocell**
   - Operating system: MontaVista Linux 5, kernel 2.6.18
   - Custom kernel, drivers, and software
   - Filesystem: /mnt/onand, containing custom application binaries, keys, and passwords
   - Challenges: Limited terminal console, persistent filesystem location (/mnt/onand), and debugging mode setup

3. **Data Interception**
   - QuickSec VPN client as a Netfilter kernel module
   - Custom kernel module and userland app for packet capture and real-time data display
   - Voice, texts, and data interception
   - UDP packets, voice decoding, SMS, and data traffic manipulation

4. **Data Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**
   - Multiple attempts to intercept and manipulate data:
     - Inline kernel editing (failed due to transparent compression)
     - Changing HTTP version (ignored by the carrier)
     - DNS hijacking (failed due to transparent proxying)
     - Successful method: DNS hijack, port redirection, and SSL stripping

5. **Cloning**
   - Eavesdropping is significant, but impersonation is even more critical.
   - Details on cloning will be covered in the next section.

---

### Conclusion:
- The demonstration highlights the potential risks associated with compromised femtocells.
- Proper security measures and patches are essential to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
- Further research and collaboration are necessary to address the architectural concerns around femtocells.
