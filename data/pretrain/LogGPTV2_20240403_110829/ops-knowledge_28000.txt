User: I am running development web server in Google App Engine Launcher without any troubles. 
But I can't successfully stop it. When I am press Stop button, nothing happens. 
Nothing adds in logs after pressing Stop.
And after that I can't close launcher. 
The only way to close launcher is Task Manager.
Although when I am using dev_appserver.py myapp via cmd it is successfully stopped by Ctrl+C.
By the way I am under proxy.
Assistant: This is just a suggestion, but I think if you overloaded the server by repeatedly pinging the IP, you could crash the webserver.
