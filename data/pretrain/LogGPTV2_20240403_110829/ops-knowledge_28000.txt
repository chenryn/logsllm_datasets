I am currently running a development web server using the Google App Engine Launcher without any issues. However, I am unable to stop it successfully. When I press the "Stop" button, nothing happens, and there are no new entries in the logs. Additionally, I cannot close the launcher, and the only way to terminate it is by using the Task Manager.

Interestingly, when I run the `dev_appserver.py myapp` command via the Command Prompt, I can stop the server successfully using `Ctrl+C`.

For your information, I am operating behind a proxy.

**Assistant:**

Thank you for providing the details. It sounds like you're experiencing an issue with the Google App Engine Launcher not responding to the "Stop" command. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the problem:

1. **Check for Updates:** Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Google App Engine SDK and Launcher. Sometimes, these issues are resolved in newer releases.

2. **Proxy Configuration:** Since you mentioned that you are behind a proxy, ensure that the proxy settings in the Google App Engine Launcher are correctly configured. Incorrect proxy settings can sometimes cause unexpected behavior.

3. **Log Files:** Check the log files for any error messages or warnings that might provide more context about why the "Stop" button is not working. The log files are typically located in the `logs` directory within your project.

4. **Permissions and Antivirus:** Ensure that the Google App Engine Launcher has the necessary permissions to operate. Additionally, check if your antivirus or firewall software is blocking the launcher from stopping the server.

5. **Reinstall the Launcher:** If the issue persists, consider uninstalling and then reinstalling the Google App Engine Launcher. This can help resolve any corrupted files or configurations.

6. **Use Command Line:** As you've noted, using the `dev_appserver.py` command in the Command Prompt works well. You might want to continue using this method as a workaround until the issue with the launcher is resolved.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may want to report the bug to the Google App Engine support team, providing them with the details you've shared here.

Regarding the suggestion to overload the server by repeatedly pinging the IP, this is not a recommended approach as it can lead to unintended consequences and does not address the root cause of the issue.
