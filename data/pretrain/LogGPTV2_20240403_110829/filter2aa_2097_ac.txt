Xprobe2‟s abilities and its overall accuracy

Adding a Port Scanner
 The success of executing some of Xprobe2‟s fingerprinting 
modules depends on successfully probing an open TCP 
port and a closed UDP port
 Therefore we have implemented a port scanner module as 
an independent module to Xprobe2
 By default Xprobe2 does not tie the port scanner module 
with its fingerprinting modules and therefore it maintains 
the minimal usage of packets to discover a targeted 
system‟s underlying operating system

Adding a Port Scanner, Usage
 When the port scanner module is used, knowledge
about opened TCP ports, and closed UDP ports will be 
used as parameters for other modules
 For example, the port used for the TCP handshake 
module will be one that was already discovered as 
opened by the port scanner
 The TCP handshake module used TCP port 21 to 
perform its fingerprints although the “-p” option was 
not used. The port was discovered as opened by the 
port scanner

Adding a Port Scanner, Controlling the Sending Stream
 A command line option, “-s”, was added to control the 
sending stream of the port scanner module
 The command line controls the time interval between 
each SYN packet sent
 The value given is represented in milliseconds
 Controlling the stream of the port scan is an important 
feature, allowing one to adjust the paste of the scan, 
not allowing denial of service conditions to be 
introduced

Enhanced Receive Timeout Specifications 
 There are three receiving timeouts:
– Xprobe2 takes use of the ping discovery module in order to 
calculate the receiving timeout for its fingerprinting modules. The 
timeout used is the round-trip time of the ICMP echo request and 
reply times two (RTT*2) measured in miliseconds
– In order to allow a proper receive timeout for the ICMP echo 
discovery module itself, one can use the “-t” command line option 
and specify the receiving timeout in milliseconds
– The port scanner’s receiving timeout is calculated differently:
 (number of ports to scan *  ((sending delay defined)+10)) + RTT*2))
 If the number of received replies equals the number of ports scanned, 
the port scanner module will time out before the receiving timeout has 
been reached

The Ability to Totally Control Modules and Features of

 With the “-D” option one can specify which Xprobe2 
modules not to use
 With the “-M” option one can specify which Xprobe2 
modules to use
