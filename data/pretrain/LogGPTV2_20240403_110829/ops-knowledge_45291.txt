User: I've packaged a Kivy program that I made on OSX, but I also want to be able to distribute it for Windows and Linux. Is there currently a way of creating a Windows or Linux package from OSX? Or is there an ETA on when Buildozer will be able to create Windows packages?
Assistant: Your best bet will be to setup a VM for Windows and a VM for Linux, then create the packages for each OS within those VMs.
You might be able to use pyinstaller with Wine to make the Windows package directly on OSX - I have read that this can be done on Linux, so in theory it could work on OSX. But you will probably get better results using a VM where you can also test the package and make sure it installs and runs properly.
