Regarding the PHP bug [https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39992], the `proc_terminate` function, as used in `Process.php` at line 555, does not terminate child processes effectively.

To address this issue, I propose two potential solutions:

1. Implement the workaround described in the PHP manual for the `proc_terminate` function: [http://php.net/manual/en/function.proc-terminate.php].
2. Alternatively, follow the approach suggested by "mast at imast dot ru" in the bug report on php.net, which involves grouping process IDs (PIDs) to ensure that all child processes are terminated.

Either of these solutions should help resolve the problem and ensure that child processes are properly terminated.
