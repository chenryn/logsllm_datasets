As of PHP bug https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39992, proc_terminate, used in
Process.php @ line 555 does not terminate children process.
I propose either use a fix described in
http://php.net/manual/en/function.proc-terminate.php , or grouping pids as
"mast at imast dot ru" described in the php.net bug itself.
