Abstract—Mobile devices increasingly function as wireless
tracking beacons. Using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) pro-
tocol, mobile devices such as smartphones and smartwatches
continuously transmit beacons to inform passive listeners about
device locations for applications such as digital contact tracing
for COVID-19, and even ﬁnding lost devices. These applications
use cryptographic anonymity that limit an adversary’s ability
to use these beacons to stalk a user. However, attackers can
bypass these defenses by ﬁngerprinting the unique physical-layer
imperfections in the transmissions of speciﬁc devices.
We empirically demonstrate that there are several key chal-
lenges that can limit an attacker’s ability to ﬁnd a stable physical
layer identiﬁer to uniquely identify mobile devices using BLE,
including variations in the hardware design of BLE chipsets,
transmission power levels, differences in thermal conditions, and
limitations of inexpensive radios that can be widely deployed
to capture raw physical-layer signals. We evaluated how much
each of these factors limits accurate ﬁngerprinting in a large-scale
ﬁeld study of hundreds of uncontrolled BLE devices, revealing
that physical-layer identiﬁcation is a viable, although sometimes
unreliable, way for an attacker to track mobile devices.
I. INTRODUCTION
The mobile devices we carry every day, such as smart-
phones and smartwatches, increasingly function as wireless
tracking beacons. These devices continuously transmit short-
range wireless messages using the Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) protocol. These beacons are used to indicate proximity
to any passive receiver within range. Popular examples of
such beacons include the COVID-19 electronic contact tracing
provided on Apple and Google Smartphones [10] as well
as Apple’s intrinsic Continuity protocol, used for automated
device hand-off and other proximity features [1].
However, by their nature, BLE wireless tracking beacons
have the potential to introduce signiﬁcant privacy risks. For
example, an adversary might stalk a user by placing BLE
receivers near locations they might visit and then record the
presence of the user’s beacons [3], [37]. To address these
issues, common BLE proximity applications cryptographically
anonymize and periodically rotate the identity of a mobile
device in their beacons. For instance, BLE devices periodically
re-encrypt their MAC address, while still allowing trusted
devices to determine if these addresses match the device’s
true MAC address [6]. Similarly, COVID-19 contact tracing
applications regularly rotate identiﬁers to ensure that receivers
cannot link beacons from the same device over time [2].
While these mechanisms can foreclose the use of beacon
content as a stable identiﬁer, attackers can bypass these
countermeasures by ﬁngerprinting the device at a lower layer.
Speciﬁcally, prior work has demonstrated that wireless trans-
mitters have imperfections introduced in manufacturing that
produce a unique physical-layer ﬁngerprint for that device
(e.g., Carrier Frequency Offset and I/Q Offset). Physical-layer
ﬁngerprints can reliably differentiate many kinds of wireless
chipsets [14], [9], [18], [35], [29], [21], [28], [8], including a
recent attempt to distinguish 10,000 WiFi [19] chipsets.
To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has evaluated
the practicality of such physical-layer identiﬁcation attacks
in a real-world environment. Indeed, prior to BLE track-
ing beacons, no mobile device wireless protocol transmitted
frequently enough—especially when idle—to make such an
attack feasible. Additionally, there is no existing BLE ﬁnger-
printing tool that can measure the physical-layer imperfections
in BLE transmissions (i.e., CFO and I/Q offset) accurately.
Prior techniques for ﬁngerprinting either provide low precision
ﬁngerprints because they use short duration (e.g., transient)
signal features, or provide high precision ﬁngerprints but
require long duration signal features which exist only in
protocols like WiFi but not in BLE. Our ﬁrst contribution is a
tool that uses a novel method to recover these imperfections
by iteratively adding imperfections to a re-encoded clean copy
of a received packet, until they match the imperfections of the
received packet over the air (Section III).
Our next contribution is an evaluation of how practical it is
for an attacker to track BLE-beaconing devices using their RF
ﬁngerprint. Namely, using lab-bench experiments, we identify
four primary challenges to identifying BLE devices in the
ﬁeld: (1) BLE devices have a variety of chipsets that have
different hardware implementations, (2) applications can con-
ﬁgure the BLE transmit power level, resulting in some devices
having lower SNR BLE transmissions, (3) the temperature
range that mobile devices encounter in the ﬁeld can introduce
signiﬁcant changes to physical-layer impairments, and (4) the
low-cost receivers that an attacker can use in the wild for RF
ﬁngerprinting are not signiﬁcantly less accurate than the tools
used in prior studies [9].
Our ﬁnal contribution is a set of ﬁeld experiments to eval-
uate how signiﬁcantly these challenges diminish an attacker’s
ability to identify mobile devices in the ﬁeld. We leverage
the fact that BLE tracking beacons are already used on many
mobile devices to perform an uncontrolled ﬁeld study where
we evaluate the feasibility of tracking BLE devices when they
are operating in public spaces where there are hundreds of
other nearby devices. To the best of our knowledge, our work
is the ﬁrst to evaluate the feasibility of an RF ﬁngerprinting

We show that even when there are hundreds of devices we
encountered in the ﬁeld, it is still feasible to track a speciﬁc
mobile device by its physical-layer ﬁngerprint. However, we
also observe that certain devices have similar ﬁngerprints
to others, and temperature variations can change a device’s
metrics. Both of these issues can lead to signiﬁcant misidenti-
ﬁcation rates. In summary, we ﬁnd that physical layer tracking
of BLE devices is indeed feasible, but it is only reliable under
limited conditions, and for speciﬁc devices with extremely
unique ﬁngerprints, and when the target device has a relatively
stable temperature. The dataset and code that we used to
perform this evaluation can be found at:

II. BLE DEVICE TRACKING THREAT MODEL
In this section we describe the threat model of location
privacy attacks on BLE-enabled mobile devices. Then, we
demonstrate how location privacy attacks are a signiﬁcant
threat today because popular mobile devices continuously, and
frequently, transmit BLE advertisements.
A. Threat model: Passively ﬁngerprinting BLE transmissions
An attacker wants to detect when their target—a user with a
mobile device—is present at a speciﬁc location (e.g., a room in
a building). To do so, ﬁrst the attacker must isolate the target
to capture a ﬁngerprint of its wireless transmissions. Then it
must ﬁnd features that uniquely identify the target, namely the
unique physical-layer features of the device’s BLE transmitter
hardware. Then, the attacker sets up a receiver in the location
where they want to see if the transmitter is there and passively
sniffs for the target’s BLE transmissions. They will know
when the target device is near the receiver when it captures
one or more packets that matches the target’s physical layer
ﬁngerprint. The more frequently the BLE device transmits,
the more likely the attacker is to receive a transmission if
a user passes by. Also, the more accurate the ﬁngerprinting
technique is, the better the attacker can differentiate the target
from other nearby devices. Fingerprinting bypasses MAC ad-
dress randomization [7], [26], BLE’s existing defense against
tracking.
To perform a physical-layer ﬁngerprinting attack, the at-
tacker must be equipped with a Software Deﬁned Radio
sniffer: a radio receiver capable of recording raw I/Q radio
signals. Although, as we show in Section IV-D, it is sufﬁcient
to use a modest hobbyist-level SDR (∼$150).
B. Extent of threat: Popular mobile devices are vulnerable
Increasingly, mobile devices are adding BLE beacons to
provide new features. Most notably, during the COVID-19
pandemic, governments have installed software on iPhones
and Android phones to send constant BLE advertisements
for digital contact tracing: devices listen for nearby trans-
missions to determine if and for how long another device
was nearby. Also, Apple and Microsoft operating systems
have recently added BLE beaconing to their devices for two

inter-device communication features: lost device tracking, and
seamless user switching between devices (e.g., Apple’s Conti-
nuity Protocol, Microsoft’s Universal Windows Platform) [5].
Therefore, BLE beacons are now common on many mobile
platforms, including: phones, laptops, and smartwatches.
Fingerprinting and tracking a BLE device requires the de-
vice to act like a tracking beacon: it must transmit continuously
and frequently. We observed the BLE behavior of popular
devices to determine if they transmit continuously, and how
frequently they transmit if they do. Speciﬁcally, we isolated
six popular devices in a Faraday cage—ensuring they were the
source of the transmissions—and we used an SDR sniffer to
collect all BLE advertisements (i.e., BLE beacons) transmitted
on any of the three advertising channels.
Mobile devices send BLE beacons continuously: We ob-
