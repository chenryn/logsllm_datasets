Question: In a browser-based challenge-response protocol where a server sends a random challenge \(r\) to the user's browser, the browser then computes \(H(w,r)\) using a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA256) and sends the result back to the server. What potential security issues are NOT addressed by this protocol that are otherwise mitigated by using SSL/TLS?
"A": "The userâ€™s password is exposed to the server in plaintext form.",
"B": "Encryption of the data in transit between the browser and the server may be weaker or nonexistent.",
"C": "The server's identity is not authenticated, which could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
"D": "The protocol may not secure data after authentication, leaving the session vulnerable to other forms of eavesdropping."
Answer: BCD
