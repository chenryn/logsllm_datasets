When using the conventional webpack 2+ dynamic imports, everything works great
in dev but breaks in production (with builds).
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
## Current Behavior
A bug: dynamic imports should work in production as well as they do in
development.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Pull down this example nextjs app to reproduce
  2. `yarn dev` to see it working in dev
  3. `yarn build` then `yarn start` to spin up the production build
## Context
I am trying to code-split my app and some of my dynamic imports are NOT
components. So using `next/dynamic` is not appropriate...
