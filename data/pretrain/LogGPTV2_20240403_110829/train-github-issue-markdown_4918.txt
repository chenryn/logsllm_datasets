When viewing a navbar menu on my iPhone, the whole navbar menu is presented as
a long list (by clicking on the icon in the top right) - which is expected as
there isn't enough room to show it conventionally.
If the menu contains dropdown items, these expand when they are clicked on,
and fold out as expected.
However, when clicking on the menu item within the dropdown, the dropdown
collapses again, meaning the item isn't selectable.
Everything works fine in a desktop browser, but not on my iPhone or Android
devices.
Is this a known issue? I can't imagine it isn't!
You can see the functionality I'm talking about on my website:
