in which all link failures are independent and the maximum
number of link failures is restricted. However, our theory is
developed for any probabilistic distribution of failures that
includes node failures, shared-risk link groups as well as
chained failures.
II. PRELIMINARIES
We view a network as a directed (multi-)graph, in which the
vertices represent nodes of the network and edges represent
links from one node to another.
Deﬁnition 1 (Network). A network is a directed (multi)-
graph G = (cid:2)V, E, src, dst(cid:3) consisting of a ﬁnite set of nodes
(vertices) V , a ﬁnite set of links (edges) E, a source mapping
function src : E (cid:4)→ V and a target mapping function
dst : E (cid:4)→ V .
We regard a network as a service that provides connectivity
between nodes to tenants (henceforth simply called customers)
by choosing a path from some node s (the source), to a node
t (the target).
Deﬁnition 2 (Path). Given a network G = (cid:2)V, E, src, dst(cid:3),
a path is a sequence of links σ = σ1σ2 ···σ n ∈ E+ where
|σ| = n such that dst(σi) = src(σi+1) for all i, 1 ≤ i  k and

In Section IV we discuss how independent causes of fail-
ures, each with their own distribution, can be convoluted into a
combined failure distribution, and how the hazard value which
we deﬁne in Section III is compositional with respect to this
convolution.
III. DEFINITION OF THE HAZARD VALUE
We shall now deﬁne the connectivity requirements, provide
a formal deﬁnition of the hazard value and instantiate the
deﬁnition to our running example.
A. Connectivity Requirements
When we consider the actual computation of the hazard
value, we usually ﬁnd that realistic routing scenarios can
be captured as regular expressions over E. For example, to
describe that all routes in a network must traverse some link
∗. Similarly, to describe that all
e, we can write R = E
∗ · e· E
Considering a network as a service, a customer (or tenant)
may express a demand X for connectivity and assign a certain
weight w to (or offer a reward for) the connection of a pair of
nodes (s, t) that satisfy this demand. The weight then indicates
the importance of having that demand met through a route

from s to node t. In this paper we denote this by WX (s, t) =
w. In the face of failures, it may be possible that the missing
connectivity between s and t can be replaced by sending the
(cid:2) to an alternative target t
(cid:2).
trafﬁc from an altenative source s
(cid:2) for such alternative
The customer may also specify a weight w
connections, usually smaller than the weight w if the customer
has a preference for the original connection. This ultimately
leads to a function WX : V × V → R
≥0 representing the
demand reward of X.
In our running example, the Internet trafﬁc generated at
one of the leaf nodes li is intended to be delivered to core
(cid:2). Hence
c, but can alternatively also be delivered to core c
for every i where (cid:2)i is a leaf node we deﬁne the demand
(cid:2),
reward as Wi(x, y) = 3 if x = (cid:2)i and y = c or y = c
and W(i,I)(x, y) = 0 elsewhere. The value 3 is the weight of
having such a connection (the higher the value the higher is
the importance of having the connection).
Given a weight function WX, the network operator attempts
to maximize the weight by providing the best route possible
in case of failures. For an implemented route σ ∈ E+ starting
(cid:2), we overload notation and simply deﬁne
in v and ending in v
(cid:2)
) to denote the weight associated with
WX (σ) = WX (v, v
the start and end point of σ. For implementing a set of routes
S ⊆ E+, the obtained weight for a customer X then is written
as WX (S) = maxσ∈S WX (σ). Given a routing language R
in the face of a failure scenario F , the obtained weight for X
is then WX (R ∩ Paths F ).
Finally, a network may serve multiple customers, or multiple
demands from the same customer. In our running example,
there is trafﬁc expected between each of the leaf nodes in the
same site and from each of the leaf nodes to the Internet. We
deﬁne a separate weight function for each of these demands
given by the set D, leading to a family of weight functions
WX indexed by the set of individual demands X ∈ D.
Deﬁnition 6 (Connectivity requirement). On a network G =
(cid:2)V, E, src, dst(cid:3), aconnectivity requirement
is a (ﬁnite) family
W = {WX : V × V → N | X ∈ D} of weight functions over
an index set D of all demands.
As mentioned in the introduction, we consider as inputs to
our metric: a network G, a routing language R, a DFP φ, and
a family WX of weight functions indexed over a set X ∈ D
of demands. We call such an input a connectivity scenario.
Deﬁnition 7 (Connectivity scenario). A connectivity scenario
S = (cid:2)G, R, φ, W, D(cid:3), consists of a network G, routing
language R, distribution of failure probabilities φ, and con-
nectivity requirement W over an index set D.
B. The Hazard Value
Given a connectivity scenario, the network operator tries to
optimize the sum of the weights of each of the individual
customers considering the distribution of failures. In other
words, the network operator tries to optimize the expected
connectivity weight.
Deﬁnition 8 (Expected connectivity weight). Given a con-
nectivity scenario (cid:2)G, R, φ, W, D(cid:3), the expected connectivity
weight is given by
(cid:5)
(cid:5)
φ(F ) · WX (R ∩ Paths F ) .
μ(G, R, φ, W, D) =
F⊆E
X∈D
(cid:3)
We can express the expected efﬁciency of a network as a
percentage by dividing the expected connectivity weight by the
maximum achievable weight in case all endpoints are con-
In
nected: μ(G, R, φ, W, D)/
practice, as we strive to get the expected efﬁciency close
to 1, we obtain a more human-readable metric if we consider
instead the hazard value, i.e., the expected loss of efﬁciency
due to connection failures.
Deﬁnition 9 (Hazard value). Given a connectivity scenario
(cid:2)G, R, φ, W, D(cid:3) its hazard value is deﬁned as:
X∈D maxv,w∈V WX (v, w).
γ(G, R, φ, W, D) = 1 −
(cid:3)
μ(G, R, φ, W, D)
X∈D maxv,w∈V WX (v, w)
.
Hence if the hazard value is 0, we expect no connectivity
loss in the given connectivity scenario and a value higher than
0 gives the potential percentage loss of connectivity reward
due to failures in the network.
C. The Hazard Value of the Operators Distributed Datacenter
Let us now consider an application of the hazard value
for the datacenter network in Figure 1. The operator aims
to improve the connectivity of this network by investing in
an additional link that can connect the two distributed parts
of the datacenter. The operator has the following information
about the current network:
• The network G topology is given in Figure 1.
• The routes R in the network are “valley-free”, meaning
that
trafﬁc originating from a leaf is ﬁrst only for-
warded upward in the datacenter hierarchy (if at all)
and subsequently (if at all) only routed downward to
its destination. Trafﬁc originating from a core switch is
only routed downwards and trafﬁc from leaves to core
this is achieved by splitting
only upwards. Formally,

indexes
1 ≤ i, j ≤ 4 with i (cid:10)= j there is medium demand
(assigned the weight 10) of trafﬁc both in the left site
and in the right site given by W(li,lj )(x, y) = 10 if
x = li and y = lj, and W(li,lj )(x, y) = 0 otherwise, and
(cid:2)
j, and
similarly W(l
W(li,lj )(x, y) = 0 otherwise.
The demand rewards for the trafﬁc between leaves and
core routers in the left-hand part of the datacenter are
given by W(li,{c,c
) =
15 and W(li,I)(x, y) = 0 otherwise, for any 1 ≤ i ≤ 4.
This assigns a higher reward of 20 for maintaining the
connection to the core router c and a lower reward of
(cid:2)
that is located in the right-
15 for the core router c
hand part of the datacenter. In the right-hand site, the
demand for Internet trafﬁc is less, and there is no rout-
ing preference between the core routers, expressed by

or y = c
1 ≤ i ≤ 4.
Between the other nodes in the network, no trafﬁc is
generated, and no weight functions are needed to describe
the demand. In particular, the spine switches and cores
do not generate any trafﬁc themselves, and there is no
leaf-to-leaf connectivity requirement across sites.
Given this datacenter network and conﬁguration, we compute
the hazard value to be 1.21349· 10
−4, meaning that we expect
a 0.01213% loss of reward due to failure in the network,
compared to the reward gained by a fully connected network.
The operator has two options how to increase the connec-
tivity of the network:
(cid:2).
1) Scenario 1: Add a link from s2 to c
(cid:2)
1 to c.
2) Scenario 2: Add a link from s
Computing the hazard value for the two options, the operator
obtains an expected 0.01203% reward loss for Scenario 1
and 0.01205% reward loss for Scenario 2, both of them
clearly improving the expected loss in the current network
topology. Hence, as intuitively expected, both additions lead
to an improvement of the dependability of the network, but
adding an extra link from the left part of the datacenter where
there is more trafﬁc towards the core routers (reﬂected by a
higher weight) is more beneﬁcial as it causes a more signiﬁcant
drop in the hazard value and hence allows for more reliable
operation of the datacenter.
In the next section, we shall substantiate the intuition that
adding links leads to a decrease in hazard value, as part of
our results regarding expected mathematical properties of the
metric.
IV. MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES AND ANALYSIS
In this section we establish monotonicity and composition-
ality properties of the hazard value.
A. Monotonicity
As indicated, the hazard value is intended for comparing
different network layouts, different routing strategies, different
the hazard value
DFP, and changing demands. Intuitively,
should not increase when edges or nodes are added to a net-
work, as long as the remaining connectivity scenario remains
the same. Also, when routing restrictions are lifted, or failure
probabilities decrease, one expects the hazard value not to
increase. When additional sources of failure are considered,
hazard values may increase. And ﬁnally, when certain links in
