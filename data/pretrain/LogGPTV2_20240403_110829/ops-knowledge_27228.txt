User: Please describe the common types of security vulnerabilities, how to use these vulnerabilities to attack the system, and provide corresponding preventive measures.
Assistant: 1. SQL injection attack: Attackers use improper use of input fields to insert malicious code into SQL statements, thereby bypassing authentication or directly operating the database. Preventive measures include using parameterized queries, limiting input length, filtering illegal characters and other security measures. 2. Cross-site scripting attack (XSS): The attacker exploits the vulnerability in the web application to inject malicious scripts into the victim's browser to obtain sensitive information of the user. Preventive measures include filtering, escaping, and limiting input data; setting the HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript from accessing cookies, and more. 3. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): Attackers achieve the purpose of attack by tampering with user requests, such as sending malicious requests, redirecting users to fraudulent pages, and stealing user information. Preventive measures include security measures such as using authentication tokens, using verification codes, and checking Referer header information. 4. Insecure file upload: Attackers attack web applications by uploading malicious files, such as uploading a web shell with malicious code to gain control of the web server system. Preventative measures include limiting the size and type of uploaded files, authorizing trusted users to upload files, performing antivirus scans on uploaded files, and more. 5. Security authentication issues: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication process to violate access control policies, such as password guessing, session fixation, and password reset issues. Preventative measures include requiring strong passwords, implementing multi-factor authentication, limiting failed login attempts, and more. 6. Instruction injection attack: Attackers use vulnerabilities in applications to insert malicious instructions into system command lines or shell scripts to perform malicious operations. Precautions include limiting input characters and number, filtering special characters, using access control lists, and more.
