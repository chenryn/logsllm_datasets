error (i.e., the distance between the real target location and the
location estimated by the sensor network), respectively. The
inner-circle solution provides a six-fold reduction in detection
latency, and between a four-fold and ﬁve-fold reduction in lo-
calization error (for inner-circle sizes over four nodes).
In conclusion, the inner-circle approach provides notably
improved performance in the considered conﬁguration and
fault models. While this result is signiﬁcant, we cannot ex-
pect the same improvement if node density is sparse or, al-
ternatively, if the signal emitted by the target is weak and is
detected only by very few neighboring nodes (e.g., 1–2). To
study this point further, we have re-run the experiments while
using a weaker target signal (K · T = 10000). Apart from the
miss alarm probability, all considered metrics show an im-
provement similar to that of Fig. 8. The miss alarm prob-
ability, however, increases up to 2-5% for inner-circle sizes
greater than ﬁve nodes, where the worst cases correspond to
signal interference and stuck-at-zero fault modes.
6. Related Work
Providing availability despite crashes and node movement
has been investigated by a number of researchers who have
attempted to migrate fault tolerance techniques for distributed
systems (e.g., replication, group communication, checkpoint-
ing) to the wireless domain [24–26]. Because of their
complexity (heavy interaction between non-neighbor nodes),
these techniques have rarely been extended to more complex
failure models (e.g., data corruption, Byzantine faults) [27].
Providing security guarantees (e.g., integrity, authentica-
tion, authorization) is the goal of a signiﬁcant body of liter-
ature in wireless ad hoc networks (including wireless sensor
networks). However, only a few studies have started to inves-
tigate the protection of wireless environments against internal
attacks [28, 29].
In [29], intrusion tolerance is attempted by means of ad-
mission control and threshold cryptography. In order to par-
ticipate in the network, a node must acquire a token (in prac-
tice, a certiﬁcate) from its neighbors. The token is collectively
signed by K neighbors (through threshold cryptography) and
must be renewed periodically. The scheme presupposes a lo-
cal intrusion-detection module running on each node and, un-
der the assumption that a malicious node n is eventually de-
tected by a sufﬁcient number of its neighbors, guarantees that
malicious node n is eventually denied access to the network
(its neighbors will revoke its token). The scheme fails if a ma-
licious node changes its neighborhood before being detected
and convicted by its previous neighbors. Consequently, the
network may be left vulnerable to attacks for arbitrarily long
periods—consider, for instance, a malicious node n that in-
jects malicious attacks intermittently while roaming the net-
work. It could be argued that the proposed inner-circle ap-
proach shares notions of threshold cryptography and localized
message signing with [29]. A signiﬁcant difference, though,
is to be found in the masking nature of inner-circle voting,
which prevents erroneous data propagation and, hence, avoids
the problems of [29].
The concept of intrusion and fault tolerance has been ex-
tensively studied in the context of distributed systems and has
resulted in a number of prototypes [15, 30, 31]. The inner-
circle consistency approach differs substantially from these
techniques, as it is speciﬁcally designed for mobile wire-

less environments. Typical intrusion and fault tolerance tech-
niques forcibly replicate data and computation on multiple
nodes in order to mask errors/intrusions in a server applica-
tion run on these nodes. In contrast, inner-circle consistency
leverages the partially replicated data/computation that is nat-
urally available in a locality of a sender node to neutralize
errors/attacks originating from that node.
7. Conclusions
This paper proposes the notion of inner-circle consistency
to protect wireless ad hoc networks from errors and attacks.
Through local node interaction, errors/attacks are neutralized
at the source, both preventing their propagation in the wire-
less network and improving the ﬁdelity of the propagated in-
formation. Thus, an unreliable and insecure wireless network
is transformed into a dependable network substrate on top of
which applications beneﬁt from improved network reliability
and security. This goal is achieved by combining statistical (a
proposed fault-tolerant cluster algorithm) and threshold cryp-
tography techniques with application-aware checks to exploit
the data/computation that is partially and naturally replicated
in wireless applications. A formally speciﬁed inner-circle
framework is prototyped with the ns-2 network simulator and
used to demonstrate the idea of inner-circle consistency in two
signiﬁcant wireless scenarios: (1) the neutralization of black
hole attacks in AODV networks and (2) the neutralization of
sensor errors in a target detection/localization application ex-
ecuted over a wireless sensor network.
