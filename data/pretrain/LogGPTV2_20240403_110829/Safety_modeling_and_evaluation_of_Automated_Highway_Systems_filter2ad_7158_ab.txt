Stop  (CS,  where  the  faulty  vehicles  uses  maximum 
emergency  braking),  and  Aided  Stop  (AS,  where  the 
faulty  vehicle  is  stopped  by  the  vehicle  immediately 
ahead).  Specific  control  laws  are  then  used  to  ease 
congestion, divert traffic away from the incident, assist 
emergency vehicles, and get the queued vehicles out.  
The  severity  classes  (B  and  C)  include  the  failure 
modes  that  can  be  recovered  by  allowing  the  faulty 
vehicle to get out of the highway without stopping the 
traffic. The  corresponding maneuvers  can be  achieved 
either  without  assistance  or  with  the  cooperation  of 
some  adjacent  vehicles.  Three  maneuvers  are  defined 
too,  namely:  Take  Immediate  Exit-Escorted  (TIE-E), 
Take  Immediate  Exit  (TIE),  Take  Immediate  Exit-
Normal (TIE-N). 
It 
that 
is  noteworthy 
the  severity  class  also 
determines the priority of the corresponding maneuver. 
This  is  important  when  multiple  failure  modes  occur. 
The priorities within each class are as follows: Within 
Class A, A3 has the highest priority and A2 has higher 
priority  than  A1.  In  Class  B,  B1  and  B2  have  equal 
priority.  In  case  of  occurrence  of  multiple  failure 
modes  in  the  same  vehicle,  the  maneuver  with  the 
highest priority is applied.  
Details  about  the  atomic  maneuvers  composing 
each of the six maneuvers presented in Table 1 and the 
inter-vehicle coordination required to implement them, 
are presented in [15]. 
The successive failure of maneuvers may eventually 
lead  to  a  state  where  no  maneuvers  are  available  to 
recover  the  faulty  situation.  This  is  illustrated  by  the 
state machine in Figure 2, where v_KO  identifies such 
a state. The transitions correspond to the occurrence of 
failure modes, or to the results of maneuver executions 
that might succeed (transitions to the safe state, v_OK) 
or  fail  (KO  transitions).  Whether  the  state  v_KO 
corresponds  to  an  unsafe  state  for  the  AHS  or  not, 
depends  on  the  state  of  the  adjacent  vehicles  (this  is 
discussed in section 2.1.3).  
Figure 2: failure modes, maneuvers, safety impact   
2.1.2.  Multiple  vehicles  failures:  When  nearly 
simultaneous  failures  affect  multiple  vehicles,  in 
particular  adjacent  vehicles,  in  the  same  platoon  or  in 
neighboring  platoons,  the  maneuver  with  the  highest 
priority is applied. The success of a maneuver depends 
on  many  factors,  for  example,  the  state  of  faulty 
vehicles  in  the  platoon,  the  capability  of  the  adjacent 
vehicles  needed  to  assist  the  faulty  vehicle  to  realize 
the  maneuver  (particularly  the  leaders  concerned  by 
the maneuver), and the traffic flow. 
As  an  example,  let  us  assume  that  a  vehicle  v1  is 
faulty and has to perform the TIE maneuver. If another 
vehicle is already performing a maneuver with a higher 
priority, the maneuver requested by v1 will be refused. 
Hence,  v1  will  ask  for  another  maneuver  of  a  higher 
priority  until  the  requested  maneuver  is  accepted. 
Similarly,  when  a  maneuver  fails,  the  system  evolves 
towards  a  more  degraded  failure  mode  and  one  of  its 
associated  maneuvers  must  be  attempted  to  put  the 
system in a safe state.   
2.1.3.  Impact  of  failures  on  the  AHS  safety:  The 
scenarios  described  in  Figure  2  concern  a  single 
vehicle.  Catastrophic  situations  leading  the  system  to 
an unsafe state require the occurrence of simultaneous 
failures affecting multiple adjacent vehicles in a small 
neighborhood in space and in time. 
Based  on  the  analysis  presented  in  [15],  we 
summarize in Table 2 three catastrophic situations that 
would  lead  the  AHS  to  an  unsafe  state,  taking  into 
account  the  number  of  failures  affecting  different 
adjacent vehicles and their severity.

applications 
coordination 
between the vehicles in the platoon (intra-platoon) and 
with neighboring platoons (inter-platoon). A vehicle is 
involved in the coordination process when i) it creates 
a platoon, ii) enters an existing platoon, or iii) when it 
leaves  a  platoon  to  switch  to  manual  driving.  Various 
communication models (centralized and decentralized) 
have  been  proposed  in  [17]  for  the  inter-  and  intra-
platoon coordination, based on the PATH architecture. 
They are briefly summarized hereafter.  
2.2.1.  Inter-platoon  coordination:  Communications 
between  platoons  can  be  achieved  only  through  the 
leaders,  and  the  coordination  can  be  centralized  or 
decentralized.  
In 
the 
the  centralized  coordination  model 
the 
coordination  between 
leaders  of  neighboring 
platoons  is  performed  through  a  centralized  Service 
Access  Point  (SAP)  that  is  on  the  road-side.  The 
coordination  between  different  maneuvers  is  achieved 
at  the  level  of  the  SAP.  Figure  3  presents  an  example 
considering  an  AHS  composed  of  two  lanes  with  two 
platoons,  p1  followed  by  p2  on  lane2,  and  two  free-
agents,  v7  and  v8,  on  lane1.  Let  us  assume  that  i)  v7 
and v8, which just entered the highway, decide to join 
respectively platoons p2 and p1, and ii) simultaneously 
and  independently,  vehicles  v2  and  v5,  belonging 
respectively  to  platoons  p1  and  p2,  are  coordinating 
maneuvers  to  exit  the  AHS  after  passing  through 
lane1.  The  SAP  determines  the  priorities  between  the 
maneuvers  involving  the  four  concerned  vehicles  and 
communicates  its  decision  to  the  leaders  of  the 
platoons 
the  concerned  vehicles.  The 
decision would be  to assign the highest priority to the 
maneuvers  requested  by  v7  and  v8,  because  it  is 
important  to  release  lane1  as  quickly  as  possible,  so 
that v2 and v5 can leave the highway.  
including 
Figure 3: Centralized inter-platoon coordination   
In 
the 
case  of  decentralized 
inter-platoon 
coordination, the decision is made by the leaders of the 
concerned  platoons.  The  information  related  to  the 
state of all vehicles is stored in an onboard system that 
contains a knowledge base of the neighborhood traffic. 
This  coordination  strategy  has  an  impact  on  the 
implementation of some atomic maneuvers. Compared 
to the centralized strategy, it involves fewer vehicles in 
the  accomplishment  of  some  maneuver.  Let  us 
consider as an example the case of a faulty vehicle that 
needs  to  perform  a  Take  Immediate  Exit-Escorted 
(TIE-E)  maneuver  with  the  support  of  a  neighboring 
platoon. If the inter-platoon coordination is centralized, 
the  implementation  of  this  maneuver  involves:  1)  all 
the vehicles in front of the faulty vehicle (including the 
leader) and the vehicle just behind it, and 2) the leader 
the  neighboring  platoon.  However, 
of 
the 
decentralized  inter-platoon  coordination  strategy,  only 
the leaders of the two platoons and the vehicles just in 
front  and  behind  the  faulty  vehicle  contribute  to  the 
maneuver. More details are provided in [2] [16].  
in 
2.2.2. Intra-platoon coordination:  
In  the  centralized  intra-platoon  coordination  model 
the coordination of operation and maneuvers involving 
the vehicles of a platoon is centered on one vehicle: the 
leader.  For  example,  during  a  split  maneuver  that  is 
initiated to allow the safe exit of a faulty vehicle, three 
vehicles  are  involved:  the  leader,  the  splitter,  and  the 
vehicle  following  the  splitter  (if  it  exists).  The  faulty 
vehicle  should  announce  the  need  to  initiate  this 
maneuver  to  its  platoon s  leader.  The  leader  then 
calculates the distance and the speed to be respected by 
the  vehicles  that  are  involved  in  the  maneuver,  and 
orders 
them 
the 
accordingly. 
involved  vehicles 
to  change 
In the  case  where  the  intra-platoon  coordination is 
decentralized, each platoon member has knowledge of 
the  platoon formation and can react independently, by 
communicating directly with other vehicles. The leader 
is informed of changes as it is the representative of the 
platoon for inter-platoon coordination.  
2.2.3.  Coordination  strategies:  In  our  work  we  have 
considered  the  four  strategies  resulting  from  the 
combination of the above models, given in Table 3.

3. Safety modeling   
We  consider  a  two  lane  AHS  with  one  platoon  in 
each  lane.  Vehicles  in  each  platoon  can  change  from 
one  platoon  to  the  other  one  freely.  Each  platoon 
contains  up  to  n  vehicles.  We  model  this  system, 
taking  into  account  the  six  failure  modes  and  the 
the 
associated  maneuvers  presented 
catastrophic  situations  of  Table  2  and  the  four 
coordination strategies of Table 3.  
in  Table  1, 
The  measure  evaluated  corresponds 
the 
probability  that  the  modeled  AHS  is  in  one  of  the 
catastrophic  situations  described  in  Table  2,  as  a 
to 
function  of  time  (t).  This  measure  is  referred  to  as 
system unsafety, and is denoted by
. 
)(tS
As discussed in Section 2, several factors need to be 
considered  when  analyzing  the  impact  of  failures  on 
the  safety  of  an  AHS.  In  particular,  the  success  or 
failure of a recovery maneuver depends on the state of 
the  adjacent  vehicles  contributing  to  the  maneuver. 
Thus, 
the  models  should  also  describe  some 
characteristics  of  the  configuration  of  the  platoons  as 
well as their dynamic evolution. 
taking 
into  account 
Modeling  techniques  based  on  Stochastic  Activity 
Networks (SAN) are well suited to evaluate the system 
unsafety 
the  considerations 
mentioned  above.  This  formalism  and  the  associated 
Möbius tool [12] provide compositional operators that 
are useful to master the complexity of the models, both 
at model construction and model processing phases. In 
particular,  the  system  model  can  be  built  by  the 
composition of atomic models using Join and Replicate 
operators.  
3.2.1.  One_vehicle:  The  SAN  submodel  shown  in 
Figure  5  describing  the  vehicle  behavior  models  the 
failure modes of the vehicle and associated maneuvers, 
presented  in  Table  1.  The  model  consists  of  six 
interconnected  elementary  SANs.  Each  elementary 
SAN  models  the  occurrence  of  a  failure  mode  for  a 
given  class  of  severity  and  the  associated  maneuver.
