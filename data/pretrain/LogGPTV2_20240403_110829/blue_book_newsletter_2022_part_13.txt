### [vdirsyncer](vdirsyncer.md)
* New: Introduce vdirsyncer.
    [vdirsyncer](https://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/) is a Python
    command-line tool for synchronizing calendars and addressbooks between a variety
    of servers and the local filesystem. The most popular usecase is to synchronize
    a server with a local folder and use a set of other programs such as
    [`khal`](khal.md) to change the local events and contacts. Vdirsyncer can then
    synchronize those changes back to the server.
    However, `vdirsyncer` is not limited to synchronizing between clients and
    servers. It can also be used to synchronize calendars and/or addressbooks
    between two servers directly.
    It aims to be for calendars and contacts what OfflineIMAP is for emails.

    institutions.
## Android
### [Android Tips](android_tips.md)
* New: [Extend the life of your battery.](android_tips.md#extend-the-life-of-your-battery)
    [Research](https://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210224725-Charging-research-and-methodology)
    has shown that keeping your battery charged between 0% and 80% can make your
    battery's lifespan last 2x longer than when you use a full battery cycle from
    0-100%.
    As a non root user you can
    [install Accubattery](https://www.getdroidtips.com/custom-battery-charge-limit-android/)
    (not in F-droid :( ) to get an alarm when the battery reaches 80% so that you
    can manually unplug it. Instead of leaving the mobile charge in the night and
    stay connected at 100% a lot of hours until you unplug, charge it throughout the
    day.
### [GrapheneOS](grapheneos.md)
* New: Introduce GrapheneOS.
    [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is a private and secure mobile operating
    system with Android app compatibility. Developed as a non-profit open source
    project.
* New: Introduce GrapheneOS.
    GrapheneOS is a private and secure mobile operating system with great
    functionality and usability. It starts from the strong baseline of the Android
    Open Source Project (AOSP) and takes great care to avoid increasing attack
    surface or hurting the strong security model. GrapheneOS makes substantial
    improvements to both privacy and security through many carefully designed
    features built to function against real adversaries. The project cares a lot
    about usability and app compatibility so those are taken into account for all of
    our features.
* New: [Installation.](grapheneos.md#installation)
    I was not able to follow the [web](https://grapheneos.org/install/web)
    instructions so I had to follow the [cli](https://grapheneos.org/install/cli)
    ones.
    Whenever I run a `fastboot` command it got stuck in ``,
    so I added the next rules on the `udev` configuration at
    `/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules`
    ```
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="18d1", ATTR{idProduct}=="4ee7", MODE="0600", OWNER="myuser"
    ```
    The `idProduct` and `idVendor` were deduced from `lsusb`. Then after a restart
    everything worked fine.
# Arts
## Writing
### [Forking this garden](forking_this_wiki.md)
* Correction: Update forking instructions.
    I recommend against forking the repository via Github. If you do that, you'll have all the history of my repository, which will make your repository more heavy than it should (as I have a lot of images), and it will make it hard for me to make pull requests to your digital garden.
    Furthermore, you'll always see a message in your repo similar to `This branch is 909 commits ahead, 1030 commits behind lyz-code:master. ` like you can see in [this fork](https://github.com/m0wer/memento). Also if you don't want to keep all the content I've made so far and want to start from scratch then the only thing that is useful for you is the skeleton I've made, and I don't need any attribution or credit for that :P.
    If on the other hand you do want to keep all my content, then wouldn't it be better to just make contributions to this repository instead?
    Therefore the best way to give credit and attribution is by building your garden (the more we are writing the merrier :) ), and then if you want to spread the word that my garden exists within your content then that would be awesome.
    If you end up building your own, remember to add yourself to the [digital
    garden's list](https://github.com/lyz-code/best-of-digital-gardens).

## [Aerial Silk](aerial_silk.md)
* New: Introduce Aerial Silk, some warmups and some figures.
    [Aerial Silk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_silk) is a type of performance in which one or more artists perform aerial acrobatics while hanging from a fabric. The fabric may be hung as two pieces, or a single piece, folded to make a loop, classified as hammock silks. Performers climb the suspended fabric without the use of safety lines and rely only on their training and skill to ensure safety. They use the fabric to wrap, suspend, drop, swing, and spiral their bodies into and out of various positions. Aerial silks may be used to fly through the air, striking poses and figures while flying. Some performers use dried or spray rosin on their hands and feet to increase the friction and grip on the fabric.

    nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or
    "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides
    a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single
    solution.

* New: Introduce the Alder tree.
    ![ ](Alder-3.jpg)
    Alders are trees comprising the genus Alnus in the birch family Betulaceae (like
    the [birch](#birch)). The genus parts are "al" which means "close by" and "lan"
    which means "side of the river", so they are trees that grow close to rivers or
    creeks.
* Correction: Give more details of the beech tree.
    ![ ](beech-4.jpg)
    The leaves of beech trees are elliptic, a little pointy at the end, flat, and
    with a short petiole. They are big and wide leaves ranging from 4-9 cm long.
    Very abundant, they have a light green colour with a darker tone and glossy on
    the upper side.
    The fruit is a small, sharply three-angled nut 10-15 mm long, borne singly or in
    pairs in soft-spined husks 1.5-2.5 cm long, known as cupules. The husk can have
    a variety of spine- to scale-like appendages, the character of which is, in
    addition to leaf shape, one of the primary ways beeches are differentiated. The
    nuts are edible, though bitter (though not nearly as bitter as acorns) with a
    high tannin content, and are called beechnuts or beechmast.
    They are big trees easily going between 30 and 45 meters. It looks very
    different if its isolated or being part of a forest. The first one the branches
    grow from the middle of the trunk and are horizontal, in the second, the
    branches go up and start over the half of the trunk. The principal root is very
    powerful, with very strong secondary roots, developing lateral superficial
    roots.
    ![ ](beech-bark.jpg)
    The trunk is right with a grayish-cinder bark, smooth until it's old, usually
    covered by moss an lichen. Smaller branches are zigzagging with reddish-brown
    pointy buds.
    The canopy is big, dense, rounded and semi spheric, giving a lot of shadow.
    It grows slow in the first years, being the most active between the tenth and
    twelve year, reaching it's maximum height when it's twenty five, although it
    lives around three hundred years.
* Correction: Give more details of the birch tree.
    The simple leaves are rhomboidal, between 3 and 6 cm, singly or doubly serrate
    except at the base, feather-veined, petiolate and stipulate. Although they are
    alternate, many leaves spawn from each side of the branch, making some think
    that they are not alternate. They often appear in pairs, but these pairs are
    really borne on spur-like, two-leaved, lateral branchlets.
    The canopy is rounded and irregular giving few shadow.
    The fruit is a small samara, although the wings may be obscure in some species.
    They differ from the alders in that the female catkins are not woody and
    disintegrate at maturity, falling apart to release the seeds, unlike the woody,
    cone-like female alder catkins.
    The bark of all birches is characteristically smooth and white, although in
    older ones the lower part is usually cracked and takes blackish brown colours.
    It's marked with long, horizontal lenticels, and often separates into thin,
    papery plates, especially upon the paper birch.
* New: How to tell apart the different trees.
