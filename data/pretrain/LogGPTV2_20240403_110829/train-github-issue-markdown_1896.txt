Calling pandas.io.sql.read_frame can results in data frame with duplicate
column names. For example when SQL query contains joins on tables with
duplicate columns.
Data frames with duplicate column names cause errors in many pandas functions.
I can't even rename columns as df.columns = new_columns generates errors.
I think correct behavior would be for pandas.io.sql.read_frame have an option
to "deduplicate" column names (for example by adding a number) or generate an
error with duplicate column names.
