User: What are the possible causes of a TLS handshake failure? Please explain in detail.
Assistant: There are many reasons for TLS connection failure, mainly including the following aspects: 1. An encrypted connection cannot be established. It may be due to the use of an invalid certificate or the certificate has expired, or the certificate root certificate is not trusted, or the correct protocol version is not used, etc. 2. The server is not properly configured. Improper server configuration can cause TLS connections to fail. For example, the server only supports old encryption algorithms such as DES and RC4, but does not support more modern encryption algorithms. At this time, the handshake between the client and the server will fail. 3. Client or server network problems. Connection failures often occur in the network, such as connection timeouts or network delays, which usually lead to handshake failures. In addition, network failures may also cause connection failures. 4. The TLS version is incompatible. The handshake can also fail if the client and server are using different versions of the TLS protocol. 5. The security protocol assertion failed. During the handshake, the server sends a protocol assertion indicating which cipher suites and encryption key lengths it is able to accept. If the client does not have the appropriate cipher suite or length, the handshake will fail. 6. Misconfiguration: Sometimes entering the wrong password or the path of the certificate library file during configuration will also cause the TLS handshake to fail. In short, there are many reasons for the failure of the TLS handshake. It is necessary to comprehensively check and analyze multiple aspects. After eliminating each possible cause, an effective solution can be provided for the establishment of the TLS connection.
