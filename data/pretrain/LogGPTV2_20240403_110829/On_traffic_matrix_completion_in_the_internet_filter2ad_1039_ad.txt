### A Number of Drawbacks

First, while the previous analyses provide some insight into the optimal conditions for an Autonomous System (AS) to perform Traffic Matrix (TM) completion, it remains unclear where in the Internet these conditions are most prevalent. Second, the analyses rely on highly idealized network models that significantly differ from the actual AS topology. For instance, the analyses assume a single source and destination per node, and that routing is both shortest-path and symmetric. These assumptions do not hold in the real-world AS-level Internet.

### Evaluation of TM Completion in Real ASes

In this section, we evaluate the ability of real ASes to perform TM completion. Our objectives are twofold:
1. To verify that the positive results from Section 3 hold in practice—specifically, that TM completion is possible, at least for certain rank matrices, in the real Internet.
2. To answer a set of natural follow-on questions:
   - Where in the Internet (e.g., among top-tier ISPs or lower in the AS hierarchy) is the opportunity for TM completion greatest?
   - What factors, as suggested by the previous analyses, are actually most significant in influencing TM completion in the Internet?

### 4.1 Data

To address these questions, we analyze a large dataset of AS paths in use in the Internet. The data consists of a snapshot of all active BGP paths used by 376 ASes (monitors) taken at midnight UTC on August 6th, 2010. This dataset includes over 100 million AS paths and 524,761 unique prefixes. Note that not all BGP tables show paths to all prefixes. Since these paths are the active ones at the time of collection, each path represents the sequence of ASes that traffic will flow through from the monitor to the destination prefix.

Next, we select a subset of monitors and prefixes such that, for every monitor and every prefix, our dataset contains the AS path from the monitor to the prefix. This results in 133 monitors and 225,041 prefixes.

With the path from every monitor to every destination, we can construct visibility matrices for each of the 28,763 ASes in the dataset. These visibility matrices have a size of 133 × 225,041, and for each entry, we can determine whether its value is 0 or 1 by checking if the observer AS appears on the corresponding AS path. Thus, our input for the analyses below consists of over 28,000 visibility matrices, each containing about 30 million elements with high confidence.

These visibility matrices represent only a portion of the complete visibility matrix of each AS, so our analyses in this section focus on each AS's attempt to apply matrix completion to a portion of its TM.

In some of our results, we utilize AS relationships (customer/provider and peer/peer). For this purpose, we use the AS relationship labeling performed and published by CAIDA [11], which is based on the most comprehensive methodology available.

### 4.2 Metrics

We characterize an observer AS using both standard metrics from complex network studies and networking-specific metrics. To measure the "centrality" of an observer AS, we use its k-core decomposition shell (or "k-shell") [1]. The k-core decomposition identifies nested shells of a graph that are successively more densely interconnected. Since node degree is significant, we also measure each observer’s degree (the number of adjacent ASs along a BGP path). Additionally, we consider networking-specific metrics: the number of customers and the number of peers of the observer.

The TM completion ability of each observer depends on the rank \( k \) at which TM completion is attempted, with higher ranks indicating more accurate completion. In most cases, observers cannot complete their entire TMs. However, AICMC (a specific method) identifies the subset of elements that can be recovered for any given rank. Instead of asking "at what rank \( k \) can the entire TM be recovered?" as in Section 3, we use a different metric called "expected rank." Expected rank is defined as the expected value of the maximum rank at which a randomly chosen entry can be recovered. We compute this metric by averaging the maximum rank at which each non-visible entry can be recovered (using zero when the element cannot be recovered at any rank).

Note that the matrices used in this section are not structured the same way as those in Section 3. For example, they are not symmetric and are indexed differently. Therefore, rank values cannot be directly compared. Our focus is on how effective rank varies rather than its specific value.

### 4.3 Results

We first examine whether centrality in the Internet, as measured by k-shell, is a good predictor of TM completion ability. For this, we look at the top 500 ASes in terms of k-shell number. Figure 9(a) shows a scatterplot of k-shell versus expected rank, and Figure 9(b) shows expected rank for ASes in order of decreasing k-shell number. Values in these figures have been smoothed to reduce noise.

The figures indicate that centrality, as measured by k-shell, has some relationship to completion ability, but the relationship is not strong. Among ASes in the innermost shell (the nucleus), many have low completion ability. In fact, on average, ASes in the core have lower completion ability than those just outside the nucleus.

### Conclusion

Our analysis reveals that while centrality (as measured by k-shell) and degree have some impact on TM completion ability, the relationship is not strong. Other factors, such as the number of customers and peers, may play a more significant role. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the factors that influence TM completion in the real Internet.
