Symfony version | 3.3.10  
After upgrading from 3.2 to 3.3. Files collection is now just empty in
controller when updating entity without selecting new files. So it just
removes the file entities. It used to work before 3.3 now it fails.  
Maybe I missed something and it's planned changes in form file type behavior?
Here is a demo which shows the issue https://github.com/skornev/vichbundle-
