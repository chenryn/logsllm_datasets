User: I am writing a python script to copy python(say ABC.py) files from one directory to another 
directory with the same folder name(say ABC) as script name excluding .py.
In the local system it works fine and copying the files from one directory to others by
creating the same name folder.
But actually I want copy these files from my local system (windows XP) to the remote
system(Linux) located in other country on which I execute my script. But I am getting
the error as "Destination Path not found" means I am not able to connect to remote
that's why.
I use SSH Secure client.
I use an IP Address and Port number to connect to the remote server.
Then it asks for user id and password.
But I am not able to connect to the remote server by my python script.

Can Any one help me out how can I do this??
Assistant: I used the same script, but my host failed to respond. My host is in different network.
WinError 10060] A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond
