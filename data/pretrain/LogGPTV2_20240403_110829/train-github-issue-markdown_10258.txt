### Describe the workflow you want to enable
Doing FeatureSelection droping correlated features is standard ml proc that
sklearn covers.  
But, as i interpret the documentation, sklearn treats the featureSelection
based on correlations as a previous step, outside the pipeline.  
An in the pipeline, you can only do univarte or iterative featureSelections
docs
I would like to do FeatureSelection based on correlations, as a pipeline step
### Describe your proposed solution
something like
    from sklearn.covariance import MinCovDet_
    clf = Pipeline([
      ('feature_selection', SelectFromModel(MinCovDet_())),
      ('classification', RandomForestClassifier())
    ])
    clf.fit(X, y)
Where MinCovDet_ ~ MinCovDet but returns the ingested df, so the
classification step can do the fit
### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
Maybe a `SelectFromCorrelation` wrapper that you can run on top of all the
`sklearn.covariance` correlators would be better
