dividing these two datasets into the reused passwords
group (i.e., the joint accounts) and the not-reused pass-
words group, they ﬁnd that “the proportions of various
compositions are similar between the reused passwords
and the 7k7k’s not-reused passwords, but different from
Tianya’s not-reused passwords”. However, they did not
explain what the “various compositions” are. Their ex-
planation also does not answer the critical question: why
are there so many 7k7k users using “111222tianya”
as their passwords? We posit they had removed 3.91*2
million joint accounts from 7k7k but the not 3.91 million
ones from Tianya In addition, they did not observe the
extremely abnormal fact that all the passwords in 7k7k
occur even times. Such contaminated data would lead to
inaccurate results. For example, Li et al. [34] reported
that there are 32.41% of passwords in 7k7k containing
dates in “YYYMMDD”, yet the actual value is 6 times
lower: 5.42%.
We have reported this issue to the authors of [34],
they responded to us and acknowledged this ﬂaw in their
journal version [26]. Unfortunately, Han et al. [26] do
not clean the datasets in the journal version in the manner
that we outlined.
B Detailed information about our 22 se-
mantic dictionaries
In order to make our work as reproducible as possible
and to facilitate the community, we now detail how
to construct our 22 semantic-based dictionaries. All
dictionaries are built with natural lengths. The length≥5
requirement in the upper-part of Table 5 is set conser-
vatively for ensuring accuracy only when we perform
matching. Actually, we also performed measurements
for length≥3 and length≥4, and got higher ﬁgures (per-
centages) but less accuracy. Thus, we omit them.
The ﬁrst dictionary “English word lower” is from
http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html
and it contains about 58,000 popular lower-case English
words. “English lastname” is a dictionary consisting of
18,839 last names with over 0.001% frequency in the
US population during the 1990 census, according to the
US Census Bureau [11]. “English ﬁrstname” contains
5,494 most common ﬁrst names (including 1,219 male
and 4,275 female names) in US [11]. The dictionary
“English fullname” is a cartesian product of “English
ﬁrstname” and “English lastname”, consisting of 1.04
million most common English full names.
To get a Chinese full name dictionary, we employ
the 20 million hotel reservations dataset [23] leaked
in Dec. 2013. The Chinese family name dictionary
includes 504 family names which are ofﬁcially recog-
nized in China. Since the ﬁrst names of Chinese users
are widely distributed and can be almost any combi-
nations of Chinese words, we do not consider them
in this work. As the names are originally in Chi-
nese, we transfer them into Pinyin without tones by
using a Python procedure from https://pypinyin.
readthedocs.org/en/latest/ and remove the dupli-
cates. We call these two dictionaries “Pinyin fullname”
and “Pinyin familyname”, respectively.
“Pinyin word lower” is a Chinese word dictionary
known as “SogouLabDic.dic”, and “Pinyin place” is a
Chinese place dictionary. Both of them are from [45]

and also originally in Chinese. We translate them into
Pinyin in the same way as we tackle the name dictionar-
ies. “Mobile number” consists of all potential Chinese
mobile numbers, which are 11-digit strings with the
ﬁrst seven digits conforming to pre-deﬁned values and
the last four digits being random. Since it is almost
impossible to build such a dictionary on ourselves, we
instead write a Python script and automatically test each
11-digit string against the mobile-number search engine
