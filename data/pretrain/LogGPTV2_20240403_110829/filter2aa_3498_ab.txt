network—where 
real-time 
surveillance, communications, and flight information is processed to separate 
aircraft—because of network connections, as shown in Figure 1.

a This infrastructure consists primarily of the backbone FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) and 
several local area networks; FAA relies on this infrastructure to conduct ATC operations.  ATC systems 
are hosted on local area networks at ATC facilities, which have connections to both FTI operational and 
mission-support networks.  (Source:  OIG) 
7  In recent years, huge amounts of U.S. Government (including Department of Transportation) and 
commercial data were “exfiltrated” to foreign domains on the Internet.  This has resulted in a sweeping 
effort to strengthen Government-wide cyber security by the Office of Management and Budget.

Because of network connections—authorized (such as performing system 
maintenance) and unauthorized (such as inadequate network setup)—between 
FAA’s mission-support and ATC systems, the risk of cyber attacks is magnified.  
These FAA security-related events of recent years highlight the risk of cyber 
attacks: 
 In FY 2006, we reported that FAA’s Remote Maintenance Monitoring 
System was connected to the less-secure mission-support network, which 
created security exposure to ATC operations; 
 In FY 2006, a viral attack originating from the Internet spread from 
administrative networks to ATC systems, forcing FAA to shut down a 
portion of its ATC systems in Alaska;  
 In FY 2008, hackers took over FAA computers in Alaska, becoming FAA 
“insiders.”  By taking advantage of FAA’s interconnected networks, hackers 
later stole FAA’s enterprise administrator’s password in Oklahoma, installed 
malicious codes with the stolen password, and compromised FAA’s domain 
controller in its Western Pacific Region.  At that point, hackers had the 
ability to obtain more than 40,000 FAA user IDs, passwords, and other 
information used to control a portion of the FAA mission-support network. 
 In FY 2009, hackers compromised an FAA public-facing Web application 
computer on the Internet and used it as a conduit to enter an FAA internal 
database server.  Included in the server was PII on 48,000 current and former 
FAA employees, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, 
pay grades/bands, addresses, veterans’ preferences, usernames and 
passwords, and education/medical/health information.   
These Web vulnerabilities occurred because (1) Web applications were not 
adequately configured to prevent unauthorized access and (2) Web application 
software with known vulnerabilities was not corrected in a timely manner by 
installing readily available security software patches released to the public by 
software vendors. 
Intrusion-detection Capabilities Are Not Adequate to Protect 
ATC Systems 
As previously shown in Figure 1, the ATC IP-based network infrastructure 
consists primarily of its backbone FTI wide-area network and numerous local area 
networks within ATC facilities.  While the FTI wide-area network is monitored by 
an FAA contractor, FAA relies on DOT’s Cyber Security Management Center 
9
(CSMC) to monitor cyber incidents at the facility level.  Adequate monitoring is 
critical for ensuring timely detection of network security incidents.  However, 
FAA’s intrusion-detection capability is ineffective because of inadequate 
deployment of IDS sensors and a lack of timely remediation of incidents detected.  
Specifically,  
 Cyber incidents were not effectively monitored at ATC facilities.  To 
identify potential cyber incidents, FAA needs IDS sensors installed at key 
locations to collect critical information for security analyses.  ATC systems 
are located at hundreds of operational facilities such as en route centers, 
terminal radar approach control facilities, airport control towers, and flight 
service stations.  However, IDS sensors have been deployed to only 11 of 
these ATC facilities—five en route centers, four terminal radar approach 
control facilities or airport traffic control towers, and the Technical Center in 
Atlantic City and Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City 
(see Table 2).

Further, these IDS sensors provide monitoring coverage only for mission-
support systems at these facilities, not for ATC operational systems.  As a 
result, CSMC has little visibility into operations at ATC facilities, and 
cannot identify potential cyber attacks against ATC operational systems. 
10
According to CSMC and ATO management officials, effective IDS 
deployment requires close cooperation between CSMC and ATO.  However, 
this cooperation has been lacking.  Insufficient understanding of FAA 
network infrastructure was also a contributing factor, resulting in 
deployment of IDS sensors on an ad-hoc basis, which made CSMC 
monitoring of ATC systems less effective.  For example, FAA has not fully 
studied the connectivity of its network infrastructure (network mapping), 
including the locations of critical network points.   
 Cyber incidents were not remediated in a timely manner.  Once a cyber 
incident is detected, it must be examined and remediated quickly to 
minimize the security risk to the network.  During FY 2008, ATO received 
877 cyber-incident alerts from CSMC.  As of the end of FY 2008, 151 
incidents (17 percent) were still unresolved.  Fifty of these had been open for 
more than 3 months, including critical incidents in which hackers may have 
taken over control of ATO computers.   
According to both CSMC and ATO officials, the lack of needed 
information—such as IDS sensor data, critical data being collected on a 
network device in real-time (logging), and complete IP address 
information—was a major factor in being unable to pinpoint the actual 
network location when an incident occurred or the computer affected by the 
incident.  This lack of information has significantly impeded ATO’s ability 
to respond to cyber incidents.  For example, in March 2008, ATO officials 
directed CSMC to close over 60 unresolved cyber incidents identified in FYs 
2006 and 2007, stating that they were “nonactionable due to inability to 
perform further analysis because of time considerations.”   
The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 requires agencies to 
have procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents.  
Without effectively deploying IDS monitoring capability at ATC facilities, FAA 
cannot be fully aware of potential cyber attacks on ATC systems.  More seriously, 
the lack of timely remediation against cyber incidents left unsecured FAA 
computers on its networks.  As a result, FAA cannot take effective action to stop 
or prevent these cyber attacks, which increases the risk of further attacks on ATC 
systems.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
We recommend that the Acting Federal Aviation Administrator direct FAA’s 
Chief Information Officer and ATO’s Chief Operating Officer to: 
1. 
Ensure that all Web applications used in ATC systems are configured in 
compliance with Government security standards; 
2. 
Strengthen the patch management process by (a) identifying Web 
applications with known vulnerabilities, and (b) promptly installing relevant 
security patches in a timely manner;  
3. 
Take immediate action to correct high-risk vulnerabilities and establish a 
timetable for remediation of all remaining vulnerabilities identified during 
this audit;  
4. 
Resolve differences with CSMC and establish a timetable for deploying IDS 
monitoring devices covering local area networks at all ATC facilities; and 
5. 
In conjunction with CSMC officials, identify the information needed for 
remediation and establish procedures to ensure timely remediation of cyber 
incidents based on incident criticality as assessed by CSMC.   
AGENCY COMMENTS AND OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL 
RESPONSE 
We provided FAA with our draft report on March 3, 2009, and received its 
response on April 16, 2009.  FAA concurred with all of our recommendations, and 
said that it recognized that constant vigilance and effective action are the keys to 
addressing cyber security in its ATC systems.  FAA also pointed out that a critical 
element of its cyber security is the separation of the network infrastructure 
between the National Airspace System (NAS) for aircraft separation and FAA 
administrative/ATC mission-support systems.  We recognize the separation of 
FAA’s network infrastructure.  However, as stated in our report, cyber attacks can 
spread from the mission-support network to the NAS network because of system 
interconnections. 
FAA further stated that it recognized the importance of dealing with all system 
vulnerabilities and will treat vulnerabilities in this report with the utmost diligence.  
12
FAA’s response can be found in its entirety in Appendix A.  The responses to our 
recommendations are summarized as follows: 
Recommendation 1:  Concurred.  FAA stated that it is actively analyzing the 
identified vulnerabilities, and will develop new Plans of Action and Milestones 
(POA&Ms) based on the analysis.  The analysis was scheduled for completion by 
April 30, 2009.  FAA uses the DOT Secure Web Application Standards as the 
basis for securely configuring Web applications, and will ensure that the Web 
applications identified in our report are in compliance with these standards.  New 
system POA&M items will be developed by July 31, 2009.   
Recommendation 2:  Concurred.  FAA stated that security patching 
vulnerabilities identified in our report will be addressed via the ATO Certification 
and Accreditation Remediation Management process.  The ATO audit/compliance 
team will audit the existence of appropriate security patches.  Patch 
implementation will be performed in accordance with established FAA 
configuration management processes.  These corrective actions will be included in 
system POA&Ms by July 31, 2009.  
Recommendation 3:  Concurred.  FAA will ensure that the high-rated 
vulnerabilities correlated to FAA systems are handled with high priority for 
immediate implementation.  Implementation will be tracked via the POA&M 
process.  FAA is now reviewing detailed data from our testing to assess the 
criticality of the vulnerabilities identified.  The review was scheduled for 
completion by April 30, 2009.  Based on the findings, FAA will develop a 
timetable for remediation by July 31, 2009.  However, FAA agreed to take 
immediate action to fix critical vulnerabilities.  In follow-up meetings, FAA 
committed to sharing its April evaluation results and action plan on fixing critical 
vulnerabilities with us in May 2009.  
Recommendation 4:  Concurred.  While FAA believes that its relationship with 
CSMC is essentially sound, within 30 days the FAA CIO—along with the CIO for 
ATO—will meet with CSMC leadership to discuss strengths and weaknesses of 
interactions between their organizations and identify any areas in need of 
improvement.  
As an additional level of protection, internal NAS facility IP demarcation points 
between NAS entities and mission-support entities have been identified by FAA as 
requiring additional IDS sensors to be installed.  FAA plans to implement IDS 
capability at the facilities housing one of the NAS systems (ARTS IIIE) in 
13
February 2010.  A deployment strategy for the remaining automation systems will 
be developed in December 2009.  
Recommendation 5:  Concurred.  ATO has recently implemented two process 
improvements: a Reconciliation of Findings process and an Open Incident 
Handling process, thereby reducing the number of open incidents.  In conjunction 
with CSMC, ATO has taken steps to improve timely response of cyber incidents.  
Specifically, CSMC and ATO are working together through focused meetings and 
cyber security-related workshops to refine the process of identifying the criticality 
of incidents for remediation.  A refined process will be developed in August 2009. 
ACTIONS REQUIRED 
FAA’s actions taken and planned are responsive to our recommendations and are 
considered resolved.  These actions are also subject to follow-up provisions in 
Department of Transportation Order 8000.1C.

EXHIBIT A.  SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY 
This audit was conducted by KPMG of Washington, D.C., under contract to DOT 
OIG, and by OIG staff.  The audit was conducted at FAA Headquarters, CSMC, 
selected FAA facilities and at the FTI operational center in Melbourne, Florida.   
OIG staff performed an Internet search and reviewed the ATO Risk Assessment 
Process Site Survey Plan.  The search and review generated two lists of Web 
applications used to support ATC operations.  The lists served as a basis for 
KPMG’s conducting the external and internal vulnerability assessment/penetration 
tests.  OIG staff also conducted an analysis of significant cyber incidents identified
