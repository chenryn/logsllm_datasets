When I set `Wn=2`, I correctly received the error message:
```
ValueError: Digital filter critical frequencies must be 0 < Wn < 1
```
However, `Wn=1` is accepted without any error. To ensure consistency and clarity, the error message should be updated to:
```
ValueError: Digital filter critical frequencies must be 0 < Wn <= 1
```
if `Wn=1` is indeed a valid value.
