### Analysis of TrueCrypt Build Environment and Differences

#### 3.3.2 Driver Analysis

After setting up the build environment, several differences remain between the 32-bit and 64-bit drivers.

In the 32-bit driver, a difference at file offset `0x00000270` corresponds to the time/date-stamp in the PE headers. Similar timestamp differences are observed at offsets `0x0001EA44` and `0x00034184`. Specifically, the timestamp at `0x0001EA44` matches the location in the debug directory structure, which contains the address of the debug section. The debug section is located at file offset `0x0002CBA8` in the 32-bit driver and at `0x0002F490` in the 64-bit driver, where another difference is found (see the next paragraph). The timestamp at `0x00034184` matches the location in the export directory table.

File offset `0x000002C0` represents the optional PE checksum header, which differs due to slight variations in the file content leading to a different checksum. File offset `0x00000300` indicates the certificate table difference, which is expected as explained earlier. The end of the original file contains the certificate.

In the PDB debug section, pointed to by the debug directory, a 16-byte difference starting at `0x0002CBAC` is observed. This section's format is undocumented but described in [19] as containing a signature ("RSDS"), followed by a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) that is regenerated in each build. The GUID is used by the debugger to link a binary file to its PDB debug file. Our 16-byte difference matches the location of the GUID. Next to it is an "age" field followed by the path of the debug file, which led to a difference we resolved by using the same project path as in the official build. Since the project was compiled in release configuration (not debug), this information should not be present, making its presence unclear.

#### NASM Version Issues

In versions 6.3 and 6.3a, the readme file suggests using NASM "version 2.06 or compatible." However, using version 2.06 during the build process causes NASM to crash when assembling the 64-bit driver. A ticket on the NASM bug tracking system [40] mentions this specific issue, which was resolved in version 2.08-rc1, released one week before TrueCrypt v6.3. This bug ticket can be correlated with the internal development of TrueCrypt.

#### 64-bit Driver Analysis

The 64-bit version of the driver, `truecrypt-x64.sys`, shows similar patterns. In versions 6.2 and 6.2a, an additional difference spanning 5 consecutive bytes at file offset `0x0001CFCB` is observed. Unlike other differences, this one affects the `.text` section, which contains the logic of the driver. Our build reads `0F 1F 44 00 00`, while the official build reads `66 66 90 66 90`.

Disassembled, these sequences are:
- `66 66 90 66 90`: 
  - `data32 xchg ax,ax`
  - `xchg ax,ax`
- `0F 1F 44 00 00`: 
  - `DWORD PTR [rax+rax*1+0x0]`

Functionally, both sequences realize No Operation (NOP). These NOPs serve for code alignment. Intel's documentation [23] lists various NOP sequences, and our NOP corresponds to a 5-byte NOP. However, the official build's NOP sequence is not listed in Intel's table. AMD's documentation [1] recommends `66 66 90 66 90` for a 5-byte NOP. This suggests the compiler adapts its output based on the processor type. Compiling on an AMD processor confirms this hypothesis, showing the 5-byte NOP as in the official build. Thus, the developers likely used an AMD processor for versions 6.2 and 6.2a.

#### 3.3.3 TrueCrypt Installer

After analyzing the remaining files and explaining the differences, we can package the original files with our compiled installer. The resulting installer is 3,458,614 bytes, close to the original size (3,466,248 bytes). The usual time/date-stamp, checksum, and certificate table differ, and the original installer has a certificate at the end of the file.

A new difference occurs at `0x0034C632` on 4 bytes, which appears to be a checksum. Investigating TrueCryptâ€™s source code, we find that it is indeed a checksum. During packaging, the installer computes an integrity checksum over its complete version. Before signing, the installer replaces bytes between offsets `0x00000130` and `0x000001FF` with zeros to zero out the Certificate Table. This range includes the optional PE header and data directories, weakening the integrity check. The installer also truncates the file after the magic word "TCINSCRC," effectively deleting the digital signature. The CRC32 computed over this modified file corresponds to the checksum in question.

Version 5.1a was released twice, with the second edition released the same day as version 6.0. This second edition repackages the original files with a new installer derived from version 6.0. Comparing this new installer with the v6.0 installer shows significant differences, including changes in addresses, code alignment, and eight completely different resources. Reverse-engineering or recreating the source based on the knowledge that it is an intermediate version between 5.1a and 6.0 is necessary. We concluded that this installer comes from v6.0 with changes to `VERSION STRING` and `VERSION NUM` constants to simulate version 5.1a. When using this new installer on a system-encrypted environment, the bootloader installed is from v6.0, renamed as v5.1a, causing differences in the resource section.

#### 3.4 Summary

This analysis shows that compiled versions 5.0 to 7.1a of TrueCrypt are directly compiled from the available source code, indicating no backdoors added by the developers. From a software engineering perspective, the study identifies sources of non-determinism, such as compiler and resource versions, alignment optimizations, and embedded timestamps. Debug information and unique identifiers also contribute to variations. Digital signatures are impossible to regenerate, so they should either be copied from the official build or reside in a separate file for comparison. Recompiling on different environments is necessary to identify all sources of non-determinism.

#### 4. Summary of Current Efforts

Other projects, such as Gitian and Debian, focus on deterministic builds. Gitian provides a virtual environment for Ubuntu, while Debian focuses on deterministic package builds. Fedora and OpenSUSE have also started their processes towards reproducible/verifiable builds, but their approaches are preliminary.

#### 5. Related Work

The Ubuntu Privacy Remix Team assessed TrueCrypt 7.0a for Linux in 2011, using a tool called `tcanalyzer` to verify the correctness of the official and custom builds. They found no mistakes or backdoors in the encryption or header format. They advise recompiling the source to prevent potential attacks.
