# Aura: A Peer-to-Peer Reputation System
## Overview
Aura, developed by Cat Okita in 2003, is a peer-to-peer reputation system designed to establish and manage trust within distributed networks. 

## What is a Reputation System?
Reputation systems are mechanisms that help users evaluate the credibility and reliability of other participants in a network. Examples include:
- Social networking platforms: LiveJournal, Friendster
- E-commerce: eBay
- Technical communities: Advogato, Slashcode

### Why Are Reputation Systems Important?
- **Establishing Trust:** Helps users determine the reliability of others.
- **Performance Metrics:** Measures the performance and behavior of participants.
- **Meme Propagation:** Facilitates the spread of ideas and information.
- **Spam Filtering:** Helps in identifying and filtering out spam.

## Challenges
- **Authentication:** Ensuring the identity of users.
- **Trust:** Building and maintaining trust among users.
- **Non-repudiation:** Preventing users from denying their actions.

## Design Considerations
- **Efficiency:** Fast and resource-efficient.
- **Security:** Difficult to corrupt information or impersonate others.
- **Portability:** Easy to use from any location.
- **Usability:** Simple to use and extend with plugins.
- **Decentralization:** Independent of centralized servers.

## Potential Attacks
- **Information Poisoning:** Manipulating data to mislead users.
- **Flooding:** Overloading the system with excessive data.
- **Trojans:** Malware that can compromise the system.
- **Identity Theft:** Stealing and using another user's identity.
- **Impersonation:** Pretending to be someone else.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting the system's availability.

## Implementation
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture:**
  - **Local Datastore:** Each node maintains its own data.
  - **Aggregator Functionality:** Nodes can also act as aggregators to collect and share data.
- **Reputation Metrics:**
  - **Overall Reputation:** General personal and general reputation.
  - **Specific Area Reputation:** Reputation in specific domains or areas.
- **Gossip Protocol:**
  - **Indirect Information:** Sharing information about entities not directly connected.

## Use Cases
- **Picking a Mailer:**
  - **Criteria:** Stability, speed, and security.
- **Evaluating a Mailing List Poster:**
  - **Credibility:** Determining if the poster is credible, an expert, or unknown.
- **Filtering:**
  - **Personal or Server Level:** Applying filters at different levels to manage incoming messages.

## Configuration
- **Text-Based Configuration:**
  - **Templates:** Use templates to describe the data format for exchanging details.
- **Cryptography:**
  - **Public/Private Key:** Requires the use of public/private key cryptography for secure communication.

## Future Plans
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Develop a more user-friendly interface.
- **Cross-Platform Portability:** Improve compatibility across different platforms.
- **Statistical Reporting:** Enhance the system's ability to generate detailed reports.
- **Group Keys:** Implement group keys for better management.
- **Trigger Automation:** Automate certain processes based on predefined triggers.
