User: I'm trying to develop a Twisted Web server but can't seem to run the twistd command. I've tried setting the python path and even included the path to the twistd.py script in my Path but nothing seems to work. 
I'm using Twisted 12.0.0 and Python 2.7 on Windows. Any help would be hugely appreciated.
Assistant: You need to set the %PATHEXT% environment variable to include .py, as well as %PATH% including the path to twistd.  Your most-recently-installed version of Python should then automatically launch it, assuming the filetype association was set correctly by the installer.
