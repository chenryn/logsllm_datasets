Question: In the context of iOS and iPadOS devices, why does the strength of a user's passcode or password directly impact the strength of encryption keys used for Data Protection? Select all that apply.
"A": "A stronger passcode provides more entropy for certain encryption keys, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks.",
"B": "The passcode is entangled with the deviceâ€™s UID, which increases the complexity of brute-force attempts.",
"C": "Stronger passcodes allow for quicker device unlocking, which enhances the encryption algorithm's performance.",
"D": "Using Face ID and Touch ID enables a user to establish a stronger passcode without affecting the user experience."
