I have an issue with SelectField having many menu items with "checked" prop
when first menu item have buttons as children. The list scrolls to first item
immediately when i click on last item or on items near last item.

The list should not scroll to first item when i check last or near last item.
It must stay at the same place where i clicked.
## Current Behavior
The list scrolls to first item immediately when i click on last item or on
items near last item.
