numbers are all dirty, we did not receive any calls on 2,784
phoneytokens during this period.
(a) Daily
(b) Hourly
Fig. 3. Diurnal Call Volume
Figure 3(a) shows the call volume on a daily basis. On an
average, Phoneypot received approximately 26K calls per day.
This is high considering the fact that these phone numbers
are not assigned to anyone and are indeed Phoneypot numbers
(phoneytokens). As we can also notice, weekday call volume
(≈33K) is much higher than weekend call volume (≈8K).
Moreover, we can observe from Figure 3(b) that majority of
the calls are being made during business hours. More calls
on weekdays and during business hours demonstrate that most
of the sources want to blend in with the normal telephony
trafﬁc to appear legitimate. It should be noted that the time
6
zone used was speciﬁc to the time zone of the phoneytoken.
For example, if the phone number’s area code is from New
York then the time zone used was UTC-4, and if it is from
California then UTC-7. We lack some data for 31st March
because of instability in our collection infrastructure.
B. Call distribution
(a) Outgoing call distribution for sources
can be seen, this graph is heavily tailed as well, which indicates
that there are many sources that are reaching out to many
phoneytokens. There are even sources that are making calls
to ≈10K phoneytokens. Both Figure 4(a) and 5, indicate that
there are sources that try to maximize their efforts by making
large number of calls to many phone numbers. This is a typical
pattern for telemarketers. On the other hand,
there exists
sources that are making lot of calls to very few phone numbers.
We observed that this typical pattern for debt collectors. Please
refer to Section VIII-B for more details. Alternatively in the
case of Telephony Denial of Service attacks, there are many
sources making huge number of calls to one destination in a
short period of time (see SectionVIII-A).
C. Age based characteristics
Phone numbers conform to a numbering plan and are al-
located to service providers in blocks in a coordinated fashion
(service providers make them available to their customers).
The North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is an integrated
telephone numbering plan that encompasses 25 countries and
territories primarily in North America, the Caribbean, and
U.S. territories. Thus, some blocks of numbers may be in
use for a long time while others could be very recent. Phone
numbers with old NPA-NXX introduction versions are more
likely to receive spam calls than other numbers. This is because
these numbers have already been publicized over the years at
different locations and would have been propagated widely.
(b) Incoming call distribution for phoneytokens
Fig. 4. Log-Log distributions of calls from sources and calls to phoneytokens
In Figure 4(a) and
4(b), we show the outgoing call
(calls from sources) and incoming call (calls to phoneytokens)
distributions to Phoneypot respectively on a log-log scale. As
we can observe, both are heavily tailed, indicating that there
are certain sources/destinations which are making/receiving
signiﬁcantly higher number of calls than others. This is very
similar to power law distribution seen on the web [32].
Fig. 5. Log-log outdegree distribution of all sources of Phoneypot
In Figure 5, we show the outdegree distribution on a log-log
scale. Outdegree of a source is deﬁned as the total number of
phoneytokens to which calls were made from that source. As it
7
Fig. 6. Age distribution of phoneytokens
We were able to ﬁnd the issue date of the NPANXX block
for only 33,271 phoneytokens. 24,985 phoneytokens were from
older blocks (year 4M), compared to those
with the states with lesser population (≤ 4M). While there
are differences, the p-value of 0.153 is not signiﬁcant enough
to conclude that the population per phoneytoken makes any
difference (refer Table II).

f) Elderly population per phoneytoken: The null hy-

coming to the top 5 states with higher population (>15%) of
elderly people, compared to states with lesser population (≤
15%) of elderly people. The results are shown in Table III.
While there are differences, the p value of 0.621 is not signiﬁ-
cant enough to conclude that the population with different age
groups makes any difference which is contrary to the popular
belief that states with elderly people receive more calls.

g) Immigrant population per phoneytoken: Based on a

believed that phone fraudsters are targeting immigrant popu-
lation. The null hypothesis states that there are no differences
between the calls coming to the states with higher percentage
(> 2.2%) of population of Asian immigrants, compared to
those with states with lesser percentage (≤ 2.2%) of Asian
immigrant population. The results are shown in Table IV. The
p-value of 0.862 is not signiﬁcant enough to conclude that
an Asian immigrant population makes any difference. Similar
statistical analysis on Hispanic/Latino population also revealed
there is no statistical signiﬁcant (p=0.1695) difference between
when it comes for Hispanic/Latino population.

VII. EVALUATING PHONEYPOT DATA
To demonstrate that Phoneypot provides high quality intel-
ligence about telephony abuse and augments existing datasets,

groups, something we can use to derive conclusions. We used a
two-tailed test, as there was no conclusive evidence to support
the use of a one-tailed test.

The p-value of 0.005 (see Table I) shows that there is
a signiﬁcant difference between the two groups which is
sufﬁcient to conclude that the phoneytokens from the older
blocks will receive higher number of calls.
D. Geographical characteristics
Population characteristics vary with geography even in one
country; for example, Florida has the densest concentration
of older people in the USA. It
is believed criminals and
scamsters have targeted older people in the pastand the same
could be true for vishing attacks. By having phoneytokens that
come from number ranges allocated to various geographical
locations, we can hope to better understand such questions.
Fig. 8. Geographical distribution of the USA phoneytokens based on area
code
Out of 39,696 phoneytokens, majority (33,267) were from
the USA and rest (190) from Canada. We also had 6,239
toll free numbers in the pool of phoneytokens. Toll free
numbers are numbers that begin with one of the following
three-digit codes: 800, 888, 877, 866, 855 or 844. Figure 8

Fig. 13. TDoS attack on a phoneytoken
ﬂood the system with too many access requests and prevent
legitimate users from accessing the system. With TDoS, the
objective is to make a signiﬁcant number of phone calls and to
keep those calls up for long durations, or to simply overwhelm
agent or circuit capacity. The impact on business and revenues
can be devastating.
We have seen one such evidence of a TDoS attack from
two phone numbers on one toll-free phoneytoken. Figure 13
shows that there are two time periods when two attack source
11
numbers have made signiﬁcant number of phone calls within a
short span of time to one phoneytoken. There were 1,500 calls
made on 30th March 2014 and another 1300 on 31st March.
Incidentally, the attacks lasted for two days before reappearing
at the end of April. There were only two sources that made all
the calls to that particular phoneytoken. Almost all the calls
were exactly one minute apart. The two sources that called this
phoneytoken were similar looking numbers (ending at 2355
and 2357), giving us an indication that probably these numbers
are spoofed. Unfortunately, we could not ﬁnd out any historical
evidence on either source phone numbers or the attack target
phoneytoken.
B. Telemarketer and Debt collector
Telemarketing is a method of direct marketing in which
a salesperson solicits prospective customers to buy products
or services over the phone. A telemarketer tries to cover as
many recipients as possible, and hangs up when he ﬁgures
out that his offer is unlikely to be accepted, which is the
most probable case. In contrast, debt collectors are businesses
that try to collect payments of debts owned by individuals or
businesses and calls are made repeatedly to the same targets.
In Figure 14(a) and 14(b), we show calling patterns of one
telemarketer and one debt collector making calls to phoneyto-
kens. As we can see in Figure 14(a), the total number of calls
is increasing with time along with the total unique targeted
phoneytokens. This is indicative of telemarketer. Whereas, in
Figure 14(b), the total number of calls is increasing but the
total targeted unique phoneytokens are constant, indicating a
debt collector. Moreover, in telemarketing (see Figure 14(c)),
there are fewer calls to more phoneytokens as compared to
the case of a debt collector (see Figure 14(d)), where there are
more calls to fewer phoneytokens.
We cross checked the source numbers with 800notes
database, and based on the complaints we found that
the
telemarketer is a scam claiming to be “Obama-care health
insurance corporation”. There were total of 4,266 calls made
by this number to the phoneytokens, however, there were only
186 complaints being reported on FTC during the same period.
We also found that the debt collector pattern source number
belongs to Allied Interstate, which is a debt collector that
has been ﬁned 1.75 million USD in 2010 [28] by the FTC
for illegal practices. There were total of 3,768 calls made by
this number to the phoneytokens, however, there were only
89 complaints being reported on FTC during the same period.
The signiﬁcantly higher number of calls in these patterns in
Phoneypot data makes it easier to detect these frauds.
IX. DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
As we mentioned, the experiments reported in this pa-
per present early results that help to gain insights into the
effectiveness of a telephony honeypot. We have not covered
any of the possible options to seed the phoneytokens and
not deployed the telephony honeypot in all possible manner
as mentioned in the paper. We leave this for future work.
Caller ID spooﬁng is another thrust area which can impact
the accuracy and performance of a telephony honeypot. It has
been explored in other research [52] and we do not address
caller ID spooﬁng problem in this paper. As with other security
