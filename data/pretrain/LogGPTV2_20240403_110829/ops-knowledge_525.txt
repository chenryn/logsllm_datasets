User: My (Python) AppEngine program fetches a web page from another site to scrape data from it -- but it seems like the 3rd party site is blocking requests from Google App Engine! -- I can fetch the page from development mode, but not when deployed.
Can I get around this by using a free proxy of some sort?
Can I use a free proxy to hide the fact that I am requesting from App Engine?
How do I find/choose a proxy? -- what do I need?  --  how do I perform the fetch?
Is there anything else I need to know or watch out for?
Assistant: Well to be fair, if they don't want you doing that then you probably shouldn't. It's not nice to be mean.
But if you really want to do it, the best approach would be creating a simple proxy script and running it on a VPS or some computer with a decent enough connection.
Basically you expose a REST API from your server to your GAE, then the server just makes all the same requests it gets to the target site and returns the output.
