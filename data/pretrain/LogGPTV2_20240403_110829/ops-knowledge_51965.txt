User: Analyze the possible failure causes of the following phenomena, and give solutions When using cache middleware, the cache service has problems such as high latency, low hit rate, high memory usage, or excessive disk I/O
Assistant: Possible causes of failure: 1. The hardware resources of the cache server are insufficient, causing the system to be unable to process a large number of requests at the same time. 2. The cache server software has bugs or misconfigurations, resulting in errors in the cache policy or conflicts with other systems. 3. The application's cache data access mode is bad, and the cache is frequently forced to refresh the cache after the cache expires or expires. 4. A large number of cache read and write operations exceed the processing capacity of the cache server, resulting in excessive consumption of server CPU and memory. 5. The storage medium is damaged or the network connection is abnormal, resulting in a large number of cache failures in a short period of time, triggering a cache avalanche. Solution: 1. Confirm whether the hardware resources meet the requirements, and set the early warning function to prompt temporarily unnecessary services to avoid sudden increase. In addition, real-time monitoring is also necessary in the running system. The traffic statistics system and log analysis tools can be used to monitor the system status and analyze the effect of early warning rules. 2. Test and debug the cache middleware to ensure that the cache policy setting is reasonable and correct. You should record the details of each service exception, find out what the problem is, and fix it. At the same time, do not ignore related operational security (such as data skew, workload management, etc.) when using cache middleware to protect the integrity and security of data in the cache. 3. The client program needs to adopt some effective design patterns to avoid the cache avalanche problem, such as common hotspot data preheating, asynchronous refresh and secondary cache, etc., can help improve the cache hit rate. 4. For a large number of read and write requests, optimize system performance and solve performance bottlenecks by using multi-threading or re-acquiring expired but still existing caches from the business side to replace the original data. 5. Establish a map of multi-active computer rooms, and pay attention to the distribution of different popular data in different regions. Adjust the hierarchical storage strategy in real time according to the read traffic, and increase the double-write mechanism for important information to reduce losses. In addition, regular backups and data synchronization between in-memory cache and disk are necessary strategies to prevent the impact of a single failure from causing all to survive.
