User: How can I play audio (it would be like a 1 second sound) from a Python script?
It would be best if it was platform independent, but firstly it needs to work on a Mac.
I know I could just execute the afplay file.mp3 command from within Python, but is it possible to do it in raw Python? I would also be better if it didn't rely on external libraries.
Assistant: If you're on OSX, you can use the "os" module or "subprocess" etc. to call the OSX "play" command.  From the OSX shell, it looks like 
play "bah.wav"
It starts to play in about a half-second on my machine.
