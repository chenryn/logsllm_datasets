User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Unsecured Guest access on Macbook Pro I am concerned that my personal, home based Macbook Pro guest network access may be being used by an outside source.  Is there a way for me to identify user access, time logged in / out, etc?

Assistant: Try:

$ cat /var/log/authd.log


This should show up events associated with user logins.
