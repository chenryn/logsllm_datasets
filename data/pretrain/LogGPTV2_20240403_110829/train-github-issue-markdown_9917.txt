Subject: Potential for Collaboration Between Seaborn and Prettyplotlib

Dear @mwaskom and @olgabot,

I recently came across seaborn through a blog post by @tyarkoni and noticed its alignment with prettyplotlib, a package you, @olgabot, have developed. From my initial exploration, it appears that seaborn focuses on extending the range of plot types supported by matplotlib, whereas prettyplotlib is geared more towards enhancing the general aesthetics and overall look of matplotlib-generated plots.

Given the complementary nature of both packages, I believe there may be an opportunity for collaboration between the two projects. This could help in reducing any duplication of effort and potentially lead to a more cohesive and powerful toolset for the data visualization community.

I would like to initiate a discussion to explore this possibility further. Your insights and thoughts on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,  
Chris L. (a.k.a. @gotgenes)
