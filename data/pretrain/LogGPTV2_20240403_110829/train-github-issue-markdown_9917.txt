I just found seaborn through a blog post by @tyarkoni. It seems to be
similarly aligned with prettyplotlib by @olgabot. My first impression is that
seaborn seems to have more emphasis on extending plot-type support of
matplotlib, while prettyplotlib is more oriented towards improving the overall
look and feel of plots produced by matplotlib, in general. I wanted to start a
discussion between the two package maintainers, @mwaskom and @olgabot, to see
if there was potential for collaboration and de-duplication of effort.
