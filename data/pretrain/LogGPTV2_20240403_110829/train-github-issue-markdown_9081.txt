I have a problem with my flutter application. On iOS, everytime I launch it, I
see a black screen for 1-2 seconds before my first screen can be loaded. The
behaviour is like the one showed in video
I have setup a splashscreen editing LaunchScreen.storyboard. This happens even
if I try to launch the default flutter app (counter), and both in emulator and
real device.
## flutter doctor -v output
