which is the missing piece of the BGLS signature scheme; it
achieves blindness by allowing signatures on committed values
and unlinkability through signature randomization. However,
it only supports sequential aggregation and does not provide
threshold aggregation. For anonymous credentials in a setting
where the signing authorities are also veriﬁers (i.e., without
public veriﬁability), Chase et al. [19] develop an efﬁcient pro-
tocol. Its ‘GGM’ variant has a similar structure to Coconut, but
forgoes the pairing operation by using message authentication
codes (MACs). None of the above schemes support threshold
issuance.
While the scheme of Garman et al. [26] does not speciﬁ-
cally focus on threshold issuance of credentials or on general
purpose credentials, it provides the ability to issue credentials
without central
issuers supporting private attributes, blind
issuance, and unlinkable multi-show selective disclosure. To
obtain a credential, users build a vector commitment to their
secret key and a set of attributes; and append it to a ledger
along with a pseudonym built from the same secret key, and
a zk-proof asserting the correctness of the vector commitment
and of the pseudonym. To show a credential under a different
pseudonym, users scan the ledger for all credentials and build
a RSA accumulator; they provide a zk-proof that they know
a credential embedded in the accumulator. Similarly to Zero-
coin [40], showing credentials requires an expensive double
discrete-logarithm proof (about 50KB [26]); and the security
of the credentials scheme relies on the security of the ledger.
Coconut addresses the two open questions left as future work
by Garman et al. [26]; (i) the security of Coconut credentials
do not depend on the security of a transaction ledger as they
are general purpose credentials, and (ii) Coconut enjoys short
and efﬁcient proofs as it builds from blind signatures and does
not require cryptographic accumulators.
c) Short and threshold issuance anonymous credentials:
Coconut extends these previous works by presenting a short,
aggregable, and randomizable credential scheme; allowing
