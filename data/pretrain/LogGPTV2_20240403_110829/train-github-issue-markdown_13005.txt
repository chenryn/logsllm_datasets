# Environment
- Windows Build Number: Version 10.0.18990.1
- Windows Terminal Version: 0.5.2762.0

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Open more tabs than can fit within the window.
2. Scroll the tab bar to view the additional tabs.

# Expected Behavior
All tabs should remain visible and fully displayed.

# Actual Behavior
Some tabs become invisible, and one tab may be partially cut off. Refer to the screenshot below, where the empty space between the last visible (but cut-off) tab and the "plus" button contains an invisible tab.

Resizing the window, even slightly, causes the previously invisible tabs to reappear.
