# Environment
    Windows build number: Version 10.0.18990.1
    Windows Terminal version: 0.5.2762.0
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Open a couple more tabs than what fits in the window
  2. Scroll the tab bar to see the new tabs
# Expected behavior
Tabs should not be invisible.
# Actual behavior
Some tabs are invisible, and one tab may be cut off. See the screenshot; the
empty space between the last tab (which is cut off) and the "plus" button
contains one invisible tab.

Resizing the window even a little makes the tabs appear.
