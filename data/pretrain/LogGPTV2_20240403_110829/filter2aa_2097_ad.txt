Maintaining a Quality Signature Database 
 Xprobe2‟s signature database is tightly controlled
 New signatures will be added to the database if, and 
only if, we can verify them against a test system we 
control or have legitimate access to
 We see the signature database issue as a mandatory 
issue for the success of the tool
 It is very easy to corrupt a signature database where it 
would lead to false and inaccurate results

Parallel Scanning Support 
 Support for parallel scanning is being added to 
Xprobe2 (currently in development)
 Xprobe2 will be able to scan class B networks fairly 
quickly 
 Since Xprobe2 uses a minimal number of packages 
per host to discover the host‟s underlying operating 
system, its overall impact on the network is minimal 
compared to other active operating system 
fingerprinting tools

The Future of Active Operating System 
Fingerprinting
 Although new and/or existing TCP/IP stack based 
fingerprinting methods can, and will, be added to 
existing active operating system fingerprinting tools 
to create a tool which uses the best of breed active 
operating system TCP/IP based stack fingerprinting 
methods, in the not so far future, we would need to 
start adding other means for actively identifying the 
underlying operating system of a remote targeted 
system

The Future of Active Operating System

 There is a certain limit to the abilities of TCP/IP stack 
fingerprinting that other methods might provide the 
remedy to
 These other methods might provide with additional 
insights that cannot be gained using the traditional 
TCP/IP stack fingerprinting methods

Using the application layer
 When an application layer based fingerprinting test is 
used, other fingerprinting tests which uses the 
transport and IP layers can be used at the same time
based on the information exchanged during the 
“setup stage” of the application based fingerprinting 
test
 Several methods:
– Generic Tests
– Application based fingerprinting tests 
– Application based fingerprinting tests targeting a specific operating 
system family or a certain group of operating systems

Banner Grabbing
 Obtaining a service banner is usually a simple 
process, nearly as simple as it takes one to change 
the banner a certain service is using
 Many operating system hardening guides contain 
instructions on how to change the banner presented 
with several services
 Therefore we should treat service banners with 
cautious
 There are unique cases in which a service banner 
cannot be altered

Banner Grabbing
 When implementing a banner-grabbing module as an 
active operating system fingerprinting module, 
different service banners should get different weights
in the overall matching process according to the 
ability and ease of changing them
 The over cautious can grant a banner grabbing 
module implementation with less impact on the overall 
fingerprinting results than other fingerprinting 
modules used

Banner Grabbing
 A banner grabbing module is not a magical solution. 
Like any other fingerprinting module, it suffers from a 
number of issues such as the inability to clearly 
identify certain versions of the operating systems, 
and/or hardware based devices

Application-based Stack Fingerprinting 
 Generic Tests
– Web Servers (HTTP Fingerprinting)
– Any other service which is widely implemented
 Group specific 
– There is a need to use a specific test which would specifically 
target an operating system family in question, and would 
provide with the required information to dismantle the group, 
and to provide a clear and decisive answer about the 
underlying operating system of the targeted machine
