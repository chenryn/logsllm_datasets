**ATT&CK ID:** C0024  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** SolarWinds Compromise

During the SolarWinds compromise, APT29 (also known as Cozy Bear) obtained Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets for Active Directory Service Principal Names (SPNs) with the intent to crack them offline. [16]

### Explanation:
- **SolarWinds Compromise:** This refers to a significant cyber-espionage campaign in which threat actors, including APT29, exploited vulnerabilities in the SolarWinds Orion software to gain unauthorized access to numerous high-profile targets.
- **APT29 (Cozy Bear):** A sophisticated state-sponsored hacking group believed to be associated with Russian intelligence services.
- **Ticket Granting Service (TGS) Tickets:** These are Kerberos tickets used to grant access to network resources. By obtaining these tickets, attackers can potentially impersonate legitimate users and gain further access within the network.
- **Service Principal Names (SPNs):** These are unique identifiers for services in an Active Directory environment. Cracking SPNs can allow attackers to discover service account credentials, which they can then use to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.

This technique highlights the importance of securing Kerberos and Active Directory environments to prevent such attacks.
