Subject: Scalability and Performance Issues When Generating Nodes in Neo4j

Hello,

I am currently working on generating nodes using the following Cypher query:

```cypher
UNWIND range(1, 700000) AS id
CREATE (:t700k {id: id})
```

### Observations and Questions

1. **Scalability and Execution Time:**
   - I have successfully generated nodes ranging from 100,000 to 600,000, but the execution time appears to increase exponentially, which raises concerns about scalability.
   - Here are the observed execution times:
     - 100,000 nodes: 1,694 ms
     - 200,000 nodes: 3,478 ms
     - 300,000 nodes: 4,622 ms
     - 400,000 nodes: 7,240 ms
     - 500,000 nodes: 19,388 ms
     - 600,000 nodes: 56,200 ms

   Is this exponential increase in execution time expected behavior, or is there a more efficient way to handle large-scale node creation?

2. **Failure at 700,000 Nodes:**
   - Attempting to generate 700,000 nodes results in an error: "Error: undefined - undefined."
   - There are no [ERROR] records in the log file located at `C:\Users\dmarkovitz\Documents\Neo4j\default.graphdb\logs\debug.log`.
