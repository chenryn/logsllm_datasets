Hi
I'm trying to generate nodes using the following code:
`unwind range(1,700000) as id create (:t700k{id:id})`
  1. 
Generating 100K-600K nodes finishes successfully but the execution time seems
to be exponential which is obviously an issue with scalability.  
Is this an expected behavior?

Generating 700K nodes fails with the following error -  
"Error: undefined - undefined"
There are also no [ERROR] records in
