Rust used to support iface-less impls. These were good because they avoided
duplicating method signatures.
Since the iface -> trait conversion these no longer seem to be supported.
Instead, it seems, a trait-less impl can only apply to class types and is
equivalent to declaring the methods inside the class body.
IMO the iface/trait-less impl was really useful. Having to declare the
iface/trait even though there will only ever be one impl seems redundant.
Is there any chance this feature could return?
