### Five Years Ago: Top Distributors and Payment Channels in Mobile Gambling Scams

#### Overview
Five years ago, the details of top distributors by lifetime were documented in Table XI of Appendix D. This section highlights the differences observed over time.

#### Payment Channels Analysis
The distribution of payment channels used in mobile gambling scams is summarized in Table VI. On average, each scam app offers 2.14 payment options. These include traditional bank transfer methods (e.g., direct debits), online payment services (e.g., WeChat Pay and Alipay, which are similar to PayPal), and more anonymous methods such as cryptocurrencies (e.g., Tether-ERC20, Tether-TRC20, CGPay) and money mule-based payments (e.g., Idlefish Money Mule and Alipay Money Mule).

#### Operational Pipeline of Idlefish Money Mule
Figure 7 illustrates the operational pipeline of the Idlefish Money Mule payment channel. Scammers recruit money mules who control both the seller and buyer accounts on the flea market app Idlefish. When a victim funds their account to gamble, the scam app triggers a task for the money mule to generate an Idlefish order and provide a Peer Pay Link. The victim then scans a QR code that redirects them to the Peer Pay Link webpage, where they complete the payment without needing to register on Idlefish. The money mule subsequently transfers the income and earns a commission.

#### Revenue Analysis
To estimate the revenue generated through Idlefish Money Mule, we placed 120 deposit requests between December 17, 2020, from 14:00 to 14:30. By analyzing the unique payment links associated with each request, we collected 26,731 paid payment links over a month (January 1, 2021, to January 31, 2021). Filtering out unrelated transactions, we estimated a daily revenue of up to $400,000 USD, with an average transaction amount of 2.7x and a number of transactions 22.3x higher than the cryptocurrency payment channel. The peak activity was observed between 10:00 and 13:00, with a lull from 4:00 to 8:00 (UTC+8).

#### Characteristics of Payment Requests
We extracted 1,500 Idlefish product information entries, with prices often in full thousands and significantly deviating from normal prices. For example, a pencil sharpener was priced at $1,538 USD. We identified 110 Idlefish stores uniquely associated with these products, all of which claimed the products were sold out when we attempted to purchase them. These stores were labeled as highly reputable but have since been taken down following our report to Idlefish.

#### Cryptocurrency Payment
For cryptocurrency payments, we collected 19 Tether (USDT) addresses and analyzed their transactions using APIs from etherscan.io and api.trongrid.io. The average daily revenue per Tether address ranged from $185.05 to $25,296.07 USD, with an average of $6,620.57 USD. The average number of transactions per day was 24.78, with each transaction averaging $267.13 USD.

#### Discussion
Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of mobile gambling scams, including social engineering, scam app generation, and distribution. We suggest deploying chatbots to gather threat intelligence and recommend that flea market apps implement techniques to detect and prevent money laundering activities. Educating mobile users about social engineering tricks and avoiding unauthorized app downloads can also help mitigate the risk of being scammed.

#### Responsible Disclosure
We reported the abuse of online app generators, push services, app signing services, and money mule payment channels to affected parties, receiving responses and acknowledgments from Apple, HUAWEI, Xiaomi, Getui, DCloud, and Idlefish. APICloud and JPush expressed gratitude and mentioned cooperation with law enforcement. Unfortunately, Meizu did not respond.
