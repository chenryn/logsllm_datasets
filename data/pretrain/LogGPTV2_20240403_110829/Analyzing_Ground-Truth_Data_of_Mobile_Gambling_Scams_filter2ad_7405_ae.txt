from 14:00 to 14:30 on December 17, 2020. We placed 120
deposit requests in total related to 101 different recipients.
Through this method, we successfully registered accounts on
92 gambling scam apps. Eight apps required a mandatory
referral code, and we observed 197 different payment channels
accepted by those scam apps.
Overview. Table VI shows the number of scam apps as-
sociated with each payment channel. On average, each app
consists of 2.14 payment options. In addition to traditional
bank payment channels (e.g., direct debits) and online payment
services to ﬁxed recipients (e.g., WeChat Pay and Alipay,
which is similar to Paypal; It allows users to send and receive
money online through their own accounts), we observe scam-
mers heavily adopt anonymous payment methods (e.g., cryp-
tocurrency, including Tether-ERC20 [63], Tether-TRC20 [64],
CGPay [65]) or use money mule-based payment methods (e.g.,
Idleﬁsh Money Mule (Section VII-A) and Alipay Money
Mule). Scammers recruit money mules with Idleﬁsh stores or
Alipay accounts to transfer gambling deposits. We observe
that scam apps sometimes disable bank payment channels and
only enable cryptocurrency and money mules, which may aim
to evade banks’ ﬁnancial censorship. Interestingly, compared
to gambling scam apps, we ﬁnd that most genuine gambling
apps deploy only traditional payment channels, such as credit
cards and wire transfers.
Compared to previous fraud research, our research intro-
duces the payment channels used in mobile gambling scams
and showcases new and stealthy channels for anonymous
transactions, i.e., Idleﬁsh Money Mules, which supplements
the traditional payment approach mentioned by previous fraud
activities (e.g., credit card by [6], [14], [66], bank transfer by
[67], [68], online payment by [9], [66], [69] and cryptocur-
rency by [70], [71]).
Below, we characterize two typical payment channels of
mobile gambling apps — Idleﬁsh Money Mule and Cryp-
tocurrency — and estimate the scamming revenue on these
two channels.
A. Idleﬁsh Money Mule
In our study, we unveil a stealthy and previously-unknown
payment channel Idleﬁsh Money Mule, which is adopted
by ﬁve scam apps in 100 investigated scam apps. Here we
Figure 8. The transaction ﬂow of Idleﬁsh Money Mule.
summarize the operational pipeline of this payment channel
discovered in our research.
Operational pipeline. Figure 7 shows that in the payment
channel of Idleﬁsh Money Mule, scammers recruit money
mules, who control sellers and buyers of a ﬂea market app
called Idleﬁsh [72], to transfer gambling deposits (). More
speciﬁcally, when a victim funds the account to gamble (),
a scam app will trigger a task, which asks a money mule
to generate an Idleﬁsh order of the account () and then
return the Peer Pay Link, which is a kind of link generated to
allow the payment by other parties (i.e., peer). The Peer Pay
Link is associated with the counterfeit Idleﬁsh order to the
victim (). After that, scam apps usually ask the victim to scan
the QR Code (which redirects the victim to the Peer Pay Link
webpage) to deposit money. The Peer Pay Link webpage looks
exactly the same as the normal online payment webpage (see
Figure 11), making the payment innocent. During the payment
procedure, victims do not need to register in IdleFish. Instead,
they pay via the Peer Pay Link in the Online Payment Apps
(e.g., AliPay). When ﬁnishing the purchase on Idleﬁsh, the
money mule will transfer the income and obtain commissions.
Paralleling the Idleﬁsh Money Mule with a traditional
money mule [13] in the underground marketplaces, the Idleﬁsh
money mule do not require goods to be shipped. The money
mules only provide fake product purchasing orders (both the
buyer and seller of the transaction are the money mules
themselves) and ask the victims to pay for this order.
Revenue analysis. As mentioned earlier, we repeatedly placed
deposit requests on scam apps with Idleﬁsh Money Mule

From analyzing network requests of the scam app, we ob-
serve that each Idleﬁsh payment request is associated with
a unique payment link (e.g., ppage.jgrkjo.cn/zfb/pc/10648**),
which records the Idleﬁsh product, its price and a timestamp.
Interestingly, the last seven-digit number of the payment link is
uniquely and continuously indexed with each payment request.
After a short period (about ﬁve minutes), the payment status
will be changed to “paid” or “expired”, and the page shows
either “this order has been paid” or “this order has been
expired.” By traversing these auto-increment payment links,
we are able to collect all
links of our
measurement duration (26,731 in total).
the paid payment
Since deposits via this payment channel do not necessarily
come from the gambling scam apps, we refer to the daily
revenue as an “upper bound” estimation. Inspired by [71], we
ﬁlter potentially unrelated transactions to victims by known
deposit payment patterns. For example, some scam apps only
allow users to deposit ¥2,000, ¥5,000 or ¥10,000 CNY (about
$307, $769, $1538 USD). Thus, transactions differing from
those amounts will be eliminated. This method enables us to
estimate the revenue under the payment channel of Idleﬁsh
Money Mule. To this end, we study 17,144 payment records,
where yields a revenue of $400,000 USD per day with 553.03
transactions. The daily revenue from the Idleﬁsh is about 60x
larger than the cryptocurrency payment channel (as discussed
in Section VII-B). Its average transaction amount is 2.7x, while
the number of transactions is 22.3x. We observe that the peak
often occurs between 10:00 and 13:00 and the valley from
4:00 - 8:00 (UTC+8). There are no transactions between 23:00
- 24:00, which may be their server downtime for maintenance.
Here we acknowledge the limitation of our revenue analysis:
while we have tried our best to eliminate transactions unrelated
to victims, the transactions used for revenue estimation could
still include non-gambling scam deposits. Hence, we consider
the results as the “upper bound” estimation.
Payment request characteristics. Given those payment links,
we extract 1,500 Idleﬁsh product information entries in the cat-
egories of furniture (47.4%), clothes (14.6%), jewels (8.1%),
handbags (6.13%), etc. Interestingly, we observe the prices of
these products are always in full thousands and largely deviate
from the normal prices (e.g., a pencil sharpener for $1,538
USD).
We determine 631 products with signiﬁcant price deviation
(i.e., the price is 10 times more than the normal price; Here
the normal price is calculated from the average price of top-
20 search results for the same product in Idleﬁsh) and search
for them on Idleﬁsh to identify the potential Idleﬁsh stores
of these products for manual validation. In this way, we ﬁnd
110 Idleﬁsh stores uniquely associated with these products.
When we try to bypass the gambling platform to purchase
these products, these stores all claim products have been sold
out and refuse to sell. Surprisingly, Idleﬁsh label all of those
stores as highly reputable. We have reported our ﬁndings to
Idleﬁsh, which has taken down those illicit stores.

Finding XII: We unveil a stealthy and previously unknown
payment channel, Idleﬁsh Money Mule, and observe up to
$400,000 USD daily revenue in this channel.
B. Cryptocurrency Payment
In our study, we collect 19 Tether (USDT) addresses
related to cryptocurrency payments. Due to the transaction
traceability of Tether, we can estimate the upper bound of
total gambling deposits under these addresses. Speciﬁcally,
we gather all transactions of these 19 addresses via List
Token Transfer Events Restful API provided by ether-
scan.io [73], api.trongrid.io [74] for Tether-ERC20 and Tether-
TRC20, respectively. Similar to the “upper bound” analysis of
Idleﬁsh Money Mule, we ﬁlter transactions that are potentially
unrelated to victims by known deposit payment patterns.
Some scam apps only allow users to deposit money at least
¥100 CNY (about $15 USD). Thus transactions less than
this threshold are eliminated. This enables us to estimate the
revenue under the payment channel of Tether. To this end, we
collected 7,900 payment records from 19 Tether addresses.
Figure 9 illustrates gambling deposit volumes over time. We
observe that the average daily revenue of each Tether address
ranges from $185.05 to $25,296.07 USD, with an average
of $6,620.57 USD. The average number of transactions per
day is 24.78, with $267.13 USD per transaction. The list of
cryptocurrency addresses can be found in Table XVII.
Finding XIII: Gambling scam apps are in favor of Tether
(USDT) and CGPay as the Cryptocurrency payment chan-
nel.
VIII. DISCUSSION
Our study analyzes a ground-truth dataset of mobile gam-
bling scams with 1,487 scam apps and 1,461 incident reports,
which is the largest conﬁrmed scam apps and ground-truth
incident records dataset ever reported. We found evidence
through our extensive analyses of the kill chain of mobile
gambling scams ranging from social engineering tricks to
scam app generation and distribution, which fuels the inter-
national scam activities. When interpreted by professionals,
our initial results demonstrate useful ﬁndings and may be

for impactful structural interventions to the mobile gambling
scam. In particular, we suggest a suite of mitigation approaches
below.
A fundamental prerequisite to mitigate such security issues
is the effective detection of gambling scam apps on a large
scale. In our study, we proﬁle scam apps to point out po-
tential features that can be used for detection. Speciﬁcally,
considering characteristics of scam apps, instead of operating
maliciously (e.g., stealing personal information), we ﬁnd the
design of scam apps aim at (1) increasing users’ “sticki-
ness,” e.g., integrating push service to send users notiﬁcations
(Section VI-B); (2) guaranteeing app reachability, e.g., using
the sideloading technique (Section VI-A) with low minimum
platform API level requirement (Section VI-D); (3) equipped
with stealthy payment channels, especially those anonymous
payment methods such as cryptocurrency and money mule
(Section VII). Different from web-based fraudulent activi-
ties, we observe scam apps usually distributed via one-on-
one conversations on IM and social apps (e.g., dating apps)
(Section V-B). We suggest deploying a chatbot
to gather
threat intelligence (i.e., app download link) related to such
scamming activities, further empowering the scam app detec-
tion. In addition, we provide the details of abusive apps in
Appendix E (Table XIII, XIV, XV, XVI and X), which can
also help the community to understand this threat.
Perhaps importantly, our study sheds light on two rela-
tively under-explored stakeholders in mobile scam activities,
i.e., online app generators, which was abused for scam app
generation, and the ﬂea market app (e.g., Idleﬁsh), where
money mules host illicit stores for money laundering. We
suggest these two parties contribute to the disruption of the
mobile gambling scam, e.g., ﬂea market apps should deploy
techniques to detect stores involved in money laundering
(such as selling products with abnormal prices or suspicious
transactions).

IX. RELATED WORKS
Studies on phishing and scam activities. Numerous studies
have looked into phishing [77], [78], [79], [80] and scam activ-
ity [5], [6], [4] proﬁling and detection. For example, Kharraz
et al. [5] automatically identiﬁed the survey scam ecosystem
using learning techniques. Miramirkhani et al. [6] performed
a systematic study of technical support scams and identiﬁed
their infrastructure and campaign. Dam et al. [4] performed
large-scale analysis of pop-up scams on typosquatting URLs
and present characteristics of such web-based scam campaigns.
Hao et al. [13] gave insights into the underground economy
behind reshipping scams, which launder money through ac-
quiring expensive goods via stolen credit cards. Park et al. [25]
presented a data-driven empirical analysis of targeted Nigerian
scams observed on Craigslist based on a scam dataset collected
by experiment. Apart from the web-based scam, a mobile-
based scam shows quite different technical details and luring
strategies. FraudDroid [8] dynamically analyzes the app’s UI
state transition and network trafﬁc to detect ad fraud in mobile
Android apps. Hu et al. [9] performed a study to detect
and comprehend the characteristics of fraudulent dating apps.
Unlike previous research, which is mainly based on external
measurement without the validation of scamming behaviors,
with the help of ground-truth data of mobile gambling scam
apps, we are capable of analysing this new trending scam with
the kill chain of gambling scams.
The closest to our study are [81] and [82], which discuss
the ecosystem of online gambling and their third-party online
payment and network infrastructures. However, both papers
focus on online gambling instead of the gambling scam.
Malicious/Illicit mobile apps detection and analysis. Ma-
licious/illicit mobile apps detection has been studied for
long. On the Android platform, Zhou et al. [83] system-
atized or characterized existing Android malware with more
than 1,200 samples. Arp et al. [84] combined static anal-
ysis and linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) technique
to detect Android malware Applications with explanations.
Zhang et al. [85] classiﬁed Android malware via dependency
graphs by extracting a weighted contextual API dependency
graph as program semantics to construct feature sets. More
recently, Mclaughlin et al. [86] proposed a new detection
method for Android malware that uses a deep Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). The neural network automatically
learns malware features from the raw opcode series, thereby
eliminating the need for hand-engineered malware features.
Zhang et al. [87] proposed to incorporate domain knowledge
into machine learning models to better detect fast-evolving
malware variants.
Different from numerous malware analysis works on An-
droid, little has been done on iOS applications. PiOS [88]
leverages static analysis to detect privacy leakage in iOS
apps. iRiS [89] also proposes a dynamic analysis approach
In addition, educating mobile users is still one of the most
effective ways to prevent individuals from being scammed [6],
[75]. We recommend passing on knowledge about social
engineering tricks (Section V) as scam awareness training
materials, including how scammers establish connections with
victims, how scammers promote scam apps, how scammers
lure victims to continually deposit money and explaining
the gambling scam logic. Our investigation (Section VI-A)
also reveals that few scamming apps are indexed in famous
application markets like Apple App Store or Google Play.
Avoiding downloading apps from unauthorized channels is
recommended to battle scam apps.
Responsible Disclosure. We reported the abuse of online app
generators, push services, app signing services, and money
mules payment channels to the affected parties and received
responses and acknowledges from Apple, HUAWEI, Xiaomi,
Getui, DCloud and Idleﬁsh. APICloud and JPush expressed
gratitude for our help and mentioned that they would cooperate
with the law enforcement departments for further action.
Unfortunately, we did not receive any response from Meizu
