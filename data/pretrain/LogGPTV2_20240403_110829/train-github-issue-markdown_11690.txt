Hi,
I am in the process of migrating our codebase to React 0.14.x. During this I
encountered a problem, because of the fact that our client side uses
`React.renderToStaticMarkup` to render React components and passing the
results around as strings (I know, not ideal, but given what our codebase was
previously, this is sadly needed for us in some cases).
However, given my understanding of the structural changes with `react` and
`react-dom` packages, as I can tell, I am not supposed to simply call
`React.renderToStaticMarkup` any more, and the API is not accessible from the
`react-dom` package. I do not use webpack (yet!), so at the moment using
`react-dom/server` is not appropriate for me.
What is the supported way (if any?) of calling `React.renderToStaticMarkup` in
the browser, using the pre-built packages?
