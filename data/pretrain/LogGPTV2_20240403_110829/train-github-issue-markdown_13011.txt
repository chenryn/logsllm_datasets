In our research group we all have user accounts on a server where we each run
our own experiments (Ubuntu behind the scenes). By default, everyone is
downloading `transformers` models to their own home directory. Let's say we
have 20 researchers, that might mean that we have 20 duplicates of "bert-base-
cased" on the server (and of many other models). This is not efficient at all
and takes too much room to our liking.
We have tried creating a 777 directory as TRANSFORMERS_CACHE globally, but
that does not work. If I download a model, some of the downloaded files get a
read/write access for me as the creator of the file. This means that others
cannot use the model (permission denied).
Our suggestion or request would be to have an option when downloading a model
to also set its permissions for all downloaded files. Preferably adjustable
via a (system-wide) environment variable. This would probably need to be added
in file_utils.py, similar to other options like "local_files_only".
I currently do not have time to work on this myself, but I am open to any
feedback of course.
