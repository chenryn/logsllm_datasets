When I open my Command Prompt, the default path is `C:\Users\acer>`. I would like to change the path to `C:\Python27`. Here is the method I have tried:

1. I entered `cd..` twice.
2. Then, I entered `cd.. Python27`.

Since my `Python27` folder is located in the `C:\` directory, I expected this to work. However, I received the following error message: "The system cannot find the path specified."

Can anyone help me with this issue?

**Assistant:**

Instead of entering `cd.. Python27`, you should type:

```sh
cd \Python27
```

This command will directly change your current directory to `C:\Python27`.
