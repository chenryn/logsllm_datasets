Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

When attempting to import the `prefixes` from the AWS IP ranges JSON file using the following code:

```javascript
import { prefixes } from "https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" assert { type: "json" };
```

I encountered the following error:

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json' does not provide an export named 'prefixes'
```

However, the JSON file does contain a `prefixes` field. For reference, here is a screenshot of the JSON structure:

My current Deno version is:

```sh
deno --version
deno 1.34.1 (release, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
v8 11.5.150.2
typescript 5.0.4
```

I am looking for guidance on how to correctly access the `prefixes` field using Deno. Any hints or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
