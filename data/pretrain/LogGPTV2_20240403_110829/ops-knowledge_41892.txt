I have created a virtual environment for my project, but I am unable to activate it. The issue might be related to syntax or folder location, but I am currently at a loss.

Below are the steps I followed:
1. I created the virtual environment using the command `virtualenv --no-site-packages venv`. The creation process seemed to complete successfully.
2. I then attempted to activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate`.

However, I received the following error message:
```
'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

I suspect the issue might be related to my system path, but I am unsure what to point it to (I do know how to edit the path). I am using Python 3.7 on a Windows operating system with virtualenv version 20.2.x.

Here is the detailed output from the commands:

The --no-site-packages flag is deprecated; it is now the default behavior.

Could you please help me resolve this issue?

Additionally, for Windows, you should use the following command to activate the virtual environment:
```plaintext
venv\Scripts\activate
```

This should work correctly.
