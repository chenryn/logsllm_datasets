### Description
The current `className` prop on any JSX element takes only a string, that is
supposed to be the class name to add to the corresponding element. This prop
expects a string which makes it very easy to attach a single class name to the
element.
For example:
### Problem
The limitation I ran into while using className, is when I wanted to attach a
couple classes to the same element, I naturally tried to do something like
this:
But unfortunately it didn't work, I then realized that it's not possible with
the current JSX specification.
The proposed solution in the FAQ link I shared above suggests manually
attaching the strings and add a space, or use another package called
"Classnames".
### Feature Proposal
I as a react user, expected naturally that I could provide multiple classes
with JSX, so I think it can be useful for other developers, if the prop
`className` can take an array of strings (classes) and does a simple
`Array.join(" ")` in this case. So that developers won't have to join them
manually or use the other package "Classnames". I believe this could be
beneficial for the simple use case, and also for a more advanced use case like
mine (using Material UI's `makeStyles`).
I would appreciate your thoughts on this suggestion. Furthermore, if
discussion concludes that you agree to adopt such change, I would be more than
happy to contribute it, as by chance I was looking at the beginner-friendly
issues for contributors a couple days ago and couldn't find something (they're
all assigned).
