  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Steps to Reproduce (i don't know if bugs)
  1. Upgrade to version 5 of next
  2. In dev mode the terminal tells me the 404 error of the js source map
  3. Keep running my application, but the message bothers me, I do not know if it's ok
## Context
My big mental problem, is not knowing if this is a normal behavior or I have
something wrong with my next application configuration or in the browser.  
Terminal:
