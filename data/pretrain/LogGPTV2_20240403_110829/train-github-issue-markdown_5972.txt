I have a classic JPA configuration in which I'm using Hibernate. I'd like to
switch to Infinispan for 2nd level- and query caching. Mainly because this
cache takes the transaction into account. This is for a standalone deployment
on Tomcat.
However, there is no way yet to integrate the Spring transaction manager for
Infinispan. (At least, I didn't found a way.)
            org.hibernate.cache.infinispan.InfinispanRegionFactory
            true
            true
            true
            ... something of Spring should be here ... 
            create
            1000
            false
            ${database.hibernate.dialect}
