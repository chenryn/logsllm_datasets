### Describe the issue:
According to the documentation I should be able to create a complex number
with `numpy.cdouble(real=1.0, imag=2.0)` but this returns
    TypeError: function takes at most 1 argument (2 given)
Same applies to `complex_` and `complex128`, since they are all the same as
far as I understand.  
Not sure if this is a bug in the code or an outdated section in the
documentation.  
I tested this with Numpy 1.22.3 compiled from source and with Numpy 1.22.4
installed from PyPi, both on Windows 10.
### Reproduce the code example:
    import numpy
    numpy.cdouble(real=1.0, imag=2.0)
### Error message:
    TypeError: function takes at most 1 argument (2 given)
### NumPy/Python version information:
