Question: "During a security audit of a proprietary communication protocol, you discover several instances where the protocol permits negotiation of cryptographic algorithms between the server and the client. Which of the following scenarios would NOT indicate a vulnerability related to the 'Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation'?"
 "A": "The protocol defaults to the strongest mutual algorithm but allows a client to request a weaker algorithm, which the server may accept based on a predefined security policy."
 "B": "The server and client start with high-strength algorithms, but an attacker can interfere in the negotiation phase, causing both to fall back to a less secure algorithm without detection."
 "C": "The protocol is hardcoded to use a single, well-vetted encryption algorithm, which does not allow for any negotiation or alteration by either party."
 "D": "During negotiation, the server offers a list of algorithms ranked by strength, but due to a flaw, it accepts a client's request for a weaker algorithm that is lower on the list."
Answer: C
