Install Ansible: Install Ansible on the management machine, you can use apt, yum or pip to install, and check whether the installation is successful after the installation is complete. 2. Configure Ansible: configure the hosts file of Ansible, and add the IP address or domain name of the server to be managed to the hosts file. 3. Write the script: Write an Ansible script that contains instructions for software and services that need to be installed and configured, as well as variable definitions for the target server. 4. Execute the script: Use the ansible-playbook command to execute the script, which will automatically upload the script to the target server and run the instructions in it. 5. Check the execution result: Check the execution result. If there is an error or failure, the script needs to be readjusted. 6. Perform updates: perform updates regularly, update playbooks and Ansible, and keep server software and configurations updated. In general, using Ansible to automatically manage the software installation and configuration of a group of servers is an efficient, reliable and flexible way that can greatly reduce the time and errors of manual management.
