User: If you give in the command "atom ." in the terminal, the Atom editor opens the current folder and I am ready to code.
I am trying to achieve the same with Pycharm using Ubuntu: get the current directory and open it with Pycharm as a project.
Is there way to achieve this by setting a bash alias?
Assistant: PyCharm can be launched using the charm command line tool (which can be installed while getting started with PyCharm the first time).
charm .
