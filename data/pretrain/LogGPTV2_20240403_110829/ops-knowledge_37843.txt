User: I'm using python 2.5 in windows on a macbook pro with IDLE. How do I get previously typed commands in the python shell? In other operating systems I've managed to do this using 'ctrl' + 'up arrow' or a similar combination. I've tried all likely combinations without success.
Thanks.
Assistant: I just realized that I can find this out in 'Options -> Configure IDLE -> Keys'
It's 'alt + p' for IDLE. Thanks for the suggestion pfote - I will take a look.
