- **y-axis:** Cumulative Number of Encoded Stripes
- **Legend:**
  - Testbed
  - RR Simulation
  - EAR Simulation

**Observations:**
- The simulator accurately captures the encoding performance under both Round-Robin (RR) and Efficient Allocation and Replication (EAR) strategies.
- The cumulative number of encoded stripes over time is closely matched between the testbed and simulations, validating the simulator's accuracy.

**Table I: Validation of Write Response Times**

| Time (in seconds) | Without Encoding | With Encoding |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Testbed**       | 1.43             | 2.45          |
| **RR Simulation** | 1.40             | 2.35          |
| **EAR Simulation**| 1.40             | 2.04          |
| **Testbed**       | 1.42             | 2.13          |

**Notes:**
- The response time differences between the testbed experiments and discrete-event simulations are less than 4.3%, confirming the simulator's precision in capturing write performance.

### Simulator Overview

**Figure 11: Simulator Overview**

- **Components:**
  - **PlacementManager:** Manages data placement decisions.
  - **TrafficManager:** Generates three types of traffic:
    1. Write Traffic
    2. Encoding Traffic
    3. Background Traffic
  - **Topology:** Manages the CFS topology, including cross-rack and intra-rack link resources.

**Details:**
- The Topology module holds resources for the duration of a request, subject to the specified link bandwidth.
- The TrafficManager module generates and feeds the traffic streams to the Topology module.
- The PlacementManager module provides replica placement decisions for write and encoding requests.
- Background requests involve transmitting data to another node, either in the same or different rack.

### Large-Scale Evaluation

**Experiment B.2: Impact of Parameter Choices**

- **Configuration:**
  - CFS with R = 20 racks, each containing 20 nodes.
  - Nodes in the same rack connected via a 1Gb/s top-of-rack switch.
  - All top-of-rack switches connected via a 1Gb/s network core.
  - Data stored with 3-way replication, replicas in two racks.
  - Data encoded with (n, k) = (14, 10) erasure coding, tolerating up to 4-node or 4-rack failures.

**Parameters Varied:**
- **k (number of data blocks):** 6, 8, 10, 12
- **n-k (number of parity blocks):** 2, 4, 6, 8
- **Link Bandwidth (Gb/s):** 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0
- **Number of Replicas:** 1, 2, 3, 4
- **Write Request Rate (requests/second):** 1, 2, 4

**Figures:**

  - **x-axis:** k
  - **y-axis:** Normalized Throughput
- **(b) Varying n-k:**
  - **x-axis:** n-k
  - **y-axis:** Normalized Throughput
- **(c) Varying Link Bandwidth:**
  - **x-axis:** Link Bandwidth (Gb/s)
  - **y-axis:** Normalized Throughput
- **(d) Varying Number of Replicas:**
  - **x-axis:** Number of Replicas
  - **y-axis:** Normalized Throughput
- **(e) Varying Write Request Rate:**
  - **x-axis:** Write Request Rate (requests/second)
  - **y-axis:** Normalized Throughput

**Observations:**
- The simulator evaluates the impact of different parameters on the performance of RR and EAR.
- The results show how varying these parameters affects the normalized throughput for both write and encode operations.
