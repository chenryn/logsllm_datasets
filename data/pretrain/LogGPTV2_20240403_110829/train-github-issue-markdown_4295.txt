### Apache Airflow version
2.3.2 (latest released)
### What happened
I accidentally created two dags with the same name.  
No errors were given.  
Code-tab in web-ui showed one of the versions.  
Running the task actually executed the second version.
### What you think should happen instead
One, or both DAGs should be rejected and pop up a dag import error in the UI  
Starting the dag should not be possible.
### How to reproduce
Create two dags with same name.  
Start dag
### Operating System
Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)
