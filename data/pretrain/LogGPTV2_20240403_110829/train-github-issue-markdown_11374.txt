IMHO FCC needs better support for commenting in code... the intructions for
Delete your jQuery Functions _do say delete_ but while working on code
commenting out suspicious parts or just leaving notes is typically a good
practice. FCC actively discourages this.
I commented out the code to be deleted
    // $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
        // $(".well").addClass("animated shake");
        // $("#target3").addClass("animated fadeOut");
but FCC didn't 'PASS' the test.
Challenge Delete your jQuery Functions has an issue.
