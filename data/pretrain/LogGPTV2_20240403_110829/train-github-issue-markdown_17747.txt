### Version
2.5.16
### Reproduction link
https://codesandbox.io/s/rllvz0m21o
### Steps to reproduce
  1. Create a "renderless" component that passes data into the default scoped-slot.
    render () {
      return this.$scopedSlots.default(this)
    },
  2. Have a component that uses the "renderless" component as root and then populates the scoped-slot with its own template.
  3. Have two components with regular slots where one is tunneling the passed content into the second slot. The slots can have different names, it does not affect the issue. Like this:
  4. Somehow force the "renderless" component to update.
### What is expected?
No warning should be shown.
### What is actually happening?
It triggers the warning:
    Duplicate presence of slot "sep" found in the same render tree - this will likely cause render errors.
    found in
    --->  at /src/components/MiddleComponent.vue
It might also work incorrectly or trigger additional unnecessary re-renders.

The source code responsible for showing the warning was probably meant for
detecting the usage of slots inside v-for loops. However, in this case, it
seems to be called incorrectly since the slot is only rendered once. The
reason for this might be that the `rendered` flag is not being reset in this
situation. Not using a renderless component (doing tunneling outside of a
scoped-slot) does not trigger the error. Using scoped-slots instead of regular
slots also does not trigger the warning, but thatâ€™s because the check is
skipped.
This is potentially related to #8546.
