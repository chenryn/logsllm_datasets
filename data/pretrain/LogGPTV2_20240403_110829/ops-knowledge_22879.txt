Question: "As an Android platform security engineer, you are tasked with ensuring that a new system service, which is critical for device functionality, adheres to the SELinux 'neverallow' rules and the correct placement of SEPolicy in Android 8.0+. The service is meant to interact only with other system components and should not require interaction with vendor-specific components or policies. Where should the SEPolicy for this new service be placed?"
 "A": "In `system/sepolicy/private` since it is only needed for the system image and does not interact with vendor components."
 "B": "In `device/manufacturer/device-name/sepolicy` to ensure it is included in the vendor image."
 "C": "In `BOARD_SEPOLICY_DIRS` as it is meant for device augmentation across different device types."
 "D": "In `system/sepolicy/public` to ensure the policy persists across releases and is available for vendor customization."
Answer: A
