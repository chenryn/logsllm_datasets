ROAlert also notiﬁed administrators of “loose ROAs”, i.e.,
when their preﬁx is valid but in fact unprotected and had 19%
success rate. We conclude that a proactive, non-opt-in alert
system can help mitigate bad ROAs.
Limitations. ROAlert relies on information from the Whois
databases in order to contact victims and offenders. However,
whois entries are often outdated, resulting in unreachable email
addresses (see measurements above). Consequently, only a
fairly small fraction of victims and violators were alerted. We
believe, based on our experience with ROAlert and the above
results, that ROAlert can aid in greatly reducing the number
of bad ROAs, thus increasing the level of trust in RPKI. We
hope that these results will motivate the RIRs, which have more
reliable contact points to preﬁx owners, to adopt ROAlert.
Selective, ROAlert-informed ROV. While ROAlert and simi-
lar mechanisms could hopefully contribute to eliminating many
badly issued ROAs, surely some bad-ROAs will remain. To
address this concern we propose that ASes enforce ROV
selectively, i.e., enforce ROV for ROAs that have been “well-
behaved” for a pre-deﬁned amount of time. ROAlert allows
this to be automated (by identifying new ROAs, and marking
them “well-behaved” if they do not conﬂict with BGP adver-
tisements for sufﬁcient period).
Of course,
this is not
immune to pitfalls. What
if an
organization changes its set of IP preﬁxes advertised in BGP in
a manner that is incompatible with a previously issued ROA by
the same organization? This might still lead to the organization
being disconnected by those doing selective ROV. We point
out, however, that using a platform like ROAlert implies that
the organization would be quickly notiﬁed when its preﬁx
becomes invalid.
We argue that the use of selective ROV could mitigate the
justiﬁed concerns about discarding BGP advertisements due to
mistakes in ROAs, while protecting issuers of “good” ROAs
from preﬁx and subpreﬁx hijacking.
B. Wildcard ROAs
Downward dependencies, discussed in Section VI-B, pose a
challenge to deployment of RPKI by some large organizations,
e.g., Orange in Figure 11. Consider a large IP preﬁx p, with
origin AS number a, owned by organization Foo. Suppose
that several subpreﬁxes p1, . . . pn are contained within p, but
belong to other organizations and in particular, have different
origin ASes, a1, . . . an. Suppose further that these organiza-
tions have not yet issued a ROA for these preﬁxes.
Foo may go ahead and issue a ROA for p, specifying origin
a. That was, for instance, the approach taken by Orange in
Figure 11. However, the result is that BGP advertisements for
p1, . . . pn (that belong to Danone and Ubisoft in our example),
would conﬂict with the ROA for p and hence be discarded by
ROV-enforcing ASes.
Alternatively, Foo may choose to break p into subpreﬁxes
that are entirely owned by Foo and only issue ROAs for
these preﬁxes and advertise them in BGP (instead of p in its
entirety). However, this may result in signiﬁcant increase to
BGP routing tables. We evaluate this possibility by testing the
increase ratio in BGP table size. We used the Route Views
dataset [54] to build the Routing Information Base (RIB)
for each of the 44 different sensors (BGP routers located
in different and geographically dispersed ASes). We then
measured, for each sensor, the increase in the number of RIB
entries. We ﬁnd that on average, the increase is over 26% of
preﬁxes in the routing tables, or approximately 160K preﬁxes
(the standard deviation was approximately 2%).
We now present a simple alternative solution, called wild-
card ROA, which allows organizations to issue ROAs and
protect their IP preﬁxes before their descendants issue ROAs
for themselves. Wildcard ROAs are intended to allow an AS
holding an RC that covers an address block containing a
speciﬁc IP preﬁx pi not belonging to that AS to specify that
any AS may be the origin of that preﬁx (pi). Thus, any AS
with an RC could issue a ROA for itself without having to
wait for its descendants to do the same (or giving up on BGP
aggregation) simply by issuing another ROA, using a “wildcard
AS number”, that includes all subpreﬁxes that are no longer in
its possession and thus may be announced using other ASNs.
Importantly, however, wildcard ROAs must be assigned a lower
priority than “regular” ROAs for the same preﬁx, so that if a
speciﬁc IP preﬁx is included in both a regular ROA (issued
by the legitimate owner) and (possibly many) wildcard ROAs,
the regular ROA prevails, thus protecting the legitimate owner
from hijacking and eliminating the downward-dependency
problem.
VIII. RELATED WORK
There is a long history of attacks against BGP, which moti-
vated many past studies on analyzing BGP’s vulnerabilities and
on designing defenses. See an overview of the security issues
in [11], [29] and a study of common misconﬁgurations in [43].
For an example of one of the earliest designs, suggesting many
of the basic ideas underlying both RPKI and BGPsec, see [36].
We focus below on the studies most relevant to deployment.
Several studies, beginning with [13], explore deployment
of path-security mechanisms, mainly BGPsec. Gill et al. [23]
study how to encourage adoption of BGPsec by creating
appropriate incentives for ISPs to deploy it. Other studies [26]
explore the security guarantees of BGPsec, including under
partial deployment [41]. Many other studies, e.g., [50], present
alternative path-security mechanisms which are easier to de-
ploy. See a survey of the long and winding road to BGP
security in [25].
Adoption of RPKI was also studied. In [37], a provider,
SURFnet, studied the false-positive rate it would incur if it
performed ROV. Several studies [19], [33], [34] explore the
issuing of ROAs and measure the number of preﬁxes that
would be discarded with ROV. A study of ROAs covering
content provider preﬁxes was presented in [57]. These stud-
ies, however, did not address the issues we focus on, such
as quantifying the adoption of ROV and its beneﬁts under
partial deployment, loose ROAs, upward and downward inter-
organizational dependencies, designing an online alert system,
and more.
Wahlisch et al. present preliminary results of a survey
of network operators regarding deployment of RPKI and
DNSsec [56]. Indeed, many of the challenges of deploying
and enforcing DNSsec and RPKI are similar; see [40] for a
study comparing deployment of DNSsec with deployment of
RPKI, and [30] for discussion on the deployment of DNSsec.
Other studies [17], [28] investigate another problematic aspect
of RPKI: disproportionate power of centralized authorities to
unilaterally revoke any IP preﬁxes under their control.
Network operators sometimes rely on repositories such
as IRR/RADB to ﬁlter suspicious BGP route-advertisements.
Like RPKI, these repositories bind IP preﬁxes to origin ASes
and can thus be used to realize ﬁltering policies, including
additional ﬁltering beyond route-origin validation (see [27]).
However, these repositories are not fully reliable/secure and
contain numerous errors, as highlighted and measured in [31].
IRR/RADB repositories are typically used, in practice, only to
ﬁlter incorrect BGP advertisements from customer ASes [21],
[44] and thus provide quite limited security beneﬁts.
IX. CONCLUSION
Extensive efforts have been invested, for many years
now, to improve the security and reliability of BGP routing.
These efforts range from a patchwork of ad-hoc mechanisms
(monitoring services, IRR/RADB registries, etc.) to carefully
designed standards such as RPKI and BGPsec. Recent studies
have shown that deployment of BGPsec faces signiﬁcant,
possibly insurmountable challenges. In contrast, RPKI de-
ployment, crucial both for combating IP preﬁx and subpreﬁx
hijacking and as a prerequisite to defenses against BGP path-
manipulations (incl. BGPsec), is regarded as more feasible.
Indeed, monitoring of RPKI certiﬁcates and ROAs indicates
progress, although at a hardly satisfactory rate.

Our results showed that not only does RPKI suffer from
very low deployment, but even Route Origin Validation (ROV),
which uses RPKI to defend against preﬁx hijacking, is rarely
enforced. Since ROV is the ﬁrst and only use of RPKI so far,
its deployment and RPKI’s deployment suffer from the classic
chicken and egg problem. We investigated the implications of
ROV’s scarce adoption to global routing security, showing that
almost ubiquitous deployment of ROV by the largest ISPs (e.g.,
top 100) is both necessary and sufﬁcient to protect the Internet
from preﬁx and subpreﬁx hijacking. We showed, however,
that unless many RPKI records are ﬁxed, even global ROV
adoption will not protect many networks from devastating
trafﬁc hijacking attacks.
We embarked on a systematic study of the root-causes
for RPKI’s slow adoption, including negative incentives for
deployment due to loss of trafﬁc as a result of badly issued
ROAs, and inter-organization dependencies. On the positive
side, our results show that many of the banes plaguing RPKI
and ROV deployment can be vastly improved via highly
focused efforts. Speciﬁcally, focusing deployment efforts on
the large ISPs, modest changes to RPKI, and adoption of a
system such as ROAlert by entities such as the RIRs, can
go a long way towards mitigating obstacles to adoption. We
thus advocate concentrating standardization, regulatory, and
operational efforts in these directions.
