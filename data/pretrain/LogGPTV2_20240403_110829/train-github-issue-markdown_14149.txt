**Use case / motivation**
Hi, Airflow team  
This issue is not related to the Airflow feature, but to the GitHub action
control.  
I am talking with the GitHub Action team, as I noticed, sometimes, the ASF
GitHub action has very limited slots for Apache SkyWalking.  
GitHub did some research, and at least found one task from the Airflow
project,  
https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/259069303
This task lasts over 6 hours until GitHub action platform terminated it. Could
you help with rechecking why it last so long?
