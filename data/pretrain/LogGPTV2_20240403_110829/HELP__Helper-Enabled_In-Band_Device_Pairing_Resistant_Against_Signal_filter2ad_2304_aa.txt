Abstract
Bootstrapping trust between wireless devices without en-
tering or preloading secrets is a fundamental security
problem in many applications, including home network-
ing, mobile device tethering, and the Internet-of-Things.
This is because many new wireless devices lack the nec-
essary interfaces (keyboard, screen, etc.) to manually en-
ter passwords, or are often preloaded with default keys
that are easily leaked. Alternatively, two devices can es-
tablish a common secret by executing key agreement pro-
tocols. However, the latter are vulnerable to Man-in-the-
Middle (MitM) attacks. In the wireless domain, MitM
attacks can be launched by manipulating the over-the-air
transmissions. The strongest form of manipulation is sig-
nal cancellation, which completely annihilates the signal
at a targeted receiver. Recently, cancellation attacks were
shown to be practical under predictable channel condi-
tions, without an effective defense mechanism.
In this paper, we propose HELP, a helper-assisted mes-
sage integrity veriﬁcation primitive that detects message
manipulation and signal cancellation over the wireless
channel (rather than prevent it). By leveraging transmis-
sions from a helper device which has already established
trust with one of the devices (e.g., the hub), we enable
signal tampering detection with high probability. We
then use HELP to build a device pairing protocol, which
securely introduces new devices to the network without
requiring them to share any secret keys with the exist-
ing devices beforehand. We carry out extensive analysis
and real-world experiments to validate the security and
performance of our proposed protocol.

Introduction
In recent years, we have experienced a proliferation
of advanced personal wireless devices (APDs) such as
smartwatches, wearable sensors, RFID devices, home
monitoring sensors for Internet-of-Things applications,
etc. [38]. These devices often connect to a gateway/hub
(e.g., a Wi-Fi access point) for data collection or for re-
mote actuation. Securing the communication between
APDs and the hub is of paramount importance when the
former collect sensitive data, or can control critical func-
tions within their environment. The process of establish-
ing trust between the APD and the hub is known as se-
cure bootstrapping and is achieved via a two-party mu-
tual authentication and key-agreement mechanism.
The prevailing methods for secure device bootstrap-
ping are either by manually loading the hub’s secret to
the device or to preload the APDs with some unique
secret. The preloaded secret of APDs can be made
known to the hub using an out-of-band (OOB) chan-
nel, e.g., the user enters the secret manually. How-
ever, many APDs such as smart bulbs, motion sensors,
smart key locks, etc., lack advanced interfaces for en-
tering or changing passwords. Moreover, it is a com-
mon occurrence that manufacturers opt to preload de-
vices with default keys that are easily leaked.
In fact,
the largest DDoS attack launched to date exploited de-
fault passwords preloaded to APDs–IP cameras, digital
video recorders, smart TVs–to recruit hundreds of thou-
sands of nodes into the Mirai botnet and attack the DNS
infrastructure [57].
On the other hand, a public key infrastructure (PKI) is
also impractical for wide deployments. This is because a
PKI typically requires a connection to a centralized cer-
tiﬁcation authority. For devices deployed on-the-ﬂy in
areas with intermittent Internet connectivity, reachback
to central certiﬁcate repositories may not be a robust op-
tion. Moreover, PKIs face signiﬁcant scalability, hetero-
geneity, and interoperability challenges. As an average
person or household owns an increasing number of de-
vices, the device association process must happen within
a short time and require very little or no human effort.
Also, a trust initialization protocol must be lightweight,
as APDs typically have low processing capability and are
energy constrained.

Several device pairing protocols have been proposed
for device pairing without pre-shared secrets [1,8,11,18,
26, 29, 32, 37, 40–42, 44, 54]. Most such protocols re-
quire an auxiliary secure out-of-band (OOB) channel, an
audio or visual channel for example, that is observable
by a user to aid the authentication of messages trans-
mitted over the public wireless channel. However, such
OOB channels introduce practical interoperability issues
due to the heterogeneity of the devices and are not user-
friendly. Recently, in-band pairing protocols [10, 17, 23]
have been proposed as an alternative to OOB pairing.
The former protocols only require that devices possess
a common wireless interface to communicate. Since the
wireless channel is known to be insecure in general, the
security of these protocols relies on the assumption that
wireless signal cancellation is infeasible, so that message
integrity and authentication properties can be derived by
encoding the messages in a special way. However, as
demonstrated by Popper et al. [47], this assumption may
not hold in many cases. Thus, it remains an open prob-
lem as to whether secure in-band device pairing proto-
cols can still be designed under a strong Dolev-Yao at-
tacker which can annihilate wireless signals.
In this paper, for the ﬁrst time, we seek an answer to
the above question. Instead of trying to prevent signal
cancellation attacks, we propose an approach to detect
the presence of an attacker who attempts to nullify the
signal at a receiver. Our core idea for verifying the in-
tegrity of a message m is to superimpose another signal
from a helper device (e.g., a smartphone) while m is be-
ing transmitted. Any cancellation attack on m is bound
to also cancel the superimposed signal from the helper.
The helper is assumed to have an existing trust associ-
ation with one of the devices in the network (e.g., the
hub), and is co-present with the primary device that is
authenticated by the hub. The superimposed signal is
later revealed by the helper via the authenticated chan-
nel, to allow for the recovery of m. Our protocol achieves
a strong “tamper-evidence” property where there are no
restrictions on what kind of signal manipulation the at-
tacker is allowed to do.
Speciﬁcally, the device’s message m is encoded with
ON-OFF keying and Manchester-coding. During the
transmission of m, the helper synchronously injects some
random signal at randomly selected slots. Any signal
nulliﬁcation attempt will cancel both the legitimate trans-
mitter’s and the helper’s signal, presuming that the activ-
ity periods for the helper are not easily discernible. The
helper later reveals its activity periods via an authenti-
cated channel to enable the hub in the detection of sig-
nal nulliﬁcation attempts. Trust between the hub and the
helper is established using traditional means (e.g., input
a shared random password on the smartphone when it is
ﬁrst paired with the hub), which is a one-time cost. With
only one helper in a network, we can securely introduce
many new devices at no extra hardware cost, thus ensur-
ing scalability and usability. Essentially, by exploiting
the co-presence of the helper with the new device(s), our
protocol transfers the trust from the helper to the new de-
vice(s).
The main contributions of this paper are four-fold:
• We construct a novel physical layer message in-
tegrity veriﬁcation primitive to detect signal cancel-
lation attacks over the wireless channel. We show
that our primitive achieves message integrity pro-
tection with only in-band communications.
• We utilize the proposed message integrity veriﬁ-
cation primitive to construct a secure in-band de-
vice pairing protocol named HELP based on the
Difﬁe-Hellman (DH) key agreement [14]. Whereas
the primitive provides one-way integrity veriﬁca-
tion (device-to-hub), we show that HELP achieves
two-way authenticated key agreement (counter-
intuitively). This is done via a novel way that ex-
ploits the helper’s superposed random signals to si-
multaneously protect both the integrity and conﬁ-
dentiality of the DH public parameters, such that
an adversary impersonating the hub cannot success-
fully establish a key with a legitimate device.
• We theoretically analyze the security of the pro-
posed integrity veriﬁcation primitive and the HELP
protocol, and we establish bounds for the adver-
sary’s success probability under active attacks (es-
pecially Man-in-the-Middle attacks). We show that
the adversary’s success probability is a negligible
function of the protocol parameters and thus can be
driven to an arbitrary small value.
• We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate the
effectiveness of the signal cancellation detection
mechanism and the pairing protocol. Our experi-
ments verify that device co-presence signiﬁcantly
hardens the adversary’s ability to distinguish be-
tween the helper’s and the legitimate device’s trans-
missions. We also implement the proposed protocol
in our Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)
testbed and evaluate the adversary’s successful pair-
ing probability with and without the protection of
our integrity veriﬁcation primitive. The experimen-
tal results are in line with our analytical ﬁndings.
The paper is organized as follows: we discuss related
work in Section 2. We state the system and threat models
in Section 3. We present the integrity veriﬁcation prim-
itive and the HELP pairing protocol in Section 4. The
security of the pairing primitive and of HELP are ana-
lyzed in Section 5. In Section 6, we study the adversary’s

capability in inferring the helper’s transmissions and in-
jecting modiﬁed messages by performing experiments on
the USRP platform. We further experimentally evaluate
the HELP assisted key-agreement protocol. We conclude
the paper in Section 7.
2 Related Work
In this section, we review previous works in trust estab-
lishment without prior associations, which involves both
message authentication and key-agreement.
It is well
known that key agreement can be achieved using tra-
ditional cryptographic protocols such as a DH key ex-
change [14]; however, public message exchange over
the wireless medium is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
(MitM) attacks, which are notoriously difﬁcult to thwart
without any prior security associations. To thwart MitM
attacks, additional message authentication and integrity
protection mechanisms are required. Therefore, next we
mainly review works in authentication/integrity protec-
tion without pre-shared secrets.
2.1 Out-of-Band Channel
proaches
based Ap-
Many existing secure device pairing methods rely on
some out-of-band (OOB) channel
to defend against
MitM attacks [1, 8, 11, 18, 26, 29, 32, 37, 40–42, 44, 54].
The OOB channel is assumed to possess certain secu-
rity properties (e.g., it is only accessible by the user),
which helps verify the integrity of messages transmit-
ted over the wireless channel. However, OOB chan-
nels usually require non-trivial human support and ad-
vanced user interfaces. For example, when a visual chan-
nel is used, a user needs to read a string from one de-
vice’s screen and input it into another [1, 11, 37], or vi-
sually compare multiple strings or LED ﬂashing patterns
[31, 32, 44]. Other works require specialized hardware
such as a Faraday cage to isolate the legitimate commu-
nication channel [27, 30]. On the other hand, biometric
signals [3,12,21,46,53,61,62,64] have been proposed to
create a secure channel through which nodes on the same
body can derive a shared secret. However, their applica-
tions are restricted to wearable devices, require uniform
sensing hardware, and are susceptible to remote biomet-
rics sensing attacks [20]. In addition, others have pro-
posed to exploit the shared physical context for authenti-
cation and key agreement. Examples of common modal-
ities include the accelerometer measurements when two
devices are shaken together [35, 36], or light and sound
for two devices located in the same room [38,52]. Again,
these require additional hardware and are not interopera-
ble, whereas in many cases the contextual source has low
entropy.
2.2 Non-cryptographic Device Authentica-
tion
As an alternative, non-cryptographic authentication tech-
niques usually derive trust from hard-to-forge physical-
layer characteristics unique to each device/link. They
usually transmit information “in-band” without requir-
ing an OOB channel. Existing approaches on non-
cryptographic device authentication [9, 25, 33, 45, 60, 65]
can be classiﬁed into three categories: (a) device proxim-
ity, (b) location distinction, and (c) device identiﬁcation.
In device proximity methods, the common idea is to ex-
ploit the channel reciprocity and its rapid decorrelation
(within a few wavelengths) with distance. However, such
techniques typically require advanced hardware which is
not suitable for constrained wireless devices. For ex-
ample, [9, 45, 65] require multiple-antennas, and [33]
needs a wide-band receiver. Moreover, these techniques
only address the common key extraction problem, leav-
ing them vulnerable to MitM attacks. Distance bound-
ing techniques [5, 49, 50] were also proposed to ensure
proximity, but they are not so practical yet (either resort
to OOB channels or specially designed hardware). Lo-
cation distinction methods such as temporal link signa-
tures that detect location differences [25, 43, 60] require
high bandwidth (> 40MHz), which is not always avail-
able to low-cost, resource-constrained devices. Finally,
device identiﬁcation techniques [6,13,16] distinguish de-
vices based on their unique physical-layer or hardware
features. Unfortunately, both location distinction and
device identiﬁcation techniques require prior training or
frequent retraining, which is not applicable to APDs ﬁrst
introduced to an environment.
2.3
In-Band Approaches for Message In-
tegrity Protection
Whereas the above approaches authenticate a device’s
presence, they do not necessarily protect the integrity of
the messages transmitted by a device, due to the possibil-
ity of signal manipulation attacks over the wireless chan-
nel [10]. There have been few past attempts to design
in-band message integrity protection mechanisms, which
assume that signal cancellation over the wireless chan-
nel is not possible [10, 23], or occurs with bounded suc-
cess [22]. For example, Tamper-Evident Pairing (TEP)
proposed by Gollakota et al.
in 2011 [17], and in-
tegrity codes (I-codes) proposed by ˇCapkun et al.
in
2008 [10] both assumed the infeasibility of signal can-
cellation. Based on message integrity, message authenti-
cation can be achieved by assuming the presence of the
legitimate device is known (a.k.a. authentication through
presence). However, the infeasibility of signal cancel-
lation assumption does not always hold. P¨opper et al.
USENIX Association
26th USENIX Security Symposium    435
demonstrated an effective relay signal cancellation attack
using a pair of directional antennas, which works regard-
less of the packet content and modulation [47]. Recently,
Hou et. al. [22] showed that it is possible to prevent sig-
nal cancellation only if the channel itself has enough ran-
domness. A typical indoor environment may not be suf-
ﬁcient because the devices are static and the channel is
usually stable.
To remedy the signiﬁcant shortcomings of existing de-
vice pairing schemes, we (for the ﬁrst time) introduce the
core idea of detecting signal manipulation attacks even if
