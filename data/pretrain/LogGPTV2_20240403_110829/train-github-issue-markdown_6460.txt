To my knowledge, Deno currently only supports fetching dependencies by downloading individual TypeScript or JavaScript files. This approach is not ideal for medium to large-scale projects that may have hundreds or even thousands of dependencies.

I propose that Deno should support fetching gzipped files and Git repositories to improve the dependency management process. For example, users could fetch a gzipped file containing a `mod.ts` in its root directory using a command like `deno fetch https://foo.gz`. Additionally, Deno could allow fetching from a Git repository with a command such as `deno fetch https://foo.git`, similar to how Go's `go get` works. These enhancements would make dependency management more efficient and scalable for larger projects.
