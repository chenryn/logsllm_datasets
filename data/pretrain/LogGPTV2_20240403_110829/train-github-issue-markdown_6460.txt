FWIK, Deno currently fetch dependencies only support download ts/js file(s)
individually, it's not a good idea for middle or even large project
dependencies fetch(hundreds of or even thounds of dependencies).  
So I think it's a good idea to support gzipped file through `deno fetch
https://foo.gz` which contains the mod.ts file in the root and (or) git repo
through `deno fetch https://foo.git` just like golang `go get`
