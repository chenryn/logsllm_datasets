  1. There are examples in the repo for loading a pre-trained model in C++. Can someone add an example to train a simple 1 hidden layer fully connected neural net (or even logistic regression using SGD) in C++?
  2. I realize there is no publicly available support for auto differentiation in C++. Are there any plans to do so?
