The commit `7e87eb1` removes the _format param being passed to
twig.controller.exception:showAction. No updates were made to the TwigBundle's
ExceptionController to account for this change and as such errors or
exceptions from non-html requests render incorrectly with the html templates.
One possible fix for this is to update the ExceptionController to rely on
$request->getRequestFormat() instead of the $_format argument being passed
around in the ExceptionController to its various methods.
