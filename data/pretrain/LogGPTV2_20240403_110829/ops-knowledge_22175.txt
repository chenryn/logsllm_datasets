User: Please explain how to regularly and automatically back up files in the Linux system and store them in a specified location.
Assistant: In the Linux system, you can use crontab to set up scheduled tasks, combined with the Linux backup command, you can automatically back up files and store them in a specified location. The specific operation steps are as follows: 1. Open the terminal, enter crontab -e to enter the scheduled task editing interface 2. Add the backup command to be executed in the editing interface, for example: ``` 0 1 * * * tar -zcvf /backup/backup. tar.gz /data ``` The above command means to perform a backup every day at 1 am, compress all files and subdirectories under the /data directory into a backup.tar.gz file, and store it in the /backup directory. 3. Save and exit the editing interface 4. To configure the time interval and running time of scheduled task execution, you can use the following commands: ``` * * * * * command-to-be-executed - - - - - | | | | | | | | | ----- Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday is both 0 and 7) | | | ------- Month (1 - 12) | | ----- --- Day of the month (1 - 31) | ----------- Hour (0 - 23) ------------- Minute (0 - 59) ` `` Parameter description: - `*` means to execute every time interval - `0` means to execute on the hour - `1` means to execute every time interval Runs automatically at startup. If you are not sure whether the daemon process has started, you can use the following command to start it manually: ``` systemctl start crond.service ``` After the above operations are completed, the Linux system will automatically perform a backup operation at the specified time, and store the backup file in the specified Location.
