Question: "Which of the following statements accurately reflect the consequences of enabling specific System Integrity Protection (SIP) settings on macOS devices?"
 "A": "Enabling sip1 may improve troubleshooting flexibility but could reduce security by allowing SSV volume root hash verification failures."
 "B": "Enabling sip2 increases security by preventing the kernel memory from being marked as non-writable, hence protecting against certain memory-based attacks."
 "C": "Enabling sip3 enhances security by allowing any boot-args from NVRAM to be passed to the kernel, increasing configuration options."
 "D": "Disabling sip2 may be necessary for certain diagnostic procedures, but it exposes the system to increased risk of memory integrity attacks."
