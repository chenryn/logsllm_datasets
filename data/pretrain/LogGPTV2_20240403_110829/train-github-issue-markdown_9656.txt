### System information
  * **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow)** :  
I used stock example script provided by TensorFlow to write my own custom
code.
  * **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)** :  
Windows 10 - Colab Notebook
  * **Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device** :  
N/A
  * **TensorFlow installed from (source or binary)** :  
Not sure
  * **TensorFlow version (use command below)** :  
1.9
  * **Python version** :  
3.6 (I think)
  * **Bazel version (if compiling from source)** :  
Unsure
  * **GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source)** :  
Unsure
  * **CUDA/cuDNN version** :  
N/A
  * **GPU model and memory** :  
N/A
  * **Exact command to reproduce** :
          # Train the CNN model
      mnist_classifier.train(input_fn=train_input_fn,steps=train_steps)
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
### Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in
TensorFlow or a feature request.
I want to train multiple CNNs of the same structure (lenet) using randomly
selected subsets of varying sizes from the MNIST training set. I was able to
use the same line of code successfully in an earlier program. This work is
contributing towards the development of a computational model for executive
function deficits in ADHD as part of a PhD thesis in Pharmaceutical Sciences.
### Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and
files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the
bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
