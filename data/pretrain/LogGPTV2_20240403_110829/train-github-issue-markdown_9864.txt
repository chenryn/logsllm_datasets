 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
feature
**What is the current behavior?**
Specifying output file names is not very flexible.
    {
        output: {
            filename: '[name].js'
        }
    }
**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing
the behavior?**
The current way of specifying output filenames is very limiting. I'm in a
situation where (for shitty legacy reasons), I need one of my entry points to
always output `[name].js`, but for all other entry points I want to use
`[name].min.js` in prod and `[name].js` in dev. I'm not aware of anyway to do
this without specifying two webpack configs. It would be great if
`output.filename` could accept either a function that is passed the bundle
info (`{ hash, name, ... }`) and returns a filename, or a map of entry name to
filename pattern.
#### function
    {
        output: {
            filename: (bundle) => {
                return `${bundle.name}-foo.js`;
            }
        }
    }
#### map
    {
        output: {
            filename: {
                entry1: '[name].js`,
                entry2: '[name].min.js`,
                entry3: '[name]-foo.min.js`
        }
    }
Adding something like this would also allow the use of kebab case names
without having to quote your entry names, along with opening up many other
opportunities.
    {
        entry: {
            'this-is-my-bundle-name': 'index.js', // meh
            thisIsMyBundleName: 'index.js`, // nice
        },
        output: {
            filename: (bundle) => {
                return `${_.kebabCase(bundle.name)}.js`;
            }
        }
    }
I'm happy to contribute if this idea is approved.
