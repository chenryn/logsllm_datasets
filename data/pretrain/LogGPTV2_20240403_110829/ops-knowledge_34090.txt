User: If I am on my host machine, I can kickoff a script inside a Docker container using:
docker exec my_container bash myscript.sh
However, let's say I want to run myscript.sh inside my_container from another container bob. If I run the command above while I'm in the shell of bob, it doesn't work (Docker isn't even installed in bob).
What's the best way to do this?
Assistant: Simply launch your container with something like
docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker ...
and it should do the trick
