### Environment
  * Dubbo version: 2.7.4-SNAPSHOT
  * Operating System version: macOS 10.14.5
  * Java version: 1.8.0_172
### Steps to reproduce this issue
I see there is LRU cache implement in dubbo, and LFU is also a useful cache
strategy. So, if it's necessary to impl LFU, I will try my best to work on it.
