### Analysis of Connection Durations

The connection durations for eDonkey and FastTrack are generally shorter compared to BitTorrent. BitTorrent connections tend to be longer and have higher throughput. The mean values of connection durations are provided in Table 2.

#### BitTorrent
In the case of BitTorrent, a peer distributing or downloading a file has a pool of 5 upload slots, meaning only 5 other peers can download the file from them. These slots are reallocated periodically to ensure fairness, but the TCP connections remain open. This results in idle times during transfers and long connection durations.

#### eDonkey
For eDonkey, a file is split into chunks. With the most popular eDonkey client (eMule), when a peer finishes downloading a chunk, it waits for another chunk in a queue, but the TCP connection between the peers stays open.

#### Statistical Fit
The difference in connection duration distributions between BitTorrent and eDonkey/FastTrack is confirmed by statistical analysis. A lognormal distribution fits eDonkey and FastTrack better, while BitTorrent's connection durations do not fit well with a classical distribution (as indicated by the K-S test).

### Traffic Pattern over Time

**3.4. Traffic Pattern over Time**

**Figure 5. eDonkey Traffic Volume and Number of Peers Over Time During a Weekday**

- **eDonkey:**
  - The overall traffic volume remains relatively stable throughout the day.
  - A small drop (about 20%) in transferred volumes is observed between 12 PM (midnight) and 9 AM, corresponding to a decrease in the number of active peers.
  - The upstream traffic is more stable than the downstream traffic, which is due to the nature of the peers involved. Permanently connected peers contribute to both upstream and downstream traffic, while other peers introduce more downstream traffic.

- **BitTorrent:**
  - The behavior is different. Connections are longer, and the receiver experiences many on and off times during the transfer, leading to a skewed traffic pattern.
  - One year ago, a clear time-of-day effect was observable, with 85% of the volume typically transferred between 3 PM and midnight in France. With the increase in BitTorrent users, the traffic pattern has become more regular over the day.
  - **Figure 6. BitTorrent Traffic Volume and Number of Peers Over Time During a Weekday**
    - From midnight to 5 PM, the number of peers and upstream volume are quite stable, but the downstream volume shows high fluctuations.
    - This is explained by the functioning system of BitTorrent, where the service capacity grows with the number of peers involved, resulting in a good response to flash crowds.
    - The two peaks in downstream volume likely result from a sudden increase in the number of distant BitTorrent peers, indicating that the files being downloaded are not very large.

- **FastTrack and WinMX:**
  - The traffic pattern is dynamic, with users mainly connecting between 12 PM (noon) and 12 AM (midnight) on weekdays and all day long on weekends.
  - This is due to high activity periods for ADSL (afternoons and evenings on weekdays) and the fact that users download shorter files with these applications.

- **Weekend Days:**
  - For eDonkey, the whole Saturday and Sunday morning are high activity periods, ending at noon on Sunday.
  - BitTorrent exhibits a similar pattern but with more erratic traffic distribution.

### Geographical Distribution of Peers

**3.5. Geographical Distribution of Peers**

We analyzed the destinations of transfers over a week using the IANA database description field.

- **eDonkey and BitTorrent:**
  - Most of the traffic (about 30%) is to and from France, followed by the U.S.
- **FastTrack and WinMX:**
  - The U.S. is the primary source and destination of transfers.

These distributions can vary based on weekly activity. For example, in June 2003, a majority of eDonkey traffic came from Germany.

### Termination of Connections

**3.6. Termination of Connections**

**Table 3. Distribution of the TCP-Flag of the Last Packet of Connections**

| Flag of Last Packet | eDonkey (%) | BitTorrent (%) | FastTrack (%) | WinMX (%) |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| NORMAL              | 20          | 9              | 15            | 20         |
| SYN                 | 21          | 42             | 39            | 27         |
| FIN                 | 6           | 5              | 4             | 5          |
| PUSH                | 20          | 16             | 5             | 17         |
| RESET               | 7           | 11             | 11            | 9          |
| OTHER               | 23          | 16             | 25            | 20         |

- **Analysis:**
  - Only a few connections end normally (four-way handshake).
  - Many connections end with a RESET packet, indicating a P2P client disconnecting from the network.
  - A high percentage of connections end abnormally, e.g., with a PUSH flag.
  - 20 to 40% of connections are only connection attempts (last packet is a SYN). These peers receive connection requests even though they are no longer connected to the P2P network.

### Connectivity of Peers

**4. Connectivity of Peers**

**4.1. Local Peer Connectivity**

**Figure 7. Number of Different IP Addresses Connected to a Local User**

- **eDonkey:**
  - Higher connectivity; 18% of local eDonkey peers contact a single peer, and almost 50% contact more than 10 other peers.
  - Some eDonkey peers connect to more than 100,000 other peers, indicating the presence of indexing servers among local peers.
- **BitTorrent:**
  - Downloading traffic has higher connectivity than signaling traffic due to the information management by a single tracker per file and downloads from multiple sources.

**4.2. Distant Peer Connectivity**

- **Distant Peer Connectivity:**
  - Few local peers are connected to the same distant peer, with no significant accumulation of connections on a distant IP address.
  - eDonkey peers have the densest connectivity, with 20% of distant peers being contacted by more than three local peers.
  - For other protocols, about 80% of distant peers are contacted only once by local peers.

### Highly Connected Peers

- **eDonkey Peers:**
  - About 130 peers connect to more than 10,000 other peers daily.
  - These peers have similar mean connection sizes but transfer larger volumes (500 MB downstream and 340 MB upstream per peer).

### Conclusion

**5. Conclusion**

This paper compares the performance and characteristics of four P2P applications. Our methodology allows for a deep analysis of traffic traces from all users in a regional ADSL area. Key findings include:

- Most P2P connections are short and represent small volumes.
- A few users contribute significantly to the total traffic volume.
- Users tend to download more than they upload.
- Local peers contact many different distant peers.
- Unsuccessful connection attempts represent a significant portion of connections.

Our persistent measurements have revealed changes in P2P application popularity and shifts in the location of sources over a year.
