High Volume NXD Base Domains Are Pretty Rare...
• We go from 1.8 million NXDOMAINS/hour in the case of 
spamhaus.org, all the way down to less than 75,000/hour in one 
slide's worth of domains. 
• The drop off gets even faster after that. See the graph on the next 
slide, and note the log-linear axes...
• Within 179 unique effective 2nd level domains, you're down to 
only 10,000 NXDOMAINS/hour
• Within 1,977 unique effective 2nd level domains, you're down to 
1,000 NXDOMAINS/hour
• Within 34,025 unique effective 2nd level domains, you're down to 
100 NXDOMAINS/hour
• That shows that "high volume" NXDOMAINS are pretty tightly 
distributed – there aren't a lot of them. Most 2nd level effective 
domains only attract a comparative handful of NXDOMAINs/hr

Maybe All The "Good NXDOMAINS" Are Already Gone?
• If domainers have already been watching DNS traffic, as we 
hypothesized, we wouldn't EXPECT to see lots of really juicy 
"typo bait" left just waiting to be registered – it presumably 
would have already been noticed and monetized
• However, have we just managed to find a way to identify DGA 
domains? Is much of the higher volume NXDOMAIN traffic 
actually BOT-related?
• Rhetorical question: Should we register and sinkhole these and 
see what hosts check in over time?
33
Could You Make A Living As A Domainer Off "Crumbs?"
• Many of the highest volume NXDOMAIN-generating domains 
appear to be already be registered or impossible to register.
• However, could you cover your costs and make a profit by 
registering lots of lower-popularity domains? 
• Potentially, but it's not my intent to encourage domaining. We'll 
let the domainer's figure that out based on what they can figure 
out a way to see...

High Value Brands Seen
In NXDOMAIN Traffic
"Recon By Fire"
• Remember that we also suggested that some popular brands 
might be targeted for "recon by fire", or probes for unregistered 
variants of popular names. 
• Given our limited time, let's just consider one example where 
NXDOMAINS may still be interesting to security people, as a 
heads up about what may be coming, or what might make 
sense to target for a defensive domain name registration.
• Let's look for domains related to the substring "payp"

Some of Those Domains Might Be Innocent
• I'd be willing to bet, however, that some of those domains are 
NOT innocent, and you will be seeing them again, under unsavory 
circumstances.
• Wouldn't you rather know about then in advance?
• You should be watching NXDOMAIN traffic!
• Are there other security-related reasons why you should be 
watching NXDOMAINs?
• Yes: it might help you spot DDoS attacks.

Surprising To See .rs, .co, and .il As The Top TLDs
• Generally speaking, we'd not expect those particular ccTLDs to be 
the top TLDs seen in the NXDOMAINs channel (and by a 
substantial margin at that).
• Farsight does not disclose the geographical distribution of its 
global sensors, however we can say that there is not a particularly 
dense deployment of sensors in Serbia, Colombia or Israel that 
might account for this sort of skewed domain distribution.
• Closer inspection of the traffic makes it clear that this is likely not 
organic traffic primarily associated with end-user errors; 
potentially that traffic looks like DDoS-related to us...
42
Examples of Some Unusual .rs Domains We Saw
Vast majority of our .rs domains were seen only once, and looked like...
201ny42yvx5kvlmiviejxqgrtdei1fmrvmbrmcgfrcwwrtrrdcciim5bcw.rs
201nze3wjyt1h28hvakzssd9h5yib7edvaj5px7koxidc560knocpcbngxpap.rs
201oqdcegyhfr8jlaegdan8d0ytaiim1rgjnakrljqsybjggnicmeduhdmb5wow.rs
201phnf8wqgx2pj2zyr8tziamogejkxkcq4jikqrlxulqptzewevge9zio6lgln.rs                  
[etc]
or
20160224104304.rs.
20160224104446.rs.
20160224104659.rs.
20160224104453.rs.
[etc]
43
Can We Tell Who's Being Targeted by That Traffic?
• Because we collect above the recursive resolver, as a general rule, 
you cannot see an individual end-user's system's IP address. You 
cam, however, see the large recursive resolvers that may be 
answering on his or her behalf as an apparent query source.
• In this case, however, the condensed format that SIE 
NXDOMAINS employs does not include the apparent query 
source, so you can't localize this potential attack traffic even to the 
large recursive resolver contributing the data.
• The recursive resolver seen making the query IS available in 
another SIE Channel, Channel 220, "DNS Errors," however our 
terms of service preclude you from bothering (or disclosing the 
apparent identify of) our sensor operators.
44
Conclusion
Key Takeaways
1) NXDOMAINS may not be particularly fruitful for frontrunners 
(must admit, that doesn't exactly make me sad...)
2) However, we did find out that NXDOMAINs may be terrific when 
it comes to finding:
– Potentially-suspicious DGA-related domains
– Domains potentially involved in distributed denial of service 
attacks, and
– Potential phishing or mark-infringing sites being reconnoitered 
prior to an attack
3)
You should be paying attention to domains that don't resolve
4)
You can probably build far better tools to grind NXDOMAINs 
data – maybe you'd like to give it a try?
