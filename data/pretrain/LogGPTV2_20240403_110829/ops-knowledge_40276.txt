User: I installed both Python 2.7 and Python 2.6.5. I don't know what went wrong, but nothing related to Python seems to work any more. e.g. "setup.py install" for certain packages don't recognize the "install" parameter and other odd phenomena...
I would like to completely remove Python from my system.
I tried running the 2.7 and 2.6 msi files and choosing remove Python and then running only 2.6 and reinstalling it. Still stuff don't work.
How do I completely remove Python - from everything? (!)
I would not like to reinstall my entire machine just because of the Python install...
Assistant: Here's the steps (my non-computer-savvy girlfriend had to figure this one out for me, but unlike all the far more complicated processes one can find online, this one works)

Open Control Panel
Click "Uninstall a Program"
Scroll down to Python and click uninstall for each version you don't want anymore.

This works on Windows 7 out of the box, no additional programs or scripts required.
