  * Would you like to work on a fix?
### How are you using Babel?
Other (Next.js, Gatsby, vue-cli, ...)
### Input code
Code that reproduces the crash (only happens when targeting older engines like
`IE 11`:
    main();
    async function main() {
      let is_done = false;
      const async_iterable = {
        [Symbol.asyncIterator]: () => ({
          next: () => {
            const promise = Promise.resolve({ value: "luv u", done: is_done });
            is_done = true;
            return promise;
          },
        }),
      };
      (async () => { // IIFE: required for babel to crash
        for await (const string of async_iterable) { // for await: required for babel to crash
          console.log(string);
        }
      })();
      const [one] = [1]; // array destructuring: required for babel to crash
    }
REPL link that also crashes
### Configuration file name
babel.config.js
### Configuration
Not relevant IMO since it also crashes in REPL. Target has to be set to `IE
11`.
### Current and expected behavior
Current behavior: `Property name expected type of string but got null`
Expected behavior: Code that prints `luv u` to the console when ran.
### Environment
  * Babel: 7.15.7 (@babel/core 7.15.5)
  * Node v16.9.1
  * Yarn 3.0.2
  * OS: macOS 10.15.7 (19H1323)
### Possible solution
Transpile the code correctly instead of crashing
### Additional context
I wrote code which was the reproduction code but with many more steps. Wanted
to push it to a customer as a quick fix before my next calendar event. Babel
crashed. Suck. Deployed only for modern browsers. Bored, offline on a flight I
removed code bit for bit for bit for bit until I came up with the reproduction
snippet. This is a very weird bug.
