**Abstract:**
Evaluating the complexity of business processes during their early development stages, particularly during the process modeling phase, provides organizations and stakeholders with models that are easy to understand and maintain. This is advantageous for performing evolution tasks in process models, which are critical in today's competitive market. In this work, we present the use and validation of the CFC (Control-Flow Complexity) metric to evaluate the complexity of business process models developed using BPMN. The complexity is assessed from a control-flow perspective. An empirical evaluation was conducted to demonstrate the utility of the CFC metric when applied to BPMN models, providing insights into their maintainability.

**Keywords:**

### 1. Introduction
Business process modeling is the initial step towards achieving organizational goals. Its importance lies not only in describing the process but also in serving as a preparatory phase for activities such as business process improvement, reengineering, technology transfer, and standardization [1].

In these activities, business process models are managed by various stakeholders, including business process analysts, domain experts, technical analysts, and software developers. Therefore, one of the primary purposes of these models is to facilitate communication among stakeholders. To achieve this, the models should be easy to understand and maintain. High complexity in a process can lead to poor understandability, errors, defects, and exceptions, increasing the time required for development, testing, and maintenance. Recognizing and measuring complexity is the first step towards reducing it.

In this context, Cardoso [2] defines process complexity as the degree to which processes are difficult to analyze, understand, or explain. He introduces the CFC metric for analyzing the control-flow complexity of business processes. Previous works [3, 4, 5] have defined and empirically validated a set of measures for evaluating BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) models [6]. These measures are based on the structural properties of the models and have been correlated with usability and maintainability. Given that both sets of measures are based on the analysis of model complexity, it is important to examine the influence of the CFC metric on the complexity of BPMN models from a control-flow perspective.

This paper presents the analysis and empirical validation of the CFC metric's influence on the usability and maintainability of BPMN models. The validation uses data from two families of experiments previously conducted to validate measures of structural complexity in BPMN models [5].

### 2. Related Work
The complexity and other characteristics of business process models (BPMs), such as size, density, cohesion, and coupling, have been analyzed and measured by researchers. They agree that, similar to software processes, business processes should minimize complexity to provide adequate support to stakeholders. Most measures proposed for analyzing BPMs are adaptations of metrics used for software evaluation. For instance, works like [7, 8, 9, 10] compare software complexity metrics with corresponding metrics for BPMs.

Different perspectives have been adopted to evaluate the complexity of business processes. Gruhn and Laue [11] use cognitive weights to measure the difficulty of understanding BPM elements. Mendling [12] investigates how model complexity influences errors in BPMs, developing metrics to predict error probabilities and testing 28 business process metrics on over 2000 process models [13, 14].

McCabe’s cyclomatic complexity ideas are borrowed in [7] to define the CFC metric, which analyzes business process complexity from a workflow perspective. Empirical validation of these measures is limited. A recent study [15] analyzed the use of BPMN elements in practice and their implications.

In this context, we use the CFC metric defined by Cardoso to evaluate the control-flow complexity of BPMs developed with BPMN. Both [2, 3] extend and adapt software process metrics to business processes, emphasizing that understanding process model complexity facilitates easier modification and maintenance.

### 3. Control-Flow Complexity Measure
Effective process management requires the analysis of process complexity. The CFC metric aims to capture the control-flow behavior of a process, influenced by constructs such as splits and joins.

#### 3.1 Definition of CFC Metric
- **XOR-split Control-Flow Complexity:** Determined by the number of mental states introduced by the split. The function CFC(a) computes the control-flow complexity of the XOR-split a. For XOR-splits, the complexity is the fan-out of the split.
  \[ \text{CFC}(a) = \text{fan-out}(a) \]

- **OR-split Control-Flow Complexity:** Determined by the number of mental states introduced by the split. For OR-splits, the complexity is \(2^{(\text{fan-out}(a) - 1)}\).
  \[ \text{CFC}(a) = 2^{\text{fan-out}(a) - 1} \]

- **AND-split Control-Flow Complexity:** For AND-splits, the complexity is 1, as the designer needs to consider only one state arising from the execution of the construct.
  \[ \text{CFC}(a) = 1 \]

Mathematically, the CFC metric is additive:
\[ \text{CFC} = \sum \text{CFC}_{\text{XOR-split}} + \sum \text{CFC}_{\text{OR-split}} + \sum \text{CFC}_{\text{AND-split}} \]

A higher CFC value indicates greater overall structural complexity. CFC analysis evaluates complexity without direct process execution.

#### 3.2 Example of CFC Calculation
Figure 1 shows an online ticket purchase process modeled with BPMN. The customer must choose between different paths after initiating the process. The process ends when the purchase is completed or canceled. Table 1 shows the CFC values calculated for the process in Figure 1.

**Figure 1. Online Ticket Purchase Process**

**Table 1. CFC Metrics for the Process in Figure 1**

| CFC Metric                     | Value |
|--------------------------------|-------|
| CFC (tickets type?)            | 4     |
| CFC (shows offer type?)        | 4     |
| CFC (to select theatre type)   | 5     |
| CFC (offer data correct?)      | 2     |
| CFC (theatre data correct?)    | 2     |
| CFC (wants to see record?)     | 2     |
| CFC (wants to buy?)            | 2     |
| CFC (wants continue the purchase?) | 2 |
| CFC (payment’ problems?)       | 2     |
| CFC (to select province/park)  | 2^(2-1) |
| CFC (to access the web)        | 1     |
| CFC (to select theatre type)   | 1     |
| CFC (to select offer type)     | 1     |
| CFC (Purchase on-line)         | 31    |

This example demonstrates that CFC metrics can effectively measure the complexity of BPMN models, fulfilling the objective of analyzing control-flow complexity.

### 4. Measures for BPMN Models
Our work involves analyzing and empirically validating the CFC metric based on previous studies of BPMN models. This section summarizes the previous work to contextualize the results presented in this paper.

Previous research defined a set of measures for BPMN models, categorized into Base Measures and Derived Measures. Table 2 shows some derived measures (the complete list is available in [3]).
