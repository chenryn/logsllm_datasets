Abstract. Evaluating the complexity of business processes during the early
stages of their development, primarily during the process modelling phase,
provides organizations and stakeholder with process models which are easy to
understand and easy to maintain. This presents advantages when carrying out
evolution tasks in the process models - key activities, given the current
competitive market. In this work, we present the use and validation of the CFC
metric to evaluate the complexity of business process models developed with
BPMN. The complexity is evaluated from a control-flow perspective. An
empirical evaluation has been carried out, in order to demonstrate that the CFC
metric can be useful when applied to BPMN models, providing information
about their ease of maintenance.
Keywords. Business process models, BPMN, Measurement, Validation.
1 Introduction
Business process modeling is the first step towards the achievement of organizational
goals, because its importance resides not only in the description of the process, but in
that it also usually represents a preparatory phase for activities such as business
process improvement, business process reengineering, technology transfer and
process standardization [1].
But in all these activities the business process models are managed by different
stakeholders (business process analysts, domain experts, technical analysts, software
developers, among others). Therefore, one of their main purposes is support
communication between the stakeholders and to fulfill this purpose, the business
process models should be easy to understand and easy to maintain. High complexity
in a process has several undesirable drawbacks: it may result in bad understandability,
as well as in errors, defects, and exceptions, thus leading to the need for more time to
develop, test and maintain the processes. That being so, the first step towards
reducing complexity is to recognise its existence, and then measure it.
In this context, Cardoso [2] defines process complexity as the degree to which
processes are difficult to analyze, understand or explain. He defines the Control-Flow
Complexity (CFC) metric for analyzing the degree of complexity of business process.
On the other hand, in previous works [3, 4, 5] a set of measures for the evaluation
of models developed with BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) [6] have
been defined and empirically validated. They are based on the measurement of
structural properties of these models. As a result of the empirical validation, several
measures were correlated with usability and maintainability. However, we believe
that since the measures proposed in both works are based on the analysis of the
complexity of the models of business processes, it would be important to analyze the
influence of CFC metric in the complexity of BPMN models from a control-flow
perspective.
On this basis in this paper the analysis and empirical validation of the influence of
CFC metric on usability and maintainability of BPMN models is presented. This is
done by using the data obtained from two families of experiments which were carried
out earlier to validate measures of structural complexity of BPMN models [5].
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of related
works and Section 3 introduces the CFC metric, presenting an example of
computation in a business process model with BPMN. Section 4 provides an overview
of the two families of experiments carried out to empirically validate measures for
BPMN process models. Section 5 presents the analysis of results in the validation of
the CFC metric, using the data obtained from the experiments with the BPMN
models. Finally, conclusions are outlined in Section 6.
2 Related Work
The complexity and other characteristics and aspects of business processes models
(BPMs) such as size, density, cohesion, coupling (among others) have been analyzed
and measured by some researchers who agree that, as with software processes,
business processes should minimize their complexity, so that they provide adequate
support to the various stakeholders. The majority of measures proposed for analyzing
the complexity of BPMs, have their origin in, or are adaptations of, measures
previously defined for the evaluation of software. For instance, in works such as [7, 8,
9, 10] this topic is analyzed and software complexity metrics (or others characteristics
of software) are analyzed and compared with corresponding metrics for BPMs.
However, it is important to highlight the different perspectives from which the
complexity of business process has been evaluated. For instance, Gruhn and Laue
[11] has adopted complexity measures based on cognitive weights, assuming that
these are good ways of measuring the difficulty of understanding the BPMs elements.
Mendling, in [12], investigates how the complexity of models influences errors
observed in a wide range of existing BPMs, developing a set of metrics to measure
the probability of error and testing 28 business process metrics as error predictors on a
set of over 2000 process models from different samples [13, 14].
In [7] , some ideas from McCabe’s cyclomatic complexity are borrows and CFC
metric are defined, which can be used to analyze the complexity of business processes
from a work-flow perspective (see section 3). Moreover, there is not much published
work about empirical validation of the measures proposed. In a recent study, the use
of BPMN elements in practice and their implications were analyzed [15].
In this context we use the CFC metric defined by Cardoso to evaluate the control-
flow complexity of several BPMs developed with BPMN standard notation [6]. In this
context, both works presented in [2, 3] coincide in the study of the metrics defined for
software processes and their extension and adaptation to business processes, on the
basis of the similarity that is present at the time of evaluating their complexity. In
addition, both share the idea that when information with regard to process model
complexity is obtained, the model is easier to understand and modify in order to
perform maintenance tasks and process quality improvement is more likely to occur.
3 Control-Flow Complexity Measure
An important aspect to consider in the quest to achieve effective process management
is the complexity analysis of processes. This is the aim of the CFC metric, whose
definition is based on the hypotheses that the control-flow behaviour of a process is
affected by constructs such as splits and joins.
As a result, the formula developed captures the complexity of the XOR-split, OR-
split, and AND-split constructs as follows:
• XOR-split Control-flow Complexity. Determined by the number of mental states
that are introduced with this type of split. The function CFC (a), where a is
XOR-split
an activity, computes the control-flow complexity of the XOR-split a. For XOR-
splits, the control-flow complexity is simply the fan-out of the split.
CFC (a)= fan-out(a) (1)
XOR-split
• OR-split Control-flow Complexity. Determined by the number of mental states that
are introduced with the split. For OR-splits, the control-flow complexity is 2^(n-1),
where n is the fan-out of the split.
CFC (a)= 2fan-out(a)-1 (2)
OR-split
• AND-split Control-flow Complexity. For an AND-split, the complexity is simply
1. The process designer needs only to consider and analyze one state that may arise
from the execution of an AND-split construct, since it is assumed that all the
outgoing transitions are selected and followed.
CFC (a)= 1 (3)
AND-split
Mathematically, the Control-Flow Complexity metric is additive. This is done by
simply adding the CFC of all the split constructs and is calculated as follows:
CFC = ∑CFC (a) + ∑CFC (a) + ∑CFC (a) (4)
XOR-split OR-split AND-split
The greater the value of the CFC, the greater the overall structural complexity of a
process will be. CFC analysis seeks to evaluate complexity without direct execution
of processes.
3.1 Example of CFC Calculation
Figure 1 shows the process of online ticket purchase modelled with BPMN. This
process states that the customer has to choose between different outgoing paths once
the process is initiated. Basically, it consists of selecting the type of tickets that is
being sought on the Web, and for each option there are diverse outgoing paths. The
process finishes when the purchase is carried out satisfactorily or when the customer
cancels the purchase process. As example, the results of the Control-Flow Complexity
calculation carried out in the process of Figure 1 are shown in Table 1.

The calculation of the overall CFC value basically consists of adding the individual
CFC of each split. The value obtained gives an indication of the complexity of the
ticket purchase process. It would, however, be important to have a parameter or rank
of values with which we could decide whether or not the resulting value represents a
greater degree of the complexity of the model.

With this example, it has been possible to verify that CFC metrics can be used to
measure the complexity of BPMN models, fulfilling their objective of analyzing the
control-flow complexity of business processes.
4 Measures for BPMN Models
Our work consists of analyzing and empirically validating the CFC metric on the
basis of previous work carried out for the evaluation of models developed with
BPMN. Hence, in this section a summary of the previous works is included to place
the results presented in this paper into context.
With the aim to evaluate the complexity of business processes by starting from the
model which represents them at a conceptual level, in previous work a set of measures
were defined in which can be grouped into two categories: Base Measures and
Derived Measures. Table 2 shows an example of some derived measures (the
complete list of measures can be found in [3]).
