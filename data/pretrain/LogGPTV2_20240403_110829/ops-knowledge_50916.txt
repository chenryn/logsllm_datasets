I have a rather nuanced question that has been bothering me for some time. I appreciate the simplicity of the IDLE scripting interface, but I frequently encounter crashes under very specific circumstances: (1) when I am coding on an external monitor, and (2) when I type the parenthesis button, "(". This issue only arises in this exact situation; otherwise, IDLE runs smoothly.

Interestingly, if I connect an external monitor but keep the IDLE development window on my laptop's main screen, I experience no crashes at all. This has resulted in the loss of a significant amount of code.

My setup includes:
- Mac OS X Version 10.11.3
- MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

**Update:**

I have discovered a solution that does not require changing any monitor settings. In IDLE, follow these steps:
1. Go to the **Options** menu.
2. Select **Configure Extensions**.
3. Set **CallTips** to **FALSE**.
4. Restart IDLE.

This fix was found after extensive research. The problem is not due to an error in IDLE itself, but rather an issue with the Mac's Tcl/Tk code when call tips are displayed on external monitors above the default monitor.
