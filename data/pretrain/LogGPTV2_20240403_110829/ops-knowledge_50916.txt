User: Ok, I realize this may be an extremely nuanced question, but it has been bugging me for a while.  I like the simple scripting interface of IDLE, but it keeps crashing on me when: (1) I am coding on an external monitor and (2) I type the parenthesis button, "(". IDLE never crashes for me for any other reason than this very specific situation.  Strangely, if I have an external monitor connected, but I have the IDLE dev window on my laptop's main screen, I have ZERO problems with crashing. (???) I have lost a substantial amount of code due to this problem.
I am running on Mac OSX Version 10.11.3 and I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)  Any thoughts would be appreciated!
Assistant: I found a fix! One that doesn't require changing monitor settings.
In IDLE:
Options Menu > Configure Extensions > CallTips > set to FALSE
Then restart.
Took much research to find that super simple solution... the problem is caused not by an error in IDLE but by an error in the mac's Tcl/Tk code when calltips are called in external monitors above the default monitor.
