Who Am I What Do I Do What's the Talk 
About,
• About Me: Speaker at Defcon 22 Tons of Computer Certs, Computer Science/Geophysics
• About 11 years pen-testing, security research , Spoke at Defcon 22 Las Vegas on 
Burnerphone DDOS
• NERC, FFIEC, FISMA/NIST, ISO, GLBA and FDIC, Compliance audits HIPAA, Omnibus, 
• Wrote custom exploits for obscure Internet service provider gear and PMS software.
• Tools of the trade “Fleet of Fake I phones” And now android variance.
• Co-writer of Skimbad Software Open source anti malware skimming software OPEN 
SOURCE. This talk today will be going of this new concept of protecting Data
• Pentesting for a living everything from banks, hospitals and ISP in the Mid-west. I live and 
work in North Dakota
• Security projects including Reverse engineering of malware and tracking software. 
Working on 911 Attack mitigation projects. 
TEENSY 3.1 Container!!!
Build Your Own There Awesome !!!
Hit me up on Twitter or E-mail me.
START THE DEMO !!!
• This will Run while I speak
• We will check the number at the end of the Presentation
• The Graphical demonstration version is available on Skimbad.com
• Source Code and EXE are Available on GitHub 
The problem of Data skimming malware/  Large 
Profile cases
Why do people skim data / how much does it cost
Why do people skim data / how much does it cost
how its sold/used to defraud
how its sold/used to defraud
• Carding/ Ordering things online 
• Duplicating cards and using them in 
stores.
• ATM Cashout runs / Pin Skimmed 
Data.
• Theft of resources / Gas Food.
• Theft of online services or Licenced
materials / Digital Movies 
/subscriptions to sites.
• Using Card data to transfer money 
WU runs.
How batches of data are ex-filtrated and sold
How batches of data are ex-filtrated and sold
• USB devices used to jump “Air” gapped or tighter security 
• Use if spearfishing campaigns 
• Software is loaded on to systems by classic hacking methods USB, HID.
• Batches are pull to servers most of the time using POST requests every time a 
card is found in memory the malware sends the data to a Dump
• Dumps are complied by BIN number and sold on carding pages price is 
determined by the banks usual Point of Sale and Debit limit. 
• The validity rate is how many cards out of a 100 will work . Most batches sold on 
proper carding forums are 98% plus 
• Two year old Target breach still has about a 10% validity Rate.
Initial POS terminal is breached and malware is loaded
As cards are swiped they now are send to a Server where they will 
be sold online.
For the demonstration this all will be ran on one computer normally 
the POS is separate from the card catching Server.
How does malware tell credit card data from other data 
Most Search Memory Using Custom Search Algorithms
Other uses EX. Malware research 
II. The approach to stopping Breaches / the tool
what currently exists to stop skimming/data exfiltration
how this concept would make batches unusable
how are random credit cards made what are Bins
How random card numbers are made
How it makes random names.
Honeypot card numbers to let them know breach has 
occurred. 
Anti-keystroke Catching
III. How will malware evolve and how we will 
stay on top of it
Malware gets smarter and detects BINs from area 
and other methods 
watch dog portions (protection from malware)
How to make batches look real
The Legitimate Credit Cards are Covered with Fakes
How to make fake batches (unscrubable no 
reversing of process) 
Will Chip/Pin stop skimming ?
Software is Open Source Free 
Help make it better
There is no reason that this 
concept should not be built 
into every POS system
Conclusions:
Thanks for Listening
Questions Concerns?
Special Thanks to: Tim Swartz, My Family, My 
Work Defcon Crew for approving my topic.
