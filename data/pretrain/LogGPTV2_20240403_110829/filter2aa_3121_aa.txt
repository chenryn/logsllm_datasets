Not anymore, I spent my dues on 
something useful, car parts.
• I’m just a geek who loves technology, cars, 
and hacks

forums, open source software, sweat, and 
bloody knuckles
• Thanks to Intrepidus
Group

Tools of the trade
ECU  ‐
Engine Control Unit
• The brain – just another 
computer
• Controls Fuel Injection
• Controls Ignition timing
• Programmable
Methods of altering the code
• Replacement ECUs
• EPROM chips
• Piggy Back ECUs
• ECU re‐flashing
Replacement ECUs
• Standalone units 
completely replace the 
factory ECU
• Upside
– Enhanced features
– Quick edits
• Downside
– No ODBII
– Costly
EPROM Chips
• Early “Chip”
tuning was 
exactly that
• Upside
– Can alter the operation of 
older ECUs
• Downside
– Slower
– Set‐and‐forget, soldering, 
etc..
Piggy Back ECUs
• Think Man‐In‐The‐
Middle attack
• Upside
– Fast to market
– Extra features
– Quick Edits
• Downside
– Costly
– Increased 
complexity
ECU Re‐flashing
• Thank you ODBII
– Every car, 1996 
and up
– Primarily for data 
acquisition and 
troubleshooting
– Also used for 
“firmware”
updates
Continued on next page…
Continued: ECU Re‐flashing
• The ECU is a  computer 
loaded with software
– ECUs
occasionally have 
bugs
– nhtsa.dot.gov
TSBs
– Auto manufacturers fix 
these with a re‐flash, often 
times through the ODBII 
port
Continued on next page…
Continued: ECU Re‐flashing
• The auto manufactures don’t publish their re‐
flashing protocols. 
• They don’t publish ECU code
• $$$ Big business for reverse engineers
– Would you pay $1000 dollars for a PSP firmware 
update?
Continued on next page…
Continued: ECU Re‐flashing
• Overview of how it’s done
– Step one, crack the re‐
flashing protocol
– Step two download the 
ECU code
– Step three map out ECU
– Step four edit and re‐flash
– Step five pray you didn’t 
brick your ECU
(or do something that will 
blow up you car…)

• ^ Will that make 
your car faster?
• Or will your air 
bags deploy when  
you honk the horn?  
Continued: ECU Re‐flashing
• $$$ Big Business
– A lot of R&D is required
– Expensive equipment
– Anti‐Piracy methods
• Special code – DRM?
• Hardware tokens etc..
• Lawyers

Continued: ECU Re‐flashing
• Then: take you car to a 
“tuner”
who licensed the 
software
– They charge you for the 
license and tuning fees
• Now: The industry is moving 
to more DIY applications
– Portable re‐flashers
– Laptop and PDA based
Continued on next page…
Continued: ECU Re‐flashing
• Portable tuners
– Usually have preset 
settings or “stages”
• Increase performance
• Change shift points
• Account for larger 
wheels
• Security features to tie 
the device to only one 
vehicle
• Pricing $400‐$1000

Continued: ECU Re‐flashing
• Laptop based tuners
– Usually have preset 
settings or “stages”
– Typically give the end 
user  more control
• Increase performance
• Also have anti‐copy 
features $$$

Continued: ECU Re‐flashing
• Laptop based tuners
– More control
– Performance “Stages”
– Highly customizable

You can do a lot…

• 330 ft/lbs 
torque
• Brochure says 
400 hp
• ~23% drive train 
loss
• Wheel horse 
power
• Drive train loss
• Every dyno

What's a Dyno? (dynamometer)
• A tool to place load on 
the engine to measure 
power

• 242 ft/lbs 
torque
• Brochure 
says 300 hp
• ~25% drive 
train loss
After ECU tuning
• …and some 
parts

Introduction to performance tuning
• We cant be experts in 75 minutes, but we can 
cover the fundamentals….
Electronic Fuel Injection
• Topics for performance tuning 
– Protocols
– Important EFI sensors
– Fuel, Spark, and Air
– Boost
– Data Acquisition
Continued on next page…
EFI Performance tuning
Important sensors
• Oxygen sensors (O2 sensors)
• Mass Air Flow (MAF)
• Manifold Absolute Pressure 
(MAP)
• Intake Air Temperature (IAT)
• Throttle position sensor (TPS)
• Coolant temperature
• Knock
sensor
Continued on next page…
EFI Performance tuning: Fuel
• The ECU has to cope with 
different grades and quality of 
fuel
• It processes data from the 
different sensors
• Based on information it gets from 
MAF, MAP, and O2 sensors, it 
determines an injector duty cycle 
needed to reach a desired air fuel 
ratio (AFR)
Continued on next page…
EFI Performance tuning: Fuel
• A perfectly mixed batch of fuel and 
air for total combustion is ~14.7 
parts air to 1 part fuel
• This is called stoichiometric
– Apologies to the lambda folks
– 14.7:1 ARF is also known as 1 lambda
• Most engines makes the best power 
running AFRs
between 12.2:1 and 
12.8:1
• More on octane later…
Continued on next page…
EFI Performance tuning: Fuel
• An air fuel mixture is 
ignited
• Exhaust gases are 
measured for oxygen
• The ECU makes 
adjustments to reach its 
programmed AFR values
Continued on next page…
EFI Performance tuning: Fuel
• Auto manufactures have many factors to cope with 
when programming the desired air fuel ratios for:
– Safety and engine longevity
– Fuel economy
– Emissions control
– Altitude and fuel octane ratings
• Different parts of the world have different grades of fuel
• For instance premium octane in California is only 91 octane
• Because the AFRs
account for a wide variety of 
conditions they are not optimized for max horsepower
Continued on next page…
EFI Performance tuning: Spark
• The right mix of fuel needs to be ignited 
at the right time
• TDC – Top Dead Center
– The highest point a piston can reach
• Spark Advance
– Adjusting the timing to fire the spark plug 
before TDC is reached. (while the piston is 
traveling up)
– Measured in degrees
• Spark retard
Continued on next page…
EFI Performance tuning: Spark
• Advancing timing
• Benefits:
– Increased pressure, more powerful explosion == 
more power
• The drawbacks:
– Too much advance:
• No additional power
• Too much cylinder pressure
• More prone to pre‐ignition
• AKA detonation, aka knock
• Remember this picture: 
Continued on next page…
EFI Performance tuning: Air
• We will talk about knock 
more later
• Measuring air is necessary 
to calculate the correct 
fuel mix
– Increased pressure, more 
powerful explosion == more   
power
• Measuring air and
