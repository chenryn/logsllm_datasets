## Introduction

### Who Am I?
- **ASE Certified Mechanic?** No.
- **CISSP?** Not anymore; I used the dues to buy car parts.
- **Passion:** Technology, cars, and hacking.
- **Experience:** Successfully hacked my own car using Google, internet forums, open-source software, and a lot of hard work.
- **Thanks to:** Intrepidus Group for their support.

### What This Talk Is NOT About:
- Maintaining your car's warranty.
- Fuel economy or "green" driving.
- Installing a computer in your car for MP3s or gaming.
- Wardriving (thatâ€™s so 2002).

### What This Talk IS About:
- **Owning Your Car to Make It Faster:**
  - Introduction to modern computer-controlled engine management.
  - Tools for ECU programming (commercial and open-source).
  - Understanding car protocols and sensor roles in electronic fuel injection.
  - Performance tuning theory.
  - Using a dyno and alternative data collection methods.
  - Analyzing logs and making adjustments.
  - Turbochargers and superchargers.
  - Fuel octane and ignition timing.
  - Removing emissions equipment.
  - Computer-controlled alcohol or methanol for high boost and low-quality fuel.
  - ECU data and privacy concerns.
  - ECU firmware piracy.
  - Bypassing RFID chips in car keys.
  - Car modification laws.
  - OBDII emissions testing.

## From Past to Present

### Car Hackers Then and Now
- **Then:**
  - American iron, carburetors, ignition advance, dirt, and grime.
  - Power tools: Moonshine.
  - Method: Pour moonshine into the gas tank.
- **Now:**
  - Modern power tools: Alcohol, methanol, and advanced ECU programming.
  - Method: Precise tuning and performance upgrades.

### Displacement vs. Compression
- **Displacement:**
  - Example: 454 ci (7.44 liters) 8-cylinder big block, 500 hp.
- **Compression:**
  - Example: 152 ci (2.5 liters) 4-cylinder, 300 hp.
  - Compressing air and fuel for more power.

## Engine Control Unit (ECU)

### The Brain of Your Car
- **Function:** Controls fuel injection, ignition timing, and is programmable.
- **Methods of Altering the Code:**
  - **Replacement ECUs:**
    - Pros: Enhanced features, quick edits.
    - Cons: No OBDII, costly.
  - **EPROM Chips:**
    - Pros: Alters operation of older ECUs.
    - Cons: Slower, set-and-forget, soldering required.
  - **Piggy Back ECUs:**
    - Pros: Fast to market, extra features, quick edits.
    - Cons: Costly, increased complexity.
  - **ECU Re-flashing:**
    - Utilizes OBDII port (standard on cars 1996 and up).
    - Auto manufacturers use it for firmware updates.
    - Reverse engineering and DIY applications are becoming more common.
    - Portable re-flashers and laptop-based tuners offer preset settings and customizable options.
    - Open-source re-flashing tools are also available.

## Performance Tuning Fundamentals

### Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI)
- **Sensors:**
  - Oxygen (O2), Mass Air Flow (MAF), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP), Intake Air Temperature (IAT), Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Coolant Temperature, Knock Sensor.
- **Fuel:**
  - Optimal air-fuel ratio (AFR) for total combustion is ~14.7:1 (stoichiometric).
  - Engines typically run best at AFRs between 12.2:1 and 12.8:1.
  - ECU adjusts fuel mix based on sensor data.
- **Spark:**
  - Timing is crucial for optimal performance.
  - Advancing timing increases power but can lead to pre-ignition (knock).
- **Air:**
  - Measuring air is essential for calculating the correct fuel mix.
  - Increased pressure leads to more powerful explosions and more power.

## Conclusion

### What Can You Do with Complete Control Over Your ECU?
- **Potential for Damage:**
  - Incorrect tuning can cause significant engine damage (e.g., pistons, connecting rods).
- **Potential for Power:**
  - Proper tuning can significantly increase horsepower and torque.
  - Example: Stock 2006 Corvette (6-liter V8, 320 whp, 330 ft/lbs torque) vs. tuned (397 awhp, 401 ft/lbs torque).

### Dyno Testing
- **Dynamometer (Dyno):** A tool to measure engine power by placing load on the engine.
- **Example:**
  - Before tuning: 2.5-liter engine, 238 awhp, 242 ft/lbs torque.
  - After tuning: 397 awhp, 401 ft/lbs torque, estimated 500 hp after driveline loss.

### Final Thoughts
- Performance tuning is a complex but rewarding process.
- With the right knowledge and tools, you can unlock significant power from your car.
- Always proceed with caution and seek professional help if needed.
