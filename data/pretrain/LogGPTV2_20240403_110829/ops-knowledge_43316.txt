User:  Please provide an Openstack-based private cloud solution, including architecture design, component selection, network configuration, etc.
Assistant: The private cloud solution based on Openstack is as follows: 1. Architecture design The private cloud solution adopts a three-node architecture, including a control node, a computing node and a storage node. Among them, the control node is mainly responsible for the deployment and configuration of Openstack control plane components, the computing node is mainly responsible for the deployment and configuration of Openstack computing components, and the storage node is mainly responsible for the deployment and configuration of Openstack storage components. 2. Component selection The components selected for this private cloud solution include: - Control nodes: Keystone, Glance, Nova, Neutron, Horizon and other components. - Computing nodes: Nova Compute and other components. - Storage nodes: Cinder and other components. 3. Network configuration In terms of network configuration, the private cloud solution uses Openstack Neutron to connect the virtual network with the physical network, and use VLAN to isolate the virtual network. The architecture of the network is as follows: - External network: connects the public cloud and the Internet, and uses VLAN to isolate them. - Internal network: connect virtual machines and virtual routers and isolate them using VLANs. In addition, security groups need to be configured to restrict communication between virtual machines and between virtual machines and external networks.
