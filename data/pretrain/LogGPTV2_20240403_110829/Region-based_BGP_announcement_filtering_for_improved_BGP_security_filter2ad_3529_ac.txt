tain a non-negligible amount of stale information de-
spite daily update, due to, for example, unreported IP
address preﬁx (and ASNs) ownership transfers. Second,
ﬂagged BGP announcements may also be caused by cer-
tain legacy peering relationship arrangements. For ex-
ample, US ISPs announce a nontrivial number of pre-
ﬁxes allocated to other countries and regions. This is
likely because originally US provides the Internet back-
bone service for a large portion of the Internet. We
further note that, some of the ﬂagged announcements
may be related to preﬁx hijacks; not all hijacking events
were reported publicly.
Towards the end of this subsection we will discuss
how we can dramatically reduce the number of ﬂagged
BGP announcements under normal Internet operational
conditions by augmenting RBF with a small hash table
of the legacy preﬁx announcement arrangements. But
ﬁrst we perform an experiment to study the properties
of mismatched BGP announcements. In particular, we
are interested in learning which country and RIR regions
announce more ﬂagged preﬁxes and whose preﬁxes are
more likely to be announced by an AS in a diﬀerent
region.
4.2.2 Distributions of BGP Flags
Figure 8 shows the top 10 countries that announced
preﬁxes belonging to a diﬀerent country, and the num-
ber of ﬂagged BGP announcements from these coun-
tries. First we note that the country that announced
most ﬂagged BGP announcements is marked as “Eu-
rope”. This is caused by the fact that, a large number
of ASNs in the RIPE NCC allocation ﬁle are recorded as
allocated to Europe instead of a speciﬁc country. From
the ﬁgure we can also see that ﬁve European countries
are ranked in the top 10 countries that announced pre-
ﬁxes belonging to a diﬀerent country. We speculate this
is likely caused by the fact that, European countries may
provide Internet access for each other given that they
are geographically close and tightly related in economy.

To a degree, they should be considered as one country
in BGP announcement ﬁltering.
In Figure 9, we exclude the ﬂagged BGP announce-
ments whose origin AS belongs to “Europe” and the cor-
responding preﬁx belonging to an European country (or
vice versa). After removing such cases, US becomes the
top 1 country that announced preﬁxes belonging to a
diﬀerent country.
In addition, two new countries be-
come the top 10 countries in announcing preﬁxes be-
longing to a diﬀerent country and two drop out of the
top 10.
Figures 10 shows the top 10 countries whose IP ad-
dress preﬁxes are announced by other countries. Fig-
ure 11 shows the corresponding results after excluding
the ﬂagged announcements whose origin AS is allocated
to “Europe” and the announced preﬁx belongs to an
European country (or vice versa). As we can see, the
majority of the countries are European countries before
excluding “Europe”. This further conﬁrms our above
discussion that these countries may provide Internet ac-
cess for each other due to close economic relationship.
Figures 12 and 13 rank the RIRs in terms of ﬂagged
BGP announcements originated by an RIR-level region,
and the number of preﬁxes announced by a diﬀerent
region, respectively. From the ﬁgures we can see that
RIPE NCC region announced most ﬂagged BGP an-
nouncements, and ARIN is the region whose preﬁxes are
most likely to be announced by other regions. These ob-
servations could be caused by a number of reasons. His-
torically, RIPE NCC provides Internet access service
to some Asian countries. This may contribute to the
result that RIPE NCC region originated most ﬂagged
BGP announcements. Second, ARIN maintains a large
number of legacy preﬁx allocations. The information
related to this legacy preﬁx allocation information may
be outdated. These observations deserve further studies
in order to fully understand the results and the history
of the Internet development.
Figure 14 shows the total number of network preﬁxes
an AS announces and the number of ﬂagged preﬁxes
announced by the AS, for country-level RBF. We only
show the results for the ASes involved in at least one
ﬂagged BGP announcement. From the ﬁgure we cannot
draw a clear conclusion on the trend of what ASes are
more likely to announce ﬂagged preﬁxes. ASes with all
sizes (in terms of number of preﬁxes announced) may
announce ﬂagged preﬁxes, and smaller ASes appear to
have a higher percentage of ﬂagged preﬁxes than larger

ASes.
In order to study which types of network domains
are more likely to announce ﬂagged preﬁxes, we classify
networks into two types: stub and transit. Intuitively,
stub networks are the edge of the Internet; they are
customers of some ISPs and they do not provide Internet
access service for any other ASes. In contrast, transit
networks provide access service to others. We classify
networks using the following heuristic. A network is
considered as a stub network if its ASN only appears
as the ﬁrst (rightmost) ASN in the AS paths of the
BGP announcements of preﬁxes [28]. Otherwise, it is
considered as a transit network.
Figure 15 shows the daily number of ﬂagged preﬁxes
originated by diﬀerent types of networks in the time
interval (from 07/01/2008 to 07/07/2008), using the
country-level RBF. As we can see from the ﬁgure, the
vast majority (98%) of ﬂagged preﬁxes were announced
by stub networks. This is intuitively sound. First, stub
networks are more likely to transfer IP address preﬁxes
and ASNs to other stub networks following a company
bankruptcy or merge. Second, from a security’s view-
point, transit networks are in general better managed
and protected than stub networks. They are less likely
to announce, i.e., hijack, preﬁxes belonging to a diﬀer-
ent AS (as a consequence of either misconﬁguration or
intentional attacks).
4.2.3 Augmenting RBF with Legacy Arrangement
Information
In this subsection, we show that RBF can be aug-
mented by a small mapping table of the legacy preﬁx
arrangement that will trigger ﬂagged BGP announce-
ments. This augmentation can dramatically reduce the
number of ﬂagged BGP announcements. We note that
we augment RBF in this way because we do not have the
precise allocation information and a preﬁx may be an-
nounced by an AS in a diﬀerent region due to historical
reasons.
In order to obtain this mapping table for our exper-
iment study, we obtain the BGP routing tables (and
updates) on 06/30/2008, and consider all the ﬂagged
BGP announcements are caused by legacy ASN/preﬁx
arrangement. That is, we treat all the ﬂagged pairs of
ASN and preﬁx on 06/30/2008 as valid announcements
in the following days (from 07/01/2008 to 07/07/2008).

is somewhat arbitrary (although no BGP preﬁx hijack-
ing was reported on that day). In a real system, a sliding
window with a few days’ data should be used to estab-
lish the legacy preﬁx arrangement table.
Figures 16 and 17 show, for the country-level RBF,
the daily number of ﬂagged BGP announcements and
the percentage of these ﬂagged (with respect to the total
number of BGP announcements and ﬂagged BGP an-
nouncements without the mapping table augmentation),
respectively. From the ﬁgures we see that on average
only a small number (215) of BGP announcements will
be ﬂagged on a daily basis, which translates into 0.09%
of the daily average total BGP announcements. Given
this small number of ﬂagged BGP announcements, net-
work operators should be able to further analyze the
causes and respond to the ﬂags accordingly on a normal
day.
Figure 18: Number of new BGP ﬂags (country-
level).
In order to understand the dynamics of the BGP an-
nouncement ﬂags, in Figure 18 we show the number of
new BGP ﬂags after excluding the ﬂags seen in the pre-
vious day (excld ﬂags in prev day) and the new BGP
ﬂags after excluding the ﬂags seen in all the previous
day since 07/01/2008 (excld ﬂags in all prev days). Note
ﬁrst that removing old ﬂags in these two ways results in
almost identical number of new BGP ﬂags. Second, on
average, over 70% of BGP ﬂags were seen in the previous
days. That is, the ﬂagged BGP announcements were
relatively stable; the majority of them do not change
frequently.
To further understand the nature of the ASes involved
in the BGP ﬂags, we obtained the degree of an AS,
that is, the number of BGP peering neighbors of an AS.
Figure 19 shows the degree of the ASes involved in the
BGP ﬂags on 07/03/2008, which has 289 BGP ﬂags, the
largest in the week (AS degrees on other days show the
similar trend). As we can see from the ﬁgure, more than
60% of ASes have a degree of at least 5. In general, ASes
with a large degree are normally service providers, which
are less likely to announce false BGP routes. Flagged
BGP announcements originated from service providers
are more likely caused by preﬁx arrangement violating
the policy of RBF, for example, providing Internet ac-
cess service for networks in a diﬀerent region (in this
case, in diﬀerent country).
We also classify the ASes into their corresponding
countries, and show the top 10 countries that triggered
BGP ﬂags in Figure 20. In the ﬁgure we again show the
country as “Europe” for the ASes whose country infor-
mation shows “EU” instead of a speciﬁc country in the
allocation ﬁle. In addition to the top 10 countries, we
also cluster all the ﬂags in the rest countries and show
in the ﬁgure as “Other” (rightmost bar). We can see
from the ﬁgure that the majority of the ﬂags involve
ASes from the European countries. In particular, 168
out of 289, or about 60% of BGP ﬂags involve origi-
nating ASes and preﬁxes both from European countries.
As we have discussed early, European countries provide
Internet access for each other due to their geographical
proximity and tight economic relationship. Such BGP
announcements are likely to be valid ones but violate
the RBF policy.
In summary, the ﬂagged BGP announcements may be
caused by new preﬁx announcement arrangement that
violate the policy of RBF, or preﬁx hijacking. The way
we use yesterday’s allocation ﬁles to check the today’s
BGP announcements may also contribute to these mis-
matches. However, based on studies on the numbers
allocation in Section 4.1, using yesterday’s allocation
ﬁles should only incur a small number of mismatches,
if any. A more comprehensive study on the BGP ﬂags
is needed in order to understand the preﬁx announce-
ment behavior of ASes and to improve the performance
of RBF.
4.2.4 Impacts of Preﬁx Aggregation
In order to understand the impact of preﬁx aggrega-
tion on the performance of RBF, we also identiﬁed the
ASes that aggregated preﬁxes.
In this study we only
consider preﬁx aggregation that results in as set being
carried in a BGP announcement. We consider an AS
following the as set as the AS performing preﬁx aggre-

gation. Over the studied period from 07/01/2008 to
07/07/2008, the number of ASes that aggregated net-
work preﬁxes is small (21, 22, 22, 20, 20, 22, 22 ASes on
each day, respectively). Among these ASes, only two
ASes triggered BGP announcement ﬂags each day by
RBF (for both country-level and RIR-level). Moreover,
they are the same two ASes over the time duration.
From the above observations, we conclude that preﬁx
aggregation is only exercised by a small number of ASes,
and importantly, it does not have any major impacts on
the performance of RBF.
4.3 RBF with Known Preﬁx Hijacks
In this section we examine the eﬀectiveness of RBF
in detecting preﬁx hijacking attacks with known pre-
ﬁx hijack events. We examine the performance of RBF
for both large-scale hijacking events involving a large
number of network preﬁxes, and small-scale events that
may only involve as little as a single network preﬁx. We
use the following two well-documented preﬁx hijacking
events as examples. The AS9121 hijacking event repre-
sents a large preﬁx hijacking event [22]. On 12/24/2005,
AS9121 originated routes to about 100 K preﬁxes (about
a full BGP routing table at the time). A large number
of networks selected the routes originated by AS9121,
attracting a large portion of Internet traﬃc destined to
these preﬁxes to AS9121.
As an example of small-scale hijacking attacks,
in
the YouTube preﬁx hijacking attack [26], Pakistan Tele-
com (AS17557) originated preﬁx 208.65.153.0/24 be-
longing to YouTube. Because this preﬁx is more spe-
ciﬁc than the network preﬁx announced by YouTube
