All three evasion tactics are realistic threats and to some extent
already deployed in practice by the more advanced campaigns.
However, they all incur higher costs, cooldown or setup effort
per successful campaign registration and thus satisfy our goal to
economically disincentivize large campaigns.
7.2 Abuse of the system itself
Given the automated approach of Premadoma, malicious actors
could also deploy adversarial attacks. In particular, though not
trivial, a denial-of-service attack could be achieved if a perpetrator
were to introduce a large amount of new malicious registrations in
the system that closely mimic benign registrants and registration
facilitators. As such, both the reputation-based and similarity-based
models would start linking these patterns to malicious behavior
and block registrations made by a bonafide entity.
Although such an adversarial attack is hard to prevent in the
DNS registration ecosystem, it requires a substantial amount of
injected malicious registrations, which, due to the fact that they
must closely mimic benign registrations, comes at an even higher
cost for the attacker. Moreover, we propose an appeal procedure,
similar to the ones currently in place with blacklists, in which a
bonafide domain owner can contest erroneous decisions.
7.3 Limitations
Here, we discuss four limitations of this study and the proposed
predictive model.
Firstly, our proposed solution relies on blacklists for seeding the
daily training sets. Unfortunately, blacklists are inherently incom-
plete and, while we attempt to limit the impact of that, the quality
of our predictions depends on the quality and availability of the
ground truth labels.
Secondly, several registrars offer WHOIS privacy services to their
customers, obscuring the registrants contact information. Evidently,
this diminishes the ability to differentiate between registrations
of the same registrar and conceals information that Premadoma
relies upon. In the case of the .eu ccTLD, the use of WHOIS privacy
services actually violates the registry’s terms and conditions, and
are in itself a reason for suspension. 5
Additionally, Premadoma is focused on registrations belonging
to large-scale malicious campaigns. There is a residual minority
of malicious registrations, appearing as “one-offs”, that are not
explicitly targeted by the system.
Lastly, the goal of Premadoma is to increase the cost for attackers
to register malicious campaign domains. It is however hard to
quantify the exact cost increase necessary to bypass the system
we propose. Each campaign will have a different economic model
and return on investment, making it hard to gauge at which cost
attackers will be deterred. Nonetheless, by placing Premadoma
in production and conducting several takedowns, we witness a
strong reduction in the amount of malicious registrations in 2018
(see Figure 8).
8 RELATED WORK
In previous work, Vissers et al. [22] extensively analysed 14 months
of registration data to identify large-scale malicious campaigns
present in the .eu TLD. Their insights in the ecosystem of mali-
cious domain registrations directly underpin the foundations of the
detection and prevention techniques proposed in this paper.
Prior to our research, Hao et al. [10] studied the domain regis-
tration behavior of spammers and suggested that, given the use of
large-scale campaigns, registries and registrars are well-positioned
to interfere with bulk registrations by malicious actors. The ef-
fects of several registrar-level interventions had already been docu-
mented by Liu et al. [15]. A key concern the latter authors raise, is
the ability of attackers to quickly and easily change to a different,
non-intervening registrar.
In a more recent paper, Hao et al. [9], introduce PREDATOR, a
system that can be used by registrars or registries to detect malicious
domain registrations at registration time. PREDATOR is an impor-
tant predecessor of this research and has evaluated the feasibility of
registration-time detection. In contrast, Premadoma was designed
and evaluated in the operational setting of a top ccTLD. Our pro-
posed method therefore strongly focused on tactics to handle the
inherent domain-specific challenges such as ground truth imbal-
