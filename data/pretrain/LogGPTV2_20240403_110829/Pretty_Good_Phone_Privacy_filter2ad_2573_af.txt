A Glossary
AKA
Authentication and Key Agreement. The process by
which the UE and the AUSF exchange information by
which they can each verify a secret key held by the other,
and calculate keys to be used for ciphering and integrity
protection of data transmitted between the UE and the
network. 12
AMF
Access and Mobility Management Function. The control
entity that manages signaling between the UE and the
core network. AMF supports functions related to bearer
and connection management and manages mobility be-
tween gNodeBs. 2–4, 8, 11, 12
AUSF
Authentication Server Function. The entity that holds
subscription information to allow or deny access to the
network. 2, 3, 7, 12, 13
Diameter
The authentication, authorization, and accounting proto-
col used by 4G/5G cellular networks. Diameter is used
to enable roaming between modern cellular networks. 5,
6
EIR
Equipment Identity Register. A database that stores
IMEIs of devices in cellular systems. IMEIs can be
white-listed, grey-listed or black-listed. The EIR allows
a device’s identity to be checked for blacklisting, (e.g.,
whether is has been reported stolen). 6
gNodeB
Next Generation NodeB. The base station in 5G. 2–4,
8–12
GUTI
Globally Unique Temporary Identity. The GUTI is a
temporary identiﬁer that can be used in lieu of an IMSI
to identify a subscriber to the core network. 3, 4, 6, 7, 13
IMEI
International Mobile Equipment Identity. A globally
unique, permanent device identiﬁer which is allocated
to each individual mobile device. It is set by the manu-
facturer. 6
IMS
IP Multimedia Subsystem. The entity that provides voice
and messaging services for the network. 5
IMSI
International Mobile Subscriber Identity. A globally
unique identiﬁer associated with each mobile phone sub-
scriber in 4G LTE. It is stored in the SIM inside the
phone and is sent by the phone to the network. 2, 3, 5,
12, 13
MNO
Mobile Network Operator. A cellular service provider.
2, 8
MVNO
Mobile Virtual Network Operator. A cellular operator
that does not necessarily own its own spectrum or all of
the network equipment it operates upon. MVNOs run on
top of MNO networks. 2, 3, 6–8
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    1753
NG-RAN
Next Generation Radio Access Network. Network that
serves to connect UEs and gNodeBs. 2, 4
NGC
Next Generation Core. The core network in 5G. Main
logical nodes of the NGC are the User Plane Func-
tion (UPF), Access and Mobility Management Function
(AMF), the Session Management Function (SMF), and
Authentication Server Function (AUSF). 1–3, 6, 12
PGPP-GW
PGPP Gateway. A proposed gateway for PGPP that sits
between the UPF and the global Internet. The PGPP-GW
allows for billing without requiring the user’s identity. 7,
8
RNTI
Radio Network Temporary Identiﬁer. A unique identiﬁer
for a UE in a given cell, used to connect over layer 2. 3,
4
SIM
Subscriber Identity Module. An entity that holds the
IMSI, which uniquely identiﬁes a subscriber. SIMs are
used to authenticate a user to the network. 2, 3, 5, 7, 12,
13
SMF
Session Management Function. The session managment
function supports session management and IP address
allocation. 2, 4, 6
SQN
Sequence Number. A value stored at the AUSF and the
SIM to maintain synchrony between the entities. 12
SS7
down voice calls, deliver SMS, etc. SS7 has been largely
replaced by Diameter in modern cellular standards. 5
SUCI
Subscription Concealed Identiﬁer. The SUCI is a tem-
porary identiﬁer that can be used in lieu of a SUPI to
identify a subscriber to the 5G network. The SUCI uses
cryptographic primitives to hide the SUPI from eaves-
droppers. 3, 5
SUPI
Subscription Permanent Identiﬁer. A globally unique
identiﬁer associated with each mobile phone subscriber
in 5G networks. It is stored in the SIM inside the phone
and is sent by the phone to the network. 2–7, 10, 12, 13
TA
Tracking Area. A tracking includes one or many gN-
odeBs. Typically, the UE can move freely within gN-
odeBs in a tracking area without notifying the AMF
with a tracking area update. 4, 9, 10, 12
TAL
TAP
UE
UPF
Tracking Area List. A list of tracking areas stored on
the device that the device can enter without triggering a
tracking area update. 4–6, 8–12
Transferred Account Procedure. A ﬁle detailing usage
and wholesale charges due to roaming. 6
User Equipment. The mobile device which allows a user
to access network services, connecting to the UTRAN
or E-UTRAN via the radio interface. Commonly under-
stood to be a mobile phone. 2–4, 7–13
Signaling System 7. The protocol standard used by en-
tities on public switched telephone networks commu-
nicate with one another. SS7 is used to setup and tear
User Plane Function. The gateway that provides global
IP connectivity from the NGC.. 2–4, 6, 7
