### Expected Behavior
Google API should work as it they are meant to.
### Actual behavior
Any Google API calls may crash renderer process (even if they are run on
Worker thread).  
The request may be done and the answer given, but immediately or after several
seconds the renderer process may crash.
### To Reproduce
    $ git clone https://github.com/ruslang02/youtube-electron-crash-example
    $ npm install electron@beta
    $ npm start || electron .
Version 5 will randomly crash, version 4: doesn't
