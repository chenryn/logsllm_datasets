User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What specific assurances exist about StartPage privacy? What specific, technical and verifiable information exists to support StartPage’s claims about privacy? For example, they claim in the “Privacy” section of their iPhone app:


  StartPage does not record any information about its users. Zero. Zilch. Nada.


and


  [O]ur privacy practices are regularly audited and third-party certified.


I am skeptical because they essentially claim to serve up Google results anonymously. It seems surprising to me that Google would allow this, and even more surprising that StartPage asserts that


  [Y]ou receive authentic Google results but you're never seen by Google[...]

Assistant: Startpage.com has a contract with Google that allows us to use their official "Syndicated Web Search" feed, so we have to pay them to get those results. Sometimes we get slightly different results, but in general, they are the same high quality.

We serve those results to you in privacy. Google never sees you, and we never log any user personal information. Even Edward Snowden has recommended Startpage.com for its no-logging privacy.

You can be sure we never share your personal details with any third party, including Google. Your privacy is absolutely secured. You can read more about this in our privacy policy.

Can users trust Startpage.com do do what it says and maintain its privacy promises? We have an article on this here.
