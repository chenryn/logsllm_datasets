Not sure if this is a duplicate, but, if I have a function like:
    function f()
        a = 1
        b = 1
        f(a b)
    end
then I get an error like:
    julia> include("test.jl")
    ERROR: syntax: missing comma or ) in argument list
    while loading /home/simon/Desktop/test.jl, in expression starting on line 1
It would be nice if the line number matched up with the line where the error
was actually encountered, rather than the start of the function.
