User: Today is my first day at Python and have been going through problems. One that I was working on was, "Write a short program which extracts the current date and time from the operating system and prints it on screen in the following format: day, month, year, current time in GMT.
Demonstrate that it works." 
I was going to use pytz, so used easy_install pytz 
This installed it in my site-packages (pytz-2012d-py2.7.egg)
Is this the correct directory for me to be able to import the module?
In my python shell i use from pytz import timezone I get, 
"ImportError: No module named pytz"
Any ideas? Thanks in advance
Assistant: It is important if you are using python v2 or python v3 - it has separate easy_install package!
In debian there are:
python-pip
python3-pip
and then 
easy_install
easy_install3
If you use wrong version of easy_install you will be updating wrong libraries.
