### Convert Basic Disk to Dynamic Disk

This command converts a basic disk into a dynamic disk. To use this command, you must first select a basic disk using the `select disk` command.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
convert dynamic [noerr]
```

#### Parameters
- **noerr**: (For scripting only) If an error is encountered, DiskPart will continue processing commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

#### Remarks
- Ensure that the selected disk is a basic disk before running the `convert dynamic` command.
- For instructions on how to change a dynamic disk back to a basic disk, see the documentation for that specific operation.

#### Examples
To convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk, follow these steps:
1. Select the basic disk:
   ```plaintext
   select disk <disk_number>
   ```
2. Convert the selected disk to a dynamic disk:
   ```plaintext
   convert dynamic
   ```

Replace `<disk_number>` with the actual number of the basic disk you want to convert.
