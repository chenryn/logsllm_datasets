User: In python, what's the limit of log-file's size by default? 10M, 2G, or some other limit?
Where can I find this information in the API?  I know the rollback of RotateFileHandlers, it can configure. Thanks.
Assistant: Maximum size of a file is filesystem dependant. There's nothing about it in Python.
