Question: "You are a web developer tasked with enhancing the security of a web application. You need to ensure that your application adheres to the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) to prevent potential security breaches. Given your understanding of SOP, which of the following scenarios correctly reflect the policy's implementation and exceptions?"
 "A": "The application uses XMLHttpRequest to fetch data from an API endpoint that resides on the same domain as the web page's origin."
 "B": "The application incorporates an image from a third-party server using an <IMG> tag with the SRC attribute pointing to the third-party URL, and the browser enforces SOP on the retrieved pixels but not on the request itself."
 "C": "The application allows embedding an iframe from a different origin, and the script within the iframe can freely access the parent document's DOM."
 "D": "The application contains a link to an external site, and when a user clicks the link, the browser navigates to the new page without sending any cookies that belong to the destination site."
