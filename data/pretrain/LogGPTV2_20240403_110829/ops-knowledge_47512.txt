User: I am writing a simple Python script with no GUI. I want to be able to drag and drop multiple files onto my python script and have access to their absolute paths inside of the script. How do I do this in Mac, Linux, and windows? For times sake, just Mac will be fine for now.
I've googled this question and only found one related one but it was too confusing. I am currently running Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
Any help is much appreciated.
Thanks!
Assistant: Usually when you drag a file onto a script/executable, the OS passes the path to that file as a command-line argument. Check sys.argv
