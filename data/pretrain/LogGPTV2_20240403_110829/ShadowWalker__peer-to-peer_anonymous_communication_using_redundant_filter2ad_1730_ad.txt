In our system, we use the degree d = 13 and r = 2. In the
next section, we will see that this translates into an eﬀec-
tive degree of 39 ((r + 1) · d). This is comparable to the
eﬀective degree of Salsa in this conﬁguration, which is 85
(10000/128+log2 128). We can see that for f = 0.2, our pro-
tocol using l = 5 has an entropy of 12, while Salsa only has
an entropy of 7.5. Even our modiﬁed protocol which uses
only two hops for anonymous communication, gives much
better anonymity than Salsa.
4.5 Selective DoS Attack
Recently, Borisov et al. [5] proposed a selective denial-
of-service attack on anonymous communication. In this at-
tack, malicious nodes can selectively drop packets in order
to shut down any circuits that they are a part of, but which
they cannot compromise. Borisov et al. found that selective
DoS attack is most eﬀective against peer-to-peer anonymous
communication systems, because the circuit construction in
P2P systems is complex and may provide many nodes with
the opportunity to selectively deny service. Our design is
vulnerable to the selective DoS attack in two ways:
Selective DoS by shadows: As a shadow node, a malicious
node M may refuse to give signatures to honest nodes, or
may give incorrect signatures to honest nodes. This attack
will ensure that the honest nodes who have a malicious node
as a shadow will never get selected in the random walk as
an intermediate node, since the initiator will not be able to
verify the neighbor relationships.
Selective DoS during circuit construction: Malicious nodes
can also selectively break any circuits that they cannot com-
promise. Whenever malicious nodes ﬁnd that they are part
of a circuit in which they are unable to infer any informa-
tion about the initiator, they stop forwarding packets on the
circuit, causing a new circuit to be constructed. This attack
is similar to the selective-DoS attack on Tor described by
Borisov et al.
We can mitigate the ﬁrst attack by using a symmetric
shadow relationship. This means that if node A is a shadow
of node B, then node B is a shadow of node A. If a node stops
receiving signatures from its shadow, it can reciprocate by
no longer certifying the shadow’s routing information. As a
result, malicious nodes that do not follow the protocol and
refuse to provide signatures will themselves be excluded from
the circuit construction process. An adversary may decide
to sacriﬁce its nodes, and in this process DoS (atmost) r
honest nodes. However, since small redundancy levels of
r = 2, 3 suﬃce for the security of our protocol, this strategy
does not beneﬁt the adversary.
For the second attack, the best strategy for malicious
nodes is to shut down any circuit in which the last node
is honest, since there is no hope of compromising it. Thus
the only circuits that will be built are those where the last
node is compromised, or where all the nodes are honest. The

Figure 10 plots the entropy for our protocol under the se-
lective DoS attack. There is an interesting tradeoﬀ here.
On one hand,
increasing circuit length mitigates the re-
stricted topology attack and increases anonymity. On the
other hand, increasing circuit length gives more opportuni-
ties to the attackers to launch a selective DoS attack. We can
see that for small values of f , the former eﬀect dominates,
and increasing circuit length increases anonymity. There is
a crossover point at about 18% of compromised nodes, when
increasing circuit length beyond l = 4 becomes counterpro-
ductive, because of the selective-DoS attack. We note that
our modiﬁed protocol, in which the initiator only chooses
the last two hops for anonymous communication, provides
a good defense against the selective-DoS attack. This is be-
cause the intermediate hops do not decide to abort until the
circuit construction has reached the last hop. However, at
that point, only the second-to-last hop can perform denial-
of-service on the circuit. We can see from the ﬁgure, that
l = 2–5 is most resilient to selective-DoS attack. Also note
that selective-DoS presents a signiﬁcant problem for Salsa.
Salsa is able to provide only 4 bits of entropy at f = 0.2, as
compared to about 11.5 bits of entropy for l =2–5.
5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We implemented our protocol using an event-based simu-
lator in C++ with 1.2KLOC. We consider a WAN setting,
where latencies between each pair of nodes are estimated us-
ing the King data set [20]. This data set contains measured
latencies between Internet domain name servers (DNS) and
is highly heterogeneous. The average round trip time (RTT)
in the data set is around 182ms and the maximum RTT is
around 800ms. To handle churn, we run the stabilization
protocol every second. The time period for refreshing ﬁn-
gers and signing certiﬁcates is also set to 1 second. We sim-
ulate our protocol for N = 1000 nodes with a redundancy
parameter r = 2 and d = 10.
Studies have shown that in many popular peer-to-peer
networks, the mean value of node uptime is about 60 min-
utes [3,40]. We considered two widely used synthetic models
for node uptime 1) PDF f (x) = λe−λx. We set λ = 1/60.
This is an exponential distribution with mean 60 minutes.
2)PDF f (x) = aba
(x+b)a+1 . We set a = 1.5, 2, 3 and b ﬁxed so
that the distribution had mean 60 minutes. This is a stan-
dard Pareto distribution, shifted b units (without the shift,
a node would be guaranteed to be up for at least b minutes).
5.1 Communication Overhead
Topology maintenance: As compared to a structured net-
work, the overhead for topology maintenance in our protocol
is higher due to the inherent redundancy in topology. The
transformation from a structured topology to a redundant
structured topology increases the eﬀective node degree from
d to (r + 1)2d. (Each ﬁnger has r shadows, and each node
is a shadow for (around) r + 1 nodes.) An important con-
sequence of our secure lookup protocol is that along with
the node corresponding to the chosen ID, its shadows are
returned as well. This signiﬁcantly reduces the communica-
tion overhead of our protocol because it obviates the need
for performing multiple secure lookups for the shadows of
ﬁngers. The use of our secure lookup protocol reduces the
eﬀective node degree to (r + 1) · d. In the previous section,
we had seen that our system provides better anonymity than
Salsa with similar eﬀective node degree. For N = 1000 nodes
and r = 2, the mean communication overhead per node was
measured to be 5980 bytes/sec.
Circuit Setup: To establish a circuit of length l, the initiator
performs l key establishments and rl signature veriﬁcations.
The corresponding ﬁgure for Salsa is r(l − 1) + 1 key estab-
lishments and r2(l − 1) + r lookups. The table below shows
the mean circuit setup latency. We can see that even for
l = 6, the circuit setup time is less than 4 seconds. Since we
avoid the use of lookups, the circuit setup latency for our
protocol is smaller than Salsa.

5.2 Reliability of Circuit Construction under
Churn
Due to churn, the routing states at diﬀerent nodes may
be inconsistent at times, resulting in diﬀerent views of the
network. This will mean that corresponding signatures by
shadow nodes for the routing state of a node A may not be
consistent, and our circuit construction protocol may fail.
