 **Eberhard Wolff** opened **SPR-6870** and commented
The Autowiring algorithms tries to work out the dependencies by building up
the Beans. If this fails, a BeanCreationException is thrown, caught and then a
different way to handle the dependencies is tried. In some situations this
results in slow performance and it is probably also not the nicest programming
style.
