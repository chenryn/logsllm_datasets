User: I'm using Django and PyDev/Eclipse. I just installed django-treebeard with setup.py install and it got installed in my site-packages directory C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages. I can successfully import it in the python shell with import treebeard. However PyDev complains that it cannot resolve it when I try to import it. 
Unfortunately I have no experience with PyDev and I assumed that it would automatically pick up everything in the site-packages directory but apparently it does not. What am I missing?
thanks
Assistant: I also faced the same error when i had installed a new package.i'm using eclipse Helios.
Even after applying and re scanning the folder it was NOT detecting the new packages. So finally i clicked on the "Click here to configure a interpreter not listed" listed and deleted the already selected interpreter and used the autoconfig to add the interpreter again.
Finally i was able to resolve the issue.
