User: I want to create executable with pyinstaller (in ubuntu). My program works, but when I create executable, program doesn't work. Problem is probably in command os.mkdir. How can I solve it? Thank you.
Assistant: if the problem is indeed os.makedir you will need to run the program as administrator, or pick a non-protected folder to mkdir in ...
Unfortunately is sounds like you are not sure this is the problem, if you build your executable with --console flag you will probably get output that tells you exactly what the problem is...
