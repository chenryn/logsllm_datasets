### The Road Less Traveled: The Loss of Locational Privacy While Traveling in Your Automobile

**Presented by @pukingmonkey at DEF CON 21**

#### Introduction
This presentation explores the erosion of locational privacy while traveling in your automobile, focusing on technologies such as Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPRs), transponder-based Electronic Toll Collection (ETC), GPS, and other tracking devices.

#### Do You Have the Right to Travel?
- **Interstate Travel**: Yes. According to *Saenz v. Roe* (1999), the right to travel is guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
- **Intrastate Travel**: Yes, but less clear. It is usually derived from First Amendment freedom of association and Fifth Amendment due process protection.
- **International Travel**: Yes. *Kent v. Dulles* (1958) states that the right to travel is part of the "liberty" protected by the Fifth Amendment.

#### Do You Have the Right to Drive?
- No. Driving is a privilege, not a right, and is regulated, licensed, and can be revoked according to the laws of each jurisdiction.

#### Do You Have the Right to Anonymous Travel?
- Mostly yes, but it depends on the mode of travel:
  - **Driving**: No, requires licensing.
  - **Commercial Flights**: No, requires ID.
  - **Crossing National Borders**: No, requires ID.

#### Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPRs)
- **Functionality**: A system of cameras, computers, and GPS that reads license plates using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), records coordinates and time, and can be mobile or fixed.
- **Capacity**: Can process about 3,000 plates per hour, even on vehicles moving up to 130 MPH.
- **Data Storage**: All data is saved and downloaded to a central repository.
- **Privacy Concerns**:
  - Captures all plates in its field of vision.
  - Data retained for 21 days to 5 years, depending on the jurisdiction.
  - Sufficient ALPRs and data points can track an individual's movements.
  - Example: NYC had 108 fixed and 130 mobile ALPRs as of 2009.
  - Opt-out is impossible.

#### Legal Aspects of Warrantless Tracking
- **Legality**:
  - *Hester v. United States* (1924): Observations without physical intrusion do not implicate the Fourth Amendment.
  - *United States v. Martin* (1986): Police can look into parked car windows if lawfully present.
  - No reasonable expectation of privacy for license plates in public.
  - Police do not need a warrant to "run" a plate.

- **Supreme Court Rulings**:
  - *United States v. Jones* (2012): A warrant is needed to place a tracking device on a vehicle, not for the act of tracking.
  - *Kyllo v. United States* (2001): Infrared cannot be used to look inside constitutionally protected areas.
  - *Florida v. Riley* (1989): Aerial surveillance is permissible.
  - *United States v. Lee* (1927): Artificial illumination can aid observations.
  - Binoculars can be used (no Supreme Court case, but Justice Scalia has stated it is acceptable).

#### ALPR Data Retention
- **New Hampshire**: General ban on retention.
- **Maine**: Maximum 21-day retention for non-hit, non-criminal investigations.
- **New Jersey**: Must retain for 5 years, then destroy after 5 years.
- **New York City**: Retained for 5 years, even though general surveillance video is deleted after 21 days if no active investigation.

#### Data Accessibility
- **Public Access**: Maybe. Minneapolis initially released data but later redacted GPS coordinates.
- **Legal Discovery**: New York has "Rosario material," but ALPR data is not considered a "statement" and thus not subject to discovery.

#### Commercial Market for ALPR Data
- **Vigilant Solutions**: Serves only Law Enforcement, operating in 28 metro areas with over 35 million reads per month.
- **Tow Operators**: Scan everything, looking for repo hits, and sell the data.
- **Law Enforcement**: Can purchase this data.
- **Public Purchase**: Available for $10 per record from tlo.com.

#### Building a License Plate Reader Detector
- **Concept**: Uses infrared LEDs to illuminate the plate, which are always on and pulsating.
- **Detection**: IR photodiodes can detect the LED pulses.
- **Challenges**: Some failures occurred. ELSAG's unit uses 735nm LEDs, which are near-IR or far-red.
- **Videos**: Proof-of-concept ALPR detector and a demonstration of a monkey screaming when a plate is read.

#### Countermeasures
- **No Front Plate**: Even if required.
- **Masking the Back Plate**: Use dark plastic or alternating Fresnel lenses.
- **Drive with Tailgate Down**: Not legal.
- **Tint Windows and Windshield**: Not legal.
- **California Specific**: Drive a new car without tags for 90 days (was 6 months while Steve Jobs was alive), but cannot drive outside California.
- **Temporary Tags**: Valid for 20 to 90 days.
- **Register Vehicle to a Company**: Hides you in a thin veil, but plates are still recorded.
- **Avoid Commercial Tags**.

#### Challenging ALPRs
- **Non-Reflective Plates**: Removing reflectivity is illegal in some states.
- **Low Contrast Plates**: Harder to read.
- **Light Red Characters and Stacked Letters**: More difficult to process.
- **Registration Stickers Close to Letters**: Interferes with OCR.
- **8-Digit Plates**: Smaller and narrower letters.
- **No Front Plate**: Reduces the chance of being read.

#### Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) Tags
- **Functionality**: Always on, operates at 915MHz in the US.
- **Protocols**: Multiple non-compatible protocols like IAG (E-Zpass), California Title 21, Allegro, and eGo.
- **RFID Technology**: Some with battery assist, some without.
- **Videos**: Demonstrations of E-Zpass detectors and their operation.
- **Data Usage**: NYSDOT uses it for "travel time" signs.
- **Data Retention**: Tag info for travel time is “scrambled” and “deleted after the vehicle has left the highway,” but this could not be verified.
- **NSA Access**: Reports indicate the NSA gets E-Zpass data.

#### What to Do?
- **Bag the Tag**: Only bring out the tag when paying a toll.
- **Faraday Cage Box**: For sticker-based systems.
- **Awareness**: Toll usage will make it obvious to watchers that you are taking precautions.

#### Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS)
- **Federal TREAD Law**: Mandates TPMS.
- **TPMS Transmitters**: 315MHz, located at the valve stem, with a unique ID.
- **RFID in Tires**: Unique per tire, with different frequencies used by different manufacturers.

#### Other RFID Devices
- **Parking Passes**: Often use RFID, either as hang tags or stickers.
- **Private and Municipal Use**: Need to bag them if not in use, but public parking permits are a challenge.

#### INRIX
- **Data Collection**: Collects position data from 100 million devices across 1.8 million miles of road.
- **Usage**: Google Maps, built-in navigation systems in cars, and top navigation apps.
- **Dumb Phones**: Share location data through cell towers.
- **Commercial Truck Fleets**: Also contribute to data collection.

#### Conclusion
- **Salt the Plate**: Make it harder for ALPRs to read.
- **Bag the Tag**: Prevent ETC tag from being read.
- **Zap and Jam the Tires**: Disrupt TPMS and RFID signals.
- **Turn Them Off**: Ensure all tracking devices are disabled when not in use.
