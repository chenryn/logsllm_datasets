User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of computing data for a Spark application. The CacheManager is looking for partitions rdd_42_30, rdd_42_31, and rdd_42_32, and when they are not found, they are computed using HadoopRDD. The PythonRunner is timing the total, boot, init, and finish times for each task. The Executor is running tasks 26.0, 27.0, 28.0, 29.0, and 33.0 in stage 26.0, and is sending the results to the driver.
