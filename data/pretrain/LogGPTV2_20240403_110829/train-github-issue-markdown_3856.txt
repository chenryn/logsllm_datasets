In less, scrolling down (f) is instantaneous, but scrolling up (u) is
extremely slow. For example, if I open `man man` and hold `f`, it takes about
1 second to scroll to the end, but if I hold `u`, it will take about 10
seconds to scroll back to the top.
Behavior is similar if I run `less` on a remote system through SSH, although
in that case scrolling up gives the appearance of being 'jerkier'.
