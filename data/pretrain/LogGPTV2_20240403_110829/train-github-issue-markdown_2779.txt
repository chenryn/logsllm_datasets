The link that states "Requests 3.0 development is underway, and your financial
help is appreciated!"  
at the top of every doc page (eg: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/),
currently points to the url:
https://www.kennethreitz.org/requests3
Which, at the time of writing is a "404 not found" page.
I'd like to learn about requests 3, so this should point somewhere useful :)
