The notice at the top of every documentation page (e.g., http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) states, "Requests 3.0 development is underway, and your financial help is appreciated!" However, the link currently points to https://www.kennethreitz.org/requests3, which, as of now, results in a "404 Not Found" error.

I am interested in learning more about Requests 3.0, so it would be helpful if the link could be updated to point to a relevant and functional resource. Alternatively, the notice could be temporarily removed until a suitable destination is available.
