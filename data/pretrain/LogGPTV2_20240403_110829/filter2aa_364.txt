### History of Deception Detection

#### Trial by Ordeal
- A primitive method of determining a person's guilt or innocence by subjecting the accused to dangerous or painful tests believed to be under divine control.

#### Trial by Combat
- An ancient dispute resolution method where those in dispute would fight one another until submission or death.

#### Trial by Torture
- An act where severe pain is intentionally inflicted on a person to obtain a confession of guilt.

#### The "Third Degree"
- A euphemism used for trial by torture when employed by the police.

#### The Adversarial Justice System
- A two-sided structure under which criminal trial courts operate, with both prosecution and defense presenting their cases.

### History of the Polygraph

#### 1920s
- Development of the modern polygraph.

#### 1930s
- The polygraph begins its move into the private sector.

#### 1940s to 1950s
- The polygraph gains prominence during the Cold War era.

#### 1960s to 1970s
- Rapid spread of the polygraph in both government and private sectors.

#### 1980s
- Passage of the Polygraph Protection Act.

#### 1990s to Today
- Continued use and evolution of the polygraph.

### How We Built Our DIY Polygraph

#### Initial Steps
- Starting with basic components and design.

#### Respiratory Rate
- Measuring the rate and depth of breathing.

#### Galvanic Skin Response
- Monitoring changes in skin conductance.

#### Pulse
- Tracking heart rate and blood pressure.

### How It Works

#### Oldgrover's Super Sweet Breathing Band
- Description of the breathing band and its functionality.

#### Outside the Box
- External components and their roles.

#### Inside the Box
- Internal components and their integration.

### Trying to Beat the DIY Polygraph

#### The Numbers Test
- Using numerical strategies to confuse the polygraph.

#### Breathing Strategy
- Techniques to control breathing and mask physiological responses.

#### Biting Tongue
- Physical methods to alter physiological readings.

#### Contracting Anal Sphincter Muscle
- Another physical method to influence the polygraph results.

### The Data Aftermath

#### What Went Right
- Successful aspects of the polygraph and the testing process.

#### Surprises and Pitfalls
- Unexpected findings and challenges encountered.

#### Future Improvements
- Potential enhancements and areas for further development.

### Shoutouts and Thanks!

- Special thanks to Psychedelicbike, Oldgrover, Christian Gruber, Int80, Dead Addict, Anonymous, Brad Smith, Seth Hardy, and the rest of the Neuronumerous Group.
