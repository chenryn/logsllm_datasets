Why Build an EV? 
Today there are limited production electric vehicles available, so converting an existing 
internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle to an electric vehicle (EV) might be the best 
current choice available to obtain an EV.  
Building your own EV can be a rewarding and challenging experience. Not only will you be a 
pioneer in the EV movement, but you will also be recycling a car that may be headed for the 
junk yard. Don’t wait for Detroit. Custom build an EV yourself1. 
A typical EV conversion will achieve a range of 30-60 miles for each charge. Studies have 
shown that 80% of commuters travel less than 40 miles per day, and 50% of commuters 
travel 20 miles or less per day. An EV conversion can meet those daily driving needs.  
EVs are a clean, efficient alternative to conventional vehicles – using technology that is 
readily available today! EVs produce zero emissions, and when you consider the full fuel 
cycle to generate electricity, are up to 99% cleaner than gasoline and diesel vehicles.  EV 
owners enjoy the financial benefits of significantly lower fuel and maintenance expenses. 
Finally, EVs help reduce our dependence on oil.  
What steps are involved? 
This overview provides a high level framework for performing a conversion. Please review 
the references and other links (in the next section) for more complete information. 
1. Determine your driving needs: range – the distance you travel in a single day; type of 
vehicle – family car, commuter, utility vehicle, or racing car.  
2.  Look for an EV kit for the vehicle you choose. Kits will make the conversion significantly 
easier – they include all of the parts, except batteries.  A conversion kit will cost about 
$4,000-$6,000, and the batteries, depending on how many you need, can cost another 
$700-$1,200. 
3. Make sure you have access to the proper tools and supplies, and a place to do the 
conversion.  You may need to rent equipment like engine hoists and contract out 
welding work. Contact EV veterans for advice and assistance. 
4. Familiarize yourself with the EV components that will be installed. The most common 
batteries for EV conversions are lead-acid batteries, specifically, 12-volt sealed batteries. 
5. Safety. Any project involving automobiles and tools has inherent risks. Be aware of 
these possible hazards to prevent damage to the vehicle and serious injury to you. 
6. Remove the ICE components, making room for the EV components. 
7. Install the motor, components, battery box, and batteries. 
8. Install the wiring for propulsion (traction pack), auxiliary power system (12-volt 
system), and traction pack charging system, and displays and controls. 
9. Safety testing. Test the battery charger; check the wiring and fuses, 
connections. Then take it out for a spin and notice the quiet, smooth ride. Be 
sure to show it off!
