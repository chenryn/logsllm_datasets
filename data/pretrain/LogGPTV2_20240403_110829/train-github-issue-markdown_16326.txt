I am encountering a compiler error when using Python 3.8, although the code works correctly with Python 3.7. The error message is as follows: "cannot convert nullptr to Py_ssize_t" for files containing the `_tp_print_` function.

For example:
- In `torch\csrc\Dtype.cpp` at line 65, the issue occurs with `nullptr` in the `_tp_print_` function.

Could you please help resolve this bug for all files that use the `_tp_print_` function?
