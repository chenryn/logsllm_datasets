User: I write a simple script that executes a system command on a sequence of files.
To speed things up, I'd like to run them in parallel, but not all at once - i need to control maximum number of simultaneously running commands.
What whould be the easiest way to approach this ?
Assistant: If your running system commands you can just create the process instances with the subprocess module, call them as you want. There shouldn't be any need to thread (its unpythonic) and multiprocess seems a tad overkill for this task.
