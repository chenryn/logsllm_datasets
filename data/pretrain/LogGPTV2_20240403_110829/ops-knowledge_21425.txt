User: I have been trying to get supervisor running as a non root user but came against problems time after time. The more I have read into it the more it looks like supervisor is meant to be run as root.
I even read somewhere that it is only possible to run subprocesses as their own users under supervisor if supervisor is running as root.
MY question is, is it possible to get supervisor to run as non-root and still start subprocesses as non-root users also. Secondly, other then creating the user and setting the user in the supervisor.conf, is there anything else I have to do?
Assistant: To be able to run any subprocess as a different user from what supervisord is running as, you must run supervisord as root.
When you run supervisord as a user other than root, it cannot run subprocesses under another user. This is a UNIX process security restriction.
