### Detailed Investigation of Port 0 Traffic in IPv4

The difference in reachable addresses is most pronounced in IPv4, prompting a more detailed examination of this phenomenon. We identified, on a per-target basis, the addresses that do not respond to TCP/0 but do respond to TCP/80. These non-responsive port 0 addresses were mapped to 4102 distinct Autonomous Systems (ASes), displaying a long-tailed distribution.

To rule out the possibility of missing responses due to ICMP rate limiting, we checked for other responsive addresses within these 4102 ASes. Only 15 of these ASes (0.4% of the total) responded to port 0 traceroutes, confirming that these ASes handle port 0 traffic differently compared to other ports. As shown in Table 2, 9 out of the top 10 ASes are associated with Internet Service Providers (ISPs), suggesting that these ASes may be blocking port 0 traffic to their clients [5,17,44].

We conducted additional analyses of traceroute responses, including differences in the last responsive hop, the number of responsive hops per trace, and ICMP types and codes. No significant differences were found between traceroutes using port 0 and those using other ports. These results are provided in Appendix A for interested readers.

### Summary of Findings

Our findings indicate that packets are handled differently based on the destination port number. Port 0 is more likely to be filtered along the path and at the target hosts. Notably, the phenomenon of fewer responses for TCP/0 is more common in IPv4 than in IPv6, possibly due to inconsistent firewall rules [14].

### Conclusion

In this study, we analyzed five complementary passive datasets and conducted active measurements to dissect port 0 traffic. We found that the majority of port 0 traffic flows between a small number of source and destination ASes/IP addresses. For some ASes, we observed similar diurnal patterns in port 0 traffic as with regular traffic, along with many TCP packets without flags, indicating fragmented traffic in the IXP dataset. Additionally, a significant portion of UDP port 0 traffic contains payload, with BitTorrent being a common contributor. TCP port 0 traffic, on the other hand, usually does not contain any payload and is mostly one-way, with two-way streams primarily identified as scanning traffic.

Through our active measurement campaign, we also discovered unusually high response rates to TCP port 0 probes in IPv4, as well as the presence of port 0 packet filtering.

### Additional Traceroute Analyses

#### Last Responsive Hops

We analyzed the last responsive hop of each trace, specifically focusing on the distance, i.e., the largest TTL value where an ICMP response was received. This allowed us to determine whether TCP/0 traceroutes are dropped earlier in the network. The left part of Figure 8 shows the distribution of the last responsive hop for IPv4 and IPv6. The only visible difference in IPv4 is the lower whiskers for TCP/0, which can be attributed to slightly more outliers with high TTLs for TCP/80 and TCP/443. For IPv6, TCP/0 has a median of 13, while TCP/80 and TCP/443 have a median of 14. Overall, the box plots show no significant difference in the last responsive hops based on the transport port.

#### Number of Responsive Hops

Next, we examined whether fewer routers on the path send ICMP messages for port 0 traceroute traffic. The right part of Figure 8 shows the box plot of the number of responsive hops, revealing no evidence of fewer ICMP responses for port 0 traffic. A slight reduction in TCP/443 ICMP responses per trace was observed in IPv4.

#### ICMP Types and Codes

Finally, we evaluated the different ICMP types and codes sent by routers. Figure 9 shows the distribution of type and code combinations for ICMP and ICMPv6. As expected, the majority are of type "Time to Live exceeded in Transit" for IPv4 and "hop limit exceeded in transit" for IPv6, with almost identical distributions for port 0 and other ports.

### Additional Passive Analysis

We analyzed hourly patterns of port 0 traffic grouped by source AS, comparing it with total port 80 traffic as a reference for regular traffic. Due to space limitations, the figure is available on our website: inet-port0.mpi-inf.mpg.de
