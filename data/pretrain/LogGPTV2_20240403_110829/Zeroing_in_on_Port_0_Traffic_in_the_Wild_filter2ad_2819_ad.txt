As the diﬀerence of reachable addresses is most apparent in IPv4, we inves-
tigate this phenomenon in more detail. We identify on a per-target basis the
addresses which see no responses in TCP/0, but do see responses in TCP/80.
These non-responsive port 0 addresses are mapped to 4102 distinct ASes, exhibit-
ing a long-tailed distribution. Next, we check whether we ﬁnd other addresses
in these 4102 ASes to be responsive to port 0 traceroutes, to exclude the pos-
sibility of missing responses due to ICMP rate limiting. We ﬁnd responses to
port 0 traceroutes for only 15 of these ASes, making up only 0.4% of the total
4102 ASes. This underlines the fact that these ASes are indeed handling port
0 traceroutes diﬀerently compared to other ports. Furthermore, as is shown in
Table 2, 9 out of the top 10 ASes belong to ISPs, further indicating that these
might be ASes blocking port 0 traﬃc to their clients [5,17,44]. We analyzed
many additional aspects of traceroute responses, by checking for diﬀerences in
the last responsive hop, comparing the number of responsive hops per trace,
evaluating ICMP types and codes, but ﬁnding no additional diﬀerences between
traceroutes using port 0 compared to other ports. We provide these results for
the interested reader in Appendix A.
To summarize, our ﬁndings show that packets are handled diﬀerently based
on the destination port number. Port 0 is more likely to be ﬁltered on the path
1 Note that due to the nature of traceroute measurements, missing traceroute
responses could stem either from ﬁltered packets on the forward path, rate-limiting
of ICMP packets at the routers, as well as dropping of ICMP responses on the return
path.

as well as at the target hosts. Interestingly, the phenomenon of fewer responses
for TCP/0 seems to be much more common in IPv4 compared to IPv6, which
could be due to inconsistent ﬁrewall rules [14].
7 Conclusion
In this work, we dissected port 0 traﬃc by analyzing ﬁve complementing passive
datasets and by conducting active measurements. We showed that the major-
ity of port 0 traﬃc in the wild ﬂows between a small number of source and
destination ASes/IP addresses. Moreover, for some ASes we identiﬁed similar
diurnal patterns in port 0 traﬃc as with regular traﬃc, along with many TCP
packets with no TCP ﬂags, hinting at a prevalence of fragmented traﬃc in the
IXP dataset. Additionally, we found that a major fraction of UDP port 0 traf-
ﬁc contains payload, with BitTorrent being a common contributor. Moreover,
we showed that TCP port 0 traﬃc usually does not contain any payload and
is mostly one-way. Two-way streams were identiﬁed as mostly scanning traﬃc.
Finally, by staging an active measurement campaign, we showed unusually high
response rates to TCP port 0 probes in IPv4, in addition to uncovering the
presence of port 0 packet ﬁltering.

A Additional Traceroute Analyses
We perform additional analyses for the active traceroute measurements, which
we provide in the following.
A.1
Last Responsive Hops
We analyze the last responsive hop of each trace speciﬁcally. More concretely,
we are interested in the distance, i.e., the largest TTL value of traceroutes,
where we get an ICMP response to. This allows us to determine whether TCP/0
traceroutes are e.g., dropped earlier in the network and therefore are terminated
earlier in the Internet.
Therefore, we compare the distribution of the last responsive hop. The left
part of Fig. 8 shows the distribution of the last responsive hop for IPv4 and IPv6,
respectively. The only visible diﬀerence we see for IPv4 are the lower whiskers for
TCP/0, stemming from the fact that TCP/80 and TCP/443 has slightly more
outliers with high TTLs when it comes to the last responsive hops. For IPv6 we
see that TCP/0 has a median of 13 and TCP/80 as well as TCP/443 have a
median last responsive hop TTL of 14. Since the median is almost identical, this
is due to the median only being able to represent integer values if all elements
560
A. Maghsoudlou et al.
(namely path lengths) are integers. TCP/0’s median is therefore “just below”
14 and the others’ median is “just above” 14. All in all, the box plots show that
there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence when analyzing last responsive hops depending
on the transport port.
Fig. 8. Box plot of last responsive hop (left) and the number of responsive hops (right)
aggregated by transport port protocol for IPv4 and IPv6 showing the median, ﬁrst and
third quantiles, mean ((cid:2)), and 1.5 times IQR as whiskers.
A.2 Number of Responsive Hops
Next, we try to answer the question whether fewer routers on the path send
ICMP messages for port 0 traceroute traﬃc or not.
In the right part of Fig. 8 we show the box plot of the number of responsive
hops. Again, we see no evidence of router sending fewer ICMP responses for
port 0 traﬃc. We see a slight reduction of TCP/443 ICMP responses per trace
in IPv4.
A.3
ICMP Types and Codes
Finally, we evaluate the diﬀerent ICMP types and codes sent by routers.
Figure 9 shows the distribution of type and code combinations for ICMP and
ICMPv6, respectively. As expected, the vast majority are of type “Time to Live
exceeded in Transit” for IPv4 and ‘hop limit exceeded in transit” for IPv6. We
see almost identical distributions for the port 0 and other ports.

B Additional Passive Analysis
We analyze hourly patterns of port 0 traﬃc grouped by source AS, compared
with the total port 80 traﬃc as a reference for regular traﬃc. Due to space
limitations we publish the ﬁgure on our website:
