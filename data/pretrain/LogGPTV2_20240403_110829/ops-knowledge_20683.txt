User: I have to label something in a "strong monotone increasing" fashion. Be it Invoice Numbers, shipping label numbers or the like.

A number MUST NOT BE used twice
Every number SHOULD BE used when exactly all smaller numbers have been used (no holes).

Fancy way of saying: I need to count 1,2,3,4 ...
The number Space I have available are typically 100.000 numbers and I need perhaps 1000 a day.
I know this is a hard Problem in distributed systems and often we are much better of with GUIDs. But in this case for legal reasons I need "traditional numbering".
Can this be implemented on Google AppEngine (preferably in Python)?
Assistant: I'm thinking in using the following solution: use CloudSQL (MySQL) to insert the records and assign the sequential ID (maybe with a Task Queue), later (using a Cron Task) move the records from CloudSQL back to the Datastore.
The entities also can have a UUID, so we can map the entities from the Datastore in CloudSQL, and also have the sequential ID (for legal reasons).
