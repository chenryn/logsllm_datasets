### Reputation Logs
These logs capture metadata about the presence of apps on 12 million Android devices, including parent-child installation relationships. We use VirusTotal (VT) to obtain antivirus (AV) labels for unwanted app classification and APK metadata such as permissions and certificate information.

### Dataset Coverage
The dataset includes devices from 243 country codes, covering nearly all countries in the world, with a few exceptions like North Korea. The top 15 countries by number of devices are shown in Table II, accounting for 89% of the devices. The distribution is long-tailed, with a skew towards North America, Europe, and Japan, where the security vendor has a larger market share. Some large-population countries like China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Bangladesh are underrepresented, but we still have tens of thousands of devices in China and several thousand in the rest.

The dataset includes devices from over 3,000 vendors. Table III shows the top 15 vendors. Samsung is the dominant vendor with over 40% of the devices, followed by Xiaomi (8.6%) and Motorola (7.0%). The distribution is also long-tailed, with only 14 vendors having more than 1% of the devices.

### Data Collection and Processing
Each device regularly queries a cloud-based reputation system to obtain the reputation score for installed APKs. The query includes file metadata such as APK hash, package name, signer key, and optionally the parent package name. The response includes a reputation score used by the AV engine to determine the APK's status. To remove duplicated events, we obtain the earliest date when each unique tuple (device identifier, APK SHA256 hash, package name, signer key, parent package name) was queried. The dataset comprises 2.3 billion unique events with 34.6 million APKs from 7.9 million packages using 4.1 million certificate chains.

### Parent-Child Relationships
The AV client queries the Android Package Installer to obtain the parent package name for each installed APK. If the parent package is known, it is included in the reputation query. However, some parent packages might be unknown, such as pre-installed apps or sideloaded apps via ADB. Of the 2.3 billion unique events, 75% correspond to installations, 24% to updates, and 1% have no parent package information. The 1.7 billion install events contain 5.4K parent (installer) packages and 2.8M child packages.

### VirusTotal Integration
We query the hash of APKs in VirusTotal (VT), an online service that analyzes files and URLs using multiple security tools. VT returns file metadata and detection labels. Due to API restrictions, we could not query all 34.6 million APKs. We queried all parent APKs that performed at least one installation, the 10 most prevalent APKs for each signer, all APKs with negative reputation, and a subset of APKs with positive reputation. This resulted in VT reports for 4.6 million APKs. We use the AV labels in the VT reports for unwanted app identification and classification. Since we only have VT reports for 13% of all APKs, our results provide a lower bound for unwanted app prevalence.

### Play Market Analysis
We check if an app found in user devices is available in the official Android Play market by downloading its public webpage using the app’s package name. We queried all 7.9 million package names in February 2020, and 24% (1.9 million) were present in the Play market at that time. The rest may be distributed through alternative channels or come pre-installed.

## Approach
### Data Challenges
#### Obtaining Parent Information
The reputation logs contain the package name of the parent APK but not its hash or public key. To avoid misattribution, we scan all reputation queries from a device during the four months, extracting those that queried an APK with the same package name as the parent. We sort these queries by decreasing time difference from the install event and assign the APK’s hash and public key from the closest event as the parent. This procedure recovers parent information for 24% (412.6 million) of the install events, covering 78% of the installer packages and 57% of the child packages.

#### Identifying Platform Keys
To identify platform keys, we first obtain a list of 65 package names from the AOSP repository. We search for keys that sign `com.android.phone` and at least ten AOSP packages. For each candidate key, we identify the top 10 packages signed by the key. If at least half of these packages are in the AOSP list, we keep the key. We also examine the certificate information and keep the key if the subject DN mentions a specific vendor. Using this procedure, we identified 201 platform keys belonging to 80 device vendors or OS publishers, appearing in over 6 million (50%) devices.

#### Installer Categorization
We manually classify installers into 12 categories: the official Play market, alternative markets, browsers, commercial PPI, backup and restore, IM, theme stores, file managers, file sharing apps, bloatware, mobile device management (MDM), and package installers. Bloatware includes apps signed by a device vendor or carrier with unclear functionality. MDM apps enable corporate mobile device administration. Package installers include implementations of Android’s Package Installer module and third-party APK installers. We also add an "Other" category for apps that do not fit the 12 expected distribution vectors.

## Unwanted Apps
### Prevalence
We measure the prevalence of unwanted apps on user devices, defined as the fraction of user devices that had an unwanted app encounter over the four-month analysis period. We use VT detection labels to identify unwanted apps, considering any file flagged by at least a threshold number of AV engines. We could not query all 34.6 million APKs due to VT API restrictions, but collected VT reports for 13% (4.6 million) of all APKs. The number of unwanted APKs decreases as the threshold increases.

Using a threshold of t=4, there are 3.0 million unwanted APKs, and the prevalence is 18.3%. This estimate is conservative, as it considers benign all APKs not queried to VT, not found in VT, or flagged by less than four AV products. Among the devices with at least one unwanted app encounter at t=4, the median is 2.0 unwanted apps per device (avg=5.0, std=1497.0).

Table IV provides the split between malware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs). At t=4, 60% of the unwanted APKs are considered PUPs, and 40% are malware. Malware prevalence (11.2% of all 12 million devices) is almost the same as PUP prevalence (11.1%), indicating the presence of high-prevalence malware. The devices typically encounter only malware or PUPs, but 490,000 devices encounter both types.

## Conclusion
This section reports on unwanted app encounters affecting the 12 million devices in the full reputation logs. The next section will measure the prevalence of unwanted apps on the user devices.
