User: For a distributed system, how to perform load balancing and fault tolerance?
Assistant: Load balancing: 1. Based on DNS implementation, by returning multiple IP addresses in DNS resolution, the client randomly selects an IP address to access each time, thereby achieving load balancing. 2. Based on reverse proxy implementation, a dedicated server is used as a reverse proxy server to distribute user requests to multiple servers behind. 3. Based on automatic management tools, such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesos, etc., service discovery and automatic load balancing can be realized by setting load balancing rules. Fault-tolerant processing: 1. Redundant design, the backup mechanism can be used in the distributed system, when the main machine fails, it can automatically switch to the backup machine to ensure the availability of the system. 2. Pre-judgment retry, such as setting the number of retries and the retry interval, and automatically retry when an exception occurs. 3. Automatic timeout processing, when the request response exceeds the set threshold, the processing will fail. 4. Flow control, such as using a flow-limiting algorithm (token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm) to control flow to prevent system crashes. 5. Adaptive adjustment of resources, the distributed system can monitor the status of the system, automatically adjust the corresponding resources, and adjust to the optimal resource allocation.
