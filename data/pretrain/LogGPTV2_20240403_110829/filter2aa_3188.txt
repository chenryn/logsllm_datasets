### Penetration Testing at Intelguardians
I work for Intelguardians, a security consulting firm, where I lead and conduct network and application penetration testing. A typical penetration test addresses the compound question: can a "hacker" break in from the Internet, and how far can they go? The most challenging part is gaining access to the internal network. Once inside, the task becomes significantly easier.

#### Target: Internal Network
Our penetration tests become much simpler once we gain access to the internal network. Most organizations have firewalls configured for three zones: Internet, DMZ, and Internal networks. From any machine within the internal network, we usually have extensive access.

### A Curious Trend in Ethical Hacking
Over the past year, we've noticed that compromising Internet-accessible servers has become increasingly difficult. Instead, we often gain access to the internal network via client-side attacks, exploiting vulnerabilities in browsers, mail clients, Acrobat, and Office programs of Security or IT staff. These attacks have become easier with tools like Core IMPACT, Metasploit, and other attacker toolkits.

#### Case Study: Hacking Acrobat Reader
In a recent penetration test, we were allowed to target only one IT Security person. Despite using IE7 and being well-patched, we managed to compromise his machine by exploiting a vulnerability in Acrobat Reader. This single exploit was enough to provide us with the necessary foothold.

### Professional Hackers and Client-Side Attacks
Real attackers have been using client-side attacks for years, driven by the financial incentives in hacking. This has led to the creation of botnets, which are used to manage large numbers of compromised systems. Botnet owners often do not even inventory the machines they control, leading to situations where high-profile targets, such as Congressional computers, can be part of a botnet without significant consequences.

#### Penetration Testers and Workstation Control
As targeted attackers, penetration testing teams use these compromised machines to gain access to file shares, cached credentials, and applications that may lack robust security. Even the largest organizations often lack filters across their worldwide WAN, making it easier for us to move laterally within the network.

### Social Engineering and User Responsibility
Initially, the security community attributes these attacks to social engineering and blames the user. However, not all exploits require user interaction, and some users will inevitably be fooled. Blaming non-IT users is unfair; they should not need to understand vulnerabilities to use email. It is our responsibility as IT architects to train and protect users, especially those in high-value targets like mortgage brokers and dentists who may lack IT support and training.

### Challenges in Protecting Workstations
Most organizations focus on perimeter and firewall security, with efforts primarily aimed at protecting servers. While this approach has made server-based attacks more difficult, attackers have shifted to targeting workstation PCs. This shift presents several challenges:

1. **Numbers**: Attackers only need to find one vulnerable workstation out of thousands.
2. **Network Disconnection**: Users can remain disconnected or powered off, complicating patch management.
3. **Patch Management**: Many organizations lack comprehensive patch management, especially for third-party products.

#### Vulnerability Assessments
Most organizations perform vulnerability assessments infrequently and focus on servers. However, client-side software often identifies itself, providing opportunities for detection. Tools like Master Reconnaissance Tool (MR-T) and Metagoofill can help identify and assess vulnerabilities in browser plugins and document metadata.

### Client-side Intrusion Prevention
To address these challenges, we have developed a new free tool called Client-side IPS. Available at [http://www.ClientIPS.org](http://www.ClientIPS.org), this tool works as an inline transparent proxy. If a browser requests an external website while revealing significant vulnerabilities, the tool can redirect it to a captive patch portal. Similar measures can be applied to other protocols, such as denying access to mailboxes for vulnerable mail clients and injecting explanatory messages.
