differs in several respects. We find that the wireless side channel is
as susceptible to a website fingerprinting attack as the traditional
wired side channel. We also sample at 700Hz rather than 250kHz,
allowing our attack to be performed by less sophisticated hardware
and be more difficult to detect. Additionally, our classifier can ef-
fectively classify current traces from different device and charger
models without any preprocessing.
The combination of hardware and sensor functionality on mobile
devices leaves them susceptible to some unique side-channel attacks.
Yan et al. [42] established a general exploitation approach for a
variety of power side-channel attacks on an Android smartphone.
While our attack is based on this model, we also demonstrate it on
an Apple iPhone and do not require a wired connection, only the
physical proximity required to wirelessly charge.
Matyunin et al. [27] successfully identify the application running
on a phone by studying how CPU operations affect magnetometer
measurements. Yang et al. [43] showed that the transition between
running apps leaves a side channel in memory that can be used
to determine what application was executing. Lifshits et al. [23]
installed a malicious, power monitoring battery in a smartphone
to identify various types of activity. Qin et al. [32] also adopt a
similar approach to smartphone website fingerprinting by using
a malicious application that estimates the fluctuation of power
data. The power estimation model employs CPU data that can be
accessed without permission in Android 7. In contrast to these
works, our work does not require a malicious app or an otherwise
compromised phone, because the act of wireless charging itself is
vulnerable regardless of permissions set by the operating system.
Another method of website classification besides power side
channels is through traffic and hardware analysis. In contrast to
these works, our attack can occur without any software permis-
sions at all. Hintz [16], Hayes and Danezis [15], and Lu et al. [25]
measured the amount of encrypted data being transferred and other
metadata to identify webpages even in the face of website finger-
printing defenses. Based on this work, Al-Shehari and Zhioua [3]
proposed a unified model for traffic analysis attacks on computers.
Our work also examines the Alexa top sites list [17] but differs in
that the side channel exists locally on the phone’s hardware, and is
not a result of Internet traffic characteristics.
9 CONCLUSION
This paper presents a new side-channel attack that occurs when a
Qi-compatible smart device is wirelessly charging and the power
consumption of the wireless transmitter is recorded. We use a low-
cost device to collect current traces and infer private information
such as browser activity. We demonstrate that this attack can occur
even if the user’s phone is not fully charged, requires no permission
from the phone OS or user, and can occur even if the acquired
current trace is as short as 2.5 seconds. While this work explores
a new side channel present in all wireless charging compatible
smart devices, the entire scope and constraints of the wireless
charging side-channel attack and useful countermeasures need to
be researched in future work.
