Assistant: To use Terraform to automatically create an AWS EC2 instance, the following steps need to be completed: 1. Install Terraform: Install the Terraform tool on the local machine, and you can download the appropriate installer from the Terraform official website. 2. Configure the AWS access key: Create an account through the AWS IAM service, create an access key for the account, and keep this key. Then on your local machine, set the access key by setting an environment variable or in Terraform's AWS provider configuration. 3. Create a Terraform configuration file: On the local machine, create a Terraform configuration file that defines the configuration of the AWS EC2 instance. 4. Initialize Terraform: On the local machine, use the Terraform command to initialize the configuration file, and execute the following command: terraform init 5. Execute Terraform plan: On the local machine, use the Terraform command to plan to detect and estimate changes to create instances and cost information. Execute the following command: terraform plan 6. Apply the Terraform plan: On the local machine, use the Terraform command to formally apply the plan to create an AWS EC2 instance. Execute the following command: terraform apply 7. Verify the instance: On the AWS console, verify that the creation of the EC2 instances was successful and ensure they are functioning as expected. In this way, a set of AWS EC2 instances can be created automatically using Terraform. The creation process of instances can be customized more flexibly through features such as modules and variables provided by Terraform.
