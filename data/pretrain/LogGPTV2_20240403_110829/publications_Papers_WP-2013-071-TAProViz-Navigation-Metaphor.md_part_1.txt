1 Introduction
The last decade has seen substantial progresses in the development of workflow
management systems (WfMS). Nonetheless, mobility was overlooked. Systems
were mainly confined to organizational ’firewalls’. IBM WebSphere MQ Work-
flow, Oracle BPM Suite, SAP NetWeaver BPM, etc. are all major enterprise
systems which function in hermetic organizational ecosystems (see [1]).
To address this gap in the field of mobility, our approach consisted on find-
ing a metaphor to derive new paradigms for WfMS to support mobility. The
importance of metaphors in systems development has long been identified as a
catalystforthesuccessofinformationsystems[9].Inourwork,wearguethatthe

this familiar system of everyday experience to the operation of mobile workflow
management systems to ease understanding of its structure and functionality
[8]. More precisely, we explore the familiar features of car navigation systems
as a catalyst to foster process navigation by establishing an analogy between
networks of roads and the graph structure of a process. For instance, we map
the well-known situation of driving into a dead-end road with the existence of
a logical deadlock in a process instance. The need for more TomTom-like func-
tionalities for WfMS to make systems more user-friendly was first identified in
[12].ManymappingsbetweenTomTomandworkflowmanagementsystemsmay
be derived, e.g., by creating interpretations of traffic symbols in the context of
workflow management - some of which will be shown in Section 2.1. It became
clearthatitwasabenefittothinkaboutmetaphorsratherthantosimplyfollow

To better convey our goal, Figure 1 shows a mockup of a car navigation

at what time the instance is expected to be completed; the speedometer was
replaced by the current cost of the process (see label (4)); and label (5) marks a
road selection in a highway which indicates a path selection (i.e. an XOR-split)
in the process model. Naturally, the design of a high-fidelity prototype for the
mockup of Figure 1 would not include all graphical elements. For example, the
skyline may not find a correspondence in mobile workflow applications.

2 Process model navigation
Most traditional process models are based on a graph-based representation for
specifying how a business process or workflow operates. Let us use Petri nets to
model processes. The question to be asked is “how can we establish an analogy
between a Petri net and a geographic map in the context of a car navigation
metaphor?”. We established the following fundamental mappings:
– Process models correspond to geographic maps
– Process instances correspond to moving vehicles
– Process places correspond to route sections and intersections
– Process transitions correspond to routes
Inotherwords,aprocessmodel(i.e.agraph)whichlinksplaceswithtransi-
tions,definingamoreorlessorderedpattern,isdescribableintermsofanetwork

resent lead to the same place. Since processes are essentially planar structures,
the corresponding route network has a two-dimensional structure. We use the
term route as an abstraction concept to refer to a street, highway, road, etc.
By analyzing the features that can be implemented for process navigation
using a car navigation metaphor, we created a taxonomy of three important
concepts to be considered: topology, connectivity, and landmarks.
2.1 Topology
Thetopology,orstructure,ofaprocesscontainsspecificelements(suchassplits
and joins) which can find a mapping counterpart in a car navigation metaphor.
Letususetheworkflowpatternsidentifiedin[13]asastartingpointandanalyze
how they can be matched to a split road, a road junction, a traffic light, a dead
end, a roundabout and the notion of distance.
– Split road. An exclusive choice (XOR-split) and a multi-choice (OR-split) can
be represented with a split road, i.e. a point where a flow of traffic splits.
See Figure 2.a) for a possible road sign to use to represent a process split.
A parallel split (AND-split) can be represented with various parallel lanes
running in the same direction (see Figure 1, label (5)).
– Road junction. The process synchronization pattern (AND-join) and the sim-
ple merge (XOR-join) can all be represented with a road junction, i.e. a place
where two or more roads meet.

– Traffic light. The structured synchronizing merge (OR-join sync) can be ef-
fectively illustrated with a traffic light. When an instance stops at a traffic
light,userscanimmediatelyunderstandthatasynchronizationpointhasbeen
reached (see Figure 2.b).
– Dead end. A process with a deadlock, i.e. a situation where an instance can-
not continue to be executed anymore, can be made graphically visible in a
navigation system using the road dead end sign (see Figure 2.c).
– Roundabout. Many cyclic process models include small repetitive cycles for
errorcheckingorqualityimprovements.Thesesmallcyclescomposedofafew
transitions can be made explicit and be represented using a roundabout sign
(see Figure 2.d).
– Distance. Route networks are spatially extended webs. It is possible to work
with two types of distance measures: topological and geometrical. Topolog-
ical route length is computed from the number of nodes (i.e. transitions or
places) of a path; while the geometrical length is the sum of the lengths of all
transitions of a path.

2.2 Connectivity
Connectivityexploresprocesstransitions(i.e.tasks)thatconnectplaces.Ingeo-
graphicalmaps,connectivityisexpressedusingstreets,avenues,highways,walk-
ingpaths,etc.Routescanbeusedtoportraythestaticnatureofprocessmodels
and the dynamic behavior of process instances. For example,
– Route type. The frequency a transition is executed in the context of a pro-
cess instance or in the context of several instances can be represented using
different types of routes. For example, a transition which is rarely executed
can be represented using a dirty road; a transition with an average number
of invocations can be represented with a lane; and a highway can be used to
indicate frequently executed transitions.
– Route failure. Often a process transition can stop functioning due to an un-
derlying problem in the information system that supports it (e.g. database
failure, incorrect login/password, Web service invocation error, etc.). In such
a case, the failure can be illustrated in real-time as a route being interrupted
by landslides.

– Multiple lanes. The workflow parallel split pattern (i.e. an AND-split) in-
troduces the concurrent execution of two of more instances which were split
at some point. This concurrent execution can be visualized using additional
routes which are parallel to the one followed by an instance.
– Routenames.Sinceroutesrepresenttransitions,arouteinheritsitsnamefrom
the transition it represents (see Figure 1, label (1)). This is static information
associated with a process model, rather than with dynamic instances.
– Route duration/cost. For the duration of routes (i.e. transitions), the research
doneinthecontextofWorkflowQoS(QualityofService)[2]canbeappliedto
enable each route to have a duration model. Quantitatively, the elapsed time
or remaining duration of a route can be mapped to a concept similar to the
one of physical distance in kilometers.
In these five examples, transitions and routes represent the static nature of
designtimeprocesses.Whileroutescharacteristicsrepresentthedynamicnature
of processes instances.
2.3 Landmark
In a map some aspects are more relevant than others. For example, Points Of
Interests (POI) indicate places which are worth visiting. The notion of land-
mark brings the notion of frequency, clustering, and containment for process
navigation.
– Frequency. To express the importance of a place, which is often visited by
process instances, a POI can be used. For example, an airport can illustrate
a busy place where many instances flow.
– Clustering. Navigation maps identify areas which aggregate similar elements.
For example, a city clusters similar roads (usually streets). In the same way,
the elements of a process can also be clustered based, for example, on the
similarityoftransitions.Thesizeofclusterscanthenberepresenteddifferently
to express their relevance.
– Containment. Processes are often built by relying on subprocesses which de-
fine containment relationships. The notion of a process which contains sub-
processes, which in turn contains yet another subprocess, can be expressed
by using a linear hierarchy of city → town → village or alternatively, country
→ state → county. As instances ’travel’ from a process to a subprocess, the
navigation system can change the visualization context.
Implementing frequency, clustering, and containment using a semantic layer
of information can provide environments characterized by intuitive clues (e.g.
POI, cities, and towns) to the static and dynamic structure of processes.
2.4 Limitations
On the one hand, the use of metaphors has the advantage of enabling users to
reapply the knowledge they already have from a domain. On the other hand,
6 Jorge Cardoso et al.
a metaphor might involve the danger that it does not go far enough and that
certain characteristics cannot be well supported. For example, while Section 2.1
suggests multiple lanes to be interpreted as a parallel split, the analogy maybe
hard to understand and implement. Since there are multiple lanes, one needs to
be selected. It is not possible to drive on multiple lines in parallel. One solution
can be to duplicate the ”car” in different lanes simultaneously. Naturally, this
scenario does not typically happens in real life. In a parallel split, the need to
represent activities executing asynchronously is also a requirement.
To reduce complexity, navigation can be combined with process view mech-
anisms to enable, e.g., zooming in/out by aggregating/removing parts of the
process. Similarly, views can be used to provide personalized versions of a pro-
cess omitting activities not relevant to the current ”driver” (see Section 2.3).
3 Prevalidation of the approach
Thevalidationoftheproposedprocessmodelnavigationmetaphor,aswithmost
information systems, can be subdivided into prevalidation, primary validation,
andpostvalidation.Inthispaper,wewillbeconcernedwithprevalidation.This
first phase is carried out before implementing any prototype or running system
[3].
We have used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)[4] for empirically
prevalidatingthenavigationmetaphor.TAMhasbeenusedsuccessfullyinmany
studiesformorethantwodecadestotestthepotentialadoptionofnewinforma-
tion systems by end users. Despite the fact that several other models have also
been proposed to predict the future use of a system, TAM has captured most
attention from the information systems community.
TAM suggests that perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use
(PEOU) are beliefs about a new technology that influence an individual’s at-
titude toward use (ATU) of that technology. In addition, the model postulates
that the attitude toward using a new technology has a mediating effect on be-
havioral intention (BI) to use.
TAMusesasurveymethodtoinquireendusersabouttheirperceptionlevels
(see sections 3.1 and 3.2). Afterwards, survey data is collected (section 3.3) and
descriptive and inferential analysis techniques are performed, typically, using
softwarepackagesforstatisticalanalysissuchasSPSSorSAS(section3.4).The
final step is to interpret statistical results to determine if a constructed model
can predict that a new technology will be adopted, or not, by end users (section
3.4).
