Communication from the Commission to the European Par-
liament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and 
the Committee of the Regions, A comprehensive approach on 
personal data protection in the European Union, COM(2010) 
609 final of November 4, 2010. This approach has been re-
peatedly reiterated by members of the European Commis-
sion, for example by EU justice commissioner Viviane Red-
ing in a speech to the European parliament on March 16, 2011.

42	 In the form proposed by the European Union, the 
right to be forgotten cannot easily render a substan-
tial contribution to an improvement of data protec-
tion. The concept is probably too vague to be suc-
cessful. History has shown that human rights need 
to be embedded in strategies, and such strategies 
have to be actually used.100 Consequently, a clearer 
picture of the actual objective of a new fundamen-
tal right is necessary. The proclamation of a right to 
be forgotten as such does not suffice. It recalls the 
myth of Pandora’s box: Impelled by her natural curi-
osity, Pandora opened the box and all the evils con-
tained in it escaped. Moreover, a concretization of 
the right to be forgotten might be achieved by more 
specific codes of conduct, such as the French “Code 
of Good Practice on the Right to Be Forgotten on 
Social Networks and Search Engines,” encompass-
ing practical commitments that could become the 
starting point for a future international memoran-
dum or agreement.101 
43	 The right to be forgotten must be complemented 
with legal instruments to guide individuals and en-
tities on how to apply data protection principles on 
the basis of the acknowledgement of rightholders’ 
autonomy. Together with such guidelines, account-
ability mechanisms need to be introduced and audit 
procedures should be established.102 Possible means 
could be privacy marks or seals from a self-regula-
tory regime, which would then be monitored by es-
tablished data controllers according to accountabil-
ity procedures applied by the program or scheme 
organization. Such an “evaluation” also corresponds 
to the democratic theory that holds governing bod-
ies accountable in responding to the public’s inter-
est.103 This would enable technical measures to be 
introduced much faster than legal instruments, and 
the technical measures would have a global scope of 
application that is not limited by geography.104 Re-
turning to Pandora’s situation: By the time she man-
aged to close the lid, nearly the entire contents had 
escaped. Only one last thing lay at the bottom, and 
that was hope.

(Zurich) and Prof. Anne Cheung (Hong Kong) for their valu-

Blog discussions about the French and EU approach for in-
troducing a new human right seem to use the two terms 
synonymously.
Substantively, this right concerns data retention and the as-
pect of the expiration of the data life (see infra C. III. 1).
