User: Hey, i was wondering if there is a way to enforce the 30 seconds limit that is being enforced online at the appengine production servers to the local dev server? its impossible to test if i reach the limit before going production.
maybe some django middlware?
Assistant: It's possible, as Alex demonstrates, but it's not really a good idea: The performance characteristics of the development server are not the same as those of the production environment, so something that executes quickly locally may not be nearly as quick in production, and vice versa.
Also, your user facing tasks should definitely not be so slow as to approach the 30 second limit.
