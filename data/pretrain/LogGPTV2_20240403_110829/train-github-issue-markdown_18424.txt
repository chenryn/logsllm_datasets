Today I've upgraded our codebase from r88 -> r91, everything seems to work
fine aside from the reflectors (code which has not significantly changed since
r88 from what I see). I've noticed that when checking individual upgrades, the
problem starts at r90.
It seems to go exponentially bad when our entire model + mirror are in the
frustrum, when I'm right in front of it & little else of the model, the
performance is OK. Now since I can't provide live examples, I was wondering if
someone could point me on where to look/investigate, or what could have
changed in that release that affects them?
