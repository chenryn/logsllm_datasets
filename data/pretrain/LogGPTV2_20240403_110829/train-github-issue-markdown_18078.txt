Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I have two code snippets that produce different results, even though the input lists are identical. The code and results are as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Using numpy
print(np.std([766897346, 766897346, 766897346, 766897346, 766897346,
              766897346, 766897346, 766897346, 766897346, 766897346]))
# Output: 0

# Using pandas
print(pd.Series([766897346, 766897346, 766897346, 766897346, 766897346,
                 766897346, 766897346, 766897346, 766897346, 766897346]).std(ddof=0))
# Output: 10.119288512538814
```

The two lists are identical, but the results are quite different. I believe the result from pandas must be incorrect. I am using pandas version 0.16.2 with Python 3.4.

Could you please explain why this discrepancy occurs? Is it a bug?
