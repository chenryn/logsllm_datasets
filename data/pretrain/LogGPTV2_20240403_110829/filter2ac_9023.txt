### Title: Black Hat US-19: Process Injection Techniques - Gotta Catch Them All

#### Abstract:
In the realm of Windows process injection, it was commonly believed that only 6-7 fundamental techniques existed. However, our research, initiated in late 2018, revealed a much more extensive landscape. We identified and analyzed over 20 distinct techniques, which we meticulously collected from various sources, including websites, blogs, and academic papers. This led us to question the existence of a comprehensive, definitive collection of "Windows process injection" techniques.

In this presentation, we present the most comprehensive and up-to-date collection of Windows process injection techniques. This is the first resource to cover all (or nearly all) true injection methods, with a focus on Windows 10 x64. Specifically, we examine injections from one running 64-bit medium integrity process to another, without privilege elevation. We also highlight the impact of new Windows protection technologies, such as Control Flow Guard (CFG) and Code Integrity Guard (CIG).

Our approach differentiates between memory write primitives and execution techniques, and we discuss various memory allocation strategies. Each technique in our collection has been curated, analyzed, and tabulated, with straightforward, research-grade Proof of Concepts (PoCs). We have tested each method against Windows 10 x64, both with and without protection mechanisms, and provide detailed reports on the requirements, limitations, and unique characteristics of each technique.

Additionally, no Black Hat presentation would be complete without introducing new attacks. We present a novel memory writing primitive that is agnostic to CFG. We also introduce a new "stack bombing" execution method, based on the aforementioned memory write primitive, which is inherently safe despite the inherent risks associated with stack overwriting.

Finally, we offer a mix-and-match library of all memory write primitives and execution methods, enabling users to create custom, "tailor-made" process injections tailored to their specific needs.
