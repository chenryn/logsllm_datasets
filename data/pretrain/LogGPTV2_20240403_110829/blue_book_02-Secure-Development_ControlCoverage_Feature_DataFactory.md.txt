## IMPORTANT: DevOps Kit (AzSK) is being sunset by the end of FY21. For more details, see [here](../../../ReleaseNotes/AzSKSunsetNotice.md).

### Data Factory Security Controls and Rationale

| **Control** | **Description & Rationale** | **Severity** | **Automated Fix Script Available?** | **Fix Implemented?** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Linked Service Encryption in Transit** | Use HTTPS to ensure server/service authentication and protect data in transit from man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking attacks. | High | Yes | No |
| **Minimum Required Permissions for User Accounts/Roles** | Granting minimum access ensures that users have just enough permissions to perform their tasks, minimizing the exposure of resources in case of a user or service account compromise. | Medium | No | No |
| **Data Management Gateway (DMG) on a Locked-Down Machine** | The DMG serves as a gateway into the corporate environment, allowing cloud endpoints to access enterprise data. Using a locked-down, secure baseline configuration ensures that this machine does not become an entry point to downstream data servers/services. | Medium | No | No |
| **Secure Registration of Data Management Gateway (DMG)** | The DMG tool is required to connect to data sources behind a firewall. It must be installed and registered on a machine with access to the data source. The gateway key exchange between Azure Portal and the DMG tool should be done via PowerShell to minimize operational risk. | Medium | No | No |
| **Periodic Rotation of Data Gateway Key** | Periodic key rotation is a good security practice, as it minimizes the likelihood of data loss/compromise due to key theft, brute-forcing, or recovery attacks. | Medium | No | No |
| **Service Account for Linked Service with DMG** | Using a service account with access to the data tier eliminates the need to manage a separate account/connection string that the DMG would otherwise need to use to access the backend data. | Medium | No | No |
| **Enable Monitoring for Azure Data Factory** | Auditing enables log collection of important system events relevant to security. Regular monitoring of audit logs can help detect suspicious and malicious activity early and respond in a timely manner. | Medium | No | No |
| **Service-to-Service Authentication for Data Lake Store Linked Service** | If user credentials are used, there may be downtime due to token expiration. Service-to-service authentication ensures high availability. | High | No | No |
| **High Availability Configuration for DMG** | Configuring multiple nodes for the DMG ensures that another node is available to move data even if one node goes down. | High | No | No |
| **Encrypted Node-to-Node Communication for Multi-Node Gateway** | Use HTTPS to ensure server/service authentication and protect data in transit from man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking attacks. | High | No | No |
| **Backup of DMG Configurations** | Keeping a backup of DMG configurations ensures that there is always a previous snapshot available for quick restoration during a recovery scenario. | Medium | No | No |
| **Encrypted Credentials in Linked Service** | By using this configuration, credentials will be transmitted in encrypted format to the DMG, ensuring that on-premise data sources are accessible only through the DMG, which can decrypt the credentials. | High | No | No |
| **Fault Tolerance in Copy Activity** | In case of incompatible data, a fault-tolerant configuration helps continue the copy activity by skipping and logging incorrect data, rather than aborting the activity. | Medium | No | No |

This table provides a clear and organized overview of the security controls, their descriptions, rationale, severity, and whether automated fix scripts are available or if the fix has been implemented.
