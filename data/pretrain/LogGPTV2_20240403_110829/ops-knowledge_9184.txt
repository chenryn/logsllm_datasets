Question: A developer is building a mobile application that requires secure authorization to access a web service. Which OAuth grant type would be the most secure and appropriate choice for this type of client application?
"A": "Authorization Code without PKCE, because mobile applications are considered public clients.",
"B": "Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), since it enhances the security of the Authorization Code grant for use by public clients such as mobile applications.",
"C": "Implicit Flow, as it is designed specifically for client-side applications to retrieve access tokens quickly.",
"D": "Device Code, as it is intended for applications that operate on devices with limited input capabilities."
Answer: B
