### Expected Behavior:
it should be a success
### Steps To Reproduce:
  * remove any "cache" config
  * `npm publish` on a working project
### Environment:
wsl archlinux  
node v15.11.0  
npm v7.6.1
### workaround
adding "cache":"~/.npm" in package.json solves the problem.
### fix
I guess list[0] here is supposed to be the default config... but for any
reason is not resolved... but I may be wrong here.
I also notice https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/lib/utils/flat-
options.js#L50 is the only flatten option that is supposed not to be defined :
maybe the problem is there ?
Might be related to this change (the code was ` cache:
join(npm.config.get('cache'), '_cacache'),` before, maybe get use default
value if any ?
