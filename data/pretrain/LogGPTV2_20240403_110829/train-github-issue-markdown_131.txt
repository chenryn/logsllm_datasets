### Current Behavior
When running `npm publish`, the following error occurs:

```

```

### Expected Behavior
The `npm publish` command should complete successfully without any errors.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Remove any "cache" configuration.
2. Run `npm publish` on a working project.

### Environment
- WSL ArchLinux
- Node.js version: v15.11.0
- npm version: v7.6.1

### Workaround
Adding `"cache": "~/.npm"` to the `package.json` file resolves the issue.

### Potential Cause and Fix
It appears that the `list[0]` value, which is supposed to be the default configuration, is not being resolved correctly. This may be due to an issue in the `flatten` function at the following line:
```javascript
https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/lib/utils/flat-options.js#L50
```
This is the only `flatten` option that is expected to be undefined, which might be the root cause of the problem.

Additionally, this issue might be related to a recent change in the code. Previously, the cache configuration was set as follows:
```javascript
cache: join(npm.config.get('cache'), '_cacache'),
```
It's possible that the current implementation does not properly handle the default value if it is not explicitly defined.

### Suggested Solution
Ensure that the `cache` configuration is always provided, either by setting a default value or by ensuring that the `npm.config.get('cache')` call returns a valid string.
