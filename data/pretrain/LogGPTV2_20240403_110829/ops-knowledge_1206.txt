User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 analyze_event 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks whether the query related table has undergone an analyzing operation. If the table structure is not available, it is not a root cause. Otherwise, it calculates the probable time interval for the analyzing operation and creates a dictionary of table names and their corresponding analyze times. It then checks whether the analyze time falls within the slow SQL instance's start and end time or within the probable time interval before or after the slow SQL instance. If any table satisfies these conditions, it is considered a root cause and added to the 'analyze' key in the detail dictionary. Finally, the function returns True if there is at least one table in the 'analyze' key, otherwise it is not a root cause.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- table_structure
- slow_sql_param
- analyze_delay
- start_at
- duration_time
