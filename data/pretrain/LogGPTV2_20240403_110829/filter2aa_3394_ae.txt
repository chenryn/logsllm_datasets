overlays.  As a result, the scalability of the conventional overlay of a hybrid system is expected to
be the same as in a conventional system.  In the trunked overlay, as in a stand-alone trunked
system, the control software and the intelligence it confers give it a greater flexibility to
accommodate upgrades.
5.7
Network Encryption
Network encryption must be implemented if users require a heightened level of security
against advanced interceptors. With the current technological advances, digital encryption is the
standard.  Digital voice encryption requires that the analog voice signal be sampled, digitized,
encrypted, transmitted, and decrypted in real-time.
Standard network encryption schemes are available on all types of LMR systems.
Encryption is independent of system type and architecture.  Four types of encryption products
and algorithms are deployed in the United States:
• Type 1 - A classified or controlled cryptographic item endorsed by the National
Security Agency for securing classified and sensitive U.S. Government information.
Note: The term refers only to products, and not to information, key, services, or
controls.  Type 1 products contain classified National Security Agency algorithms.
They are available to U.S. Government users, their contractors, and federally
sponsored non-U.S. Government activities subject to export restrictions in accordance
with International Traffic in Arms Regulation. [7]
• Type 2 - Unclassified cryptographic equipment, assembly, or component, endorsed by
the National Security Agency, for use in telecommunications and automated
information systems for the protection of national security information.  Note: The
term refers only to products, and not to information, key, services, or controls.  Type 2
products may not be used for classified information, but contain classified National
Security Agency algorithms that distinguish them from products containing the
unclassified data algorithm.  Type 2 products are subject to export restrictions in
accordance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation. [7]
• Type 3 - A cryptographic algorithm that has been registered by the National Institute
of Standards and Technology and published as a Federal Information Processing
Standard for use in protecting unclassified sensitive information or commercial
information. [7]
• Type 4 - An unclassified cryptographic algorithm that has been registered by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology, but is not a Federal Information
Processing Standard. [7]
There are potential drawbacks to using encryption on an analog LMR system.  In analog
systems, when portables or mobiles are used in encrypted mode, the radio coverage can be
decreased compared to operation in clear or unencrypted mode due to quantization noise.
Estimates by users indicate that an encrypted analog transmitter station’s range can be limited by
as much as 30 percent.  Because encrypted signals are digitally coded, strong error-free signals
Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Systems
29

are needed to properly decrypt transmissions limiting radio reception at the edge of an analog
system’s coverage.
In addition, due to encryption in both analog and digital systems, the call setup time can
increase because of the additional steps in the encryption process such as base-mobile
synchronization, key exchange, and encryption/decryption delay.  Voice quality may also degrade
when encryption is used.
The management of encrypted radios would also affect the security profile of the system.
The manner in which keys and key-loading devices are physically protected is important.  The
type of algorithm used and length of keys affect the strength of the encryption.
LMR network encryption can be configured as air interface-only or end-to-end
encryption.  Obviously, end-to-end encryption configuration is much more secure.
Encryption qualities of an LMR network are not affected by type of network architecture,
conventional, trunked or hybrid.  All four types of encryption products and algorithms are
available on all types of LMR network architectures.
5.8
Network Security
Each physical component of the conventional architecture represents a potential security
vulnerability: base stations/repeaters, consoles, satellite receivers, telephone patches, controllers,
etc.  A conventional network differs essentially from trunked and hybrid LMR architectures in its
reduced network complexity and number of components (for similar capacity configurations).
When similar security features are in place, a conventional network offers greater network
security than other configurations due to the fewer points of potential electronic intrusion.
The RF link of a conventional network represents a second type of security risk.  In a
conventional network, radio channels are stable and not dynamically assigned.  A radio user
manually selects a radio channel and uses that channel for all conversations with a specific user
community.  Thus, transmission generally occurs on the same channel each time.  For example, a
maintenance user group assigned a maintenance channel always transmits on the same frequency.
Without an encryption feature, an unauthorized intercept can tune in to that specific channel to
gain access to each conversation.
Often described by vendors as an anti-eavesdropping security feature, the channel
switching that occurs during trunking does not make eavesdropping more difficult due to the
existence of trunking scanners designed to interpret trunking control signaling.  Nonetheless, just
as advanced conventional networks, advanced trunked networks typically offer a wide suite of
features developed to strengthen defense from major communications security threats.  Such
features typically include the following:
• Equipment Electronic Serial Number and/or User Identity Module cards
• Provisions to prevent replay of messages
Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Systems
30
May 1999
• Over-the-air rekeying (for systems utilizing encryption)
• Over-the-air deactivation of stolen radios
• User radio access denial.
The physical security of a hybrid network is similar to a trunked network.  A hybrid
network has most of all the components of a trunked network.  The greater complexity and
number of network components makes it more susceptible to intrusions than conventional
networks.  However, the use of a central controller also provides a hybrid network with the
ability to increase the difficulty of unauthorized radio access through the use of user IDs.
The RF security of a hybrid network conventional overlay are similar to those of a stand-
alone conventional network architecture.  The security of a trunked overlay of a hybrid network
is essentially similar to that of a stand-alone trunked network. The overall security of a network
will be determined by the security of its least secure overlay.
5.9
Network Robustness
Graceful degradation, when system continues to operate but provides a reduced level of
service rather than failing completely, is the key to determining robustness of a network.
Conventional network configurations use independent base stations/repeaters to handle
broadcasts to large geographic areas.  Although multisite networks use interconnected and
synchronized receivers and comparators to determine which received signal should be
rebroadcast, each site is still capable of functioning independently in the event of a
voter/comparator failure.  Because each independent base station/repeater does not require
interaction with a network controller to operate normally, conventional networks offer a high
level of robustness.  In the event of a failure of a particular network site (base station, diversity
receiver, console, etc.), the remaining components are able to operate independently to provide
service to users within range of operational components.  Although coverage and services may
decrease, the entire network does not suffer a service outage due to a single failure.
Adaptability is another key criterion to determining a network’s robustness.  Network
robustness must take into account network architecture, network configuration, and manufacturer
specifications.
Consider communicating on a particular channel in a conventional network when a
channel fault occurs.  The users on that channel should know in advance what channel to switch
to, if another channel is available.  This situation does not typically occur in trunked radio
networks, since they are computer-controlled.  If a repeater channel falls out, the controller
registers the fault and does not assign the repeater channel as a traffic path until the malfunction
is repaired or disappears.  Since channels are allocated as needed and no user group is dependent
on any one channel for communications, the failure of a single channel most likely is not
noticeable to the users unless the network is under a heavy user load.
In a trunked simulcast network, all links between the simulcast sites (i.e., microwave)
should have a backup.  Should the system clock be lost, the transmission will loose
Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Systems
31

synchronization and the network will fail with each site operating as a stand-alone site and
overlap zones being extremely noisy.
Some trunked networks have been designed so that if the designated control channel is
lost, then one of the other repeater channels assumes control channel responsibility.  If this
feature is not provided in a centralized trunked network, a loss of a control channel will typically
make the whole site function in so called "soft-fail" mode meaning that the site operates in a
conventional mode.  If neither control channel reassignment, nor the soft-fail feature is available,
the loss of a control channel will lead to a loss of the entire site.
The use of a central controller, creates a single point of failure for certain network
functions in centralized trunked and hybrid network architectures.  The controller is responsible
for allocating channels to all user groups.  If a redundant controller or other controller backup
capability is not used, the failure of a controller can eliminate the network’s ability to
dynamically assign channels and can bring the network down.  Depending upon manufacturer
specifications, individual sites may be able to operate in stand-alone mode without a central
controller, providing some communication ability to all or some users within range.
The robustness qualities of the hybrid network conventional overlay are similar to those
of a stand-alone conventional network architecture.  The network robustness of a trunked overlay
of a hybrid network is essentially similar to that of a stand-alone trunked network. The overall
robustness of a network is determined by the robustness of its least robust overlay.

5.10 Multiorganizational Interoperability
Conventional networks provide service to different user groups by frequency separation.
Each user group can be provided its own half-duplex or full-duplex channel.  In this way, both
privacy and network sharing can be gained.  Although each channel requires its own
repeater/base station, other multichannel components such as consoles and radios can be shared
by scanning or manually switching among all authorized channels. Authorized users may be able
to access other groups on the same or nearby networks by programming their radio to access
other channels/frequencies.  Limitations to this ability arise if different channels use incompatible
components made by different vendors or if networks operate in incompatible modes (25 kHz
versus narrowband, FDMA versus TDMA, or analog versus digital, unless radios conform to
interoperability standards such as TIA/EIA-102).  In addition, if the components for each channel
are fully compatible, similar features can be provided to all users of all groups.  If air interface
interoperability is not feasible, audio cross-patching between dispatch panels is widely used.
Trunked networks are not more or less interoperable than conventional networks of the
same level of technology. As in case of conventional networks, users from trunked networks
cannot access other networks if their radios do not operate on the other network’s frequencies or
use different technologies (e.g., digital versus analog, narrowband versus 25 kHz wideband).
Networks with different trunking protocols cannot interoperate.  Nonetheless, trunked networks
have some advantages for management of interoperability features. For example, creation of new
talk groups or adding new members to an existing talk group can be done in real time, allowing
formation of talk groups across organizational lines on as-needed basis.  As in conventional
networks, if air interface interoperability between networks is not feasible, audio cross-patching
between dispatch panels can be used.
Hybrid networks provide the same level of interoperability among organizations as
trunked networks.
5.11 Ability To Handle Multiple Voice and Data Applications
Current conventional networks do not allow the ability to simultaneously transmit both
voice and data signals on the same channel.  At any one moment, a radio user may transmit only
voice or data.
The technical features with the greatest effect on data transmission characteristics of a
network the most are the channel’s signal-to-noise ratio, available bandwidth, and modulation
technique.  The most important parameter for data transmission is the channel’s signal-to-noise
ratio.  As a general rule, this ratio is low for LMR compared with other data transmission
mediums and decreases with distance from the base station.  Consequently, although some
advanced applications can support rates as high as 19,200 bits per second (bps), data rates for
LMR are typically low, averaging at around 2400 bps or less.  In the case of analog conventional
networks, data transmission capability is limited by the noisy medium and available bandwidth to
very low speed (typically 2400 bps).
Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Systems
33
May 1999
Sharing of a conventional channel for both voice and data is not typically performed
because of the incompatibility of voice and data usage and bandwidth requirements.  However,
the use of dedicated conventional channels and packet-switched data format for wireless data
transmissions, regardless whether the technology is analog or digital, is a common industry
practice.
The technical features that affect data transmission characteristics of a network the most,
such as the channel’s signal-to-noise ratio, available bandwidth, and modulation technique, are
not dependent on the choice of conventional or trunked architecture.  Nonetheless, in certain
network configurations, if transmission trunking is used as opposed to conversation trunking, the
call setup delay time for re-establishing a trunked call between data bursts may negatively affect
the data transfer rate.  Therefore, in many cases, the use of circuit-switched data applications may
be more efficient for trunked networks, since it requires only one call setup in the beginning of
the call, but it can vary depending on a specific network configuration and data-handling
protocols.  Packet data applications such as CDPD can be implemented on trunked systems using
dedicated data channels or idle channels as in AMPS application.
Among the three architecture types, the hybrid architecture is better suited for designing
multiple voice and data applications because it gives the flexibility of placing data either on
dedicated conventional channels (mostly for packet-switched applications) or on trunked
infrastructure (mainly for circuit-switched data).  Such a configuration allows for both groups of
network requirements, the voice and the data, to be met more efficiently.
5.12 Technology Evolution
Technology is moving, in general, toward digital networks.  Two of the most important
public safety user communications requirements, better quality of audio and encryption, are
advanced by the use of digital technology.  Compared with their analog counterparts, digital
networks give the advantage of more consistent toll-quality voice communications over a wider
coverage area.  They also accommodate encryption more easily, allowing encrypted
communications be conducted over multiple cross-patches without degradation of voice quality.
In addition, driven by increasingly scarce spectrum and higher spectrum efficiency requirements
placed on vendors, networks with five or more channels will tend to be trunked in the future.
Large conventional networks will not be as supported or available in the future as they are
currently, because of the greater spectrum efficiency achieved through trunking.  However, small
conventional networks will still be available for smaller user organizations and networks.
Trunked LMR networks’ evolution is driven by the same market demands, which include
better audio quality, higher spectral efficiency, increased user and traffic capacity, enhanced data
transmission capability, communications privacy, and ease of use and management.  In an
attempt to satisfy these demands, manufacturers are producing networks with digital voice,
advanced digital modulation techniques, encryption, and over-the-air reprogramming.
Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Systems
34
May 1999
The LMR technology is migrating towards more spectrum-efficient networks to serve
more users with less spectrum. In the TIA/EIA-102 Phase I, spectral efficiency of 12.5 kHz per
channel was achieved.  The second phase of the TIA/EIA-102 suite of standards has two tracks:
FDMA (frequency division multiple access) and TDMA (time division multiple access).  To
achieve a spectral efficiency equivalent to 6.25 kHz per channel, it is possible that Phase II of the
TIA/EIA-102 may be a TDMA network.
Advances in cellular technology may make it a major competitor to traditional LMR
networks.  For example, one manufacturer is planning to introduce an LMR look-alike system
that runs on existing GSM networks.  The system is intended to allow GSM operators to sell
LMR services as if on a private network.  The new system needs no network-level alterations,
except for a new dedicated server.  At the client end, necessary additions may include new
terminals incorporating LMR functions, as well as a dispatch console running on a PC to provide
central control for companies subscribing to the service.  Two major drawbacks of such systems
would be an inherent, significant call delay resulting from consecutive dial-up of talk group
members and unavailability of the repeater talk-around mode when mobiles communicate with
each other directly (without a repeater).
5.13 Policy Impact
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates state and local public safety
agency communications, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA) has jurisdiction over federal agency communications.  Both have emphasized public
safety spectrum allocation and efficient use and have historically supported the use of both
conventional and trunked LMR technologies.  Recent policy actions, however, indicate that as
technology progresses and available spectrum becomes increasingly scarce, the FCC is
encouraging public safety users to migrate to LMR networks using trunked technology [4].  Also,
the FCC National Public Safety Plan Report and Order provides incentives for using trunking
and requires small entities with minimal requirements to join together in using a single system
where possible4, thus endorsing trunking as a spectrum-efficient technology.  FCC and NTIA
regulations that impact network architecture considerations are explained below.
5.13.1 Development of a Public Safety National Plan
Until 1987, the FCC did not require public safety agencies to use one type of technology
over another.  In 1987, the FCC formulated a National Public Safety Plan Report and Order,
allocating 821-824 MHz and 866-869 MHz for public safety use.  Five channels in this band
were designated for use only in mutual aid situations to facilitate interoperability, so-called
"NPSPAC channels."  These channels were designated solely for conventional LMR technology,
which was chosen as the lowest common denominator.
Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Systems
35

The national plan also specified that any public safety agency applying for four or fewer
channels for their private network in the 821-824/866-869 MHz bands might choose to build
conventional or trunked networks; however, agencies applying for more than four channels in
that band were required to build trunked LMR networks without specifying a particular trunking
standard or technology.  Small agencies with minimal requirements were required to join
together in using a single system where possible5.
5.13.2 Spectrum Refarming
In October 1997, the FCC implemented new rules (PR Docket No. 92-235), termed the
refarming rules, to improve spectrum efficiency standards for non-federal public safety LMR
networks operating at frequencies below 800 MHz.  The new rules consolidated seven categories
of public safety services into one public safety pool and, as shown in Exhibit 12, created
narrower channels.  Manufacturers are to phase in new narrowband equipment that meets the
new channeling guidelines, and use of dual mode (conventional/trunked) equipment is now
permitted.  Neither existing public safety licensees nor new applicants were required to replace
their existing systems or to use any particular type of technology or operate in any particular
frequency band. The rules ensure that narrowband equipment will be available by requiring that
radio equipment type accepted by the FCC over a ten-year period meets increasingly efficient
spectral requirements.  Under this plan, non-federal public safety radio users have the freedom to
choose equipment that best fulfills their needs while balancing technical capabilities and
financial considerations. [5]

Exhibit 12
Refarmed Frequency Bands
Prior to the implementation of the refarming rules, centralized trunking was not generally
permitted on public safety LMR networks operating at frequencies below 800 MHz.  The FCC
Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Systems
36
May 1999
believed that centralized trunking did not offer adequate interference protection.  The refarming
order amended the rules to permit public safety entities to build centralized trunked LMR
networks below 800 MHz, provided that:
• The licensee had an exclusive license area (applicable only to users of the 470−512 MHz
band)
• The licensee did not have an exclusive service area, but obtained consent from all licensees
who had co-channel or adjacent channel operations.
As for federal users, the NTIA requires that after January 1, 1995, all new systems, and
after January 1, 2005, all systems in the 162-174 MHz band must conform to narrowband
standards.  After January 1, 1995, all new systems and after January 1, 2008, all systems in the
406.1-420 MHz band must conform to narrowband standards.  After January 1, 1997, all new
systems and after January 1, 2008, all systems in the 138-150.8 MHz band must conform to
narrowband standards. [12]
5.13.3 Allocation of Additional Public Safety Spectrum
In the Reallocation Report and Order6, the FCC has allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the
764−776/794−806 MHz bands to public safety use. The service rules for this spectrum have been
released in First Report and Order and Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking called "The
Development of Operational, Technical, and Spectrum Requirements for Meeting Federal, State,
and Local Public Safety Agency Communication Requirements through the Year 2010.
Establishment of Rules and Requirements for Priority Access Service" (FCC 98-191).  The FCC
separated the spectrum into two categories: general use, which includes everyday operations in
addition to mutual aid and emergency preparedness or task force operations; and interoperability,
which is reserved for situations that require multiple agencies to communicate and amounts to
approximately 10 percent of the new band.  It also required all 700-MHz band equipment
(general use, interoperability, and reserve) use digital modulation as its primary modulation
mode.7  The rules do not require a specific digital modulation standard, and public safety
licensees are allowed to independently select the equipment and technologies that best meet their
particular communications needs on general use or reserve channels.  Of greatest impact to
conventional and trunked network architectures is the FCC’s decision to establish the Public
Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC) to work on interoperability issues in the 700-
MHz band and specifically evaluating the possible use of trunking technology on interoperability
channels and the adoption of a trunking standard.  The FCC "will strongly recommend to the
NCC that it immediately consider the benefits of employing trunking on (at least) a portion of the
nationwide interoperability spectrum,8 and we (the FCC) will direct it to make a timely
recommendation to us as to whether Commission action to require trunking on nationwide
Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Systems

interoperability spectrum is needed.9"  In the event that a trunking standard for nationwide
interoperability use is required, the FCC would prefer, instead of choosing one trunking
technology on the market over another, to have a compatible trunking standard be developed by
an American National Standards Institute-accredited standard setting body.
5.13.4 Federal Entities Seeking Authorization To Build Trunked Networks
Federal users seeking to build or expand LMR networks must define their needs,
determine what type of system will meet their needs, and provide the required information to
their agency to forward to the NTIA for review.  Under the Interdepartment Radio Advisory
Committee (IRAC) , the Spectrum Planning Subcommittee (SPS) reviews new and previously
approved LMR trunking technologies.  One of their responsibilities is to certify that the operation
of the technology in the proposed environment will not cause harmful interference to other
