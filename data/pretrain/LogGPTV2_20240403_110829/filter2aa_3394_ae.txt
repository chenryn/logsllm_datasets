### 5.7 Network Encryption

Network encryption is essential for users requiring enhanced security against advanced interceptors. With current technological advancements, digital encryption has become the standard. Digital voice encryption involves sampling, digitizing, encrypting, transmitting, and decrypting the analog voice signal in real-time.

Standard network encryption schemes are available on all types of Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems, independent of system type and architecture. In the United States, four types of encryption products and algorithms are deployed:

1. **Type 1** - Classified or controlled cryptographic items endorsed by the National Security Agency (NSA) for securing classified and sensitive U.S. Government information. Type 1 products contain classified NSA algorithms and are available to U.S. Government users, their contractors, and federally sponsored non-U.S. Government activities, subject to export restrictions under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR).

2. **Type 2** - Unclassified cryptographic equipment, assemblies, or components endorsed by the NSA for use in telecommunications and automated information systems to protect national security information. Type 2 products may not be used for classified information but contain classified NSA algorithms. They are also subject to ITAR export restrictions.

3. **Type 3** - Cryptographic algorithms registered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and published as Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for protecting unclassified sensitive or commercial information.

4. **Type 4** - Unclassified cryptographic algorithms registered by NIST but not designated as FIPS.

#### Potential Drawbacks of Encryption in Analog LMR Systems

In analog LMR systems, using portable or mobile devices in encrypted mode can reduce radio coverage compared to unencrypted operation due to quantization noise. Users estimate that the range of an encrypted analog transmitter can decrease by up to 30%. Additionally, the need for strong, error-free signals to properly decrypt transmissions can limit reception at the edge of an analog system’s coverage.

Encryption in both analog and digital systems can increase call setup time due to additional steps such as base-mobile synchronization, key exchange, and encryption/decryption delays. Voice quality may also degrade when encryption is used.

The management of encrypted radios, including the physical protection of keys and key-loading devices, is crucial for maintaining the system's security profile. The type of algorithm and key length significantly affect the strength of the encryption.

LMR network encryption can be configured as either air interface-only or end-to-end encryption. End-to-end encryption is more secure. The encryption qualities of an LMR network are not affected by the type of network architecture (conventional, trunked, or hybrid), and all four types of encryption products and algorithms are available on all types of LMR network architectures.

### 5.8 Network Security

Each physical component of a conventional LMR architecture, such as base stations, repeaters, consoles, satellite receivers, telephone patches, and controllers, represents a potential security vulnerability. Conventional networks, with their reduced complexity and fewer components, offer greater network security than trunked or hybrid architectures due to fewer points of potential electronic intrusion.

The RF link in a conventional network presents a second type of security risk. Channels are stable and not dynamically assigned, allowing unauthorized intercepts to tune into specific channels and access conversations. While trunked networks use channel switching, which is often marketed as an anti-eavesdropping feature, trunking scanners can still interpret the control signaling. Advanced trunked networks, like conventional ones, typically offer features to enhance security, such as:

- Equipment Electronic Serial Number and/or User Identity Module cards
- Provisions to prevent replay of messages
- Over-the-air rekeying (for systems utilizing encryption)
- Over-the-air deactivation of stolen radios
- User radio access denial

Hybrid networks, which combine elements of both conventional and trunked systems, have similar physical security to trunked networks. The central controller in a hybrid network can increase the difficulty of unauthorized access through the use of user IDs. However, the overall security of a hybrid network is determined by its least secure overlay.

### 5.9 Network Robustness

Robustness is a key criterion for determining the reliability of a network. Conventional networks, with their independent base stations and repeaters, offer high robustness. Each site can function independently, even if a voter/comparator fails. This independence ensures that the entire network does not suffer a service outage due to a single failure, although coverage and services may decrease.

Adaptability is another critical factor in network robustness. In conventional networks, users should know in advance which channel to switch to if a channel fault occurs. In trunked networks, the controller manages channel allocation, so the failure of a single channel is less noticeable unless the network is heavily loaded.

Trunked simulcast networks require backup links between sites to maintain synchronization. If the system clock is lost, the network will fail, with each site operating independently and overlap zones becoming noisy. Some trunked networks can reassign a control channel if the designated one fails, but without this feature, the network may enter a "soft-fail" mode, operating in a conventional manner.

Hybrid networks, with their central controller, create a single point of failure for certain functions. Redundant controllers or other backup capabilities are necessary to prevent a complete network failure. The robustness of a hybrid network is determined by the robustness of its least robust overlay.

### 5.10 Multiorganizational Interoperability

Conventional networks provide service to different user groups through frequency separation, allowing each group to have its own half-duplex or full-duplex channel. This setup ensures privacy and network sharing. Multichannel components like consoles and radios can be shared by scanning or manually switching among authorized channels. However, interoperability is limited if different channels use incompatible components or operate in different modes (e.g., 25 kHz vs. narrowband, FDMA vs. TDMA, analog vs. digital). Audio cross-patching between dispatch panels is a common solution for interoperability issues.

Trunked networks are not inherently more or less interoperable than conventional networks. Trunked networks offer advantages in managing interoperability features, such as real-time creation and modification of talk groups. Hybrid networks provide the same level of interoperability as trunked networks.

### 5.11 Ability to Handle Multiple Voice and Data Applications

Current conventional networks do not support simultaneous transmission of voice and data on the same channel. The key parameters affecting data transmission include the channel’s signal-to-noise ratio, available bandwidth, and modulation technique. LMR networks typically have low data rates, averaging around 2400 bps or less.

Sharing a conventional channel for both voice and data is not practical due to incompatibility and bandwidth requirements. However, dedicated conventional channels and packet-switched data formats are commonly used for wireless data transmissions.

In trunked networks, the call setup delay for re-establishing a trunked call between data bursts can negatively affect data transfer rates. Circuit-switched data applications are often more efficient in trunked networks, requiring only one call setup at the beginning of the call. Packet data applications, such as CDPD, can be implemented on trunked systems using dedicated data channels or idle channels.

Hybrid architectures offer flexibility in placing data on dedicated conventional channels (for packet-switched applications) or on trunked infrastructure (for circuit-switched data), allowing for more efficient handling of both voice and data requirements.

### 5.12 Technology Evolution

The trend in LMR technology is moving towards digital networks, driven by the need for better audio quality and encryption. Digital networks provide consistent toll-quality voice communications over a wider coverage area and accommodate encryption more easily. As spectrum becomes scarcer, networks with five or more channels are likely to be trunked in the future, with large conventional networks becoming less common.

Trunked LMR networks are evolving to meet market demands for better audio quality, higher spectral efficiency, increased user and traffic capacity, enhanced data transmission, and ease of use and management. Manufacturers are producing networks with digital voice, advanced digital modulation techniques, encryption, and over-the-air reprogramming.

The TIA/EIA-102 standards aim to achieve higher spectral efficiency, with Phase II potentially introducing TDMA networks to achieve 6.25 kHz per channel. Advances in cellular technology, such as GSM-based LMR look-alike systems, may also compete with traditional LMR networks, though they come with drawbacks like significant call delay and lack of repeater talk-around mode.

### 5.13 Policy Impact

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) regulate state, local, and federal public safety agency communications, respectively. Both agencies emphasize public safety spectrum allocation and efficient use, historically supporting both conventional and trunked LMR technologies. Recent policy actions, however, encourage the migration to trunked LMR networks to improve spectral efficiency.

#### 5.13.1 Development of a Public Safety National Plan

In 1987, the FCC formulated the National Public Safety Plan Report and Order, allocating the 821-824 MHz and 866-869 MHz bands for public safety use. Five channels were designated for mutual aid situations, known as NPSPAC channels, reserved for conventional LMR technology. Agencies applying for more than four channels in this band were required to build trunked LMR networks, while small agencies with minimal requirements were encouraged to share a single system.

#### 5.13.2 Spectrum Refarming

In October 1997, the FCC implemented new rules (PR Docket No. 92-235) to improve spectrum efficiency for non-federal public safety LMR networks below 800 MHz. These rules consolidated seven categories of public safety services into one pool and created narrower channels. Manufacturers must phase in new narrowband equipment, and dual-mode (conventional/trunked) equipment is now permitted. Existing licensees and new applicants are not required to replace their systems or use specific technologies, but new equipment must meet increasingly efficient spectral requirements over a ten-year period.

#### 5.13.3 Allocation of Additional Public Safety Spectrum

The FCC has allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 764-776/794-806 MHz bands for public safety use. The spectrum is divided into general use and interoperability categories, with the latter reserved for multi-agency communication. All 700-MHz band equipment must use digital modulation, and the FCC established the Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC) to evaluate the use of trunking technology on interoperability channels and the adoption of a trunking standard.

#### 5.13.4 Federal Entities Seeking Authorization to Build Trunked Networks

Federal entities seeking to build or expand LMR networks must define their needs, determine the appropriate system, and provide the required information to their agency for review by the NTIA. The Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) and the Spectrum Planning Subcommittee (SPS) review new and previously approved LMR trunking technologies to ensure they do not cause harmful interference to other operations.
