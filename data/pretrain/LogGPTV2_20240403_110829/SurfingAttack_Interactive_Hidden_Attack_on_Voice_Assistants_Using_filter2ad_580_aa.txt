Abstract—With recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence and
natural language processing, voice has become a primary method
for human-computer interaction. It has enabled game-changing
new technologies in both commercial sectors and military sectors,
such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and voice-controlled naval
warships. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that these
voice assistant systems are susceptible to signal
injection at
the inaudible frequencies. To date, most of the existing works
focus primarily on delivering a single command via line-of-sight
ultrasound speaker or extending the range of this attack via
speaker array. However, besides air, sound waves also propagate
through other materials where vibration is possible. In this
work, we aim to understand the characteristics of this new
genre of attack in the context of different transmission media.
Furthermore, by leveraging the unique properties of acoustic
transmission in solid materials, we design a new attack called
SurﬁngAttack that would enable multiple rounds of interactions
between the voice-controlled device and the attacker over a longer
distance and without the need to be in line-of-sight. By completing
the interaction loop of inaudible sound attack, SurﬁngAttack
enables new attack scenarios, such as hijacking a mobile Short
Message Service (SMS) passcode, making ghost
fraud calls
without owners’ knowledge, etc. To accomplish SurﬁngAttack,
we have solved several major challenges. First, the signal has
been specially designed to allow omni-directional transmission
for performing effective attacks over a solid medium. Second,
the new attack enables multi-round interaction without alerting
the legitimate user at the scene, which is challenging since the
device is designed to interact with users in physical proximity
rather than sensors. To mitigate this newly discovered threat,
we also provide discussions and experimental results on potential
countermeasures to defend against this new threat.

INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning have enabled new game-changing technologies for
humans to interact with machines. Conversation with AI is
no longer a scene in science-ﬁction movies, but day-to-day
routines. It is now possible for everyday users to converse

with voice assistants, such as Bixby, Siri, Google Assistant to
arrange appointments on the calendar or to start the morning
coffee brewing. While these new technologies signiﬁcantly
improve the living quality, they also change the landscape of
cyber threats. Recent studies show that it is possible to exploit
the non-linearity in microphone to deliver inaudible commands
to the system via ultrasound signals [41], [42], [44], [52].
DolphinAttack [52] by Zhang et al. was among the ﬁrst to
demonstrate inaudible attacks towards voice-enabled devices
by injecting ultrasound signals over the air, which can launch
from a distance of 5ft to the device. Recognizing the limitation
in the range of the attack, LipRead [42] extends the attack
range to 25ft by aggregating ultrasound signals from an array
of speakers, which requires line-of-sight. While these two
attacks demonstrate the feasibility of voice command injection
via inaudible ultrasound, they focus solely on over the air
transmission, which leads to several inherent limitations due
to the physical property of ultrasound wave propagation in air,
such as signiﬁcant performance degradation when there is line-
of-sight obstruction. However, sound wave is fundamentally
the transfer of acoustic energy through a medium. It can
propagate wherever vibration is possible, such as water and
solid materials, in which the propagation characteristics are
different from air. Furthermore, the current literature [42],
[44], [52] focuses mostly on one-way interaction, i.e., they
inject commands to voice assistants without expecting any
feedback. However, voice-activated devices are designed to
enable multiple rounds of interactions. While the previous
literature has identiﬁed the new attack vector, its potential in
multi-round communication has received little attention.
In this work, we aim to understand the new threats enabled
by inaudible signal injection using ultrasound propagation in

hidden communication with AI-based voice assistants. Using
our proposed attack, SurﬁngAttack1, we found that it is possible
to deliver various inaudible voice commands in ultrasound to a
wide range of target devices from different manufacturers via
different solid media. Due to the unique properties of guided
wave propagation, SurﬁngAttack not only enables attacks from
a longer distance with a lower power requirement, but also
eliminates the need to be in the line-of-sight for inaudible
command injection attacks. By capitalizing on the capabil-
ity to control feedback mechanisms via the initial injected
command, SurﬁngAttack also enables inaudible multi-rounds
of interactions between the attacker and the target device
without alerting users in physical proximity. Fig. 1 illustrates
one of the application scenarios of SurﬁngAttack, where a
malicious device is hidden beneath the table to converse with
the target device on the top. By injecting voice commands
stealthily, attackers can instruct the voice assistants to leak
various secrets, such as an authentication code for money
transfer sent via an SMS message. The leaked secret can then
be picked up by a malicious device hidden away and relayed
back to the remote attacker. By leveraging unique guided wave
propagation properties in solid media, SurﬁngAttack presents
a new genre of inaudible attack on voice-activated systems.
While conceptually simple, there are several major chal-
lenges in realizing this attack: (a) how to design a hidden signal
generator that can penetrate materials effectively and inject the
inaudible commands without facing the victim’s device? (b)
How to engage in multiple rounds of conversations with the
victim’s device such that the voice response is unnoticeable to
humans while still being recorded by a tapping device?
i.e., piezoelectric (PZT) transducer,
For the ﬁrst question, while the characteristics of sound
wave propagation in solid material is well studied for speciﬁc
application domains such as structure damage detection [39],
adapting the technique to deliver inaudible commands presents
unique challenges, such as wave mode selection, vertical
energy maximization, and velocity dispersion minimization.
Traditional ultrasonic speakers, as used in previous attacks,
are not suitable for exciting guided waves in table materi-
als due to their transducer structures. In order to adapt to
type of ultrasonic
the solid medium, we utilize a special
transducer,
to generate
ultrasonic guided waves by inducing minor vibrations of the
solid materials. However, due to the unique characteristics
of ultrasound transmission in different solid materials,
the
selection of different modes of guided wave can lead to
signiﬁcant differences in the attack outcome, compared to
the over-the-air delivery of manipulated signals. To enable
SurﬁngAttack, we redesign a new modulation scheme that
considers wave dispersal patterns to achieve optimal inaudible
command delivery. SurﬁngAttack presents two unique features.
First, the attack is omni-directional, which works regardless
of the target’s orientation or physical environment where the
target resides. Second, the success of the attack is not impacted
by objects on a busy tabletop. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the ﬁrst to deliver inaudible commands to a variety
of mobile devices through ultrasonic guided waves in a busy
environment. For the second question,
to enable inaudible

and reach the surface to launch attacks, and thus is dubbed SurﬁngAttack.

multi-rounds of interactions, a tapping device is added along
with the ultrasound transducer to capture voice feedbacks from
the device. In order to minimize the impact of the feedback
on the environment, an injected command is used to tune
the output of the device to the lowest volume setting, such
that the feedback becomes difﬁcult to notice by users, but
can still be captured by a sensitive tapping device. We have
conducted a series of experiments to understand the feasibility
and limitation of such low-proﬁle feedback.
Leveraging the low attenuation of guided waves in solid
material and a place to hide the attack device, SurﬁngAttack
can enable a variety of new attacks including not only the
non-interactive attacks such as visiting a malicious website,
spying, injecting fake information, and denial of service by
turning on the airplane mode, but also interactive attacks that
would require multiple rounds of conversations with the target
device, such as unauthorized transfer of assets from the bank.
To demonstrate the practicality of SurﬁngAttack, we build a
prototype of the attack device using a commercial-off-the-shelf
PZT transducer, which costs around $5 per piece. Using our
prototype device, we conduct the following two attacks as a
demonstration:
(1) Hacking an SMS passcode. SMS-based two-factor
authentication has been widely adopted by almost all major
services [17], which often delivers one-time passwords over
SMS. A SurﬁngAttack adversary can activate the victim’s
device to read SMS messages in secret thereby extracting SMS
passcodes.
(2) Making fraudulent calls. A SurﬁngAttack adversary can
also take control of the owner’s phone to call arbitrary numbers
and conduct an interactive dialogue for phone fraud using the
synthetic voice of the victim.
We have tested SurﬁngAttack on 17 popular smartphones
and 4 representative types of tables. We successfully launch
SurﬁngAttack on 15 smartphones and 3 types of tables. A web-
site is set up (https://surﬁngattack.github.io/) to demonstrate
the attacks towards different phones under different scenarios,
and various new attacks such as selﬁe taking, SMS passcode
hacking, and fraudulent phone call attacks. With the growing
popularity of mobile voice commerce and voice payments [25],
we believe the demonstrated interactive hidden attack opens up
new attacker capabilities that the community should be aware
of. In summary, our contributions are as follows,
• We present, SurﬁngAttack,
the ﬁrst exploration of
attack leveraging unique characteristics of ultrasound
propagation in solid medium and non-linearity of
the microphone circuits to inject inaudible command
on voice assistants. We validate the effectiveness
of SurﬁngAttack on Google Assistant of 11 popular
smartphones, and Siri of 4 iPhones. We also show the
attack is resilient against verbal conversations.
• We evaluate SurﬁngAttack on 4 representative types
of table materials. We ﬁnd that SurﬁngAttack is most
effective through 3 types of tables: aluminum/steel,
glass, and medium-density ﬁberboard (MDF). No-
tably, SurﬁngAttack can achieve long-range attack of
30ft distance through a metal table (the longest table
we can acquire is 30ft). We also validate the effective-
ness of SurﬁngAttack on aluminum and glass tables
with different thicknesses (up to 1.5 inch aluminum
and 3/8 inch glass).
• We further explore the possibility to pair command
injection with a hidden microphone to enable hidden
conversations between the attacker and the victim
voice assistant. We demonstrate several practical at-
tacks using the prototype we build, including hacking
an SMS passcode and making a ghost fraud phone call
without owners’ knowledge.
• We provide discussions on several potential defense
mechanisms, including using the high-frequency com-
ponents of guided waves as an indication of intrusion.
II. BACKGROUND AND THREAT MODEL
In this section, we introduce the background knowledge of
inaudible voice attack and physics of ultrasonic guided waves.
A. Inaudible Voice Attack
Audio capturing hardware in voice-controllable systems
generally includes a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)
sensor to convert mechanical vibration to a digital signal, one
or more ampliﬁers, a low-pass ﬁlter (LPF), and an analog-to-
digital converter (ADC) to retrieve the sound in the physical
world. Inaudible voice attacks leverage the non-linearity of
the microphone circuits to inject inaudible commands to these
systems. The nonlinear response is due to the imperfection
of microphone and ampliﬁer circuits [16], [27]. Let the input
sound signal be s(t), the output of microphone can be written
as:
sout(t) = A1s(t) + A2s2(t),
(1)
where Ai (i = 1, 2) is the gain of si(t), while the higher
order terms are ignored as they are typically extremely weak.
The non-linearity term s2(t) produces harmonics and cross-
products. With carefully-crafted input signals based on the
baseband signals of voice commands, the microphone with
non-linearity can recover the baseband signals using the cross-
product term at the low frequency. Let the baseband voice
signal be v(t), the modulated input signal for launching attack
is designed as:
s(t) = (1 + v(t))cos(2πfct),
(2)
where fc is ultrasonic carrier frequency. After passing through
the microphone, the recorded signal by the microphone be-
comes:
r(t) = A2(1 + 2v(t) + v2(t))/2,
(3)
since the high frequency components will be ﬁltered out
by LPF. If the voice command component v(t) dominates
in the recorded signal, the voice controllable systems will
recognize the command. Previous work [52] demonstrated that
the nonlinear effect of MEMS microphone can be best incited
by ultrasonic frequencies between 20 kHz and 40 kHz.
B. Ultrasonic Guided Waves
The ultrasonic guided waves propagating in free solid-
material plates are known as Lamb waves, which have distinct
characteristics compared with ultrasonic waves in air. Assum-
ing the wave motion takes place in the x1x3 plane, propagating
Fig. 2: Symmetric and anti-symmetric Lamb wave modes
schematic in a free table plate. Symmetric Lamb wave is a
family of waves whose motion (the arrows in the ﬁgure) is
symmetrical with respect to the midplane of the plate (the
plane x3 = 0), and anti-symmetric wave is a family of waves
whose motion is anti-symmetric with respect to the midplane.
along the x1 direction, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Assume the
table plate is a stress-free plate with thickness of 2h (along
the x3 direction), i.e., the mechanical component of stress at
the surfaces of the plate is zero. While Lamb waves, made
up of a superposition of longitudinal and transverse modes,
transmit in a thin plate, their propagation characteristics vary
with excitation and structural geometry of the plate. Every
Lamb waveform belongs to one of two modes: symmetric and
anti-symmetric [23], as presented in Fig. 2.
For a symmetric mode waveform at a given frequency,
the displacement ﬁelds u1 (along x1) and u3 (along x3) of
the Lamb wave in the complex-value representation are given
by [23]:
u1(x1, x3, t) = (ikA cos αx3 + βB cos βx3)ei(kx1−ωt)
u3(x1, x3, t) = (−αA sin αx3 − ikB sin βx3)ei(kx1−ωt),
