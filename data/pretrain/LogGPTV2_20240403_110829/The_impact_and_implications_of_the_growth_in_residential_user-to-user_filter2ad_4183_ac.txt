### Residential Broadband (RBB) Customer Traffic

The top graph, labeled (A1), represents the traffic of RBB customers, which include DSL, FTTH, and CATV residential users. During evening hours, the total broadband traffic from these customers exceeds 260 Gbps. The inbound and outbound traffic volumes are nearly equal, with approximately 120 Gbps flowing in both directions. This symmetry is likely due to peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, which generate traffic independently of daily user activities.

The diurnal traffic pattern shows that home user traffic is predominant, with peak hours occurring between 21:00 and 23:00. Weekends exhibit higher daytime traffic compared to weekdays, although the peak rates remain similar. Interestingly, the outbound traffic to customers is slightly higher than the inbound traffic, contrary to the common assumption that downstream traffic is significantly larger. We hypothesize that P2P applications contribute significantly to the upstream traffic, as discussed in Section 4.

Figure 7 compares the inbound traffic of RBB customers in November 2004 and November 2005, showing an overall increase primarily due to the growth of the constantly flowing traffic.

### Non-Residential Broadband (Non-RBB) Customer Traffic

The bottom graph in Figure 6 (A2) illustrates the weekly traffic of non-RBB customers, including leased lines used by secondary or tertiary ISPs. Despite this, the traffic pattern still reflects a strong influence from residential traffic, as evidenced by the peak hours and the differences between weekdays and weekends. However, we also observe office-hour traffic (from 8:00 to 18:00) on weekdays, though it is less significant than residential traffic. The traffic patterns in both graphs differ from typical academic or business usage, where peaks occur during office hours [4, 5, 25].

### External Traffic

To understand the total traffic volume in backbone networks, we analyze external traffic groups. The top graph in Figure 8 (B1) shows traffic to and from six major Internet Exchanges (IXes). The traffic behavior is heavily influenced by residential traffic.

The middle graph in Figure 8 (B2) depicts external domestic traffic, including regional IXes, private peering, and transit, but excluding the six major IXes. The traffic pattern closely mirrors that of the top graph.

The bottom graph in Figure 8 (B3) displays international traffic. Inbound traffic is significantly higher than outbound, and the traffic pattern differs from domestic traffic. Peak hours are still in the evening, but the outbound traffic volume is relatively flat compared to the inbound, indicating that Japanese users downloading content from overseas remains a substantial part of international traffic. Additionally, about 70% of the average inbound rate is constant, possibly due to machine-generated traffic, such as P2P file-sharing.

### Prefectural Traffic

To investigate regional differences, we collected traffic data from 47 prefectures. Figure 9 shows the aggregated traffic of one metropolitan prefecture (top) and one rural prefecture (bottom). Both graphs exhibit similar temporal patterns, with peak positions and weekday/weekend behavior. Approximately 70% of the average traffic is constant, regardless of the total volume. These characteristics are consistent across other prefectures. A notable difference is that metropolitan prefectures experience higher volumes of office-hour traffic, likely due to greater business usage.

Figure 10 plots traffic volumes and populations for the 47 prefectures, revealing that a prefecture's traffic is roughly proportional to its population. This suggests there is no significant regional concentration of heavy internet users. The uniform distribution of aggregated traffic volume is attributed to the widespread availability of high-speed fiber access (100 Mbps) in most areas of Japan.

### Per-Customer Traffic Analysis

This section analyzes Sampled NetFlow data from one ISP. By comparing the aggregated traffic graphs with the ISP’s corresponding data, we find that the traffic characteristics are consistent. Therefore, although the data is from a single ISP, it likely represents Japanese residential traffic.

Table 5 shows the number of unique active users identified by customer IDs in the February dataset. Users are classified into two groups based on average daily inbound traffic: those with more than 2.5 GB/day and those with less than 2.5 GB/day. The total number of active DSL users is slightly higher than fiber users, but there are more heavy-hitters among fiber users.

**Table 5: Ratio of Fiber and DSL Active Users in the February 2005 Dataset**

| Ratio (%) | ≥ 2.5 GB/day (%) | < 2.5 GB/day (%) |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| 95.54     | 42.79            | 52.75            |
| 100       | 46.45            | 53.55            |
| 4.46      | 3.66             | 0.80             |

### Distribution of Heavy-Hitters

Figure 11 shows the cumulative distribution of the total traffic volume of heavy-hitters, ordered by volume. The distribution is computed separately for inbound and outbound traffic. The graph reveals a skewed traffic distribution, where the top N% of heavy-hitters use X% of the total traffic. For example, the top 4% of users account for 75% of the total inbound traffic and 60% of the outbound traffic. This indicates that a small group of heavy-hitters significantly contributes to the total traffic.

Figure 12 compares the (complementary) cumulative distribution of daily traffic per user on a log-log scale, showing the total users (top), fiber users (middle), and DSL users (bottom). The daily traffic volume is the average for the week, and the distribution is computed separately for inbound and outbound traffic. The distributions are heavy-tailed, with a knee in the slope at 2.5 GB/day and the top 4% heavy-hitters.

The lines are drawn at 2.5 GB/day and the top 4% heavy-hitters, marking the knee of the total users' slope.
