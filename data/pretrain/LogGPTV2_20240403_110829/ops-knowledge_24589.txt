I have been encountering errors from the CRON service, even though I do not have a single `cron.yaml` file defined. The cron task is set to run every 4 hours, and I am unsure where to look to correct this issue. Could you please provide guidance on what information is needed to resolve the error?

### Cron Job Errors
**First Cron Error:**
- **Cron Job:** `/admin/push/feedbackservice/process` - Query APNS Feedback service and remove inactive devices
- **Schedule/Last Run/Last Status (All times are UTC):** Every 4 hours (UTC) - Last run: 2014/06/10 07:00:23 - Status: Failed

**Second Cron Error:**
- **Cron Job:** `/admin/push/notifications/cleanup` - Remove no longer needed records of processed notifications
- **Schedule/Last Run/Last Status (All times are UTC):** Every day at 04:45 (America/New_York) - Last run: 2014/06/09 04:45:01 - Status: Failed

This request caused a new process to be started for your application, and thus caused your application code to be loaded for the first time. This request may thus take longer and use more CPU than a typical request for your application.
```

### Resolution Steps
Based on the tip provided by @Greg, the following sequence of events led to the resolution:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - A previous version of the application included a `cron.yaml` file that ran every hour.
   
2. **Attempted Fix:**
   - In a subsequent version, I removed the `cron.yaml` file, assuming that would stop the cron jobs. However, the cron jobs continued to run.
   - Uploading an empty `cron.yaml` file did not resolve the issue.

3. **Successful Fix:**
   - Uploading a `cron.yaml` file with only the line `cron:` (no actual cron jobs defined) stopped the cron jobs from running.

From this, it appears that the behavior of the system is as follows:
- When a `cron.yaml` file is found, it is parsed. If the syntax is correct, its cron jobs are loaded into the app server.
- Simply removing the `cron.yaml` file or uploading an empty, unparseable file does not remove the cron jobs.
- To remove the cron jobs, a new, parseable `cron.yaml` file (with the `cron:` line but no actual jobs) must be uploaded.
- After doing this, the `cron.yaml` file can be removed from future versions, and the old cron jobs will not reappear.

This approach successfully resolved the issue, and the old cron jobs no longer run.
