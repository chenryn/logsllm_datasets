backscatter scenario. We then evaluate µcode for both ambient
backscatter and RFID tag-to-tag communication in both line-of-
sight and through-the-wall scenarios. Finally, we evaluate µcode’s
ability to enable multiple concurrent transmissions.
8.1 Evaluating µmo
We evaluate µmo in an ambient backscatter scenario where two
battery-free devices communicate by backscattering ambient TV
transmissions. The state-of-the-art ambient backscatter system [24]
achieves communication rates of up to 10 kbps at distances of less
than two feet. As described in §4, our design can overcome the de-
sign limitation of [24] and achieve signiﬁcantly higher ranges. To
demonstrate this, we ﬁrst evaluate the bit error rate (BER) as a func-
tion of distance for various transmitter data rates. We then evaluate
the effects of antenna separation on the observed BER values.
8.1.1 BER versus Distance
We evaluate the bit error rate (BER) as a function of the distance
between the two ambient backscatter devices.
Experiments. We perform the experiments using TV transmissions
in the 539 MHz range. We use a single-antenna transmitter and our
two-antenna receiver placed at different distances from each other.
The two antennas at the receiver are separated by half a wavelength.
We compute the bit error rate (BER) observed at the receiver as a
function of the distance between the transmitter and the receiver.
For each distance value, we repeat the experiments at ten differ-
ent adjacent positions to account for multipath effects. We compute
the average BER at each distance by averaging the BER across
the ten locations. Since we are interested in demonstrating high
rates, we use only our 1 MHz analog bandwidth prototype. We re-
peat the experiments for each of four different transmission rates:
1Mbps, 100 kbps, and 10 kbps. To quantify the effect of the TV
signal strength on the BER, we measure the TV power level at our
backscattering transmitter using a spectrum analyzer, and collect re-
sults for four different power levels of -30 dBm, -20 dBm, -10 dBm,
and 0 dBm. To compare the results with existing systems, we repli-
cate the design in [24] at a bit rate of 10 kbps and compute the BER
as a function of distance for different transmit power levels.
Results. Figs. 7(a)-(d) give BER as a function of distance between
the backscattering device and receiver for each of four TV power
levels. Each plot shows the results for three µmo bit rates and the
10 kbps ambient backscatter design. The plots show the following:

Antenna separation (fraction of lambda/2)
Figure 9—Effect of separation between the antennas. BER is
given as a function of the antenna separation.
• The bit error rate increases as the distance between the trans-
mitter and the receiver increases. In general, the BER increases
with the bit rate. This is expected because at larger distances
and higher transmission rates, noise starts affecting decodability.
However, the BER values we measure for the µmo system are
signiﬁcantly lower than in prior work on ambient backscatter.
• As the TV power at the transmitter is reduced, the BER values
across all the bit rates increase. This is because, at lower TV sig-
nal strengths, the backscatter signal power signiﬁcantly reduces,
decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. However, the
BER values measured for µmo are less than 10−2 for distances
up to 7 feet; this is true for all tested bit rates provided the TV
power is greater than -20 dBm.
• At an operational BER of 10−2, µmo achieves bit rates of 1 Mbps
at a distance of 4 ft across the considered ambient power range.
Further, when the ambient power level is greater than -20 dBm,
µmo achieves 1 Mbps at distances up to 7 ft. In comparison, a
10 kbps ambient backscatter device (our baseline) can only op-
erate at distances less than two feet across all four power levels.
We note that the BER for prior single-antenna ambient backscat-
ter designs [24] is close to 50% at 1 Mbps data rates. This is be-
cause, as explained in §4.1, prior designs leverage averaging and
hence the backscattering device can transmit information only at
a rate that is lower than that of averaging. Since averaging must
be done over a signiﬁcant time period to smooth out variations in
the TV transmissions, averaging-based designs [24] do not allow
rates much higher than 10 kbps. In contrast, since µmo elimi-
nates the variations in the TV transmissions using division, it can
achieve a 100X improvement in the communication rate.
8.1.2 BER Versus Antenna Separation
Next, we evaluate the effect of receive antenna separation on
µmo’s ability to decode backscattered transmissions. To do this,
we ﬁx the positions of the transmitter and the receiver at a distance
of three feet from each other. We vary the distance between the two
antennas at the receiver from half a wavelength (0.9 feet) to zero
feet. The transmitter uses a bit rate of 1 Mbps and is placed in lo-
cations where the average TV power is around -10 dBm. We then
compute the BER as a function of the antenna separation at the re-
ceiver. Fig. 9 plots the results of our experiments. The plot shows
that as expected the BER increases as the distance between the two
antennas reduces. However, the BER does not see a signiﬁcant in-
crease until the antenna separation is less than 0.2 half-wavelengths
(0.18 feet). This is because while in theory a half-wavelength sep-
aration is optimal, in practice smaller receive antenna separations
also have good spatial diversity due to wireless multi-path.
We also note that, even when the antenna separation is zero,
the BER is still 10−2. This is because, even at this minimal sep-
aration, the two antennas still experience a small phase difference
that is sufﬁcient to eliminate TV signal ﬂuctuation and decode the
backscattered signal.

Figure 10—Communication range versus power in non-line-of-sight scenarios. The receiver is moved away from the transmitter into
different rooms as shown in Fig. 11. The y-axis represents the number of rooms where the BER is less than 10−2.
Figure 11—Non-line-of-sight experiment locations. We locate
the transmitter in the middle of an ofﬁce at point TX and move the
receiver through several adjacent ofﬁces to determine the number of
walls through which the system can continue to communicate. This
is performed for both RFID tag-to-tag communication (continuous
wave) and ambient backscatter (TV signal) scenarios.
8.2 Evaluating µcode
Next, we evaluate the performance of µcode in practice. As de-
scribed in §5, µcode achieves two main goals. First, it enables
long range RFID tag-to-tag communication by backscattering sig-
nals from an RFID reader. Second, it enables ambient backscatter
communication at ranges much greater than those demonstrated by
existing systems. In this section, we evaluate these goals in both
line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios.
8.2.1
In Line-of-Sight Scenarios
Firstly, we evaluate µcode for RFID tag-to-tag communication
and ambient backscatter in line-of-sight scenarios.
Experiments. We run experiments in a large indoor space with di-
mensions 120 ft × 40 ft × 60 ft. We use both the 1 MHz and 1 kHz
analog bandwidth receiver prototypes that implement µcode. We
pick chip rates of 100 chips/s and 1k chips/s on our 1 kHz band-
width prototype and 10 kchips/s and 100 kchips/s on our 1 MHz
bandwidth prototype. At every chip rate we use a chip length of
300 chips to represent an information bit. This combination of chip
rates and chip lengths translates to bit rates of 0.33 bps, 3.33 bps,
33.3 bps, and 333 bps, respectively. We measure the range achieved
by our system at different RF power levels for the RFID reader or
TV signal as measured at our transmitter. To evaluate the beneﬁts
of RFID tag-to-tag communication in enable connectivity for tags
far from the RFID reader, we place the transmitter (receiver) tag
close to (far from) the RFID reader. We vary the power values from
-30 dBm to 0 dBm by changing the position of the transmitter. For
each combination of power level and transmitted bit rate, we mea-
sure the communication range between the transmitter and the re-
ceiver. To do this, we move the receiver away from the transmitter
and note the distance at which the BER ﬁrst goes below 10−2. Note
that the receiver moves away from the RFID reader in all our exper-
iments.3 We repeat the above experiments with TV transmissions
using our TV backscatter prototypes.
Results. Fig. 8 plots communication range as a function of the sig-
nal strength of the reader and TV transmissions as measured at the
transmitter. Fig. 8(a) and (b) plot the results for our 1 MHz and
1 KHz prototypes, respectively. The plots show the following:
