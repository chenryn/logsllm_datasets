### Evaluation of µcode in Various Scenarios

We evaluate the performance of µcode in both ambient backscatter and RFID tag-to-tag communication scenarios, considering both line-of-sight and through-the-wall conditions. Additionally, we assess µcode's capability to support multiple concurrent transmissions.

### 8.1 Evaluating µmo

#### 8.1.1 Ambient Backscatter Scenario

In this scenario, two battery-free devices communicate by backscattering ambient TV transmissions. The state-of-the-art ambient backscatter system [24] achieves a communication rate of up to 10 kbps at distances less than two feet. As described in §4, our design overcomes the limitations of [24] and achieves significantly higher ranges. To demonstrate this, we first evaluate the bit error rate (BER) as a function of distance for various transmitter data rates. We then examine the effects of antenna separation on the observed BER values.

##### 8.1.1.1 BER versus Distance

**Experiments:**
- **Setup:** Experiments were conducted using TV transmissions in the 539 MHz range. A single-antenna transmitter and a two-antenna receiver were used, with the antennas separated by half a wavelength.
- **Procedure:** The BER was computed as a function of the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. For each distance, experiments were repeated at ten different adjacent positions to account for multipath effects. The average BER at each distance was calculated by averaging the BER across these ten locations.
- **Parameters:** 
  - **Analog Bandwidth Prototype:** 1 MHz
  - **Transmission Rates:** 1 Mbps, 100 kbps, and 10 kbps
  - **TV Power Levels:** -30 dBm, -20 dBm, -10 dBm, and 0 dBm
- **Comparison:** The design from [24] was replicated at a bit rate of 10 kbps, and the BER as a function of distance was computed for different transmit power levels.

**Results:**
- **Figures 7(a)-(d):** These figures show the BER as a function of distance for each of the four TV power levels. Each plot includes results for three µmo bit rates and the 10 kbps ambient backscatter design.
- **Key Observations:**
  - **Distance and Bit Rate:** The BER increases with distance and bit rate. This is expected due to the increased noise affecting decodability at larger distances and higher transmission rates. However, the BER values for µmo are significantly lower than those in prior work on ambient backscatter.
  - **TV Power Level:** As the TV power at the transmitter decreases, the BER values increase across all bit rates. At lower TV signal strengths, the backscatter signal power reduces, decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. However, the BER values measured for µmo remain below 10−2 for distances up to 7 feet, provided the TV power is greater than -20 dBm.
  - **Operational BER:** At an operational BER of 10−2, µmo achieves bit rates of 1 Mbps at a distance of 4 ft across the considered ambient power range. When the ambient power level is greater than -20 dBm, µmo achieves 1 Mbps at distances up to 7 ft. In comparison, a 10 kbps ambient backscatter device (our baseline) can only operate at distances less than two feet across all four power levels.
  - **Comparison with Prior Work:** The BER for prior single-antenna ambient backscatter designs [24] is close to 50% at 1 Mbps data rates. This is because prior designs use averaging, which limits the backscattering device to transmit information at a rate lower than that of averaging. Since averaging must be done over a significant time period to smooth out variations in the TV transmissions, averaging-based designs [24] do not allow rates much higher than 10 kbps. In contrast, µmo eliminates the variations in the TV transmissions using division, achieving a 100X improvement in the communication rate.

##### 8.1.1.2 BER Versus Antenna Separation

**Experiments:**
- **Setup:** The positions of the transmitter and the receiver were fixed at a distance of three feet from each other. The distance between the two antennas at the receiver was varied from half a wavelength (0.9 feet) to zero feet.
- **Procedure:** The transmitter used a bit rate of 1 Mbps and was placed in locations where the average TV power was around -10 dBm. The BER was computed as a function of the antenna separation at the receiver.

**Results:**
- **Figure 9:** This figure shows the BER as a function of the antenna separation. The BER increases as the distance between the two antennas reduces, but does not see a significant increase until the antenna separation is less than 0.2 half-wavelengths (0.18 feet). This is because, while a half-wavelength separation is optimal in theory, smaller receive antenna separations also have good spatial diversity due to wireless multi-path.
- **Minimal Separation:** Even when the antenna separation is zero, the BER remains at 10−2. This is because, even at this minimal separation, the two antennas still experience a small phase difference sufficient to eliminate TV signal fluctuation and decode the backscattered signal.

### 8.2 Evaluating µcode

Next, we evaluate the performance of µcode in practice. As described in §5, µcode achieves two main goals:
1. Enabling long-range RFID tag-to-tag communication by backscattering signals from an RFID reader.
2. Enabling ambient backscatter communication at ranges much greater than those demonstrated by existing systems.

#### 8.2.1 Line-of-Sight Scenarios

**Experiments:**
- **Setup:** Experiments were conducted in a large indoor space with dimensions 120 ft × 40 ft × 60 ft. Both the 1 MHz and 1 kHz analog bandwidth receiver prototypes that implement µcode were used.
- **Chip Rates:**
  - **1 kHz Bandwidth Prototype:** 100 chips/s and 1k chips/s
  - **1 MHz Bandwidth Prototype:** 10 kchips/s and 100 kchips/s
- **Bit Rates:** The combination of chip rates and chip lengths translates to bit rates of 0.33 bps, 3.33 bps, 33.3 bps, and 333 bps, respectively.
- **Procedure:** The range achieved by the system was measured at different RF power levels for the RFID reader or TV signal as measured at the transmitter. The transmitter (receiver) tag was placed close to (far from) the RFID reader to evaluate the benefits of RFID tag-to-tag communication. Power values were varied from -30 dBm to 0 dBm by changing the position of the transmitter. For each combination of power level and transmitted bit rate, the communication range between the transmitter and the receiver was measured by moving the receiver away from the transmitter and noting the distance at which the BER first goes below 10−2.

**Results:**
- **Figure 8:** This figure plots the communication range as a function of the signal strength of the reader and TV transmissions as measured at the transmitter. Figures 8(a) and 8(b) show the results for the 1 MHz and 1 KHz prototypes, respectively. The plots demonstrate the following:
  - **Range and Signal Strength:** The communication range increases with the signal strength of the reader and TV transmissions.
  - **Bit Rates and Range:** Higher bit rates generally result in shorter communication ranges, but µcode still achieves significant improvements over existing systems.

### 8.2.2 Non-Line-of-Sight Scenarios

**Experiments:**
- **Setup:** The receiver was moved away from the transmitter into different rooms to determine the number of walls through which the system can continue to communicate. This was performed for both RFID tag-to-tag communication (continuous wave) and ambient backscatter (TV signal) scenarios.
- **Procedure:** The transmitter was located in the middle of an office at point TX, and the receiver was moved through several adjacent offices. The number of rooms where the BER is less than 10−2 was recorded.

**Results:**
- **Figure 10:** This figure shows the communication range as a function of power in non-line-of-sight scenarios. The y-axis represents the number of rooms where the BER is less than 10−2.
- **Figure 11:** This figure illustrates the non-line-of-sight experiment locations, showing the transmitter in the middle of an office and the receiver moving through several adjacent offices.

By evaluating µcode in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios, we demonstrate its superior performance in enabling long-range communication and supporting multiple concurrent transmissions.
