Recap
• Mostly script kiddies
– OK, only 1 peeping.  Thanks him/her. 
• No serious IoT hackers
– Scripts for popular IPCam, yes.
– Targeted on low hanging fruits.
• Very hard to meet those who want to play
74
Backed by Real Devices?
• Pros
– Shodan thinks it’s not a honeypot
– Correct response, correct action
– Hackers know how to identify a CONPOT
• Cons
– Scalability
• Future works
– Route many IP to one lab
– Rewrite at layer 7 to change serial number, footprints
