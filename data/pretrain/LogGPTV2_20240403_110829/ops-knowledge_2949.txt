User: I originally coded in python IDE on windows. Now when I pasted my code in a file on Linux server. Now when I run the script, it gives me this error:

bad interpreter: No such file or directory

Please tell how to resolve this error.
Assistant: You're probably using the #!python hashbang convention that's inexplicably popular among Windows users. Linux expects a full path there. Use either #!/usr/bin/python or (preferably) #!/usr/bin/env python instead.
