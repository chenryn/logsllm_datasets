In `requests/requests-kerberos` we use GSSAPI to not only authenticate to the
server, but also authenticate the server as well. It's called mutual
authentication. The way that `Session.send` resolves redirects doesn't allow
us to authenticate the redirects.
This is a problem because if a user sends a request to `host_a` which
redirects us to `host_b` and we authenticate `host_b` successfully, that
really doesn't mean anything to the user if he can't actually trust that the
process which issued the redirect was actually `host_a`.
This means that if we want to require mutual authentication, we cannot follow
redirects at all, even if the servers are capable of authenticating their
redirects.
Would it be possible to either:
  1. Dispatch the `response` hook on redirects
  2. Create a new kind of hook which authentication mechanisms can install specifically for handling redirects?
I see problems with option 1. If we'd be amenable to option 2, I'll work on a
pull request for it. Unless someone says otherwise I'd call the hook
`redirect`.
