User: I am afraid that my question may be duplicate, but I could not find good answers for my question in stackoverflow.
I use PyDev under Eclipse. And I often run my programs by opening a Python Console (Ctrl+Alt+Enter on the editor) for quick-and-easy debugging. The thing is I do not know how to stop the running program on the way. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, or Ctrl+Break did not work. If I click [terminate] icon, the whole Console disappears, in which I do not want.
Is there any ways to stop the running program and go back to command line?
Thanks
Assistant: Ctrl+Alt+F9 should terminate all launches, which will do the job for you.
