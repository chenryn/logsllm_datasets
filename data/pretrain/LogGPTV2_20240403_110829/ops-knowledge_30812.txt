I am concerned that my question may be a duplicate, but I have not found a satisfactory answer on Stack Overflow. I use PyDev within the Eclipse environment and frequently run my programs by opening a Python Console (using Ctrl+Alt+Enter from the editor) for quick and easy debugging. However, I am unable to find a way to stop a running program without closing the entire console. Neither Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, nor Ctrl+Break seem to work. When I click the [terminate] button, the entire console closes, which is not what I want.

Is there a method to halt the running program and return to the command line without closing the console?

Thank you.

**Response:**

To terminate the running program and return to the command line without closing the console, you can try using **Ctrl+Alt+F9**. This will stop all active launches, allowing you to continue using the console.
