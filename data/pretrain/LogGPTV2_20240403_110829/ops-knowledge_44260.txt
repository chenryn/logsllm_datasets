Question: Your organization has implemented the Blocking Untrusted Fonts feature and is running it in Audit mode. The IT manager claims that this will cause immediate usability issues due to the blocking of untrusted fonts. What would be the best counterargument to this claim?
"A": "The Audit mode does not block fonts from loading; it only logs them, so there should be no immediate usability issues.",
"B": "The Audit mode increases the risk of EOP attacks, thus causing more usability issues due to increased security measures.",
"C": "Turning on the feature, even in Audit mode, will block all fonts indiscriminately, trusted or untrusted, leading to system-wide font issues.",
"D": "Audit mode will prevent any fonts from being installed on the system, whether from '%windir%/Fonts' or any other directories."
Answer: A
