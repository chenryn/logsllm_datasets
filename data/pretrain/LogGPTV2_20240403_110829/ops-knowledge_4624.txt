Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Timestamp: 2015-10-18 18:01:50.556

Thread: main
Component: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.event.AsyncDispatcher
Message: Registering class org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.jobhistory.EventType for class org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.jobhistory.JobHistoryEventHandler
Epoch Timestamp: 1445162510
```

This format clearly separates each piece of information, making it easier to read and understand.
