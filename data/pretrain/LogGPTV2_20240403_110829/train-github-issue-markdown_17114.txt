Symfony version | 3.3.2  
We ran into a bug in the handling of periods in an API end point URL.
This query wouldn't work due to the period in faculty.position. This is the
expected behavior since this is how it works in production.  
`$response = $this->get('/sample?faculty.position=Teacher');`
This one should act similarly to the above but it actually handles it. I was
thinking that both lines should be consistent on Symfony whether it handles
periods or not.  
`$response = $this->get('/sample', ['faculty.position' => 'Teacher']);`
We fixed this by using camelCase instead of using periods but I wanted to
bring it up in case someone else encounters this.
The actual call to Symfony is:  
`$this->client()->request($method, $uri, $parameters);`  
which is within Client.php in the framework.
