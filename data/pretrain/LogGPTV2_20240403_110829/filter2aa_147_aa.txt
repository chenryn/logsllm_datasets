### I Know What You Are By the Smell of Your Wi-Fi

Today, we will discuss a mechanism that identifies the type of device connecting to a Wi-Fi network. This mechanism can be highly specific, distinguishing between an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 5s, a Samsung Galaxy S7 and an S8, or even a Withings scale and a Nest Thermostat.

Traditionally, this kind of client detection would be called "fingerprinting," similar to OS fingerprinting in nmap. However, the term "fingerprinting" now typically refers to identifying specific users, such as through browser fingerprinting. Since the word "fingerprinting" also implies individual identification, and our mechanism identifies the device type rather than a unique individual, we refer to it as **Wi-Fi Taxonomy**. It classifies the species of the device, not the unique individual. We will have a chance to try it out during the Q&A session at the end.

### MAC Sublayer Management Entity (MLME)

The mechanism works by examining Wi-Fi Management frames, known as MLME frames. These frames are used for joining, leaving, and configuring the Wi-Fi network. They are not TCP/IP packets, are not routable, and do not leave the Wi-Fi network.

We will focus on two specific frames:
1. **Probe Request**: A client asks nearby Access Points (APs) to respond. The client includes information about itself and its capabilities in the request, and the AP can respond with its own capabilities.
2. **Association Request**: When a client joins a Wi-Fi network, it includes many of the same capabilities as in the Probe Request, plus a few more.

There are other types of MLME frames, such as Authentication frames or Action frames for adjusting various parameters, but the Taxonomy mechanism we are discussing today relies on these two.

### Signature: Information Elements

Information Elements (IEs) are Type-Length-Value tuples packed one after another in the management frame. While they are all optional, some are universal because Wi-Fi cannot function without them. Each Wi-Fi standard has added more IEs over time. For example, 802.11b had very few, while 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac added more.

In addition to standard elements, vendors can define their own extensions. Vendor extensions are type 221 and include an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). This is followed by a subtype, allowing the vendor to define multiple extensions. Any Wi-Fi device can interoperate whether it understands the vendor extensions or not, as it can skip over those it doesn't implement.

For example, the Association Request from an iPhone 7+ includes the SSID the client wants to join, information about supported rates and channels, power levels, and radio management capabilities, plus three vendor extensions from Microsoft, Broadcom, and Apple. Some vendor extensions, like the Microsoft and Broadcom ones, are extremely widespread.

The signature lists the tag numbers of the IEs present in the frame, in the order they appear, as a text string of decimal numbers. For vendor extensions, it includes the OUI of the vendor and the subtype. This part of the signature is most influenced by the client's operating system and Wi-Fi chipset.

### Signature: Capability Bitmasks

In addition to the tag numbers, some IEs contain capability bitmasks or other information useful for identifying the device. For example:
- **802.11n and 802.11ac Capabilities**: These define bits for optional capabilities, strongly influenced by the chipset and the subset of the standard implemented by the ASIC.
- **TX Power IE**: This depends on the board design and antenna layout. Two devices from the same manufacturer, using the same software and Wi-Fi chipset, may have different TX Power values due to different board designs.
- **Number of Antennas**: Encoded in 802.11n and 802.11ac capabilities, indicating the board design.
- **Extended Capabilities Bitmask**: Contains more optional elements, influenced by the driver and WPA supplicant software.

These capability bitmasks are appended to the signature to further differentiate it.

### Distinctiveness Over Time

The signature has become more complex over time. Here are the Association Request portions of the signatures for three devices:
- **iPhone (2007)**: 0,1,48,50
- **iPhone 4s (2011)**: 0,1,48,50,45,221(001018,2),221(00904c,51),221(0050f2,2), htcap:0100,htagg:19,htmcs:000000ff
- **iPhone 7 (2016)**: 0,1,33,36,48,70,54,45,127,191,199,221(0017f2,10),221(001018,2),221(0050f2,2), htcap:006f,htagg:17,htmcs:0000ffff, vhtcap:0f811032,vhtrxmcs:0000fffa,vhttxmcs:0000fffa,txpow:13f9,extcap:000008

### Signatures in Their Final Form

The full signature includes the list of IEs and various bitmasks from both the Probe Request and the Association Request, separated by a pipe. The whole thing is prefixed with "wifi4" to indicate the fourth iteration of the signature format. This allows earlier formats (wifi1, wifi2, and wifi3) to remain in the database while updating.

For example:
- **Xbox One**: wifi4|probe:0,1,45,50,htcap:058f,htagg:03,htmcs:0000ffff|assoc:0,1,33,36,221(0050f2,2),45,htcap:058f,htagg:03,htmcs:0000ffff,txpow:1208
- **Nest Thermostat v3**: wifi4|probe:0,1,45,221(001018,2),221(00904c,51),htcap:0062,htagg:1a,htmcs:000000ff|assoc:0,1,33,36,48,45,221(001018,2),221(00904c,51),221(0050f2,2),htcap:0062,htagg:1a,htmcs:000000ff,txpow:0f09
- **Chromecast v1**: wifi4|probe:0,1,3,45,50,htcap:0120,htagg:03,htmcs:00000000|assoc:0,1,48,50,127,221(0050f2,2),45,htcap:012c,htagg:03,htmcs:000000ff,extcap:0000000000000140

### Mobile Only!

Wi-Fi Taxonomy identifies the Wi-Fi circuitry, device driver, and OS. It works well for highly integrated devices like mobile and IoT devices. For laptops and desktops with separate Wi-Fi cards, it identifies the card. However, this can be less distinctive, so we do not add signatures from these devices to the database to avoid confusion.

We focus on common devices, using lists of top-selling electronics to target what we gather signatures for. We also exclude labels for devices that might make users uncomfortable if seen in the router UI, such as medical devices, adult devices, and home incarceration monitoring.

### Multiple Signatures

Many devices emit more than one signature, leading to multiple entries in the database. For devices supporting both 2.4 and 5 GHz operation, the signatures are almost always distinct, as there are IEs defined for one or the other frequency band.
