### Summary of System Log (2008-11-10)

**Overview:**
The system log for 2008-11-10 records a series of events related to the addition of 20 data blocks to the `invalidSet` in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The logs are primarily generated by the `dfs.FSNamesystem` component, which is responsible for managing the namespace and block management in HDFS.

**Key Events:**

1. **Block Serving:**
   - **Timestamp:** 2008-11-10 09:46:57
   - **Log Level:** INFO
   - **Process ID:** 7835
   - **Component:** dfs.DataNode$DataXceiver
   - **Content:** The DataNode served block `blk_-2285729896739318683` to the client at IP address `10.251.70.5`.

2. **Block Deletions:**
   - **Timestamps:** 2008-11-10 10:30:26 to 2008-11-10 10:30:41
   - **Log Level:** INFO
   - **Process ID:** 34
   - **Component:** dfs.FSNamesystem
   - **Content:** The `NameSystem.delete` method added 20 blocks to the `invalidSet` of various DataNodes. Each entry specifies the block ID and the IP address of the DataNode where the block was marked as invalid. The list of blocks and their corresponding DataNode IP addresses is as follows:

     - `blk_-1233005817943453613` -> `10.251.75.49:50010`
     - `blk_-8736461628840265232` -> `10.251.195.70:50010`
     - `blk_166171721314010075` -> `10.251.30.85:50010`
     - `blk_-3362838757940877177` -> `10.250.5.161:50010`
     - `blk_-8026264173633579073` -> `10.251.214.18:50010`

     - `blk_-4702684774678057084` -> `10.250.13.240:50010`
     - `blk_434034567989619521` -> `10.251.91.15:50010`
     - `blk_413552235254424009` -> `10.251.35.1:50010`
     - `blk_7177118590277025973` -> `10.251.121.224:50010`
     - `blk_2576408434603492552` -> `10.251.106.37:50010`
     - `blk_356592557993755459` -> `10.251.109.236:50010`
     - `blk_9111860234027679206` -> `10.251.39.209:50010`
     - `blk_5178539130945718870` -> `10.251.107.19:50010`
     - `blk_-1331750856499198500` -> `10.251.38.53:50010`
     - `blk_-3792836284792472725` -> `10.251.106.50:50010`
     - `blk_6031076349976322578` -> `10.251.67.225:50010`
     - `blk_4438674026376140804` -> `10.251.106.50:50010`
     - `blk_1777689952069868672` -> `10.251.31.85:50010`

**Conclusion:**
The log entries indicate that a single block was served to a client, followed by a series of block deletions, where 20 blocks were marked as invalid across multiple DataNodes. This suggests that the HDFS cluster was undergoing maintenance or cleanup operations to remove or mark faulty or redundant blocks.
