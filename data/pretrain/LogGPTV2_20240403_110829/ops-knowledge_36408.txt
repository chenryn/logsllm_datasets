Question: "Which of the following statements correctly describe the security roles or implications of keybags when performing backups, syncing, or updating iOS and related devices?"
 "A": "The escrow keybag enables an MDM solution to remotely clear a userâ€™s passcode and facilitates syncing with the Finder or iTunes without requiring the user to enter a passcode each time."
 "B": "The backup keybag is protected with a password that undergoes 10 million iterations of PBKDF2, which makes it immune to brute-force attacks parallelised across multiple computers."
 "C": "During an OTA software update, the Secure Enclave generates a single-use unlock token that expires after 8 hours to ensure that the user keybag is only accessible during the update process."
 "D": "iCloud Backup keybag uses asymmetric class keys, which means all backed-up data, regardless of their original Data Protection class, are re-encrypted with these asymmetric keys."
