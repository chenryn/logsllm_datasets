To create a template for the given log line, we can generalize the specific values. Here is the optimized template:

```
Closed socket connection for client /<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT> (no session established for client)
```

In this template:
- `<IP_ADDRESS>` represents the IP address (e.g., `10.10.34.13`).
- `<PORT>` represents the port number (e.g., `54294`).

This template clearly identifies the placeholders for the dynamic parts of the log message.
