Question: "A web application has implemented a 'remember me' feature using tokens to keep users authenticated. Security consultants argue that the tokens must have an expiration to enhance security. What is the best counterargument against indefinitely valid 'remember me' tokens?"
 "A": "Indefinitely valid tokens pose no risk if they are stored securely and the underlying data is encrypted."
 "B": "Tokens that never expire increase the risk of unauthorized access if they are intercepted or stolen, as they remain valid."
 "C": "Having tokens without expiration dates reduces the server load, as it does not have to frequently reauthenticate users."
 "D": "Users prefer the convenience of never having to re-enter credentials, outweighing any potential security concerns."
Answer: B
