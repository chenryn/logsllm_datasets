User: The standard python version of ubuntu 13.04 is python 2.7.
I know that I can call a python script of version 3.3 by calling python3.3 or python3 in terminal instead of only "python", which starts the version 2.7...
e.g. python3 myscript.py
But now I have a version 3.3. script in the system start routine and can only tell the path to the file. The system recognizes it as a python script (in the shebang with #!/usr/bin/python3)
But how to open it with the correct version? It is tried to be opened with the standard python install so it wont work nor even show up.
Assistant: The shebang line #!/usr/bin/python3 should work if sh, bash, etc. is trying to launch your script.
It it is being run from another script as python myscript.py you'll have to find that script and get it to launch the script using python3 myscripy.py
