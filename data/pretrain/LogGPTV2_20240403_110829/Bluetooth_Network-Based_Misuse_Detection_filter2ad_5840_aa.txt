Abstract
Bluetooth, a protocol designed to replace peripheral ca-
bles, has grown steadily over the last ﬁve years and includes
a variety of applications. The Bluetooth protocol operates
on a wide variety of mobile and wireless devices and is
nearly ubiquitous. Several attacks exist that successfully
target and exploit Bluetooth enabled devices. This paper
describes the implementation of a network intrusion detec-
tion system for discovering malicious Bluetooth trafﬁc. The
work improves upon existing techniques, which only detect
a limited set of attacks (based on measuring anomalies in
the power levels of the Bluetooth device). The new method
identiﬁes reconnaissance, denial of service, and informa-
tion theft attacks on Bluetooth enabled devices, using sig-
natures of the attacks. Furthermore, this system includes an
intrusion response component to deﬂect attacks in progress,
based on the attack classiﬁcation.
This paper presents the implementation of the Bluetooth
Intrusion Detection System and demonstrates its detection,
analysis, and response capabilities. The tool includes a vi-
sualization interface to facilitate the understanding of Blue-
tooth enabled attacks. The experimental results show that
the system can signiﬁcantly improve the overall security of
an organization by identifying and responding to threats
posed to the Bluetooth protocol.
1 Introduction
1.1 Bluetooth-Enabled Technology
The Bluetooth Special
Interest Group developed
the Bluetooth wireless communications protocol (IEEE
802.15.1 standard) for a multitude of mobile devices.
In
near ubiquity now, over 15 million Bluetooth radios shipped
per week in 2007, with over 1.8 billion Bluetooth devices in
existence currently.[1, 2] Examples of Bluetooth devices in-
clude smart-phones, handheld computers, hands-free audio
devices, global-positioning devices, and wireless peripher-
als.
Bluetooth devices offer an attractive target for hackers,
because physical access is not required to attack such de-
vice. Furthermore, a multitude of attacks exist that can com-
promise the security of Bluetooth-enabled devices. These
attacks focus primarily on the 1.8 billion devices running
the previous Bluetooth protocol version. This paper pro-
poses a system for detecting malicious attacks on the Blue-
tooth communications protocol.
Bluetooth-enabled devices extend to many critical appli-
cations. Examples include the health care, banking, and
military applications. Following are some examples of the
seriousness of the threat due to attacks on the Bluetooth pro-
tocol.
1.1.1 Health Care Bluetooth-Enabled Technology
The health care industry utilizes Bluetooth technology. The
Bluetooth speciﬁcations provide a generic proﬁle for med-
ical devices.[3] In health care environments, Bluetooth-
enabled devices allow patient mobility. Bluetooth serves as
an attractive protocol for health care administrators because
of its low cost, low power consumption, and robustness.[4]
Bluetooth-enabled devices exist for heart-rate monitors,
glucometers, respirators, hearing aids, sleep monitors, and
patient records.[5] Bluetooth-enabled medical devices re-
quire the highest level of security measures to protect criti-
cal and conﬁdential applications. A denial of service attack
on a ﬂoor of heart-rate monitors could overwhelm a hospi-
tal staff. Intercepting and decoding the packets of a hearing
aid provides the equivalent of an audio bug. Compromising
Bluetooth-enabled devices to reveal hospital records could
compromise private, sensitive, and potentially embarrassing
patient information. While Bluetooth certainly adds con-
venience for patients, vendors must ensure mobile medical
devices comply with the generic Bluetooth Medical Device
Proﬁle and enforce strict security measures.[3] This reality
requires medical facilities to employ a means of detecting
malicious attacks on medical Bluetooth-enabled devices.

1.1.2 Financial Sector Bluetooth-Enabled Technology
Financial establishments have also begun implementing
mobile banking applications utilizing Bluetooth. Mo-
bile banking includes checking account balances on
a Bluetooth-enabled device, paying bills, or using a
Bluetooth-enabled device to make purchases in brick-and-
mortar stores.[6] According to recent research by the Ce-
lent ﬁnancial advisory ﬁrm, 200,000 US households use
some form of mobile banking.[6] By 2010, the market
is expected to grow to 17 million US households.[6] In
Mexico, BBVA Bancomer has deployed more than 13,000
Bluetooth-enabled payment terminals.[7] Mobile banking
provides ﬂexibility and convenience for consumers. How-
ever, mobile banking via Bluetooth presents a risk. A Blue-
tooth initiative by Bank of America resulted in failure when
Air Defense Inc.
security experts intercepted Bluetooth
communications for a wireless ﬁngerprint reader.[8] While
no generic proﬁle for mobile banking exists for Bluetooth,
application developers must design systems with security
in mind and require a protection mechanism for detecting
malicious Bluetooth trafﬁc.
1.1.3 Military Bluetooth-Enabled Technology
The military also suffers from vulnerabilities of the Blue-
tooth protocol. To illustrate the scope of the threat to
the military, a researcher can examine a recent Naval re-
cruiting campaign. As a method of recruiting, the Navy
constructed a system that distributed motivational videos
to nearby Bluetooth devices. The Navy placed the sys-
tem at key locations on 13 different Naval posts. During
a one-month experiment, the program discovered 11,000
unique Bluetooth mobile devices and delivered video to
2,000 devices.[9] Although benign in nature, the program
provides insight into the scope of potential targets. Instead
of distributing benign videos, the program could have de-
livered malware via the same mechanism and with the same
relative ease.
Applications for Bluetooth extend to very sensitive mili-
tary devices and programs. Bluetooth-enabled devices pro-
cess sensitive information such as the exchange of data for
the Common Access Card (CAC).[10] The CAC serves as a
identiﬁcation card that allows a member to access controlled
facilities and services. By transmitting CAC information
over Bluetooth, the military allows the potential capture and
retransmission or decryption of such trafﬁc by hostile at-
tackers. Further, an ongoing program at the Defense Ad-
vanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) includes Blue-
tooth communication for the LANdroids projects.[11] As
wireless robotics, LANdroids attempt to create a secure
wireless mesh network in urban settings. Additionally, the
Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) projects include a
Bluetooth-connected swarm of miniature helicopters.[12]
The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center projects con-
tain a Bluetooth-enabled mobile robot.[13] Even Bluetooth-
enabled devices used for military applications prove poten-
tially vulnerable to different Bluetooth attacks and require
protection mechanisms.
2 Security Features of the Bluetooth Protocol
2.1 Pairing and Authentication Process
In order to communicate securely, Bluetooth devices re-
quire pairing. Pairing requires that devices exchange pro-
tected passkeys in order to create a linkkey used for en-
cryption. The Simple Pairing protocol in the Core Speci-
ﬁcation 2.1 includes signiﬁcant improvements including a
Difﬁe Helman key exchange.[14] However, over 1.8 billion
Bluetooth-enabled devices exist that operate pre-2.1 speci-
ﬁcations.
In the previous speciﬁcations, each device creates an ini-
tialization key based on the Bluetooth MAC address, PIN
passkey, and 128-bit random number.[3] Each device then
uses the initialization key to exchange random words used
in the creation of the linkeys. Following creation of the
linkkeys, each device pair perform mutual authentication.
Should an attacker be able to observe the pairing process,
he can reconstruct the linkkeys to decrypt further trafﬁc be-
tween paired devices.[15, 16]
In response to the discovered protocol weaknesses, the
Bluetooth Special Interest Group developed Secure Sim-
ple Pairing. Simple Pairing uses the Elliptic Curve Difﬁe
Helman public key exchange to protect against passive
eavesdropping.[14] Initially, each device computes a pub-
lic and a private key. However, only the public keys are
transmitted over the radio. Thus, an eavesdropper only has
access to the two public keys and cannot compute either
the private key or the shared Difﬁe-Helman key. Once each
device is authenticated, the key is also used as one of the
variables to create the shared linkkey for encryption. In the
latest Bluetooth speciﬁcation, an encryption key can be re-
created for communication sessions that last longer than 24
hours.
Although Secure Simple Pairing provides protection
against passive eavesdropping,
it provides no addi-
tional protection against the existing man-in-the-middle
attacks.[17] Additionally, Secure Simple Pairing also intro-
duces Near-Field-Communication (NFC) cooperation. By
bringing two devices within a close proximity, the algorithm
allows for automatic pairing.
2.2 Security Modes
While pairing provides the linkkey used for encryption
and authentication, the Link Manager Protocol (LMP) di-

rects the security mode. Four modes exist for Bluetooth
security.[14] In the ﬁrst mode, a device does not initiate se-
curity procedures. In the second mode, a device does not
initiate security procedures prior to the establishment of the
L2CAP connection. In the third mode, the device must ini-
tiate security procedures prior to establishment of the LMP
connection.
In the fourth and ﬁnal mode, the device can
classify security requirements based on authentication and
security required.
Device security in Bluetooth has improved with each re-
lease of the Core Speciﬁcation.[17, 14, 3] But with all new
releases comes the potential for newer attacks. Although se-
curity design and implementation prove important, the next
section addresses some countermeasures a user can take to
decrease the threat posed by Bluetooth-enabled attacks.
2.3 Security Countermeasures
The National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) provides a thorough overview on countermeasures
to prevent Bluetooth attacks. For further reading, NIST pro-
vides the following documentation available at nist.gov.[18]
NIST documents the policies an organization must estab-
lish to protect Bluetooth users from malicious attacks and
increase the relative security of Bluetooth devices.
As described previously, the passkey aids in creation
of the encryption key. As such, the maximum size 16-bit
passkey should always be used. Default passkeys that come
with devices should be modiﬁed to a sufﬁcient length.[18]
To additionally avoid passive eavesdropping attacks, users
must avoid pairing devices in public places.
Because security is optional in the Bluetooth speciﬁca-
tion, users must select the highest level security modes, dis-
able discoverable modes, turn off unnecessary services, and
turn off devices when not in use.[18] Additionally, users
must enable encryption on all broadcasted transmissions
and use the maximum size encryption key. Application
layer security should be coupled with proper Bluetooth us-
age. And users should frequently check vendor information
for updated ﬁrmware for devices.
While countermeasures aid in protection of Bluetooth-
enabled attacks,
they certainly do not provide ultimate
protection. The next section provides an overview of
Bluetooth-enabled attacks.
3 Examples of Bluetooth-Enabled Attacks
Below are a few examples of currently-known attacks on
the Bluetooth protocol.
3.1 HIDattack
The HIDattack, proposed by Mulliner, exploits Blue-
tooth Human Interface Devices (HID), such as mice, key-
boards or joysticks.[19] This attack takes advantage of
ﬂawed HID implementations. The Bluez Linux stack prior
to 2.25, the Windows XP SP2, Widcomm, and Mac OS
X stacks all fail to incorporate low-level security modes in
their Bluetooth HID implementations.[19] Thus, HIDattack
attack either scans for a HID server or waits passively un-
til a user searches for a HID device. In either case, it then
connects to the user and appears to be a legitimate HID de-
vice. While the attack has a low probability of success, it
represents a serious threat if successful.
3.2 CarWhisperer
The CarWhisperer attack targets known vulnerabilities
in hands-free audio devices. The application can inject au-
dio into, and record live audio from, a target device. Her-
furt demonstrated the successful usage of the application in
2005.[20] Manufacturers often implement hands-free audio
devices with default passkeys. The passkey serves as the
secret parameter to create the linkkey in Bluetooth devices
prior to the 2.1 core speciﬁcation. In order to develop tar-
gets, the attack scans for devices that match the appropriate
hands-free-audio class. For those found to match the correct
class, the attack checks the MAC address to determine the
default passkey provided by the manufacturer. This default
passkey is then used to create an RFCOMM connection to
the vulnerable device. The attack then creates a control con-
nection, connecting to the SCO links, which carry the audio
for the Bluetooth device.[20]
3.3 BlueSnarfer
In BlueSnarﬁng, the attacker gains access to remote data
by initiating an OBEX Push.[21] The OBEX Push Proﬁle
(OPP) generally does not require authentication, so the at-
tacker connects without knowledge of the valid passkey.
The attacker then initiates an OBEX Get request for known
ﬁles such as the phone book, device calendar or message
list. Marcel Holtman and Adam Laurie of the Triﬁnite
Group discovered this vulnerability in several devices in late
2003.[21] In 2004, Laurie tested the security of Bluetooth
phones in Parliament. In the course of his experiment, Lau-
rie found 46 vulnerable phones in 15 minutes.[21]
3.4 iPhone MetaSploit
Recently, Kevin Mahaffey and John Hering of Flexilis
Inc. discovered a vulnerability in the Bluetooth implemen-
tation on the iPhone.[22] They successfully managed to in-
troduce an exploit via the Service Discovery Proﬁle (SDP).

Utilizing a specially crafted SDP message, the attacker can
load a framework of tools to attack the entire operating sys-
tem of the phone. Further, the attack enables access to a root
shell on the iPhone device. Mahaffey and Hering also dis-
covered that they could simplify the discovery of the Blue-
tooth MAC Address for the iPhone by passive capture of
WiFi trafﬁc. The MAC address captured in WiFi trafﬁc al-
lows calculation of the Bluetooth MAC address.
3.5 Emerging Trends
The number of Bluetooth attacks have grown steadily
over the last ﬁve years. The F-Secure Corporation currently
has classiﬁed 71 attacks that spread mobile malware via
Bluetooth. Researchers at Virginia Tech have shown how to
combine classic Internet protocol attacks such as the SYN
ﬂood with a Bluetooth distribution scheme.[23]
As the number of attacks have grown, so have the sever-
ity of attacks and the ease of implementation. Repositories
of attacks exist with source code. Because Bluetooth de-
vices are frequently managed by users that are less security
conscious, these devices are more vulnerable to attacks.[18]
With almost 2 billion devices in existence, Bluetooth poses
a risk to most organizations.
Several computers and mobile computing devices now
exist with WiFi, Cellular and Bluetooth protocol interfaces.
The recent attacks on the iPhone demonstrate how hack-
ers can combine weaknesses of each interface to exploit the
overall system. Exposing a vulnerability in any of the pro-
tocol interfaces can lead to a possible vulnerability in the
others. There has been signiﬁcant progress made on intru-
sion detection for WiFi and cellular protocols.[24] This pa-
per therefore examines how to detect and prevent intrusions
on the Bluetooth interface.

Bluetooth trafﬁc based on misuse detection. The follow-
ing discusses related work in intrusion detection, wireless
and mobile threat modeling, and analysis tools.
4.1
Intrusion Detection
Anderson ﬁrst described the concept of an intrusion de-
tection system in 1980.[25] He suggested the use of audit
trails to detect intrusive behavior such as unauthorized ac-
cess to ﬁles. Denning then implemented the ﬁrst generic
