**Abstract:**
Bluetooth, a protocol designed to replace peripheral cables, has seen significant growth over the past five years and is now nearly ubiquitous across a wide range of mobile and wireless devices. Despite its widespread use, several attacks have been developed that target and exploit Bluetooth-enabled devices. This paper describes the implementation of a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) for identifying malicious Bluetooth traffic. The proposed method improves upon existing techniques, which are limited to detecting anomalies in power levels, by identifying reconnaissance, denial of service, and information theft attacks using attack signatures. Additionally, the system includes an intrusion response component to mitigate ongoing attacks based on their classification.

This paper presents the design and implementation of the Bluetooth Intrusion Detection System (BIDS), demonstrating its capabilities in detection, analysis, and response. The tool features a visualization interface to enhance the understanding of Bluetooth-based attacks. Experimental results show that BIDS can significantly improve the overall security of organizations by identifying and responding to threats targeting the Bluetooth protocol.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Bluetooth-Enabled Technology
The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) developed the Bluetooth wireless communications protocol (IEEE 802.15.1 standard) for a wide array of mobile devices. In 2007, over 15 million Bluetooth radios were shipped per week, with more than 1.8 billion Bluetooth devices currently in use [1, 2]. Examples of Bluetooth devices include smartphones, handheld computers, hands-free audio devices, global positioning systems, and wireless peripherals.

Bluetooth devices are attractive targets for hackers because physical access is not required to launch an attack. A variety of attacks exist that can compromise the security of Bluetooth-enabled devices, primarily focusing on the 1.8 billion devices running older versions of the Bluetooth protocol. This paper proposes a system for detecting malicious attacks on the Bluetooth communications protocol.

#### 1.1.1 Health Care Bluetooth-Enabled Technology
The healthcare industry widely uses Bluetooth technology. The Bluetooth specifications provide a generic profile for medical devices [3]. In healthcare settings, Bluetooth-enabled devices enhance patient mobility. Administrators favor Bluetooth due to its low cost, low power consumption, and robustness [4]. Medical devices such as heart-rate monitors, glucometers, respirators, hearing aids, sleep monitors, and patient records use Bluetooth [5]. These devices require the highest level of security to protect critical and confidential data. A denial of service attack on a floor of heart-rate monitors could overwhelm hospital staff. Intercepting and decoding packets from a hearing aid could function as an audio bug. Compromising Bluetooth-enabled devices to access hospital records could expose private, sensitive, and potentially embarrassing patient information. While Bluetooth adds convenience, vendors must ensure that mobile medical devices comply with the Bluetooth Medical Device Profile and enforce strict security measures [3]. This necessitates that medical facilities employ methods to detect malicious attacks on Bluetooth-enabled medical devices.

#### 1.1.2 Financial Sector Bluetooth-Enabled Technology
Financial institutions have begun implementing mobile banking applications using Bluetooth. Mobile banking allows users to check account balances, pay bills, and make purchases in brick-and-mortar stores via Bluetooth-enabled devices [6]. According to research by Celent, 200,000 US households used some form of mobile banking in 2008, with the market expected to grow to 17 million US households by 2010 [6]. In Mexico, BBVA Bancomer has deployed over 13,000 Bluetooth-enabled payment terminals [7]. While mobile banking offers flexibility and convenience, it also presents security risks. For example, a Bluetooth initiative by Bank of America failed when Air Defense Inc. security experts intercepted Bluetooth communications from a wireless fingerprint reader [8]. Although no generic profile exists for mobile banking, application developers must prioritize security and implement mechanisms to detect malicious Bluetooth traffic.

#### 1.1.3 Military Bluetooth-Enabled Technology
The military also faces vulnerabilities related to the Bluetooth protocol. A recent Naval recruiting campaign illustrates the potential threat. The Navy used a system to distribute motivational videos to nearby Bluetooth devices at key locations on 13 different Naval posts. During a one-month experiment, the program discovered 11,000 unique Bluetooth mobile devices and delivered videos to 2,000 devices [9]. While this program was benign, it highlights the scope of potential targets. Malware could be distributed through the same mechanism with relative ease.

Bluetooth is used in highly sensitive military applications, such as the exchange of data for the Common Access Card (CAC) [10]. The CAC serves as an identification card, allowing members to access controlled facilities and services. Transmitting CAC information over Bluetooth exposes it to potential capture and retransmission or decryption by hostile attackers. Additionally, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) uses Bluetooth in the LANdroids project, which aims to create a secure wireless mesh network in urban settings [11]. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) projects include a Bluetooth-connected swarm of miniature helicopters [12], and the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center projects involve a Bluetooth-enabled mobile robot [13]. Even in military applications, Bluetooth-enabled devices are vulnerable to various attacks and require protection mechanisms.

## 2. Security Features of the Bluetooth Protocol

### 2.1 Pairing and Authentication Process
To communicate securely, Bluetooth devices must be paired. Pairing involves exchanging protected passkeys to create a linkkey used for encryption. The Simple Pairing protocol in the Core Specification 2.1 includes significant improvements, such as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange [14]. However, over 1.8 billion Bluetooth-enabled devices still operate on pre-2.1 specifications.

In earlier specifications, each device creates an initialization key based on the Bluetooth MAC address, PIN passkey, and a 128-bit random number [3]. The devices then use the initialization key to exchange random words for creating the linkkeys. After the linkkeys are created, the device pairs perform mutual authentication. If an attacker observes the pairing process, they can reconstruct the linkkeys to decrypt further traffic between paired devices [15, 16].

In response to these weaknesses, the Bluetooth SIG developed Secure Simple Pairing. This method uses the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman public key exchange to protect against passive eavesdropping [14]. Each device computes a public and private key, but only the public keys are transmitted. An eavesdropper cannot compute the private key or the shared Diffie-Hellman key. Once authenticated, the key is used to create the shared linkkey for encryption. In the latest Bluetooth specification, an encryption key can be recreated for communication sessions lasting longer than 24 hours.

While Secure Simple Pairing protects against passive eavesdropping, it does not provide additional protection against man-in-the-middle attacks [17]. It also introduces Near-Field-Communication (NFC) cooperation, allowing automatic pairing when two devices are brought into close proximity.

### 2.2 Security Modes
The Link Manager Protocol (LMP) directs the security mode in Bluetooth. Four security modes exist:
1. No security procedures are initiated.
2. Security procedures are not initiated before the L2CAP connection is established.
3. Security procedures must be initiated before the LMP connection is established.
4. Security requirements are classified based on authentication and security needed.

Device security in Bluetooth has improved with each release of the Core Specification [17, 14, 3]. However, new releases also introduce the potential for new attacks. While security design and implementation are crucial, the next section discusses countermeasures to reduce the threat posed by Bluetooth-enabled attacks.

### 2.3 Security Countermeasures
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides comprehensive guidance on countermeasures to prevent Bluetooth attacks. NIST documents the policies organizations must establish to protect Bluetooth users and increase device security [18].

Users should always use the maximum 16-bit passkey and avoid default passkeys. To prevent passive eavesdropping, pairing should not occur in public places. Since security is optional in the Bluetooth specification, users must select the highest security modes, disable discoverable modes, turn off unnecessary services, and power off devices when not in use [18]. Encryption should be enabled for all broadcasted transmissions, and the maximum size encryption key should be used. Application layer security should complement proper Bluetooth usage, and users should regularly check for firmware updates.

While these countermeasures help, they do not provide ultimate protection. The next section provides an overview of known Bluetooth-enabled attacks.

## 3. Examples of Bluetooth-Enabled Attacks

### 3.1 HID Attack
The HID attack, proposed by Mulliner, exploits Bluetooth Human Interface Devices (HID) like mice, keyboards, and joysticks [19]. This attack takes advantage of flawed HID implementations in the Bluez Linux stack (prior to 2.25), Windows XP SP2, Widcomm, and Mac OS X stacks [19]. The attack either scans for a HID server or waits until a user searches for a HID device, then connects and appears legitimate. Although the success rate is low, the threat is serious if successful.

### 3.2 CarWhisperer
The CarWhisperer attack targets vulnerabilities in hands-free audio devices. The application can inject and record live audio from a target device. Herfurt demonstrated the successful use of this application in 2005 [20]. Manufacturers often use default passkeys, which serve as the secret parameter to create the linkkey in Bluetooth devices prior to the 2.1 core specification. The attack scans for devices matching the appropriate hands-free-audio class, checks the MAC address for the default passkey, and creates an RFCOMM connection to the vulnerable device. It then establishes a control connection to the SCO links, which carry the audio [20].

### 3.3 BlueSnarfer
In BlueSnarfing, the attacker gains remote data access by initiating an OBEX Push [21]. The OBEX Push Profile (OPP) typically does not require authentication, allowing the attacker to connect without a valid passkey. The attacker then requests known files such as the phone book, device calendar, or message list. Marcel Holtman and Adam Laurie of the Triﬁnite Group discovered this vulnerability in several devices in late 2003 [21]. In 2004, Laurie tested the security of Bluetooth phones in Parliament and found 46 vulnerable phones in 15 minutes [21].

### 3.4 iPhone MetaSploit
Kevin Mahaffey and John Hering of Flexilis Inc. discovered a vulnerability in the Bluetooth implementation on the iPhone [22]. They successfully introduced an exploit via the Service Discovery Profile (SDP). Using a specially crafted SDP message, the attacker can load a framework of tools to attack the entire operating system and gain root shell access. They also found that the Bluetooth MAC address could be calculated from the WiFi MAC address captured in WiFi traffic.

### 3.5 Emerging Trends
The number of Bluetooth attacks has grown steadily over the past five years. F-Secure Corporation has classified 71 attacks that spread mobile malware via Bluetooth. Researchers at Virginia Tech have shown how to combine classic Internet protocol attacks, such as the SYN flood, with a Bluetooth distribution scheme [23].

As the number of attacks has increased, so has their severity and ease of implementation. Repositories of attacks with source code are available. Bluetooth devices, often managed by less security-conscious users, are more vulnerable to attacks [18]. With nearly 2 billion devices in use, Bluetooth poses a significant risk to most organizations.

Many computers and mobile devices now support WiFi, Cellular, and Bluetooth protocols. Recent attacks on the iPhone demonstrate how hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in one interface to compromise others. Significant progress has been made in intrusion detection for WiFi and cellular protocols [24]. This paper examines how to detect and prevent intrusions on the Bluetooth interface.

## 4. Related Work

This paper presents a method for detecting malicious Bluetooth traffic based on misuse detection. The following sections discuss related work in intrusion detection, wireless and mobile threat modeling, and analysis tools.

### 4.1 Intrusion Detection
Anderson first described the concept of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in 1980 [25], suggesting the use of audit trails to detect intrusive behavior such as unauthorized file access. Denning later implemented the first generic IDS [26].
