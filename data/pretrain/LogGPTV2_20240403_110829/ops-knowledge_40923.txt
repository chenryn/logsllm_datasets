User: I just downloaded and installed Python 2.7.2 to my laptop and I am trying to run some sample programs. My laptop is running Windows XP.
When I open a cmd window and type python I get:

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

I am not a Windows person (mostly mainframes). However I am guessing that there is some command that I need to execute to define python as a command. Can anyone tell me what that command is?
The installer placed Python at C:\Python27\.
Assistant: Just another clarification for those starting out. When you add C:\PythonXX to your path, make sure there are NO SPACES between variables e.g. 
This:
SomeOtherDirectory;C:\Python27
Not this:
SomeOtherDirectory; C:\Python27
That took me a good 15 minutes of headache to figure out (I'm on windows 7, might be OS dependent). Happy coding.
