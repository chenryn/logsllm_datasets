User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题NtpClient will wait 3473457 minutes (over 6 years!) before it will do a new attempt of DNS resolution, eventid 134 I find the message hilarious and at first I thought it was some joke from an over-active programmer of the MS team, or a hoax. However, the message appears again and again, a couple of times a day:


  NtpClient was unable to set a manual peer to use as a time source
  because of DNS resolution error on ''. NtpClient will try again in
  3473457 minutes and double the reattempt interval thereafter. The
  error was: The requested name is valid, but no data of the requested
  type was found. (0x80072AFC)


Source: Time Service
Event ID: 134
Level: Warning

I suspect that my time servers are not configured correctly. Is that true and how can I fix it? But why such an odd message?

Note: I reported this on Technet, where you can find an explanation why the number is so odd (and consequently, two answers found that link too and used it in the answers ;) ).

Assistant: I know it's an old question but my own research came across this post on technet.
It says that the reason for the long delay is due to an output bug in the event viewer. Event viewer is misinterpreting the raw data of the string value &quot;15&quot; in the registry as a number.

You could find the value of registry NtpClient\ResolvePeerBackoffMinutes is 15, the output in the event log is 3473457 = 0x00350031, which is little-endian format of the Unicode string &quot;15&quot;.
