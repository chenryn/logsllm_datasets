Figure 10. Attenuated mini-slot signals. The
ratio of mini-slot signals that are not α-attenuated as
a function of K;  = 10−14.
Note, however,
that the expected value of the ratio
Ka/K is independent of K, and therefore it does not give
any useful information about the role of K and what value
we should choose for it. We next study this aspect. Let us
denote with K (K ≤ K) the smallest threshold for which
the following holds
(cid:17)K
(9)
P [Ka ≤ K] ≥ 1 −  ,
where  ∈ [0, 1]. Note that P [Ka ≤ K] =
k=0 P [Ka =
k], with P [Ka = k] given by (7). Note further that
P [Ka ≤ K] is related to a single time interval Ts during
which the symbol “1” is transmitted. By the independence,
the probability P n[Ka ≤ K] that Ka ≤ K after n symbol
“1” transmissions (n time intervals Ts) satisﬁes
−n ,
P n[Ka ≤ K] ≥ (1 − )n ≈ e
where the last approximation is valid for small . For the
−n is reasonably close to
given n, by choosing  such that e
1, we essentially make K an “upper bound” on the number
of mini-slot signals that are α-attenuated in any given time
slot Ts (out of the total of n slots). Likewise, (K − K)
provides a “lower bound” on the number of mini-slot sig-
nals that are not α-attenuated.
In Figure 10, we plot the ratio (1 − K/K) of the mini-
slot signals that are not α-attenuated as a function of K,
−n ≈ 0.9999,
for  = 10−14. For n = 1010, we have e
i.e., even after as many as 1010 transmissions of the symbol
“1”, the probability that Ka ≤ K is at least 0.9999. If we
transmit on average one symbol “1” per second (meaning
that we do nothing else but transmitting such signals), then
it takes around 310 years to see all the n symbols. In this
case, the smallest K for which the bound (9) holds, is a rea-
sonable upper bound on Ka. Coming back to Figure 10, we
can see that if K is set too low, we cannot hope to achieve

a very high ratio of non α-attenuated mini-slot signals for
all the n transmissions of the symbol “1”. Therefore, K
should be chosen based on the expected α and the desired
ratio 1 − K/K.
6.3 Energy Content of the Emitted Sig-
nals
We already argued that it is reasonable to model the
phase shift as a random variable Θ ∈ [0, 2π).
It is then
interesting to calculate the energy of the resulting random
signal. Let us deﬁne a random process R(t) = cos(ω0t) −
cos(ω0t − Θ). We will calculate the energy of this process
when Θ has uniform distribution on [0, 2π).
2π , ∀θ ∈ [0, 2π). The energy content
ER of the random process R(t), within the time interval T ,
is deﬁned as [20]:

Plugging this into the expression (10), we obtain:

where (1) is valid for high frequencies f0, since −1 ≤
sin(·) ≤ 1 implies sin(·)/(4ω0) = sin(·)/(8πf0) → 0.
Therefore, on average, the adversary only increases the
energy of the resulting signal r(t); the energy content of
r(t) without the adversary is T /2 (Figure 8)!
From the analysis in this section, we conclude that we
can easily ensure that the adversary cannot block the sym-
bol “1” emitted over a radio channel, even under very ad-
vantageous assumptions for him (i.e., no multipath fading
effects, perfect estimate of signal amplitudes, etc.).
7 Related work
In this context, Stajano and Anderson propose the res-
urrecting duckling security policy model, [21] and [22], in
which key establishment is based on the physical contact
between communicating parties (their PDAs). A physical
contact acts as a location limited channel, which can be used
to transmit a key (or a secret) in plaintext. Thus, no cryp-
tography is required at this stage. The potential drawback
of this approach is that the realization of physical contact
can be cumbersome with bulky devices (e.g., laptops).
An approach inspired by the resurrecting duckling se-
curity policy model is proposed by Balfanz et al. [4].
In
this work, the authors relax the requirement that the loca-
tion limited channel has to be secure against passive eaves-
dropping; they introduce the notion of a location-limited
channel. A location-limited channel is used to exchange
pre-authentication data and should be resistant to active at-
tacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle). Once pre-authentication
data are exchanged over a location-limited channel, users
switch to a common radio channel and run any standard
key exchange protocol over it. Possible candidates for a
location-limited channel include: physical contact, infrared,
and ultrasound [4]. Here again, the disadvantage of this ap-
proach is that it may be cumbersome to realize a link with
bulky devices (e.g., laptops) in the case of infrared or phys-
ical contact. Our key establishment mechanisms based on
I-codes enable key establishment over a radio channel in
a more practical way for the user as no physical contact is
required.
Asokan and Ginzboorg propose another solution based
on a shared password [3]. They consider the problem of
setting up a session key between a group of people (i.e.,
their computers) who get together in a meeting room and
who share no prior context except a fresh password.
In most IT security systems the weakest links are the
users. People are slow and unreliable when dealing with
meaningless strings, and they have difﬁculties remembering
strong passwords. In [19], Perrig and Song suggest using
hash visualization to improve the security of such systems.
Hash visualization is a technique that replaces meaningless
strings with structured images. However, having to compare
complex images can be cumbersome.
In US patent no. 5,450,493 [15], Maher presents sev-
eral methods to verify DH public parameters exchanged
between users. This technique had a ﬂaw, discovered by
Jakobsson [12]. Motivated by the ﬂaw, Larsson and Jakobs-
son [12] proposed two solutions based on a temporary secret
shared between the two users.
In [10] and [11], Gehrmann et al., propose a set of tech-
niques to enable wireless devices to authenticate one an-
other via an insecure radio channel with the aid of the man-
ual transfer of data between the devices. In [23], we pro-
pose an optimal message authenticator, a more efﬁcient pro-
tocol that enables provably secure authentication through
the transfer of a short bit sequence over an authenticated
channel. We further propose a set of simple techniques for
key establishment over a radio link in peer-to-peer networks
based on the Difﬁe-Hellman key agreement protocol.

In [2], Alpern and Schneider present a protocol that al-
lows two parties to agree on a secret key on channels for
which an adversary cannot tell who is the source of each
message. It is a pairing scheme that does not rely on public-
key cryptography. As a follow-up, in [8], Castelluccia and
Mutaf propose two movement-based pairing protocols for
CPU-constrained devices. We should mention the work of
Corner and Noble [9], who consider the problem of tran-
sient authentication between a user and his device, as well
as the work of ˇCapkun et al. [24], where the authors show
how to make use of users mobility to bootstrap secure com-
munication in ad hoc networks. Finally, we acknowledge
the contribution of Perrig et al. in [18], where the authors
propose Tesla, a protocol for broadcast authentication based
on delayed key disclosure.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced integrity (I) codes for a ra-
dio channel, a novel mechanism that enables integrity pro-
tection of messages exchanged between entities that do not
hold any mutual authentication material (i.e. public keys
or shared secret keys). We have analyzed I-codes in de-
tail and we have shown that they are secure in a realistic
attacker model. We further introduced a novel mechanism,
called authentication through presence based on I-codes.
We demonstrated the use of this mechanism in two appli-
cation scenarios: broadcast authentication and key estab-
lishment. We implemented I-codes on the Mica2 wireless
sensor platform. We demonstrated that I-codes can be im-
plemented efﬁciently and without the use of any specialized
hardware.
