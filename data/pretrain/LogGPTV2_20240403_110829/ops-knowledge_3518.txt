Confirm that IIS has been installed: Find "Programs and Features" in the Control Panel, then select "Turn Windows features on or off", check the Select the "Internet Information Services (IIS)" option to ensure that IIS is installed. 2.

In summary, the steps above describe how to deploy and configure IIS to run ASP.NET applications on a Windows server.
