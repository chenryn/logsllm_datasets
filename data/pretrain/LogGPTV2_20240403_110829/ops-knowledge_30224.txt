Question: Consider a secure Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm in use. An attacker, Eve, is attempting to undermine the integrity of the communication between Alice and Bob. What are the potential outcomes of Eve's actions given the security properties of a secure MAC, and what is she unable to achieve?
"A": "Eve can observe a valid MAC for a message and use it to generate a valid MAC for a new, unseen message.",
"B": "Eve can modify a message and the corresponding MAC in such a way that Bob accepts the modified message as authentic.",
"C": "Eve, by knowing some valid MACs, cannot forge valid MACs for messages she has never observed before.",
"D": "Eve can choose a set of messages and have Alice transmit those with valid MACs, which will help her to forge a valid MAC for a new message."
Answer: C
