User: I am running Python on a Raspberry Pi and everything works great.
I have a small script running on the system start up which prints several warning messages (which I actually cannot read since it is running in the background)...
My question is: Is there a way via SSH to "open" this running script instance and see what is going on or a log file is the only way to work with that?
Thanks!
Assistant: You should modify your python script to write its output to a file instead of to the screen (which you can't see). I.e., I think that a log file is your best (possibly only) bet. You can write to a file in /tmp on the raspberry pi if you just want a temporary log file that you can check once and a while.
Also, as Tim said, you could try out the python logging library, but I think just writing to a file is quicker and easier, although you might run into some issues with permissions...
