### Issue Type: Bug Report

### Ansible Version: 1.6.6

### Environment: OS X 10.9.4

### Summary
The output contains duplicate entries when using a "when" conditional for a variable.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Use a "when" conditional for a variable in the playbook.
2. Run the playbook.

### Expected Results
Ansible should be able to parse and act upon the result of testing the variable without any syntax errors.

### Actual Results
The error message contains duplicate information:
```
ERROR: Syntax Error while loading YAML script, roundcube.yml  
Note: The error may actually appear before this position: line 129, column 28
    command: /usr/sbin/setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1
    when: "{{rc_db_host}}" == "localhost"
                           ^
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with unbalanced quotes. If starting a value with a quote, make sure the line ends with the same set of quotes. For instance, this arbitrary example:
    foo: "bad" "wolf"
Could be written as:
    foo: '"bad" "wolf"'
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they start a value. For instance:
    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}
Should be written as:
    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"

    foo: "bad" "wolf"

    foo: '"bad" "wolf"'
```

### Additional Information
- The error message suggests that the issue might be due to unbalanced or missing quotes.
- The `when` condition should be properly quoted to avoid syntax errors. For example:
  ```yaml
  when: "{{ rc_db_host }}" == "localhost"
  ```

### Suggested Fix
Ensure that all template expressions are properly quoted and that there are no unbalanced quotes in the playbook.
