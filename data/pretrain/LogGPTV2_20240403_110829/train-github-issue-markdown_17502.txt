We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with  
unbalanced quotes. If starting a value with a quote, make sure the  
line ends with the same set of quotes. For instance this arbitrary  
example:
    foo: "bad" "wolf"
Could be written as:
    foo: '"bad" "wolf"'
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with  
missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they  
start a value. For instance:
    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}
Should be written as:
    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"
