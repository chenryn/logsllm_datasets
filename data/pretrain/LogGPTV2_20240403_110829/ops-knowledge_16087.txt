Question: When designing a security testing guide for mobile applications, why might a security expert recommend including platform-independent security measures?
"A": "Because platform-independent security measures provide a consistent baseline for all mobile apps regardless of the underlying operating system.",
"B": "Because platform-specific security measures are too complex to implement across different operating systems.",
"C": "Because all mobile operating systems are essentially the same and do not require tailored security measures.",
"D": "Because platform-independent security measures are less important and therefore easier to test."
Answer: A
