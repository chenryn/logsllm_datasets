Since #41225 I'm no longer able to augment the static side of `class Module`.
Before it was possible as indicated there: #40927 (comment)

  * I tried using the `@types/node` package and had problems.
  * I tried using the latest stable version of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
  * I have a question that is inappropriate for StackOverflow. (Please ask any appropriate questions there).
  * Mention the authors (see `Definitions by:` in `index.d.ts`) so they can respond.
