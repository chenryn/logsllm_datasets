## Context
We ‚ù§Ô∏ènext.js! I made the (possibly) poor decision of migrating our (nteract's)
monorepo to Webpack 4 only to notice that next.js is on webpack 3. How far off
is a migration to webpack 4? My primary reason for asking is to know if I
should switch us _back_ to webpack 3 or just wait on the next next version. üòÑ
We have a few non-next.js apps (some loaded by a python server, one by
electron) and we want to make the webpack similar using the universal webpack
configurator plugins crafted for next 4. I don't want to break our next apps,
so I kept those a bit separate.
