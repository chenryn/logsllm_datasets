User: I am having a problem that has baffled me for over a week.   I have a project that is written in python with Django on Google App Engine.   The project has a login page and when I run the application in Google App Engine or from the command line using dev_server.py c:\project, it works fine.  When I try to run the application through a debugger like Wing or Pycharm, I cannot get past the login page.  After trying to login, it takes me back to the login screen again.   When I look at the logs, it shows a 302 (redirect) in the debugger but normally it shows a 200 (OK).   Could someone explain why this would be happening?
Thanks

Assistant: After a week of racking my brain, I finally figured out the problem.   The gaesessions code was the culprit.   We put DEFAULT_LIFETIME = datetime.timedelta(hours=1) and originally it was DEFAULT_LIFETIME = datetime.timedelta(days=7).   Not sure why running it through any debugger such as wing or pycharm would prevent the browser from getting a session.   The interesting thing is the code change with hours=1 works fine on linux with wing debugger.  Very Strange!
