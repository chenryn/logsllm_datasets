   Early S7CommPlus protocol 
• This talk mainly focus on the current encrypted 
S7CommPlus protocol 
Programmable Logic 
Controllers (PLC) is 
responsible for process 
control in industrial 
control system. A PLC 
contains a Central 
Processing Unit (CPU), 
some digital/analog 
inputs and outputs 
modules, 
communication 
module and some 
process modules like 
PID.

TIA Portal is the configuration and programming software 
for Siemens PLCs.

Replay Attack 
• Replay attacks have been widely used in PLC attacks. 
• Get the communication sequence packets with the help 
of Wireshark 
S7CommPlus Protocol 
• The current S7CommPlus protocol including the 
S7CommPlus Connection packets and S7CommPlus 
Function packets has a similar structure.  
• 1. First Connection Setup Request 
• 2. Frist Connection Setup Response 
• 3.Second Connection Setup Request 
• 4.Function Packet—Stop PLC 
S7CommPlus Protocol 
• Session ID： 
Session ID = Object ID+0x80 
S7CommPlus Protocol 
• Encryption Part： 
1. The second connection packet has two encryptions 
2. The function packet has one encryption（Integrity Part） 
Fun with the Encryption 
• Using reverse debugging techniques, we found these 
encryption is calculated by TIA Portal through a file 
named OMSp_core_managed.dll 
1. Connection packet encryption 
Input parameter for this encryption is a random value array 
generated by the PLC in the first connection response packet. 
Fun with the Encryption 
（1） First encryption in the connection packet 
 Using XOR (we call this Encryption1), the first 
encryption can be calculated with the input 
parameter Value Array. 
Value Array +Encryption1  = First Encryption 
Fun with the Encryption 
（2）Second encryption in the connection packet 
 Using the result of the first encryption as input parameter, 
the second encryption is calculated through a more complex 
Siemens-private algorithm. 
First Encryption +Encryption2  = Second Encryption 
Fun with the Encryption 
2. Function packet encryption 
A fixed field array with Session ID is the input parameter. A 
complex algorithm (we call this Encryption3) is used to 
calculated the encryption result as follow: 
ConstanArray +Encryption3  = Function Encryption 
(with  Session ID) 
Fun with the Encryption 
3. S7CommPlus Communication with Encryption 
Protections 
• Code level: 
-- Use code confusion techniques and anti-Debug 
   techniques for the key DLL files 
• Design level 
-- use a private key as an input parameter for encryption  
    algorithm in the communication between Siemens  
    software and PLCs. 
• Protocol level 
    -- Encrypt the whole packets instead of the key byte  
      encryption
