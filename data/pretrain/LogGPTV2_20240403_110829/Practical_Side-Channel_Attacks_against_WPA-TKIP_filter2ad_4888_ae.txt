# Experimental Analysis and Side-Channel Attacks on WPA-TKIP

## 1. Introduction
We conducted a series of tests to evaluate the security of WPA-TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) in OpenBSD 6.4, using both an Intel AC 8265 card and an AWUS051NH dongle. Our experiments revealed several vulnerabilities that can be exploited through side-channel attacks.

### 1.1 Test Setup and Findings
- **Intel AC 8265 Card**: We were able to replay CCMP (Counter Mode with CBC-MAC Protocol) frames but not TKIP frames. The Intel card only supports hardware decryption for CCMP, making TKIP frame replay impossible.
- **AWUS051NH Dongle**: Both TKIP and CCMP frames could be replayed. Additionally, we confirmed that capturing a single TKIP keystream allows for the injection of an infinite number of packets.
- **Software Decryption Impact**: When using software decryption, the Wi-Fi subsystem of OpenBSD attempts to verify the Michael MIC (Message Integrity Code) of individual TKIP fragments. This results in MIC failures because individual TKIP frames do not have a valid Michael MIC. Consequently, if a legitimate client sends fragmented TKIP frames to OpenBSD, it causes a self-inflicted denial-of-service (DoS).

## 2. Discussion
### 2.1 Impact of Side-Channel Attacks
The side-channel attacks described in this paper represent significant improvements over previously known attacks:
- **Independence from Michael MIC Failure Reports**: Our attacks do not rely on these reports, bypassing existing countermeasures.
- **AP and Client Vulnerability**: Unlike previous attacks, our methods target both access points (APs) and clients. Attacking the AP is advantageous as it simplifies keystream generation.
- **Multicast and Broadcast Traffic**: Several of our attacks target multicast and broadcast traffic, making even modern AES-CCMP clients vulnerable in networks supporting TKIP.

#### 2.1.1 Injecting Network Traffic
Our attacks enable an adversary to recover a keystream and the Michael MIC key, allowing them to inject network traffic. The process involves:
1. Calculating the Michael MIC using the recovered key.
2. Calculating the ICV (Integrity Check Value) as a CRC-32.
3. Encrypting the result using the recovered keystream.
4. Injecting the forged message onto a QoS channel with a lower TSC (Transmit Sequence Counter) value.

Once the Michael MIC key is recovered, additional keystreams can be generated more quickly, as only the last 4 bytes (ICV) need to be decrypted.

#### 2.1.2 Decrypting Network Traffic
The Michael MIC key can also be used to decrypt frames. This is achieved by sending a ping-style packet to the victim and using the Michael reset attack to append an encrypted TKIP frame to the ping request. By spoofing the source IP, the victim's response is directed to a server under the attacker's control, effectively decrypting the frame.

### 2.2 Countermeasures
We identified two potential countermeasures against our side-channel attacks:
1. **Reducing Rekeying Interval**: Setting the rekeying interval to one minute can prevent the execution of attacks. However, this increases network overhead and may not be ideal.
2. **Software Implementation Changes**: A naive solution is to prevent fragmented frames from influencing the receiver's state. However, this is impractical as fragmented frames must be stored for reassembly. Instead, we propose dropping all fragmented frames and atomically decrypting and authenticating other TKIP frames. This requires disabling hardware decryption, which may not be feasible due to the effort required and the outdated nature of TKIP.

### 2.3 Applicability to CCMP
CCMP, introduced as a more robust security protocol, uses the counter mode in the AES block cipher for data confidentiality and CBC-MAC for data integrity. Key differences between CCMP and TKIP include:
- **MIC Calculation**: CCMP calculates a MIC for every MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit), while TKIP attaches its Michael MIC only to the last fragment or MPDU.
- **ICV**: CCMP does not use an ICV, unlike TKIP.
- **Data Integrity Verification**: Each decrypted CCMP MPDU is immediately verified for data integrity, whereas TKIP fragments are processed before being reassembled.

These differences make CCMP less susceptible to the side-channel attacks that work against TKIP.

### 2.4 Future Work
Future research could explore:
- **Proprietary Implementations**: Reverse engineering proprietary Wi-Fi stacks to identify similar vulnerabilities.
- **Cache-Based Side-Channel Attacks**: Investigating the possibility of breaking TKIP implementations using cache-based side-channels, particularly in scenarios where unprivileged code can be executed on the victim's machine.
- **Timing-Based Attacks**: Examining whether timing-based side-channel attacks can determine the correctness of the TKIP ICV, especially on resource-constrained devices.

- **Ohigashi and Morii (2009)**: Improved the attack by removing the requirement for IEEE 802.11e QoS features.
- **Todo et al. (2012)**: Further reduced the time to recover keystream and the Michael MIC key.
- **Vanhoef and Piessens (2013)**: Demonstrated a fragmentation attack and introduced the Michael reset attack.

Our side-channel attacks differ from these in that they do not rely on Michael MIC failure reports, are faster to execute, and can attack both APs and clients.

## 4. Conclusion
Our systematic analysis of WPA-TKIP implementations revealed significant side-channel vulnerabilities. These attacks bypass existing countermeasures and allow adversaries to decrypt and inject network traffic within minutes. Given that nearly half of all encrypted networks still support WPA-TKIP, these findings underscore the need to deprecate this protocol and adopt more secure solutions such as WPA3.
