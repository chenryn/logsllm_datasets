Certainly! Here is a more structured and readable format for the log entry:

```
Log ID: 2575909
Node: node-162
Component: action
State: start
Timestamp: 1074178193
Flag: 1
Message: boot (command 1911)
```

This format clearly separates each piece of information, making it easier to read and understand.
