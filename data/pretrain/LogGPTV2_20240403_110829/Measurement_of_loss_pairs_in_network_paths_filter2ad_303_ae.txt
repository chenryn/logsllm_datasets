occurred during e1.
Figure 10(a) shows the eight forward paths to PL009. As
shown, while the forward paths from UB–UH went through
the peering of HKIX towards ASNET, the path from UA
actually went through the new service provider to ASNET.
As a result, the two RTT surges (point 2 above) were prob-
ably introduced by the HKIX network. Besides, we observe
that only ASNET and TANET were involved in all the eight
forward paths. Therefore, the loss pairs observed between
03:00 and 07:45 UTC (point 3) were probably introduced by
a congestion point near the destination. However, since only
UD–UH went through the temporary network to HKIX dur-
ing e1, the loss pairs observed between 07:45 and 11:00 UTC
from their paths (point 4) were likely due to the congestion
in this temporary network.
On the other hand, the tcptraceroute for the reverse paths
provide additional information to reveal the eﬀect of the
reverse-path networks on the observed ﬁrst packets’ and loss
pairs’ RTTs. Figure 10(b) shows the reverse paths to the
eight sources. As shown, only the reverse path to UD went
through the ASGCNET network (with at least three router
hops shorter). This observation suggests that the shorter
minRTT observed from the UD path (point 1) was probably
due to the shorter IP reverse route. While the other reverse
paths from PL009 went through ASNET, the new service
provider, and then HARNET to the sources, these paths
actually shared only three common router hops in ASNET.
Therefore, the RTT ﬂuctuation after 06:15 UTC observed
from most of the paths, except for the UD path (point 6),
was introduced by another common congestion point in the
ASNET network on the reverse paths.

The observations above indicate that the eight paths ex-
hibit relative stable RTTs and similar loss pairs’ patterns
between 02:35 and 06:15 UTC. To further characterize the
properties for the eight forward paths, we compute the dis-
tributions of the residual packets’ path queueing delays for
events P01x– (i.e., Θj−1) and P10xR00 (i.e., Θj) in Fig-
ures 11(a)–11(b). Figure 11(a) shows that the modes of the
path queueing delays for event P01x– were around 2 ms for
the eight sources; therefore, the sources probably shared the
same congestion point on their forward paths (which further
supports our above ﬁndings). Moreover, by studying the

distributions of the path queueing delays for event P10xR00
shown in Figure 11(b), we obtain additional ﬁngerprints for
the eight paths and can further classify the sources into three
groups: (i) UC and UD; (ii) UA, UF, and UG; and (iii) UB,
UE, and UH.
Figure 11(c) shows the ∆j−1,j distribution for each path
based on the mutual diﬀerences between the corresponding
residual packets’ path queueing delays for events P01x– and
P10xR00. As shown, the ∆j−1,j distributions for the three
groups are distinct from each other, meaning that they expe-
rienced diﬀerent H (h∗)’s conﬁgurations during the time pe-
riod. For group (i), the ﬁgure shows that the corresponding
link capacity was at least greater than 100 Mbits/s. How-
ever, we are unable to determine the exact value due to
the coarse packet timestamp resolution. For groups (ii) and
(iii), the estimated link capacities were at least 3 Mbits/s
and 1.5 Mbits/s, respectively. Overall, the loss-pair analysis
provides more comprehensive comparison of the eight paths
and their characteristics which would not be easily discov-
ered by considering only the loss frequencies (Figures 7(a)
and 8) or the packet-pair RTTs (Figure 9).
5.2.2 The loss episode e2
Figure 12 plots the time series of the ﬁrst packets’ RTTs
observed from the UF’s path to PL009 during e2. Similarly,
we superimpose the residual packets’ RTTs for events P01x–
and P10xR00 on the ﬁrst packets’ RTTs. Since this loss
episode was located after the transition to the new service
provider, it gives diﬀerent path characteristics as compared
with e1. The ﬁgure shows that the minRTT for the UF
path was around 65 ms, and most of the RTTs fell below
75 ms. We also observe similar RTT ranges for the other
paths, except for the UC path whose RTTs ranged between
101 ms and 119 ms. Since all the eight paths exhibit very
similar RTT time series patterns as in Figure 12, including
two RTT surges at 04:50 and 05:30 UTC, we omit the time
series for other paths.
Moreover, forward-path loss pairs were observed from the
eight paths between 03:00 and 07:45 UTC. It is interesting
to note that this time period is exactly the same as that in e1
when forward-path loss pairs also existed in all the paths,
although the loss pairs’ RTTs found in e2 mostly hit the
highest values. This observation suggests that the transition
event did not aﬀect the congestion point in the forward path.
Our tcptraceroute results for the forward paths obtained in
e2 also show that the forward paths still went through the
same hops in ASNET and TANET observed during e1.
98Figure 12: RTT time series for the path from UF to
PL009 during the loss episode e2.
We obtain the path queueing delays to further examine the
impact of the transition to the new service provider. Figure
13 plots the distributions of the path queueing delays for
events P01x– and P10xR00, and their diﬀerences obtained
from the eight paths between 02:35 and 06:15 UTC during
e2. Figure 13(a) shows that the modes of the path queueing
delays for event P01x– were still around 2 ms. Therefore, the
transition probably had no impact on the congestion point
encountered by the eight paths. However, Figures 13(b) and
13(c) show that the transition aﬀected the conﬁguration of
H (h∗) for the eight paths (comparing with Figures 11(b) and
11(c)), where the distributions for both ∆j−1,j and path
queueing delays for event P10xR00 are very similar among
the eight sources. As a result, the sources likely shared the
same hop at H (h∗) after the transition.
5.3 Loss-pair analysis of the paths to PL014
In this section, we apply the loss-pair analysis to the
eight sources’ reverse paths from PL014. Recall from Figure
7(d) that the reverse paths from PL014 exhibited signiﬁ-
cant packet loss during the measurement period. Figure 14
shows the heat-map time series for the frequency of event
P00xR01. Similarly, the grey areas indicate the periods with
no measurement data. We also note that the time series for
the event P00xR10 (not shown in the ﬁgure) shows a sim-
ilar pattern. Figure 14 shows that the frequency for each
path was less than 4%. The reverse paths to UD, UF, and
UG suﬀered a long-term loss episode for the entire measure-
ment period, and the paths to others encountered several
loss episodes before 13 March 2010.
5.3.1 The loss episode e3
We analyze a reverse-path loss episode (labeled as e3 in
Figure 14) between 00:00 and 23:59 UTC on 8 March 2010.
Figure 15 plots the RTT time series of the ﬁrst packets
and the residual packets’ RTTs for events P00xR01 and
P00xR10 obtained from the paths for UC and UF to PL014
during e3. Figure 15(a) shows an RTT inﬂation period be-
tween 03:00 and 18:00 UTC. Note that most of the loss pairs
were found within this RTT inﬂation period. Figure 15(b),
on the other hand, also shows an RTT inﬂation period, but
the loss pairs can be found throughout the measurement pe-
riod. For other paths, the RTT time series for UA, UB, UE,
and UH exhibit similar patterns as that for UC, whereas the
time series for UD and UG are similar to that for UF. There-
fore, we classify the eight sources into two groups: (i) UA,
UB, UC, UE, and UH; and (ii) UD, UF, and UG. Moreover,
we observe a minRTT of 50 ms for the UD path, and 35 ms
for the other paths.
To characterize the congestion node’s state encountered
by the two groups of paths, we plot the path queueing delays
