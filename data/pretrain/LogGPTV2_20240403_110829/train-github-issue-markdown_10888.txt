As part of the recent changes the Full Stack certificate I had previously
claimed was removed, but the corresponding waypoint was still marked as done,
and this waypoint was reused for the new Back End certificate. I have now
completed the additional API challenges, but when I click through the waypoint
again I don't get the Back End certificate added to my profile
(http://www.freecodecamp.com/george-stepanek).
