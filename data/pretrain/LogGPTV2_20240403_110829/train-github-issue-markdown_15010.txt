##### Description of the problem
The orthographic shadow camera is hard coded, thus it only works in very
limited circumstances. It seems like a simple typo, the input is called
'light' when it should probably be camera, and then a quick check to use the
default or the camera that is passed in. Right now the 'light' parameter
appears not to be used. I can probably make a pull request myself, but I
wanted to check if anyone is already working on shadows, so as to not
duplicate work.
LightShadow.call( this, new OrthographicCamera( - 5, 5, 5, - 5, 0.5, 500 ) );
