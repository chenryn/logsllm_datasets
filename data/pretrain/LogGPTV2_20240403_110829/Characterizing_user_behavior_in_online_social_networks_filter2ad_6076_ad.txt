Orkut as their primary social network and access MySpace
to keep in touch with friends that use only MySpace.
Fourth, the popular user activities in Hi5 were similar to
those of Orkut: the most frequent user activity involved
browsing friends’ updates through Proﬁle & Friends and
Photos. The next most popular user activity in both OSNs
was a form of message interaction among users: Scrapbook
in Orkut and Comments and Messages in Hi5. We expect
to see similar usage trends for other social networks that
possess similar service characteristics to Orkut.
4.3 Probability of activity over time
We next investigated whether there is any correlation be-
tween the occurrence of a particular activity and session du-
ration. To check for such a correlation, we categorized user
sessions into four non-overlapping classes based on their ses-
sion durations: (a) less than 1 minute, (b) 1 to 10 minutes,
(c) 10 to 20 minutes, and (d ) 20 minutes or longer. For ses-
sions belonging to each of these intervals, we examined the
average proportion of the total session duration that a user
spent on each activity.
Figure 5 shows the fraction of time spent on each activity
as a function of session duration. The results are shown in
two separate plots to more easily exhibit the trends for both
dominant and subdominant activities. We found two key
patterns. First, irrespective of session duration, users spent
the most time on Proﬁle & Friends and Scrapbook activi-
ties. In very short sessions (i.e., less than 1 minute), users
spent 90% of their time on these activities. However, even
for a long session (i.e., 20 minutes or longer), the two activ-
ities accounted for 75% of the total. Second, the remaining
categories of activities became more prevalent for longer ses-
sions. The fraction of time spent consuming media content
(i.e., Photos and Videos activities) increased by a factor of
2 when comparing sessions shorter than 1 minute to those
longer than 20 minutes. The probability of seeing Commu-
nity activity also increased with the session duration.
4.4 Transition from one activity to another
In the second step of modeling, we constructed a ﬁrst-
order Markov chain of user activity based on the sequence
of activities seen from all sessions. We added two abstract
states, initial and ﬁnal, which we appended to the sequence
of requests at the beginning and the end of the user sessions,
respectively.
Figure 6(a) shows the transition probability between all
pairs of activities. A color pixel at (x,y) represents the prob-
ability of transition from activity x in the horizontal axis to
activity y in the vertical axis. Activity IDs in the ﬁgure are
identical to the activity IDs in Table 2. We also visually
show the boundaries for categories. Darker pixels indicate
higher transition probability. For visual clarity, probabilities
below 0.01 are shown as zero probability in the ﬁgure.
When users log in to the social network aggregator site,
they are immediately exposed to a small selection of updates
from all social networks. Users can then click on any of
the displayed web objects or the logo of a social network
to further browse a given social network. These events are
shown as dark pixels on the ﬁrst column in Figure 6(a). For
example, x=“Start” and y=“browsing homepage” illustrates
the case when a user clicked on the logo of a social network
and the homepage of the social network was displayed. A
typical session started with one of the following activities:
browsing scrap, browsing proﬁle, and browsing homepage.
Once a user engaged in a particular activity, the user was
likely to repeat the same activity. This is shown by a strong
linear trend in y = x. For instance, after browsing one
photo, a user was likely to immediately browse other photos.
In total, 67% of the user activities were repeated.

same category (77%) than across categories (23%). This
means that users typically conduct a sequence of activities
that are conceptually related. For instance, a user is likely to
browse photos immediately after browsing the list of photo
albums, rather than after conducting a less related activity
like accessing applications.
We also notice that popular activities like browsing home-
page, browsing proﬁles, and browsing scraps display charac-
teristic horizontal stripes in the graph. This is because every
Orkut page embeds hyperlinks to a user’s homepage, proﬁle
page, and scrapbook page. This suggests that providing a
means for users to access a particular feature easily can mo-
tivate users to use the given feature frequently.
4.5 Transition from one category to another
Finally we examined the sequence of user activities at the
level of categories (Figure 6(b)). Again we added two syn-
thetic states, Initial and Final, at the beginning and the end
of each session. Nodes now represent categories and directed
edges represent the transition between two categories. Edges
with probability smaller than 4% were removed to reduce the
ﬁgure complexity. The sum of all outgoing probabilities (in-
cluding the omitted edges) for each state is 1.0. Compared
to Figure 6(a), user behaviors at the category level provide
a more holistic view of OSN usage.
We observe that most users initiated their sessions from
the Proﬁle & Friends, Scrapbook, or Photos category, as
mentioned earlier. We also observe that self loops are
present in almost all states. For example, one Communities
activity was followed by another Community activity with
a probability of 0.82. Similarly, Photos activities showed
high repetition with a probability of 0.86. Repetition also
occurred in Search (probability 0.71). Repetition in Scrap-
book was related to users replying to received scraps after
browsing them. In Orkut, users can directly reply to an ex-
isting (received) scrap from one’s own Scrapbook page. We
found that 65% of write scrap events (activity 3) immedi-
ately followed browsing scrap events (activity 2). Except for
self loops, Proﬁle & Friends was the most common preceding
state for most activities.
5. SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN ORKUT
One crucial aspect of OSNs is the wide range of features
that support communication between users. In this section,
we investigate how users interact with each other through
the various features OSNs provide.
5.1 Overview
Understanding social interactions has been of great inter-
est in various research ﬁelds like sociology, economy, political
science, and marketing. Until recently, obtaining large-scale
data was one of the key challenges in studying social in-
teractions. Nowadays, we get around this challenge by the
wealth of OSN data available on the Internet. A few stud-
ies have used publicly crawled OSN data (e.g., comments,
testimonials) to characterize social interactions [8,14,30,33].
Although these initial studies have identiﬁed several impor-
tant properties of social interaction, there are behaviors of
users that cannot be measured with datasets that contain
only visible activity.
One such activity is browsing, which, as demonstrated in
the previous section, is one of the most frequent activities
in OSNs.1 As opposed to “visible” interactions that are in-
ferred from crawled data like writing a scrap, browsing a
friend’s web content can be considered “silent” social inter-
action. Although visible and silent interactions serve diﬀer-
ent purposes, both are interesting for the understanding the
social interaction behaviors of users.
In this section we provide a complete view of user inter-
action in social networks, by considering both visible inter-
action and silent interaction. Our goal is two-fold: (a) We
would like to know what fraction of user interaction is silent,
compared to visible. If we consider visiting a friend’ proﬁle
or photo pages as social interaction among users, how much
increase would we observe in the number of friends a user
typically interacts with? We highlight the potential bias in
studies of user interactions using only visible data. (b) We
are interested in knowing the interaction patterns among
users along the social graph distance.
In particular, how
often do users visit their friends’ proﬁles or even traverse
multiple hops to visit the proﬁle of friend of a friend?
5.2 Interaction over social network distance
We only considered explicitly visiting another user’s page
to be silent user interaction. It is possible that a user can
silently “interact” with a friend by viewing the short list of
updates about that friend that are automatically shown on
the user’s own homepage. However, we do not count these
views as interaction, because we cannot be certain whether
a user noticed these updates.2 For example, a user may ﬁnd
a thumbnail of photo update from a friend at her homepage.
Only when the user clicks on the photo (thereby visiting the
friend’s photo page), do we then consider the event as a valid
social interaction with a 1-hop friend.
To gain a comprehensive understanding on the social be-
havior of a user, we needed an essential piece of information:
the list of friends of a given user. The clickstream dataset
does not include information about the list of friends. There-
fore, as described in Section 2.3, we gathered information
about the list of friends for all users in the workload trace
by crawling the Orkut website.
5.2.1 Webpage access patterns
To investigate the patterns of interaction among users,
we ﬁrst examined how often users visit their friends’ pages,
compared to visiting their own. Not all accesses in the trace
were related to interaction among users. Therefore, we fo-
cused on the following activities as a form of user interaction:
scrapbook, messages, testimonials, videos, photos, and pro-
ﬁle & friends. This list comprises activities from 2 to 26 in
Table 2. We excluded all activities related to search, com-
munities, and others in Table 2.
Figure 7 shows, for each category of user activity, the
fraction of times a user was accessing one’s own page (de-
noted self
in the ﬁgure), a page of an immediate friend
(denoted friend ), or a page of a non-immediate friend (de-
noted 2+hops). The result for Messages is omitted, because
users can only access their own Messages page. Unless a
user has explicitly restricted access, Orkut users can browse
1Most social networks do not log browsing events of users.
However, one exception is Orkut. In Orkut, the list of “re-
cent visitors” to every proﬁle page is shown. Users can also
turn this option oﬀ and hide their browsing patterns.
2User studies using eye tracking devices will be able to dis-
tinguish whether users noticed the exposed content or not.
58Figure 7: Webpage accesses along the social network distance
Figure 8: Interaction in writing
any other user’s pages containing scrapbook, testimonials,
video, photo, and proﬁle. However, the bar chart shows
that users mostly accessed pages of their own or their im-
mediate friends; 80% of all accesses remain within a 1-hop
neighborhood in the social network topology.
We examined each of the activity categories in detail.
Users most frequently accessed their own pages when it
comes to scrapbook and testimonials. Yet, users did visit
scrapbook and testimonial pages of their 1-hop friends and
read what messages are written about their friends. With a
small probability, users also visited beyond the 1-hop neigh-
borhood. In total, Orkut users accessed their friends’ pages
more frequently (59%)3 than their own pages. When vis-
iting friends’ pages, Orkut users not only interacted with
immediate friends, but also had signiﬁcant exposure to non-
immediate friends (22%=13/59).
Focusing on each category of interaction, Table 2 shows
that users accessed their own video pages as often as they
accessed their friends’ video pages. On the other hand, in
accessing photos, which is a popular activity in Orkut, users
were more likely to access their friends’ photo pages than
their own. Accessing proﬁle pages was well-divided among
one’s own, immediate friends, and non-immediate friends;
20% of the browsed proﬁles were 2 or more hops away.
Next we focused on visible interactions and examined
which friends users interacted with. We considered the fol-
lowing three visible activities: write scraps (activity 3), write
messages (activity 5), and write testimonials (activity 7), be-
cause for these activities we could determine the interaction
partner from the URL of the trace.
Figure 8 shows the division of the times when a user wrote
to oneself, a 1-hop friend, or a 2 or more hop away friend.
When using the scrapbook feature, users mostly interacted
with immediate friends. Self posts were rare (0.5%), but
could serve as a broadcast message to everyone who visits
the scrapbook.
Interestingly, 10% of scraps were sent to
users that are 2 or more hops away. On the other hand,
users did not interact much with immediate friends through
Messages.
Instead, we observed frequent interaction with
non-immediate friends through Messages (76%). Testimo-
nials were only sent to immediate friends, as written in the
Orkut policy. We discuss the implications of these ﬁndings
in the following section.
3This probability is computed as the count of activities at
1-hop divided by the total occurrences of all activities.
5.2.2 What leads users to visit other people’s pages?
Having studied the frequency at which users access their
friends’ pages, we now take a closer look at how a user nav-
igates from one friend’s page to another. Particularly, we
are interested in understanding what activities lead users to
visit a page of a friend or a non-friend. We performed the fol-
lowing analysis. Each time a user visited a page of a friend,
we examined which preceding page the user was at: one’s
own page, an immediate friend’s page, or a non-immediate
friend’s page? Table 4 shows the fraction of preceding loca-
tions for every ﬁrst access to a friend’s page in each session.
In addition to the navigation statistics, Table 4 also shows
the list of top activities that preceded the navigation event.
The majority of accesses (68%) to an immediate friend’s
webpage originated from browsing one’s own webpage (the
ﬁrst row of Table 2). The remaining accesses occurred when
the user was navigating the social network; accesses to an
immediate friend’s webpage were followed by browsing of
another immediate friend’s webpage (25%) or browsing of
a non-immediate friend’s webpage (7%). When it comes
to visiting a non-immediate friend’s webpage (the second
row of Table 2), the preceding location of the user was well
distributed across 0-hop, 1-hop, and 2 or more hops.
Interestingly, the most popular activity that leads a user
to an immediate or non-immediate friend’s webpage is
browsing one’s own homepage. As described in Section 4.1, a
user’s homepage contains a short list of updates from friends
as well as a list of the subset of friends who recently logged
in. Such updates can contain links to non-immediate friends
when they interacted with mutual friends through photo
comments, testimonials, or applications. Therefore, updates
from friends can also drive users to visit the webpage of a
friend of a friend.
Another interesting observation we make is the high frac-
tion of accesses that originated from an immediate friend’s
webpage, which accounted for 25% of the accesses to an-
other immediate friend’s webpage and 30% of the accesses
to a non-immediate friend’s webpage (the third column of
Table 2). This reinforces the previous ﬁndings that users in
social networks ﬁnd new content and contacts through their
1-hop friends [4, 5, 28]. Browsing an immediate friend’s pro-
ﬁle was the most common gateway that led users from one
friend to another.
Lastly, we note that browsing scraps (activity 2) appears
in the top three activities in all the rows of Table 4. This
may mean that Orkut users are keen on reading other users’
scrapbook content and also are curious about checking out
new contacts that they encounter through such activity.
