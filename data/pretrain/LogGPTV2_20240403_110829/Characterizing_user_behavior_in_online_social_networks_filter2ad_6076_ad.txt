### Orkut and MySpace Usage Patterns

Some users primarily used Orkut as their main social network while also accessing MySpace to stay connected with friends who exclusively used Myspace. The most popular activities on Hi5 were similar to those on Orkut, with the most frequent activity being browsing friends' updates through "Profile & Friends" and "Photos." The next most popular activity in both networks involved message interactions: "Scrapbook" in Orkut and "Comments and Messages" in Hi5. We anticipate that other social networks with similar features will exhibit comparable usage trends.

### 4.3 Probability of Activity Over Time

We then explored whether there is a correlation between specific activities and session duration. To do this, we categorized user sessions into four non-overlapping classes based on their session durations: (a) less than 1 minute, (b) 1 to 10 minutes, (c) 10 to 20 minutes, and (d) 20 minutes or longer. For each session duration class, we examined the average proportion of time spent on each activity.

**Figure 5** shows the fraction of time spent on each activity as a function of session duration. The results are presented in two separate plots to better illustrate the trends for both dominant and subdominant activities. Two key patterns emerged:

1. **Dominant Activities**: Regardless of session duration, users spent the most time on "Profile & Friends" and "Scrapbook" activities. In very short sessions (less than 1 minute), users spent 90% of their time on these activities. Even in long sessions (20 minutes or longer), these two activities accounted for 75% of the total session time.
2. **Subdominant Activities**: The remaining activities, such as "Photos" and "Videos," became more prevalent in longer sessions. The fraction of time spent consuming media content increased by a factor of 2 when comparing sessions shorter than 1 minute to those longer than 20 minutes. The likelihood of engaging in "Community" activities also increased with session duration.

### 4.4 Transition from One Activity to Another

In the second step of our modeling, we constructed a first-order Markov chain of user activity based on the sequence of activities observed in all sessions. We added two abstract states, "Initial" and "Final," which we appended to the beginning and end of the user sessions, respectively.

**Figure 6(a)** shows the transition probability between all pairs of activities. A color pixel at (x, y) represents the probability of transitioning from activity x (horizontal axis) to activity y (vertical axis). Darker pixels indicate higher transition probabilities. For visual clarity, probabilities below 0.01 are shown as zero.

When users log in to the social network aggregator site, they are immediately exposed to a small selection of updates from all social networks. Users can click on any displayed web object or the logo of a social network to further browse. These events are shown as dark pixels in the first column of **Figure 6(a)**. For example, if a user clicks on a social network logo, the homepage of that network is displayed.

A typical session started with one of the following activities: browsing scrap, browsing profile, or browsing the homepage. Once engaged in a particular activity, users were likely to repeat the same activity, as indicated by a strong linear trend in y = x. For instance, after browsing one photo, a user was likely to browse other photos. In total, 67% of user activities were repeated.

### 4.5 Transition from One Category to Another

Finally, we examined the sequence of user activities at the category level, as shown in **Figure 6(b)**. We again added two synthetic states, "Initial" and "Final," at the beginning and end of each session. Nodes now represent categories, and directed edges represent transitions between categories. Edges with probabilities smaller than 4% were removed to reduce complexity. The sum of all outgoing probabilities (including omitted edges) for each state is 1.0.

Most users initiated their sessions from the "Profile & Friends," "Scrapbook," or "Photos" category. Self-loops were present in almost all states, indicating high repetition. For example, "Communities" activities were followed by another "Communities" activity with a probability of 0.82. Similarly, "Photos" activities showed high repetition with a probability of 0.86. Repetition also occurred in "Search" (probability 0.71) and "Scrapbook" (related to replying to received scraps).

### 5. Social Interactions in Orkut

One crucial aspect of online social networks (OSNs) is the wide range of features that support communication between users. This section investigates how users interact with each other through the various features provided by OSNs.

#### 5.1 Overview

Understanding social interactions has been a significant interest in fields like sociology, economics, political science, and marketing. Until recently, obtaining large-scale data was a key challenge. However, the availability of OSN data on the Internet has mitigated this issue. Some studies have used publicly crawled OSN data to characterize social interactions, but these datasets often miss silent interactions, such as browsing, which is one of the most frequent activities in OSNs.

In this section, we provide a complete view of user interaction in social networks by considering both visible and silent interactions. Our goals are:

1. **Silent vs. Visible Interaction**: Determine the fraction of user interaction that is silent compared to visible. If visiting a friend's profile or photo pages is considered social interaction, how much does it increase the number of friends a user typically interacts with? We highlight potential biases in studies using only visible data.
2. **Interaction Patterns**: Investigate the interaction patterns among users along the social graph distance. How often do users visit their friends' profiles or traverse multiple hops to visit the profile of a friend of a friend?

#### 5.2 Interaction over Social Network Distance

We considered explicitly visiting another user's page as silent user interaction. It is possible for a user to silently "interact" with a friend by viewing updates on their own homepage, but we do not count these views as interaction because we cannot be certain the user noticed them. For example, a user may see a thumbnail of a photo update from a friend on their homepage. Only when the user clicks on the photo (visiting the friend's photo page) do we consider it a valid social interaction with a 1-hop friend.

To understand user behavior, we needed the list of friends for each user, which was not included in the clickstream dataset. Therefore, we gathered this information by crawling the Orkut website.

##### 5.2.1 Webpage Access Patterns

To investigate interaction patterns, we examined how often users visit their friends' pages compared to their own. We focused on activities such as scrapbook, messages, testimonials, videos, photos, and profile & friends. Figure 7 shows, for each category of user activity, the fraction of times a user accessed their own page, an immediate friend's page, or a non-immediate friend's page.

Users mostly accessed pages of their own or their immediate friends; 80% of all accesses remained within a 1-hop neighborhood. When visiting friends' pages, users not only interacted with immediate friends but also had significant exposure to non-immediate friends (22%).

Focusing on visible interactions, we examined which friends users interacted with. We considered writing scraps, messages, and testimonials. Figure 8 shows the division of times when a user wrote to themselves, a 1-hop friend, or a 2 or more hop away friend. Most scrapbook interactions were with immediate friends, with 10% sent to users 2 or more hops away. Messages were frequently sent to non-immediate friends (76%). Testimonials were only sent to immediate friends, as per Orkut policy.

##### 5.2.2 What Leads Users to Visit Other Peopleâ€™s Pages?

Having studied the frequency of accessing friends' pages, we now look at how users navigate from one friend's page to another. Table 4 shows the fraction of preceding locations for every first access to a friend's page in each session.

The majority of accesses (68%) to an immediate friend's webpage originated from browsing one's own webpage. The remaining accesses occurred when the user was navigating the social network. Browsing an immediate friend's profile was the most common gateway leading users from one friend to another. Browsing scraps appeared in the top three activities in all rows of Table 4, indicating that users are keen on reading scrapbook content and curious about new contacts encountered through such activity.
