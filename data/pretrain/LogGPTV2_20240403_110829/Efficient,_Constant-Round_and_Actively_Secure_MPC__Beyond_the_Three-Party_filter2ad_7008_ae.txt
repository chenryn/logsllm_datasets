Table 4: Execution times [ms]: SHA-256 circuit, low latency
(ONT), which measures the wall clock time taken to execute the online (input-speciﬁc) phase; total
protocol time (TPT) which measures the wall clock time to execute the entire protocol; and the
CPU time (CPUT), which measures the total time spent on computing across all cores (note that
this time can sometimes be larger than TPT when there is great degree of parallelization in the
implementation). The results are presented and compared in Tables 3 and 4.
As can be seen from the table, for the AES circuit, our 5PC-M is only 69% slower than BLO
(which is only passively secure) in terms of TPT, with CPUT being even lesser in our case (in-
dicating that compute time can be reduced in our protocol through greater parallelization which
our protocol accommodates). Our 5PC-SH takes about the same time as BLO (due to the very
fast network, the savings in communication is not visible and the BLO protocol takes advantage of
parallelization in compute even though the CPU time in BLO is 78% more than in our protocol).
For the SHA-256 circuit, our 5PC-M is only about 2.3 times slower than BLO, with roughly same
CPU times, and our 5PC-SH is about 1.5 times slower than BLO, with about 52% of the CPU
time, once again due to the parallelization optimizations performed in BLO.

Central, West, North Central, South Central US regions with an average round-trip time of the

slowest link (East to West) being 92.8 milliseconds (maximum time of 974.6 milliseconds). The
average bandwidth, again of the slowest link, as measured by the Iperf testing tool was 292 Mbps.
The results are presented and compared in Tables 5 and 6. As communication becomes critical
in medium-latency networks, our protocols perform signiﬁcantly better than existing protocols in
this domain. As can be seen from the table, for the AES circuit, our 5PC-M is actually 1.83 times
faster than BLO (which, again, is only passively secure) in terms of total execution time; this is due
to our better overall communication complexity as this factor dominates even in medium-latency
networks . Our 5PC-SH is 2.6 times faster than BLO. For the SHA-256 circuit, our 5PC-M is once
again 1.77 times faster than BLO, while our 5PC-SH is 3.1 times faster than BLO.
High-latency network. For the last experiment, 3 garblers were located in the Western US
region and the remaining garbler and the evaluator located in North Europe. with an average
round-trip time of the slowest link (West US to North Europe) being 142.6 milliseconds (maximum
time of 153.2 milliseconds). The average bandwidth, again of the slowest link, as measured by the
Iperf testing tool was 146 Mbps. The results3 are presented and compared in Tables 7 and 8. For
3Network time is the huge dominating factor in this case. Since we measure average time of garblers, when one of
the links between a garbler and evaluator is slow, the time of the evaluator is aﬀected more than the average time of
