I have been using the `dnspython` module in Python. However, I am encountering issues when trying to use it on a new Linux installation. Despite attempting to clean up and reinstall, the module does not seem to be loading correctly.

Here are the steps I have taken and the corresponding output:

```bash
$ python --version
Python 2.7.3

$ sudo pip install dnspython
Downloading/unpacking dnspython
  Downloading dnspython-1.11.1.zip (220Kb): 220Kb downloaded
  Running setup.py egg_info for package dnspython

Installing collected packages: dnspython
  Running setup.py install for dnspython

Successfully installed dnspython
Cleaning up...

$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import dns
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named dns
```

Additionally, here is the output for the Python and pip version commands:

```bash
$ which python
/usr/bin/python

$ python --version
Python 2.7.3

$ pip --version
pip 1.0 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
```

I have also tried installing the package using the following command, but the issue persists:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython
```

I have a firewall installed on the new machine, and although I am not sure if it should affect the import, I have tried disabling it, and the problem still remains.

Thank you very much for your help.
