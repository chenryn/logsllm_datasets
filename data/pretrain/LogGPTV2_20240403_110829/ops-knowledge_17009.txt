User: What is Network Load Balancing? Please list commonly used load balancing algorithms and tools.
Assistant: Network load balancing refers to the technical means of distributing network load to multiple servers through network devices (such as switches, routers, load balancers, etc.) to achieve load balancing. Commonly used load balancing algorithms are: 1. Round Robin: Assign requests to different servers in sequence. 2. Weight Round Robin: Set different weight values according to the processing capabilities of different servers, and assign requests to each server. 3. Least Connection algorithm (Least Connection): assign the request to the server with the least number of current connections. 4. IP Hash Algorithm (IP Hash): Hash calculation is performed according to the IP address of the client, and the request is allocated to the corresponding server. Commonly used load balancing tools are: 1. Nginx: A common web server and reverse proxy server that supports multiple load balancing algorithms. 2. HAProxy: A high-performance TCP/HTTP load balancing software that supports multiple load balancing algorithms. 3. F5 BIG-IP: A hardware device that integrates functions such as load balancing, network firewall, and application delivery. 4. Apache mod_proxy_balancer: A module of Apache that can implement load balancing and reverse proxy functions.
