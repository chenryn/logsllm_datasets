User: I need to transfer data via pyzmq through two computers connected by an ethernet cable. I have already set up a script that runs on the same computer correctly, but I need to find the tcp address of the other computer in order to communicate. They both run Ubuntu 14.04. One of them should be a server processing requests while the other sends requests. How do I transfer data over tcp through ethernet? I simply need a way to find the address.
EDIT: (Clarification) I am running a behavioural study. I have a program called OpenSesame which runs in python and takes python scripts. I need a participant to be able to sit at a computer and be able to ask another person questions (specifically for help in a task). I need a server (using pyzmq preferably) to be connected by ethernet and communicate with that computer. It wrote a script. It works on the same computer, but not over ethernet. I need to find the address
Assistant: Maybe you could periodically send datagram message containing peer's ip address (or some other useful information) to broadcast address, to allow other peers to discover it. And after peer's address is dicovered you can estabish connection via ZeroMQ or other kind... connection. :)
