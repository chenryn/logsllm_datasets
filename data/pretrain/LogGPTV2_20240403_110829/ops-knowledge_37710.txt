User: My Python 3.5.2 output in the terminal (on a mac) is limited to a width of ca. 80px, even if I increase the size of the terminal window.
This narrow width causes a bunch of line breaks when outputting long arrays which is really a hassle. How do I tell python to use the full command line window width?
For the record, i am not seeing this problem in any other program, for instance my c++ output looks just fine.
Assistant: I have the same problem while using pandas. So if this is what you are trying to solve, I fixed mine by doing 
pd.set_option('display.width', pd.util.terminal.get_terminal_size()[0])
