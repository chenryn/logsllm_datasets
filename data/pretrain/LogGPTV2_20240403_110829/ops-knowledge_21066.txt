User: I'm trying to install Scrapy, but got this error during installing: build\temp.win-amd64-2.7\Release_openssl.c(429) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'openssl/opensslv.h': No such file or directory
I've checked that the file "opensslv.h" is in here "C:\OpenSSL-Win64\include\openssl". And I've also included this "C:\OpenSSL-Win64\include" in the Path, system variables. 
Stuck on this for hours, can someone please help out? Thanks.
The same issue was found for the "cryptography-1.5.2" package
Assistant: Copy "openssl" folder from C:\OpenSSL-Win32\include\ to C:\Pyhton27\include\
and copy all libs from C:\OpenSSL-win32\lib to C:\Python27\Libs\
