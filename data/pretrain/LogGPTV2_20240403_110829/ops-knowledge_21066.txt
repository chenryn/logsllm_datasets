I am trying to install Scrapy, but I encountered the following error during the installation process:

```
build\temp.win-amd64-2.7\Release_openssl.c(429) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'openssl/opensslv.h': No such file or directory
```

I have verified that the `opensslv.h` file is located at `C:\OpenSSL-Win64\include\openssl`. Additionally, I have added `C:\OpenSSL-Win64\include` to the system's `Path` environment variable.

Despite these steps, I am still unable to resolve the issue. I have been stuck on this for hours. Can someone please help me out? Thank you.

I also encountered the same problem when installing the `cryptography-1.5.2` package.

**Suggested Solution:**

1. Copy the `openssl` folder from `C:\OpenSSL-Win32\include\` to `C:\Python27\include\`.
2. Copy all the `.lib` files from `C:\OpenSSL-Win32\lib\` to `C:\Python27\Libs\`.

This should make your request clearer and more professional.
