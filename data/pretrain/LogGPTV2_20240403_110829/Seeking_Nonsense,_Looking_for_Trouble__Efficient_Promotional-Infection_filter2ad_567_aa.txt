Abstract—Promotional
infection is an attack in which the
adversary exploits a website’s weakness to inject illicit advertising
content. Detection of such an infection is challenging due to
its similarity to legitimate advertising activities. An interesting
observation we make in our research is that such an attack
almost always incurs a great semantic gap between the infected
domain (e.g., a university site) and the content it promotes
(e.g., selling cheap viagra). Exploiting this gap, we developed a
semantic-based technique, called Semantic Inconsistency Search
(SEISE), for efﬁcient and accurate detection of the promotional
injections on sponsored top-level domains (sTLD) with explicit
semantic meanings. Our approach utilizes Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to identify the bad terms (those related to
illicit activities like fake drug selling, etc.) most irrelevant to an
sTLD’s semantics. These terms, which we call irrelevant bad terms
(IBTs), are used to query search engines under the sTLD for
suspicious domains. Through a semantic analysis on the results
page returned by the search engines, SEISE is able to detect
those truly infected sites and automatically collect new IBTs
from the titles/URLs/snippets of their search result items for
ﬁnding new infections. Running on 403 sTLDs with an initial 30
seed IBTs, SEISE analyzed 100K fully qualiﬁed domain names
(FQDN), and along the way automatically gathered nearly 600
IBTs. In the end, our approach detected 11K infected FQDN
with a false detection rate of 1.5% and over 90% coverage.
Our study shows that by effective detection of infected sTLDs,
the bar to promotion infections can be substantially raised,
since other non-sTLD vulnerable domains typically have much
lower Alexa ranks and are therefore much less attractive for
underground advertising. Our ﬁndings further bring to light the
stunning impacts of such promotional attacks, which compromise
FQDNs under 3% of .edu, .gov domains and over one thousand
gov.cn domains, including those of leading universities such as
stanford.edu, mit.edu, princeton.edu, havard.edu and government
institutes such as nsf.gov and nih.gov. We further demonstrate
the potential to extend our current technique to protect generic
domains such as .com and .org.
I. INTRODUCTION
Imagine that you google the following search term: site:
stanford.edu pharmacy. Figure 1 shows what we got on
October 9, 2015. Under the domain of Stanford University
are advertisements (ad) for selling cheap viagra! Using various
search terms, we also found the ads for prescription-free
viagra and other drugs under nidcr.nih.gov (National Institute
of Dental and Craniofacial Research), counterfeit
luxury
handbag under dap.dau.mil (Defense Acquisition Portal), and
replica Rolex under nv.gov, the domain of the Nevada state
government. Clearly, all those FQDNs have been unauthorizedly
changed for promoting counterfeit or illicit products. This type
of attacks (exploiting a legitimate domain for underground
advertising) is called promotional infection in our research.
Promotional infection is an attack exploiting the weakness
of a website to promote content. It has been used to serve
various malicious online activities (e.g., black-hat search engine
optimization (SEO), site defacement, fake antivirus (AV)
promotion, Phishing) through various exploit channels (e.g.,
SQL injection, URL redirection attack and blog/forum Spam).
Unlike the attacks hiding malicious payloads (e.g., malware)
from the search engine crawler, such as a drive-by download
campaign, the promotional attacks never shy away from search
engines. Instead, their purpose sometimes is to leverage the
compromised domain’s reputation to boost the rank of the
promoted content (either what is directly displayed under the
domain or the doorway page pointed by the domain) in the
search results returned to the user when content-related terms
are included in her query. Such infections can inﬂict signiﬁcant
harm on the compromised websites through loss in reputation,
search engine penalty, trafﬁc hijacking and may even have legal
ramiﬁcations. They are also pervasive: as an example, a study
shows that over 80% doorway pages involved in black-hat SEO
are from injected domains [28].
Catching promotional infections: challenges. Even with the
prevalence of the promotional infections, they are surprisingly
elusive and difﬁcult to catch. Those attacks often do not
cause automatic download of malware and therefore may not
be detected by virus scanners like VirusTotal and Microsoft
Forefront. Even the content injected into a compromised
website can appear perfectly normal, no difference from the
legitimate ads promoting similar products (e.g., drugs, red
wine, etc.), ideological and religious messages (e.g., cult theory
promotion) and others, unless its semantics has been carefully
examined under the context of the compromised site (e.g.,

selling red wine is unusual on a government’s website). So
far, detection of the promotional infections mostly relies on
the community effort, based upon the discoveries made by
human visitors (e.g., PhishTank [5]) or the integrity checks that
a compromised website’s owner performs. Although attempts
have been made to detect such attacks automatically, e.g.,
through a long term monitoring of changes in a website’s
DOM structure to identify anomalies [16] or through computer
vision techniques to recognize a web page’s visual change [17],
existing approaches are often inefﬁcient (requiring long term
monitoring or analyzing the website’s visual effects) and less
effective, due to the complexity of the infections, which, for
example, can introduce a redirection URL indistinguishable
from a legitimate link or make injected content only visible to
the search engine.
Semantic inconsistency search. As mentioned earlier, fun-
damentally, promotional infections can only be captured by
analyzing the semantic meaning of web content and the
context in which they appear. To meet the demand for a large-
scale online scan, such a semantic analysis should also be
fully automated and highly efﬁcient. Techniques of this type,
however, have never been studied before, possibly due to the
concern that a semantic-based approach tends to be complicated
and less accurate. In this paper, we report a design that makes a
big step forward on this direction, demonstrating it completely
possible to incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques into a lightweight security analysis for efﬁcient and
accurate detection of promotional infections. A key observation
here is that for the attacks in Figure 1, inappropriate content
shows up in the domains with speciﬁc meanings: no one expects
that a .gov or .edu site promotes prohibited drugs, counterfeit
luxury handbags, replica watches, etc. Such inconsistency can
be immediately identiﬁed and located from the itemized search
result on a returned search result page, which includes the
title, URL and snippet for each result (as marked out in
Figure 1). This approach, which detects a compromised domain
(e.g., stanford.edu) based upon the inconsistency between the
domain’s semantics and the content of its result snippet reported
by a search engine with regard to some search terms, is
called semantic inconsistency search or simply SEISE. Our
current design of SEISE focuses on sponsored top-level domain
(sTLD) like .gov, .edu, .mil, etc., that has a sponsor (e.g., US
General Service Administration, EDUCAUSE, DoD Network
Information Center), represents a narrow community and carries
designated semantics (Section III-A). Later we show that the
technique has the potential to be extended to generic TLD
(gTLD, see Section V-B).
SEISE is designed to search for a set of strategically selected
irrelevant terms under an sTLD (e.g., .edu) to ﬁnd out the
suspicious FQDNs (e.g., stanford.edu) associated with the
terms, and then further search under the domains and inspect the
snippets of the results before ﬂagging them as compromised.
To make this approach work, a few technical issues need to be
addressed: (1) how to identify semantic inconsistency between
injected pages and the main content of a domain; (2) how to
control the false positives caused by the legitimate content
including the terms, e.g., a health center sites on Stanford
University (containing the irrelevant term “pharmacy”); (3)
how to gather the search terms related to diverse promotional
content. For the ﬁrst issue, our approach starts with a small
set of manually selected terms popular in illicit activities (e.g.,
gambling, drug and adult) and runs a word embedding based
tool to calculate the semantic distance between these terms and
a set of keywords extracted from the sTLD’s search content,
which describe the sTLD’s semantics. Those most irrelevant
are utilized for detection (Section III-B). To suppress false
positives, our approach leverages the observation that similar
promotional content always appear on many different pages
under a compromised domain for the purpose of improving
the rank of the attack website pointed to by the content. As a
result, a search of the irrelevant term under the domain will
yield a result page on which many highly frequent terms (such
as “no prescription”, “low price” in the promotional content)
turn out to rarely occur across the generic content under the
same domain (e.g., stanford.edu). This is very different from
the situation, for example, when a research article mentions
viagra, since the article will not be scattered across many pages
under the site and tends to contain the terms also showing
up in the generic content under the Stanford domain, such as
“study”, “ﬁnding”, etc (Section III-B). Finally, using the terms
extracted from the result snippets of the sites detected, SEISE
further automatically expands the list of the search terms for
ﬁnding other attacks (Section III-C).
We implemented SEISE and evaluated its efﬁcacy in our
research (Section IV). Using 30 seed terms and 403 sTLDs
(across 141 countries and 89 languages), our system automati-
cally analyzed 100K FQDNs and along the way, expanded the
keyword list to 597 terms. In the end, it reported 11K infected
FQDNs, which have been conﬁrmed to be compromised1
through random sampling and manual validation. With its
low false detection rate (1.5%), SEISE also achieved over 90%
detection rate. Moving beyond sTLD, we further explore the
1Note that in line with the prior research [22], the term “compromise” here
refers to not only direct intrusion of a web domain, which was found to
be the most common cases in our research (80%, see Section VI), but also
posting of illicit advertising content onto the domain through exploiting its
weak (or lack of) input sanitization: e.g., blog/forum Spam and link Spam
(using exposed server-side scripts to dynamically generate promotion pages
under the legitimate domain).

potential extension of the technique to gTLDs such as .com
(Section V-B). A preliminary design analyzes .com domains
using their site tag labeled by SimilarSites [8], which is found
to be pretty effective: achieving a false detection rate (FDR) of
9% when long keywords gathered from compromised sTLDs
are used.
Our ﬁndings. Looking into the promotional infections detected
by SEISE, we were surprised by what we found: for example,
about 3% (175) of .gov domains and 3% (246) of .edu
domains are injected; also around 2% of the 62,667 Chinese
government domains (.gov.cn) are contaminated with ads,
defacement content, Phishing, etc. Of particular interest is
a huge gambling campaign we discovered (Section V-C),
which covers about 800 sTLDs and 3000 gTLDs across
12 countries and regions (US, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Singapore and others). Among the victims are 20 US academia
institutes such as nyu.edu, ucsd.edu, 5 government agencies like
va.gov, makinghomeaffordable.gov, together with 188 Chinese
universities and 510 Chinese government agencies. We even
recovered the attack toolkit used in the campaign, which
supports automatic site vulnerability scan, shell acquisition,
SEO page generation, etc. Also under California government’s
domain ca.gov, over one thousand promotion pages were
found, all pointing to the same online casino site. Another
campaign involves 102 US universities (mit.edu, princeton.edu,
stanford.edu, etc.), advertising “buy cheap essay”. The scope of
these attacks go beyond commercial advertising: we found that
12 Chinese government and university sites were vandalized
with the content for promoting Falun Gong. Given the large
number of compromised sites discovered, we ﬁrst reported
the most high-impact ﬁndings to related parties (particularly
universities and government agencies) and will continue to do
so (Section VI).
Further, our measurement study shows that some sTLDs such
as .edu, .edu.cn and .gov.cn are less protected than the .com
domains with similar Alexa ranks, and therefore become soft
targets for promotional infections (Section V-B). By effectively
detecting the attacks on these sTLDs, SEISE raises the bar for
the adversary, who has to resort to less guarded gTLDs, which
typically have much lower Alexa ranks, making the attacks,
SEO in particular, less effective.
Contributions. The contributions of the paper are outlined as
follows:
• Efﬁcient semantics-based detection of promotional infections.
We developed a novel technique that exploits the semantic
gap between domains (sTLDs in particular) and unauthorized
content they host to detect the compromised websites that serve
underground advertising. Our technique is highly effective,
incurring low false positives and negatives. Also importantly,
it is simple and efﬁcient: often a compromised domain can
be detected by querying Google no more than 3 times. This
indicates that the technique can be easily scaled, with the help
of search providers.
• Measurement study and new ﬁndings. We performed a
large-scale measurement study on promotional infections, the
ﬁrst of this kind. Our research brings to light several high-
impact, ongoing underground promotion campaigns, affecting
leading educational institutions and government agencies, and
the unique techniques the perpetrator employs. Further we
demonstrate the impacts of our innovation, which signiﬁcantly
raises the bar to promotional infections and can potentially be
extended to protect generic domains.

II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we lay out the background information of
our research, including the promotional infection, sTLD, NLP
and the assumptions we made.
Promotional infection. As mentioned earlier, promotion in-
fection is caused by exploiting the weakness of a website to
advertise some content. A typical form of such an attack is
black-hat SEO, a technique that improves the rank of certain
content on the results page by taking advantage of the way
search engines work, regardless of the guidelines they provide.
Such activities can happen on a dedicated host, for example,
through stufﬁng the pages with the popular search terms that
may not be related to the advertised content, for the purpose
of enhancing the chance for the user to ﬁnd the pages. In
other cases, the perpetrator compromises a high-rank website
to post an ad pointing to the site hosting promoted content,
in an attempt to utilize the compromised site’s reputation to
make the content more visible to the user. This can also be
done when the site does not check the content uploaded there,
such as visitors’ comments, which causes its display of blog or
forum Spam. Such SEO approaches, the direct compromise and
the uploading of Spam ads, are considered to be promotional
