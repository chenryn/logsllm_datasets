User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I display and log PHP errors on IIS7.5? I running PHP 5.4.5 on an IIS 7.5 Server (under Win7 64) and i have problems making PHP errors visible.
At the moment whenever i have a PHP error the server sends back a 500 error with the message "The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred."

I use phpmanager to configure php. The php Ini is correct with errorlogging E_ALL and display_errors enabled (error is writen to log also).
I already set the errorMode to Detailed from DetailedLocalOnly and removed all errorpages as well. But it is stil the same Error 500...
PS: I read already all posting on serverfault and stackoverflow.

Assistant: Take a look here: How can I display and log PHP errors on IIS7? . You will need to edit http configuration so it allows displaying of errors to remote users.
