### How to Display and Log PHP Errors on IIS 7.5

I am currently running PHP 5.4.5 on an IIS 7.5 server (under Windows 7 64-bit) and I am experiencing issues with making PHP errors visible. Whenever a PHP error occurs, the server returns a 500 Internal Server Error with the message: "The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred."

#### Configuration Details
- **PHP Manager**: Used to configure PHP.
- **php.ini**:
  - `error_reporting = E_ALL`
  - `display_errors = On`
  - `log_errors = On` (Errors are being written to the log file)

#### Steps Taken
1. Set the `errorMode` to `Detailed` from `DetailedLocalOnly`.
2. Removed all custom error pages.

Despite these changes, the issue persists, and I still receive a 500 Internal Server Error.

#### Additional Information
- I have reviewed related posts on Server Fault and Stack Overflow.

### Solution
To resolve this issue, you need to configure the IIS settings to allow the display of errors to remote users. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Open IIS Manager**:
   - Go to `Start` > `Administrative Tools` > `Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager`.

2. **Select Your Website**:
   - In the left-hand Connections pane, expand your server node and select the website where you want to display PHP errors.

3. **Configure Detailed Errors**:
   - In the main window, double-click on `Error Pages`.
   - Click on `Edit Feature Settings` in the Actions pane on the right.
   - Select `Detailed errors` and click `OK`.

4. **Modify Web.config**:
   - Open the `web.config` file for your website.
   - Add or modify the following configuration to ensure that detailed errors are shown to remote users:
     ```xml
     <configuration>
       <system.webServer>
         <httpErrors errorMode="Detailed" />
       </system.webServer>
     </configuration>
     ```

5. **Restart IIS**:
   - After making these changes, restart IIS to apply the new settings. You can do this by running the following command in the Command Prompt:
     ```sh
     iisreset
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to see detailed PHP error messages in your browser when an error occurs, and the errors will also be logged as configured in your `php.ini` file.

If the problem still persists, please provide any additional error logs or messages for further troubleshooting.
