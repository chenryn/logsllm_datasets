attacker’s capabilities of assessing the future, we assume the
attacker to stop at the ideal time w.r.t. his estimate of Pwin,
subject to his energy allocation strategy and a given attack
sequence.
Single-Power Attacker (SPA) This is an attacker that sends
all pulses at the same transmission power.
Multi-Power Attacker (MPA) This model captures a more
powerful attacker that can transmit at varying power levels.
Having a limited number of chances to guess a bit correctly,
the aim of this attacker is to compensate for any wrong
interference as soon as possible. Any pulse guessed wrong
will cause this attacker to double his power level for the next
transmission. This way, each correctly guessed pulse results in
a correct bit. Consequently, each correct guess improves Pwin
and, if things don’t go so well, chances of still guessing the
bit remain nonzero as long one pulse for each bit remains (i.e.,
as long as possible).
1) Attack Simulation and Results: Both attackers were
simulated in MATLAB. For a given (legitimate) polarity
sequence, both models result in a deterministic attack se-
quence. This allowed obtaining attack success probabilities by
simulating attacks on randomly sampled polarity sequences
and reorderings efﬁciently. For a sampled polarity sequence,
Pwin was calculated by randomly sampling pulse reorderings.
As explained previously, the peak Pwin over the entire attack
sequence was chosen to characterize the attacker’s chances of
winning for this given sequence (Optimal Attack Termination).
Figure 11 shows the attack success probabilities for different
conﬁgurations of NB and NP . The results show that
the
security offered by UWB-PR increases for higher numbers
of bits grouped together for reordering. For the conﬁguration
geared towards the long distance, using 16 pulses per symbol,
reordering of all bits reduces the single- and multi-power
attacker success to no more than 4.5 · 10−5 and 1.1 · 10−3,
respectively. The typical
length of nonces nV E and nP R
as used in distance-bounding protocols amounts to 20 bits.
Extrapolating from our results, reordering all 20 nonce bits
will decrease the attacker’s chances of success further, likely
below the 10−6 mark for the single-power attacker.
A system implementing UWB-PR faces the choice of how to
split up the nonces into groups of bits that are reordered. Either
all bits of the nonce can be reordered (i.e. NB = |nV E| =
|nP R|), or the nonces can be split into groups before reordering
(i.e. NB 1MHz, where the power per pulse is limited by the
regulatory constraint on average power [14]. Speciﬁcally, the
comparably high PRFs supported by 802.15.4a are associated
with small marginal SNR increases per pulse added. But
each pulse added to the burst will proportionally increase its
length Tburst, and give the attacker more time. This results
in an unfavorable trade-off between performance and security,
especially at high PRFs. Consequently, an 802.15.4a ranging
system can be geared towards either security or performance,
but not both.
In particular, all conﬁgurations place less energy on each
pulse than the extended mode of 802.15.4f. This requires
8Under the assumption that the attacker’s processing time is lower bounded
by a few nanoseconds.
9In this analysis, we use a simpliﬁed model on signal energy under
regulatory constraints which do not consider non-idealities of the measurement
hardware as introduced in [14].

conﬁgurations to compensate excessively with temporal diver-
sity in order to achieve comparable receive SNR. Indeed, the
standard allows for long burst durations of up to roughly 256ns
(125 times the minimum), along with proportionally increasing
symbol durations. Unfortunately, for the highest mandatory
PRF of 15.6MHz, this leads to a potential 153.6m and 2461.6m
distance decrease by an ED/LC attacker in a coherent or non-
coherent setting, respectively. Although one could argue that
the option for shorter burst duration exists, a system opting for
robust communication over distances exceeding a few meters
will have no other choice than introducing temporal diversity
and, due to FCC/ETSI regulations, longer symbol lengths. This
becomes evident in Figure 13 when considering the NLoS path
loss model which assumes a 20dB signal attenuation to an
object (e.g., human body) blocking the direct path. We note
that temporal diversity for meaningful operating distances is
essential in any UWB system and also strongly incentivized
by the 802.15.4a standard. We argue that 802.15.4a does even
more so than 802.15.4f, since it operates with each pulse well
below the peak power constraint of 0dBm per 50MHz, thereby
relying even more on the temporal spreading of transmitting
power. The core weakness of 802.15.4a, however,
is that
temporal diversity can only be gained by increasing the burst
duration Tburst, which is not secure.
We exemplify this problem by comparing conﬁgurations of
802.15.4a and UWB-PR operating over identical bandwidths
and allocating similar symbol energy under regulatory con-
straints. This way, we aim to compare conﬁgurations expected
to offer similar ranges. With our proposed 16 pulses per
symbol and mean pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 2MHz
in UWB-PR, we ﬁnd in the 802.15.4a-conﬁguration using 32
pulses per burst over a symbol duration of 8205.13ns our
closest ﬁt. In the coherent scenario, denoted as 802.15.4a (C),
an attacker can decrease the distance by close to 20m, as
compared to only less than 1m in UWB-PR. Even worse, if
the system chooses to not convey any information in the signal
phase, the modulation reduces to pure BPM, and the attacker
can guess the symbol value ca. half a symbol duration in ad-
vance [26]. An attacker can then simply adapt his transmission
power in the second symbol half to what he observes in the
ﬁrst half of the legitimate symbol. Correspondingly, the maxi-
