Hello everybody,
I have downloaded a wav file from the web, this is the link:
http://freesound.org/people/RHumphries/sounds/980/
Since I have not found out how to attach this file to the bug report anybody
who tries to reproduce the problem will have to download the sound. If I am
trying to read this file using the function 'scipy.io.wavfile.read' I get an
error message. Here is the minimal code example:
In [1]: import scipy.io.wavfile as wav  
In [2]: rate,f=wav.read('980__rhumphries__rbh-glass-break-04.wav')
This gives me the following error: "ValueError: string size must be a multiple
of element size"
Since the function is working fine with all the other wav files that I have I
suspect that this is a bug.
