User: You are developing a RESTful API and need to understand how to design and implement common HTTP error codes and return data formats. Please provide a design specification.
Assistant: The design specifications of the RESTful API should include the following aspects: 1. The use of HTTP error codes HTTP error codes are very important. They are used to indicate the status of the API and inform the client whether the result returned by the API is successful. The following are some common HTTP error codes: - 200 OK: Indicates that the request was successful - 201 Created: Indicates that a new resource was successfully created - 204 No Content: Indicates that a resource was successfully deleted or updated - 400 Bad Request: Indicates a syntax error in the client request or Illegal - 401 Unauthorized: Indicates that the client is unauthorized to access a protected resource - 403 Forbidden: Indicates that the client does not have permission to access the resource - 404 Not Found: Indicates that the requested resource was not found - 500 Internal Server Error: Indicates that the server is processing An error was encountered during the request 2. Unification of the returned data format In order to ensure that the data format returned by the API is consistent, a unified data structure should be defined so that the client can process them conveniently. In general, an API should return a JSON object containing the following fields: - status: represents the status of the API request, usually using an HTTP error code - message: information about the response - data: the data returned by the API, which may be a JSON object or an array 3. Caching of returned data In order to improve the performance of the API, caching is necessary. When implementing caching, the following issues need to be taken into consideration: - Which headers can be set for each resource to indicate that the resource should be cached - What is the cache duration - When should the cache be refreshed 4. Localization of error messages in order to ensure API ease of use and reliability, localization of error messages should be considered. Localization allows APIs to return language-specific error messages, improving user experience. 5. API documentation API documentation is an integral part of RESTful API design. API documentation should provide implementation details of the API, including how to use the API and how to handle errors. To sum up, the design specification of RESTful API should include HTTP error code, return data format, cache of return data, localization of error message and API documentation. These considerations ensure API scalability, reliability, and ease of use.
