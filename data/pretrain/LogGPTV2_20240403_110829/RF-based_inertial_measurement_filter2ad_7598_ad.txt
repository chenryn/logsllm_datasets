of 2.3 cm for the more stable, thus better aligned, desktop moving.
For the less controlled cart movement, it yields 8.4 cm median error.
Specifically, it yields 7.3 cm median accuracy in LOS scenarios and,
more importantly, a similar accuracy of 8.6 cm in complex NLOS
conditions. The 90%tile and maximum errors are under 15 cm and
21 cm, respectively. We do not include results using accelerometer
because it easily produces errors of tens of meters [44]. To the
best of our knowledge, no existing system can achieve comparable
performance under similar settings (i.e., NLOS over a large area
using a single unknown AP). Improved tracking accuracy of RIM
is due to its novel method in utilizing rich multipath profiles as
distinct spatio-temporal virtual antennas.
6.2.2 Accuracy of heading direction. We study RIM’s heading
direction estimation accuracy by moving the hexagonal array in
diverse directions. In particular, we traverse a 90◦ range with an
increased step of 10◦, together with each of their opposite directions.
For each direction, we move the device for about 1 meter and
examine the heading direction estimation errors. As depicted in
Fig. 12a, RIM correctly identifies the closest heading direction that
it can resolve for most cases, except for a few outliers (e.g., in
direction -40◦ and -20◦). Fig. 12b further integrates the results for
all directions, which shows that >90% of heading errors are within
10◦, with an overall average accuracy of 6.1◦. Most of the estimates
are either correct without any error (e.g., well-aligned directions) or
with 10◦ errors (e.g., deviated directions), because RIM only resolves
a set of discrete directions that are integral multiples of 30◦. We
will further demonstrate RIM’s heading estimation performance
for free movements in real applications in the next section. Again,
the magnetometer is not compared here because it can not address
heading direction.
6.2.3 Accuracy of rotating angle. To evaluate rotating angle ac-
curacy, we attach the hexagonal array on a fan and manually rotate
the array for different angles, ranging from 30◦ to 360◦. We repeat
each angle for 10 times and calculate the relative errors. As shown
in Fig. 13, RIM tracks rotating angles with a median error of 30.1◦
(about 17.6% in relative error) for the total 80 tests, corresponding
to an error of merely 1.3 cm in arc lengths (i.e., moving distances).
Unfortunately, gyroscope produces much better results in this case.
The currently achieved performance of RIM is limited by that the
antenna separation is at the same magnitude as the array radius.
Given that the adjacent antenna separation and radius are both
half wavelength for the hexagonal array, even a 0.5 cm error in the

distance could lead to 11◦ error in rotating angle. Nevertheless, the
results still validate the feasibility of RIM’s rotating angle sensing
capability, which will be drastically improved by denser and smaller
antenna array in the future.

would be interesting to examine how RIM performs with respect to
different movement lengths. We move for about 10 m for multiple
times and calculate the tracking errors during trace progressing. As
shown in Fig. 15, the median errors in moving distance vary from
about 3 cm to 14 cm, which do not considerably accumulate over
long distances. The performance is further confirmed by longer
traces as shown later in Fig. 20. The performance gains attribute to
RIM’s high precision in speed estimation, which does not drift over
time. In practice, however, we note an error correction mechanism
may be needed to overcome potential accumulative errors (See an
example of tracking in Fig. 21).
Figure 15: Impact of movement distances.
Figure 13: Accuracy of rotating angle.
6.2.4 Coverage and impacts of AP locations. RIM can work any-
where the AP signals can reach. To study whether AP location
affects its performance, we place the AP at different locations, as
marked in Fig. 10, and perform distance measurements in the mid-
dle open spaces. As shown in Fig. 14, RIM achieves consistently
high median accuracy of less than 10 cm for any AP location, be
it close LOS or far away through multiple walls and pillars. The
results show RIM is truly multipath resilient and achieves best-ever
coverage, which allows it to work wherever there are WiFi signals.
Impact of accumulative distance. Inertial sensors are known
to suffer from accumulative errors over long trajectories. As a rela-
tive tracking approach, however, errors may accumulate. Thus it
6.2.5
6.2.6
Impact of sampling rate. Sufficient sampling rate is re-
quired to achieve high accuracy in RIM. Thus we downsample the
CSI from 200Hz down to 20Hz and rerun the distance tracking. The
results are integrated in Fig. 16. As expected, the distance track-
ing accuracy increases with higher sampling rates. For a moving
speed of 1 m/s, a sampling rate of 20Hz or 40Hz is not enough,
which results in about a displacement of 5 cm per sample. To en-
sure sub-centimeter displacement within one sample, at least 100
Hz is needed for a speed of 1 m/s. Higher sampling rate may further
improve the accuracy, yet the improvement would be marginal com-
pared to the computation overhead incurred. In general, the target
moving speed is the major factor determining the required sam-
pling rate. Faster speeds demand higher sampling rates to gather
adequate samples during a movement of ∆d. Higher sampling rates,
however, are not requested by factors like environmental dynamics.
Impact of virtual antenna number. Using virtual massive
antennas is a key to boost RIM’s resolution. Thus we study how

core modules run in real-time, using around 6% of CPU and about
10 MB of RAM.
6.3 Applications
RIM has a range of potential applications in indoor tracking, hand-
writing, gesture control, movement detection, VR headset tracking,
drone tracking, etc. In this section, we evaluate RIM in three ap-
plication scenarios. Note that existing state-of-the-art in motion
tracking [13, 14] may also support some of these applications under
their favored settings, yet at considerably high costs. However, we
do not compare with them since they do not work in the same
conditions as RIM (i.e., single AP with unknown location and NLOS
cases with rich multipaths).
6.3.1 Desktop Handwriting. With RIM’s fine precision in motion
tracking, it supports handwriting on a whiteboard or desk. To show
a proof-of-concept scenario, we ask a user to move the antenna
array by freely writing some letters on a desk surface. Fig. 18 depicts
some examples of the recovered letters, with comparison to the
ground truths captured by a camera system. Due to lack of precise
timing-synchronization between the trajectories tracked by RIM
and the camera, we approximate the tracking error as the minimum
projection distance from the estimated location to the trajectory.
As seen, RIM accurately reconstructs not only relatively straight
segments but also curved strokes in different directions, resulting in
recognizable letters. Specifically, the mean error of the trajectories
of the letters written in Fig. 18 is 2.4 cm, similar to the errors of
straight line trajectories (Fig. 14). Albeit currently the antenna array
may be too large to act as a “pen”, we demonstrate our technology
will directly shape it for writing when smaller antennas with shorter
wavelengths become ubiquitous in the near future.

ries in green are estimates of RIM, while the gray ones are the
ground truths captured by a camera.
6.3.2 Gesture Recognition. We demonstrate a gesture control
application by integrating RIM into a pointer-like unit, as shown
in Fig. 9(c). To make it compact, we use one WiFi NIC with three
small chip antennas arranged in an “L” shape. The experiments
involve three users, each performing four different gestures (moving
towards left/right/up/down and then back) for 20 times with their
left and right hand, respectively. In total, we collect 480 actions
for testing. As shown in Fig. 19a, RIM will observe speed in one
direction in which the user’s hand moves towards, immediately
followed by a speed in the opposite direction when the hand moves
back, from a specific pair of antenna depending on the moving
direction. We use this information to detect and identify a gesture.
Fig. 19b illustrates the recognition results. Since all detected
gestures are all correctly recognized, we only plot the detection
rates. As shown, RIM achieves an average detection accuracy of
96.25% for different gestures and users, with 23 miss detections
(4.79%) and 5 false triggers (1.04%) over the total of 480 tests. The

the number of virtual antennas impacts accuracy. As shown in Fig.
17, we increase the virtual antenna number V from 1 to 100 and
calculate the distance errors. The results show the median accuracy
decreases from about 30 cm to 10 cm when V increases from 1
to 5, and further reduces to 6.6 cm when V = 100. In practice, a
number larger than 30 should suffice for a sampling rate of 200Hz
and should be larger for higher sampling rate and smaller for lower.
Figure 17: Impact of virtual antenna number.
6.2.8 Robustness to environmental dynamics. Building upon spa-
tial multipath profiles, it is interesting to see if RIM is immune to
common environmental dynamics, e.g., walking humans. Consider-
ing our experiments, there are always at least two persons doing
the experiments, in addition to others performing normal activities
around the environment. Imagine when a user moves the device
(e.g., pushing a cart), both his/her body and the cart are moving
closely to the receiver, altering the multipath distributions. Yet the
above results show robustness to these kinds of dynamics. The
reasons are two-fold: 1) There are a number of multipaths indoors
[8], coming from different directions. As a walking human will only
change part of them, the TRRS behavior underpinning RIM still
holds. 2) RIM does not rely on absolute TRRS, which may vary with
environmental dynamics.
6.2.9
System complexity. The main computation burden lies in
the calculation of TRRS. For every sample, RIM needs to calculate
TRRS over a window of 2W , leading to m × (m − 1) × W values in
total for an array of m antennas. Since the MATLAB code is not
optimized for speed, we measure the C++ system on Surface Pro,
which is equipped with Intel Core i7 4650U and 8 GB RAM. RIM’s

false trigger rate is less than the miss detection rate, which is also
favored in practical cases because one can simply repeat the gesture
for miss detection while a false trigger is annoying. Moreover, the
performance is consistently high across different users and actions,
and left/right hands. The results demonstrate promising gesture
capability that can, e.g., turn a smartphone into a presentation
pointer.
6.3.3
Indoor Tracking. We particularly implement two differ-
ent cases to extensively demonstrate RIM’s capability for indoor
tracking. During the tracking test, the AP is placed at location #0.
Pure RIM for indoor tracking: We first deploy RIM with hexag-
onal array as a sole tracking system over the whole floorplan in
Fig. 10. The antenna array is put on a cart, which is pushed by a
user along different traces. To particularly show RIM in the case
of sideway movements (i.e., changing heading direction without
turning), which are common in industrial Automated Guided Vehi-
cles (AGVs), we directly move the cart sideway, instead of making
a turn, in this experiment. Fig. 20 illustrates two example trajec-
tories, about 36 m and 76 m respectively with multiple sideway
movements. As seen, the trajectories are accurately tracked and
no significant errors accumulate, even for very long traces over a
large area. Note that conventional inertial sensors, gyroscope, and
magnetometer, fail to capture such direction changes because there
is no turning, meaning that the device orientation keeps the same
although the heading direction has changed.
RIM integrated with inertial sensors: RIM has superior advan-
tages in moving distance estimation, even with only three antennas.
To fully reveal its potential with COTS WiFi devices with only one
NIC, we implement a system by integrating RIM’s distance mea-
surement with direction information reported by the gyroscope.
Specifically, we use the Galileo Gen2 board equipped with one WiFi
NIC of three chip antennas and the BNO055 sensor unit.
We test the integrated tracking system by putting the device
on a cart and pushing it throughout the whole floor, as the way a
customer pushes a shopping cart in a mall, or a smart home robot
moves around. Fig. 21 illustrates an example tracking result, with
an initial location and direction given in advance. As seen, while
the distances, measured by RIM, are highly accurate, the direction
information obtained by inertial sensors may suffer from large
errors. To put it into a practical system, we implement a particle
filter (PF) to leverage the geometric constraints provided by the
Figure 20: Tracking by sole RIM. Both traces contain sideway
movements that inertial sensors do not support.
Figure 21: Tracking by RIM integrated with sensors. The re-
sults are obtained by fusing the distance estimates by RIM and
direction estimates by inertial sensors.
digital floorplan to correct errors. The PF will discard every particle
that hits a wall and let others survive. The result, with PF based
enhancement, gracefully reconstructs the real trajectory, as shown
in Fig. 21. Relying on only one single AP with unknown information,
the encouraging results demonstrate the great potential of RIM in
enabling ubiquitous and accurate indoor tracking system especially
for robots and objects, a long-standing challenging problem that
has attracted numerous research efforts.
7 DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
RIM is an early step towards ubiquitous and precise RF-based in-
ertial measurements, and there is obviously room for continued
research in various perspectives.
Antenna array: The current prototype of RIM employs two COTS
WiFi cards. As WiFi technology matures with many antennas and at
higher frequencies, e.g., 60 GHz, one single radio will be abundant
and the size will be smaller to be embedded in mobiles. For the cur-
rent prototype, RIM with its relatively large form factor is already
attractive especially for dedicated interactive gaming devices and
