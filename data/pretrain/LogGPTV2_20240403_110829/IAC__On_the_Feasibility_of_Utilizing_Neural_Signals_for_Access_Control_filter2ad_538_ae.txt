trol systems, our approach is not limited to user-initiated events.
Because any external stimulus, including viewing an app’s fore-
ground GUI context can be used to create event-related potentials
(ERPs) and drive our system.
Decision prediction. The second approach is to use machine learn-
ing (ML) to predict users’ privacy decisions [36, 47, 65, 66]. Liuet
al. [36] proposed using user’s answers to a few privacy related
questions to build a personalized privacy prole. They then create a
Privacy Assistant that oer recommendations for future permission
settings based on the prole, apps category, requested permission,
and purposes associated with the permission. While they found
that 78.8% of the recommendations were adopted by users, the
biggest limitation is that they used the ask-on-install model so the
recommendations were made without considering context. Recog-
nizing the importance of context integrity, Wijesekera et al. [65]
pioneered the work on predicting user’s privacy decisions based
on the context. In their rst attempt, they used a one-size-ts-all
logistic regression model which can provide 40%-60% better ac-
curacy than random guessing. In [66], they further extended this
idea by building a SVM-based classier based on when context has
changed and user’s past decisions and behavior. This new approach
IAC: On the Feasibility of Utilizing Neural Signals for
Access Control
improved the accuracy to 96.8% across all users. However, the accu-
racy drops to 80% among users who truly make dierent decisions
based on context. Around the same time, Olejnik et al. [47] also
propose using context information and ML technique to predict
user’s privacy decisions. In this work, they used 32 raw contextual
features (e.g., app name, foreground app, method, time, semantic
location) to train a linear regression model based on users’ previous
decisions under dierent contexts. The mean correct classication
rate of their model is 80%. Our approach also relies on ML tech-
niques and our learning strategy is very close to [66]. However,
instead of trying to encode context as a set of features to the ML
techniques, we rely on users to interpret the context and aim to
infer what they want to do under the given context.
9 CONCLUSION
In this work, we proposed a new direction to protect user-owned,
security and privacy sensitive sensors and resources—by inferring
user’s intents and use it to automate authorization decisions. As a
rst step, we studied the feasibility of leveraging the brain-computer
interface to infer the intents. Our experiment with 41 participants
showed that neural signals can be utilized to train a machine learn-
ing classier to recognize high-level intents like taking a photo. The
accuracy of the classier was also good enough for this security
and privacy sensitive task.
