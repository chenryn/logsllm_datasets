A. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Graphical passwords are considered as usable alternatives
to textual passwords as they exploit the superior ability of
human brain to remember visual information. According to
dual-coding theory [9], verbal (word-based) and non-verbal
(image-based) memory are processed and represented diﬀer-
ently in the brain. The storage of graphical information is a
one-step process while the storage of textual information is
a two-step process and thus requires more eﬀort. Therefore,
graphical passwords are a promising avenue to explore.
Depending on the memory task involved in remembering
and entering password, graphical schemes are broadly clas-
siﬁed into three categories, namely, recognition-based, cued
recall-based and recall-based [7]. Pass-Go [12] is an exam-
ple of recall-based scheme in which user selects one or more
strokes on a n × n grid. The 3X3 pattern unlock scheme is
an instance of Pass-Go, especially tailored for the hand-held
mobile devices. (The name Pass-O for our circular layout
is partly inspired from Pass-Go. Dropping the letter ‘G’ for
Grid from Pass-Go yields Pass-O.)
A.1 Attacks on Pattern Unlock Scheme
Although pattern-based graphical schemes are usable, they
are susceptible to a wide variety of attacks including guess-
ing attacks and shoulder-surﬁng attacks. In this section, we
give a brief overview of these attacks and diﬀerentiate our
work from the prior studies.
Guessing Attacks.
In 2013, Uellenbeck et al. [13] col-
lected approximately 2,900 patterns from 584 participants
on 5 diﬀerent layouts and demonstrated that the security of
3X3 patterns is less than a 3-digit random PIN. The authors
found that most users use only horizontal and vertical lines
to create their 3X3 patterns and that 43% of participants
begin their patterns with an upper-left node. To eliminate
these biases, authors also tested four alternate layouts, of
which the circular layout improved security.
Their circular layout citeUellenbeck:guessing consisted of
9 nodes of which 8 nodes were placed along the circumfer-
ence of a circle while the remaining ninth node was placed
in the center. Due to this arrangement, two nodes at diag-
onal ends could not be connected directly without passing
through the center node. This arrangement allows a total
space of 645,504 patterns, 1.6 times more than 3,89,112 pat-
terns possible on 3X3 grid layout. In Pass-O, we arrange
all 9 nodes along the circumference of a circle, so that any
node can be connected to any other node, which gives a full
space of 9,85,824, about 2.5 times more than that of 3X3 grid
layout and 1.5 times more than the circular layout of [13].
Recently, Aviv et al. [6] studied the security of patterns
drawn on 4X4 grid and found that most of the 4X4 patterns
are just extended versions of 3X3 patterns. These results
were based on 494 patterns collected from 80 participants.
In this paper, we report the largest pattern study conducted
till date. We collect 69,797 3X3 patterns and 53,383 Pass-O
patterns from 21,053 participants. We ﬁnd that the guessing
resistance of 3X3 patterns is much less than that reported
in the literature [6, 13]. In addition to providing a reliable
security estimate of 3X3 patterns, we also test the security
of a new layout (Pass-O). Further, we share a list of 500
most popular 3X3 and Pass-O patterns from our dataset [1].
Shoulder-surﬁng Attacks. The graphical patterns are
prone to shoulder-surﬁng attacks and to thwart them several
pattern strength meters have been proposed [4, 10, 11]. The
objective of the strength meters is to nudge users to create
visually complex patterns. The more complex the pattern
appears, the harder for the observer to memorize it.
The strength meter proposed by Androitis et al. [4] relies
on 5 diﬀerent features to determine the pattern complex-
ity, namely starting point, length, direction changes, knight
moves and overlapping nodes. Sun et al. [11] determined the
pattern strength based on length, stroke length, number of
intersections and number of overlaps. Later, Song et al. [10]
also attributed the pattern complexity to length, number of
intersections and number of non-repeated segments.
In this paper, we characterize the visual complexity of 3X3
and Pass-O patterns using features such as pattern length,
stroke length, number of intersections and direction changes.
We ﬁrst adapt and implement the 3X3 pattern strength me-
ters [4, 10, 11] for Pass-O and then compare the security of
3X3 and Pass-O patterns against shoulder-surﬁng attacks.

INTERSECTION PROOF
Proof. First, we count the number of paths that contain
an intersection x between the given two line segments s1
and s2 on n-node Pass-O (Figure 4c). To construct a path
of length n − j containing the intersecting line segments s1
and s2, we drop j nodes from the remaining n − 4 nodes.
This can be done in n−4C j ways. For counting purpose, we
coalesce two nodes of line segment s1 into one node and two
nodes of line segment s2 into another. After coalescing, we
are left with n − 2 nodes. As there are (n − j − 2)! diﬀerent
paths of length n − j and the nodes connecting each of the
line segments s1 and s2 can be visited in 2! ways, we have
#paths with intersection x =
n−4C j · (n − 2 − j)! · 2!2!
n−4(cid:88)
j=0
After simpliﬁcation we get
= 4(n − 4)! · n−4(cid:88)
= 4(n − 4)! ·(cid:16) n−4(cid:88)

≈ 4(n − 4)! · e · ((n − 2)(n − 3) − (2n − 5) + 2)
= 4(n − 4)! · e · (n2 − 7n + 13)
This gives the number of paths containing a particular in-
tersection x. Now, any 4 points in a n-node Pass-O deﬁne
one unique intersection. Hence, there are nC 4 intersections.
Also by Theorem 1 there are n!·e diﬀerent paths. Therefore,
the average number of intersections is given by
µintersection = nC 4 · 4(n − 4)! · e · (n2 − 7n + 13)
n! · e

C. SHOULDER-SURFING
In section 5, we found that features such as longer length,
longer strokes and intersections are pre-dominantly present
in Pass-O patterns. These features add to the visual com-
plexity of patterns and therefore provide better security against
406shoulder-surﬁng attacks [4, 10, 11]. The intuition is that hu-
mans can store very few items in the short term memory.
Therefore, if a pattern is longer and visually complex it is
diﬃcult for a human observer to memorize the pattern in
just one observation. To determine the visual complexity
of 3X3 patterns, few strength meters have been proposed
in the literature [4, 10, 11]. We adapt these algorithms for
Pass-O and measure the shoulder-surﬁng resistance of 3X3
and Pass-O patterns. Due to space constraints, we report
on the combined list of defensive and oﬀensive patterns.
LNCS Strength Meter. Andriotis et al. [4] used 5 diﬀer-
ent features to determine the complexity of 3X3 patterns,
namely starting point, number of nodes, direction changes,
knight moves and overlapping nodes. The longer patterns
that begin with any but upper-left node, that contains knight
moves, overlaps (line segments with length > 1.414) and
direction changes are assigned highest scores. A direction
change in the pattern occurs when an angle is formed be-
tween two consecutive strokes. For instance, the consecutive
line segments 1 → 2 and 2 → 5 on 3X3 grid constitute a di-
rection change, while the line segments 1 → 2 and 2 → 3
constitute no direction change. This strength meter weighs
every feature equally and classiﬁes all patterns into three
categories, weak, medium and strong.
We use the same 5 features to classify Pass-O patterns as
well. The starting point (top-most node) and the number of
nodes are trivial to ﬁnd but we need an equivalent notion of
knight and overlapping moves in the Pass-O context. Since
knight moves in 3X3 grid are nothing but strokes of longer
lengths, we consider the line segments of length 1.732 and
1.970 in Pass-O as knight moves. Overlap is a unique feature
of the 3X3 grid and therefore we set the value of overlapping
feature for Pass-O patterns as 0. Further, straight lines are
not possible on circular layout as there is always an angle
between every consecutive strokes (chords), hence most of
the Pass-O patterns will be classiﬁed as strong. To prevent
this, we slightly alter the deﬁnition of a direction change.
We say that a direction change in the pattern occurs if
two consecutive strokes have diﬀerent lengths. For instance,
the consecutive line segments 1 → 2 and 2 → 3 on circular
layout are of same length and therefore they do not consti-
tute a direction change, but 1 → 2 and 2 → 7 are of diﬀerent
lengths and as per our deﬁnition they constitute a direction
change. Therefore, simple 3X3 patterns such as ‘L’ and ‘S’
and Pass-O patterns of the form 123456789 which are com-
posed entirely of similar line segments have zero direction
changes. The average number of direction changes in Pass-
O (3.68) is 1.7 times higher than that of 3X3 pattern (2.19).
The distribution is shown in Figure 4e.
JISA Strength Meter. The strength meter proposed by
Sun et al. [11] computes shoulder-surﬁng resistance using en-
tropy like formula by employing 4 diﬀerent features, namely
stroke length, pattern length, number of intersections and
overlaps. Again, while quantifying the complexity of Pass-
O patterns, we set the overlap feature value to zero. Also,
the authors used a 5 point interval scale (very weak to very
strong) to measure the shoulder-surﬁng resistance of 3X3
patterns, however to be consistent with the scales of other
two strength meters, we convert this 5 point scale into 3
point scale by merging patterns that belong to very weak
and weak categories into a single class and patterns that be-
long to very strong and strong categories into another class.

Figure 7: Shoulder-Surﬁng resistance of 3X3 and Pass-O
data as computed using 3 distinct strength meters [4, 10, 11]
tures, namely pattern length, number of non-repeated seg-
ments and intersections to determine the shoulder-surﬁng re-
sistance of 3X3 patterns. The idea behind non-repeated seg-
ments is similar to that of direction change given by us. The
authors performed shoulder-surﬁng experiments and learned
relative weights of these 3 features. The weight of the pat-
tern length was found to be 0.81 and that of intersections
to be 0.15. The authors used chess board distance to com-
pute the segment length i.e. the distance between two nodes
(x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is simply max(|x1 − x2|,|y1 − y2|). Our
pattern strength evaluation considers Euclidean distance as
opposed to chess board distance metric.
Figure 7 depicts the shoulder-surﬁng resistance of 3X3
and Pass-O patterns as evaluated by these 3 meters. LNCS
meter classiﬁed most of 3X3 and Pass-O patterns as strong.
JISA meter determined only 12.59% of 3X3 patterns as strong
whereas it classiﬁed 43.09% of Pass-O patterns (3.4 times
higher) as strong. Similarly, CHI meter classiﬁed only 5.25%
of 3X3 patterns as strong while in case of Pass-O, the per-
centage is nearly 6.9 times higher (36.40%).
