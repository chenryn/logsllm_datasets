## Abstract
The advent of 5G services presents numerous opportunities for networked applications. This study addresses two key questions: (i) whether the throughput of mmWave 5G is predictable, and (ii) if it is possible to develop effective machine learning (ML) models for 5G throughput prediction. We conducted a comprehensive measurement study of commercial mmWave 5G services in a major U.S. city, focusing on the throughput experienced by applications running on user equipment (UE). Through extensive experiments and statistical analysis, we identified key UE-side factors that influence 5G performance and quantified the extent to which 5G throughput can be predicted. We then introduced Lumos5G, a composable ML framework that considers various features and their combinations, applying state-of-the-art ML techniques for context-aware 5G throughput predictions. Our framework achieved a 1.37× to 4.84× reduction in prediction error compared to existing models. This work serves as a feasibility study for developing a dynamic 5G throughput map, akin to Google traffic maps, and highlights the opportunities and challenges in building 5G-aware applications.

## 1. Introduction
With the new radio (NR) specifications (5G NR [19]) covering a wide spectrum of frequencies from low-band, mid-band, to high-band with flexible waveform, 5G cellular technology is expected to offer a range of new services, including Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), and enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB). These services enable exciting new applications such as (Industrial) Internet-of-Things (IoT), autonomous driving, Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), and ultra-HD interactive video services.

In 2019, 5G services were commercially deployed in the U.S. and globally, primarily using 5G NR mid-band and low-band frequencies, with a few using 5G NR millimeter wave (mmWave) high-band frequencies (e.g., Verizon in the U.S.). We are particularly interested in mmWave 5G performance due to its ultra-high bandwidth (theoretically up to 20 Gbps), which offers significant opportunities for emerging and future bandwidth-intensive applications. However, mmWave radios face many technical challenges, such as directionality, limited range, and high sensitivity to obstructions, making the design and management of 5G services based on mmWave radio a complex task.

Our recent measurement study of commercial 5G services in the U.S. [47] has shown both the potential and challenges of mmWave 5G:
- **Opportunities:** Commercial mmWave 5G services can provide ultra-high bandwidth (up to 2 Gbps), enabling new classes of high-bandwidth applications.
- **Challenges:** 5G performance can fluctuate significantly over time and location, sometimes dropping below 4G levels or to nearly zero (5G "dead zones").

Given these findings, it is essential to develop new tools and mechanisms to help eMBB applications effectively leverage the ultra-high bandwidth offered by 5G while mitigating its challenges, making them 5G-aware.

## 2. Background & Overview
### 2.1 5G Deployment & Measurement
Today's commercial 5G services are deployed in the non-standalone (NSA) mode, where 5G NR shares the 4G packet core infrastructure. 5G "towers" are either co-located with or close to 4G towers. The benefits of 5G primarily come from 5G NR, which encompasses a wide spectrum from low-band (sub-1 GHz) to high-band (above 24 GHz) frequencies. Low-band and mid-band 5G form the basis of most initial 5G service deployments, offering moderately higher bandwidth than existing 4G LTE or advanced LTE services. High-band 5G, which covers mmWave frequency bands, theoretically offers up to 20 Gbps but provides considerably lower bandwidth in practice.

The commercial deployment of 5G services provides an opportunity for in-field measurements of 5G performance, especially for mmWave 5G, which is highly sensitive to various radio signal quality impairments and environmental factors [17, 31, 33, 39, 40, 66]. Our recent work [47] conducted a measurement study of commercial 5G deployment, including mid-band and mmWave 5G services offered by several carriers in the U.S. It showed that commercial mmWave 5G services can deliver up to 2 Gbps per UE, but their performance is subject to various environmental and other factors.

Building on [47], which provides a broad, general measurement study of 5G performance, this paper focuses on understanding the key user-side factors affecting mmWave 5G throughput performance and how to build effective ML models that can utilize these factors to predict 5G throughput. Hereafter, unless explicitly stated, 5G refers to mmWave 5G. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate sample 5G throughput traces under different mobility scenarios, showing that 5G throughput can vary widely, from as high as 2 Gbps to as low as nearly 0. User mobility and obstructions create frequent handoffs, posing significant challenges for applications relying on the ultra-high bandwidth of mmWave 5G eMBB services.

### 2.2 Case for Mapping & Predicting mmWave 5G Throughput
#### Why 5G Throughput Mapping?
Signal strength, spectrum, and channel state measurements have been widely studied in wireless and cellular networks, often from the perspective of a cellular provider, e.g., for 3G/4G cellular channel scheduling. Several studies have shown that even in the case of 3G/4G, the performance can vary significantly. For mmWave 5G, the high variability in throughput poses additional challenges. Therefore, mapping 5G throughput is crucial for understanding and predicting performance.

#### Why an ML-Based Approach?
Given the diverse impact factors and their complex interplay on 5G performance, data-driven, ML-based tools are essential for throughput prediction. Such tools can aid in bandwidth adaptation, maximizing user quality-of-experience (QoE), and providing context-specific information to mobile applications.

## 3. Key Contributions and Roadmap
- **Measurement Platform:** Due to the lack of publicly available tools/APIs for 5G measurements, we developed our own 5G service monitoring and throughput measurement platform (§3.1). We conducted extensive, repeated on-field experiments for 5G throughput data collection in a large U.S. city. Our dataset, after cleaning, contains throughput samples captured by walking over 331 km and driving over 132 km (§3.2), part of which is available on our website: https://lumos5g.umn.edu.
- **Empirical Analysis:** We identified several UE-side factors and decomposed them into quantifiable factors. In §4, we conducted empirical and statistical analyses to understand their impact on 5G throughput behavior and predictability. We found that 5G throughput performance is influenced by a wide spectrum of factors and their interactions, which are more complex than those in traditional cellular technologies like 3G and 4G.
- **Lumos5G Framework:** Based on our measurement findings, we developed Lumos5G, a holistic and robust ML framework that predicts 5G throughput both qualitatively (via classification) and quantitatively (via regression). Our framework judiciously considers different feature groups (geographic location, mobility, tower-based, radio connection) and their combinations. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to examine the predictability of commercial 5G performance using real-world data.
- **Evaluation and Results:** Using Lumos5G, we conducted extensive evaluations and demonstrated that it achieves accurate and reliable 5G throughput prediction. Our framework, powered by judicious feature and ML model selection, achieves an overall weighted average F1 score of up to 0.96 (with three prediction classes) and a 1.37× to 4.84× reduction in throughput prediction error compared to existing approaches designed for 3G/4G (§6.3-§7). Finally, we discuss other interesting research opportunities resulting from our work (§8).

This structured approach provides a clear and professional overview of the research, highlighting the key contributions and the significance of the work.
