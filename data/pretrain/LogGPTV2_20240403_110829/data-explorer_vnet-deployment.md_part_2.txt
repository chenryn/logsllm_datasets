## ExpressRoute setup
Use ExpressRoute to connect on premises network to the Azure Virtual Network. A common setup is to advertise the default route (0.0.0.0/0) through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session. This forces traffic coming out of the Virtual Network to be forwarded to the customer's premise network that may drop the traffic, causing outbound flows to break. To overcome this default, [User Defined Route (UDR)](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview#user-defined) (0.0.0.0/0) can be configured and next hop will be *Internet*. Since the UDR takes precedence over BGP, the traffic will be destined to the Internet.
## Securing outbound traffic with a firewall
If you want to secure outbound traffic using [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview) or any virtual appliance to limit domain names, the following Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) must be allowed in the firewall.
