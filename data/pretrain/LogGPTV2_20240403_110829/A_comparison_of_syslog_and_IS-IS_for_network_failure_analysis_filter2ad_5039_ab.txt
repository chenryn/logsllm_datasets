Syslog and IS-IS LSPs use different naming conventions (host-
names vs. OSI IDs). To overcome the inability to directly
compare router names in LSPs and syslog messages we de-
velop a simple method to map both to a common naming con-
vention, a link: (host name 1:port on host 1, host
name 2:port on host 2). In order to perform this mapping
we determine all of the links in the network by mining an archive
of conﬁguration ﬁles.
We consider an IS-IS failure event (i.e., a down transition fol-
lowed by an up transition) and a syslog failure event to be matched
if both are on the same link, their start times are within ten seconds,
and their end times are within ten seconds. We choose a window
size of ten seconds because there is a clear knee at ten seconds

matched (omitted for space). We also ﬁnd it useful to compare
transitions individually; state transitions are similarly considered
to match if they occur with ten seconds of each other on the same
link.
IS reachability vs. IP reachability
IS-IS LSPs contain two ﬁelds
that can be used to infer link state: IS reachability and IP reachabil-
ity. We therefore have to choose which of the two ﬁelds two use. If
we choose to use the IS reachability ﬁeld there is a limitation that
it is not always possible to differentiate between one or multiple
physical links between two routers1. In the CENIC network, 26
device pairs have such multi-link adjacencies. We omit multi-link
adjacencies from our analysis because, unlike all other links in the
network, their state is actually function of n-physical links.
Router interfaces that form links in the CENIC network are given
IP addresses in unique /31 subnets. This means that the IP reacha-
bility ﬁeld can uniquely identify every link. As a result it initially
appears that using IP reachability to determine link state would be
superior since it does not ignore 20% of all links.
Table 2 shows what percentage of all state changes, as observed
by either IS or IP reachability, match syslog state state changes that
refer to IS-IS connectivity or the status of the underlying physical
media. The IS reachability matches three times more syslog state
transitions than IP reachability and we expect syslog to reasonably
reﬂect ground truth. Therefore, even though IS reachability is blind
to 20% of physical links it is still preferable to using IP reachability
ﬁeld to detect link state changes.
At the same time, IP reachability matches 20% more physical
media state changes than IS reachability. Hence, we conclude that
IP reachability reﬂects physical media state. Therefore, IP reacha-
bility must be formed in order for IS reachability to be established,
but it is not sufﬁcient to establish IS reachability. Hence, we con-
sider state changes only from IS reachability for the remainder of
this paper.
4. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Our comparison of syslog to IS-IS is intended to be both de-
scriptive and prescriptive. Ideally, syslog would provide failure-
for-failure accounting and thus be usable for any purpose. How-
ever, in Section 4.1 we show that there is signiﬁcant disagreement
in state transitions. As a result, there is a bias in metrics having to
do with link failures. Section 4.2 shows that some statistical proper-
ties are preserved, however. Section 4.3 shows how to ﬁlter the data
to remove false positives and short failure bias in order to maximize
the utility of syslog-based analyses. Finally, in Section 4.4 we look
at a high-level metric, customer availability, as one real-world use
case.
1RFC 5305 provides an extension to the IS-IS protocol to enable
differentiation in IP networks, but it is not running on most devices
in the CENIC network.

4.1 Analyzing Link State Changes
We begin by examining the accuracy of state transitions since
it is simple and straightforward. Moreover, if such a ﬁne-grained
measure were accurate, all higher-level metrics would also be ac-
curate.
During the 13-month measurement period, our IS-IS listener
recorded 22,792 adjacency state transitions: 11,496 withdrawing
a previously advertised adjacency, and 11,296 introducing a new
adjacency. We refer to the former as a DOWN event, and the latter
as an UP event, the two events together constituting a failure.
Under ideal conditions, each link failure would manifest itself in
syslog as a pair of messages—one from each router on either end
of the link—reporting the adjacency status change (DOWN) at the
start of a failure, and another pair of messages at the end of the
failure (UP). Under less than ideal conditions, some or all of these
four messages may be lost.
Using the procedure described in Section 3.4, we attempt to
match each syslog message (generated by the router’s IS-IS pro-
cess) to an IS-IS listener-reported event. Syslog-reported IS-IS
adjacency “Down” messages are matched to DOWN events, “Up”
messages to UP events.
Table 3 shows the results of the matching. The DOWN and
UP rows show the number of IS-IS listener-reported transitions
with the number of Syslog-reported “Down” and “Up” messages
matched to each. In the None column are transitions with no match-
ing Syslog messages, in the One column are transitions where only
one router sent a matching message, and in the Both column are
transitions where both routers sent matching Syslog messages.
The majority of UP transitions are captured by syslog: only 15%
do not have a matching syslog message from either router. The ma-
jority of DOWN transitions are also matched, but a slightly larger
fraction—18%—are missed. The majority of unmatched transi-
tions, 67% for DOWN and 61% for UP, occur during periods of link
ﬂapping. Further investigation shows that than less than half of all
syslog state transitions are matched during periods of link ﬂapping.
In keeping with previous work we consider two or more consecu-
tive failures on the same link separated by less than 10 minutes part
of a ﬂapping episode [17]. We therefore conclude that syslog does
not accurately describe link state during ﬂapping.
4.2 Analyzing Link Failures
Network operators are typically concerned with metrics like link
downtime that are calculated from individual link failure events.
This is concerning because our failure reconstruction methodology
relies on a DOWN and UP state transition to make a failure. Thus
if more than 15% of DOWN as well as UP transitions do not match
IS-IS, it is possible that a syslog-based analysis might miss more
than 30% of all failures. We ﬁnd, however, that the unmatched state
transitions predominately impact syslog’s ability to capture short
failures and have limited impact on most statistical properties.
The results of performing failure reconstruction and sanitation
are presented in Table 4. Sanitization consists of removing fail-

ures that span periods when the IS-IS listener was ofﬂine as well
as manually verifying the 25 syslog failures that lasted more than
24 hours. Manual veriﬁcation primarily consists of cross-checking
failures with network trouble tickets. Since one of the primary pur-
poses of network trouble tickets is to document network events, we
can reasonably expect (very) long lasting failures to be chronicled.
While manual veriﬁcation of long failures is time consuming, it is
also critical since doing so removes 6,000 hours of spurious down-
time which is almost twice the number of actual downtime hours.
At ﬁrst glance, concern about lost syslog messages appears un-
founded since syslog reports 500 (5%) more failures than IS-IS.
However, syslog reports 934 fewer hours of downtime, 25% less
than IS-IS. Moreover, 20% of all individual failure instances (not
shown) are false positives, i.e., they do not appear in IS-IS.
Table 5 shows key statistics for the syslog failure reconstruction
technique and for IS-IS listener-reported failures. The numbers are
given in annualized form by normalizing the number of failures to
link lifetime. Here we break down the data according to whether
the link in question belongs to the network backbone (Core) or is
connected to an edge router on the customer premises (CPE). We
present results for Core and CPE links separately since their differ-
ent use, equipment types, and importance, suggests that they will
have different statistics. The median number of failures per link is
lower by about one per year in syslog-inferred data than in IS-IS
listener data in both cases.
Core failure durations are higher using syslog data—52 seconds
versus 42 seconds. With CPE links, it is the opposite. Median fail-
ure duration is 10 seconds for syslog-reconstructed failures, and 12
seconds for IS-IS listener-reported failures. This unusual reversal
of syslog-inferred and IS-IS-reported data is most evident in the
annualized link downtime. The median Core link downtime is 36

minutes per year using syslog data, and 48 minutes per year using
IS-IS listener data. On the other hand, for CPE links, IS-IS data
gives a median link downtime of 2.4 hours, compared to 1.9 hours
with syslog data.
To better illustrate these differences, Figure 1 shows the cumu-
lative failure duration distribution, the cumulative annualized link
downtime distribution, and the cumulative distribution of time be-
tween failures for CPE links.
The IS-IS and Syslog distributions of failure duration for Core
links track each other closely, with most of the differences at-
tributable to short failures (less than 10 seconds): 1-second failures
are more common in the IS-IS data, while 3-5 seconds failures are
slightly more common in syslog data.
Among CPE links, Figure 1a , the differences between the two
distributions arise in the relative frequencies of short-duration fail-
ures. Syslog-inferred failures are more frequent in the 1-4 sec-
ond range, while IS-IS listener-inferred failures are more preva-
lent in the 5-7 second range. Ultimately, syslog contains more 1-
second failures, which cause the discrepancy observed. One ex-
planation for this ﬁnding is that syslog is capturing sub-second
