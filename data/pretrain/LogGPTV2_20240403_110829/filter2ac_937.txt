title:blackhat:us-19 Bounty Operations: Best Practices and Common Pitfalls to Avoid in the First 6-12 Months
Ever want to talk to someone that runs a bug bounty program and trade best practices and horror stories? Join this panel of bounty managers for real talk on signal vs noise, ROI, interacting with bounty hunters, and all the little things they wish they'd known before learning the hard way. Panelists will share strategies for day to day operations, triage strategies and scope setting, and chat about which vulnerability types are found most often and why they still end up in production code after over a decade of advances in security tooling and secure development practices.
