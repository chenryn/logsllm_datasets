## Abstract
BGP is a hard-state protocol that uses TCP connections to reliably exchange routing state updates between neighboring BGP routers. According to the protocol, only routing changes should trigger a BGP router to generate updates; updates that do not express any routing changes are superfluous and should not occur. However, such "duplicate" BGP updates have been observed as early as 1998 and as recently as 2007. To date, no quantitative measurement has been conducted on the frequency, sources, timing, impact, or causes of these duplicates. In this paper, we address these issues through a systematic assessment of BGP duplicate updates. We first show that duplicates can negatively impact router processing loads, with routers receiving up to 86.42% duplicates during their busiest times. We then reveal that about 13% of all BGP routing updates are duplicates. Finally, through a detailed investigation of duplicate properties, we identify the major cause behind the generation of pathological duplicate BGP updates.

## 1. Introduction
BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the de facto standard for inter-domain routing on the Internet, used to exchange destination reachability information. BGP was designed as a hard-state protocol, where all BGP updates should communicate some change or addition to the most current routing information reported by the router. However, actual observations reveal that routers occasionally send BGP updates with no change to the most current routing information, sometimes even sending exact copies of the most recent update. The cause of these "duplicate" routing updates remains unexplained.

The existence of duplicate updates in BGP was first reported in 1998 by Labovitz [2], who found that the number of BGP updates observed was significantly higher than expected, with a large portion being duplicates. This was attributed to problems with specific vendor routers. The industry responded with software fixes, but in 2007, Li et al. [4] re-examined BGP dynamics and found that duplicates were still present. No one has yet determined the cause of these duplicates, nor their impact on Internet health.

In this paper, we make the following contributions:
- We provide a better understanding of the nature of duplicate generation by quantifying the amount of duplicate updates from different points on the Internet and at different times.
- We reveal the impact of duplicates on Internet health, showing that they can negatively affect instantaneous router processing loads.
- We introduce a methodology for mapping eBGP updates to their corresponding iBGP updates, which can be useful for future studies.
- Using our observations, we determine the exact cause behind duplicate generation.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Definition of Duplicates
A BGP update for prefix \( p \) sent by router \( r \) is considered a "duplicate" if all attributes in the update are identical to the most recent previous update for prefix \( p \) sent by router \( r \), and both updates belong to the same BGP session.

### 2.2 BGP Peering Topologies
BGP is used for both inter-domain (eBGP) and intra-domain (iBGP) routing. 
- **External BGP (eBGP):** Used to convey reachability information between routers in different domains. Relevant attributes include Next-hop, MED, Local-pref, and Community.
- **Internal BGP (iBGP):** Used to distribute reachability information within a domain. To avoid routing loops, iBGP originally required a full mesh, but this is not scalable. Route reflection (RR) and AS confederations relax this requirement but introduce new attributes like Cluster-list and AS-confed-sequence.
- **iBGP and eBGP Interaction:** Routers that peer with both iBGP and eBGP peers may change or remove certain attributes when forwarding reachability information.

## 3. Impact of Duplicates on Routers
We measured the impact of duplicates on Internet health. Previous studies suggested that duplicates do not significantly hinder routing efficiency [3]. However, we find that duplicates are responsible for the majority of router processing loads during their busiest times. Higher processing loads can lead to more session resets, routing loops, and packet losses [9]. We analyzed data from 90 carefully selected RouteViews/RIPE monitors, ensuring each monitor was available for the entire month of March 2009, with at most one monitor per AS.

Figure 1(a) shows the percentage of duplicate traffic during the busiest times for each of the 90 monitored ASes. For 22% (20 out of 90) of the ASes, duplicates contribute 50% or more of the update traffic during the busiest times. Figure 1(b) provides a close-up of AS1853, where 86.42% of total updates during the top 0.01% of busiest times were duplicates, with the router processing about 175,000 updates in the busiest second.

## 4. Understanding Duplicates across Time and Space
### 4.1 Are Duplicates Observed at All Times?
Figure 2(a) shows the amount of duplicates along with the total number of updates from all 90 monitors during March 2009. Duplicates are not just a rare pathological behavior. In this month alone, about 91 million out of 677 million updates were duplicates, making up 13.4% of aggregated BGP traffic.

Figure 2(b) shows the maximum, minimum, and 95% confidence intervals of % duplicates observed by different monitors for the month of March from 2002 through 2009. Table 1 summarizes the number of monitors used each year. The number of qualified monitors generally increased over time due to more ASes peering with RouteViews and RIPE.

### 4.2 Are Duplicates Observed from All Networks?
We measured the percentage of duplicates generated by different types of networks (stub, transit, tier-1) for the month of March 2009. Figure 2(c) shows that all three types of networks generate duplicates, with some variation in percentages. The large confidence interval range for tier-1s is due to the small number of data points. Minimum % duplicates were very low, while maximum % duplicates were high, indicating significant variation even among networks of the same type.

### 4.3 Where Do Duplicates Originate?
To determine the origin of duplicates, we hypothesized that a duplicate message must be generated by the AS where it is observed, not by an upstream AS. We verified this by examining duplicates for specific prefixes where the observed duplicate from AS X had an AS-path ending with X-Y, and we had monitors for both AS X and AS Y. This allowed us to confirm whether duplicates originated at AS X or were propagated from AS Y.

## 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we systematically assessed the occurrence of duplicate BGP updates, revealing their significant impact on router processing loads and their prevalence across the Internet. We also provided a methodology for mapping eBGP to iBGP updates and identified the major cause behind duplicate generation. Our findings highlight the need for further research and potential improvements in BGP implementations to mitigate the negative effects of duplicate updates.
