Question: An application has recently been updated, and during the process, a user was inadvertently assigned to an administrative group instead of their standard user group. This change went unnoticed during the audit. Which of the following consequences might occur due to this misplacement?
"A": "The user may be unable to perform any actions, leading to a denial of service for that user.",
"B": "The user may be able to access resources or perform actions that are outside of their intended permissions, potentially bypassing security policies.",
"C": "The user's account may automatically be disabled due to inconsistent group membership, ensuring security.",
"D": "The application's performance might degrade due to the increased number of users in the administrative group."
Answer: B
