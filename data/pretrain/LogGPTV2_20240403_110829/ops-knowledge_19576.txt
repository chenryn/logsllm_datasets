User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk is tracking the total interrupts, time spent in the rbs signal handler, and correctable ddr errors. It also records the CE sym, address, and mask for various events. The log shows that there were no critical input interrupts and no microseconds spent on critical input interrupts. There were also no microseconds spent in the rbs signal handler during any calls. The log also records various CE sym, address, and mask for different events.
