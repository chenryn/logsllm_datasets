Hi,  
in my system configuration windows 7,32 bit.
I have installed deno on my machine using this command
`iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex`
My pwershell version is 5.1
I got this error.
`Program 'deno.exe' failed to run: The specified executable is not a valid
application for this OS platform.At line:1`
How can i fix this pblm.Please advice me,
Thanks & regards,
