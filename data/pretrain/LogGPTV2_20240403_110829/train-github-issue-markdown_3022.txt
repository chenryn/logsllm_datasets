Subject: Issue with Deno Installation on Windows 7 (32-bit)

Hi,

I am currently using a Windows 7, 32-bit system and have attempted to install Deno by running the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

My PowerShell version is 5.1.

However, I encountered the following error message:

```
Program 'deno.exe' failed to run: The specified executable is not a valid application for this OS platform.
At line:1
```

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Anitha G.
