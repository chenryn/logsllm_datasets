ABSTRACT
The Locator/Identiﬁer Separation Protocol (LISP) in-
troduces several beneﬁts to the Internet architecture,
yet, since it is just in the initial deployment stage, com-
prehensive understanding of its integration performance
with legacy Internet becomes essential. We leverage
RIPE Atlas, the largest Internet measurement infras-
tructure, to conduct large scale measurements analysis
to provide the feedback to improve LISP technology.
The preliminary evaluations show that LISP generally
has a reliable performance, compared with the exist-
ing Internet. From our vantage point, we observe that
LISP introduces a non-negligible latency for the Eu-
ropean and North American destinations, occasionally
some extremely large delay, however, it shows a faster
connection for the Asian intercontinental transmission.

INTRODUCTION
Aiming at resolving the scalability issue of the In-
ternet Architecture, the Locator/Identiﬁer Separation
Protocol (LISP) has been proposed and currently under
standardization at the IETF [3]. The key point of LISP
is to separate the current IP address into two spaces:
end-point identiﬁer and topological locator. Then a
map-and-encap mechanism is introduced to guarantee
the end-to-end communication. With the help of such

philosophy, LISP brings not only the scalability im-
provement, but also enables support for VM mobility
in Data Centers, easy IPv6 transition, and allows en-
hanced inter-domain traﬃc engineering [5].
To promote the deployment of LISP and explore its
behavior, the LISP-Lab research platform has been re-
cently deployed. As this large scale ﬂexible platform is
in an early stage, it is essential to evaluate the real world
performance when it integrates with the legacy Internet
so to improve LISP-Lab performance itself and provide
the feedback to lead the LISP technology development.
To this aim, and to obtain a realistic LISP experience,
we leverage RIPE Atlas [2] measurement infrastructure
to conduct large scale experiments. Since the latter is
the largest existing Internet measurement infrastructure
providing wide information on the Internet condition, it
ﬁts perfectly our requirements.
2. ASSESSING LISP WITH RIPE ATLAS
LISP achieves address role separation by splitting the
semantics of IP addresses into two categories: Rout-
ing LOCators (RLOCs) used in the core Internet and
the Endpoint IDentiﬁers (EIDs) used in stub networks.
Communications within stub networks (intra-domain)
do conventional routing and forwarding by using EIDs,
while inter-domain communications need an additional
map-and-encap operation, i.e., need to encapsulate pack-
ets using EID addresses into packets using RLOC ad-
dresses, hence mapping EID to RLOCs.
Internetworking between LISP and non-LISP networks
is realized via a new network element: the PxTR. The
acronym indicates two types of proxies [4]: Proxy Ingress
Tunnel Routers (PITRs) and Proxy Egress Tunnel Rou-
ters (PETRs). PITRs advertise highly aggregated EID-
Preﬁxes on behalf of LISP sites so that non-LISP sites
can reach them. They also encapsulate non-LISP traf-
ﬁc into LISP packets with their own RLOCs and route
them towards their destination RLOCs. PETRs allow
LISP sites to send packets to non-LISP sites. In par-
ticular, PETRs decapsulate the LISP packets received
from LISP-sites to conventional IP packets and forward
them in the legacy Internet. By using such proxy ap-
proach, a stretch in the path is introduced, thus the
evaluation of its impact is of prime importance.

The goal of our measurements is to fully understand
the LISP interworking behavior with legacy Internet.
Since the RIPE Atlas infrastructure is a global network
of thousands of active probes, providing ping, tracer-
oute, DNS, SSL and HTTP functions to measure Inter-
net’s connectivity and reachability, we deployed a probe
(#22341) on the LISP-Lab platform in Paris, France.
This allows us to conduct the LISP-enabled active mea-
surements.
To ensure comprehensiveness and accuracy four other
probes geographically close to our probe are selected:
rmd (#16958), mPlane (#13842), FranceIX (#6118).
The probe rmd allows to compare the performance of
non-LISP and non-academic networks, while the probe
mPlane is selected to compare the performance of non-
LISP but academic networks. As an anchor (i.e., an
enhanced probe), FranceIX is used as a reference. The
destinations are selected from the Alexa [1] ranking,
which oﬀers the 500 most popular websites. Our plan
is to launch very large scale measurements according to
the probes we selected as well as the Alexa’s top sites.
3. PRELIMINARY EVALUATION
We are still in the setup phase, scripting all opera-
tions so to have an automated measurement tool. We
started with the 4 selected probes ping to a limited
number of destinations (top 50 Alexa sites). The ex-
perimental time span is 6 hours with an interval of 10
minutes. The preliminary results are obtained by as-
sessing the round-trip time (RTT) performances.
Fig. 1 depicts the percentage of times that one probe’s
RTT is the smallest compared to three other probes
grouped by continents where the selected targets are lo-
cated. When the destinations are in Europe and Amer-
ica, FranceIX is the fastest most of the time. This
is reasonable, since FranceIX is an Internet Exchange
Point (IXP), acting as Atlas’ anchor, thus it is well con-
nected with a more powerful hardware. Whereas, the
percentage of LISP-Lab is always 0. Its higher RTT is
caused by the proxy stretch, since traﬃc between LISP-
Lab probe and the legacy Internet has to pass through
the LISP-Lab PxTR, which is in Lyon (approx. 400km
away from the probe). When the targets are in Asia,
LISP-Lab becomes the fastest with a percentage of 20%
(mean RTT) and 10% (median RTT). It indicates that
s‘uch connection from the LISP-Lab PxTR is faster, so
that the stretch can be ignored. The performance of
FranceIX is not very stable to the Asian destinations,
being the fastest 0% in average, but it is 10% looking
at the median RTT. It shows that FranceIX sometimes
has extremely high RTT values to Asian destinations.
We also evaluate whether the performance of LISP-
Lab is as stable as FranceIX. We deﬁne the relative
performance for each destination as: RT TLISP−Lab -
RT TF ranceIX , and the results clustered by continents
are shown in Fig. 2. The left one shows the mean RTT,
while the right one shows the median RTT. For the
European and American targets, LISP-Lab is a little
slower than FranceIX but with a stable behavior. On
the contrary, for half of the Asian destinations, LISP-
Lab is signiﬁcantly faster than FranceIX. It shows that
the network connection between LISP-Lab PxTR and
Asian destinations has better performance. Comparing
the two subﬁgures, there is no negative values at all in
Europe and America area in left ﬁgure, but there are
some in the right one. It indicates that LISP-Lab RTTs
to these destinations are very unstable and the variance
is quite high.
4. ONGOING AND FUTURE WORK
We are currently working on an experiment spanning
more than one week so that the periodicity of LISP-Lab
integration performance via RIPE Atlas can by ana-
lyzed. Furthermore, we aim at using richer set of ob-
served parameters, including traceroute, which because
of the encapsulation does not natively work with LISP.
Finally, we plan to expand the experiment scale covering
all the sites ranked in Alexa to get more comprehensive
results to further understand the advantages of LISP.
