I often open Atom, then hit `âŒ˜ + O` to open a file or source directory. The
annoyance I have though, is that Atom now has two windows open, one that has
the directory I just opened, but also the one that was opened when Atom was
opened, which is an empty window.
It would be nice if Atom was smart enough to realize that the first window
that was opened is not useful if blank, and replaces it with the window I just
opened, rather than adding a new window.
The reason this is annoying is that when I click Atom on the dock, it brings
up both windows, which is suboptimal when switching between different programs
running.
