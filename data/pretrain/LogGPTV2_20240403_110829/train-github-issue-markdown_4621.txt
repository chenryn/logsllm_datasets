To integrate SendPulse into your Next.js page, you can follow these steps. I've also included a more professional and clear version of the additional text you provided.

### Integrating SendPulse in a Next.js Page

1. **Add the SendPulse Script to Your Project:**
   - First, ensure that you have the necessary SendPulse script. This is typically provided by SendPulse when you set up your account or create a new campaign.
   - You can add the script to your Next.js project by placing it in the `public` directory or by using a package manager like npm if SendPulse provides an npm package.

2. **Create a Custom Script Component:**
   - Create a new React component to handle the script. This will help keep your code organized and reusable.

   ```jsx
   // components/SendPulseScript.js
   import React from 'react';

   const SendPulseScript = () => {
     return (
       <script
         src="YOUR_SENDPULSE_SCRIPT_URL"
         type="text/javascript"
         async
         defer
       ></script>
     );
   };

   export default SendPulseScript;
   ```

3. **Include the Script in Your Next.js Layout:**
   - Add the `SendPulseScript` component to your layout or any specific page where you want to use SendPulse.

   ```jsx
   // pages/_app.js
   import '../styles/globals.css';
   import SendPulseScript from '../components/SendPulseScript';

   function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
     return (
       <>
         <SendPulseScript />
         <Component {...pageProps} />
       </>
     );
   }

   export default MyApp;
   ```

4. **Verify the Integration:**
   - After adding the script, test your Next.js application to ensure that SendPulse is working correctly. You can do this by checking for any errors in the browser console and verifying that the expected functionality (e.g., form submissions, email tracking) is functioning as intended.
