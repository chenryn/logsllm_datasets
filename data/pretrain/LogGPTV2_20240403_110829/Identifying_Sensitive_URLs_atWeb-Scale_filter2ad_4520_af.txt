sensitive URL. Looking at this set of domains and URLs we notice
questionable practices such using HTTP instead of HTTPS, and we
detect lots of persistent and third-party cookies.
In our future work we intend to analyses the identity and the
methods used by third-parties on the more than 155 million sensi-
tive URLs that we have detected. We also intend to design efficient
white-/black-listing methods to avoid having to perform per-URL
classification. Our initial results indicate that performing this at
domain level would create lots of false positives and negatives, since
many sensitive URLs are under top-level domains that seem non-
sensitive (and vice versa). We also intend to examine crowdsourced
approaches and federated learning techniques for distributing both
the collection of (re)training sets and the (re)execution of training
algorithms.

Identifying Sensitive URLs at Web-Scale
IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
APPENDIX
A EXTRACTING SENSITIVE URLS FROM
UNKNOWN ELEMENTS
In order to include more samples in each category we first classify
all the Unknown elements using the baseline classifier. Since the
overall number of categories in our classifier is six, the minimum
prediction probability needed in order to assign a class for a given
URL is ≈ 0.17, assuming that the URL content is diverse enough to
cover all the categories. Nevertheless, if a given URL shows biases
towards only two classes the prediction probability can climb up to
0.5. In order to avoid polluting our dataset with mis-classified URLs
we set a minimum threshold on the prediction probability for all
sensitive categories to be above 0.5. Note that during our analysis
the lower prediction probability that we observe for the sensitive
categories was equal among all of them at ≈ 0.3.
In the case of the Non-sensitive category, we include the top
157,118 URLs to balance the ratio between sensitive and non-sensitive
URLs based on their prediction probability. In this case, since the
number of URLs belonging to the Non-sensitive category is bounded
by the total number of URLs that we need for balancing the ratio be-
tween sensitive and non-sensitive, the lower prediction probability
that we observe for the included URLs was 0.97.
The second column of Table 6 reports the new elements that are
added to each category. Despite our attempt to keep the categories
balanced, we were unable to achieve an equal split among the five
sensitive categories. On one side, for extremely generic categories
such as Ethnicity, we had hard times finding those elements even
in our manually validated ground truth. On the other side, Curlie is
a community-driven project focused on detecting a wide range of
different topics, it might simply lack samples for specific categories
(e.g., Sexual Orientation). The column łFinalž shows the overall
number of URLs that were included in this expanded version of our
training dataset that we use to build the balanced classifier.
To confirm that the samples that were added to each category are
correctly classified, we sampled 100 elements from each category
and manually validated the categorization. Our investigation shows
that more than 90% of the elements were correctly labeled.
