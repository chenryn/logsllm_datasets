Deno provides a lot of useful objects in the runtime. It is also great to see
a project that is solving many of the security problems of running JavaScript.
I'd like to lock things down even further so that I can use Deno for hermetic
config generation.
Are there plans to offer something like the vm module available in node or
some other way to provide a smaller environment (i.e. no Deno.pid etc etc)?
