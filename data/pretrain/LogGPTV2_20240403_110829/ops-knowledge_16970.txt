User: I have an account on a supercomputing cluster where I've installed some packages using e.g. "pip install --user keras".
When using qsub to submit jobs to the queue, I try to make sure the system can see my local packages by setting "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:[$HOME]/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras" in the script.
However, the resulting log file still complains that there is no package called keras. How can I make sure the system finds my packages?
Assistant: If you are using pbs professional then try to export PYTHONPATH in your environment and then submit job using "-V" option with qsub. This will make qsub take all of your environment variables and export it for the job.
Else, try setting it using option "-v" (notice small v) and then put your environment variable key/value pair with that option like qsub -v HOME=/home/user job.sh
