interoperability funding does not appear to be a priority (e.g., communications equipment is procured largely based on 
agency-specific needs).  Leaders within the City of Chicago and Cook County have been independently very supportive 
of the communications interoperability issue (e.g., Cook County is developing a shared system supporting numerous 
municipalities), but could still continue efforts to come together at the leadership level to actively pursue regionwide 
communications interoperability. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue progress toward a unified governance structure (city and county) 
• 
Establish a charter for the unified working group and implement a regular meeting schedule to actively work issues 
to improve regional (tactical and strategic) interoperability 
• 
Document and formalize agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all participating agencies to 
support partnerships on regional interoperability and allocate resources to implement them 
• 
Establish a regular review process for agreements to ensure that they remain current and relevant 
• 
Develop and document a consensus regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance, and align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that 
regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term interoperability planning and sustainable funding (beyond 
funding for individual jurisdictions and their systems) 
• 
Encourage regional funding alternatives and sources in addition to grants 
• 
Identify a champion(s) to establish a governance structure that more fully supports a regional strategic plan and 
involve senior government leadership broadly across the area in interoperability

through a TICP workshop, but not in any broader manner that would ensure awareness and understanding of the 
procedures.  This lack of awareness of SOPs was evident during the exercise (e.g., lack of familiarity with the radio 
cache procedures).  The UA is in the process of implementing the National Incident Management System 
(NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS), and is currently undergoing a significant training effort to take steps toward 
NIMS/ICS compliance and SOP adoption.  The State has certified the City as moving toward its 2006 goals for NIMS 
compliance.  The UA demonstrated success with ICS command and control during the TICP validation exercise with 
limited problems (e.g., incorrect use of ICS forms, Communication Unit Leader procedural oversights). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Develop regional interoperability SOPs consistent with the TICP, disseminate them throughout the UA, and train 
all participating agencies 
• 
Identify the title and source documentation for existing SOPs in the TICP  
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit implementation 
consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS 
compliance

To address a fragmented regional communications infrastructure in which there are insufficient communication 
channels for joint operations within the City of Chicago, UA first responders use a number of methods to achieve 
communications interoperability.  The UA successfully demonstrated the use of cached radios, which provided effective 
communications with the federal agencies (i.e., the Federal Bureau of Investigation).  This interoperable solution 
(through the Mutual Aid Box Alarm System) has also been used in various real world circumstances to provide 
interoperability among command personnel across the City and surrounding municipalities.  Chicago officials indicated 
that responders often used commercial devices to communicate, for which there were no established TICP procedures, 
which is problematic for establishing interoperable communications during a multi-agency incident response.  During 
the TICP validation exercise, gateway use was problematic.  Considering that the gateway was one of two means of 
interoperability between the County and the City, ineffective use of it could challenge multijurisdictional 
communications.  As reflected in the TICP validation exercise, the lack of available channels to share between agencies 
during an incident could impact the effective management and resolution of communications.  Additionally, specific 
TICP usage procedures were not observed (e.g., extra charged batteries for extended radio deployment, ensuring 
qualified technicians were available for on-scene support, and properly labeled radios with the owning agency and 
frequency band) likely due to the limited nature (e.g., incident command level only) of the exercise.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources regularly to improve proficiency (e.g., mobile 
gateway systems) 
• 
Practice multijurisdictional and multidisciplinary communications during future exercises and day-to-day activities 
• 
Consider reviewing current interoperable communications equipment and infrastructure to determine whether 
existing systems and/or technology is sufficient to support regionwide interoperability

Technology Overview    
The City of Chicago uses both ultra high frequency and very high frequency (VHF) systems.  Cook County uses a VHF 
and 800 megahertz system.  There is no existing shared system for the city and county jurisdictions.  Shared channels 
are available for interoperability but are not typically used.  When city personnel operate in the suburbs, they use 
regional shared channels, while responders coming into the city are often provided with cached radios.  Chicago and 
Cook County are working together to develop a plan for future radio interoperability communications for the entire 
Chicago area, which will benefit both jurisdictions.  By the end of 2006 the Federal Government will have a two-
channel shared radio system in place that will cover the five counties that represent the Greater Chicago Area.

The Indianapolis UA is working toward establishing communications interoperability as a priority in the UA.  
The UA established the Interoperability Subcommittee in April 2005 for the development of the Tactical 
Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), as well as for overall communications coordination.  While the 
TICP has been a positive step in establishing the governance group, the group does not appear to be 
formalized through a charter that describes its authority or the overall governance structure.  However, the 
UA does report that an interoperability strategic plan is in place and has been accepted by participating 
agencies. Formal agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding [MOU]) establishing roles and 
responsibilities of partner agencies in the UA for interoperability are not currently established.  The 
jurisdictions have been successful in securing funding from federal grants as well as local sources, but there 
is no long-term funding strategy in place to pay for recurring costs for interoperable solutions.  Additionally, 
individual organizations develop and maintain their own budgets and procure interoperable communications 
equipment based on agency-specific needs. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Establish a charter to encourage formal membership in the decision-making group (including all 
necessary first responder agencies) 
• 
Document and formalize the necessary agreements (e.g., MOU) including local, state, and federal 
agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability, and reference all applicable agreements in 
the TICP and store them in an accessible format 
• 
Establish and clearly distinguish the strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP), and 
update it annually and after system upgrades and events that test capabilities 
• 
Encourage a regional interoperability funding strategy, including long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding 
sources that address both counties in the Indianapolis UA; this funding strategy should address capital 
and recurring costs 
• 
Establish a direct relationship between the Interoperability Subcommittee and political and fiscal leaders 
at the local and state level to advocate for achieving goals outlined in the strategic plan

The development of the TICP used the two counties’ policies and procedures as a foundation, providing the 
UA’s first set of coordinated regional communications interoperability SOPs.  The TICP will be expanded 
and more broadly distributed during the first quarter of 2007 to include additional regions within the state.  
Since its completion, the UA has taken steps (e.g., distributed through the TICP Implementation Workshop, 
make gateway SOPs available with gateways) to disseminate these newly developed, regional SOPs.  During 
the TICP validation exercise, TICP policies and procedures for radio cache activation and deactivation were

followed.  However, despite the overall success of the exercise, some activation procedures were not used 
(e.g., participants did not clear the shared channel before activating a console patch).  The Indianapolis UA 
has been implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Management System 
(ICS) for more than 1 year, and the Communications Unit Leader position was used effectively during the 
exercise.  During the exercise, the Incident Commander was clearly identified, and a command post was set 
up.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Distribute SOPs to include all participating agencies and dispatchers 
• 
Update the TICP to reflect regionwide operational communications procedures 
• 
Ensure that regional SOPs are aligned with statewide planning efforts 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

Multi-agency communications within the area (specifically Hamilton and Marion counties) occur on a daily 
basis.  The existing systems (e.g., 800 megahertz [MHz]) use different proprietary technologies, and, as a 
result, gateways are used on a regular basis and are tested weekly.  These methods, as well as shared 
channels and a radio cache, were used effectively during the TICP validation exercise.  For example, 
interoperable communications were established between Metropolitan Emergency Communications Agency 
(MECA) and Hamilton County using a gateway.  Although the Indianapolis UA showed success across local 
agencies involved in the exercise, additional state, federal, and public support agencies were not included to 
the maximum extent possible in this event; their involvement in future exercises would help demonstrate 
broader interoperability across disciplines and levels of government.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider expanding exercises to involve private, state, and federal agencies to ensure consistency of how 
to apply interoperable communications 
• 
Consider adding interoperability as a component for all future exercises

provided by Hamilton County.  All agencies in Hamilton and Marion counties are interoperable with each other and use 
the National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) channels.  In addition, console patches and/or 
gateways will also be used for interoperability.  The UA will continue to use the NPSPAC channels, console patches, 
and gateways to achieve interoperability between the two counties.

The Louisville UA’s governance group is the Communications Committee (within the Urban Area Working 
Group), which has been active and successful primarily in the development of its regional gateway system.  
The success of this group has been evident in the grant and local funding that has been devoted to the 
MetroSafe effort.  With the development of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), the 
group formalized its preexisting agreements and SOPs by establishing charters.  The work of the governance 
group, both in its tactical and strategic planning efforts, appears heavily focused on the core city/county, but 
did not incorporate all counties included in the UA.  At the state level, the Kentucky Wireless 
Interoperability Executive Committee was established to coordinate and make recommendations regarding 
policy, training, exercises, compliance, establishment of special committees, and operational issues within 
the Commonwealth.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Clarify whether published and active partnerships exist for all counties (i.e., Washington County) 
• 
Work to develop a regional strategic plan that has political and financial support throughout the area 
• 
Coordinate with all necessary participants across the area and work jointly toward development  of 
interoperable communications capabilities consistent with the regional strategic plan

Agencies in the Louisville UA have had communications interoperability policies and procedures in place for 
a number of years.  Prior to the TICP, these SOPs were captured in a compilation document.  Since the 
development of regional SOPs through the TICP, the UA has taken a number of steps to disseminate this 
information to all agencies (e.g., gateways SOPs available with gateways, distributed through TICP 
Implementation Workshop).  The UA has been implementing National Incident Management System 
(NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) for more than 1 year, which indicates that the agencies have spent 
some time aligning their prior command and control procedures to be NIMS compliant.  Agencies 
participating in the TICP validation exercise used the NIMS/ICS and the Communications Unit Leader 
(COML) with some issues (e.g., the COML was not formally identified) that should be addressed as 
additional training becomes available.  These gaps in SOP implementation are likely due to the fact that the 
exercise (“Thunder Over Louisville”) represented the first time the entire NIMS/ICS was used across all first 
responder agencies.

The Louisville UA has been successful in the use of its gateway system to provide multi-agency and 
multijurisdictional communications in the Louisville/Jefferson County area.  This solution has allowed the 
UA to provide shared communications across multiple existing systems and frequency bands.  The 
documentation did not note to what extent this system is currently providing interoperability to the UA 
(including the four Indiana counties), and if it is not, how communications interoperability is achieved.  This 
concern about regular usage with these counties was reinforced by the lack of representation from these 
counties in the TICP validation exercise (e.g., Jefferson County was the only county included).  The exercise 
showed difficulty using shared channels and radios caches.  In addition, there are concerns (similar to both 
the TICP Peer Review recommendations and the exercise evaluator comments) that the UA relied too heavily 
on the gateway system.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Test and exercise the activation procedures for radio caches  
• 
Because previous reviews noted concern in potential overloading of channels connected by fixed 
gateway system, ensure that only priority staff use the fixed gateway solution in situations where there is 
potential for overloading 
• 
Begin planning for training and exercise plans for forthcoming standards-based shared system 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Agencies within Jefferson County (Louisville UA) use a mixture of very high frequency (VHF) low band, VHF High 
Band, ultra high frequency (UHF) and 800 megahertz (MHz) conventional radio systems.  Metrosafe, Louisville's 
designation for radio communications interoperability, uses an audio bridge (Motorola MotoBridge™) to patch together 
most urban police and fire agencies with suburban police and fire agencies. 
Louisville Metrosafe is continuing the development of a radio infrastructure with the capacity to provide seamless 
communications interoperability for multiple public safety and public service organizations within Jefferson County and 
its surrounding UA. The technology that has been chosen will be Project 25-compliant in a trunked, simulcast, 
narrowband configured, 700/800 MHz radio system.  The goal is to cover Jefferson County and an area 3 miles beyond 
the county line with signal coverage capable of supporting handheld radios carried at the hip-level.  This new radio 
infrastructure is meant to address challenges resulting from two different interoperability efforts between the City of 
Louisville and Jefferson County.  In January 2003, the City of Louisville and Jefferson County began coordinating their 
interoperability efforts to address these challenges including antiquated technology and discipline specific 
communications centers with different/marginal funding streams.
