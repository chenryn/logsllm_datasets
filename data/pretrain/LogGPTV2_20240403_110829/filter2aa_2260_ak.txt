### Interoperability Funding and Governance

Interoperability funding is not a priority, as communication equipment procurement is largely based on individual agency needs. Despite this, leaders in the City of Chicago and Cook County have shown strong support for communication interoperability. For instance, Cook County is developing a shared system that supports multiple municipalities. However, there is still a need for more coordinated efforts at the leadership level to achieve regionwide communications interoperability.

#### Recommendations:
- **Unified Governance Structure:** Continue progress toward a unified governance structure for both the city and county.
- **Charter and Regular Meetings:** Establish a charter for the unified working group and implement a regular meeting schedule to address and improve regional (tactical and strategic) interoperability.
- **Formal Agreements:** Document and formalize agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all participating agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability and allocate resources for their implementation.
- **Review Process:** Establish a regular review process for these agreements to ensure they remain current and relevant.
- **Strategic Plan:** Develop and document a consensus regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance. Align local and state strategic planning efforts to meet regional interoperability needs.
- **Long-Term Planning and Funding:** Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term interoperability planning and sustainable funding, extending beyond funding for individual jurisdictions and their systems.
- **Funding Alternatives:** Encourage regional funding alternatives and sources in addition to grants.
- **Champion and Involvement:** Identify a champion(s) to establish a governance structure that fully supports a regional strategic plan and involves senior government leadership across the area in interoperability.

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Intermediate Implementation

The Chicago Urban Area (UA) has taken advantage of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) effort to begin formalizing its communications interoperability policies, practices, and procedures for the first time. While the area has disseminated SOPs through a TICP workshop, broader awareness and understanding are lacking. This was evident during an exercise where participants were unfamiliar with radio cache procedures. The UA is currently implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) and undergoing significant training to achieve NIMS/ICS compliance. The state has certified the city as moving toward its 2006 goals for NIMS compliance. During the TICP validation exercise, the UA demonstrated success with ICS command and control, though minor issues were noted (e.g., incorrect use of ICS forms, procedural oversights by the Communication Unit Leader).

#### Recommendations:
- **Regional SOPs:** Develop regional interoperability SOPs consistent with the TICP, disseminate them throughout the UA, and train all participating agencies.
- **Documentation:** Identify and document existing SOPs in the TICP.
- **Training and Exercises:** Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs, including communications unit implementation, to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

### Usage: Intermediate Implementation

To address the fragmented regional communications infrastructure, UA first responders use various methods to achieve interoperability. The UA successfully demonstrated the use of cached radios, which provided effective communication with federal agencies (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Investigation). This solution has also been used in real-world scenarios to provide interoperability among command personnel across the city and surrounding municipalities. However, responders often use commercial devices for communication, for which there are no established TICP procedures, posing a challenge for multi-agency incident response. During the TICP validation exercise, gateway use was problematic, and the lack of available channels impacted effective communication management.

#### Recommendations:
- **Regular Testing:** Test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources regularly to improve proficiency (e.g., mobile gateway systems).
- **Multijurisdictional Practice:** Practice multijurisdictional and multidisciplinary communications during future exercises and day-to-day activities.
- **Technology Review:** Consider reviewing current interoperable communications equipment and infrastructure to determine if existing systems and technology are sufficient for regionwide interoperability.

### Technology Overview

The City of Chicago uses both ultra-high frequency (UHF) and very high frequency (VHF) systems, while Cook County uses VHF and 800 MHz systems. There is no shared system between the city and county, although shared channels are available but not typically used. When city personnel operate in the suburbs, they use regional shared channels, and responders coming into the city are often provided with cached radios. Chicago and Cook County are collaborating to develop a plan for future radio interoperability communications for the entire Chicago area. By the end of 2006, the Federal Government will have a two-channel shared radio system in place covering the five counties in the Greater Chicago Area.

### Indianapolis, IN: Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

#### Governance: Intermediate Implementation

The Indianapolis UA is working toward establishing communications interoperability as a priority. The Interoperability Subcommittee, established in April 2005, has developed the TICP and coordinates overall communications. While the TICP is a positive step, the group lacks a formal charter. An interoperability strategic plan is in place and accepted by participating agencies, but formal agreements (e.g., MOUs) are not yet established. Funding comes from federal grants and local sources, but there is no long-term strategy for recurring costs. Individual organizations procure equipment based on specific needs.

#### Recommendations:
- **Formal Membership:** Establish a charter to encourage formal membership in the decision-making group, including all necessary first responder agencies.
- **Formal Agreements:** Document and formalize necessary agreements (e.g., MOUs) involving local, state, and federal agencies, and reference them in the TICP.
- **Strategic Plan:** Establish and clearly distinguish the strategic plan, updating it annually and after system upgrades and events.
- **Funding Strategy:** Encourage a regional interoperability funding strategy, including long-term (3 to 5 years) funding sources for both counties in the Indianapolis UA.
- **Political and Fiscal Leaders:** Establish a direct relationship between the Interoperability Subcommittee and political and fiscal leaders at the local and state levels to advocate for achieving the strategic plan's goals.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Established Implementation

The TICP development used the two counties' policies and procedures as a foundation, providing the UA's first set of coordinated regional communications interoperability SOPs. The TICP will be expanded and more broadly distributed in early 2007. The UA has taken steps to disseminate these SOPs, and during the TICP validation exercise, policies and procedures for radio cache activation and deactivation were followed, though some activation procedures were not used. The Indianapolis UA has been implementing NIMS/ICS for over a year, and the Communications Unit Leader position was effectively used during the exercise.

#### Recommendations:
- **SOP Distribution:** Distribute SOPs to include all participating agencies and dispatchers.
- **Update TICP:** Update the TICP to reflect regionwide operational communications procedures.
- **Alignment with Statewide Efforts:** Ensure that regional SOPs are aligned with statewide planning efforts.
- **Training and Exercises:** Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Established Implementation

Multi-agency communications within the area (specifically Hamilton and Marion counties) occur daily. Existing systems (e.g., 800 MHz) use different proprietary technologies, and gateways are used and tested weekly. These methods, along with shared channels and a radio cache, were used effectively during the TICP validation exercise. However, additional state, federal, and public support agencies were not fully included, and their involvement in future exercises would help demonstrate broader interoperability.

#### Recommendations:
- **Expand Exercises:** Consider expanding exercises to involve private, state, and federal agencies to ensure consistency in applying interoperable communications.
- **Interoperability Component:** Consider adding interoperability as a component for all future exercises.

### Technology Overview

All public safety and public service agencies in Marion County use an 800 MHz Motorola radio system provided by the Metropolitan Emergency Communications Agency (MECA). Public safety and public service agencies in Hamilton County use an 800 MHz M/A-COM radio system provided by Hamilton County. All agencies in both counties are interoperable and use the National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) channels. Console patches and/or gateways are also used for interoperability. The UA will continue to use NPSPAC channels, console patches, and gateways to achieve interoperability between the two counties.

### Louisville, KY: Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Established Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Intermediate Implementation

#### Governance: Established Implementation

The Louisville UA’s governance group, the Communications Committee, has been active and successful, particularly in developing the regional gateway system. The TICP formalized preexisting agreements and SOPs, and the group's work has focused on the core city/county, but not all counties in the UA. At the state level, the Kentucky Wireless Interoperability Executive Committee coordinates and makes recommendations on policy, training, exercises, compliance, and operational issues.

#### Recommendations:
- **Partnerships:** Clarify whether published and active partnerships exist for all counties (e.g., Washington County).
- **Regional Strategic Plan:** Work to develop a regional strategic plan with political and financial support throughout the area.
- **Coordination:** Coordinate with all necessary participants across the area and work jointly toward developing interoperable communications capabilities consistent with the regional strategic plan.
- **Governance Structure:** Review and champion a governance structure that fully supports a regional strategic plan encompassing the entire UA.
- **Leadership Participation:** Expand leadership participation to include representation across the area.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Established Implementation

Agencies in the Louisville UA have had communications interoperability policies and procedures in place for several years. The TICP compiled these SOPs, and the UA has taken steps to disseminate this information to all agencies. The UA has been implementing NIMS/ICS for over a year, aligning prior command and control procedures with NIMS. During the TICP validation exercise, participating agencies used NIMS/ICS and the Communications Unit Leader (COML) with some issues (e.g., the COML was not formally identified), which should be addressed with additional training.

#### Recommendations:
- **SOP Incorporation:** Ensure all regional communications interoperability SOPs are incorporated into the TICP and distributed to participating agencies outside of Jefferson County.
- **Practice SOPs:** Regularly practice SOPs to increase proficiency in their use (e.g., minimize use of patched channels to maximize channel resources).
- **Training and Exercises:** Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs to ensure all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Intermediate Implementation

The Louisville UA has been successful in using its gateway system to provide multi-agency and multijurisdictional communications in the Louisville/Jefferson County area. This solution allows for shared communications across multiple existing systems and frequency bands. However, documentation does not specify the extent to which this system provides interoperability to the entire UA, including the four Indiana counties. The TICP validation exercise showed difficulty using shared channels and radio caches, and previous reviews have noted concerns about potential overloading of channels connected by the fixed gateway system.

#### Recommendations:
- **Activation Procedures:** Test and exercise the activation procedures for radio caches.
- **Channel Overloading:** Ensure that only priority staff use the fixed gateway solution in situations where there is potential for overloading.
- **Training and Exercise Plans:** Begin planning for training and exercise plans for the forthcoming standards-based shared system.
- **Interoperability Component:** Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

### Technology Overview

Agencies within Jefferson County (Louisville UA) use a mixture of VHF low band, VHF High Band, UHF, and 800 MHz conventional radio systems. Metrosafe, Louisville's designation for radio communications interoperability, uses an audio bridge (Motorola MotoBridge™) to patch together urban police and fire agencies with suburban agencies. Metrosafe is developing a radio infrastructure with the capacity to provide seamless communications interoperability for multiple public safety and public service organizations within Jefferson County and its surrounding UA. The chosen technology will be Project 25-compliant in a trunked, simulcast, narrowband configured, 700/800 MHz radio system. The goal is to cover Jefferson County and an area 3 miles beyond the county line with signal coverage capable of supporting handheld radios carried at hip-level. This new radio infrastructure aims to address challenges resulting from two different interoperability efforts between the City of Louisville and Jefferson County, which began coordinating their efforts in January 2003.
