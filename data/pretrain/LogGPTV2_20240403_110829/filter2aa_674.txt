 Pre-installed Kali Linux 
 Prefer to have it as the main OS, not virtualized 
 CAT5 cable of sufficient length 
 We didn’t know in advance how the rooms would 
be, so please bear with us when we get everyone 
connected 
 Patience 
 4 hours, 4 tasks, a LOT of network congestion 
 This is a HOSTILE NETWORK!!

 Do / Don’t 
 Everyone is here to learn, so don’t impede others 
 Embrace other people’s genius 
 Workshop = Group Effort, work as a team 
 Workshop != Taking over someone else’s keyboard 
 We’re here to learn, not be pedantic over terms

 Overflow it, and have no mercy! 
 When CAM table fills up, it pushes all data out all 
ports* 
 Essentially, you turn a Switch (L2) into a Hub (L1) 
 #macof -C to stop 
the attack 
 Remote internal pentests are a PAIN!! RDP stops 
working when you use ettercap (hint: “timeout”) 
 Start slow – you can impact production 
 When conducting a pentest, make sure you’re in a 
valid employee subnet 
 READ THE PCAP FILE – don’t just trust the logs

 Any time 
 I use it at the beginning of a test, and when I want 
to target a specific system (admin, etc.) 
 Start slow 
 One or two minutes at first, build up from there 
once you know you’re not impacting the network

 This will mess up your DHCP Table… 
 Mess up the network for hours, days… 
 Great way to create a DoS for a network… 
 Crosses routers into neighboring networks… 
 Used to pass bogus information to target 
systems, like default gateway

 Mandatory Information passed in DHCP Offer: 
 Client IP address 
 DHCP Address 
 Gateway IP Address 
 …more 
 Optional information: 
 Lease Time (Cisco default: one day) 
 Time Server 
 Name Server 
 Domain Name Server 
 Domain Name 
 Host Name

 To work, we need to either race against the 
DHCP Server, or starve out ALL the DHCP 
addresses of the valid DHCP Server 
 As a last resort, only after permission granted
