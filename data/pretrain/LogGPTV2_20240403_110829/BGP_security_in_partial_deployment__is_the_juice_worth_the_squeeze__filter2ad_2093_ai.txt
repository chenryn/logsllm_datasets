shows that attacker is able to attract traﬃc from less than
half of the source ASes in the AS graph, on average. We now
perform a computation and obtain a result that is similar in
spirit; rather than randomly sampling pairs of attackers and
destinations as in [22], we instead compute a lower bound on
our metric over all possible attackers and destinations. We
ﬁnd that HV,V (∅) ≥ 60% on the basic UCLA graph, and
HV,V (∅) ≥ 62% on our IXP-augmented graph.
It is striking that both our and [22]’s result indicate more
than half of the AS graph is already happy even before

S*BGP is deployed. To understand why this is the case,
recall that with origin authentication, an attacking AS m
must announce a bogus path “m, d” that is one hop longer
than the path “d” announced by the legitimate destination
AS d. When we average over all (m, d) pairs and all the
source ASes, bogus paths through m will appear longer, on
average, than legitimate paths through d. Since path length
plays an important role in route selection, on average, more
source ASes choose the legitimate route.
4.3 Does S*BGP give better security?
How much further can we get with a partial deployment
of S*BGP? We now obtain bounds on the improvements in
security that are possible for a given routing policy model,
but for any set S of secure ASes.
We can obtain these bounds thanks to the following cru-
cial observation: ASes can be partitioned into three dis-
tinct categories with respect to each attacker-destination
pair (m, d). Some ASes are doomed to route through the
attacker regardless of which ASes are secure. Others are
immune to the attack regardless of which ASes are secure.
Only the remaining ASes are protectable, in the sense that
whether or not they route through the attacker depends on
which ASes are secure (see Table 2).
To bound our metric HM,D(S) for a given routing policy
model (i.e., security 1st, 2nd, or 3rd) and across all partial-
deployment scenarios S, we ﬁrst partition source ASes into
categories — doomed, immune, and protectable — for each
(m, d) pair and each routing policy model. By computing
the average fraction of immune ASes across all (m, d) ∈
M × D for a given routing model, we get a lower bound
on HM,D(S) ∀S and that routing model. We similarly get
an upper bound on HM,D(S) by computing the average frac-
tion of ASes that are not doomed.
4.3.1 Partitions: Doomed, protectable & immune.
We return to Figure 2 to explain our partitioning:
Doomed. A source AS s is doomed with respect to pair
(m, d) if s routes through m no matter which set S of ASes
is secure. AS 174 in Figure 2 is doomed when security is 2nd
(or 3rd). If security is 2nd (or 3rd), AS 174 always prefers
the bogus customer route to the attacker over a (possibly
secure) peer path to the destination AS 3356, for every S.
Immune. A source AS s is immune with respect to pair
(m, d) if s will route through d no matter which set S of
ASes is secure. AS 3536 in Figure 2 is one example; this
single-homed stub customer of the destination AS 3356 can
never learn a bogus route in any of our security models.
When security is 2nd or 3rd, another example of an immune
AS is AS 10310 in Figure 14; its customer route to the legit-
imate destination AS 40426 is always more attractive than
its provider route to the attacker in these models.
Protectable.
AS s is protectable with respect to pair
(m, d) if it can either choose the legitimate route to d, or

AS 174 in Figure 2 becomes protectable. If it has a secure
route to the destination AS 3356, AS 174 will choose it and
be happy; if not, it will choose the bogus route to m.
4.3.2 Which ASes are protectable?
The intuition behind the following partitioning of ASes is
straightforward. The subtleties involved in proving that an
AS is doomed/immune are discussed in Appendix E.
Security 1st.
Here, we suppose that all ASes are pro-
tectable; the few exceptions (e.g., the single-homed stub of
Figure 2) have little impact on the count of protectable ASes.
Security 2nd.
Here, an AS is doomed if it has a route
to the attacker with better local preference LP than every
available route to the legitimate destination; (e.g., the bogus
customer route oﬀered to AS 174 in Figure 2 has higher LP
than the legitimate peer route). An immune AS has a route
to the destination that has higher LP than every route to
the attacker. For protectable AS, its best available routes
to the attacker and destination have exactly the same LP.
