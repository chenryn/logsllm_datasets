### Current Behavior:
`npm install ` runs pre and post install scripts specified in ``.
### Expected Behavior:
Either pre and post install scripts must not run or this should be explicitly
documented in the npm-install page. Also documentation on npm-scripts page is
confusing with it stating that lifecycle scripts are run on `npm install` and
`npm install -g ` (no mention of `npm install `)
### Environment:
  * OS: Windows 10 x64
  * Node: 14.15.4
  * npm: 7.6.3
