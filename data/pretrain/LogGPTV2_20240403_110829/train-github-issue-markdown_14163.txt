### Current Behavior:
When running `npm install`, the preinstall and postinstall scripts specified in the `package.json` file are executed.

### Expected Behavior:
Either the preinstall and postinstall scripts should not run during the `npm install` command, or this behavior should be explicitly documented on the npm-install page. Additionally, the documentation on the npm-scripts page is unclear, as it states that lifecycle scripts are run during `npm install` and `npm install -g`, but does not mention `npm install <package>`.

### Environment:
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 x64
- **Node.js Version:** 14.15.4
- **npm Version:** 7.6.3
