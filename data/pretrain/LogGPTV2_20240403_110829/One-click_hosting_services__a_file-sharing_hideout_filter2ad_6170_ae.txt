rough estimate of the fraction of copyrighted content indexed in
public OCH indexing sites, we manually examined the 100 most
recent objects listed on each content indexing Web site. We clas-
sify an object as copyrighted if is a commercial movie, song, book
or application, based on the ofﬁcial Web page of the corresponding
content. Figure 17 shows the percentage of objects which appear
to be copyrighted content. More than 84% of the 100 most recent
objects, and in some sites 100% of the objects, appear to be copy-
righted.
We note that OCH services, including RapidShare, are not re-
sponsible for any illegal ﬁle sharing and copyright infringements
that take place using their infrastructure. RapidShare, in particular,

to gradually turn to such services because they often offer better
content availability and higher throughput than p2p networks.
Work on CDNs, like Akamai [1], has focused on the evaluation
and improvement of the redirection and server selection algorithms,
which result in lower latency and better quality-of-experience for
end-users. Krishnamurthy et al. showed, in 2000, that the use of
multiple distributed servers and caching in content distribution can
improve end-to-end Web performance [20]. Johnson et al. mea-
sured the performance of two content distribution networks, Aka-
mai and Digital Island, built over DNS redirection [17]. They note
that both systems provide good but not optimal performance and
conclude that their goal is not to select the best server, but to not
select a bad server. Krishnamurthy et al. proposed a methodology
to study the client-experienced performance using CDNs, and also
performed an extensive study of the use of such systems [21]. The
work presented by Saroiu et al. pursued a trace-based characteriza-
tion of four Content Delivery Systems, Gnutella, Kazaa, WWW
and Akamai [26]. Their results showed that Akamai consumed
only a minimal amount of trafﬁc (0.2%), while Gnutella, WWW
and Kazaa followed with 6.04%, 14.3% and 36.9%, respectively.
10. CONCLUSIONS
Using a combination of passive monitoring and active probing
we provide the ﬁrst, to our knowledge, detailed study of OCH ser-
vices, and of RapidShare in particular. Our results show that OCH
services have reached a level of popularity at which they produce a
signiﬁcant share of the daily Web trafﬁc: a share that in some cases
exceeds the trafﬁc generated by YouTube and similar on-line video
services.
Most users download more than one ﬁle during their daily ses-
sions. Interestingly enough, even over several months of observa-
tion, we saw very little locality of reference in the objects down-
loaded through OCH services, probably reﬂecting the diverse in-
terests of ﬁle sharing users. These locality patterns imply that there
will be no signiﬁcant beneﬁts by caching content near to users,
which indicates that a centralized architecture would be appropriate
for OCH services. Indeed, our experiments revealed that Rapid-
Share employs a centralized, heavily multi-homed server infras-
tructure that is located at a single geographical location. Rapid-
Share servers are grouped together into groups of 12, with each
server in the group hosting the same set of ﬁles. Each server of
the same group belongs to a different IP subnet and it is often con-
nected to a different ISP. With frequent infrastructure expansions,
RapidShare tries to keep its storage capacity evenly distributed among
all server groups, by favoring recently added servers for new ﬁle
uploads.
Comparing RapidShare with BitTorrent, we found that the for-
mer provides better performance than the popular p2p network.
Our experiments suggest that although Free RapidShare users ex-
perience similar throughput with BitTorrent users, Premium Rapid-
Share users experience an order of magnitude higher throughput.
Furthermore, the amount of content shared over RapidShare is larger
than the content shared with BitTorrent. Furthermore, the availabil-
ity of content in RapidShare appears to persist for longer time peri-

content of that ﬁle is not copyrighted. 11 Further, RapidShare does
not provide indexing and search capabilities for the content they
store. Consequently, any copyright infringements that take place
using their infrastruvture is solely a responsibility of the users that
upload and download such content.
9. RELATED WORK
File sharing has attracted signiﬁcant interest over the last ten
years through the emergence of p2p protocols. The effect of p2p
networks has been studied extensively [7, 13, 16, 23, 24]. Saroiu
et al. studied the characteristics of participating peers in Napster
and Gnutella, and observed signiﬁcant heterogeneity and lack of
cooperation among them [25]. Sen and Wang analyzed the char-
acteristics and bandwidth requirements of p2p trafﬁc in large net-
works [27]. Leibowitz et al. examined ﬁle popularity in the Kazaa
network, and its effect on the total trafﬁc volume [22].
The work of Gummadi et al. examined Kazaa’s and Gnutella’s
ﬁle sharing workloads, and revealed signiﬁcant popularity devia-
tions between objects shared in Kazaa and Web objects mostly due
to the “fetch-at-most-once” behavior of Kazaa users [12]. Kara-
giannis et al. on the other hand, showed that ISPs can beneﬁt, in
terms of cost, from locality-aware p2p distribution [18]. Our re-
sults for OCH services suggest that caching will not beneﬁt ISPs
since 75% of the ﬁles in our 4-5 month traces were downloaded
only once.
Several recent studies focused on emerging Web 2.0 applications
that host user-generated content. Gill et al. studied the charac-
teristics of YouTube users’ content in an academic network [10].
Cha et al. also studied user-generated content sites by crawling
YouTube and Daum [4]. Focusing on video popularity, both stud-
ies found that the YouTube video workload is similar to traditional
Web workload, thus end-users and organizations can beneﬁt in through-
put and reduced bandwidth demands, respectively, by employing
caching policies or distribution through p2p systems. In late 2008
Cho et al. observed a slow but steady movement of residential users
towards rich-media content, like YouTube, by comparing data from
2005 and 2008 [5]. During the time period of our study we did not
observe a signiﬁcant increase in OCH trafﬁc, but we expect users

to pay a small fee to enjoy premium service, OCH services appear
likely to compete with BitTorrent as the leading ﬁle-sharing plat-
form.
We also examined OCH content indexing sites, which are an es-
sential component for ﬁle sharing using OCH services. We found
that in OCH services, much like in p2p ﬁle sharing systems, a very
small number of users upload most ﬁles, which are often copy-
righted content, favoring audio albums, video movies, and appli-
cations.
