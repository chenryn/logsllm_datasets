Towards Reliable and High Throughput mmWave Links
SIGCOMM ’21, August 23–27, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
A Constructive Multi-beam is optimal for SNR
and throughput for general k-path channel
Here we show that the multi-beam patterns with appropriate power
and phase control are optimal such that they maximize the SNR at
the receiver. To demonstrate the multi-beam optimality, we first
construct the maximum likelihood (ML) based solution and then
show that the multi-beam approaches the ML estimate. Recall the
optimal beamforming weights for a general multi-path channel h
is given by:
wopt =
h∗
||h|| ,
(21)
which provides the maximum SNR of ||h||2𝑃𝑠
. Note that the optimal
beamforming weights is dependent on the multi-path channel taps.
Our goal is to show how it compares against the SNR of a single
beam and our multi-beam system. We first write the channel in a
geometric model representation [93, 94]:
𝑃𝜂
h(𝑡) =
a(𝜙ℓ)𝛾ℓ𝑒2𝜋 𝑓𝑐𝜏ℓ 𝛿(𝑡 − 𝜏ℓ),
(22)
where we assume the channel is bounded by 𝐿 paths and 𝜙ℓ, 𝛾ℓ, 𝜏ℓ
represents the AoD, attenuation, and ToF of the ℓ𝑡ℎ path, respec-
tively. The steering vector a(𝜙ℓ) represents the relative phase shift
introduced by each path at every antenna element (out of 𝑁 ele-
ments) as
a(𝜙ℓ) = [1, 𝑒−𝑗2𝜋 𝑑
𝜆 sin(𝜙ℓ), . . . , 𝑒−𝑗2𝜋 (𝑁−1) 𝑑
𝜆 sin(𝜙ℓ)]𝑇
In the frequency domain, the channel is written at subcarrier 𝑘
as follow:
𝐿−1
ℓ=0
𝐿−1
ℓ=0
h(𝑘) =
a(𝜙ℓ)𝛾ℓ𝑒 𝑗2𝜋 (𝑓𝑐+𝑘Δ𝑓 )𝜏ℓ
(23)
where 𝑓𝑐 is center frequency and Δ𝑓 is the subcarrier spacing.
The traditional single-beam pattern ignores the multi-path and
creates a directional pattern along the strongest path (LOS or one
of the reflectors). Assuming 𝜙0 is the direction of the strongest path,
the single-beam antenna weights follows:
wsingle = a∗(𝜙0)/||a(𝜙0)||
=
1√
𝑁
[1, 𝑒 𝑗2𝜋 𝑑
𝜆 sin(𝜙0), . . . , 𝑒 𝑗2𝜋 (𝑁−1) 𝑑
𝜆 ) sin(𝜙0)]𝑇 .
(24)
||𝛾0||2𝑃𝑠
Assuming a directional single-beam pattern severely attenuates
other channel paths, the single-beam SNR consists only of the
strongest path as:
.
𝑃𝜂
SNRsingle =
(25)
𝐵−1
Instead, we design phase-coherent multi-beam patterns which ex-
||𝐵−1
ploits 𝐵 channel directions out of 𝐿 paths as follow:
𝑏=0 a∗(𝜙𝑏)𝛾𝑏𝑒 𝑗𝜎𝑏
𝑏=0 a∗(𝜙𝑏)𝛾𝑏𝑒 𝑗𝜎𝑏 || ,
where we orient all the 𝐵 beams in the multi-beam along the 𝐵
strongest paths in the channel. Note that our multi-beam patterns
ensures that per-beam amplitude 𝛾𝑏 and phase 𝜎𝑏 (averaged over all
frequency subcarriers) is aligned with per-path channel attenuation
and phase respectively. We clearly see that when 𝐵 = 𝐿, i.e., the
wmulti =
(26)
multi-beam patterns are oriented along all the paths in a multi-
path channel. In this case, the multi-beam weights are same as the
optimal weights in (21):
(27)
Thus, a multi-beam pattern utilizes 𝐵 out of 𝐿 channel paths to
wmulti = wopt, when 𝐵 = 𝐿.
improve the SNR as follows:
𝐵−1
𝑏=0 ||𝛾𝑏||2𝑃𝑠
,
𝑃𝜂
SNRmulti =
(28)
which converges to optimal SNR for 𝐵 = 𝐿. We can write the
capacity of multibeam-link as
𝐶𝑚𝑏 = log2(1 + SNRmulti)
(29)
The optimal ML beamformer requires per-antenna channel esti-
mate which has a high complexity in terms of beam probing over-
head [14]. Since mmWave channel is sparse and there are only 1 or 2
strong reflected paths in addition to the direct path, the multi-beam
with 2-3 beams provides SNR gain comparable to the optimal beam
with significantly lower overhead.

Gain comparing 28 GHz and 60 GHz system for static UE with 10%

B Comparing constructive multi-beam
performance for 28 GHz and 60 GHz links
mmReliable presents a general framework to improve mmWave
throughput and reliability that can also be applied to a 60 GHz link.
To compare the two systems, we perform a simulation study using
Wireless Insite [95], as shown in Figure 16. We establish a directional
link at 10m with a reflecting surface (made up of concrete material)
at 60𝑜 (Figure 16(a)). We set other simulation parameters according
to a recent large-scale study of a 60 GHz system [2]. The results in
Fig. 16(b) show that mmReliable outperforms single-beam based
baseline [12] by 1.18× gain in throughput for static UE with 10%
blockages. Both 28 GHz and 60 GHz system performs similarly, and
the result is consistent across multiple UE locations. Nonetheless,
28 GHz throughput is 4.7× higher than 60 GHz (not shown) for
the same bandwidth since 60 GHz links suffer from higher path
loss and attenuation due to environmental absorption. Though 28
GHz performance is better for longer links (AOD ≥ 15𝑜) since
60 GHz links suffer from larger path loss and attenuation due to
atmospheric absorption.
