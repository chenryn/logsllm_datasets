User:  What is DNS (Domain Name System)? What does it do?
Assistant: DNS is a service in computer networks that translates domain names into IP addresses. What it does is map a human-rememberable domain name (for example, "google.com") to an IP address that a computer can understand (for example, "216.58.194.174"). This makes it convenient for us not to remember a large number of IP addresses, but to directly enter the domain name to access the website. DNS can also implement functions such as domain name resolution, reverse domain name resolution, load balancing, caching and security protection.
