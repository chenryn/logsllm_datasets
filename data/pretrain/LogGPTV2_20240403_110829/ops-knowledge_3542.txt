User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题OS X Server script to archive (or empty) a users mailbox every morning I have a requirement (SpamAssassin 'training') to archive (or delete) two user's (users are junkmail and notjunkmail) inboxes at a given time every day if there is anything in them. 

Can anyone help me with a script to do such a thing and where to put it and how to get launchd to fire it off at 6am every morning? I can figure out the launchd stuff; it's the moving of messages from inbox to, say, archive that is stumping me.

Script needs to run on the Server as these "users" will likely never log in.

Mac OS X Server 10.6 (soon to be upgraded to 10.7 if that matters)

Thanks!

Assistant: If you are running POP3 or IMAP for your server, getmail might solve your problem: 

Configure it to fetch the mail from the IMAP server and put it into a folder which you can delete (or keep) afterwards. 

Then call this from either a cron or launchd job at the desired time.
