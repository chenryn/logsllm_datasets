Back in Electron 5 I reported issue #18733. It was automatically closed
lately, however it still affects Electron versions up to 11 (but not, as far
as I can tell, version 12). Anyway the instructions said I should reopen it if
it still affects a supported version, so here it is.
Much discussion is on that thread. @dsanders11 diagnosed the problem there.
### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**
    * 5 through 11 (not 12)
  * **Operating System:**
    * Windows 10
  * **Last known Working Electron versions:**
    * 5.0.0.beta8 is OK, 5.0.0.beta9 crashes.
### Expected Behavior
The following code, when run in a renderer process, should not crash.
    let decoder = new TextDecoder("utf8");
    let msg = "a".repeat(4096);		// Exact minimum size that crashes for me, i.e. 4095 does not.
    let buf = Buffer.from(msg);
    decoder.decode(buf);
### Actual Behavior
It does crash in Electron 11, but not Electron 12.
