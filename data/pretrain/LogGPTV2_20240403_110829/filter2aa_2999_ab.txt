### Enhancing Security in the Software Development Lifecycle

#### Introduction
Engineering leaders must implement security tools to protect code integrity and prevent tampering in the build pipeline. Representative providers of these tools include Apiiro, Argon, Cycode, Garantir, GrammaTech, JFrog (Vdoo), and RunSafe Security.

#### Best Practices for CI/CD Pipeline Security
Software engineering teams should adopt the following practices to secure their CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Protect Against Compromised IDEs:**
   - **Risk:** Compromised Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) can result in trojanized builds, posing a significant supply chain security risk. Examples include XcodeGhost malware (Xcode IDE in 2015), Octopus Scanner (NetBeans IDE in 2020), vulnerable VS Code extensions, and Node.js Debugger.
   - **Solution:** Browser-based IDEs can mitigate this risk by either enabling web access to a remote development environment or sandboxing the IDE within the browser's security context. This decouples the development workspace from the physical workstation, which may not be adequately protected. Examples of browser-based IDEs include Codeanywhere, GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod, Replit, and StackBlitz.

2. **Secure the Operating Environment:**
   - **Risk:** Software development environments span multiple distributed systems, platforms, and tools, often communicating with each other using privileged service accounts. Build machines, for instance, communicate with source code repositories to pull source code and artifact repositories to pull common packages, and connect to deployment targets to deploy binaries. The default settings often run with elevated system privileges without proper access controls.
   - **Solution:** Implement least privilege access policies and methods, such as role-based authentication and authorization, adaptive access using zero-trust security models, and privilege access management (PAM). PAM tools help vault privileged passwords, limit access to authorized users, rotate credentials frequently, and monitor the usage of privileged accounts. Vendors such as Akeyless, Britive, and HashiCorp offer solutions that combine dynamic secrets, authentication, authorization, and just-in-time credentials to enforce least privilege access.

3. **Reproducible Builds:**
   - **Principle:** Ensure that a given source code always results in the same build output. Tools like the "reproducible-builds" project and diffoscope can help achieve this.
   - **Benefits:** Reproducible builds allow verification that no vulnerabilities or backdoors have been introduced during the compilation process.

4. **Signed Pipelines:**
   - **Implementation:** Use signed pipelines to create immutable, verifiable artifacts. For example, JFrog Signed Pipelines and Tekton Chains enable signing artifacts generated during a pipeline run to ensure immutability and verify provenance at the end of the pipeline execution.

5. **Zero-Trust Network Access (ZTNA):**
   - **Benefit:** ZTNA provides controlled, identity- and context-aware access to development resources, reducing the attack surface for supply chain attacks. It eliminates excessive implicit trust placed on machines and services simply because they share the same network, replacing it with explicit identity-based trust.

6. **Machine Identity Management (MIM):**
   - **Importance:** Distributed application architectures, cloud-native infrastructure, and APIs-as-products have increased the granularity and volume of machine identities. Machine identities, such as TLS certificates, SSH host keys, OAuth credentials, API tokens, and database connection strings, enable services and endpoints to uniquely authenticate themselves while interacting with other services.
   - **Tools and Providers:** MIM is a collection of practices and tools that enhance the trust and integrity of machine-to-machine interactions. Key management systems, secrets management, PKI and certificate management, and privileged access management are critical components. Providers include Akeyless, AWS, Azure, Fortanix, Thales, and others.

7. **Anomaly Detection and Automated Response:**
   - **Need:** Software engineering teams must work closely with security and risk teams to define and detect anomalous behavior in real time. Tools such as EDR, CWPP, NDR, and osquery can monitor for system anomalies.
   - **Critical Areas:** Anomaly detection and response are especially important in container-native, GitOps-based deployments. Container image scanning tools, traffic visualization, and alerting on anomalous behavior and security events are essential.

#### Case Studies and Additional Resources
- **SolarWinds Attack:** In the SolarWinds attack, attackers modified trusted domains and abused privileged roles, confirming that privileged accounts are a primary target. Mitigating this risk often requires PAM.
- **Open-Source Projects and Standards:**
  - **Grafeas and Kritis:** Tools for managing metadata about software resources and enforcing policy checks in Kubernetes.
  - **SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts):** An end-to-end framework for ensuring the integrity of software artifacts.
  - **Reproducible Builds Project:** Ensures no vulnerabilities or backdoors are introduced during the compilation process.
  - **Typosquatting Attacks:** Typosquatting is a type of supply chain attack where attackers mimic package names. Using artifact registries, software composition analysis, and code scanning can reduce this risk.
  - **Frameworks and Standards:** CNCF, NIST Secure Software Development Framework, and ISO/IEC 27034 provide guidelines and standards for evaluating and enhancing supply chain security.

#### Conclusion
By implementing these best practices and leveraging the right tools, software engineering teams can significantly enhance the security of their CI/CD pipelines and protect against supply chain attacks. Collaboration between engineering, security, and risk teams is crucial for effective anomaly detection and response, ensuring the integrity and security of the software development lifecycle.
