I couldn't figure out to add support for arbitrary class labels to the SVMs
and add a `classes_` attribute.  
I'm moving to other stuff for the moment, it would be great if someone found
some time for this.
The trouble comes with `class_weight` and regression. I think it would be good
to add a `LabelEncoder` somewhere to take care of the encoding of the
`class_weights`. But apparently the implementation also requires a class-
weights on the python side in the regression case. And the `LabelEncoder`
should obviously not be used in the SVR.
This is doable but I couldn't make it pretty so I just left it :-/
