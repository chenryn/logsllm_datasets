# Bug report
## To Reproduce
I'm working on reproducing, but next.js provides zero information about what's
happening, so it's nearly impossible for me to actually identify where the
problem is. All I know is that my code isn't working.
## Expected behavior
Clicking this component should redirect to the about page.
    About
A meta issue: If it does not redirect to the about page, next.js should
provide some debug output to explain why it's not working. It's hard to
isolate a bug when the entire HMR system is blackboxed.
## System information
  * macOS
  * chrome
  * Next.js v 8.0.0
## Additional context
I'm using a custom server and clean routes. The clean route pages do load
properly, but the other pages in the "/pages" directory do not load properly.
If I navigate directly to the url (eg. /about), the About page does load.
