ABSTRACT
5G, as a monumental shift in cellular communication technology,
holds tremendous potential for spurring innovations across many
vertical industries, with its promised multi-Gbps speed, sub-10 ms
low latency, and massive connectivity. On the other hand, as 5G
has been deployed for only a few months, it is unclear how well
and whether 5G can eventually meet its prospects. In this paper, we
demystify operational 5G networks through a first-of-its-kind cross-
layer measurement study. Our measurement focuses on four major
perspectives: (i) Physical layer signal quality, coverage and hand-off
performance; (ii) End-to-end throughput and latency; (iii) Quality
of experience of 5G’s niche applications (e.g., 4K/5.7K panoramic
video telephony); (iv) Energy consumption on smartphones. The
results reveal that the 5G link itself can approach Gbps through-
put, but legacy TCP leads to surprisingly low capacity utilization
(<32%), latency remains too high to support tactile applications
and power consumption escalates to 2− 3× over 4G. Our analysis
suggests that the wireline paths, upper-layer protocols, computing
and radio hardware architecture need to co-evolve with 5G to form
an ecosystem, in order to fully unleash its potential.

1 INTRODUCTION
We are standing on the eve of the 5G era. Major US cellular oper-
ators such as Verizon and AT&T already rolled out their first 5G
deployment in 2019. Meanwhile, China’s three major mobile service
providers officially launched commercial 5G services, and have de-
ployed more than 150 thousand 5G base stations by the end of 2019
[77]. 13.7 million of 5G-enabled smartphones have been sold within
less than a year [94]. It is widely reported that 5G represents a giant
leap beyond 4G. It is expected to attain multi-Gbps wireless bit-rate
for bandwidth-hungry applications like 4K/8K UHD video/VR trans-
mission, ultra reliable and low latency communication (uRLLC) for
auto-driving or telesurgery [92] and also the massive machine to
machine communication for IoT [66, 87]. Overall, 5G is predicted to
generate new economic revenue up to $12.3 trillion across a broad
range of industries [73].
Despite the huge potential, one should be cautious that it takes
time for 5G to evolve and mature. The most recent 5G standard
(3GPP Release-15 [66], standardized in March 2019) focuses on
enhancing network capacity, while low-latency and machine-type
communication tasks are still in progress. Moreover, the current
5G deployment commonly follows the pragmatic Non-standalone
(NSA) mode, reusing the legacy 4G infrastructure to reduce cost.
On the other hand, whereas 5G optimization mainly resides on
the edge (i.e., the radio access network, fronthaul/backhaul and
the cellular core network), the end-to-end performance of mobile
applications also depends on the wireline paths, cloud servers and
even the processing capacity of the mobile devices. All in all, at this
early stage, one natural question is: How far away is 5G from its
prospects and what does it take to reach the tipping point of the
5G ecosystem?
In this paper, we perform a measurement study on one of the
world’s earliest commercial 5G networks, deployed in an urban
environment and running on the sub-6 GHz spectrum. Using 5G-
enabled smartphones and custom-built tools, we conduct in-depth
active-passive measurements to characterize 5G from the physical
layer to application layer, with particular emphasis on its compar-
ison against 4G LTE. Specifically, we build a software toolset to
log 5G’s physical layer information (e.g., channel quality and bit-
rate) and fine-grained energy consumption traces to enable passive
diagnosis. In addition, we leverage high-bandwidth cloud servers
to set up an application service pipeline that can take advantage
of the massive capacity of 5G, so as to enable active probing on
the interactions among applications, networking protocols and the
radio layer.
Measurement perspectives. Our measurement aims to demys-
tify 5G from four major perspectives:
(i) 5G coverage (Sec. 3). In theory, due to its usage of higher fre-
quencies than 4G, the 5G links suffer from more severe attenuation
and penetration loss, leading to poor coverage. To understand the
coverage issues in practice, we develop a 5G channel analytics tool
based on XCAL-Mobile [4] – a commercial 5G air-interface moni-
toring framework. As a result, we can profile a comprehensive set of
physical layer metrics, including signal strength, bit-rate, hand-off
timing, etc, separated on a per-cell basis.
(ii) End-to-end throughput and delay (Sec. 4). 5G claims to support
Gbps bit-rate and sub-10 ms latency, through its New Radio (NR)
technology and a more flat core network architecture. However,
its practical performance faces many attrition factors, e.g., limited
capacity of wire-line paths, poor interaction across layers within
the network stack and link quality disruptions due to frequent
hand-off across cells (each with limited coverage). To understand
how these factors manifest in practice, we measure the end-to-
end performance of mainstream transport-layer protocols, along
with a breakdown of network latency. Our measurement identifies
the bottlenecks and sources of anomalies that prevent 5G from
delivering its expected performance.
(iii) Application performance (Sec. 5). Besides network perfor-
mance, the application quality of experience (QoE) also depends
on other factors, especially the processing capabilities of end-user
devices. We thus investigate the inter-play between the communica-
tion and computing factors, by implementing a 4K/5.7K panoramic
real-time video delivery system and characterizing the feasibility
and challenges of the much anticipated immersive technologies
over 5G.
(iv) 5G smartphone energy consumption (Sec. 6). 5G’s high bit-rate
comes at the cost of power-hungry signal/packet processors and
RF hardware. In this paper, we develop an energy profiling tool -
pwrStrip, to quantitatively analyze the power consumption on a
typical 5G smartphone. Our analysis can breakdown the energy
cost across different hardware/software components, as well as
different radio states.
Summary of insights. Our measurement campaign leads to
several major insights, which we summarize as follows:
(i) Our measurement reveals that even though the current 5G is
2 per base station), there
densely deployed (approximately 0.077 km
still exist many coverage holes outdoor. In addition, 5G channel
quality suffers from a sharp degradation when transitioning indoor,
with a drop of 50.59%, in comparison to 20.38% for 4G. Remarkably,
we find that the current 5G base stations are all co-sitting with 4G
ones, implying that the densification potential of 5G deployment
can be further exploited.
(ii) We find that the de facto loss/delay based transport protocols
(e.g., Cubic, Vegas) behave abnormally when running over 5G, with
a bandwidth utilization below 32%. An in-depth analysis shows that
the legacy core Internet routers tend to cause excessive packet drops
under 5G workloads. We identify and verify two possible solutions -
proper buffer sizing, and adopting loss/latency-insensitive probing
based transport protocols. In term of network latency, we find that
the current 5G NR reduces “in air” latency by only less than 1ms,
while the flatten core network architecture reduces latency by 20ms.
However, the end-to-end latency remains similar to 4G LTE, as
it is dominated by the wire-line paths. The results hint that the
legacy Internet infrastructure also needs to be retrofitted to meet
the prospects of the low-latency 5G. On the other hand, mobility
worsens 5G latency. We find the cross-cell hand-off takes around
108.4ms, 3.6× longer compared to 4G, mainly due to the use of the
NSA architecture.
(iii) As for application performance, we find that 5G offers negli-
gible benefits to mobile Web loading, whose latency is dominated
by either page rendering time or TCP’s transient behavior which
severely under-utilizes the network bandwidth. For 4K panoramic
video telephony, 5G can improve video quality and smoothness ow-
ing to its high throughput. However, the codec/processing latency
tends to outweigh transmission time by 10×, i.e., the computing
sumption, 2−3× over 4G and 1.8× over screen display which used to
modules become the bottleneck in such demanding 5G use cases.
(iv) We find the 5G module results in alarmingly high power con-
dominate the 4G phone power budget [42]. More interestingly, such
high power consumption is intrinsic to the 5G radio hardware and
DRX state machine, which makes standard power-saving schemes
ineffective. Our trace-driven simulation shows that an oracle sleep
scheduling mechanism can only reduce 5G power consumption
by 16.02%, 12.24% and 11.17% for web browsing, video telephony
and bulk file transfer, respectively; Whereas our heuristic-based
scheme, which opportunistically offloads certain traffic to 4G, can
achieve 25.04% power saving compared to the 4G module.
Our contributions. To our knowledge, this work represents
the first cross-layer study of operational 5G New Radio (NR, or sub-6
GHz) networks, through a comprehensive measurement toolset. Our
main contributions can be summarized as follows: (i) Quantita-
tive characterization of 5G’s coverage in comparison to 4G, which
offers hints for optimizing deployment and hand-off/mobility man-
agement. (ii) Identifying an alarming TCP anomaly that severely
underutilizes 5G capacity, diagnosing the root causes and proposing
practical solutions. (iii) A breakdown analysis of the 5G end-to-end
latency which pinpoints the bottleneck and space for improvement.
(iv) Implementation and profiling of a 5G immersive media appli-
cation to explore the feasibility and underlying challenges. (v) A
detailed accounting of the power budget on 5G smartphones, along
with pragmatic mechanisms to improve 5G energy efficiency. (vi)
We have released our dataset and measurement tools to the public
[68] for facilitating the future study.
2 MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY
5G network. Our measurement is conducted in a densely pop-
ulated city, which is one of the first regions with 5G coverage
worldwide (i.e., launched in April 2019). Most of our experiments
focus specifically on a 0.5km× 0.92km campus, where 6 5G base
stations (gNBs) are deployed, surrounded by tall buildings, trees
and heavy human activities. The 5G deployment adopts the NSA
infrastructure, wherein a 5G gNB is co-located with an existing 4G
base station (eNB). Under NSA, the 5G radio only operates within
the data plane (or user plane), and relies on the legacy 4G LTE for
control plane operations, as shown in Fig. 1. Both 5G gNBs and
4G eNBs share the same 4G Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network
infrastructure [52]. To our knowledge, all the existing commercial
5G services are provided under the NSA architecture, due to its
480
using existing or custom-built tools: (i) The 5G and 4G signaling
information and physical-layer key performance indicators (KPIs)
from a commercial software - XCAL-Mobile [4]; (ii) The TCP/UDP
traffic traces generated by iperf3 [58] and captured by Wireshark
[3]; (iii) The end-to-end delay along with per-hop latency extracted
from traceroute [15]; (iv) Page loading time and video frame in-
formation gained from Google Chrome developer tools and our
custom-built 5G application called 360TEL. (v) The smartphone
energy consumption traces obtained by a custom-built tool named
pwrStrip. We proceed to provide more details on this tool set.
XCAL-Mobile runs on a laptop tethered to the Axon10 smart-
phone via a USB3 cable (Fig. 1). It can monitor the smartphone’s
diagnostic interface, including (i) basic cellular network KPIs on the
physical and MAC layers, such as PCI, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, CQI, MCS
and the PRB allocation configurations. (ii) Signaling messages on
the cellular control plane, allowing us to monitor hand-off start/end
time, RRC state machine transitions, etc. We note that the advan-
tage of XCAL-Mobile over other wireless network analyzers like
MobileInsight [55] mainly lie in its capabilities in decoding the 5G
signaling messages following the 3GPP Rel-15. To our knowledge,
no other analysis tools possess similar capabilities to date.
Our TCP/UDP experiments are conducted using iperf3, of which
the server-side is deployed in the cloud and the client-side executes
on our 5G-devices. We set the receiver’s buffer size to 25 MB, which
is enough to avoid the small initial receiving window problem [46].
For each experiment, we log the traffic traces by Wireshark for
off-line analysis.
For examining application-level performance, we develop a UHD
panoramic live video Android APP (360TEL) based on the Insta360
ONEX’s open APIs [76]. 360TEL runs on the 5G phone, which
connects to an external panoramic camera with an H.264 hardware
codec (Fig. 1). It can stream the captured 360○ videos to the cloud
server running EasyDSS RTMP [17], with up to 5.7K resolution
and 30 FPS frame rate. 360TEL can be considered as a real-time
panoramic video telephony system to enable immersive experience
