I create this post to bring attention to this thread where I explain my
problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57269797/aggregate-several-
axessubplot-after-multiprocessing-to-draw-a-matplotlib-figure It provides
details and reproducible code, so I prefer to not duplicate.
Can someone tell me if it's a bug or if I missed something in my code ?
Thanks in advance !
