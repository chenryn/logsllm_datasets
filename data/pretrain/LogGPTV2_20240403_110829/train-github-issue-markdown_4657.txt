  * Electron version: **v1.3.5**
  * Operating system: **win7 x64**
I have created a simple example here: there are only two files in the
directory: _package.json_ and _main.js_. I'm sured that they are saved by
UTF-8 encoding.  
There are only two keys in _package.json_ : _name_ and _main_ , just like this
    {
        "name":"simple-example",
        "main":"main.js"
    }
the _main.js_ has only one line:  
`console.log("中文")`
When I run `electron .` under that directory, the output on console is not
right.

While if I run node main.js, I can see the expected result:

I think there are something wrong with encoding, can anyone here tell me how
to fix it and why?
