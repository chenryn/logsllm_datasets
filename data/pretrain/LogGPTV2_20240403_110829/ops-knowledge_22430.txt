### Summary of the Log Chunk

The provided log chunk, consisting of 25 lines, documents a series of events related to address changes and lease renewals in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Address Changes:**
   - Multiple address changes were detected for the server `msra-sa-41`:
     - From `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
     - From `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

2. **Lease Renewal Attempts:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component (user `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`) is attempting to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - Lease renewal attempts are failing, with the error persisting over several seconds (352, 353, 354, 355, and 356 seconds).
   - Each failure is followed by a message indicating that the system will retry shortly.

3. **Connection Retries:**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is attempting to connect to the server `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The connection attempts are being retried, with the following retry policy: `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)`.
   - Each retry attempt is logged, and the system has tried 0 times so far.

4. **Errors in Contacting the Resource Manager (RM):**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is encountering errors while trying to contact the RM.
   - These errors are logged at the `ERROR` level, indicating a significant issue in communication.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Log Levels:**
  - The log entries span from `10-18 18:10:49` to `10-18 18:10:55`.
  - The log levels include `WARN`, `INFO`, and `ERROR`.

- **Relevant Software Components:**
  - `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`
  - `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`
  - `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator`

- **Key Events:**
  - **Address Change Detection:**
    - Multiple `WARN` messages indicate that the address of the server `msra-sa-41` has changed.
    - This change is consistently from an IP-based address to a hostname-based address.

  - **Lease Renewal Failures:**
    - The `LeaseRenewer` is unable to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
    - The failure duration increases incrementally (352, 353, 354, 355, 356 seconds).

  - **Connection Retry Attempts:**
    - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is retrying connections to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
    - The retry policy is set to a maximum of 10 retries with a fixed sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each attempt.

  - **Errors in Contacting RM:**
    - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` logs `ERROR` messages indicating that it is unable to contact the RM.
    - This suggests a potential network or configuration issue preventing successful communication.

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with address changes, failed lease renewals, and repeated connection attempts to the RM. The system is configured to retry these operations, but the persistent failures suggest a need for further investigation into the underlying causes, such as network connectivity, server configuration, or resource manager availability.
