## Abstract

As vehicles incorporate more software modules and external interfaces, new security threats and vulnerabilities are emerging. Researchers have demonstrated methods to compromise in-vehicle Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and manipulate vehicle operations. Various defense mechanisms have been proposed, but they often fall short in protecting safety-critical ECUs from in-vehicle network attacks. To address this, we introduce Clock-based IDS (CIDS), an anomaly-based intrusion detection system. CIDS measures the intervals of periodic in-vehicle messages to fingerprint ECUs. It then uses the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm to establish a baseline of ECU clock behaviors. CIDS employs Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) to detect deviations from this baseline, indicating potential intrusions. This approach achieves a low false-positive rate of 0.055% and facilitates root-cause analysis by identifying the compromised ECU. Our experiments on a CAN bus prototype and real vehicles demonstrate CIDS's effectiveness in detecting a wide range of in-vehicle network attacks.

## 1. Introduction

Vehicle security has become a critical concern with the rise of connected and automated vehicles. Recent studies have shown that in-vehicle ECUs can be compromised through various attack vectors, such as Bluetooth and cellular networks, allowing adversaries to control the vehicle by injecting malicious packets into the in-vehicle network. For instance, researchers successfully compromised and remotely stopped a Jeep Cherokee, leading to a recall of 1.4 million vehicles. These incidents highlight the urgent need for robust automotive security solutions.

Two primary defense strategies against in-vehicle network attacks are message authentication and intrusion detection. While message authentication provides a level of security, its implementation in in-vehicle networks is challenging due to limited space for Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and the need for real-time processing and communication.

Various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been proposed, focusing on monitoring message contents and periodicity. However, these systems have limitations, particularly in detecting masquerade attacks, where messages do not carry information about their transmitters. To overcome these limitations, we propose CIDS, which fingerprints ECUs by measuring the intervals of periodic in-vehicle messages. This method does not rely on embedded timestamps, making it resistant to attackers using faked timestamps. CIDS constructs a norm model of ECU clock behaviors using the RLS algorithm and detects intrusions with CUSUM. Our experimental results show that CIDS effectively detects a wide range of in-vehicle network attacks with a low false-positive rate and can identify the compromised ECU.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Primer on CAN Protocol

CAN (Controller Area Network) is the most widely used in-vehicle communication protocol, connecting ECUs via a multi-master, message broadcast bus system. CAN frames, which exchange data between ECUs, contain fields such as ID, Data Length Code (DLC), Data, and CRC. The ID field represents the priority and meaning of the frame. For example, a frame with ID=0x20 might contain wheel speed values, while a frame with ID=0x55 might contain temperature values.

**Arbitration:** When multiple nodes attempt to access the bus simultaneously, arbitration resolves the contention. Nodes transmit the ID value bit by bit, and the node with the lowest ID value wins arbitration and gains exclusive access to the bus.

**Synchronization:** Bit synchronization in CAN is achieved through the Start-of-Frame (SOF) signal and bit stuffing. However, CAN lacks clock synchronization, leading to random drifting of ECU clocks.

### 2.2 Related Work

**Message Authentication:** Cryptographic message authentication provides strong protection against forgery. However, appending MACs in CAN frames is challenging due to limited payload space. Some approaches, such as truncating MACs across multiple frames or using out-of-band channels, have been proposed but come with significant overhead and may not handle all types of attacks, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS).

**Intrusion Detection:** Existing IDSs exploit the periodic nature of CAN messages to detect anomalies. For example, some systems monitor message intervals and measure their entropies. Others verify message contents using in-vehicle sensors. Despite their effectiveness, these systems often fail to detect more sophisticated attacks, such as masquerade attacks, where the transmitter's identity is unknown.

## 3. Attack Model

### 3.1 Adversary Model

Adversaries can compromise in-vehicle ECUs through various means, such as physical access or remote exploitation. We consider two types of compromised ECUs: fully and weakly compromised. A fully compromised ECU allows the attacker to inject arbitrary messages, while a weakly compromised ECU can only stop or suspend message transmissions.

**Strong and Weak Attackers:** The capabilities of an attacker depend on the ECU's hardware and software. A strong attacker has full control over the ECU and can inject fabricated messages, while a weak attacker can only stop or listen to message transmissions. The firmware version of an ECU determines whether it can be a strong or weak attacker if compromised.

### 3.2 Attack Scenarios

**Fabrication Attack:** A strong attacker fabricates and injects messages with forged IDs, DLCs, and data to override legitimate messages from safety-critical ECUs.

**Suspension Attack:** A weak attacker stops or suspends the transmission of certain messages, causing disruptions in the in-vehicle network.

**Masquerade Attack:** An attacker impersonates a legitimate ECU by sending messages with a forged ID, making it difficult for existing IDSs to detect the attack.

## 4. Design of CIDS

CIDS fingerprints ECUs by measuring the intervals of periodic in-vehicle messages. It then uses the RLS algorithm to model the norm behavior of ECU clocks and CUSUM to detect deviations from this baseline. This approach is effective in detecting a wide range of in-vehicle network attacks and can identify the compromised ECU.

## 5. Evaluation

We evaluated CIDS on a CAN bus prototype and three real vehicles. The results show that CIDS can detect various types of in-vehicle network intrusions with a low false-positive rate of 0.055%. Additionally, CIDS can identify the compromised ECU, facilitating root-cause analysis.

## 6. Discussion

CIDS is designed for CAN, the de facto standard in-vehicle network. Its applicability to other in-vehicle network protocols is also discussed. The ubiquity of CAN and its direct impact on driver and passenger safety make it crucial to develop a capable CAN bus IDS.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper presents CIDS, a novel anomaly-based IDS for in-vehicle networks. CIDS fingerprints ECUs by measuring the intervals of periodic messages and uses the RLS and CUSUM algorithms to detect intrusions. Our experimental results demonstrate CIDS's effectiveness in detecting a wide range of in-vehicle network attacks with a low false-positive rate and the ability to identify the compromised ECU.
