Hi!  
I'm trying to run this new Windows Terminal.
After some difficulties and a few attempts I was able to build and deploy the
project locally.  
_Â«Great! Finally!Â»_ I said to myself, just before clicking on the `Windows
Terminal (Dev Build)` in the Start menu...
This was the result: an empty window.

After a few seconds, it simply disappeared and then...  
Well... Nothing more!

Here are some useful (hopefully) information about my current system:
> Windows 10 1903 Build 18362.175  
>  x64 architecture  
>  `Developer mode` enabled  
>  Repo version built: v0.2.1715.0 (`66cb7c4`)  
>  Build with Visual Studio 2019  
>  Built and deployed for x64 architecture

Some time ago, I commented already here (#489 (comment)) explaining the same
issue...  
But, nobody could help me.
Maybe opening a Issue I will be luckier...
