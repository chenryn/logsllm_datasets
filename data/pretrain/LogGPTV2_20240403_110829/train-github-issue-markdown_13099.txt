Hello,

I recently attempted to run the new Windows Terminal and, after overcoming a few initial challenges, I was able to successfully build and deploy the project on my local machine. Feeling relieved, I launched the `Windows Terminal (Dev Build)` from the Start menu, only to be greeted by an empty window.

Here is a screenshot of what I encountered:

After a few seconds, the window disappeared without any further indication or error message.

Below are some details about my system configuration that might be useful for troubleshooting:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 1903, Build 18362.175
- **Architecture:** x64
- **Developer Mode:** Enabled
- **Repository Version Built:** v0.2.1715.0 (`66cb7c4`)
- **Build Tool:** Visual Studio 2019
- **Target Architecture:** x64

Some time ago, I commented on this issue in #489, but unfortunately, no one was able to provide a solution. I am hoping that by opening a new issue, I might have better luck in finding a resolution.

I apologize if this seems like a duplicate post, but I am eager to resolve this problem.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
