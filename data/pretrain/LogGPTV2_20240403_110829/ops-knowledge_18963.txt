User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SNMP Service Throws Error 1500 and Returns Bad Information In my environment, I have SolarWinds Orion monitoring Windows Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 boxes.  Occasionally, monitors will flap or fail, even though the monitored item has not failed or met the failure criteria.

In the event log, I find a service restart and a failure to read the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters\TrapConfiguration key.

The error in the event log is EventID 1500 in the System Log with an Event Source of SNMP and an error message of "The SNMP Service encountered an error while accessing the registry key SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters\TrapConfiguration."

Assistant: I found this support article which details the error and provides a workaround.  The workaround creates the missing key.

I then created a GPO which has a Group Policy Preference to create at key if it does not exist.

I'm going to continue to monitor and see if that resolves the intermittent failures.
