User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Logrotate: Rotating non-log files? I have a backup script that compresses various files and directories and creates .tgz archives. Files are named, e.g.

...
backup_2010-10-28.tar.gz
backup_2010-10-29.tar.gz
backup_2010-10-30.tar.gz
backup_2010-10-31.tar.gz
backup_2010-11-01.tar.gz


I want to manage these files so only the last 5 backups are kept, with older files being deleted.

Can I use logrotate to do this? They aren't log files and are already compressed. They're in /root and not in /var/log - can I still use it?

Thanks

Assistant: Without a change to your process, logrotate on its own will not do what you're looking for here.  The key problem here is that, while logrotate can take wildcards, it will not treat the files as one if you do so and will instead attempt to rotate all of them individually, which is definitely NOT what you want.

You can, however, make it work the way you describe as long as the most recent backup is created without a date stamp.  If you backup process creates /root/backup.tar.gz for instance, you could use the following logrotate configuration:

/root/backup.tar.gz {
    rotate 5
    nocompress
    dateext
    dateformat _%Y-%m-%d
    extension .tar.gz
    missingok
}


The quick rundown of the options here:


rotate 5 -- keep 5 rotations before deleting
nocompress -- do not compress the files after rotating
dateext -- use the date as the rotation extension instead of incrementing numbers
dateformat _%Y-%m-%d -- set the date extension format you want to use
extension .tar.gz -- make the .tar.gz come after the rotation extension
missingok -- if the file we want to rotate isn't there, don't worry about it and move on (the default is to throw an error)


Hope this helps!
