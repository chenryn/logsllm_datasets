# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.356]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.5.2661.0
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Create three tabs
  2. Use the CTRL+ALT+{1,2,3} short cut to quickly jump between tabs in random order
I've had the problem occur under more normal usage, but the above steps
reproduce it consistently.
# Expected behavior
Tabs continue to change and apply focus.
# Actual behavior
At least one tab will forget it's focused pane, causing:
a) The tab's title to go blank  
b) The keyboard bindings to stop responding
Clicking inside the tab's terminal restores the focus, title, and binding
responsiveness.
