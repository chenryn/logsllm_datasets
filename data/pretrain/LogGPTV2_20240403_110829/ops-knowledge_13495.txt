User: I have tried setting my System variable Path=C:\Python27\Scripts\
I also have set User Variable Path=C:\Python27\ 
I can see it return correctly when I echo %PATH%
What else is needed for pip to work correctly?
Assistant: So I found my issue. Was running cmd prompt from P4 directly which was my issue. When running cmd prompt outside of P4 I was able to run pip with no issues.
