nerable network infrastructure, poor attacker attribution, and the ability to choose 
their time and place of attack.
Defenders are not without resources. They own what should be the most power-
ful asset in the battle – home-field advantage, and they must begin to use it more 
wisely. Defenders have indigenous “super-user” rights throughout the network, and 
they can change hardware and software configurations at will. They can build re-
dundancy into their operations and implement out-of-band cross-checking of impor-
tant information. Such tactics are essential because cyber attack methods evolve so 
quickly that static, predictable defenses are doomed to fail. A primary goal should 
be to create a unique environment that an attacker has never seen before. This will 
require imagination, creativity, and the use of deception.
Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; 
and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack. AoW: VI. 
Weak Points and Strong
Adversary cyber reconnaissance should be made as difficult as possible. Adversar-
ies must have to work hard for their intelligence, and they should doubt that the 
information they were able to steal is accurate. Attackers should be forced to lose 
time, wander into digital traps, and betray information regarding their identity and 
intentions. 
Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful ap-
pearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something that the 
enemy may snatch at it. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a 
body of picked men he lies in wait for him. AoW: V. Energy
As in athletics, cyber warfare tactics are often related to leverage. In an effort to 
gain the upper hand, both attackers and defenders attempt to dive deeper than 
their opponent into files, applications, operating systems, compilers, and hardware. 
Strategic attacks even target future technologies at their source – the research and 
development networks of software companies or personnel working in the defense 
industry.
The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth... 
AoW: IV. Tactical Dispositions
In fact, professional hacker tools and tactics are stealthy enough that a wise system 
administrator should presume some level of system breach at all times. Defenses 
should be designed on the assumption that there is always a digital spy somewhere 
in the camp.

Sun Tzu: Can Our Best Military Doctrine Encompass Cyber War?
One of the first challenges in cyber warfare is simply to know if you are under at-
tack. Therefore, a good short-term cyber defense goal is to improve an organization’s 
ability to collect, evaluate, and transmit digital evidence.
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred 
battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also 
suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every 
battle. AoW: III. Attack by Stratagem
In the late 1990s, Moonlight Maze, the “largest cyber-intelligence investigation 
ever,” uncovered wide-ranging attacks targeting U.S. technical research, government 
contracts, encryption techniques, and war-planning data. Despite years of effort, 
law enforcement was able to find “disturbingly few clues” to help determine attribu-
tion.339 And because cyber warfare is a new phenomenon that changes so quickly, 
it is difficult even for law enforcement officers to be sure they are operating within 
the constraints of the law.
A long-term national objective should be the creation of a Distant Early Warning 
Line for cyber war. National security threats, such as propaganda, espionage, and 
attacks on critical infrastructure, have not changed, but they are now Internet-en-
abled. Adversaries have a new delivery mechanism that can increase the speed, 
diffusion, and even the power of an attack.
Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, 
and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge. AoW: XIII. 
The Use of Spies
Because IT security is a highly technical discipline, a broader organizational support 
structure must be built around it. To understand the capabilities and intentions of 
potential adversaries, such an effort must incorporate the analysis of both cyber and 
non-cyber data points. Geopolitical knowledge is critical. Whenever international 
tension is high, cyber defenders must now take their posts. In today’s Middle East, 
it is safe to assume that cyber attacks will always accompany the conflict on the 
ground. For example, in 2006 as fighting broke out between Israel and Gaza, pro-
Palestinian hackers denied service to around 700 Israeli Internet domains.340
Information collection and evaluation were so important to Sun Tzu that the entire 
final chapter of Art of War is devoted to espionage. Spies are called the “sovereign’s 
339 Adams, 2001: Russian telephone numbers were eventually associated with the hacks, but the U.S. was 
unable to gain further attribution.

most precious faculty” and espionage a “divine manipulation of the threads.” The 
cost of spying, when compared to combat operations, is said to be so low that it is 
the “height of inhumanity” to ignore it. Such a commander is “no leader of men, no 
present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.”341
In the wars of the future, brains will beat brawn with increasing frequency. Fol-
lowing the IT Revolution, the need for investment in human capital has risen dra-
matically. However, cyber defense is still an immature discipline, and it is difficult to 
retain personnel with highly marketable training. To gain a long-term competitive 
advantage, a nation must invest in science and technology as a national priority.342
Objective Calculations
Sun Tzu warns that a commander must exhaustively and dispassionately analyze all 
available information. Offensive operations in particular should wait until a decisive 
victory is expected. If objective calculations yield an unfavorable result, the inferior 
party must assume a defensive posture until circumstances have changed in its 
favor.343
Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the 
battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations before-
hand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how 
much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who 
is likely to win or lose. AoW: I. Laying Plans
In any conflict, there are prevailing environmental and situational factors over which 
the combatants have little control. Art of War lists over three dozen such factors to 
evaluate, including offense/defense, orthodox/unorthodox, rested/exhausted, dry/
wet, and confident/afraid.344 Most of these will have direct or indirect parallels in 
cyberspace.
In cyberspace, reliable calculations are extremely difficult to perform. First and fore-
most, cyber attackers possess enough advantages over defenders that there is an 
enormous gap in Return-on-Investment (RoI) between them. The cost of conducting 
a cyber attack is cheap, and there is little penalty for failure. Network reconnais-
sance can be conducted, without fear of retaliation, until a suitable vulnerability is 
found. Once an adversary system is compromised and exploited, there are often im-

mediate rewards. By comparison, cyber defense is expensive and challenging, and 
there is no tangible RoI.
Another aspect of cyberspace that makes calculation difficult is its constantly 
changing nature. The Internet is a purely artificial construct that is modified contin-
ually from across the globe. Cyber reconnaissance and intelligence collection are of 
reliable valuable to a military commander only for a short period of time. The geog-
raphy of cyberspace changes without warning, and software updates and network 
reconfiguration create an environment where insurmountable obstacles and golden 
opportunities can appear and disappear as if by magic. The terrestrial equivalent 
could only be a catastrophic event such as an earthquake or an unexpected snow-
storm.
Art of War describes six types of battlefield terrain, ranging from “accessible,” which 
can be freely traversed by both sides, to “narrow passes,” which must either be 
strongly garrisoned or avoided altogether (unless the adversary has failed to fortify 
them).345 Although they will change over time, cyber equivalents for each Art of War 
terrain type are easily found in Internet, intranet, firewall, etc.
The natural formation of the country is the soldier’s best ally; but a power of estimat-
ing the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating 
difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general. AoW: X. 
Terrain
Cyberspace possesses characteristics that the Art of War framework does not en-
compass. For example, in cyberspace the terrestrial distance between adversaries 
can be completely irrelevant. If “connectivity” exists between two computers, attacks 
can be launched at any time from anywhere in the world, and they can strike their 
targets instantly. There is no easily defined “front line;” civilian and military zones 
on the Internet often share the same space, and military networks typically rely on 
civilian infrastructure to operate. With such amazing access to an adversary, never 
before in history has superior logic – not physical size or strength – more often de-
termined the victor in conflict.
Similar to cyber geography, cyber weapons also have unreliable characteristics. 
Some attacks that hackers expect to succeed fail, and vice versa. Exploits may work 
on one, but not another, apparently similar target. Exploits that work in one instance 
may never work again. Thus, it can be impossible to know if a planned cyber attack 
will succeed until the moment it is launched. Cyber weapons should be considered 
single-use weapons because defenders can reverse-engineer them to defend their

networks or try to use them for their own offensive purposes. These limitations 
make meticulous pre-operational cyber attack planning and timing critical.346347
Last but not least, one of the major challenges confronting any military commander 
is to keep track of the location and constitution of adversary forces. However, cyber 
defenses such as passive network monitoring devices can be nearly impossible to 
find.
If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds sur-
rounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick under-
growth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where 
men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking. AoW: IX. The Army on the 
March
Cyber commanders are wise to assume, especially if they are conducting an of-
fensive operation on adversary terrain, that the defenses and traps they can see 
are more powerful than they appear, and that there are some defenses in place that 
they will never find. Adversary sensors could even lie on the open Internet, such as 
on a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP), outside of the cyber terrain that the 
adversary immediately controls.
Time to Fight
Once the decision to go to war has been made (or forced), Sun Tzu offers plenty of 
battlefield advice to a military commander. Art of War operations emphasize speed, 
surprise, economy of force, and asymmetry. These characteristics happen to be syn-
onymous with cyber warfare.
Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy’s unreadiness, make your 
way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots. AoW: XI. The Nine Situations
If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chanc-
es are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the 
purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores. AoW: VII. Maneuvering
The potential role of computer network operations in military conflict has been 
compared to strategic bombing, submarine warfare, special operations forces, and

assassins.348 The goal of such unorthodox, asymmetric attacks is to inflict painful 
damage on an adversary from a safe distance or from close quarters with the ele-
ment of surprise.
By discovering the enemy’s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can 
keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy’s must be divided.... Hence there will 
be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be 
many to the enemy’s few. AoW: VI. Weak Points and Strong
In theory, a cyber attack can accomplish the same objectives as a special forces raid, 
with the added benefit of no human casualties on either side. If cyber attacks were 
to achieve that level of success, they could come to redefine elegance in warfare.
A cyber attack is best understood not as an end in itself, but as an extraordinary 
means to accomplish almost any objective. Cyber propaganda can reach the entire 
world in seconds via online news media. Cyber espionage can be used to steal even 
nuclear weapons technology.349 Moreover, a successful cyber attack on an electrical 
grid could bring down myriad other infrastructures that have no other source of 
power.350 In fact, in 2008 and 2009, hackers were able to force entire nation-states 
offline.351
Attacking a nation’s critical infrastructure is an old idea. Militaries seek to win not 
just individual battles, but wars. Toward that end, they must reduce an adversary’s 
long-term ability to fight. And the employment of a universal tool to attack an ad-
versary in creative ways is not new. Witness Sun Tzu’s advice from Art of War on 
the use of fire:
There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; 
the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn 
arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy. AoW: 
XII. The Attack by Fire
Sun Tzu did not know that baggage trains would one day need functioning comput-
ers and uncompromised computer code to deliver their supplies on time.
Specific tactical advice from Art of War provides a clear example. As in the Syrian air 
defense attack cited above, Sun Tzu instructs military commanders to accomplish

something for which digital denial-of-service (DoS) appears ideal – to sever commu-
nications between adversary military forces.
Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the 
enemy’s front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; 
to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men. 
AoW: XI. The Nine Situations
If modern military forces use the Internet as their primary means of communica-
tion, what happens when the Internet is down? Thus it is likely that cyber attacks 
will play their most critical role when launched in concert with a conventional mili-
tary (or terrorist) attack.
Sun Tzu warns that surprise attacks may come when a defender’s level of alert is 
lowest:
Now a soldier’s spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and 
in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp. A clever general, therefore, 
avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to 
return. This is the art of studying moods. AoW: VII. Maneuvering
Cyber criminals already operate according to this rule. They know the work sched-
ules of network security personnel and often launch attacks in the evening, on week-
ends, or on holidays when cyber defenders are at home. Unfortunately, given the 
current challenges facing cyber defense, it may be possible simply to tie up com-
puter security specialists with diversionary attacks while the critical maneuvers 
take place elsewhere.
If an invasion is successful, Sun Tzu advises military commanders to survive as 
much as possible on the adversary’s own resources.
Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the 
enemy’s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one’s own, and likewise a single picul 
of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one’s own store. AoW: II. Waging War
In this sense, Art of War and cyber warfare correspond perfectly. In computer hack-
ing, attackers typically steal the credentials and privileges of an authorized user, af-
ter which they effectively become an insider in the adversary’s (virtual) uniform. At 
that point, inflicting further damage on the network – and thus on the people using 
that network and their mission – through DoS or espionage is far easier. Such attacks 
could include poisoned pen correspondence and/or critical data modification. Even 
107
Sun Tzu: Can Our Best Military Doctrine Encompass Cyber War?
if the compromise is discovered and contained, adversary leadership may lose its 
trust in the computer network and cease to use it voluntarily.
Finally, cyber warfare is no different from other military disciplines in that the suc-
cess of an attack will depend on keeping its mission details a secret.
Divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through 
you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands. AoW: VI. Weak 
Points and Strong
In military jargon, this is called operational security (OPSEC). However, the charac-
teristics that make cyber warfare possible – the ubiquity and interconnected nature 
of the Internet – ironically make good OPSEC more difficult than ever to achieve. 
Open source intelligence (OSINT) and computer hacking can benefit cyber defense 
as much as cyber offense.
The Ideal Commander
Decision-making in a national security context carries significant responsibilities 
because lives are often at stake. Thus, on a personal level, Art of War leadership 
requirements are high.
The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage 
and strictness. AoW: I. Laying Plans
Good leaders not only exploit flawed plans, but flawed adversaries.352 Discipline and 
self-control are encouraged; emotion and personal desire are discouraged.353 Sun
