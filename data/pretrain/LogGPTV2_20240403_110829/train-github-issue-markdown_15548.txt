#### Issue Description
We frequently get emails from campers complaining that their name doesn't show
up on their certificates. I respond to them with the following instructions:
"We pull all your biographical information directly from GitHub. So you just
need to add your name to your GitHub account. Then go back to your Free Code
Camp code portfolio and click the "update my profile from GitHub" button. Then
your name will appear on your certificate.
Instead of having to answer these emails, if a camper doesn't have a name, we
could just put a short message like this right on their certificate where
there name would normally go. I propose the following copy for this, which is
short enough to avoid an ugly line wrap:
"Add name on GitHub then update FCC"
You'll do this in boot/user.js in the showCert function.
