Question: "Consider a scenario where an application is designed to log user actions for auditing purposes. An attacker is attempting to exploit improper output neutralization for logs by injecting malicious content. As a security expert, you are tasked with mitigating this risk. Which of the following approaches would be most effective in preventing log forging vulnerabilities?"
 "A": "Implement strict input validation by allowing only a predefined list of acceptable inputs and rejecting any input that does not conform to these specifications."
 "B": "Allow all inputs without validation and rely on the downstream logging component to correctly interpret and sanitize the inputs."
 "C": "Encode all output using a common encoding format like UTF-8 before logging, and ensure that the downstream logging component is compatible with this encoding."
 "D": "Store raw user input directly in the logs without any validation or encoding, as this would ensure an accurate audit trail."
Answer: AC
