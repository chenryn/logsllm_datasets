## Introduction
- **Role**: Research Lead for the Cyber Security Business Unit at PwC UK.
- **Experience**: Member of the Ethical Hacking team, PhD student at UCL, and former technical R&D in LEA.
- **Background**: First degree in English Literature and Language.

## Why This Talk?
- Based on research conducted at UCL.
- Interest in side-channel attacks, particularly those involving human behavior.
- Previous work in forensic linguistics.
- The talk aims to explore how typing patterns can be used to identify individuals.

## Agenda
1. What is Attribution?
2. Problems with Attribution
3. Case Linkage Analysis
4. Experimentation
5. Results
6. Implications
7. Summary

## What is Attribution?
- **Definition**: The process of identifying an attacker's location, country, or organization.
- **Benefits**: Deter future attacks, improve defenses, and disrupt ongoing attacks.
- **Types**:
  - **Atomic**: Direct identifiers (e.g., IP addresses).
  - **Computed**: Derived from multiple data points (e.g., correlating activity with time zones).
  - **Behavioral**: Based on the attacker's actions and patterns.

- Rid and Buchanan, 2014
- Mejia, 2014
- Clark and Landau, 2011

## Benefits of Attribution
- **Deterrence**: Discouraging future attacks.
- **Improved Defenses**: Enhancing security measures.
- **Disruption**: Interrupting and stopping ongoing attacks.
- **Efficacy**: Questions remain about the actual deterrence effect (Guitton, 2012).

## Types of Attribution
- **Hutchins et al., 2011**:
  - **Atomic**: Most effective but easiest to spoof.
  - **Computed**: Changes in malware make it challenging.
  - **Behavioral**: Less tangible benefits but useful for understanding attack patterns.

## Problems with Attribution
- **Hiding Atomic Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Easy to resolve but also easy to obfuscate.
- **Issues with Computed IOCs**: Changes in malware and other factors complicate identification.
- **Lack of Tangible Benefits from Behavioral IOCs**: More focused on understanding rather than direct attribution.

### Methods
- Correlating activity with office hours in time zones (Rid & Buchanan, 2014; CloudHopper, 2017).
- Deanonymizing developers through artifacts (Caliskan et al., 2015).
- Similar malware capabilities (Moran & Bennett, 2013; Symantec, 2011).
- Distinguishing humans vs. bots (Filippoupolitis et al., 2014).

## Behavioral Profiling
- **Focus**: Understanding who hacks and why.
- **Aspects**:
  - Motivation, skills, and attack behaviors (Landreth, 1985).
  - Attitudes and culture (Chiesa et al., 2008; Watters et al., 2012).
  - Psychological profiles (Shaw et al., 1998).

## Attack Profiling
- **Humans vs. Bots**:
  - Skill, education, typing speed, and mistakes (Filippoupolitis et al., 2014).
  - Skill level (Salles-Loustau et al., 2011).
  - Specific actions undertaken (Ramsbrock et al., 2007).

## The Problem
- **Profiling Attackers**: Interesting but limited to individual cases.
- **Next Step**: Comparing profiles to determine similarity.
- **Unexplored Area**: Extent of similarity between attacker profiles.

## Case Linkage Analysis
- **Idea**: Discovering case linkage analysis.
- **Benefits**: Linking offenses, focused resource allocation, and better success rates.
- **Methodology**: Using behavioral evidence to link crimes.
- **References**: Woodhams & Grant, 2006.

### Benefits of Linking Offenses
- **Attribution**: Solving previously unsolved crimes.
- **Resource Allocation**: Investigating offenses under one grouping.
- **Evidentiary Value**: Growing database of offenses.
- **Specialist Crimes**: More accurate for specific types of crimes.

### Best Method for Linking
- **Physical Evidence**: DNA, fingerprints, etc.
- **Challenges**: Absence or inconclusiveness, not applicable to cyber attacks.
- **Forensic Artifacts**: Not always unique, time-consuming, and expensive.

### What Case Linkage Analysis Is
- **Behavioral Evidence**: Actions during the commission of an offense.
- **Domains**: Granular crime behaviors classified into categories.
- **Comparison**: Linked and unlinked pairs of offenses.
- **Similarity Determination**: Statistical inferences about the degree of similarity.

### What Case Linkage Analysis Isn’t
- **Not Offender Profiling**: Making inferences about the offender based on consistent behavior.
- **Statistical Inferences**: Comparing common behaviors to determine similarity.

### Key Assumptions
- **Behavioral Consistency**: Offenders display similar behaviors across crimes.
- **Behavioral Distinctiveness**: Offender’s style is unique and distinguishable from others.
- **CAPS System**: Cognitive-affective personality system (Mischel & Shoda, 1995; Mischel, 1999).

### Other Fields
- **Forensic Linguistics**: Word and sentence length, slang, typos, syntax, idiolect, etc.
- **Biometrics**: Typing speed, typos, and typing habits.

### Effectiveness
- **Consensus**: Generally effective, with observed variance significantly smaller in linked crimes.
- **Evidence**: Cross-situational consistency in both criminal and non-criminal behaviors (Tonkin et al., 2008).

## Methodology
- **Separate Behaviors into Domains**.
- **Calculate Similarity Coefficient**.
- **Logistic Regression Model**.
- **Determine Optimal Combination of Domains**.
- **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves**.

### Example
- **Scenario**: Two burglaries, A and B.
- **Objective**: Determine if the same offender committed both.
- **Dependent Variable**: Dichotomous (Y/N) question.
- **Contribution**: Identify which variables contribute more to the similarity.

- **Granular Behaviors**: Categorized into domains.
