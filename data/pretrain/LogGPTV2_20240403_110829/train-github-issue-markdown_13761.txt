I have noticed that running `Base.runtests(["core"])` fails, but running `make
test-core` does not. This is reproducible on linux x86_64 and macOS aarch64 on
both latest `master` (`63f5b8a` as of this writing) and `v1.7.0`, but not on
anything earlier, like `1.6.4`.
These three tests fail:
julia/test/core.jl
Lines 3521 to 3523 in 63f5b8a
|  @test_throws ErrorException Vararg{Int, N} where N:Integer  
Intriguingly, when input directly into the REPL of a new session, these
statements do not cause a problem on 1.6.4 or 1.7, although they do give
different answers:
    $ julia-1.7.0 -E 'Vararg{Int, N} where N<:T where T'
    Vararg{Int64}
    $ julia-1.6.4 -E 'Vararg{Int, N} where N<:T where T'
    Vararg{Int64, N} where {T, N<:T}
I'm not sure what changes occur to the running Julia session when running
`make test-core`. Is it expected that, at all times, these tests should cause
errors?
