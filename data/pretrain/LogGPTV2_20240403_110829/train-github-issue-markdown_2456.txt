    Before filing a bug, please check whether it has been fixed since the
    latest release. Search the issue tracker and check that you're running the
    latest version of Go:
    Run "go version" and compare against
    http://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html  If a newer version of Go exists,
    install it and retry what you did to reproduce the problem.
    Thanks.
    What does 'go version' print?
    go version go1.2.2 darwin/amd64
    What steps reproduce the problem?
    If possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.
    http://play.golang.org/p/AJ1eY19nWS
    What happened?
    This error is printed when building: "main.main: doasm: notfound from=75 to=75
    (4) CMPQ    $0,$0"
    What should have happened instead?
    It should compile and link successfully.
    Please provide any additional information below.
    With go release version mentioned above, "go tool 6g foo.go" succeeds, and
    then "go tool 6l foo.6" produces the error above. With tip (go version devel
    +b5eda189b974 Thu Feb 20 16:18:05 2014 -0500 darwin/amd64), "go tool 6g
    foo.go" fails with basically the same error, though formatted slightly differently:
        "foo.go:5: doasm: notfound from=75 to=75 00000 (foo.go:4)  CMPQ    $0,$0"
