Okay, first, I want to say, I'm not sure if this is equivalent to
#872
But it would be nice to be able to completely hide the window border that
looks like

What wasn't mentioned in the other topic was that even if we turn off
ShowTabsInTitlebar, we still have a small border (which I'm still not a fan
of):

The issue I cited was closed without a clear (to me) resolution, and it's not
clear if this feature might be implemented in a future version of Windows or
if it's been completely abandoned, so if this is a duplicate, before closing
it, could one of the devs clarify the situation?
What would be nice is maybe a hotkey to just hide the entire non-client area.
Support for this would also move toward quake-terminal support (which I guess
isn't planned for 1.0).
