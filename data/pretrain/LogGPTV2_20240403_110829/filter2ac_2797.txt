**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

### Windows
- **Best Practice:** Avoid adding user or administrative domain accounts to local administrator groups across multiple systems unless they are strictly controlled. This practice is often equivalent to having a local administrator account with the same password on all systems, which significantly increases security risks.
- **Recommendation:** Adhere to best practices for the design and administration of an enterprise network. Limit the use of privileged accounts across different administrative tiers to minimize potential vulnerabilities.

### Linux
- **Security Consideration:** Extracting passwords from memory requires root privileges. 
- **Best Practice:** Implement strict access controls for privileged accounts to prevent malicious programs from accessing sensitive regions of memory.
