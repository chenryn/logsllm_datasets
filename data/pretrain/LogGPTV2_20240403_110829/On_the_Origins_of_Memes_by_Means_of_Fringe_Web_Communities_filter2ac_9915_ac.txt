Fig. 3(a), this varies considerably (note log-scale on x-axis). KYM
entries have as few as 1 and as many as 8K images, with an average
of 45 and a median of 9 images. Larger values may be related to
the meme’s popularity, but also to the “diversity” of image variants
it generates. Upon manual inspection, we find that the presence
of a large number of images for the same meme happens either
when images are visually very similar to each other (e.g., Smug
Frog images within the two clusters in Fig. 1), or if there are actually
remarkably different variants of the same meme (e.g., images in
‘cluster 1’ vs. images in ‘cluster N’ in the same figure). We also
note that the distribution varies according to the category: e.g.,
higher-level concepts like cultures include more images than more
specific entries like memes.
We then analyze the origin of each entry: see Fig. 3(b). Note that
a large portion of the memes (28%) have an unknown origin, while
YouTube, 4chan, and Twitter are the most popular platforms with,
respectively, 21%, 12%, and 11%, followed by Tumblr and Reddit
with 8% and 7%. This confirms our intuition that 4chan, Twitter,
and Reddit, which are among our data sources, play an important
role in the generation and dissemination of memes. As mentioned,
we do not currently study video memes originating from YouTube,
due to the inherent complexity of video-processing tasks as well
as scalability issues. However, a large portion of YouTube memes

actually end up being morphed into image-based memes (see, e.g.,
the Overly Attached Girlfriend meme [39]).
3.3 Running the pipeline on our datasets
For all four Web communities (Twitter, Reddit, /pol/, and Gab),
we perform Step 1 of the pipeline (Fig. 2), using the ImageHash
library [2]. We then perform Steps 2-3 (i.e., pairwise comparisons
between all images and clustering), for all the images from /pol/,
The_Donald subreddit, and Gab, as we treat them as fringe Web
communities. Note that, we exclude mainstream communities like
the rest of Reddit and Twitter as our main goal is to obtain clusters
of memes from fringe Web communities and later characterize all
communities by means of the clusters. Next, we go through Steps
4-5 using all the images obtained from meme annotation websites
(specifically, Know Your Meme, see Sec. 3.2) and the medoid of each
cluster from /pol/, The_Donald, and Gab. Finally, Steps 6-7 use all
the pHashes obtained from Twitter, Reddit (all subreddits), /pol/,
and Gab to find posts with images matching the annotated clusters.
This is an integral part of our process as it allows to characterize
and study mainstream Web communities not used for clustering
(i.e., Twitter and Reddit).
4 ANALYSIS
In this section, we present a cluster-based measurement of memes
as well as an analysis of a few Web communities from the “perspec-
tive” of memes. We measure the prevalence of memes across the
clusters obtained from fringe communities: /pol/, The_Donald sub-
reddit (T_D), and Gab. We also use the distance metric introduced
in Eq. 1 to perform a cross-community analysis. Then, we group clus-
ters into broad, but related, categories to gain a macro-perspective
understanding of larger communities, including mainstream ones
like Reddit and Twitter.
4.1 Cluster-based Analysis
We start by analyzing the 12.6K annotated clusters consisting of
268K images from /pol/, The_Donald, and Gab (Step 5 in Fig. 2). We
do so to understand the diversity of memes in each Web commu-
nity, as well as the interplay between variants of memes. We then
evaluate how clusters can be grouped into higher structures using
hierarchical clustering and graph visualization techniques.
4.1.1 Clusters. Statistics. In Table 2, we report some basic statis-
tics of the clusters obtained for each Web community. A relatively
high percentage of images (63%–69%) are not clustered, i.e., are
labeled as noise. While in DBSCAN “noise” is just an instance that
does not fit in any cluster (more specifically, there are less than 5
images with perceptual distance ≤ 8 from that particular instance),
we note that this likely happens as these images are not memes,
(a)

entry (b).
but rather “one-off images.” For example, on /pol/ there is a large
number of pictures of random people taken from various social
media platforms.
Overall, we have 2.1M images in 63.9K clusters: 38K clusters for
/pol/, 21K for The_Donald, and 3K for Gab. 12.6K of these clusters
are successfully annotated using the KYM data: 9.2K from /pol/
(142K images), 2.9K from The_Donald (121K images), and 447 from
Gab (4.5K images). Examples of clusters are reported in Appendix D
of the extended version of the paper [73]. As for the un-annotated
clusters, manual inspection confirms that many include miscella-
neous images unrelated to memes, e.g., similar screenshots of social
networks posts (recall that we only filter out screenshots from the
KYM image galleries), images captured from video games, etc.
KYM entries per cluster. Each cluster may receive multiple anno-
tations, depending on the KYM entries that have at least one image
matching that cluster’s medoid. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the majority
of the annotated clusters (74% for /pol/, 70% for The_Donald, and
58% for Gab) only have a single matching KYM entry. However,
a few clusters have a large number of matching entries, e.g., the
one matching the Conspiracy Keanu meme [28] is annotated by
126 KYM entries (primarily, other memes that add text in an image
associated with that meme). This highlights that memes do overlap
and that some are highly influenced by other ones.
Clusters per KYM entry. We also look at the number of clusters
annotated by the same KYM entry. Fig. 4(b) plots the CDF of the
number of clusters per entry. About 40% only annotate a single
/pol/ cluster, while 34% and 20% of the entries annotate a single
The_Donald and a single Gab cluster, respectively. We also find
that a small number of entries are associated to a large number of
clusters: for example, the Happy Merchant meme [32] annotates
124 different clusters on /pol/. This highlights the diverse nature
of memes, i.e., memes are mixed and matched, not unlike the way
that genetic traits are combined in biological reproduction.
Top KYM entries. Because the majority of clusters match only
one or two KYM entries (Fig. 4(a)), we simplify things by giving
all clusters a representative annotation based on the most prevalent
annotation given to the medoid, and, in the case of ties the average
distance between all matches (see Sec. 2.2). Thus, in the rest of the
paper, we report our findings based on the representative annotation
for each cluster.
In Table 3, we report the top 20 KYM entries with respect to
the number of clusters they annotate. These cover 17%, 23%, and
27% of the clusters in /pol/, The_Donald, and Gab, respectively,
