I've reported this problem before on discourse but apparently I didn't file an
issue, and the fix was not included in 0.5.1. There is a performance bug in
0.5.0, and also now in 0.5.1, with arrays that have 6 or more subscripts. The
bug is fixed in 0.4.7 and was also fixed in 0.6.0 last time I checked. Here is
a sample.
