**User:** The installation directory for Python is "D:\Python2.7". Every time I open IDLE and navigate to the "File" menu, then select "Open," the default directory is also "D:\Python2.7." As a result, I have to manually change the directory to my desired location each time. Is there a way to permanently change this default directory? Can it be done through a configuration file or by modifying an environment variable?

I tried adding `PYTHONPATH` to the environment variables, but it did not resolve the issue. Additionally, I imported the `os` module and used `os.chdir()`, but this only changes the working directory within the script, not the default directory in IDLE.

**Assistant:** If you are launching IDLE from a Windows shortcut, you can modify the default starting directory as follows:

1. Right-click on the IDLE shortcut.
2. Select "Properties."
3. In the "Start in" field, enter the directory you want to use as the default.
4. Click "OK" to save the changes.

This will set the specified directory as the default whenever you open IDLE using that shortcut.
