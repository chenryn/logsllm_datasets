User: The installation directory is "d:\python2.7", and every time I open IDLE and click on menu File and Open item, the default directory is also "d:\python2.7". So I have to change the directory to where I want.
Is there any way I can change it? Using configuration file or changing environment variable? 
I tried to add PYTHONPATH in environment variable, but it doesn't work.
I also import os, and use os.chdir(), but it only changes the working directory, not what I want.
Thank you.
Assistant: If you're running IDLE from a Windows shortcut, you can just right-click on the shortcut, choose "Properties", and change the field "Start in" to any directory you like.
