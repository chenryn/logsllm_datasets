**Title: Blackhat: US-18 - Information Security Philosophies for a Corrupt Economy**

Most systematic approaches to information security are developed by contributors from stable nation-states, where the underlying assumption is that the environment is trustworthy and the stakeholders are well-intentioned. However, this talk delves into the realities of corruption, drawing on real-life anecdotes from interviews with actual criminals and victims. It highlights the significant challenges and differences in implementing information security in both developed and developing countries, where corruption can undermine security efforts and even turn those tasked with safeguarding systems into adversaries.

The discussion will also cover the typical obstacles faced when working in challenging environments, and how these conditions affect us as security professionals. First-hand accounts from individuals involved in such situations will be shared, along with practical strategies to combat corruption.

A basic understanding of threat modeling and a slightly dark sense of humor will enhance your experience of this talk.
