**Abstract:**
Modern IT systems are becoming increasingly large and complex, making human supervision more challenging. Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) has emerged as a solution to address these challenges through the integration of AI and Big Data. However, existing AIOps contributions are scattered, unorganized, and lack a common terminology, which hinders their discovery and comparison. This study conducts an in-depth mapping to collect and organize the numerous AIOps contributions into a unified reference index. We develop an AIOps taxonomy to provide a foundation for future research and facilitate efficient comparison of papers addressing similar problems. Our analysis includes temporal trends and categorizes AIOps contributions based on the choice of algorithms, data sources, and target components. The results indicate a recent and growing interest in AIOps, particularly in contributions related to failure-related tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis.

**Keywords:** AIOps, Operations & Maintenance, Artificial Intelligence

## 1. Introduction

Modern society is increasingly dependent on large-scale IT infrastructures. Simultaneously, the latest IT challenges demand higher levels of reliability and efficiency from computer systems. The significant increase in size and complexity of these systems makes it difficult for IT operators to perform tedious administrative tasks manually. This has led to a growing interest in self-managing and autonomic computing systems to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of IT services. While many static algorithmic solutions have been proposed, they often fall short in terms of adaptiveness and scalability. The presence of large, diverse data volumes motivates the investigation of intelligent learning systems capable of adapting to new observations and situations.

Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) explores the use of AI for managing and improving IT services. AIOps leverages Machine Learning, Big Data, and analytic technologies to monitor computer infrastructures and provide proactive insights and recommendations. This helps in reducing failures, improving mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR), and allocating computing resources efficiently. AIOps offers a wide and diverse set of tools for various applications, ranging from efficient resource management and scheduling to complex failure management tasks such as failure prediction, anomaly detection, and remediation. However, being a recent and interdisciplinary field, AIOps remains largely unstructured. Existing contributions are scattered across different conferences and use varying terminologies, making it difficult to search and collect relevant papers. Some previous systematic works focus only on specific tasks or subareas within AIOps, highlighting the need for a comprehensive and updated study of AIOps contributions.

In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of AIOps to address these limitations. We identified and extracted over 1,000 AIOps contributions through a systematic mapping study, enabling us to identify common trends, problems, and tools. First, we describe the methodology followed in our mapping study (Section 2), including our planning choices regarding problem definition, search, selection, and mapping. Next, we present and discuss the results of our study, including the most common topics, data sources, and target components (Section 3). Finally, Section 4 summarizes the outcomes and conclusions of this work.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Systematic Mapping Studies

A systematic mapping study (SMS) is a widely adopted research methodology in many fields, including software engineering. The primary goal of an SMS is to provide an overview of a specific research area, gather a set of related papers, and identify trends within that area. Relevant papers are collected using predefined search and selection techniques, and trends are identified using categorization techniques across different aspects of the papers, such as topic or contribution type. We chose to conduct an SMS because we are interested in gathering contributions and obtaining statistical insights about AIOps, such as the distribution of works in different subareas and the presence of temporal trends for particular topics. SMSs have also been shown to enhance the effectiveness of follow-up systematic literature reviews. To this end, we used our systematic mapping study to collect references for a separate survey on failure management in AIOps.

### 2.2 Planning

According to the step outline followed in [34], a systematic mapping study consists of:

- **Formulation:** Express the goals of the study through research questions and clearly define the scope of investigation.
- **Search:** Define strategies to obtain a sufficient number of papers within the scope of investigation. This includes selecting one or more search strategies (e.g., database search, manual search, reference search).
- **Selection (or Screening):** Define and apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to identify relevant papers from the search results.
- **Data Extraction and Mapping:** Gather the information required to map the selected papers into predefined categorization schemes. Results are then presented in graphical form, such as histograms or bubble plots.

The following sections detail and justify our choices for these four steps in our AIOps systematic mapping study.

### 2.3 Formulation

The main goal of this mapping study is to identify the extent of past research in AIOps. Specifically, we aim to identify a representative set of AIOps contributions that can be grouped based on the similarity of goals, employed data sources, and target system components. We also seek to understand the relative distribution of publications within these categories and the temporal implications involved. Our research questions are:

- **RQ1:** What categories can be observed while classifying AIOps contributions in scientific literature?
- **RQ2:** What is the distribution of papers in such categories?
- **RQ3:** Which temporal trends can be observed for the field of AIOps?

In terms of scope, we define AIOps as the union of goals and problems in IT Operations when addressed with AI techniques. To avoid ambiguity, we adopt an inclusive convention where AI encompasses both data-driven approaches (e.g., Machine Learning and data mining) and goal-based approaches (e.g., reasoning, search, and optimization). However, we primarily focus on the first category due to its stronger presence and connection to AIOps methodologies (e.g., data collection).

### 2.4 Search and Selection

#### Selection Criteria

We start by illustrating the selection principles to clarify the discussion of our result collection strategy, which includes both search and selection. In terms of inclusion criteria, we define only one relevance criterion based on the main topic of the document. Following our scoping considerations, this inclusion criterion comprises two necessary conditions:

- **AI Methods:** The document must reference one or more AI methods. These mentions can be part of the implementation or as part of its discussion/analysis (e.g., in a survey). Any mention of AI algorithms used by others (i.e., mentioned in the related work section or as baseline comparisons) that is not the focus of the document is not considered valid.
- **IT System Management:** The document must apply its concepts to some form of IT system management. We exclude papers with no specific target domain or with a target domain outside of IT Operations.

In terms of exclusion criteria, we define the following rules:

- The language of the document is not English.
- The document is not accessible online.
- The document does not belong to the following categories: scientific article (conference paper, journal article), book, white paper.
- The main topic of the document is one of the following: cybersecurity, industrial process control, cyber-physical systems, and optical sensor networks.

For survey and review papers, we consider them relevant during our mapping study but exclude them from our final result set, as they are useful for finding other connected works through references but do not constitute novel contributions to the field.

#### Database Search

Database search is the first and most important step in our search process, as it aims to provide the highest number of results and perform an initial screening of irrelevant papers. We perform the database search in three steps: keywording, query construction, and result polling. For keywording, we use the PICO technique presented in [34] to derive sets of keywords for AI and IT Operations. The keywords are listed in Table 1.

| **AI Keywords** | **IT Operations Keywords** |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| AI OR artificial intelligence | DevOps OR site reliability engineering OR SRE OR IT operations |
| classification | cloud computing OR cloud |
| clustering | DL OR deep learning |
| logistic regression | fault detection OR failure detection |
| regression | fault localization OR failure localization |
| supervised OR unsupervised OR semi-supervised OR reinforcement AND learning | inference OR logic OR reasoning |
| support vector machine OR SVM | fault prediction OR failure prediction |
| tree OR tree-based OR trees OR forest | fault prevention OR failure prevention |
| bayesian network OR neural network | log OR logs OR log analysis |
| hidden markov model OR gaussian mixture model | metrics OR KPI OR key performance indicator |
| data center management | remediation OR recovery |
| root cause analysis | service desk automation |
| tracing OR trace OR traces | |

Following our scoping considerations, we construct queries to return results where both AI and IT Operations are present. We apply logical conjunctions across all combinations of the two keyword sets (e.g., "logistic regression" AND "cloud computing"). This ensures precision in our search results. For keywords with synonyms and abbreviations, we allow all equivalent expressions via OR disjunction. We also perform general search queries related to the topic as a whole (e.g., "AIOps"). Finally, we group some queries with common terms to reduce the number of queries.

We selected three online search databases appropriate for our scope of investigation: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and arXiv. For each query, we restrict our analysis to the top 2,000 results returned. We aggregate results from all searches into one large set of papers, removing duplicates and annotating each item with corresponding search metadata (e.g., number of hits, index position in corresponding searches). The result from this step consists of 83,817 unique articles. For each item, we collect the title, authors, year, publication venue, contribution type, and citation count (from Google Scholar).
