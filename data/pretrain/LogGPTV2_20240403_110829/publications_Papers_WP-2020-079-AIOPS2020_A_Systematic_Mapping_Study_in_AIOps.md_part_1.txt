1 Introduction
Modern society is increasingly dependent on large-scale IT infrastructures. At
thesametime,thelatestITchallengesimposehigherlevelsofreliabilityandeffi-
ciencyoncomputersystems.Becauseofthelargeincreaseinsizeandcomplexity
of these systems, IT operators are increasingly challenged while performing te-
dious administration tasks manually. This has sparked in recent years much
interest towards the study of self-managing and autonomic computing systems
to improve efficiency and responsiveness of IT services. While many static al-
gorithmic solutions have been proposed, these automated solutions often show
limitations in terms of adaptiveness and scalability. The presence of large data
volumesindifferentmodalitiesmotivatestheinvestigationofintelligentlearning
systems, able to adapt their behavior to new observations and situations.
Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) investigates the use of Ar-
tificial Intelligence (AI) for the management and improvement of IT services.

resourcesefficiently[3].AIOpsoffersawide,diversesetoftoolsforseveralappli-
cations, from efficient resource management and scheduling to complex failure
management tasks such as failure prediction, anomaly detection and remedia-
tion [13,23]. However, being a recent and cross-disciplinary field, AIOps is still
a largely unstructured research area. The existing contributions are scattered
across different conferences and apply different terminology conventions. More-
over, the high number of application areas renders the search and collection of
relevant papers difficult. Some previous systematic works only treat single tasks
or subareas inside AIOps [20,31]. This motivates the need for a complete and
updated study of AIOps contributions.

a systematic mapping study, enabling us to delineate common trends, problems

2 Methodology
2.1 Systematic Mapping Studies
Asystematicmappingstudy(SMS)isaresearchmethodologywidelyadoptedin
many research areas, including software engineering [34]. The ultimate goal of a
SMSistoprovideanoverviewofaspecificresearcharea,toobtainasetofrelated
papers and to delineate trends present inside such area. Relevant papers are
collected via predefined search and selection techniques and research trends are
identifiedusingcategorizationtechniquesacrossdifferentaspectsoftheidentified
papers,e.g.topicorcontributiontype.WechoosetoperformaSMSbecausewe
areinterestedingatheringcontributionsandobtainingstatisticalinsightsabout
AIOps, such as the distribution of works in different subareas and the presence
of temporal trends for particular topics. SMSs have also been shown to increase
the effectiveness of follow-up systematic literature reviews [34]. To this end, we
have also used our systematic mapping study to collect references for a survey
on failure management in AIOps separately published.
2.2 Planning
According to the step outline followed in [34], a systematic mapping study is
composed of:
– Formulation,i.e.expressthegoalsintendedforthestudythroughresearch
questions. Equally important is to clearly define the scope of investigation;
– Search, i.e. define strategies to obtain a sufficiently high number of papers
withinthescopeofinvestigation.Thiscomprisestheselectionofoneormore
search strategies (database search, manual search, reference search, etc.);

– Selection (or screening), i.e. define and apply a set of inclusion/exclusion
criteria for identifying relevant papers inside the search result set;
– Data Extraction and Mapping, i.e. gather the information required to
map the selected papers into predefined categorization scheme(s). Finally,
results are presented in graphical form, such as histograms or bubble plots.
The next sections illustrate and motivate our choices regarding these four steps
for our systematic mapping study in AIOps.
2.3 Formulation
The main goal of this mapping study is to identify the extent of past research
in AIOps. In particular, we would like to identify a representative set of AIOps
contributions which can be grouped based on the similarity of goals, employed
data sources and target system components. We also wish to understand the
relative distribution of publications within these categories and the temporal
implications involved. Formally, we articulate the following research questions:
RQ1. What categories can be observed while classifying AIOps con-
tributions in scientific literature?
RQ2. What is the distribution of papers in such categories?
RQ3. Which temporal trends can be observed for the field of AIOps?
In terms of scope, we express the boundaries of AIOps as the union of goals
and problems in IT Operations when dealt with AI techniques. To circumvent
ambiguity about the term AI, we adopt an inclusive convention where we con-
sider AI both date-driven approaches, such as Machine Learning and data min-
ing,aswellasgoal-basedapproaches,suchasreasoning,searchandoptimization
approaches.However,wemostlyconcentrateoureffortsonthefirstcategorydue
to its stronger presence and connection to AIOps methodologies (e.g. data col-
lection).
2.4 Search and Selection
Selection Criteria We start illustrating the selection principles beforehand,
so that the discussion will appear clearer when we describe our result collec-
tion strategy, composed of search and selection altogether. In terms of inclusion
criteria, we define only one relevance criterion, based on the main topic of the
document. Following from our discussion on scoping such inclusion criterion
comprises two necessary conditions:
– ThedocumentreferencesoneormoreAImethods.Thesementionscaneither
be part of the implementation or as part of its discussion/analysis (e.g. in a
survey). Any mention to AI algorithms employed by others (i.e. mentioned
intherelatedworksectionorasbaselinecomparison)thatisnotstrictlythe
focus of the document, is not considered valid;
– The document applies its concepts to some kind of IT system management.
We therefore exclude papers with no specific target domain or with a target
domain outside of IT Operations.
In terms of exclusion criteria, we define the following as exclusion rules:
– The language of the document is not English;

For the special case of survey and review papers, we consider them relevant as
long while carrying out our mapping study, but we then exclude them from our
finalresultset,asthesearticlesareusefultofindotherconnectedworksthrough
references, but they do not constitute novel contributions to the field.
Database Search For the search process, database search represents the first
andmostimportantstep,asitaimstoprovidethehighestnumberofresultsand
perform an initial screening of irrelevant papers. We perform database search in
three steps: keywording, query construction and result polling. For keywording
we use the PICO technique presented in [34] to derive a set of keywords for AI
and a set of keywords for IT Operations. The keywords are listed in Table 1.
Then, following our scoping considerations, we construct queries so that they
return results where both AI and IT Operations are present. In particular, we
apply logic conjunction of keywords across all combinations of the two keyword
sets (e.g. “logistic regression” and “cloud computing”). This helps enforcing
precision in our search results. For keywords with synonyms and abbreviations,
we allow all equivalent expressions via OR disjunction. We also perform general
search queries, related to the topic as a whole (e.g. “AIOps”). Finally, we group
some queries with common terms to reduce the number of queries.
We select three online search databases that are appropriate for the scope of
investigation: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and arXiv. For each query we
restrict our analysis to the top 2000 results returned. We aggregate results from
all searches in one large set of papers, removing duplicates and annotating for
each item corresponding search metadata (e.g. number of hits, index position in
corresponding searches, etc.). The result from this step consists of 83817 unique
articles. For each item we collect the title, authors, year, publication venue,
contribution type and citation count (from Google Scholar).
