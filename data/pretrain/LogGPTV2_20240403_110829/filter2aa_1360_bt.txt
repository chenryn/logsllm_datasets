Yandex Username: https://yandex.com/search/?text="john.wilson.77089"
Searching by a person’s real name can be frustrating. If your target has a common name, it is easy to get lost in 
the results. Even a fairly unique name like mine produces almost 20 people's addresses, profiles, and telephone 
numbers. If your target is named John Smith, you have a problem. This is why I always prefer to search by email 
address when available. If you have your target's email address, you will achieve much better results at a faster 
pace. There may be thousands of John Wilsons, but there would be only one john.wilson.77089@yahoo.com. 
Searching this address within quotation marks on the major search engines is my first preference. This should 
identify web pages which include the exact details within either the content or the source code. This is the "easy 
stuff which may present false positives, but should provide immediate evidence to the exposure of the target 
account. I then typically search the username portion of the email address by itself in case it is in use within 
other providers, such as Gmail, Hotmail, Twitter, Linkedln, etc. Let's conduct an example assuming that 
"PI:EMAIL" is your target. You could place this email within quotes and execute through 
each service manually, or use the following direct search URLs to expedite the process.
The sole purpose of the service is to identify’ if an email address is active and currently being used. After entering 
an email address, you will be presented with immediate results which will identify’ if the address is valid or invalid. 
Further information will identify’ potential issues with the address. As an example, I searched 
PI:EMAIL, and received the results displayed below.
"address": "PI:EMAIL",
"username": "book",
"domain": "inteltechniques.com",
"validFormat": true,
"deliverable": true,
"fullinbox": false,
"hostExists": true,
"catchall": true,
"gravatar": false,
"disposable": false,
"free": false
When searching for a target by email address, you may find yourself receiving absolutely no results. If this 
happens, you need to consider whether the email address you are searching is valid. It is possible that the address 
was copied incorrecdy or is missing a character. There are several websites online that claim to be able to verify’ 
the validity of an email address. Most of these do not work with many of the free web-based email providers. 
One service that stands out from this crowd is TruMail.
The custom search tools presented at the end of this chapter and the next will automate this entire process. 
Next, you should verify’ and validate the target email address.
TruMail (trumail.io)
We will rely on this direct submission when I present the Email Tool at the end of the chapter.

The website presents results within a pop-up window. Fortunately, we can submit this query directly from a 
specific URL structure, as follows.
This is similar to a verification service, but with added features. Below is an actual search result, and I provide 
an explanation after each detail [within brackets]. /Is you will see, this is an impressive free search, and at the 
top of my list for ever)’ investigation.
[Email address provided]
[Likelihood to be a real email address] 
[Indications of spam or malicious use] 
[Number of online references] 
[Blocked by spam lists] 
[Known phishing activity] 
[Known recent phishing activity’] 
[Password present within data leaks] 
[Password present within recent leaks] 
[Address present within known breaches] 
[Date first seen online] 
[Date last seen online] 
[Whether domain is valid] 
[Reputation of domain] 
[Domain recently registered] 
[Days since the domain was registered] 
[Marked as spam]
[Free provider such as Gmail] 
[Disposable provider such as Mailinator] 
[Inbox able to receive mail] 
[Address is a catch-all]
[Domain possesses an email server] 
[Domain email security enabled] 
[Dmarc email security enabled] 
’twitter" [Profiles associated with email]
This indicates that the domain provided (inteltechniques.com) is configured for email and the server is active. 
Otherwise, the account is valid and everything else checks out. It also identifies whether an address is a "catchall", 
w'hich may indicate a burner account from that domain. The results confirm it is not a free webmail account nor 
a disposable temporary account. I find this tool to be more reliable than all the others when searching email 
addresses, but we should always consider alternatives.
Additional email verification options include Verify Email (verify-email.org) and Email Hippo 
(tools.verifyemailaddress.io). Both services provide minimal data, but may identify something missing from the 
previous superior options. When I searched each of my Gmail accounts, I received "OK" as a response. When 
I changed one character, I immediately received "BAD" as a result. As you validate your target addresses through
This provides detail we cannot find anywhere else. In this example, I now know that my target email address 
has been in use for at least twelve years and appears within at least one data breach. This encourages me to 
explore the breach search methods explained in a moment
Email Assumptions
Email Format (email-format.com)
Gravatar (gravatar.com)
Compromised Accounts

You may know about one address, but nor others. It can be productive to make assumptions of possible email 
addresses and use the verifiers to see if they exist. For example, if your target's name is Jay Stewart and he has 
an email address of PI:EMAIL, you should conduct additional searches for the addresses of 
PI:EMAIL, PI:EMAIL, PI:EMAIL, and others. If you already know your 
target's username, such as a Twitter handle, you should create a list of potential email addresses. If I had no 
email address or username for my target (Jay Stewart), but I knew that he worked at the Illinois Medical District 
Commission (medicaldistrict.org), I may start searching for the following email addresses.
Email Hippo, the responses appear at the bottom as a collection. Choosing the Export option allows you to 
download all results. Both services limit free daily usage by IP address and browser cookies.

These are merely assumptions of potential addresses. Most, if not all, of them do not exist and will pro', 
nothing for me. However, if I do identify an existing address, I now have a new piece of the puzzle to search. 
These addresses can be verified against the previous three tools.
This sendee is responsible for many of the small image icons that you see next to a contact in your email client 
You may notice that some incoming emails display a square image of the sender. This is configured by the 
sender, and this image is associated with any email address connected. You do not need to wait for an incoming 
message in order to see this image. While the Gravatar home page does not offer an email address search option, 
we can conduct a query directly from the following URL, replacing the email address with your target 
information. This image can then be searched with a reverse image query as explained later.
Email addresses are compromised regularly. Hacker groups often publicly post databases of email addresses and 
corresponding passwords on websites such as Pastebin. Manually searching for evidence of compromised 
accounts can get complicated, but we will tackle this later in the book. Several online sendees now aid this tvpe 
of investigation. These services provide one minimal piece of information about any email address entered. They 
disclose whether that address appears within any publicly known hacked email databases. While most will never 
disclose the owner, any email content, or passwords, they will confirm that the target's email account was 
compromised at some point. They will also identify the sendee which was targeted during the breach.

If the previous email assumption techniques were unproductive or overkill for your needs, you may want to 
consider Email Format. This website searches a provided domain name and attempts to identify the email 
structure of employee addresses. When searching medicaldistrict.org, it provided several confirmed email 
accounts under that domain and made the assumption that employee emails are formatted as first initial then 
last name. Our target would have an email address of PI:EMAIL according to the rules. I use 
this sendee to help create potential email lists from names collected from Facebook, Twitter, and other social 
networks. I can then verify my list with the sendees previously mentioned.

OOOwebhost. In approximately March 2015, the free web hosting provider OOOwebhost suffered a

major data breach that exposed almost 15 million customer records. The data was sold and traded
before OOOwebhost was alerted In October. The breach included names, email addresses and plain 
' 
text passwords.

Breaches you were pwned in
A "breach’ is an incident where data has been unintentionally exposed to the public. Using the IPasswordpassword 
manager helps you ensure all your passwords are strong and unique such that a breach of one service doesn’t put your 
other services at risk.
Searching content within the HIBP website is straight-forward. You may recall the method from the chapter 
about search tools which explained a way to query an email address through HIBP directly from a URL which 
presents text-only results. Let's revisit that technique. The following URL queries PI:EMAIL against the 
HIBP database.
This helps us in two ways. First, it confirms an email address as valid. If your suspect account is 
PI:EMAIL, and that address was compromised in a breach in 2015, you know the address is valid, it 
was active, and is at least a few years of age. Second, you know the sendees which need to be investigated. If 
PI:EMAIL was included in the Dropbox and Linkedln breaches, you should attempt to locate those 
profiles. Compromised account data is absolutely the most beneficial technique I have used within my 
investigations in the past five years. We will dive much deeper into data sets later, but let's focus on online 
sendees first. These are also good websites to check your own address in order to identify’ vulnerabilities.
This is a staple in the data breach community. This site allows entry of cither a username or email address, but 
1 find only the email option to be reliable. The result is a list and description of any public breaches which 
contain the provided email address. The descriptions are ven helpful, as they explain the npe of sendee 
associated and any details about the number of users compromised. In a test, 1 searched an old email of mine 
that was used to create several covert accounts many years prior. The result was notification that the email 
address had been compromised on six websites, including Bidy, Dropbox, Linkedln, Myspace, River City’ Media, 
and Tumblr. The data present here is voluntarily contributed to the owner of the site. Cyber thieves steal various 
credential databases and allow Have I Been Pwncd (HIBP) to confirm the legitimacy. HIBP then makes the 
content searchable and credits the thief by name. The chief can then charge more 
as HIBP has vetted the content. It's a weird game.
Now, lets compare results. Figure 15.01 displays the output from the official website. Immediately after, I 
present the text provided with this custom URL.

The results are in J SON format, which may appear like pure text within your browser. The following result was 
presented to me when I searched an email address within my own domain. They basically tell you that the email 
address queried is present within multiple database breaches, but the identity of each is not available. 1 use this 
service to simply verify an email address.
As you can see, the text version contains more details and can be easily copied and pasted into a report. Have I 
Been Pwned is an amazing tool, but it does not contain all known breaches. Some "white hat hackers eagerly 
share the data leaks and breaches which they discover in order to receive acknowledgement from the site. Once 
HIBP has verified the legitimacy and source of the data, it becomes much more valuable in the black markets. 
Many researchers have accused this website of encouraging data theft, as it can be sold for a higher amount once 
the owner has vetted the content. Many criminals who deal with stolen credentials dislike this site and its owner. 
They do not share their goods and try to keep them off of the radar of the security community. Therefore, 
must always utilize every resource possible.
This service is a bit different. They are extremely aggressive in regard to obtaining fresh database breaches. They 
possess many data sets which are not present in HIBP. However, they do not display details about accounts 
which you do not own. Our only option is general details through their free API. The following URL submits a 
query for test@email.com.
WTiile Have I Been Pwned is often considered the gold standard in regard to breached account details, we cannot 
ignore Dehashed. It takes a more aggressive approach and seeks breached databases for their own collection. 
Using the same email address provided during the previous test, I received two additional breach notifications. 
These included lesser-known breaches which had not yet publicly surfaced on HIBP. When combining results 
from both of these services, you would now know that this target email address was likely a real account (you 
received results); it had been used online since 2012 (the date of the oldest breach according to HIBP); it is 
connected to an employment-minded individual (Linkedln); and it exists in spam databases as a U.S. consumer 
(River City Media).
I believe that Have I Been Pwned and Dehashed complement each other, and one should never be searched 
without the other. This search alone often tells me more about a target email address, even if it never identifies 
the owner. Dchashed allows unlimited search for free, but will not disclose passwords without a premium 
account. They advertise the ability' to see all associated passwords for a small fee. I have tried this service in the 
past, and it worked well. However, I believe that paying a company to disclose stolen passwords might exceed 
the scope of OSINT. It may also violate your own employer's policies. Please use caution. Unfortunately, 
Dchashed now requires you to be logged into a free account in order to conduct any queries, even at a free
