### Chapter 15: Email Addresses

#### Introduction
Searching for a person by their real name can be frustrating, especially if the name is common. For example, searching for "John Smith" will likely yield numerous results, making it difficult to pinpoint the correct individual. This is why I prefer to search by email address when possible. An email address is unique, and searching for it within quotation marks on major search engines can provide immediate and accurate results.

#### Search Techniques
To conduct an effective search, you can use the following direct search URLs for major search engines:

- **Google Email**: `https://google.com/search?q="PI:EMAIL"`
- **Google Username**: `https://google.com/search?q="john.wilson.770891"`
- **Bing Email**: `https://bing.com/search?q="PI:EMAIL"`
- **Bing Username**: `https://bing.com/search?q="john.wilson.77089"`
- **Yandex Email**: `https://yandex.com/search/?text="PI:EMAIL"`
- **Yandex Username**: `https://yandex.com/search/?text="john.wilson.77089"`

#### Verifying Email Addresses

#### Additional Verification Options
- **Verify Email (verify-email.org)**
- **Email Hippo (tools.verifyemailaddress.io)**

These services provide minimal data but can still be useful in confirming the validity of an email address.

#### Email Assumptions
If you know one email address, you can make assumptions about other potential addresses and verify them using the above tools. For example, if your target's name is Jay Stewart and he has an email address of `PI:EMAIL`, you should also search for variations like `PI:EMAIL`, `PI:EMAIL`, and others.

#### Gravatar
Gravatar (gravatar.com) is responsible for the small image icons next to contacts in email clients. You can check if a Gravatar exists for an email address using the following URL:
- **URL**: `https://en.gravatar.com/site/check/PI:EMAIL`

#### Compromised Accounts
Email addresses are frequently compromised, and hacker groups often post databases of email addresses and passwords on websites like Pastebin. Several online services can help identify if an email address has been compromised:

- **Have I Been Pwned (haveibeenpwned.com)**
  - URL: `https://haveibeenpwned.com/unifiedsearch/PI:EMAIL`
  - Example Result:
    ```json
    {
      "Name": "OOOwebhost",
      "Title": "OOOwebhost",
      "Domain": "000webhost.com",
      "BreachDate": "2015-03-01",
      "AddedDate": "2015-10-26T23:35:45Z",
      "ModifiedDate": "2017-12-10T21:44:27Z",
      "PwnCount": 14936670,
      "Description": "In approximately March 2015, the free web hosting provider OOOwebhost suffered a major data breach that exposed almost 15 million customer records. The data was sold and traded before OOOwebhost was alerted in October. The breach included names, email addresses, and plain text passwords.",
      "DataClasses": ["Email addresses", "IP addresses", "Names", "Passwords"],
      "IsVerified": true,
      "IsFabricated": false,
      "IsSensitive": false,
      "IsRetired": false,
      "IsSpamList": false
    }
    ```

- **Dehashed (dehashed.com)**
  - Dehashed is more aggressive in obtaining fresh database breaches and often provides additional information not found in Have I Been Pwned.
  - URL: `https://dehashed.com/search?query=PI:EMAIL`

- **Spycloud (spycloud.com)**
  - Spycloud also offers detailed information on breached accounts.
