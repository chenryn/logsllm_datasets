In Bootstrap 3 Release Candidate 2 (BS3 RC2), the dropdowns in the navbar are displaying correctly on mobile devices. However, when a link within the dropdown is selected, the dropdown closes but does not follow the link. This issue does not occur on desktop, where the links function as expected.

In contrast, Release Candidate 1 (RC1) handled the link functionality correctly, though it had a different issue: the `navbar-inverse` class did not properly apply the inverse styling to the navbar.
