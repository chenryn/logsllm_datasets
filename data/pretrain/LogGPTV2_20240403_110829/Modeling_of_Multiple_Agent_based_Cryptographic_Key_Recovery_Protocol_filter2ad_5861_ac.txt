I
P ×T is a set of input functions (i.e., a set of input arcs
to transitions).
O P ×T is a set of output functions (i.e., a set of output
arcs from transitions).
M P ×NI is a set of markings (where, NI is a set of
data

non-negative integers).
Note that a token, representing by a big dot, in data or
message place is interpreted as availability of data which is
annotated to the place (e.g., a private-key or message is
available). A token, however, in a normal place is interpreted
as an abstract entity of control or data as in the case of
normal Petri nets.
A component or macro transition is interpreted as a function
or component such as RSA, DES, exclusive-or(
), merge,
divide, send and receive, of which execution times can be
labeled. A normal-transition is an ‘immediate transition’
(i.e., zero delayed firing timed transition) as in the case of
normal Petri nets. A normal transition is interpreted as an
AND logic of input places. For the purpose of readability of
the net, pictorial notation of elements of an ECTPN is
defined in Fig. 8.
(2) Marking and firing rule
All places are marked whenever data or a message is
available to the places by means of initialization and initial
key distribution. Note that
in some data places, which
represent a result of integrity check,
the data place is
marked only if the result of the integrity check is true. A set
of marked places is a marking set. A marking set is a state
of marked area of system which is modeled by an ECTPN.
All transitions whose input places are marked are enabled.
Any pairs of enabled transitions whose sets of input places
are overlapped are exclusively enabled.
All non-exclusively enabled transition are to be fired
concurrently.
Firing transitions all output places of the transitions are
marked after delay time annotated to the transition, and
result in a new marking set.
(3) Properties of ECTPN
An ECTPN is not a class of extended Petri net, but colored
Petri nets. An ECTPN is defined and used for the purpose of
