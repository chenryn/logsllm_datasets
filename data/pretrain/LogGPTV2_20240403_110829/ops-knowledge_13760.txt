User: How to set up scheduled tasks in Linux system? Please elaborate on the command and syntax.
Assistant: The Linux system can set up scheduled tasks through the crontab command. Crontab is a program used to execute commands or scripts at specific times. The following is a detailed description of how to set up a scheduled task in the Linux system: 1. Open the terminal, and enter crontab -e to edit the crontab file. 2. In the opened file, you can see the format with time and command as one line. The format is as follows: ``` * * * * * command to be executed - - - - - | | | | | | | | | +----- day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday = 0) | | | +------- month (1 - 12) | | +--------- day of the month (1 - 31) | +----------- hour (0 - 23) +------------- min (0 - 59) ``` Note that an asterisk (*) indicates all possible values, e.g. Asterisk, then the program will be executed every minute. 3. Define the task time and execution command as needed, for example: ``` 0 * * * * /home/usr/script.sh ``` The above command will execute the script.sh script at 0 minutes every hour. 4. Save and exit the crontab file. 5. You can use the crontab -l command to list all scheduled tasks of the current user. 6. Use the crontab -r command to delete all scheduled tasks from the crontab file. The above is a detailed description on how to set up the scheduled tasks of the Linux system. The setting of timed tasks can be easily completed through these simple steps.
