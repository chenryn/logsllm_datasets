### Analysis and Findings

The results indicate that eight websites of the Department of Defense (DoD), 23 of the Alexa Top 500, and over twelve million URLs in the HTTP Archive are served via CloudFront. Additionally, all eight DoD websites, 16 of the Alexa Top 500, and over nine million URLs in the HTTP Archive use CloudFront in combination with other HTTP implementations such as Apache HTTPD, Nginx, Amazon S3, Microsoft IIS, and Varnish. Our experiments revealed that these configurations are vulnerable to CPDoS attacks.

However, it is challenging to estimate the exact number of vulnerable websites without individually inspecting each one. The experiments were conducted using default configurations and did not account for any intermediate systems. Content providers often modify the default configuration of a cache to suit their specific needs. Real-world web applications also use other intermediate systems like load balancers or Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), which can influence the effectiveness of CPDoS attacks.

To better understand the real-world impact of CPDoS attacks, we sampled URLs from the Alexa Top 500, DoD, and HTTP Archive data sets. We identified twelve vulnerable resources within a few days, including mission-critical websites such as ethereum.org, marines.com, and nasa.gov, which use CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network (CDN). At these websites, we were able to block multiple resources, including scripts, style sheets, images, and dynamic content like the start page.

**Figures 6 and 7** in Appendix A illustrate the visual damage of a CPDoS attack. In Figure 6, an image on the start page of ethereum.org is first blocked, followed by the style sheet, and finally, an error page replaces the entire start page. Figure 7 shows the affected start page of marines.com, displaying an error page instead of the original content.

Furthermore, we successfully conducted a CPDoS attack on IKEA’s Smart Home device update files. IKEA uses CloudFront in conjunction with S3 to distribute firmware and driver updates for their wireless bulbs. Since CloudFront combined with S3 is vulnerable to HHO CPDoS attacks, an attacker can prevent IKEA’s remote control devices from fetching security patches.

These findings demonstrate that CPDoS attacks can affect both static and dynamic resources. While most vulnerable websites use CloudFront as a CDN, the impact of CPDoS attacks is not limited to CloudFront. We also found vulnerable websites using other CDNs such as Akamai and Cloudflare in conjunction with Play 1. An advanced attacker with political or financial motivations can easily identify more vulnerable resources by investigating response headers. The freely available HTTP Archive data sets via Google Big Query include millions of URLs that can be analyzed. For example, the HTTP Archive data set `httparchive.summary_requests.2018_12_15_desktop` contains over nine million URLs, many of which are highly vulnerable due to the use of CloudFront with Apache HTTPD, Nginx, Amazon S3, Microsoft IIS, and Varnish. Among these are critical websites and resources, including Amazon, dowjones.com, and Logitech, which distributes firmware via CloudFront.
