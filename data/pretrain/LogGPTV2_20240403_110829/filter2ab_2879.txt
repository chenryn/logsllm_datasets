**Title: Exploring a P2P Transient Botnet — From Discovery to Enumeration**

Botnets continue to pose a significant threat to entities and users connected to the Internet, making them a critical area of research. The power of these networks was vividly demonstrated in 2016 when the Mirai P2P botnet targeted Dyn's DNS services, causing widespread disruption and impacting major companies such as Twitter and Netflix.

In this paper, we present our study on a "Mirai-like" botnet called Rakos. Our research begins with the high-interactivity honeypot recruitment process and extends to a detailed analysis and exploitation of the botnet's command and control (C&C) protocol. We employed crawling and node-injection methods to enumerate and estimate the size of the botnet. 

Our contribution also includes a comparison between two P2P botnet exploration methods used in our research, along with an analysis of their suitability for different scenarios. Additionally, we introduce the term "transient" to describe botnets formed by malware that does not establish persistence on compromised systems, a characteristic increasingly common among modern threats to Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
