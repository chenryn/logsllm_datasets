A. PROOF SKETCH OF THEOREM 1
Since k is the number of incorrect mappings in σ ̸= σ0,
2 ≤ k ≤ n is evidently. For convenience of proof, let σk
be a DA scheme that has k incorrect mappings. Under σk,
let Vk ⊆ V be the set of incorrectly de-anonymized users5,
Ek = {ei,j|i ∈ Vk or j ∈ Vk} be the set of all possible
edges adjacent to at least one user in Vk, Eτ = {ei,j|i, j ∈
Vk, (i, j) ∈ σk, and (j, i) ∈ σk} be the set of all possible
edges corresponding to transposition mappings 6 in σk, and
E = {ei,j|1 ≤ i ̸= j ≤ n} be the set of all possible edges on
5Without of causing any confusion, we use V , V a, and
V u interchangeably since V = V a = V u.
6If both mappings (i, j) and (j, i) are in σk, then
{(i, j), (j, i)} is called a transposition mapping, i.e., two users
are incorrectly de-anonymized to each other.

we have |Vk| = k, mk =

+ k(n − k), mτ ≤ k
Now, we quantify Ψσ0 stochastically. Actually, to quan-
tify Ψσ0 , we considering the DE caused by the projection
of each edge rather than considering the mapping direct-
ly. ∀ei,j ∈ E, if it appears in E and is projected to either
Ga or Gu but not both during the edge projection process,
then according to the deﬁnition of DE, it will cause a DE
of 2. Consequently, the DE caused by ei,j satisﬁes a bino-
mial distribution B(2, 2pi,j · ℘(1 − ℘)). Furthermore, since
the projection process is i.i.d. and considering Lemma 1,
B(2, 2pi,j · ℘(1 − ℘)) =
we have Ψσ0 =

When we quantify Ψσk , we consider three cases respec-
for ∀ei,j ∈ E \ Ek, the DE caused by ei,j
tively. Case 1 :
during the projection process also satisﬁes the binomial dis-
tribution B(2, 2pi,j · ℘(1 − ℘)) since i, j ∈ V \ Vk (i.e.,
i, j are successfully de-anonymized under σk). Case 2: for
∀ei,j ∈ Ek\Eτ , it will be mapped to some other possible edge
σk(ei,j) = eσk(i),σk(j) ∈ E since ei,j /∈ Eτ and at least one of

ψt,t′ ∼ ∑
i and j is incorrectly de-anonymized under σk. Therefore, in
this case, the DE caused by ei,j during the projection process
satisﬁes binomial distribution B(2, pi,j·℘(1−pσk(i),σk(j)℘)+
for ∀ei,j ∈ Eτ , since
pσk(i),σk(j) · ℘(1 − pi,j℘)). Case 3:
it corresponds to a transposition mapping, the DE caused
by ei,j during the projection process also satisﬁes the bi-
nomial distribution B(2, 2pi,j · ℘(1 − ℘)). In summary, we

(ii) In ODA, we assume fd(i), fn(i), fK (i), fl(i), and fc(i)
are computed before the iteration starts and the time con-
sumption of computing these features is bounded by O(m +
n log n). Then, from ODA, the worst case time consump-
tion of each iteration is upper bounded by γα = γΘ(log n) =
2log γ(cid:2)(log n)
= 2Θ(log n) log γ = nΘ(1) log γ. Furthermore, the
number of iterations in ODA is Θ(n/Γ).
It follows the
worst case time complexity of ODA is O(m + n log n) +
O(nΘ(1) log γ+1 /Γ) = O(m + n log n + nΘ(1) log γ+1/Γ).
