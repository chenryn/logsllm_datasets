User: In Gnome, whenever an application is started, the mouse cursor changes from normal to an activity indicator (a spinning wheel type thing on Ubuntu). Is there any way to inform Gnome (through some system call) when the application has finished launching so that the mouse cursor returns to normal without waiting for the usual timeout of 30 seconds to occur.
I have a program in Pythong using GTK+ that is showing the icon even after launching, so what system call do I make?
Assistant: This normally happens automatically when calling the gtk.main() function
