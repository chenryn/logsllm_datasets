Using mocha, es6 and chai with vs code does not debug properly.
  1. Breakpoints in tests do not work properly, they may fire but in wrong place.
  2. Value inspector does not show local variables defined using let
  3. Debugging ES6 files, local variables do not show nor can you view values of function parameters.
Steps to Reproduce:
See attached file.
set breakpoint in calc.js.  
when breakpoint hits and you hover over it shows nothing.  
typing "value1" in the console states undefined.
set breakpoint in test that will call the calc function, a breakpoint hits but
not on breakpoint position.  
also can not see local values.
