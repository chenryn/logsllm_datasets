## Abstract
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a significant security vulnerability in the Internet, as evidenced by numerous outages, traffic hijacking, and surveillance incidents. To mitigate prefix hijacking, the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has been standardized. However, despite substantial efforts, widespread RPKI deployment remains elusive due to its manual and error-prone certification process. We argue that large-scale origin authentication requires certifying de facto ownership of IP address blocks rather than legal ownership. This approach is sufficient for protecting against harmful prefix hijacking and can be implemented without altering the existing routing infrastructure. We introduce DISCO, a system that automatically certifies de facto ownership and generates BGP-path-filtering rules at routers. We evaluate DISCO's security and deployability through live Internet experiments and simulations on empirical datasets. Our prototype, simulator, and measurement analysis code are open-sourced to ensure reproducibility.

## 1. Introduction
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) connects the organizational networks, or Autonomous Systems (ASes), that form the Internet. Despite its critical role, BGP, designed decades ago, is highly vulnerable to configuration errors and attacks, leading to major Internet outages and traffic hijacking incidents. The most common and damaging attack is prefix hijacking, where an attacker advertises IP addresses belonging to another AS, attracting and potentially manipulating the intended traffic.

To combat prefix hijacks, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) promotes the deployment of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). RPKI binds IP address blocks to their "owner" ASes using cryptographic signatures, enabling ASes to validate BGP advertisements and discard unauthorized routes. This is known as Route-Origin Validation (ROV). While RPKI is crucial for preventing prefix hijacks and more sophisticated BGP attacks, it faces significant security and deployability challenges.

### Security Concerns
RPKI suffers from human errors, with over 5% of records conflicting with legitimate BGP announcements, causing ROV-enforcing ASes to disconnect from valid destinations. Additionally, nearly a third of the records are misconfigured, leaving issuers vulnerable to prefix hijacks.

### Deployability Concerns
RPKI adoption has been slow, with few ASes using ROV, and those that do often enforce it partially. The manual and bureaucratic process of certifying IP address ownership in RPKI is a significant barrier. Moreover, the classic chicken-and-egg problem persists: both certification and ROV require nontrivial effort but are ineffective without widespread deployment.

### Certifying De Facto Ownership with DISCO
We propose certifying de facto ownership of IP addresses, which means the AS controls the addresses in BGP. DISCO, our proposed system, automates this certification, populates public repositories, and generates filtering rules for ROV. DISCO avoids the costs and risks of manual RPKI certification, does not require coordination between ASes, and maintains consistency between certificates and the BGP control plane.

DISCO is compatible with current Internet architecture, requiring only iBGP sessions between BGP routers and a local machine running a DISCO agent. Our prototype implementation and experiments on the PEERING platform, along with extensive simulations, demonstrate DISCO's readiness and significant security benefits. All code and artifacts are available for reproducibility.

## 2. RPKI and Its Adoption Challenges
RPKI associates public keys with network resources like IP prefixes. After certifying their IP prefixes, owners use private keys to authorize specific AS numbers to advertise these prefixes in BGP. Authorizations are cryptographically signed and published in public repositories, allowing other ASes to verify and filter invalid routes. The RPKI system includes:

- **Resource Certificates (RC):** Certify ownership of IP prefixes and AS numbers.
- **Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs):** Signed statements authorizing ASes to originate specific prefixes in BGP.
- **Route Origin Validation (ROV):** Filtering rules to discard or depreference BGP advertisements with invalid origins.

Despite RPKI's importance, adoption is sluggish. Most advertised prefixes are not in the system, and few ASes filter based on RPKI. Manual and hierarchical certification, along with human errors, are significant barriers. For example, if a higher-level organization lacks a resource certificate, lower-level organizations must wait, and incorrect ROAs can lead to disconnections from legitimate destinations.

### Human Error
Human errors in issuing ROAs, such as failing to authorize all origins or setting maximum prefix lengths too short, result in about 6% of BGP announcements being invalid. These errors cause ROV-enforcing ASes to discard legitimate routes, leading to disconnections. Additionally, overly permissive ROAs leave issuers vulnerable to subprefix hijacks.

### Impact on ROV Enforcement
Few ASes use ROV, and those that do often implement it partially. Network operators fear disconnection from legitimate destinations due to erroneous RPKI records. Even partial ROV requires significant expertise and ongoing monitoring.

## 3. Empirical Analysis of De Facto Ownership
We analyzed the prevalence of de facto ownership in BGP. Table I shows the number and fraction of multi-origin prefixes in November 2018 and August 2019. Figure 1 plots the distribution of prevalence values for prevalent origins across all IP blocks. Results indicate that most blocks are announced by a single origin AS, supporting the concept of de facto ownership. The fraction of individual IP addresses with a de facto owner is higher, likely due to stable ownership of large blocks and more frequent traffic engineering at finer granularities.

In conclusion, DISCO offers a practical solution to the challenges facing RPKI adoption, leading to a more secure Internet. By automating de facto ownership certification, DISCO can enhance RPKI's security and drive its deployment forward.
