User: I am trying to install cassandra version 2.2.0 and I found the compatible python version for it is 2.7.10 then I installed it. 
when I type in terminal
python2.7 --version
Python 2.7.10
but when I launch cassandra server and want to start cassandra query language shell by typing 
root@eman:/usr/local/cassandra# bin/cqlsh
bin/cqlsh: 19: bin/cqlsh: python: not found
how could I fix this issue 
thanks in advance
Assistant: For centos 8 and other similarly:

Install python 2.7
Then, prior to invoking cqlsh, run:
sudo alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python2
