I am attempting to install Apache Cassandra version 2.2.0 and have determined that the compatible Python version is 2.7.10, which I have successfully installed.

When I check the Python version in the terminal, I get the following output:
```sh
python2.7 --version
Python 2.7.10
```

However, when I launch the Cassandra server and attempt to start the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) shell by running:
```sh
root@eman:/usr/local/cassandra# bin/cqlsh
```
I encounter the following error:
```sh
bin/cqlsh: 19: bin/cqlsh: python: not found
```

How can I resolve this issue?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

**Assistant:**

For CentOS 8 and similar systems, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Install Python 2.7**:
   Ensure that Python 2.7 is installed on your system. You can do this by running:
   ```sh
   sudo dnf install python2
   ```

2. **Set Python 2.7 as the Default Python Version**:
   Before invoking `cqlsh`, set Python 2.7 as the default Python interpreter by running:
   ```sh
   sudo alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python2
   ```

This should resolve the "python: not found" error and allow you to use `cqlsh` without any issues.
