INTRODUCTION
Good afternoon Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Graham, and Members of the
Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify on the subject of botnet takedowns.
My name is Paul Vixie, and I am the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Farsight
Security, a commercial Internet security company. I am speaking today in my personal
capacity based on a long history of building and securing Internet infrastructure. I am
also here at the behest of the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working
Group (M3AAWG), a non-profit Internet security association whose international
membership is actively working to improve Internet security conditions worldwide.
I have first-hand knowledge of these matters from my experience in the Internet industry
since 1988. My background includes serving as the Chief Technology Officer for
Abovenet/MFN, an Internet Service Provider (ISP); serving as the founder and CEO of
MAPS, the first anti-spam company; and acting as the operator of the “F” DNS root name
server. I have also been involved in Internet standards work in the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) and policy development work in the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN). In addition, I served for nine years on the board of
trustees of ARIN, a company responsible for allocating Internet address resources in the
United States, Canada, and parts of the Caribbean. I presently serve on the ICANN
Security and Stability Committee (SSAC) and the ICANN Root Server System Advisory
Committee (RSSAC). I am the author of several Internet standards related to the Internet
Domain Name System (DNS) and was for eleven years the maintainer of BIND, a
popular open source DNS software system. It was for my work on DNS and BIND that I
was inducted earlier this year into the Internet Hall of Fame. My remarks today reflect
my ongoing goal of fostering improvements in botnet takedown activities by the non-
profit, for-profit, and law enforcement sectors.
II.
LESSONS FROM CONFICKER AND GHOST CLICK
I would like to start by reviewing several successful botnet takedown efforts in recent
years, since commonalities among these successes may prove instructive.
In 2008 the Conficker worm was discovered and by mid-2009 there were over ten million
infected computers participating in this botnet. I had a hands-on-keyboard role in
operating the data collection and measurement infrastructure for the takedown team1, in
which competing commercial security companies and Internet Service Providers – most
being members of M3AAWG – cooperated with each other and with the academic
research and law enforcement communities to mitigate this global threat.2
In 2011 the US Department of Justice led “Operation Ghost Click” in which a criminal
gang headquartered in Estonia was arrested and charged with wire fraud, computer
intrusion, and conspiracy. The “DNS Changer” botnet included at least 600,000 infected
computers and the mitigation task was complicated by the need to keep all of these
victims online while shutting off the criminal infrastructure the victims at this point
depended on3. My employer, Internet Systems Consortium (ISC), was the court appointed
receiver for the criminal’s Internet connectivity and resources, and I personally prepared,
installed, and operated the replacement DNS servers necessary for this takedown.
Each of these examples shows an ad-hoc public/private partnership in which trust was
established and sensitive information including strategic planning was shared without any
contractual framework. These takedowns were so-called “handshake deals” where
personal credibility, not corporate or government heft, was the glue that held it together
and made it work. And in each case the trust relationships we had formed as members of
M3AAWG were key enablers for rapid and coherent reaction.
Each of these takedowns is also an example of modern multilateralism in which intent,
competence, and merit were the guiding lights. The importance of multilateralism cannot
be overemphasized: We have found that when a single company or a single agency or
nation “goes it alone” in a takedown action, the result has usually been catastrophe. The
Internet is hugely interdependent and many rules governing its operation are unwritten.
No amount of investment or planning can guarantee good results from a unilateral
takedown action. Rather, takedown actors must work in concert and cooperation with a
like-minded team representing many crafts and perspectives, in order to maximize benefit
and minimize cost – and I refer specifically to the collateral costs borne by uninvolved
bystanders.
For example, Conficker’s second major version generated 50,000 (fifty thousand) domain
names per day that had to be laboriously blocked or registered in order to keep the control
of this botnet out of the hands of its criminal authors.  Complicating the situation, these
50,000 domain names were split up across 110 different “country code” top-level
domains that are each the property of a sovereign nation. The registries for these domains
are a mix of private and public institutions, some with national government oversight and
many without. Almost all of the 110 registries agreed to cooperate, which involved
sharing technical plans and data, as well as strategic plans and calendars.
Similarly, Operation Ghost Click required cooperation between United States and
Estonian national law enforcement agencies, as well as competing national and multi-
national ISPs and Internet security companies, and an eclectic collection of Internet
researchers and adventurers. This diverse team worked together for a single common
cause which was to protect the Internet’s end users and restore the Internet’s
infrastructure after an extraordinary breach.
Privacy deserves a special mention. In any takedown of criminal infrastructure, it is vital
that end user privacy be protected according to the greatest common denominator of the
laws or rules governing each participant in the coordinated takedown effort. So it was in
Conficker, where victim event data that showed time stamps and unique IP addresses
were only made available on a trusted, need-to-know basis. This information was only
shared either with responsible scientists for studies conforming to international ethical
guidelines for human subjects research, or with ISPs and anti-virus companies for the
narrow and specific purpose of identifying and notifying victims with the end goals of
cleanup and remediation.
Privacy protections during Operation Ghost Click were even more rigorous. The court-
appointed receiver who operated the replacement DNS servers deliberately gathered the
minimum possible data about each victim, which included the IP address, time stamp,
and port number – but no end-user DNS lookup names. Furthermore, the FBI and DOJ
team members declared themselves unwilling to hold or even receive victim specific
data, so the court-appointed receiver delivered the victim records directly to the
researcher and clean-up teams, subject to non-disclosure terms.
The ad-hoc nature of these public/private partnerships may seem like cause for concern,
but I hope you will consider the following: First, this is how the Internet was built and
how the Internet works; second, this is how criminals work with other criminals. We
would not get far by trying to solve these fast-evolving global problems with top-down
control or through government directives and rules. Bot-masters are constantly
innovating, both by devising new ways to penetrate networks and new methods of
avoiding detection. Effective response to, and remediation of, botnet attacks requires a
coordinated effort that is flexible, nimble, and capable of quickly identifying and
adapting to a dynamic and changing threat landscape.  While government has a role to
play in the takedown of criminal infrastructure such as botnets, it can be most effective
by continuing to support the participation in ad-hoc public/private partnerships by
agencies such as Justice (for example, see the FBI’s involvement in the National Cyber-
Forensics and Training Alliance [NCFTA]) and Homeland Security (for example, see the
United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team [US-CERT] and the SEI/CMU
CERT).
As another takeaway, I note that these two successful takedown exercises were both zero-
fee events – no one was asked to “pay to play.” The shared goal of protecting Internet end
users and restoring the Internet’s infrastructure requires a perfectly level playing field,
and the only money which changed hands in Operation Ghost Click was a modest
contract for technical services between the DOJ and the court-appointed receiver.
III.
EFFECTIVE ACTION REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING HOW BOTNETS
ORIGINATE AND PROLIFERATE
I’d like to take a moment to explain where botnets come from and what makes them so
attractive to criminals and also what makes them possible.
A botnet is literally a “network of robots,” where by “robot” we mean a computer that
has been captured and made to run software neither provided by the computer’s maker
nor authorized or installed by its owner. The Internet now reaches billions of end users,
as well as tens of millions of unattended “servers” including alarming growing number of
industrial control systems. Every Internet-connected device has some very complex
software including an operating system, installed applications, and ephemeral “plugins.”
The only hard and fast requirement for any of this software is “interoperability,”
meaning, it merely has to work.
