### Apache Airflow version
2.2.3
### What happened
Following #19699, we decided in February 2022 to implement a watchdog to clear
stuck-in-queued tasks by failing the DAGRun and creating a new DAGRun to start
fresh. This had the unintended side-effect to keep those tasks in queued
because we did not modify their state alongside failing the DAGRun with stuck-
in-queued tasks.
Failing a DAGRun via the API:
    res = requests.patch(
                            f"{AIRFLOW_HOST}/api/v1/dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns/{dag_run_id}",
                            headers=headers,
                            auth=auth,
                            data=json.dumps({"state": "failed"}),
                        )
does not update the state of queued tasks that are part of said DagRun, which
over time can result in the scheduler tasks slots (max_active_tasks) to fill
up and clog the Dag.

### What you think should happen instead
Failing a DAGRun via the API (via UI or otherwise) should result in queued
tasks being marked as failed (or skipped, or another state of your choice) to
avoid the buildup of queued tasks in older dags.
### How to reproduce
This is how I would attempt reproducing:
  1. Create a DAG with a max_active_tasks = 2 and with two DummyOperator tasks
  2. Create a DagRun for said DAG
  3. Queue both tasks (manually via UPDATE statements)
  4. Fail the DagRun
  5. Trigger a second DagRun
  6. Notice that tasks are scheduled, but not queued.

### Deployment
Other Docker-based deployment
### Deployment details
K8S, but I don't think it's relevant here
### Anything else
Once every 1-2 month (but YMMV depending on your max_active_tasks and how
often you fail a DAGRun with Queued tasks).  
On our side we will be updating our watchdog to also change the state of the
queued tasks to failed alongside the failing of the DAGRun. We'll most likely
upgrade to 2.3.1 in the next month or so.
