C. RQ1: How effective is PREINFER in inferring precon-
ditions compared to the related state-of-the-art approaches
(DySy and FixIt)?
The motivation behind RQ1 is to investigate the correct-
ness of the preconditions generated by PREINFER compared
to DySy and FixIt in the context of open-source projects and
benchmark suites. Furthermore, we break down each case by
the location of the assertion-containing location relative to a
loop. Table V contains the results of our evaluation. Column
#ACL shows the number of exception-throwing locations
being evaluated. For each approach, Columns #Suff, #Nece,
and #Both indicate the number of the preconditions that
are only sufﬁcient, only necessary, and both sufﬁcient and
necessary, respectively.
Across both open-source projects, PREINFER is more
effective than DySy and FixIt. For Algorithmia, PREINFER
can infer preconditions that are both sufﬁcient and necessary
in over 90% of the cases compared to 57% of the cases
for Fix-It and 56% of the cases for DySy. Table VI shows
