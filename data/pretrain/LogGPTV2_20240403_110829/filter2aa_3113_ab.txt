#### Asprox CnC Traffic
The zbot fast flux domains are also used as Command and Control (CnC) servers for the Asprox botnet. After a machine is infected via exploit kits or malicious spam attachments, it performs multiple Asprox-type callbacks to a selection of the fast flux domains, followed by click fraud traffic.

#### Pony Panel Hosted on zbot Proxy Network
During our investigation of zbot fast flux domains, we discovered a domain hosting a panel for the Pony malware (botnet). The panel was hosted on the domain `marmedladkos.com`.

- **Pony Features:**
  - Botnet controller via a panel
  - User management, logging, and statistics via a database
  - Commonly delivered via exploit kit attacks or spam email attachments

- **Table 6. Folders on Panel Site and Functionalities:**

| Path on Site | Function |
| --- | --- |
| p/Panel.zip | Controlling PHP scripts |
| p/includes/design/images/modules/* | Images for each Zeus plugin supported/tracked |
| p/includes/password_modules.php | Contains array with all software it tries to steal credentials for |
| p/includes/database.php | Contains DB schema and accessors |

#### CnC Domains and Related Malware Samples
- **Notable Top Observed Samples:**
  - Trojan[Spy]/Win32.Zbot
  - TrojanDownloader:Win32/Upatre
  - Upatre has served as a downloader for Zeus GameOver and has been recorded as being sent as an attachment in spam emails delivered by the Cutwail botnet.

### Part 2: Catching Malware IP-Style
Classical reputation systems used for network-level threat detection assign scores to IPs, BGP prefixes, and ASNs based on the volume of hosted malicious domains or IPs. In this study, our goal is to assess malicious IP ranges in certain ASNs from a new perspective. We look beyond simple counting by exploring the topology of the AS graph and examining sub-allocated ranges within BGP prefixes. This approach will help identify more networks and hosts that are already high risk or will be in the near future.

#### Previous Research
- **[5] B. Stone-Gross et al.:** Assign scores to rogue ASNs based on the amount of events involving hosts engaged in phishing, spamming, hosting drive-by download malware, or botnet traffic.
- **[6] and [7]:** Use visualization to track security incidents and malware events drawn from blacklist databases.
- **[8]:** Explores ASNs providing transit for malware ASNs.

#### ASN Graph
An Autonomous System Number (ASN) identifies every globally routable network on the Internet. An Autonomous System (AS) represents a collection of IPv4 and IPv6 network prefixes administered by the same entity and sharing a common routing policy.
