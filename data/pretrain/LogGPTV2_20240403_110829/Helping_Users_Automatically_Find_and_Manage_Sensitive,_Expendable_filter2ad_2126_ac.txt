### File-Selection Categories for the Quantitative Survey

In our quantitative survey, we categorized files into six distinct groups to ensure a diverse and representative sample. These categories were:

1. **Top Sensitive Documents**: Files containing sensitive keywords (e.g., “resume,” “passport,” “tax”) based on our qualitative interviews.
2. **Documents**: General document files.
3. **Media Files**: Images and videos.
4. **Additional Files**: Other file types not covered in the previous categories.
5. **Top Sensitive Documents from Classifier**: The top 25 documents ranked by their predicted sensitivity score.
6. **Top Sensitive Images from Classifier**: The top 25 images ranked by their predicted sensitivity score.

Table 2: File-selection categories for the quantitative survey.

We chose this diversified approach to capture a variety of file types, particularly those that our qualitative interviews suggested were potentially sensitive. Participants were shown these files in a randomized order to provide a broader perspective, especially for accounts with a skewed file distribution (e.g., one with 10 documents and 500 images).

### Round 2: Preliminary Classifier and File Selection

In Round 2, we used the data from Round 1 to train a preliminary classifier for identifying sensitive documents and images. Given that sensitive files are a minority class, we used this classifier to select only potentially sensitive documents and images. We doubled the number of selected files to 50, specifically ranking and selecting the top 25 images and 25 documents based on their predicted sensitivity scores.

### Participant Ratings and Management Preferences

For each file shown in either round, participants rated their agreement (on a five-point Likert scale) with two statements:
1. "I consider this file worth keeping" (proxy for usefulness).
2. "It would be risky, harmful, or otherwise dangerous if this file were accessed without my consent" (proxy for sensitivity).

To train binary classifiers for finding files that are not useful yet sensitive, we aggregated responses as follows:
- "Strongly disagree" and "disagree" to the first statement were considered not useful.
- "Strongly agree" and "agree" to the second statement were considered sensitive.

Participants also chose how they desired to manage each file from the following options:
- **Keep as-is**: The file remains in its current state in the cloud storage account.
- **Delete**: The file is removed from the cloud storage account.
- **Protect**: The file remains in the cloud storage account, but extra security steps are required to access its contents.

Aletheia (Section 7) aims to predict the answers to the three dimensions above. To better diagnose incorrect predictions, we also asked participants to justify each answer in free text.

### File Feature Collection

Table 3 lists the features we collected, primarily based on insights from the qualitative interviews. For example, because many interview participants mentioned personal and financial identifiers as sensitive, we used the Google Cloud Data Loss Prevention (GDLP) API to find such identifiers in files. Similarly, for specific types of images, we used the Google Vision API to collect image object labels and binary labels corresponding to the presence or absence of adult, racy, medical, and spoofed content within images.

For documents, we performed local text processing to extract features including TF-IDF vectors, topic models, word2vec vectors, and bags of words. Finally, we collected metadata about file activity and sharing. Section 7 details how Aletheia uses these features.

### Ethics

We obtained IRB approval prior to data collection and took additional steps to protect participant privacy and ensure informed, affirmative consent. Our consent page provided textual and visual examples of the type of data we collected about participants’ files. We also provided a link to our privacy policy, which detailed our data-collection process and how data was stored and used during the research process. Participants were given contact information for the IRB office and the researchers themselves. Our web apps were reviewed and verified by Google Drive and Dropbox, and our OAuth scopes were set precisely to those required for the survey. We did not retain any personally identifiable information and only stored high-level labels, counts, features, and similarity-based hashes. We also guided participants on revoking access to our tool following completion of the study.

### Quantitative Online User Study: Results

We had a total of 108 participants, 75 for Round 1 and 33 for Round 2. We collected free-text justifications alongside participants’ Likert-scale perceptions of a file’s sensitivity, its usefulness, and how the participant wished to manage the file. Thus, our dataset is rich with insights that we leveraged in designing Aletheia (Section 7). Except as noted, we aggregate results across both rounds of data collection because the distributions of responses were similar in most cases.

### Demographics and Security Hygiene

Table 4 summarizes participant demographics. 78% of participants primarily used Google Drive, and 22% used Dropbox. Participants were diverse in age and profession, including engineers, freelancers, office assistants, salespeople, and retailers. Most participants were well-established cloud storage users; 81% had used their account for 3 years or more. We observed both free and paid cloud accounts, with some participants using paid accounts provided by their work/school. All participants reported using their account for personal purposes, and 82% also used it for work/school. Participants were also reasonably frequent users of cloud storage; 22% used their account weekly, and 33% used it monthly.

Most participants were privacy-aware. Over 50% reported that they would be moderately or extremely concerned if their cloud files were stolen in a data breach. While 43% had enabled 2FA, nearly one-fourth of participants reported taking additional steps to protect their accounts, such as using strong passwords, backing up information, and monitoring for malicious activity.

### Categories of Sensitive and Useful Files

In the first section of the survey, we asked participants to provide specific examples of files in various categories of potentially sensitive or useful files. Table 5 summarizes these categories and the fraction of participants who reported having files belonging to that category in their account.

#### Files Considered Sensitive
- **Files containing PII**: More than half of participants stated that their account had files containing PII, related to bank accounts (20%), taxes (19%), resumes (11%), and IDs (11%).
- **Files containing others' PII**: While the presence of others' PII was not very common (only 31%), such PII was typically that of school/work collaborators or family members.
- **Intimate and embarrassing content**: All participants who had such files mentioned it being an image or video file, with 76% specifically referencing nudity or porn.
- **Creative content**: This was the most common category deemed sensitive, with participants mentioning school-related work (43%), art work (23%), and original writing (15%).
- **Proprietary information**: Only 23% of participants expected that they had proprietary information in their account, with 86% identifying it as work-related.

#### Files Considered Useful
- **Files for future reference**: The most common category of useful files, with 96% of participants mentioning such files. Common examples included personal photos (21%), documents for school (14%), and work (11%).
- **Sentimental value**: 87% of participants reported retaining files because of their sentimental value, such as photos of family milestones and personal memories.
- **Backup files**: Files retained as backups were most likely to consist of many different file types, including images (21%), work (16%) and school documents (8%), and miscellaneous backup items (14%).

### Participant Management Decisions

Table 6 shows the percentage of files participants labeled as sensitive and useful, divided by the reason they were selected. For files deemed useful and not sensitive, participants wanted to keep 93% of such files as-is. For files that were not useful, in the vast majority of cases, the participant wanted to delete them, regardless of their sensitivity. This result aligns with the proposed management decision, where 94% of participants wanted to delete files they considered not sensitive and not useful, and 90% wanted to delete files they considered not useful, yet sensitive.

For files deemed sensitive and useful, participants wanted to protect 58% of them. However, 39% of such files were kept as-is despite their sensitivity. Reasons for protecting sensitive and useful files included containing PII or financial information, having sentimental value, and containing intellectual property. Reasons for keeping sensitive files as-is included satisfaction with the overall level of protection of their cloud account or not considering the content to be sensitive enough to warrant additional protection.
