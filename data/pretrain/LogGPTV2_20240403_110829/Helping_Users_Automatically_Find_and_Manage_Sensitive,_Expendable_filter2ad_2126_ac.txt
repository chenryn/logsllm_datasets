keywords (e.g., “resume,” “passport,” “tax”) based on our
interviews. The other three categories were documents (#2),
media ﬁles (#3), and additional ﬁles (#4). We chose this di-
versiﬁed approach to ﬁle selection to capture a variety of
ﬁle types, particularly those that our qualitative interviews
suggested were potentially sensitive. We showed participants
these ﬁles in randomized order. In comparison to a purely ran-
dom selection, this approach provided a broader perspective,
especially for accounts with a skewed ﬁle distribution (e.g.,
one with 10 documents and 500 images).
Round 2: We used the data from Round 1 to train a prelimi-
nary classiﬁer for identifying sensitive documents and images.
Because sensitive ﬁles are a clear minority class (most ﬁles
are not sensitive), in Round 2 we used this classiﬁer to select
only potentially sensitive documents and images. We also
doubled the number of selected ﬁles to 50. In particular, we
ranked documents (#5) and all images (#6) based on their
predicted sensitivity score. We selected the top 25 images and
25 documents, showing them in randomized order.
For each ﬁle shown in either round, participants rated their
agreement (on a ﬁve-point Likert scale) that “I consider this
ﬁle worth keeping,” which was the proxy we developed for
usefulness based through our qualitative interviews. Similarly,
agreement that “it would be risky, harmful, or otherwise dan-
gerous if this ﬁle were accessed without my consent” was
our proxy for sensitivity. Because our eventual goal was to
train binary classiﬁers for ﬁnding ﬁles that are not useful, yet
sensitive, we aggregated “strongly disagree” and “disagree”
responses to the former statement as not useful and “strongly
agree” and “agree” responses to the latter as sensitive.
We also asked participants to choose how they desired to
manage the ﬁle from among the following three options:
• Keep as-is: The ﬁle will remain in your cloud storage
account in its current state.
• Delete: The ﬁle will be removed from your cloud storage
account.
• Protect: The ﬁle will remain in your cloud storage ac-
count. However, you will need to take extra security
steps to access the contents of the ﬁle.
Aletheia (Section 7) aims to predict the answers to the three
dimensions above. To better diagnose incorrect predictions,
we also asked participants to justify each answer in free text.
5.2 File Feature Collection
Table 3 lists the features we collected. We chose these features
primarily based on insights from the qualitative interviews.
Because many interview participants mentioned personal and
ﬁnancial identiﬁers as sensitive, we used the Google Cloud
Data Loss Prevention (GDLP) API [18] to ﬁnd such identiﬁers
in ﬁles. Likewise, because interview participants mentioned
concerns about speciﬁc types of images, we used the Google
Vision API to collect image object labels and binary labels
corresponding to the presence or absence of adult, racy, medi-
cal, and spoofed content within images. For documents, we
performed local text processing to extract features including
TF-IDF vectors, topic models, word2vec vectors, and bags of
words. Finally, we collected metadata about ﬁle activity and
sharing. Section 7 details how Aletheia uses these features.
5.3 Ethics
We obtained IRB approval prior to data collection. We took
additional steps to protect participant privacy and ensure in-
formed, aﬃrmative consent. Our consent page provided tex-
tual and visual examples (shown in online Appendix B [1]) of
the type of data we collected about participants’ ﬁles. In addi-
tion, to further address privacy-related concerns, we provided
participants with a link to our privacy policy, which compre-
hensively detailed our data-collection process and how data
was stored and used during the research process. Participants
were also provided with the contact information for the IRB
oﬃce and the researchers themselves. Our web apps were
reviewed and veriﬁed by Google Drive and Dropbox, and our
OAuth scopes were set precisely to those required for the
survey. We did not retain any personally identiﬁable informa-
tion, and we only stored high-level labels, counts, features,
and similarity-based hashes. We also guided participants on
revoking access to our tool following completion of the study.
6 Quantitative Online User Study: Results
We had a total of 108 participants, 75 for Round 1 and 33
for Round 2. We collected free-text justiﬁcations alongside
participants’ Likert-scale perceptions of a ﬁle’s sensitivity, its
usefulness, and how the participant wished to manage the ﬁle.
Thus, our dataset is rich with insights that we leveraged in
designing Aletheia (Section 7). Except as noted, we aggre-
gate results across both rounds of data collection because the
distributions of responses were similar in most cases.

and retailers. Participants were also well-established cloud
storage users; 81% had used their account for 3 years or more.
We observed both free and paid cloud accounts. Some par-
ticipants used paid accounts provided by their work/school.
All participants reported using their account for personal pur-
poses, and 82% also used it for work/school. Participants were
also reasonably frequent users of cloud storage; 22% of them
used their account weekly, and 33% used it monthly.
Most participants were privacy-aware. Over 50% of them
reported that they would be moderately or extremely con-
cerned if their cloud ﬁles were stolen in a data breach. While
43% had enabled 2FA, nearly one-fourth of participants re-
ported taking additional steps to protect their accounts. These
included using strong passwords, backing up information, and
monitoring for malicious activity.
6.2 Categories of Sensitive and Useful Files
In the ﬁrst section of the survey, we asked participants to
provide speciﬁc examples of ﬁles in various categories of
potentially sensitive or useful ﬁles. Table 5 summarizes these
categories and the fraction of participants who reported that
they had ﬁles belonging to that category in their account.
Files Considered Sensitive: More than half of participants
stated that their account had ﬁles containing PII. Files in this
category were related to bank accounts (20%), taxes (19%),
their resume (11%), and IDs (11%). Discussing ﬁnancial doc-
uments, one participant wrote, “When I was buying a house I
might have uploaded some of the documents I needed for the
mortgage onto the drive.” While the presence of others’ PII
was not very common (only 31%), such PII was typically that
of school/work collaborators or family members. For exam-
ple, P30 described “tax returns that would have my family’s
Social Security Numbers and addresses.”
For intimate and embarrassing content, all participants who
had such ﬁles mentioned it being an image or video ﬁle. 76%
of participants speciﬁcally referenced nudity or porn. In this
regard, one participant explained, “I have nude photos of my
wife on there, and I might have some of myself.”
Creative content was the most common category deemed
sensitive. When asked about the speciﬁc type of creative work,
participants mentioned school-related work (43%), art work
(23%), and original writing (15%). Only 23% of participants
expected that they had proprietary information in their ac-
count. Of those who did, 86% speciﬁcally identiﬁed it as work-
related. For example, one participant wrote, “There might be
an NDA there but it is old and hopefully not any more of
use.” This sentiment and the mortgage document quote above
exemplify the interplay between long-term archives and ﬁle
sensitivity. While enabling long term storage is helpful, it can
also accumulate sensitive ﬁles that are no longer useful.
Files Considered Useful: Files that were in the cloud for
future reference were the most common category of useful
ﬁles, with 96% of participants mentioning such ﬁles. Com-
mon examples in this category were personal photos (21%),
followed by documents for school (14%) and work (11%).
Among participants, 87% reported retaining ﬁles because
of their sentimental value. For example, one participant wrote,
“I have a lot of my son’s ﬁrst milestones, Christmas photos. I
have photos of my wife and me before kids. It helps me to
remember how fast time ﬂies.” Another common category was
videos and personal writings that belonged to the participant.
Files retained as backups were most likely to consist of
many diﬀerent ﬁle types. Common examples included images
(21%), work (16%) and school documents (8%), and miscella-
neous backup items (14%). Participants also mentioned ﬁles

sitive and/or useful. For ﬁles deemed useful and not sensitive,
participants wanted to keep 93% of such ﬁles as-is. For ﬁles
that were not useful, in the vast majority of cases the partic-
ipant wanted to delete them, regardless of their sensitivity.
This result is somewhat at odds with informal wisdom re-
garding digital packrats wanting to keep all data by default,
but is consistent with the proposed management decision. In
94% of cases, participants wanted to delete ﬁles they con-
sidered not sensitive and not useful, while in 90% of cases
they wanted to delete ﬁles they considered not useful, yet
sensitive. These quantitative results directly align with the
hypothesized management model we presented in Figure 1.
When asked why they wanted to delete these ﬁles, the most
common response was that they no longer needed them or
that the ﬁles had served their purpose. The high likelihood
of removing ﬁles shows both a willingness to reduce digital
risk/clutter, as well as a lack of previous management that
could have already deleted useless ﬁles from the account.
For ﬁles deemed sensitive and useful, participants wanted
to protect 58% of them. In our model, we posited that
users would be likely to protect all sensitive and useful ﬁles.
Nonetheless, participants wanted to keep 39% of them as-is
despite their sensitivity. A potential reason behind this de-
cision is the subjective relationship between sensitivity and
how risky the ﬁle is. Our assumption in Figure 1 was that
all sensitive ﬁles are risky in some way and hence required
management. However, our results revealed greater nuance.
We asked participants why they wanted to protect these ﬁles.
Popular reasons included that the ﬁle contained PII or ﬁnan-
cial information, the ﬁle had sentimental value, and that the
ﬁle contained intellectual property. Most of the reported rea-
sons were consistent with the understanding of sensitivity
we developed during the qualitative interviews. We observed
a strong correlation between sentimental value and sensitiv-
ity. For instance, one participant wrote, “This is a photo of
a loved one I would like to keep private.” Prominent reasons
for the participant wanting to keep sensitive ﬁles as-is were
that they were satisﬁed with the overall level of protection of
their cloud account or that they did not consider the content
to be sensitive enough to warrant additional protection. Rep-
resenting the latter category, one participant described a ﬁle
by writing, “While it does contain proprietary information, it
is not sensitive enough to prompt additional security.”

related to personal hobbies, such as music and games. For
instance, one participant wrote, “I am a hobbyist musician,
so I like to keep previous versions of songs I make on Drive.
There have been occasions where I make a mistake later on
and it’s nice to have a previous version I can go back to.”
