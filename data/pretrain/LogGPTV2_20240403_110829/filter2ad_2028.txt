ABSTRACT
Many emerging applications and the ubiquitous wireless sig-
nals have accelerated the development of Device Free local-
ization (DFL) techniques, which can localize objects without
the need to carry any wireless devices. Most traditional DFL
methods have a main drawback that as the pre-obtained
Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements (i.e., finger-
print) in one area cannot be directly applied to the new area
for localization, and the calibration process of each area will
result in the human effort exhausting problem.
In this paper, we propose FALE, a fine-grained transfer-
ring DFL method that can adaptively work in different areas
with little human effort and low energy consumption. FALE
employs a rigorously designed transferring function to trans-
fer the fingerprint into a projected space, and reuse it across
different areas, thus greatly reduce the human effort. On the
other hand, FALE can reduce the data volume and energy
consumption by taking advantage of the compressive sens-
ing (CS) theory. Extensive real-word experimental results
also illustrate the effectiveness of FALE.

INTRODUCTION
Recent years have witnessed a surge in the DFL [3] ap-
proaches for plenty of emerging applications. The fingerprint
based DFL, which provides a fine-grained localization accu-
racy by using the RSS measurement (change) distorted by
the object as priori knowledge, have gone mainstream.

Figure 1: Gaussian estimation of the RSS measurements across 4
diffeptient link lengths under the same location. (a) shows that the
distributions of RSS measurements are significantly differ from each
other, and after transferring by FALE, the distributions are made as
close as possible in (b).
However, underlying current DFL approaches is a premise
that the monitoring area is fixed, which, unfortunately, is
unlikely in most practical settings. Actually, the pre-obtained
fingerprint in one area is distinct from another area which
has a different size. Therefore, it needs one to spend a lot
of time to calibrate each location in all the areas, which is
an human effort exhausting process.
To cope with this problem, this paper introduces FALE,
an transferring DFL method that can adaptively works in
different areas, with a fine-grained localization accuracy and
without the process of exhausted retraining in each area,
thus greatly reduce the human effort.
Specifically, different areas require to deploy different length
of links 1, and the differences of RSS measurements are re-
flected in their distributions, as shown in Fig.1(a). Based
on this, by utilizing the Fisher Linear Discriminant Analy-
sis (FLDA) as subspace learning algorithm and the Bregman
Divergence as a regularization term to measure the distri-
bution distance, FALE projects the RSS measurements into
a low-dimensional subspace where the distribution distance
across diffrent link lengths are made as close as possible
(Fig.1(b)), then the fingerprint of one area can be reused by
different areas, thus greatly reduce the human effort. More-
over, we use the CS approach in [1] to perform localization
accurately with a small number of RSS measurements.
2. TRANSFERRING SCHEME
In a high level, FALE goes through the following steps,
and the detailed transferring is shown in Fig.2: First, we
constructs the sensing matrix xl of area l × a, and collects
a few of RSS measurements xu for n randomly chosen lo-
cations in area u × b. Second, based on xl and xu, FALE
solves the transferring matrix. Third, we transfer the sens-
ing matrix of area l×a and the real-time RSS measurements
1Length of a link is the distance between the transceivers.

object locates in grid j will interfere some of M links, and for the same link 1, the distributions of Q continuous RSS measurements with link

Then in order to improve the localization accuracy in area
u× b, by using the RSS measurements of neighbor locations,
FALE generates RSS measurements for the locations which
are not represented as grids. Finally, we prove that after
transferring, the transferred sensing matrix satisfies the RIP.

We perform extensive experiments in an open-space de-
picted in Fig. 3, and we set the grid edge length as ω = 0.5m
when the link length is 4m. We add our transferring scheme
into two state-of-the-art algorithms RASS [4] and RTI [2],
refer as RASS w/ Trans. and RTI w/ Trans. for a fair com-
parison. And we also compare with the traditional CS based
localization method as CS w/o Trans. And we demonstrate
the effectiveness of FALE as follows.
Localization Performance. Fig. 4 illustrates the per-
formance of FALE is approximate to the CS w/o Trans., and
FALE performs best with 50% and 80% error of 0.87m and
1.23m, respectively. And the performance of RTI and RASS
improve 58% and 66% for 80% error respectively. Human
Effort Cost. We use the time-cost of the pre-deployment
to examine the human effort, Fig. 5 shows that the human
effort decreases are 41% under transferring from 3m to 6m,
88% from 4m to 12m, 93% from 3m to 12m. Energy Con-
sumption. We compare the energy consumption by in-
creasing the number of links to reach an given localization
accuracy. Fig. 6 shows that the energy consumption for
FALE, RTI w/ Trans. and RASS w/ Trans. are 18.3 mJ,
47.59 mJ, and 54.91 mJ, respectively.
