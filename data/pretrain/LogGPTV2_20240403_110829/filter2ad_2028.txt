## Abstract
The proliferation of emerging applications and the ubiquity of wireless signals have accelerated the development of Device-Free Localization (DFL) techniques, which can localize objects without requiring them to carry any wireless devices. Traditional DFL methods often suffer from the limitation that pre-obtained Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements (i.e., fingerprints) in one area cannot be directly applied to a new area, necessitating a labor-intensive calibration process for each new area.

In this paper, we introduce FALE, a fine-grained DFL method that can adaptively work in different areas with minimal human effort and low energy consumption. FALE employs a rigorously designed transfer function to project RSS fingerprints into a common subspace, enabling their reuse across different areas. Additionally, FALE leverages compressive sensing (CS) theory to reduce data volume and energy consumption. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FALE.

## 1. Introduction
Recent years have seen a surge in DFL approaches for various emerging applications. Fingerprint-based DFL, which uses RSS measurements distorted by the presence of an object as prior knowledge, has become a popular method for achieving fine-grained localization accuracy.

However, current DFL approaches often assume a fixed monitoring area, which is impractical in most real-world settings. The pre-obtained fingerprint in one area is distinct from that in another area of different size, requiring extensive recalibration for each new area, leading to significant human effort.

To address this challenge, we propose FALE, a transferring DFL method that can adaptively work in different areas with fine-grained localization accuracy and minimal retraining. FALE projects RSS measurements into a low-dimensional subspace where the distribution distance across different link lengths is minimized, allowing the fingerprint from one area to be reused in other areas. Furthermore, FALE utilizes CS to achieve accurate localization with a small number of RSS measurements.

## 2. Transferring Scheme
FALE operates through the following steps:

1. **Sensing Matrix Construction:** We construct the sensing matrix \( x_l \) for area \( l \times a \) and collect a few RSS measurements \( x_u \) for \( n \) randomly chosen locations in area \( u \times b \).
2. **Transfer Matrix Calculation:** Based on \( x_l \) and \( x_u \), FALE solves for the transfer matrix.
3. **Subspace Projection:** We project the sensing matrix of area \( l \times a \) and the real-time RSS measurements of area \( u \times b \) into a subspace \( R_q \) as \( z_{l} \) and \( z_{u} \), respectively, minimizing the distribution distance.

The general framework can be formulated as:
\[ z = W^T x \]
\[ W = \arg\min_{W \in \mathbb{R}^{Q \times q}} \{ F(W) + \lambda D_W(p_l || p_u) \} \]
with the constraint \( W^T W = I \). Here, \( F(W) \) is the Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) that projects the RSS streams, and \( D_W(p_l || p_u) \) is the Bregman Divergence measuring the distribution distance between \( p_l(z) \) and \( p_u(z) \).

The optimal \( W \) is obtained using the Gradient Descent algorithm:
\[ W_{k+1} = W_k - \eta(k) \left( \frac{\partial F(W)}{\partial W} + \lambda \cdot \frac{\partial D_W(p_l || p_u)}{\partial W} \right) \]
where \( \eta_k = \eta_0 / k \) is the learning rate.

## 3. Deployment and Results
We conducted extensive experiments in an open space, setting the grid edge length to \( \omega = 0.5 \) meters when the link length is 4 meters. We integrated our transferring scheme into two state-of-the-art algorithms, RASS [4] and RTI [2], and compared it with a traditional CS-based localization method (CS w/o Trans.).

### Localization Performance
Figure 4 shows that FALE's performance is comparable to CS w/o Trans., with 50% and 80% errors of 0.87 meters and 1.23 meters, respectively. The performance of RTI and RASS improved by 58% and 66% for 80% error, respectively.

### Human Effort Cost
Figure 5 illustrates the reduction in human effort, with decreases of 41%, 88%, and 93% for transfers from 3m to 6m, 4m to 12m, and 3m to 12m, respectively.

### Energy Consumption
Figure 6 compares the energy consumption, showing that FALE, RTI w/ Trans., and RASS w/ Trans. consume 18.3 mJ, 47.59 mJ, and 54.91 mJ, respectively.
