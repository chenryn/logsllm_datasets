### Data Collection and Analysis of ISP Traffic

#### Peering and Data Collection
The ISPs in our dataset engage in peering, meaning they do not provide transit services to each other. We collected month-long traffic logs from these ISPs, with a time resolution of two hours. This resolution was chosen as the highest common factor for the month-long data, given that both MRTG and RRDtool aggregate older records into coarser intervals to manage database size.

- **MRTG**: Maintains 2-hour resolution records for 31 days to generate monthly graphs.
- **RRDtool**: Typically configured to maintain 1-hour or 2-hour resolution records for monthly graphs.

We developed a Perl script to read MRTG and RRDtool log files, aggregate traffic measurements at a specified resolution, and output "timestamp, in-rate, out-rate" for each time step. Another script uses RRDtool to produce graphs. These tools were provided to the ISPs, allowing them to create aggregated logs without disclosing internal network details or unnecessary traffic information.

#### Workload and Data Aggregation
The primary workload for ISPs is classifying a large number of per-interface traffic logs and creating log lists for each group. For large ISPs, this can involve over 100,000 logs. To reduce this burden, ISPs are allowed to use the internal interface of a border router if it approximates the sum of external interfaces. In such cases, we instruct the tool to swap "in" and "out" records to align with the ISPs' perspective.

#### Data Collection Periods
We analyzed month-long traffic logs from seven major Japanese ISPs over 21 months: September, October, November 2004; May and November 2005; and May 2006. For analysis, we focused on the 2005 datasets, even though the latest set is from May 2006. We checked consistency in each ISP's share, differences from previous measurements, and IX traffic coverage. The aggregated results were shared with the ISPs for verification, ensuring the accuracy of the results. After initial trials, we decided to collect data only twice a year to reduce the ISPs' workload.

#### Data Validation
Monthly traffic logs with two-hour resolution allow us to identify major changes in each ISP’s traffic. When significant changes are detected, we contact the ISP to confirm the cause (e.g., network reconfiguration, outage, missing SNMP data, or misclassification). If necessary, we request corrected data. Short periods of missing SNMP data were found but had minimal impact (less than 1%) on the monthly average.

### Per-Customer Traffic Data Collection

To further analyze residential traffic, we obtained Sampled NetFlow data from one participating ISP. This ISP has residential broadband customers over DSL and fiber but not CATV. Data was collected from all edge routers accommodating residential broadband customers, with a sampling rate of 1/2048 to avoid overloading the routers. This rate is sufficient for analyzing heavy-hitters but may introduce some sampling error, especially for lightweight users.

- **Data Collection Periods**: Week-long data sets were collected five times: April, May, October 2004; February and July 2005. We used the February and July 2005 datasets for our analysis.
- **February 2005 Data**: Used to analyze per-customer behavior by matching customer IDs with assigned IP addresses. The ISP provided inbound/outbound traffic volume in one-hour resolution and customer attributes (line type and prefecture).
- **July 2005 Data**: Used to analyze geographic communication patterns. One end of the flow is always the residential customer, while the other end is generally a customer of another ISP. We used two geo-IP databases (Cyber Area Research Inc’s SUTF-POINT and Digital Envoy’s Netacuity) to classify both ends of the flows. SUTF-POINT maps domestic residential customers to prefectures, while Netacuity classifies non-residential addresses into domestic and international.

### Analysis of Aggregated Traffic

#### Growth of Traffic
- **Customer Traffic (RBB and Non-RBB)**: The growth rates for RBB customer traffic between November 2004 and November 2005 were 26% for inbound, 46% for outbound, and 37% for combined volume. The estimated ratio of RBB to total customer traffic was 59% for inbound and 64% for outbound in November 2005.
- **External Traffic**: The total volume of external domestic traffic (mainly private peering) exceeded the volume for the six major IXes. The ratio of international traffic to total external traffic was 30% for inbound and 26% for outbound in November 2005.

#### Relationship Between Customer and External Traffic
- **Total Customer Traffic (A) and Total External Traffic (B)**: Assuming all inbound traffic from other ISPs is destined to customers, the inbound traffic volume for the total external traffic (B) should be close to the outbound traffic volume for the total customer traffic (A). However, non-RBB customer data is provided by only four ISPs. Interpolating the missing ISPs, the total inbound and outbound customer traffic for November 2005 is estimated to be 248.4 Gbps and 304.4 Gbps, respectively.

#### Comparison with IX Traffic
- **IX Traffic Data**: Our data consistently represents about 42% of the total incoming traffic of the six major IXes. Using this ratio, the total amount of residential broadband traffic in Japan in November 2005 can be estimated to be 353 Gbps for inbound and 468 Gbps for outbound.

### Weekly Customer Traffic Patterns
- **Weekly Traffic Analysis**: We analyzed weekly customer traffic by averaging the same weekdays in a month, excluding holidays. Figure 6 shows the aggregated weekly traffic of RBB and non-RBB customers in November 2005, with darker vertical lines indicating the start of the day (0:00 am local time).

This comprehensive approach ensures accurate and detailed analysis of ISP and per-customer traffic, providing valuable insights into the behavior and growth of internet traffic.
