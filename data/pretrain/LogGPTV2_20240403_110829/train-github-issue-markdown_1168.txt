# Environment
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.239]
# Steps to reproduce
Sorry, I don't figure out clearly but this step always make cmd.exe hang. At
present, the method that can be reliably reproduced is to start vim.exe at the
bottom line of cmd.exe.
# Expected behavior
Do not hang.
# Actual behavior
Hang.
FYI, I tried to run this code, but not reproduce.
    #include 
    int
    main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    	HANDLE h = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
    	COORD coord;
    	coord.X = 80;
    	coord.Y = 300;
    	SetConsoleScreenBufferSize(h, coord);
    	return 0;
    }
