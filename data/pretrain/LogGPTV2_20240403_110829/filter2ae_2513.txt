### Introduction
Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration on Unix. It allows users to manage various system settings, such as user accounts, Apache, DNS, and file sharing, using a modern web browser.

On August 10, 2019, a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2019-15107) in Webmin was disclosed by penest. This vulnerability arises from the `password_change.cgi` file, specifically within the password reset functionality. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code without proper input validation. The Knownsec 404 Team discovered that this vulnerability was due to a backdoor implanted in some versions of the installation package and source code.

### Recurrence
The affected version of Webmin is 1.890 and 1.920. To reproduce the vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Password Resetting:**
   - Navigate to `Webmin Configuration -> Authentication`.
   - Check the box to allow users to set a new password using the old password.
   
2. **Restart Webmin:**
   - After enabling the setting, restart Webmin.
   - Verify that the `passwd_mode` value in the configuration file has changed from 0 to 2.

3. **Packet Capture and Exploitation:**
   - Perform packet capture during the password modification process.
   - Add `|ifconfig` to the old password parameter.
   - Observe that the command is successfully executed.

4. **Testing with Different Users:**
   - Attempt to exploit the vulnerability with different users, including the root user and a custom Webmin user.
   - Note that the root user (a Linux system account) does not work, while a custom Webmin user (e.g., `ethan`) can trigger the vulnerability.

### Analysis
The vulnerability is triggered when `passwd_mode=2`, which enables password resetting. The relevant code in `password_change.cgi` is as follows:

```perl
$miniserv{'passwd_mode'} == 2 || die "Password changing is not enabled!";
```

The script then checks if the user is a Webmin user or a system user. For Webmin users, it uses the `acl-lib.pl` library to handle authentication. If the user's password is set to `x`, it indicates that the user is using Unix authentication, and the script sets `$wuser` to `undef`.

```perl
if (&foreign_check("acl")) {
    &foreign_require("acl", "acl-lib.pl");
    ($wuser) = grep { $_->{'name'} eq $in{'user'} } &acl::list_users();
    if ($wuser->{'pass'} eq 'x') {
        # A Webmin user, but using Unix authentication
        $wuser = undef;
    }
}
```

If `$wuser` is `undef`, the script skips the password update logic, which includes the command execution code. This explains why the root user (a system user) does not trigger the vulnerability, while a custom Webmin user (with no authentication method set) can.

### Interesting Discoveries
The `qx/..../` syntax in the `pass_error` function is suspicious, as it is not present in the official patch. The presence of this code in the SourceForge version but not in the GitHub version suggests a potential backdoor. This is further supported by historical incidents, such as the 2012 SourceForge Korea CDN node compromise, where a backdoor was added to phpMyAdmin.

### Validating
To validate the presence of the backdoor, compare the `password_change.cgi` files from GitHub and SourceForge. The SourceForge version contains the vulnerable code, while the GitHub version does not. The 1.890 version of the SourceForge code is particularly concerning, as it does not require `passwd_mode=2` to trigger the vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Patching
To mitigate the vulnerability, take the following actions:
- **Upgrade to Version 1.930:** This version removes the backdoor.
- **Temporary Patching:** Manually remove the vulnerable code. Replace the following line in `password_change.cgi`:

```perl
$miniserv{'passwd_mode'} == 2 || die "Password changing is not enabled!";
```

### Conclusion
This incident highlights the importance of verifying the integrity of software packages. Thanks to @Longofo for their assistance in testing and analyzing the code.
