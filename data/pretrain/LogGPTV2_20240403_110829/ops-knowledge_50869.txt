User: Please analyze a failed network request. What are the possible causes of the failure? How to troubleshoot and fix?
Assistant: network request failure may have the following reasons for the failure: 1. Server failure: The server may have been down, the network has failed, or it is undergoing maintenance, which makes it unable to respond to the request. 2. Network connection problems: Unstable network links, inability to connect to the Internet, or network congestion may cause the request to fail. 3. Authentication issues: If the request requires specific permissions or authentication, but the authentication information is incorrect or expired, the request will fail. 4. Application error: There are loopholes or bugs in the application or interface, which cause the request to fail. If a network request fails, consider the following troubleshooting and repair steps: 1. Check whether the request contains wrong information or whether the request parameters are correct. You can print out the request log and check the exception step by step, such as whether the request path, request parameters, request header, etc. are wrong. 2. Use testing tools such as the Ping command to check the network to confirm whether there is a problem with the network connection. 3. Check whether the server is online or in maintenance state. You can tell if it is running by visiting the server address. 4. Check whether the authentication information is correct and valid, and verify whether the user rights are sufficient. 5. If it is an application error, you can use debugging to find the bug in the code and fix it. 6. If the problem persists, try changing the device or network environment.
