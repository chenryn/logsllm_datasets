**ATT&CK ID:** T1074.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Local Data Staging

Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory on the local system prior to exfiltration. This staging process can involve storing the data in separate files or consolidating it into a single file, often using techniques such as archiving. Interactive command shells, such as `cmd` and `bash`, may be utilized to copy the data to the staging location.

### Key Points:
- **Data Staging Location:** A central directory on the local system.
- **Data Storage Options:**
  - Separate files.
  - Consolidated into one file (e.g., through archiving).
- **Tools and Commands:**
  - Interactive command shells like `cmd` and `bash`.
  - Common commands for copying and moving files.

This technique allows adversaries to organize and prepare the data for efficient exfiltration.
