### Reliable and Objective Process Knowledge Acquisition

The individuals interviewed often have limited knowledge and may not always convey what they know. Sometimes, their statements contradict one another or even themselves. Additionally, while documented sources of process knowledge exist, they are not always accessible, and their presence does not guarantee quality.

### The Process Knowledge Framework

The process knowledge framework is a valuable tool in the acquisition phase of process knowledge. By providing an overview of available knowledge sources, it facilitates the decision-making process regarding which knowledge can be acquired with reasonable effort. Key criteria include accessibility, reliability, and, in the case of employees, their willingness to share information.

### Knowledge Acquisition Methods

Once the knowledge types are successfully collected, contrasting them using the dimensions of the process knowledge framework can significantly support the generation of process improvement knowledge. This approach helps identify potential areas for process improvement and a more feasible "to-be" model.

For example, comparing process capacity knowledge from activity performers with that from process designers can lead to discussions about misunderstandings, weak points, and potential improvements. Contrasting different dimensions, such as process roles and specific views, can also contribute to a comprehensive understanding of process improvement potential.

### Employee and External Involvement

To integrate employees and possibly external participants, structured interviews and workshops are commonly used. It is important to note that employees may behave differently when managers are not present, and managers tend to focus on "to-be" processes even when asked about the current state. Different groups often use different terminology to describe the same situation, leading to potential misunderstandings.

### Mental Models and Personal Attitudes

Investigating mental models and personal attitudes (business process improvement knowledge) can be done through two methods:
1. A psychologically-based, thorough knowledge acquisition, which is time-consuming.
2. A more cost-effective approach where the person acquiring the knowledge is aware of this dimension and records it during discussions.

### Documented Knowledge

Acquiring knowledge from documented sources is generally straightforward. However, additional methods, such as analyzing electronic trails (e.g., web server logs, email exchanges) and social networks, can extract relevant knowledge from less specific data.

### Communication of Process Knowledge

Simply deciding on a future "to-be" process description or model is not enough; effective communication of the necessary knowledge to employees is crucial. While change management is not the focus here, there is a clear connection: who needs which knowledge and when depends not only on the desired result but also on the organization's change process.

Typically, an improvement plan outlines the measures, order, goals, and priorities for change. Based on this, it can be determined what knowledge should be communicated to each employee. The process knowledge types necessary for their work must be clearly communicated, and a connection between the new "to-be" description and real-world examples is essential for understanding.

### Customizing Communication

Customizing both the content and form of communication for different target groups maximizes understanding. For instance, a well-crafted process manual that collects dust is ineffective. Instead, various forms of communication, such as training courses, workshops, personal discussions, and graphic visualizations, should be considered.

Social-communicative aspects, such as discussions between employees in different roles, can be particularly valuable. Open discussions can serve as forums for new suggestions and drive further improvements, not just in content but also in awareness and acceptance.

### Visualization and Technology

Visualizations and interactive electronic access can be highly effective. Current process modeling and visualization tools are primarily designed for specialists, but there is potential for new systems that support semantic technologies and are more user-friendly.

### Conclusion

The communication stage is about transferring process knowledge to employees in a way that is both understood and accepted. By customizing both the information and its form for different target groups, understanding is maximized, assuming the employees' willingness and the reasonable effort required for customization.
