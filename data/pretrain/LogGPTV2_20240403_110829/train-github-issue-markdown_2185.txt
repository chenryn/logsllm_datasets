I am in the process of upgrading from the legacy version 2.0.3 to `Sharding-JDBC 4.0.0-RC1`, and I have encountered several compatibility issues, including:

- The `FORCE INDEX` clause is causing SQL errors.
- The `LIMIT` clause does not work correctly when used with aggregate functions like `SUM`.

Given these issues, I would like to know how many SQL test cases are included in the `Sharding-JDBC 4.0.0-RC1` project to ensure that the upgrade process is as smooth as possible.

Thank you for your assistance.
