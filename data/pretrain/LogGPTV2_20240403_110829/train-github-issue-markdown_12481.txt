There is one RFC about logging: using STDERR for errors instead of STDOUT.
This is unrelated.
## Motivation ("The Why")
Currently some CI providers, specifically GitLab, restrict job artifacts to
being relative to the repository. Presumably, this stops you from uploading
runner files that may have dirty-state left from previous runs in non-
containerized workflows. Specifically the GitLab documents say,
> The `paths` keyword determines which files to add to the job artifacts.
> **All paths to files and directories are relative** to the repository where
> the job was created.
This effectively means NPM logs on error can not be captured as job artifacts.
### Example
### How
#### Current Behaviour
What I would like to do is something like this (ignore the actual error)
    $ npx ng e2e
    npm ERR! could not determine executable to run
    npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
    npm ERR!     /root/.npm/_logs/2021-11-22T17_24_50_085Z-debug.lo
Then I want to upload `/root/.npm/_logs/2021-11-22T17_24_50_085Z-debug.log` as
a job artifact.
**This is not currently possible**
#### Desired Behaviour
In light of GitLab not permitting global files to be uploaded as job artifacts
I would like an option to set the log file,
    npx [--log ] ng e2e
Such that `LOCATION` could be relative to the cwd.
Then I could do,
    $ npx --log "./.npm/_logs/" ng e2e
And set `./.npm/_logs/*` as my artifacts to upload to GitLab.
