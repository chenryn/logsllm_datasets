## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive study on an emerging paradigm of payment services that allows individual merchants to utilize personal transfer services on third-party platforms for commercial transactions. This is facilitated by an additional order management system, collectively referred to as the Personal Payment System (PPS). To gain a deeper understanding of these systems, we conducted a systematic analysis of 35 PPSs, covering over 11,740 merchant clients and supporting more than 20 million customers. By examining the documentation, available source codes, and demonstrations, we derived a common abstracted model for PPSs and identified seven categories of vulnerabilities in the design and implementation of existing personal payment protocols. Alarmingly, all PPSs under study exhibited at least one vulnerability. To further investigate these weaknesses, we developed corresponding attack methods to exploit the discovered vulnerabilities. We validated our proposed attacks through four successful real-world scenarios, demonstrating the severe consequences. We responsibly disclosed the newly discovered vulnerabilities, with some being patched after our reporting.

## 1. Introduction
The widespread adoption of online payment services, driven by pervasive network connections in modern computing devices, has made monetary transactions more convenient and secure. According to eMarketer reports, 1.06 billion people use proximity mobile payments, with Asia accounting for approximately half of this total, largely due to rapid adoption in China. Recognizing the growing market, numerous mobile payment platforms have been developed to facilitate payments among users without traditional methods such as credit cards and checks, often reducing the risk of information disclosure to vendors. Prominent third-party platforms include Alipay, Wexpay, Apple Pay, PayPal, and Venmo.

However, existing payment platforms have several limitations:
1. Individual payment accounts are not designed to handle large volumes of transactions, lacking scalable methods to automatically associate orders with payments.
2. The barrier to entry for small businesses is high, requiring government-issued licenses and significant upfront costs.
3. There is a non-trivial initial financial commitment.

To address these drawbacks, a new form of payment management service, known as the Personal Payment System (PPS), has emerged. PPS acts as a broker between buyers and sellers, providing a minimalist payment management system with lower transaction fees and initial financial commitments. These systems do not function as individual financial institutions but rely on existing personal transfer services from third-party platforms for actual money transfers.

Given the complex interactions and security challenges in PPS, we conducted a systematic analysis of 35 PPSs, covering over 11,740 merchant clients and 20 million customers. We identified five key components in their design: PPS enrollment and key distribution, order generation, order payment, payment notification, and order inquiry. We discovered seven unique patterns of vulnerabilities, primarily within the order generation process. Based on these findings, we designed and implemented five proof-of-concept attacks to demonstrate the real-world threat. All experiments were conducted on test accounts, and the results were reported to vendors for mitigation.

## 2. Personal Payment System

### 2.1 Definition
A Personal Payment System (PPS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates personal money transfer functions provided by third-party platforms with an order management platform developed by a PPS provider. It enables small businesses to leverage personal financial accounts for commercial transactions without significant upfront costs. Due to its low barrier of entry, PPSs have attracted many merchants, especially startups and small businesses.

Third-party platforms provide free personal money transfer services, but lack payment and order management functionalities. PPS providers develop a payment management platform to complement these services. Merchants must register an account on the PPS system and link it to an existing personal account on a third-party platform like Alipay. The PPS platform then provides a unified commercial-capable interface for payment and order tracking.

### 2.2 Comparison with Commercial Payment Systems
While both third-party commercial payment systems (TP-CPS) and PPSs manage commercial-scale transactions, there are key differences in their ecosystems. TP-CPS, as shown in Figure 1(a), involves three entities: Merchant Client (MC), Merchant Server (MS), and Cashier Server (CS). The CS manages money transactions and tracks payment status, integrated with order management for a fee.

In contrast, PPS, as shown in Figure 1(b), uses an independent order management system. Merchants register a personal account with the CS and a commercial account with the PPS Order Management Platform (PMP). The PMP records transaction information, monitors cash flow, and verifies order status, avoiding transaction fees. The PMP notifies the MS when a payment is made, and the merchant account at PMP continuously monitors the CS for payment events.

### 2.3 Abstracted Model
The common abstracted model of PPSs includes the following steps:

#### 2.3.1 Enrollment and Key Distribution/Update
- **Enrollment and Initial Key Distribution:** Merchants register a personal account on the third-party cashier server and a commercial account on the PPS. After registration, a unique key (KEY) is generated and distributed via the PPS website, protected by web-based security techniques.
- **Key Update:** Merchants can request key updates via the PPS website or REST API calls. Most PPSs support key updates via API, with 88% not requiring authentication.

#### 2.3.2 Common Interface and Order Format
- **Order and Payment Information:** PPSs typically offer API-based payment services. Order and transaction details are encapsulated in a JSON object sent through the order API (O-API). Required fields include order identifier, payment URL, price, merchant ID, and a signature (Token) for integrity protection. Surprisingly, all PPSs use MD5 to generate the Token.

## 3. Transaction Flow
The transaction flow in PPS, as shown in Figure 2, involves the following steps:
1. **Order Generation:** The MC sends an order request (orderrq) to the PMP.
2. **Token Generation:** The PMP generates a Token using the KEY and order details.
3. **Order Processing:** The PMP processes the order and sends the payment details to the buyer.
4. **Payment Notification:** The buyer pays the required amount to the merchant’s personal account.
5. **Monitoring:** The PMP monitors the merchant’s personal account for the expected money flow.
6. **Order Checking:** The PMP verifies the order status and notifies the MS to continue the order process.

## 4. Contributions
- **Dissection of PPS Internals:** We presented a common abstracted model of PPSs.
- **Vulnerability Discovery:** We identified seven vulnerable patterns and developed five new attack methods.
- **Empirical Study:** We analyzed 35 widely used PPSs and conducted four real-world attacks to demonstrate the vulnerabilities.
- **Responsible Disclosure:** We reported all discovered flaws and worked with vendors to fix the vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation Suggestions:** We provided a root cause analysis and discussed how to secure the ecosystem.

## 5. Conclusion
Our study provides a detailed analysis of the emerging Personal Payment System (PPS) and highlights the vulnerabilities in their design and implementation. By conducting empirical studies and developing proof-of-concept attacks, we demonstrated the real-world threats and worked with vendors to mitigate these risks. Our findings and suggestions aim to enhance the security of PPSs and protect their users.
