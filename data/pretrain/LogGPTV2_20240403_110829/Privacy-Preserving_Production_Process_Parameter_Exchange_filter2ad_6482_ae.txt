### 8.2.1 PPE: Improved Provider Privacy with PSI

Privacy-Preserving Exchange (PPE) can enhance the privacy of data providers by using Private Set Intersection (PSI). However, this approach is only feasible when the candidate sets are small. In scenarios with large candidate sets, such as in injection molding, PPE becomes impractical.

### 8.2.2 OPE: Fully OT-Powered Approach

In the context of OPE (Oblivious Transfer-Powered Exchange), the storage server learns the identifiers of the retrieved records, which compromises client privacy. To mitigate this, record retrieval can be implemented using Oblivious Transfers (OTs), similar to key retrieval. The resulting approach, OPE, is conceptually similar to the work by Dahlmanns et al. [21]. 

First, a PSI is used to compute the matching (as described in Section 8.2.1), and then both keys and ciphertexts (records) are retrieved via OTs. However, relying on OTs for data retrieval introduces significant limitations. For instance, LibOTe can only transmit 128 bits per OT, as OTs are primarily designed for transmitting key material rather than the actual payload [2]. Given that our ciphertexts are significantly larger, multiple OTs are required to retrieve a single ciphertext, increasing the overhead by a factor of \( t \).

Moreover, the size of the OT set defines the number of supported indices, limiting the number of records that can be handled. These constraints highlight that OPE is only suitable for small-scale scenarios with strong privacy requirements. We expect it to be infeasible for most use cases and, therefore, do not further evaluate it.

### 9. Related Work

Next, we present related work on privacy-preserving information retrieval and discuss their applicability to our scenario. Table 1 summarizes our findings.

- **Private Information Retrieval (PIR) [17]**: PIR protocols focus on client privacy, hiding the query from the database server. However, they do not protect the server's privacy (G1). Therefore, PIR is not applicable to our scenario, where the client must not learn anything beyond the matching records.
  
- **Oblivious Transfer (OT) [60]**: Used as a building block in our design, OT provides high privacy but is not efficient for transmitting large amounts of data, as discussed in Section 8.2.2.

- **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) [89] and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) [31]**: These can also be used for privacy-preserving information retrieval [95]. However, SMC has high overhead (G4) and is less efficient than purpose-driven protocols. HE approaches that mimic PIR suffer from similar inefficiencies [50] and are limited in supporting arbitrary similarity metrics (G3).

- **Privacy-Preserving Remote Knowledge System (RKS) [21]**: RKS uses OTs for data retrieval after a PSI determines the matching elements. This reduces the overhead of OTs. However, the limitations of PSI restrict the size of the candidate set, as discussed in Section 8.2.

- **Symmetric Searchable Encryption (SSE) [77] and Public-Key Searchable Encryption (PKSE) [8]**: Both SSE and PKSE allow search operations to be delegated to an untrusted third party, such as a cloud service. The third party returns matched elements without learning the plaintexts. However, these approaches assume the client can freely access all stored data, which does not satisfy our server privacy requirement (G1).

- **Privacy-Preserving Sharing of Sensitive Information (PPSSI) [24]**: PPSSI aims to protect both client and server privacy (G1 and G2) by introducing a semi-trusted third party called the Isolated Box (IB). The IB cannot access plaintext information independently. However, PPSSI only supports disjunctive queries and a single data source, making it unsuitable for our scenario, which requires conjunctive queries and multiple data providers.

- **Private Database Queries Using SWHE (PDBQ) [9]**: PDBQ extends PPSSI by supporting conjunctive queries. However, it assumes a single data provider and requires the computation of an inverted index, which needs plaintext access. This makes it challenging to adapt to multiple independent data providers. Additionally, PDBQ does not scale well for our scenario, which involves more query parameters.

While many diverse applications exist in private information retrieval, they either reduce server privacy or require significant adaptation for our scenario. We address this gap by proposing BPE and PPE, two variants of privacy-preserving exchange platforms.

### 10. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced a new design for the industrial setting to enable the privacy-preserving exchange of production process parameters, which can significantly improve productivity and reduce costs. BPE is based on existing cryptographic building blocks, such as Bloom filters and OTs, and respects the privacy needs of both clients and data providers. For scenarios with fewer records and stronger privacy needs, we propose a PSI-based variant called PPE.

We demonstrated the applicability and relevance of our approaches through two real-world use cases: (i) process parameter retrieval for injection molding, allowing companies to integrate external knowledge into their transfer learning, and (ii) an exchange for machine tool parameters, enabling companies to improve their machine settings even for individual workpieces.

Our evaluation shows that BPE scales well to today’s real-world needs in terms of both privacy and processing, and is easily deployable without requiring specific hardware. In scenarios where the exchanged production data is valuable and impactful, the processing times for privacy preservation are generally acceptable. Thus, settings with sensitive metrics, such as injection molding, are prime candidates for BPE.

Future work should explore concepts for rating the value of exchanged process data, enabling new business models for data-providing companies. Research could also look into transforming the platform into a subscription model to ease the billing process. Measures to improve the auditability of transferred and queried records could address potential accountability needs of companies. By releasing BPE and PPE as open-source, we aim to contribute to newly envisioned industrial collaborations, offering a ready-to-use privacy-preserving architecture to address widely-established privacy concerns.
