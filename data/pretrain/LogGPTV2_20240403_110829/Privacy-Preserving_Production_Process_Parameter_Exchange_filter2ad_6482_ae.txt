PPE can provide improved provider privacy. However, small can-
didate sets are essential for the use of PSIs. Hence, in general, it is
infeasible for injection molding with potentially large candidate sets.
8.2.2 OPE: Fully OT-Powered Approach. Given that the storage
server learns the identifiers of retrieved records, client privacy
is impaired. To mitigate this effect, the record retrieval could be
realized over OTs as well (similar to the key retrieval). The resulting
approach, OPE, is conceptually similar to work by Dahlmanns et
al. [21]: First, the matching is computed via a PSI (cf. Section 8.2.1)
and then both keys and ciphertexts (records) are retrieved via OTs.
However, relying on OTs for the data retrieval introduces signif-
icant limitations. LibOTe can only transmit 128 Bit per OT because
OTs are mainly designed for the transmission of key material and
not the payload itself [2]. However, our ciphertexts are signifi-
cantly larger, ultimately depending on the use case. Accordingly, ùë°
subsequent OTs are needed to retrieve a single ciphertext, which
increases the overhead by factor ùë°. More importantly, the OT set
size defines the number of supported indices. Consequentially, only
a low number of records can be handled by the exchange platform.
These limitations highlight that OPE is only applicable to small
scenarios with strong privacy needs. We expect that it is not applicable
to most use cases and thus refrain from further evaluation.
9 RELATED WORK
Next, we present related work dealing with privacy-preserving
information retrieval and discuss to which extent they are applicable
to our scenario. In Table 1, we give an overview of our findings.
Private information retrieval (PIR) [17] protocols deal with privacy-
preserving data retrieval from a database. However, PIR protocols
only consider the client‚Äôs privacy, i.e., the query is hidden from the
database server, while the server‚Äôs privacy (G1) is not protected.
Accordingly, this class of protocols [17, 49] is not applicable to our
scenario, as the client is not allowed to learn anything beyond the
matching records. Oblivious transfer (OT) [60], which is used as a
building block of our design, represents symmetric PIR. While it
can provide a high level of privacy, OTs alone are not feasible for
transmitting large amounts of data, as explained in Section 8.2.2.
Other primitives for secure computations, such as secure multi-
party computation (SMC) [89] and homomorphic encryption (HE) [31],
can be used for privacy-preserving information retrieval as well [95].
However, SMC comes with high overhead (G4) and does not reach
the efficiency of purpose-driven protocols for private information

retrieval [24]. HE approaches that mimic such protocols suffer from
the same inefficiency [50]. In addition, supporting arbitrary similar-
ity metrics (G3) with an HE scheme is infeasible as it either offers
only a restricted set of operations or becomes overly complex [28].
The privacy-preserving remote knowledge system (RKS) [21] tack-
les the feasibility of data retrievals via OT. A PSI determines match-
ing elements, such that only matched elements induce an expensive
OT. We base PPE on this approach. However, limitations of the PSI
restrict the size of the candidate set, as discussed in Section 8.2.
Both symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) [77] and public-key
searchable encryption (PKSE) [8] allow the delegation of a search
operation to an untrusted third party, e.g., a cloud service. These
approaches encrypt data and search queries. The third party returns
matched elements to the client without learning the plaintexts. Ap-
plied to our scenario, data providers could upload their (encrypted)
data. Then, clients could send a search query. However, both ap-
proaches assume that the party delegating the search, i.e., the client,
is allowed to freely access all stored data without restrictions. Ac-
cordingly, they cannot satisfy the required server privacy (G1).
Privacy-preserving sharing of sensitive information (PPSSI) [24]
considers related design goals, i.e., demanding both client and server
privacy (G1 and G2). This approach introduces a semi-trusted third
party, called isolated box (IB), that must be non-colluding with client
and server. It cannot access plaintext information on its own. The
data represents database records with multiple attributes that allow
the client to pose disjunctive queries over multiple attributes. How-
ever, conjunctive queries are not supported. Disjunctive queries are
not useful in our scenario as all input parameters have to match
the client‚Äôs candidate. Additionally, PPSSI only considers a single
data source (the server), while we have to support multiple data
providers. The encryption process, which is offloaded to the IB,
requires knowledge on how many records with a certain attribute-
value pair exist. Accordingly, the encryption cannot independently
be outsourced from the server to the data providers (G3). Therefore,
adapting this approach to our scenario is far from trivial.
The approach of private database queries using SWHE (PDBQ) [9]
extents the PPSSI solution by conjunctive queries. However, it also
assumes that the data is provided by one server, which is actively
involved in the data exchange. Moreover, PDBQ requires the compu-
tation of an inverted index by the server entity. Due to the fact that
this computation needs plaintext access to the stored data, an addi-
tional semi-trusted storage server cannot perform it, i.e., computing
the inverted index requires information on how many records with
a certain attribute-value pair exist. Hence, the challenge of adapt-
ing it to multiple independent data providers, as required by our
scenario, remains. Additionally, we expect that PDBQ does not
scale to our scenario (G4) as it was only evaluated with up to 5
attribute-value pairs and our scenario calls for significantly more
query parameters, each adding a random linear combination.
While many diverse applications in the area of private information
retrieval exist, they are inapplicable to our scenario as existing work
either results in reduced server privacy or requires significant adoption
effort for our scenario. We bridge this gap by proposing BPE and PPE,
two variants of privacy-preserving exchange platforms.
10 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduced a new design for the industrial setting
to enable the privacy-preserving exchange of production process
parameters, which is expected to significantly improve productivity
and reduce costs alike. BPE is based on existing (cryptographic)
building blocks, i.e., Bloom filters and OTs, and respects the privacy
needs of both clients and data providers. For scenarios with fewer
records and stronger privacy needs, we also propose a PSI-based
variant called PPE. We showcase the applicability and relevance
of our approaches based on two real-world use cases: (i) a process
parameter retrieval for injection molding, which allows companies
to integrate external knowledge into their transfer learning, and (ii)
an exchange for machine tool parameters which enables companies
to improve their machine settings even for individual workpieces.
We conducted an in-depth analysis of all aspects of our design.
Our evaluation shows that BPE scales well to today‚Äôs real-world
needs (both in terms of privacy and processing) and is easily de-
ployable as no specific hardware is required. Especially in scenarios
where the exchanged production data is valuable and impactful for
retrieving companies, the processing times for privacy preservation
of our design are generally acceptable. Thus, settings with sensitive
metrics, such as injection molding, are prime candidates for BPE.
Future work should look into concepts that rate the value of
exchanged process data and, thereby, enable new business models
for data-providing companies. Similarly, research could look into
ways to transform the platform into a subscription model to ease
the billing process. Measures to improve the auditability of trans-
fered (and queried) records could be researched to address potential
accountability needs of companies. By releasing BPE and PPE as
open-source, we hope to contribute to realize newly envisioned in-
dustrial collaborations: We offer a ready-to-use privacy-preserving
architecture to address widely-established privacy concerns.
