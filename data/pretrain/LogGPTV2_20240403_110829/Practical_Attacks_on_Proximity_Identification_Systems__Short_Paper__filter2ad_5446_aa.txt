Abstract
The number of RFID devices used in everyday life has in-
creased, along with concerns about their security and user
privacy. This paper describes our initial ﬁndings on prac-
tical attacks that we implemented against ‘proximity’ (ISO
14443 A) type RFID tokens. Focusing mainly on the RF
communication interface we discuss the results and imple-
mentation of eavesdropping, unauthorized scanning and re-
lay attacks. Although most of these attack scenarios are
regularly mentioned in literature little technical details have
been published previously. We also present a short overview
of mechanisms currently available to prevent these attacks.
1. Introduction
RFID devices are used for logistics, access control, cash-
less payment systems and even travel documents [11, 21,
22]. No physical contact needs to be made with the reader,
which simpliﬁes operation and increases transaction speeds.
This lack of human interaction has however led to fears that
this technology could be abused and as a result most RFID
discussions have centered around privacy concerns. Con-
sumer groups claim that information about the user could be
acquired without consent, and therefore rallied against the
“big brother” potential of RFID technology. And as RFID
devices are used for transactions of increasing value they
also become the target of a lone attacker, who if able to
read the device while in somebody’s purse or wallet, might
be able to engage in the act of digital theft while standing
next to or walking past his victim. This has understand-
ably driven research into RFID security. For a full academic
overview it would be best to consult comprehensive sources
on RFID security and privacy research [2,16].
Even though several papers make claims about the pos-
sibilities of relay and eavesdropping attacks on RFID de-
vices they don’t always describe implementations or show
results. Kﬁr and Wool [20] published the most relevant pa-
per where they modeled a contactless smart card system and
simulated the distances achievable for reader→token and
token→reader communication in the context of a relay at-
tack. As discussed in section 2, RFID is a general term for
any near ﬁeld communication device. A contactless smart
card is not the same as a tag used in logistics so if somebody
can read a razor’s tag from 1 m it cannot be assumed that
the same is true for an e-passport. Different scenarios also
exist for eavesdropping, as discussed in section 3, and there-
fore the experimental setup should be known in order for the
information to be useful. These factors also add to the con-
fusion surrounding current reports about RFID eavesdrop-
ping. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) demo,
where a passport was read from 3 feet, used “similar” RFID
technology to the real e-passport [1], and no further info
was released after press reports that the US National Insti-
tute of Science and Technology (NIST) eavesdropped the
RFIDs to be used in US passports from as far away as 30
feet [29].
This paper describes our implementation of practical
eavesdropping and relay attacks against RFID devices. It
should be mentioned beforehand that we did not aim to
compete with a professional RF testing institution. We sim-
ply worked towards proof of concept and practical descrip-
tions of attacks, as might be implemented by an attacker
with some RF knowledge and ﬁnite resources. We present
and discuss some preliminary unauthorized scanning and
eavesdropping ranges achieved during our experimentation.
These result are intended as a starting point for further re-
search in this ﬁeld, which would be helpful in determining
an accurate threat model for RFID systems.
2. RFID Background
RFID is a collective term for near ﬁeld communication
devices and in reality refers to devices adhering to a number
of different standards. In the HF band interfaces have been
standardized for “proximity” (ISO 14443 [12]), “vicinity”
(ISO 15693 [13]) and “near ﬁeld” (NFCIP-1/ECMA340,
ISO 18092 [15]) devices, with maximum operating ranges
in the order of 10 cm to 1 m. A further standard, ISO

18000 [14] deﬁnes possible communication interfaces for
LF, HF, and UHF bands. The EPC Class-1 standard [6]
is well known for UHF item management tags, which also
operate at a much longer range. Our experiments were con-
ducted in the HF band using tokens conforming to the ISO
14443 A standard, which is used by popular commercial
products such as Philips Mifare (and is also one of the stan-
dards speciﬁed for e-passports [18]).
It also corresponds
closely to the “near ﬁeld” standard so attacks could be ex-
tended to work in this environment.
RFID tokens receive both data and power from the car-
rier transmitted by the reader. Within the HF band this is
based on the principle of mutual inductance and coupling
two coils via their magnetic ﬁeld.
In the ISO 14443 A
standard the data from the reader to the token is modu-
lated onto a 13.56 MHz carrier using 100% Amplitude Shift
Keying (ASK). Modiﬁed Miller coding is used because the
3 μs pulses, where the carrier is absent, are short enough
to allow the resonant circuit in the token to maintain the
power level while also receiving data. The token’s response
is Manchester coded and modulates a 847 kHz subcarrier,
again using ASK, with the result then load modulated onto
the main carrier. Load modulation varies the impedance of
the token’s resonant circuit by switching additional resistive
or capactive loads in time with the data stream, therefore
achieving amplitude modulation of the reader’s carrier. The
data rate for both reader→token and token→reader is 106
kbits/s [7]. An example of a communication exchange is
shown as reference in Figure 2(a).
3. Eavesdropping
Some people see near ﬁeld communication as secure be-
cause the speciﬁed communication range is small, ≤ 10 cm,
with most commercial readers only operating at a range of
1 or 2 cm. Eavesdropping of signals is therefore an obvious
attack in the RF environment. There are two main attacks to
consider. Passive eavesdropping is the interception of com-
munication between a legitimate reader and a token. Active
eavesdropping, or scanning, involves a malicious reader that
could try and access a token without its owner’s consent. In
practice the attacker would have to provide power and com-
municate with the token over a longer distance than nor-
mally speciﬁed, as the owner might become suspicious of
somebody in his personal space. The fact that an attacker is
not bound by the same transmission limits [5] adhered to by
industry designers makes this attack practical.
There are different distance parameters involved in
eavesdropping experiments. Figure 1 gives an overview of
these parameters. For active eavesdropping the ﬁrst step
is to activate the token and the second step is to retrieve
the token’s response. We deﬁne dp as the distance from
which an attacker’s reader can activate the token by provid-
ing power and communicating information. We also deﬁne
de, which is the distance at which the attacker can recover
the token’s response. If the attacker only uses one antenna
for active scanning dp would equal de. We propose the sce-
nario where two antennas are used, which allows for more
ﬂexibility. de is not limited by dp and different types of
antennas can be used for powering/transmitting and receiv-
ing. Consider a case where a simple loop antenna, which is
efﬁcient for generating the magnetic ﬁeld (H) required for
power transfer but ineffective for receiving, can be hidden
close to the target token. A much larger and complicated
antenna can then be placed further away for eavesdropping
on the communication. For passive eavesdropping we de-
ﬁne dE as the distance, from the token, where the attacker
can recover a two-way communication sequence between a
reader and token. In effect this can be seen as a special case
of active eavesdropping with dp in the order of 2 cm.
To further complicate matters we must make a distinc-
tion between the eavesdropping range of reader→token
(dR→T ) and token→reader (dT →R) communication. The
token→reader communication is very dependent on the mu-
tual magnetic coupling and near-ﬁeld characteristics of the
system. The effect of the load modulation on the carrier
is also much smaller in amplitude when compared with the
ASK modulation used for reader→tag communication. For

our results we deﬁne that a successful eavesdropping attack
recovers both reader→token and token→reader communi-
cation. dE and de is therefore equal to the value of dT →R
in each case.
3.1. Passive Eavesdropping
For the attacker’s antenna we used the Dynamic Sciences
R-1250 Wide Range receiver with the R-1150-10A Portable
Antenna Kit. The R-1250 is a superheterodyne receiver op-
erating from 100 Hz – 1 GHz with selectable bandwidths
from 50 Hz – 200 MHz. The antenna kit includes a set
of H-ﬁeld ferrite core antennas for ﬁeld-strength measure-
ments in the 100 Hz – 30 MHz range. Looking at the H-ﬁeld
is of particular interest when taking into account the mag-
netic nature of proximity devices. The wide range receiver
allows users to quickly scan a range of frequencies look-
ing for compromising transmissions. Once the frequency
and bandwidth of the data is determined the receiver holds
no real advantage over a simple amplitude demodulator so
not every attacker needs one. We then continuously queried
a Philips Mifare token using a commercial ISO 14443 A
reader capable of reading a token from approximately 2 cm.
The reader is build around the Philips MF RC530 contact-
less reader IC, which is capacitively coupled to a 60x45 mm
loop antenna, and is implemented as shown in the relevant
manufacturer’s data sheets [24]. Figure 2(a) shows exam-
ples of recovered data for two different values of dE.
In
Figure 2(a) the two-way communication is still clearly visi-
ble. The token’s response in Figure 2(b) is much more noisy
but the data sequence could still be recovered using a simple
comparator with hysteresis. The token→reader communi-
cation became indistinguishable from the surrounding noise
as dE exceeded 400 cm even though the reader→token
communication was still visible. Please note that the dif-
ference in trace magnitude between Figure 2(a) and Figure
2(b) does not accurately reﬂect signal degradation as the re-
ceiver’s ampliﬁer settings were readjusted at each distance
to best recover the signal. Even though we can conﬁrm that
eavesdropping is possible up to 4 m our result is well short
of the 9 m described in the NIST report and at this stage we
cannot reject or support their claim. It is very feasible that
the value of dE could be increased with application spe-
ciﬁc antennas, more complex signal processing or simply
running the experiments in an environment with less back-
ground RF noise.
3.2. Active Scanning
We created an attacking reader by amplifying the carrier
and data signal from the reader, described in section 3.1,
and transmitting it using larger loop antennas. For the at-
tacker’s antenna we used the same antennas and wide range
receiver as we used for passive eavesdropping. We then ex-
perimented with different antennas sizes (A5, A4 and A3)
and RF ampliﬁers (0.5 W, 1 W, 2 W and 4 W). Reference
designs, performance trade-offs and theoretical limits for
these antennas and ampliﬁers are publicly available [26,27].

3.2.1 Reader to Token
We set up each antenna/ampliﬁer combination and mea-
sured the maximum distance where we could activate a to-
ken. To test whether a token had been powered and received
the data correctly we used a pick-up coil in close proximity
to see if it generated the correct response. The results are
shown in Table 1 and are as expected. dp is proportional to
the antenna radius/transmitted power. dR→T is of no sig-
niﬁcance as the attacker is transmitting the reader→ token
data.
