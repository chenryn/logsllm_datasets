## Abstract

The proliferation of RFID devices in everyday applications has raised significant concerns about their security and user privacy. This paper presents our initial findings on practical attacks implemented against 'proximity' (ISO 14443 A) type RFID tokens. Focusing primarily on the RF communication interface, we discuss the results and implementation of eavesdropping, unauthorized scanning, and relay attacks. Despite frequent mentions of these attack scenarios in literature, detailed technical information has been scarce. We also provide a brief overview of existing mechanisms to prevent such attacks.

## 1. Introduction

RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) devices are widely used in logistics, access control, cashless payment systems, and travel documents [11, 21, 22]. Their contactless nature simplifies operation and enhances transaction speeds. However, this lack of physical interaction has sparked fears of potential abuse, leading to extensive discussions on privacy concerns. Consumer groups argue that RFID technology could enable unauthorized acquisition of personal information, raising "big brother" concerns. As RFID devices are increasingly used for high-value transactions, they become attractive targets for individual attackers who can potentially read and exploit the data without the owner's knowledge. This has driven research into RFID security. For a comprehensive academic overview, refer to sources on RFID security and privacy [2, 16].

While several papers have discussed the theoretical possibilities of relay and eavesdropping attacks, few have provided detailed implementations or empirical results. Kfir and Wool [20] modeled a contactless smart card system and simulated the distances achievable for reader-to-token and token-to-reader communication in a relay attack. It is important to note that RFID is a general term encompassing various near-field communication devices, and different types of tags (e.g., those used in logistics versus e-passports) may have different vulnerabilities. The experimental setup and specific conditions are crucial for understanding the feasibility of such attacks. For instance, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) demonstrated reading a passport from 3 feet using "similar" RFID technology, but further details were not disclosed after reports that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) eavesdropped on RFID chips in passports from up to 30 feet [29].

This paper describes our implementation of practical eavesdropping and relay attacks on RFID devices. Our goal was not to compete with professional RF testing institutions but to provide proof-of-concept and practical descriptions of attacks that could be carried out by an attacker with some RF knowledge and limited resources. We present and discuss preliminary unauthorized scanning and eavesdropping ranges achieved during our experiments, which serve as a starting point for further research in this field.

## 2. RFID Background

RFID is a collective term for near-field communication devices, adhering to various standards. In the High Frequency (HF) band, interfaces are standardized for "proximity" (ISO 14443), "vicinity" (ISO 15693), and "near field" (NFCIP-1/ECMA340, ISO 18092) devices, with operating ranges typically between 10 cm and 1 m. Another standard, ISO 18000, defines communication interfaces for Low Frequency (LF), HF, and Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) bands. The EPC Class-1 standard is well-known for UHF item management tags, which operate at longer ranges. Our experiments focused on the HF band using tokens conforming to the ISO 14443 A standard, commonly found in commercial products like Philips Mifare and specified for e-passports [18]. This standard closely aligns with the "near field" standard, making our findings applicable to both environments.

RFID tokens receive both data and power from the carrier transmitted by the reader. In the HF band, this is based on mutual inductance, coupling two coils via their magnetic fields. In the ISO 14443 A standard, data from the reader to the token is modulated onto a 13.56 MHz carrier using 100% Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK). Modified Miller coding is employed, with 3 μs pulses allowing the resonant circuit in the token to maintain power while receiving data. The token's response is Manchester coded and modulates an 847 kHz subcarrier, again using ASK, and then load modulated onto the main carrier. Load modulation varies the impedance of the token's resonant circuit, achieving amplitude modulation of the reader's carrier. The data rate for both reader-to-token and token-to-reader communication is 106 kbits/s [7]. An example of a communication exchange is shown in Figure 2(a).

## 3. Eavesdropping

Near-field communication is often considered secure due to its short specified range (≤ 10 cm), with most commercial readers operating at 1-2 cm. Eavesdropping remains a significant threat, involving two main types: passive eavesdropping (interception of communication between a legitimate reader and a token) and active eavesdropping (scanning by a malicious reader). In practice, an attacker must provide power and communicate over a longer distance than specified, as the owner might become suspicious of someone in close proximity. The fact that attackers are not bound by the same transmission limits as industry designers makes this attack feasible.

Eavesdropping experiments involve different distance parameters, as illustrated in Figure 1. For active eavesdropping, the first step is to activate the token, and the second step is to retrieve the token's response. We define \( d_p \) as the distance from which an attacker's reader can activate the token and \( d_e \) as the distance at which the attacker can recover the token's response. If the attacker uses one antenna, \( d_p \) equals \( d_e \). Using two antennas allows more flexibility, with \( d_e \) not limited by \( d_p \). For passive eavesdroping, \( d_E \) is the distance from the token where the attacker can recover a two-way communication sequence. This can be seen as a special case of active eavesdropping with \( d_p \) around 2 cm.

We also distinguish between the eavesdropping ranges for reader-to-token (\( d_{R \rightarrow T} \)) and token-to-reader (\( d_{T \rightarrow R} \)) communication. Token-to-reader communication depends on mutual magnetic coupling and near-field characteristics, with a smaller effect on the carrier compared to the ASK modulation used for reader-to-tag communication. For our results, a successful eavesdropping attack recovers both reader-to-token and token-to-reader communication, making \( d_E \) and \( d_e \) equal to \( d_{T \rightarrow R} \).

### 3.1. Passive Eavesdropping

For passive eavesdropping, we used the Dynamic Sciences R-1250 Wide Range receiver with the R-1150-10A Portable Antenna Kit. The R-1250 is a superheterodyne receiver operating from 100 Hz to 1 GHz with selectable bandwidths from 50 Hz to 200 MHz. The antenna kit includes H-field ferrite core antennas for field-strength measurements in the 100 Hz to 30 MHz range. The wide range receiver allows users to quickly scan frequencies for compromising transmissions. Once the frequency and bandwidth are determined, a simple amplitude demodulator can be used. We continuously queried a Philips Mifare token using a commercial ISO 14443 A reader capable of reading a token from approximately 2 cm. The reader is built around the Philips MF RC530 contactless reader IC, capacitively coupled to a 60x45 mm loop antenna, as per the manufacturer's data sheets [24]. Figure 2(a) shows examples of recovered data for two different values of \( d_E \). In Figure 2(a), the two-way communication is clearly visible, while in Figure 2(b), the token's response is noisier but still recoverable using a simple comparator with hysteresis. The token-to-reader communication became indistinguishable from noise when \( d_E \) exceeded 400 cm, even though the reader-to-token communication was still visible. Note that the trace magnitude differences do not accurately reflect signal degradation, as the receiver's amplifier settings were adjusted at each distance to best recover the signal. While we confirmed eavesdropping up to 4 m, our results fall short of the 9 m described in the NIST report. Further improvements in application-specific antennas, signal processing, or a less noisy environment could increase \( d_E \).

### 3.2. Active Scanning

For active scanning, we created an attacking reader by amplifying the carrier and data signal from the reader described in section 3.1 and transmitting it using larger loop antennas. We used the same antennas and wide range receiver as for passive eavesdropping and experimented with different antenna sizes (A5, A4, and A3) and RF amplifiers (0.5 W, 1 W, 2 W, and 4 W). Reference designs, performance trade-offs, and theoretical limits for these components are publicly available [26, 27].

#### 3.2.1 Reader to Token

We set up each antenna/amplifier combination and measured the maximum distance where we could activate a token. To verify if the token had been powered and received the data correctly, we used a pick-up coil in close proximity to check for the correct response. The results, shown in Table 1, are as expected: \( d_p \) is proportional to the antenna radius and transmitted power. \( d_{R \rightarrow T} \) is not significant since the attacker transmits the reader-to-token data.
