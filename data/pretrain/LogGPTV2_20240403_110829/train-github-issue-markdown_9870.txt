## 📝 When searching in PowerToys Run, show 1 or 2 currently running processes
that match the search string with a high confidence at the top
Often, I use PowerToys Run to open currently running processes and sometimes
they are at the bottom below matches to open programs (often unrelated ones
and even below file results at times). It would be great if some currently
running processes that match are displayed at the top.
