4.1 Consumer Layer (CL)
The Consumer Layer belongs to resource consumers such as IT clients, IoT
smart environments, and other end users using smart things. Consumers at this
layer communicate with smart objects using different communication channels
and edge gateways. These communications enable heterogeneous networks and
large amount of data. Our proposed architecture deals with management of
challengesintroducedbyheterogeneityintermsofmobility,energyconsumption
and network security. Further, it is intended to provide quality of service (QoS)
guarantees by increasing network efficiency and its life time.
4.2 Requirement Assessment Layer (RAL)
The second layer of our proposed architecture deals with assessment of overall
userandnetworkrequirements.Ourproposedarchitecturedividestheserequire-
mentsinthreetypesofmodulesi.e.UserRequirementCollector(URC),Network
RequirementCollector(NRC)andConfigurationAgent(CCA.)Themainfunc-
tionality of (URC) is to collect the user requirements such as sensing needs i.e.
temperature, humidity, air, light etc., number of communicating nodes, static
nodes, mobile nodes and other requirements.
The main functionality of (NRC) is to collect network requirements such as
network size, type of communication, computation and storage requirements,
communication channels and protocol etc.
The main functionality of (CCA) is to make a container configuration file
according to a preset configuration value. Later, this configuration will be used
to select appropriate container to be offloaded among many pre-configured con-
tainers for mobility, energy and security management.
4.3 Resource Control Layer (RCL)
The (RCL) is very important layer of our proposed architecture as it is respon-
sible to control and manage overall task scheduling, offloading and monitoring
process. This layer divides tasks into two modules i.e. task scheduling (TS) and
resource management (RM). (TS) module schedules all task to be offloaded
and (RM) continuously monitors all the available, running and idle containers

ker Layer (RBL) to select, combine, rank and allocate/reserve combination of
resourcesintheformofcontainers.Thislayeralsoprovidesmechanismformoni-
toringresourcecurrentstatusandcontainerinternal/externalmigrationprocess.
Docker provides efficient migration of container images (container-to-container
– internal) or (container-to-VMs – external). Further, it provides real time data
collection and resource isolation by sharing Kernel Instance, Operating System,
and Network Connections.

4.4 Resource Broker Layer (RBL)
The Resource Broker acts as the back bone of our proposed architecture. This
layerworksincoordinationwithResourceControlLayerandResourceMonitor-
ingLayer.Primarilythislayerisusedtorank,reserveandassigncombinationof
resourcestocontainers. This layer also usedtokeep theinformation of available
VMs, containers and requests for resource provisioning.
4.5 Resource Monitoring Layer (RML)
The (RML) is responsible to monitor all running, consumed and available
resources. This layer consists of Clusters and Network Data Centers from where
resources are provisioned. This layer helps resource broker layer and resource
controller layer for task scheduling by giving the information about the current
status of containers.

1 Introduction
A business process model is the graphical representation of an organization’s
business process and an important instrument for Business Process Manage-
ment. When modeling a business process, it is essential to precisely label the
individual elements such that the process is consistent and unambiguous. In
the case of domain-specific processes, this might require using a specialized and
sometimes technical vocabulary, which often turns out to be challenging. There
are a lot of tools supporting the modeling of business processes in a graphical
notation such as Business Process Model and Notation or Petri Nets. Usually,
theyaregraphicaleditorsprovidingtheuserwitharepositoryofsymbols,which
representthebuildingblocksoftheunderlyingmodelinglanguage[12].However,
business process modeling remains time-consuming and error-prone, especially
for inexperienced users. The modeling task can be facilitated by providing fea-
tures which assist users during modeling and make recommendations on how to
complete a business process model that is being edited [8]. The basis for such
a recommendation feature could be a repository of completed business process
models.

Onepossiblerecommendationapproachinbusinessprocessmodelingisactiv-
ity recommendation [17]. Given the business process model being worked on,
the recommendation system makes suggestions regarding suitable activities to
extend the model at a user-defined position. In other words, the system recom-
mends proper activities to support the user modeling business processes in an
iterative way. Figure1 shows an example of a business process model that is
currently developed. The user has just added the sequence flow with label ‘Yes’.

we compare it against one alternative approach.
2 Related Work
An overview of recommendation methods for business process modeling is pre-
sented in [11]. Kluza et al. distinguish between a subject-based classification,
A Rule-Based Recommendation Approach for Business Process Modeling 27
whichconcentratesonwhatisactuallysuggested,andacomplementaryposition-
based classification, which focuses on the position where the suggestion is to be
placed. According to their categorization, our work falls into the category of
full-name suggestion for an element. The evaluation method that we use in the
experimental studies corresponds to a forward completion approach.
There are several works that abstract a business process model to a directed
graph and use graph-mining techniques to extract structural patterns from the
process repository. While Cao et al. [3] calculate the distance between patterns
and the partial business process based on graph edit distance [2], Li et al. [14]
propose an efficient string edit distance [13] based similarity metric which turns
the graph-matching problem into a string matching problem. Different distance
calculation strategies are compared by Deng et al. [7].
An approach that involves semantic information and patterns observed in
other users’ preferences is proposed by Koschmider et al. [12]. They present a
business process modeling editor with two features. First, the editor allows the
user to search for process model fragments via a query interface, which is based
on semantic annotations. Second, the system recommends appropriate process
modelfragmentstothemodelbeingedited,whichisbasedonthecombinationof
several aspects as the frequency a process part has been selected by other users
oritsprocessdesignquality.Intwoexperiments,theauthorsprovetheusefulness
andefficiencyoftheireditor.However,theevaluationwasbasedonacomparably
small repository of process fragments that were developed particularly for the
study’s modeling exercise.
In [17], Wang et al. present their embedding-based activity recommenda-
tion method RLRecommender which extracts relations between activities of the
process models and embeds both activities and relations into a continuous low-
dimensional space.Thetraining model usedisbasedonTransE[1]. Theembed-
ded vectors for activities and relations and their distances in the space are then
used to recommend an appropriate activity.
Jannach et al. [10] propose different recommendation techniques to provide
modeling support for users in the specific area of data analysis workflows and
evaluatethemusingapoolofseveralthousandexistingworkflows.Theusersup-
port consists of recommending additional operations to insert into the currently
developedmachinelearningworkflowandishencesimilartoactivityrecommen-
dation. In a laboratory study, the authors show that their recommendation tool
helps users to significantly increase the efficiency of the modeling process.
3 A Rule-Based Recommendation Approach
Following [17], we frame the activity recommendation problem in terms of a
knowledge graph completion task (sometimes also referred to as link predic-
tion).Withinthisframework,theprocessesoftherepositoryandtheincomplete
process are represented as a (large) graph consisting of triples (head activity,
relation, tail activity) and the recommendation of an appropriate activity has
to be understood as the completion task. Within the last decade, the knowl-
edge graph completion task has received lots of attention and the majority of
