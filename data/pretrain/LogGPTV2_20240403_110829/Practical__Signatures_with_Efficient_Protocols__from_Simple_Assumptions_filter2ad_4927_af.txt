We stress that the proofs can be easily adapted to the

5.2 Comparison with Existing Schemes
Table 1 compares our scheme with previous practical
group signatures based on pairing-related assumptions.
Since we focus on practical schemes, we only consider
those in the random oracle model. To make the com-
parison possible, we use 256-bit group orders, so that
elements of G and Zp are encoded using 256 bits each.
The scheme of Boneh, Boyen and Shacham [14] is
the ﬁrst scheme providing short signatures: each signa-
ture is comprised of 3 group elements and 6 elements of
Zp. However, this scheme is designed for static groups
only and relies on the Strong Diﬃe-Hellmann assump-
tion, which is a non-standard q-type assumption, and its
anonymity is only proved in the CPA sense.
Delerabl´ee and Pointcheval [27] presented a scheme
designed for a dynamically growing group and which is
also fully (i.e., CCA) anonymous. The security of their
scheme is based on the eXternal Diﬃe-Hellman assump-
tion (XDH), which we also use here, and the q-SDH as-
sumption.
In [27], each signature consists of 4 group
elements and 5 scalars in Zp, which leads to the same
signature size as previously. They also proposed a vari-
ant to get rid of the XDH assumption at the cost of 2
more group elements and one more scalar, but they still
rely on the q-SDH assumption.
Bichsel et al. [12] proposed a very short group signa-
ture for dynamic groups, where each signature consists
of 3 group elements and 2 elements in Zp. The downsides
are their use the LRSW assumption [42], which is a very
ad-hoc interactive assumption, and their security notion
is not fully-anonymous, but is an hybrid security with
selﬂess-anonymity, which is marked “CCA-” in Table 1.
Another caveat is that, unlike the two previous systems,
the opening complexity of their scheme is linear in the
number of group members.
In 2015, Pointcheval and Sanders [46] gave another
instantiation of [12] based on a variant of the LRSW as-
sumption in the asymmetric setting (meaning using only
Type III pairings), which provides even shorter signa-
tures than [12] with the same downsides. Their scheme

Table 1: Comparison between diﬀerent group signature schemes
provides signatures composed of only 2 group elements
in G and 2 scalars in Zp.
Our main contribution compared to these schemes is to
provide size-comparable signatures – we recall that our
scheme is composed of 7 group elements and 3 scalars
in Zp – while relying on standard, constant-size assump-
tions. Moreover, we can notice that we can save one
element in G at the expense of a linear-time opening al-
gorithm in the number N of group users (like [12]).
