To effectively implement CIS Control 8.1, which focuses on establishing and maintaining an audit log management process, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Define Logging Requirements**: Develop a comprehensive logging policy that outlines the specific requirements for collecting, reviewing, and retaining audit logs. This policy should cover all relevant enterprise assets, including networks, systems, and applications.

2. **Collect Audit Logs**: Ensure that all critical systems and devices are configured to generate and collect audit logs. These logs should capture essential information such as user activities, system events, and security-related incidents.

3. **Review and Analyze Logs**: Establish a routine process for reviewing and analyzing audit logs. This can be done manually or with the help of automated tools. Regular reviews help in identifying potential security issues, anomalies, and suspicious activities.

4. **Retain Logs Securely**: Define and enforce retention policies for audit logs. Ensure that logs are stored securely and are protected from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion. The retention period should comply with regulatory and organizational requirements.

5. **Document and Update Processes**: Document the audit log management process, including roles and responsibilities, procedures, and any tools used. Review and update this documentation annually, or whenever significant changes occur in the organization that could impact the safeguard.

6. **Align with Security Functions**: Recognize that CIS Control 8.1 is categorized under the "Protect" function within the cybersecurity framework. Ensure that the audit log management process aligns with other protective measures and supports the overall security strategy of the organization.

By following these steps, an organization can establish a robust and effective audit log management process, enhancing its ability to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.
