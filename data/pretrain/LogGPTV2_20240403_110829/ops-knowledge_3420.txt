User: You need to set up remote desktop login for an Ubuntu server for easy management. Please list your preparation and setup steps and explain what they do.
Assistant: Preparations: 1. Make sure the server is connected to the network and has an available IP address. 2. Confirm that the ubuntu-desktop software package and necessary dependent libraries have been installed. 3. Make sure the security group is set to allow port numbers for remote desktop connections. Setting steps: 1. Install the Xrdp software package, which is used to specify the use of remote desktop login. sudo apt-get install xrdp 2. Check whether the Xrdp service is started. sudo systemctl status xrdp 3. If the service is not started, you can use the following command to start the service. sudo systemctl start xrdp 4. Set Xrdp as a service that starts automatically at boot. sudo systemctl enable xrdp 5. Set the linux server to enable port number 3389 remote desktop connection. sudo ufw enable sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp 6. Add and authorize users who need to log in. sudo adduser username sudo adduser username ssl-cert sudo adduser username systemd-journal 7. Restart the Xrdp service for the changes to take effect. sudo service xrdp restart Function description: By setting remote desktop login, we can remotely access the Ubuntu server, so as to manage and operate the server locally, including installation, setting, file transfer and other operations, which greatly improves the management efficiency and convenience. Each step in the setup steps plays an important role. They ensure that the Xrdp service can run normally, the ubuntu-desktop package and the necessary dependent libraries have been installed, the security group has allowed the port number of the remote desktop connection, and the specific Users are added and assigned the necessary permissions.
