tems further provide the driver with video outputs on the

Blinding Attack
Our attack is based on the assumption that CMOS/CCD
sensors can be disturbed by malicious optical inputs, and
will produce unrecognizable images. The broken images will
further inﬂuence the decision of ADAS unit and indirectly
a↵ect vehicle control. As a consequence, it will lead to the
car’s deviation, or an emergency brake, which could all pos-
sibly cause crashes.

Description
A common method to attack video equipments is laser
blinding. Photoelectric sensors are very sensitive to the in-
tensity of light. With a peak adsorption coeﬃcient at gen-
erally 103 to 105, most of the laser energy at the sensor can
be absorbed. The time necessary for damaging photoelec-
tric sensor is one to several orders of magnitude less than
the time for harming human eyes.
Under laser exposure,
the surface temperature will rise rapidly due to the thermal
stress caused by non-uniform temperature ﬁeld. Avalanche
breakdown of semiconductor materials can cause irreversible
damage to the photoelectric devices. Camera exposure to
laser radiation for vehicles running on the road can happen
when LiDARs are nearby. LEDs can also be used to gen-
erate bright light against cameras. In our experiment, we
used three kinds of light sources, i.e., LED, visible laser,
and infrared LED.
Figure 11: Setup of camera blinding experiment. A
is a calibration board, B is a camera, C1 and C2 are
laser emitters.
Experiment setup for blinding attack is illustrated in Fig-
ure 11. A calibration board A is positioned 1 meter in front
of camera B; laser sources are either pointed at the camera
or at the calibration board as C1 and C2. C1 is of 15◦ to
the axis of A–B, and C2 of 45◦. We have tested with 650nm
red laser, 850 nm infrared LED spot, and LED spot of 800
mW power respectively, observed the camera image output,
and measured the change of tonal distribution.

Results
LED. Aiming LED light at the calibration board leads
to increased tonal value in the center area, thus information
in this area can be fully concealed, and recognition will no
longer be possible. Aiming LED light directly at the camera
will induce signiﬁcantly higher tonal values, and cause com-
plete blindness all over the image. There is no way the cam-
era system can acquire any visual information. The blinding
time is relevant to camera refresh rate, as well as the distance
between light source and camera. The results are shown in
Figure 12.
Laser. Pointing laser beam at the calibration board have
almost no e↵ect on the camera. However, pointing directly
toward the camera will lead to complete blindness for ap-
proximately 3 seconds, during which the recognition will be
impossible. We further did another experiment with wob-
bling laser beam to emulate handhold attacks or uninten-
tional scenarios. As shown in Figure 13(b), it can also cause
failure of camera image recognition, though the tonal values
are not as high due to shorter exposure time at one spot of
CMOS/CCD chip.
Permanent Damage. When laser beam is directly radi-
ated at the camera within 0.5 meter and for a few seconds,
irreversible damage can be caused to the CMOS/CCD chip.
The black curve in Figure 13(c) is the evidence. When the
laser is turned o↵, the curve still remains, as in Figure 13(d).
Therefore the damage is permanent and irreversible, and can
only be ﬁxed by replacing the CMOS/CCD component. Un-
intentional damage of this kind can possibly be caused by
nearby laser radars.
Infrared LED. No e↵ect on the camera has been ob-
served by pointing the infrared LED spot either at the cam-
era or board. We assume it is due to narrow frequency band
of ﬁlters on the camera, which is a sign of good hardware
quality.

DISCUSSION
In this section we will discuss the feasibility of our attacks
on ultrasonic sensors, MMW Radars, and cameras, from the
perspectives of security research and launching real attacks
on the road. Based on our experience and limited expertise,
we propose countermeasures against these attacks. In the
end we conclude the limitations of our work, and calls for
new ﬁndings in the future.
8.1
Attack Feasibility
We are going to evaluate the feasibility of our attacks by
means of inﬂuential factors, knowledge threshold, hardware
cost, detection by system and driver.
8.1.1
Inﬂuential Factors
The attack success rate is a↵ected by many factors includ-
ing the distance, angle, weather, surroundings, equipment
performance, and sensor design after all. We are only going
to discuss distance and angle.
Distance.
In ultrasonic attacks, jamming is normally
kept within 1 meter due to atmospheric attenuation and
high jamming noise amplitude required.
Spooﬁng can be
done within several meters. The distance can be increased
with equipments that generate higher sound pressure and
narrower beam pattern. For radar and camera attacks, max-
imum distance is not measured due to location limitations,
which will be discussed later.
Angle. In ultrasonic attacks, best performance is achieved
at perpendicular. This is easy to understand because sound
is longitudinal wave, and will project most of its energy in
the forward direction. However, up to 75◦ to the sensor per-
pendicular axis works when spooﬁng attack aims to create
a ghost target. Angle is not tested for camera and Radar
attacks.
8.1.2
Knowledge Threshold
To attack a sensor, certain knowledge threshold must be
reached, which includes the system model, working princi-
ple, relevant physics, and skills to build or operate hardware
equipments. Since attack methods on one kind of sensors can
hardly be reused when dealing with another kind, learning
and researching has to start over, which can be pretty time-
consuming. Among the three sensors we studied, ultrasonic
is the easiest to approach, and Radar the hardest.
8.1.3
Hardware Cost
For ultrasonic sensors, an Arduino and transducer cost
$23, and even cheaper if one makes his own. A laser pointer
of a few dollars can cause permanent damage to the camera,
no matter it is on or o↵. However, for MMW Radar, there
is no o↵-the-shelf tools. General equipments like the ones
we used cost more than the Tesla Model S.
8.1.4
Detection by System
For all of our attacks described in this paper, no alarm
of “malicious attack” or “system failure” from the system is
given. Under ultrasonic attacks, the system either displays
the spoofed distance, no detection, or no display at all. In-
terestingly, in [18] it is said that in the presence of ultrasonic
noise, “the system responds as rule by indicating a fault to
the driver or a pseudo-obstacle at a distance that is less than
potentially real obstacles.” Recall that for jamming attack,
the distance is falsiﬁed to maximum (means no detection),
whereas no alarm is given at all. Under radar attack the
detected object disappears, but no alarm of radar system
error or of any kind is given, and the Autopilot mode is not
forced o↵.
8.1.5
Detection by Driver
Detection of ultrasonic attack and radar attack by the
driver is not likely due to the imperceptibility of ultrasound
and MMW radio. Camera attack using laser is very likely to
be discovered, unless the damage has been done in advance.
There are chances that the driver become suspicious to the
equipments, therefore it is necessary to carefully hide the
equipments or reduce their size.
8.1.6
On Road Attack
We think on road attacks are possible. Ultrasonic jammer
can be hidden in a ﬁxed cover or held by hand. Radar equip-
ments can be hidden at the roadside for ﬁxed-spot attack,
or in the trunk or in a van for mobile attack, and only leave
the tiny antenna outside for concealment. Laser pointer or
dazzler can be placed similarly.
8.2
Countermeasures
From the sensor side of view, jamming attacks can be eas-
ily recognised, especially for ultrasonic sensors and radars,
because there are very few sources of ultrasonic and MMW
radio noise in the working environment, especially with high
power that can make measurements impossible. Many sen-
sor applications have been implemented with noise rejection,
but are not designed with the security concern of malicious
jamming, as well as spooﬁng.
On the systems side that take sensors as input, we suggest
using multiple sensor for redundancy check, such as ultra-
sonic MIMO system. We also suggest adding randomness
into control parameters, taking logic check, conﬁdence pri-
ority, and attack detection system into consideration when
designing sensor data fusion strategy.
8.3
Limitations and Future Work
For ultrasonic sensors, we hope to increase the attack
range by developing equipments with better performance,
and carry on the ultrasound cancellation system. For MMW
Radars, we were not able to test the attack performance in
di↵erent distances and angles due the limitation of the test
yard. We hope to test further in an open ﬁeld and when the
Tesla is moving. For cameras we hope to research more on
the feasibility of spooﬁng attacks.
Besides, for most of the attacks we were only able to ob-
serve the results from the vehicle display rather than from
sensors themselves, and therefore not sure where the prob-
lems originate, i.e., from the sensors or the ECUs. We hope
to further analyze the automated driving system, and moni-
tor all the states for better comprehension of security on the
system level.

CONCLUSIONS
This paper exhibits that sensor security is an realistic issue
to the safety of autonomous vehicles. Three essential kinds
of sensors that Automated Driving Systems rely on and have
been deployed on Tesla vehicles with Autopilot are stud-
ied and examined, i.e., ultrasonic sensors, Millimeter Wave
Radars, and cameras.
Jamming attacks and spooﬁng at-
tacks have been launched against these sensors indoors and
outdoors, and caused malfunction in the automotive system,
all of which could potentially lead to crashes and impair the
safety of self-driving cars.
