User: I created independent python app using cxfreeze under linux and can run it other machines without python and other dependencies. 
But while doing it for mac OS X, in other machines the app searches for the following python installed location which actually present in the machine where it is frozen.
"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1/Python"
How to execute this app without this dependency?
Assistant: Is py2app supports python 3 version?
