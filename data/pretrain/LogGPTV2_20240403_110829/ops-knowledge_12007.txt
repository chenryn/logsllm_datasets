User: I decided to rewrite all our Bash scripts in Python (there are not so many of them) as my first Python project. The reason for it is that although being quite fluent in Bash I feel it's somewhat archaic language and since our system is in the first stages of its developments I think switching to Python now will be the right thing to do.
Are there scripts that should always be written in Bash? For example, we have an init.d daemon script - is it OK to use Python for it?
We run CentOS.
Thanks.
Assistant: Certain scripts that I write simply involving looping over a glob in some directories, and then executing some a piped series of commands on them.  This kind of thing is much more tedious in python.
