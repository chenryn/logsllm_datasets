must be resolved in advance. As such, the IP addresses for the DoH resolvers
are not always the same as DNS and DoT resolvers. We note that the latencies
for the default resolvers are particularly low because these resolvers are often
DNS forwarders conﬁgured on home routers. We exclude measurements with
ﬁve failures or with an average latency of zero (0.7% of the total measurements).
We identiﬁed 41 Whiteboxes with median latencies to Resolvers X, Y, and
Z DNS of up to 100 ms, despite median query response times of less than 1
ms. We consulted with SamKnows, and based on their experience, they believed
this behavior could be attributed to DNS interception by middleboxes between
Whiteboxes and recursive resolvers. For example, customer-premises equipment
(CPE) can run DNS proxies (e.g., dnsmasq) that can cache DNS responses to
achieve such low query response times. Furthermore, previous reports from the
United Kingdom indicate that ISPs can provide customer-premises equipment
that is capable of passively observing and interfering with DNS queries [11]. We
found that 29 of these 41 Whiteboxes are connected to the same ISP. We also
identiﬁed two Whiteboxes with median latencies to X, Y, and Z DoH of less
than 1 ms. Lastly, we identiﬁed one Whitebox with median latencies to X, Y,
and Z DoT of up to 100 ms, despite median query response times of less than 1
ms. We analyze the data for these Whiteboxes for completeness.
Domain Names. Our goal was to collect DNS query response times for domain
names found in websites that users are likely to visit. We ﬁrst selected the top
100 websites in the Tranco top-list, which averages the rankings of websites in the
Can Encrypted DNS Be Fast?
449
Alexa top-list over time [13]. For each website selected, we extracted the domain
names of all included resources found on the page. We obtained this data from
HTTP Archive Objects (or “HARs”) that we collected from a previous study [9].
Importantly, we needed to ensure that the domain names were not sensitive in
nature (e.g., pornhub.com) so as to not trigger DNS-based parental controls. As
such, after we created our initial list of domain names, we used the Webshrinker
API to ﬁlter out domains associated with adult content, illegal content, gambling,
and uncategorized content [24]. We then manually reviewed the resulting list. In
total, our list included 1,711 unique domain names.2
Measurement Protocol. The steps we take to measure query response times
from each Whitebox are as follows:
1. We randomize the input list of 1,711 domain names at the start of each hour.
2. We compute the latency to each resolver with a set of ﬁve ICMP ping tests.
3. We begin iterating over the randomized list by selecting a batch containing
ten domain names.
4. We issue queries
for all 10 domain names
in the batch to each
resolver/protocol combination. For DoT and DoH, we re-use the TLS connec-
tion for each query in the batch, and then close the connection. If a batch of
queries has not completed within 30 s, we pause, check for cross-traﬃc, and
retry if cross-traﬃc is present. If there is no cross traﬃc, we move to the next
resolver/protocol combination.
5. We select the next batch of 10 domain names. If ﬁve minutes have passed, we
stop for the hour. Otherwise, we return to step four.
Limitations. Due to bandwidth usage concerns and limited computational
capabilities on the Whiteboxes, we do not collect web page load times while
varying the underlying DNS protocol and resolver. Additionally, while we con-
ducted our measurements, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many people to work
from home. We did not want to perturb other measurements being run with the
Measuring Broadband America platform or introduce excessive strain on the
volunteers’ home networks. Due to these factors, we focus on DNS response
times.
3 Results
This section presents the results of our measurements. We organize our results
around the following questions: (1) How much connection overhead does
encrypted DNS incur, in terms of resolver lookup (in the case of DoH), TCP
connect time, and TLS setup time; (2) How does encrypted DNS perform versus
conventional DNS?; (3) How does network performance aﬀect encrypted DNS

performance?; and (4) How does encrypted DNS resolver performance depend on
broadband access ISP? Our results show that in the case of certain resolvers—to
our surprise—DoT had lower median response times than conventional DNS,
even as latency to the resolver increased. We also found signiﬁcant variation in
DoH performance across resolvers.
3.1 How Much Connection Overhead Does Encrypted DNS Incur?
We ﬁrst study the overhead incurred by encrypted DNS protocols, due to their
requirements for TCP connection setup and TLS handshakes. Before any batch
of DoT queries can be issued with the SamKnows query tool, a TCP connection
and TLS session must be established with a recursive resolver. In the case of
DoH, the resolver’s domain name is also resolved (e.g., resolverX.com). In Fig.
1, we show timings for diﬀerent aspects of connection establishment for DoT
and DoH. The results show that lookup times were similar for all three resolvers
(Fig. 1(a)). This result is expected because the same default, conventional DNS
resolver is used to look up the DoH resolvers’ domain names; the largest median
DoH resolver lookup time was X with 17.1 ms. Depending on the DNS time to
live (TTL) of the DoH resolver lookup, resolution of the DoH resolver may occur
frequently or infrequently.
Next, we study the TCP connection establishment time for DoT and DoH for
each of the three recursive resolvers (Fig. 1(b)). For each of the three individual
resolvers, TCP establishment time for DoT and DoH are similar. Resolvers X and
Y are similar; Z experienced longer TCP connection times. The largest median
TCP connection establishment time across all resolvers and protocols (Resolver
Z DoH) was 30.8 ms.
Because DoT and DoH rely on TLS for encryption, a TLS session must be
established before use. Figure 1(c) shows the TLS establishment time for the
three open resolvers. Again, Resolver Z experienced higher TLS setup times
compared to X and Y. Furthermore, DoT and DoH performed similarly for
each resolver. The largest median TLS connection establishment time across
all recursive resolvers and protocols (Resolver Z DoH) was 105.2 ms. As with
resolver lookup overhead, the cost of establishing a TCP and TLS connection to
Can Encrypted DNS Be Fast?

the recursive resolver for a system would ideally occur infrequently, and should
be amortized over many queries by keeping the connection alive and reusing it
for multiple DNS queries.
Connection-oriented, secure DNS protocols will incur additional latency, but
these costs can be (and are) typically amortized by caching the DNS name of
the DoH resolver, as well as multiplexing many DNS queries over a single TLS
session to a DoH resolver. Many browser implementations of DoH implement
these practices. For example, Firefox establishes a DoH connection when the
browser launches, and it leaves the connection open [16,17]. Thus, the overhead
for DoH connection establishment in Firefox is amortized over time.
In the remainder of this paper we do not include connection establishment
overhead when studying DNS query response times. We omit connection estab-
lishment time for the rest of our analysis because the DNS query tool closes and
re-opens connections for each batch of queries. Thus, inclusion of TCP and TLS
connection overheads may negatively skew query response times.

3.2 How Does Encrypted DNS Perform Compared with
Conventional DNS?
We next compare query response times across each protocol and recursive
resolver. Figure 2 shows box plots for DNS response times across all White-
boxes for each resolver and protocol. “Default” refers to the resolver that is
conﬁgured by default on each Whitebox (which is typically the DNS resolver
operated by the Whitebox’s upstream ISP).
DNS Performance Varies Across Resolvers. First of all, conventional DNS per-
formance varies across recursive resolvers. For the default resolvers conﬁgured
on Whiteboxes, the median query response time using conventional DNS is 24.8
ms. For Resolvers X, Y, and Z, the median query response times using DNS are
452
A. Hounsel et al.
23.2 ms, 34.8 ms, and 38.3 ms, respectively. Although X performs better than
the default resolvers, Y and Z perform at least 10 ms slower. This variability
could be attributed to diﬀerences in deployments between open resolvers.
DoT Performance Nearly Matches Conventional DNS. Interestingly DoT lookup
times are close to those of conventional DNS. For Resolvers X, Y, and Z, the
median query response times for DoT are 20.9 ms, 32.2 ms, and 45.3 ms, respec-
tively. Interestingly, for X and Y, we ﬁnd that DoT performs 2.3 ms and 2.6
ms faster than conventional DNS, respectively. For both of these resolvers, the
best median DNS query performance could be attained using DoT. Z’s median
response time was 7 ms slower. The performance improvement of DoT over con-
ventional DNS in some cases is interesting because conventional wisdom suggests
that the connection overhead of TCP and TLS would be prohibitive. On the other
hand, various factors, including transport-layer optimizations in TCP, as well as
diﬀerences in infrastructure deployments, could explain these discrepancies. It
may also be the case that DoT resolvers have lower query loads than conven-
tional DNS resolvers, enabling comparable (or sometimes faster) response times.
Investigating the causes of these discrepancies is an avenue for future work.
DoH Response Times were Higher Than Those for DNS and DoT. DoH experi-
enced higher response times than conventional DNS or DoT, although this diﬀer-
ence in performance varies signiﬁcantly across DoH resolvers. For Resolvers X, Y,
and Z, the median query response times for DoH are 37.7 ms, 46.6 ms, and 60.7
ms, respectively. Resolver Z exhibited the biggest increase in response latency
between DoH and DNS (22.4 ms). Resolver Y showed the smallest diﬀerence
in performance between DoH and DNS (11.8 ms). Median DoH response times
between resolvers can diﬀer greatly, with X DoH performing 23 ms faster than Z
DoH. The performance cost of DoH may be due to the overhead of HTTPS, as
well as the fact that DoH implementations are still relatively nascent, and thus
may not be optimized. For example, an experimental DoH recursive resolver
implementation by Facebook engineers terminates DoH connections to a reverse
web proxy before forwarding the query to a DNS resolver [4].

3.3 How Does Network Performance Aﬀect Encrypted DNS
Performance?
We next study how network latency and throughput characteristics aﬀect the
performance of encrypted DNS.
DoT Can Meet or Beat Conventional DNS Despite High Latencies to Resolvers,
Oﬀering Privacy Beneﬁts for no Performance Cost. Figure 3 shows that DoT
can perform better than DNS as latency increases for Resolvers X and Y; in
the case of Resolver Z, DoT nearly matches the performance of conventional
DNS. We observe similar behavior with the linear ridge regression models shown
in Fig. 4. As discussed in Sect. 3.2, these results could be explained by transport-
layer optimizations in TCP, diﬀerences in infrastructure deployments, and lower
query loads on DoT resolvers compared to conventional DNS resolvers.
