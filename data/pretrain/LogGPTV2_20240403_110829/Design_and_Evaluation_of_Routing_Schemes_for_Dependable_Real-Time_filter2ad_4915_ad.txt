60 minutes.  The  network  load  is  defined  as the total 
bandwidth reserved for all active real-time connections. 
Since we  fix  bw-req  and t-req as constants, the network 
load depends only on the network capacity and the re- 
quest  arrival  rate  A.  The  relevant  parameters  of  the 
simulation are listed in Table 1, and the values are se- 
lected  while  keeping in mind  the bandwidth  and  time 
constraints of  typical video and audio applications. 
In  the  simulation  study,  we  use  scenario  files  to 
record  the  connection  request  and  release  events  un- 
der  various  bw-req  and X  values, and compare the per- 
formance of  the proposed  schemes by simulating them 
using the same scenario file.  The scenario files are gen- 
erated by  Matlab, and the proposed routing schemes 
are implemented in, and simulated with, ns. 
6.2. Performance Comparison 
We selected four parameters, p  = a = 1, p  = 2, and 
p = 0 for the bounded flooding scheme since increasing 
the flooding area beyond this barely improves the per- 
formance.  We compared three routing schemes for dif- 
ferent  request  arrival rates  X  E  {0.2,0.3, . . . ,1.0}, un- 
der various network configurations.  For convenience, in 
the following discussions, the symbol B F  is used for the 
bounded flooding scheme.  The fault-tolerance capabil- 
ities, Pack-bk,  of  the three routing schemes are plotted 
in Figure 4 and the capacity  overhead in Figure 5 ,  while 
varying traffic patterns and arrival rates.  Pack-bk  is the

probability  of  activating  a  backup  channel  when  the 
corresponding  primary  channel is  disabled  by  a  single 
link failure. 
D-LSR offers the best fault-tolerance among all the 
cases considered  and BF the least in  most cases.  This 
was expected since D-LSR employs the largest amount 
of  information about network status, and BF uses the 
most  limited  information. 
The fault-tolerance of  both  D-LSR  and  P-LSR  de- 
grades  as  the  network  load  increases  for  the  follow- 
ing  reason.  Some  of  the  backups  chosen  by  D-LSR 
or  P-LSR  traverse  longer  paths  to  go  around  those 
links that have backup conflicts.  Longer backups  may 
generate conflicts with other backups established later. 
This negative effect of  longer backups is apparent when 
the  network  load  is  high, since the  more requests for 
other backups  will  arrive before  the longer  backup  is 
rejected  when  the  arrival rate  is  high.  BF does  not 
show this  phenomenon  because  backup route lengths 
are restricted by  the bounding scope. 
All  three  routing  schemes  provided  higher  fault- 
tolerance,  as  shown  in  Figure  4,  when  the  network 
connectivity,  E ,  is high.  When the network  has more 
links,  there  are  more  paths  between  any  t,wo nodes. 
Thus, in a highly-connected  network, a node has more 
candidates  for  a  backup  and  is  more likely  to find  a 
backup  that  has  less  conflicts.  Moreover,  when  the 
network connectivity is high, path selection is less crit- 
ical to fault-tolerance. Since there are many candidate 
routes, even random selection  can find a backup route 
with  small conflicts. 
As  shown  in  Figure  4, when  some DR-connections 
are concentrated on a small number of  nodes, the per- 
formance gap between  D-LSR and P-LSR is more pro- 
nounced.  In such  a  case, some links  may  have  many 
backups while others have very  few.  If  a  node  should 
select  one of  two  congested  links,  P-LSR  cannot  dis- 
tinguish  one from the other, since IIAPLV((1 does not 
provide sufficiently-detailed information. 
A network is said t o  be saturated if all of its resources

are  allocated  to  DR-connections.  A  saturated  net- 
work  cannot  accept  any  more  connections  until  some 
of  the  active  connections  terminate  and  release  their 
resources.  The simulated  network  gets  saturated  as 
X  reaches 0.5  (0.9) for the case of  E  = 3  ( E  = 4).  To 
measure resource overheads of the three proposed rout- 
ing schemes, we define the difference between the num- 
ber of  D-connections without backups and that of  each 
routing  scheme as  capacity  overhead.  Since resources 
are  reserved  for  backup  channels  of  DR-connections, 
the number  of  DR-connections  drops in the saturated 
network.  Thus, the amount of  resources  reserved  for 
backups  could  be  indicated  by  the  percentage  of  de- 
creased number  of  connections that can be accommo- 
dated  under  each  of  the  three  routing  schemes.  As 
shown in the figure, all of  the three proposed  routing 
schemes  decrease  the  network  utilization  by  at  most 
25% when the traffic pattern is uniform, UT, and 20% 
when  the  traffic  pattern  is  not  uniform,  NT.  Recall 
that,  without  backup  multiplexing,  the network  uti- 
lization  would  be  decreased  by  50%  or  more.  What 
is  more  important  is  that  DR-connections  are shown 
to have high fault-tolerance and low capacity overhead 
until  the network  load  reaches  70% of  the maximum 
load. 
We summarize the evaluation results as follows:  (1) 
multiplexed backup channels improve the fault-tolerance 
at the expense of slightly  decreasing the network utiliza- 
tion,  and  (2)  the lower  the  network  connectivity,  the 
more sophisticated  routing  algorithm  is necessary. 
7.  Conclusion 
In  this  paper,  we  proposed  and  evaluated  three 
routing  schemes  to  find  routes  for  the  primary  and 
backup channels of  a dependable real-time connection. 
Two different  methods  are introduced  t o  expand  the 
link-state  database  in  order  t o  include  the  informa- 
tion  about  active  real-time  connections.  Two  link- 
state routing  schemes  discover  backup  routes  with  a 
high level of fault-tolerance at the expense of overhead 
to  maintain  additional  information  in  the  expanded 
link-state database.  By  contrast, the bounded  flood- 
ing  scheme does not  require  distribution  and mainte- 
nance of  link-state information, nor on-line route com- 
putation  (e.g., the  Dijkstra’s  algorithm).  Instead,  it 
is  an on-demand  scheme,  and upon  request  of  a real- 
time connection, the qualified  routes are discovered by 
flooding the special channel-discovery packets within a 
bounded  area. 
Using  extensive  simulations  with  Matlab  and  ns, 
we  evaluated  the  three  routing  schemes  in  terms  of 
fault-tolerance  and  resource-capacity  overhead.  Our 
simulation  results show that  good fault-tolerance  can 
be  achieved at a reasonable  decrease in the number  of 
real-time  connections  that can  be  admitted.  In  addi- 
tion, when the network load is not very high, allocation 
of  spare resources for backup channels does not reduce 
the number  of  real-time  connections that the network 
can accommodate.
