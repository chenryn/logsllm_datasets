User: I have a python script, or should I say a python service which needs to run every day at 3pm. Basically, there is a while True : time.sleep(1) at the end of the file.
I absolutely need this script to execute in a terminal window (because I need the logs). Bonus if the solution makes it possible to run in a tmux window.
I tried cron jobs but can't figure out how to put this in a terminal.
Assistant: Okay, I see what you're saying. I've done some similar stuff in the past.
For the cron to run your script at 3pm and append to a log file you can do that simply like this:
0 15 * * * command >> log # just logs stdout
or 
0 15 * * * command &>> log # logs both stdout and stderr
If you want it in the terminal I can think of two possibilities:

Like you said, you could do a while true loop that checks the time every n seconds and when it's 3pm do something.
Alternately you could set up an API endpoint that's always on and trigger it by some other program at 3pm. This could be triggered by the cron for example.

Personally I also like the convenience of having a tmux or screen to login to to see what's been happening rather than just checking a log file. So I hope you figure out a workable solution for your use case!
