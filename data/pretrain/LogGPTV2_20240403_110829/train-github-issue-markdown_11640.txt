The code in question
If here is no attr('data-target'), it tries to get selector from href. which
caused warning in firefox 23:
    Empty string can't be argument for getElementById();
because some elements that function is fired for have href="#" .
I think it should be correct to make the check like following:
    selector=!/^[\.#:]$/.test(selector) && selector
_also I wonder why it still uses`attr('data-target')` instead of
`data('target')` ?_
