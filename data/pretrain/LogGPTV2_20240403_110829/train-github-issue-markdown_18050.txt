When using a `date` field, say
    ->add('endAt', 'date', array(
            'format' => \IntlDateFormatter::LONG,
            'years' => range(date('Y'), date('Y') + 10),
    ))
all options are translated:
State | Locale | Domain | Id | Message Preview  
---|---|---|---|---  
missing | fr | forms | 2015 | 2015  
missing | fr | forms | 2016 | 2016  
missing | fr | forms | 2017 | 2017  
|  |  |  |  
missing | fr | forms | janvier | janvier  
|  |  |  |  
missing | fr | forms | 1 | 1  
missing | fr | forms | 2 | 2

I don't know if it's really an issue but I don't like seeing red in the web
profiler!
