## IMPORTANT: DevOps Kit (AzSK) is being sunset by end of FY21. More details [here](../../../ReleaseNotes/AzSKSunsetNotice.md)

ServiceBusDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix ScriptService bus clients (senders/receivers) must not use 'namespace' level access policiesA 'namespace' level access policy provides access to all Queues/Topics in a namespace. However, using an access policy at entity (Queue/Topic) level provides access only to the specific entity. Thus using the latter is inline with the principle of least privilege.HighYesNoAccess policies must be defined with minimum required permissionsGranting minimum access ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes operation preformed on the resource in case of access policy key compromise.MediumYesNoAccess policy keys must be protected at restUsing this feature ensures that sensitive data is stored encrypted at rest. This minimizes the risk of data loss from physical theft and also helps meet regulatory compliance requirements.HighNoNoAccess policy keys must be rotated periodicallyPeriodic key/password rotation is a good security hygiene practice as, over time, it minimizes the likelihood of data loss/compromise which can arise from key theft/brute forcing/recovery attacks.MediumNoNoAudit logs for Service Bus entities should be reviewed routinelyAuditing enables log collection of important system events pertinent to security. Regular monitoring of audit logs can help to detect any suspicious and malicious activity early and respond in a timely manner.MediumNoNoSensitive data must be encrypted in transit Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, session-hijacking attacks.HighNoNoExpiry time of SAS token should be minimum requiredIf SAS token gets compromised, unauthorized users can access Service Bus entities. Minimizing the validity period of the SAS token ensures that the window of time available to an attacker in the event of compromise is minimized.MediumNoNoPaired Namespace should be used for disaster recoveryPaired namespace helpful to maintain consistent availability of ServiceBus in case of ServiceBus outage (e.g. throttling, storage issue, subsystem failure) in primary region.MediumNoNoAll users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.MediumYesNoDiagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days.Logs should be retained for a long enough period so that activity trail can be recreated when investigations are required in the event of an incident or a compromise. A period of 1 year is typical for several compliance requirements as well.MediumYesNo
