 Our Proposals

 To conduct a comprehensive survey of 
existing and potential attack behaviors in 
social network sites 
 Identify patterns in such attack behaviors 
 Detect Spammers in a real-world social 
network 
 Review existing solutions, measurement as 
well as defense mechanisms

 Sites such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter are 
consistently among the top 20 most-viewed web 
sites of the Internet 
 In 2008, 83% of the users of social networks have 
received at least one unwanted friend request or 
message 
 A previous study showed that 45% of users on a 
social networking site readily click on links 
posted by their “friend” accounts, even if they do 
not know that person in real life

◦ Facebook administrators claim to have more than 
400 million active users all over the world 
◦ Most Facebook users were grouped in networks, 
where people coming from a certain country, town, 
or school could find their neighbours or peers 
◦ Default privacy setting was to allow all people in the 
same network to view each other’s profiles 
 Facebook deprecated geographic networks in October 
2009

 It is designed as a microblogging platform, where 
users send short text messages (i.e., tweets) that 
appear on their friends’ pages 
 Users are identified only by a username and, 
optionally, by a real name 
 Tweets can be grouped by hashtags, which are 
popular words, beginning with a “#” character 
◦ This allows users to efficiently search who is 
posting topics of interest at a certain time

 900 profiles on Facebook, MySpace, and 
Twitter, 300 created on each platform 
 A honeypot is a ”trap” set to detect, deflect, 
or in some manner counteract attempts at 
unauthorized use of information systems 
 Due to the similarity of these profiles to 
honeypots, these accounts are called as 
honey-profiles

 Facebook 
◦ Joined 16 geographic networks, using a small 
number of manually-created accounts 
◦ Crawled 2,000 accounts at random, logging names, 
ages, and gender for each network 
◦ Randomly mixed this data (names, surnames, and 
ages) and created the honey-profiles 
SIL 765 
19 
 MySpace 
◦ Crawled 4,000 accounts in total 
 Twitter 
◦ Only information required for signing up is a full 
name and a profile name

 No friend requests were sent, but all those that 
were received were accepted 
 Logged every email notification received from the 
social networks, as well as all the requests and 
messages seen on the honey-profiles 
 Scripts ran continuously for 12 months for 
Facebook (from June 6, 2009 to June 6, 2010), 
and for 11 months for MySpace and Twitter (from 
June 24, 2009 to June 6, 2010)

 Honey-profiles did not only receive friend 
requests and messages from spammers, but 
also a surprising amount from legitimate 
accounts.  
◦ In particular, many social network users aim to 
increase their popularity by adding as friends 
people they do not know.  
 On Facebook, since all honey-profiles were 
members of a geographic network it  may be 
that people looking for local “friends” would 
have contacted some of our accounts.

 Bots that only display some spam content on 
their own profile pages. 
 All the detected MySpace bots belonged to 
this category 
SIL 765 
28 
 Bots that post messages to their own feed 
 Messages vary according to the networks 
◦ Facebook: status updates 
◦ Twitter: tweets 
  Spam message is distributed and shown on all the 
victims’ feeds 
 Therefore, the spam campaign reaches only victims 
who are directly connected with the spam bot 
 163 bots on Facebook belonged to this category, 
as well as 341 bots on Twitter 
SIL 765

SIL 765

 Bots that send a direct message to each victim 
  This can be achieved in different ways 
◦ On Facebook, for example, the message might be a post 
on a victim’s wall 
 Most effective way of spamming, because it 
reaches a greater number of users compared to 
the previous two.  
 Eight bots from this category have been detected, 
all of them on the Facebook network.  
SIL 765 
31 
 Bots that send private  
   messages to their victims  
 As for “poster” bots, these messages have to 
be addressed to a specific user 
◦ Difference: Victim is the only one seeing the spam 
message.  
 Fairly common on Twitter, where spam bots 
send direct messages to their victim.

 Two kinds of bot behavior were identified  
◦ Greedy :  Include a spam content in every 
message they send (416) 
◦  Stealthy: Send messages that look 
legitimate, and only once in a while inject 
a malicious message (98) 
 Most spam profiles under observation,  both 
on Facebook and Twitter, sent less than 20 
messages during their life span. 
SIL 765 
34 
 Used machine learning 
techniques to classify spammers 
and legitimate users.  
Developed six features to detect 
whether a given profile belongs 
to a spammer or not. 
SIL 765 
35 
 FF ratio (R) 
◦ The feature compares the number of friend 
requests that a user sent to the number of friends 
she has 
 Unfortunately, the number of friend requests sent is 
not public on Facebook and on MySpace 
 On Twitter, the number of users a profile started to 
follow is public. 
 R = following / followers 
SIL 765 
36 
 URL ratio (U) 
◦ The feature to detect a bot is the presence of URLs 
in the logged messages 
◦ U =( messages containing urls / total messages) 
 Only count URLs pointing to a third party 
site when computing this feature

 Friend Choice (F)

 The Weka framework with a Random Forest 
algorithm was used for the classifier.

 Challenges 
◦ Obtain a suitable amount of data to analyze 
◦  Most profiles are private, and only their friends can 
see their walls 
◦ Geographic networks discontinued in October 2009 
◦  Used data from various geographic networks, crawled 
between April 28 and July 8 2009, to test our approach. 
 Modifications 
◦ R feature not applicable  
SIL 765 
40 
 Trained classifier using 1,000 profiles 
◦ 173 spam bots that contacted honey-profiles 
◦ 827 manually checked profiles 
 From 790,951 profiles 
◦ Detected: 130 
◦ False positive: 7 
 From 100 profiles 
◦ False negative: 0 
 Low number may be due to the fact that 
spam bots typically do not join geographic 
networks 
SIL 765 
41 
 Easier to obtain data than Facebook 
◦ Most profiles are public 
 500 spam profiles picked 
 500 legitimate profiles also picked  
 Modifications:  
◦ Legitimate profiles with a fairly high number of 
followers (e.g., 300), but following thousands of 
other profiles, have a high value of R.  
◦ Therefore, a new feature R’ 
 (R value)/(the number of followers a profile has) 
SIL 765 
42 
 The main problem faced while building the 
system was the crawling speed 
◦ Twitter limited the machine to execute only 20,000 
API calls per hour 
 From March 06, 2010 to June 06, 2010, we 
crawled 135,834 profiles, detecting 15,932 of 
those as spammers. 
◦ False positive: 75

 Social networking sites attracts spammers  
◦ ease of reaching these users 
◦ possibility to take advantage of the information stored in 
their profiles 
 Created a population of 900 honey-profiles on 
three major social networks and observed the 
traffic they received 
  Developed techniques to identify single spam 
bots, as well as large-scale campaigns. 
 These techniques can help social networks to 
improve their security and detect malicious 
users.

 Once a reverse social engineering attack is 
successful, a wide range of attacks such as 
persuading victims to click on malicious links,  
blackmailing, identity theft,and phishing can be done! 
 Can bypass current behavioral and filter-based 
detection techniques that aim to prevent wide-spread 
unsolicited contact.  
 Third, if the victim contacts the attacker, less 
suspicion is raised, and there is a higher probability 
that a social engineering attack (e.g., phishing, a 
financial scam, information theft, etc.) will be 
successful.
