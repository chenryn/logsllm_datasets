5.4 Service Value Networks
Whilethepreviousthreesectionsconsideredstructuralaspects,suchastheanal-
ysis, optimization and evolution of the network, the described methods do not
take into account the participants’ behavior in a service network. For example,
depending on the market mechanism implemented in the service marketplace,
providers might have an incentive to report their service characteristics (such
as price, non-functional attributes, etc.) untruthfully to the system in order to
increase their chance of being allocated. Hence, the market mechanism used in
the marketplace has to be able to handle such behavior and still yield an effi-
cientmarketoutcome.ThisisthefocusoftheeconomicconceptofServiceValue
Networks (SVNs, see [3,14,13]). SVN are defined as “Smart Business Networks
that provide business value by performing automated on-demand composition
of complex services from a steady but open pool of complementary as well as
substitutive standardized service modules through a universally accessible net-
workorchestrationplatform”[14].ThesetupisverysimilartoFig. 1.Themain
constituents of SVNs are service providers which offer atomic or complex ser-
vices, service aggregators that perform the (automatic) composition of (atomic)
services to complex service compositions, and service consumers. The services
aredescribedbyanumberofattributessuchasavailability,throughput,latency,
and price. Consumers request either atomic services or aggregated services with
certain functionalities, and have preferences over the service attributes (e.g. an
acceptable price range, availability thresholds, etc.).
Fig.5. Service Value Network and combination of atomic services to aggregated ser-
vices
The abstract model and topology of service aggregation in SVNs is shown
in Fig. 5. Given that the consumer requests an aggregated service consisting
of two service functionalities, we have two candidate pools of atomic services
from different service providers. From a Mechanism Design perspective, which
is the focus of most current work on SVNs, the question is how we can select a
combinationoftheseatomicservicesoutofthecandidatepoolsthatbestsatisfies
theconsumerrequirements (inFig. 5,thereare 3×2=6 different combinations
for the requested aggregated service). In SVNs, this is implemented through a
“complex service auction” [3]. The main goal of this mechanism is to maximize
thewelfareoftheSVN,whichisthesumofconsumerandproviderutilities.The
provider utility depends on the costs of service provisioning and the revenue for
theservice.Theconsumerutilityiscalculatedasthedifferenceoftheconsumer’s
monetary valuation of the aggregated service and its price. Based on desired
minimum and maximum values for the service attributes, each customer has
a certain valuation (maximum willingness to pay) for a perfect service, i.e. a
service that completely fulfills (or exceeds) the requirements. This valuation is
then multiplied by the score (∈ [0,1]) for the actual aggregated service, which
depends on how close the aggregated service attributes are to the consumers
requirements.
The mechanism implements two steps. In the first step, the calculation of
the allocation, the mechanism computes the different potential combinations of
atomic services to the desired aggregated service (the aggregation operation of
serviceattributesdependsontheattributetype,e.g.thepricefortheaggregated
service is the sum of prices for the atomic services). The mechanism selects the
aggregated service with the highest (positive) difference between consumer val-
uation minus the costs of the atomic services. In the next step, the calculation
of the payments, the mechanism implements a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
payment scheme to determine the actual payments to the providers of the allo-
cated atomic services. In contrast to other payment schemes, the VCG scheme
is desirable as service providers have the incentive to report the attributes and
prices of their services truthfully to the marketplace, without the incentive to
manipulate. This property is achieved by rewarding service providers according
to their relative importance (added value) to the SVN, which means they can
receive an additional discount on their service provisioning price.
Thismechanism,withthedescribedallocationandpaymentcalculations,has
certain desirable properties. For example, it is known to be allocative efficient,
i.e. it selects the best combination of atomic services given the consumer prefer-
ences. Further, as mentioned earlier it is also strategy-proof, which means that
the dominant strategy for service providers is to submit their service attributes
truthfully to the marketplace, as other strategies will not yield better outcomes
for the providers. However, the Impossibility Result by [16] shows that such a
mechanism is not budget-balanced, which means that in certain circumstances
the discounts to the providers together with the price for the allocated atomic
services exceeds consumer payments. In other words, in such case the market
would have to be (externally) subsidized which might not be practical for many
scenarios. On the other hand, implementing other payment schemes to achieve
budget-balanceyieldalossofthestrategy-proofness,i.e.serviceprovidersmight
gain by misrepresenting their service attributes to the SVN which can lead to
complex strategic behavior.

SVN has to provide many (functionally) different services to accommodate for
diverse consumer requirements, Conte et al. [9] propose a scheme that rewards
service providers to participate in SVNs (even if their services are not selected).
Thevalueofeachserviceprovideriscalculatedthroughametricthatisaproxy
for the relative power of the provider in the network. Once service providers
are participating in the SVN, their goal is to be allocated and receive revenues
fromtheirallocatedservices.Asunsuccessfulprovidersmightleavethenetwork,
an important question is how the providers can select or adjust their service
attributes such that they better fit the customer requirements. Haas et al. [13]
show that through appropriate learning strategies, the providers are able to
adjustto(potentiallytime-dependent)consumerrequirements,andareevenable
to tacitly collude by dividing existing market segments among the providers.
While current work on SVNs has mainly focused on economic topics, the
augmentation of the SVN concept with semantic capabilities to an OSSN along
with the use of Social Network Analysis promise to be fruitful. Such an amal-
gamation would enable a better description and usability of SVNs as well as an
improved understanding of their dynamic behavior.

they belong to (c.f. [12,1,10,11,17]). Service networks are not viewed as global
structures. Furthermore, the efforts to analyze networks was carried out as iso-
lated activities from the Business Process Management (BPM) field (e.g. [10])
or from the economical side (e.g. [11,17]), among others.
For example, e3service [12] provides an ontology to model e-business models
and services. The model targets to represent very simple relations between ser-
vicesfromaninternalperspective,e.g.core-enhancing,core-supporting,andsub-
stitute. From an external perspective, the value chains proposed do not capture
explicitlyservicenetworksacrossagentsanddonottrytoanalyzequantitatively
the effect of relationships.
In [10], the authors look at service networks from a BPM and Service Ori-
ented Architecture (SOA) perspectives and present the Service Network Nota-
tion (SNN). SNN provides UML artifacts to model value chain relationships of
economic value. These relationships take the form of what we can call ’weak’
relationships since they only capture offerings and rewards which occur be-
tween services. The notation is to be used to describe how a new service can
be composed from a network of existing services. The focus is on compositions,
processes, and on establishing how new services can be created using BPM to
describe the interactions of existing SOA-based services.
Allee[1]usesagraph-basednotationtomodelvalueflowsinsideanetworkof
agentssuchastheexchangeofgoods,services,revenue,knowledge,andintangi-
ble values. In the same lines, Weill and Vitale [21] have developed a formalism,
called the e-business model schematic, to analyze businesses. The schematic is
a graphical representation aiming at identifying a business model’s important
elements. This includes the firm relationships with its suppliers and allies, ben-
efits each participant receives, and the major flows of product, information, and
money. Both approaches only take into account value flows and do not consider
other types of relationships that can be established between agents.
From a business perspective, there is an apparent trend for companies (e.g.
service providers) to specialize by focusing on core competencies and becoming
amember ofadaptablenetworks[11]. Asthetransition tosuch networksof spe-
cialized service providers leads to challenges and new requirements for business
models and service components, the field of service networks has been identified
as important research priority [17].
Nonetheless, a challenge yet to be solved involves modeling and optimizing
the functions of service-centric organizations from technological, business and
legal points of view, extending work on optimizing Web process [19]. Seman-
tic Web technologies of today will need to be extended to provide or at least
support large-scale modeling, analytics, and optimization. In this regard, new
approaches are need to express and quantify the impact that one service has
on other services, as well as to understand the collective behavior and perfor-
mance/profitability characteristics of service networks.
7 Conclusions
We envision a world that is well connected via global OSSNs. Semantics will
have a major role in creating a large-scale and integrated service network. Or-
ganizations, groups and individuals will have tools and platforms to advertise
their know-how, capabilities and skills in the form of services to the world. A

As service networks emerge, their study will enable to understand how a
service-basedsocietygrowsandchangesovertime.Servicenetworkanalysis(SNA)
can provide theories, mathematical models, algorithms, techniques, and tools to
achieve this goal. This paper presented four applications of SNA: optimization,
evolution, network effect, and service value. Optimization targets to construct
networksofserviceswhichminimizetheoverallcost.Networkevolutionrelieson
time to study and forecast how a network structure will evolve overtime. Net-
work effect explores the impact of changing the characteristics of one or more
service nodes in the other services and in the network itself. Finally, service
value network enable to analyze the influence providers’ strategies in the net-
work. These four methods provide the first building blocks to demonstrate the
