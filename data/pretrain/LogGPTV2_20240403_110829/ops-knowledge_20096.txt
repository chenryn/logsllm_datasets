User: I am trying to utilise mailer.py script to send mails after a SVN Commit. In mailer.py svn module has been used. I think the svn module is present in /opt/CollabNet_Subversion/lib-146/svn-python/svn and I tried to append it to the sys path using sys.path.append. For once it is getting appended and when I do sys.path I can see the appended path but after that the path is removed and I am getting import error: No Module named SVN.
Am I missing something?
Assistant: Like setting environment variable in bash, if you close session it will be disapear.
So just add sys.path.append it will add path in runtime.
