ABSTRACT
Integrated Circuit (IC) device manufacturing is a challeng-
ing task and often results in subtle defects that can render
a chip unusable. To detect these defects at multiple stages
during the IC production process, test modes are inserted
(Design For Testability). On the downside, attackers can
use these test modes to break IC device security and extract
sensitive information such as the ﬁrmware implementation
or secret key material. While in high security smart cards
the testing circuits are physically removed during produc-
tion for this reason, in the majority of digital ICs the testing
modes remain intact. Often they are undocumented, well-
hidden and contain secret test commands. Utilizing search
algorithms and/or side channel information, several attacks
on secret testing modes have been presented lately. Accord-
ingly, countermeasures that frequently rely on obfuscation
techniques have been proposed as more advanced crypto-
graphic methods would require signiﬁcantly more space on
the die and thus cause higher production costs. In this work,
we show that limited eﬀort silicon reverse engineering can
be eﬀectively used to discover secret testing modes and that
proposed obfuscation based countermeasures can be circum-
vented without altering the analysis technique. We describe
our approach in detail at the example of a proprietary cryp-
tographic game authentication chip of a well known gaming
console and present an FPGA implementation of the previ-
ously secret authentication algorithm.

INTRODUCTION
Integrated circuits serve a wide range of purposes ranging
from simple tasks in everyday products to high performance
or security critical applications. Despite their abundant
occurrences, the involved manufacturing processes are still
considered challenging. Increasing design sizes and a con-
stantly decreasing feature size have raised the probability of
producing defective or faulty dies. To avoid additional costs
for further processing defective dies, it is important that IC
test modes such as scan tests [10] are inserted into the de-
sign (Design for Testability - DFT ). In multiple stages of
the manufacturing process, the chip can thus be tested and
eventually discarded in case of production defects. However,
from a security perspective, these testing modes can lead to
a number of threats [3] and jeopardize the overall system se-
curity. For instance, only recently a backdoor has been dis-
covered in the high security ProASIC3 chip family that can
be exploited using the JTAG Test Access Port (TAP) [11].
While at least some hardware test interfaces such as JTAG
Boundary-Scan Test (BST) are standardized [6], their inter-
nal test data structures and test functionalities are strictly
proprietary, as they depend on the actual design that has
been implemented in the integrated circuit. Especially with
JTAG in micro-controllers or FPGAs, it is common that
generic functions are made available to the user (i.e.
for
programming purposes), while the proprietary manufacturer
extensions are well hidden and kept secret [3, 5, 11]. State-
of-the-art attacks typically utilize side-channel information
such as power consumption or EM emission [11, 15, 16] to
ﬁnd hidden commands. Similarly, scan-chain attacks ex-
tract data from the scan based test modes and use search or
brute force algorithms to extract valuable information such
as key material from the stream [3]. To thwart these at-
tacks, protection mechanisms such as scan chain scrambling
[4] or encryption with hard-coded keys [7, 15] have been pro-
posed. In this paper, we show that limited eﬀort deep silicon
analysis can be utilized for proprietary test mode reverse en-
gineering. We demonstrate our approach on a cryptographic
authentication chip in a well known game console. Our ap-
proach leads to the full disclosure of the implemented test
549modes, allowing us to bypass security restrictions and reveal
previously kept device secrets such as the ﬁrmware, the im-
plemented cryptographic algorithm or encryption keys. In
addition, our approach allows us to circumvent proposed
test-mode protection mechanisms depending on hard-coded
key material or secret scrambling mechanisms [4, 5, 7, 15],
since the necessary information can be gathered through sil-
icon reverse engineering as well. Summing up, the contribu-
tions presented in this paper are as follows:
(cid:129) By means of an exemplary authentication chip part of
a well known game console, we show how limited eﬀort
deep silicon analysis can be used to reverse engineer
proprietary test modes, leading to a complete security
breach of the chip.
(cid:129) We present a previously secret cryptographic algorithm
we obtained by reverse engineering the extracted ﬁrm-
ware from the device’s ROM.
(cid:129) We evaluate our ﬁndings by creating a full proof-of-
concept implementation of the disclosed algorithm on
an FPGA development board. Exchanging the pro-
prietary chip in the game console with our FPGA im-
plementation shows that both the retrieved algorithm
and the secret keys are correct.
2. RELATED WORK
Several approaches already recognized the possibility to
reverse engineer a chip’s functionality by investigating test
modes. However, most of them are non-invasive in nature.
In [11], for example, Sergei Skorobogatov and Christopher
Woods explore undocumented JTAG features using sophisti-
cated side channel attacks. To reverse engineer these JTAG
features, they use diﬀerential power analysis and pipeline
emission analysis in combination with varying the content
of data ﬁelds for the instructions. They propose a mitiga-
tion technique that adds noise and better protective shield-
ing. Since our approach uses silicon reverse engineering of
the scan chain logic instead of side channel attacks, it is not
aﬀected by these countermeasures.
In [3], Jean Da Rolt et al. demonstrate an attack on sin-
gle and multiple scan chain structures with or without re-
sponse compaction on an AES crypto-core. This includes
the AES-speciﬁc limitation that only ﬂip-ﬂops that belong
to the round register are supposed to ﬂip between two plain-
texts. The general principle of the used attack consists in
observing the data stored in the round-register after the ex-
ecution of the ﬁrst round for several known plaintexts by
means of scan-out operations, and then, from these obser-
vations, to derive the secret key. This approach requires
read access to (optionally compacted) internal registers via
the scan chain which might be hidden or cryptographically
secured. In contrast, our approach does not share the re-
quirement that the only changing ﬂip-ﬂops would be those
of the round register and also evaluates restricted access to
internal registers.
In [4], David H´ely et al. suggest the use of scan chain
scrambling in combination with a random number genera-
tor to secure the scan chain. This approach depends on the
attacker not being able to predict the random numbers for
the scrambling algorithm. The security of these concepts
can be described as “security-by-obscurity” approach. As
such, this method can easily be reverted by reverse engi-
neering and/or inﬂuencing the random number generator.
Such approaches are not suﬃcient to eﬀectively protect a
chip against reverse engineering but merely raise the bar in
terms of required time and eﬀort.
Invasive reverse engineering was demonstrated in [9] by
Karsten Nohl et al. In this work, the authors discuss au-
tomated reverse engineering of Mifare Classic RFID tags.
They suggest that obfuscation of the implementation could
increase the complexity of circuit detection, but did not in-
vestigate this type of mitigation in detail. Although we use a
similar method of reverse engineering, we speciﬁcally target
the testing logic and not the implementation of the whole
chip.

IC DESIGN AND TEST MODES
When considering digital integrated circuits, their design
process typically starts on the logic level, for instance by us-
ing a hardware description language such as VHDL or Ver-
ilog. The design then undergoes a number of behavioral and
timing related functional simulations to ensure that the im-
plementation is working according to its speciﬁcation. In the
next step, the design is mapped to an actual process tech-
nology and manufacturing process. This may involve using
existing libraries that contain typical design elements such
as memory cells, logic gates or bonding pads. Once the de-
sign is complete, the manufacturing process can start. Using
a silicon substrate wafer, layers involving diﬀerent materi-
als (such as polysilicon, tungsten, aluminium or insulation
oxides) are deposited and selectively removed using litho-
graphic processes to transfer the fabrication patterns onto
the surface, followed by diﬀerent types of wet and dry etch-
ing techniques [14]. Each of these manufacturing processes
can potentially lead to subtle defects that render individual
dies on the wafer unusable. To avoid additional costs (i.e.
packaging, bonding, etc.) from further processing these de-
fective dies, it is important that prior to the IC manufactur-
ing process, IC test modes such as scan chains are inserted
into the design. ASIC designers can leverage dedicated scan
chain insertion tools for this task. Common test modes are
scan chains, JTAG test functions, Built-In Self-Test (BIST)
or proprietary test modes, for instance [10]. After fabri-
cation during the wafer test, this allows the manufacturer
to use probe cards in order to connect to bonding or test
pads of the individual dies on the wafer. By supplying test
vectors and observing the responses, it can be determined
if the chip is working properly. Since chip packaging and
bonding might cause failures on their own, manufacturers
tend to make these test pads available on the outside of the
IC package as well. In the IC datasheets, these pins are then
often labeled as “do not connect”, “test” or “reserved”. If the
test mode is enabled, testing functions such as scan tests
[10] can be performed, while otherwise, the device functions
in its normal intended behavior. Focusing on the security
implications, the following sections provide an overview of
typical test modes for digital integrated circuits.
3.1 Scan Chain
Any synchronous digital logic can be described on the Reg-
ister Transfer Level (RTL). Based on the input data of a
certain register (i.e. a set of ﬂip-ﬂops), the logic circuitry
produces a well-deﬁned output and stores it in subsequent
registers. The less combinational logic is between these reg-

The purpose of the second etch round (i.e. the clean etch) is
to remove the epoxy remainders without causing new ones
from the already dissolved epoxy in the acid bath. After an
etch time of 5 minutes, we removed the die from the beaker
and cleaned it in an acetone bath in an ultrasonic cleaner.
The result was a clean die with some of the bonding wires
still attached. Using ultra-ﬁne tweezers and a razor blade,
we removed them as well.
4.3 Imaging
In a reﬂected light microscope with motorized stage and
digital camera, we took 19x27 (i.e. 513) tiled pictures and
stitched them together using a custom script and the well-
known Hugin software to obtain a detailed 87 Megapixel im-
age. Although a microscope with motorized stage is highly
convenient to take tiled pictures, the motorized stage is not a
requirement. Usable reﬂected light microscopes without mo-
torized stage are now well in the price range for many hob-
byists (i.e. for less than 1,000 US$ on eBay). In our image
analysis, we carefully traced the signals from the bonding
pads to associated logic blocks within the die. This also al-
lowed us to determine whether the pins that were previously
tied to the power rails are supply or potential test-mode
pins.
In addition to the optical microscope, we used our
lab’s Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) whenever greater
detail pictures were helpful. For SEM application, we did
not prepare the dies in any special way other than clean-
ing. Similar to reﬂected light microscopes and with second
hand price tags below 5,000 US$, SEMs are now becoming
aﬀordable for hobbyists or hackerspaces as well.
A heavily scaled down and commented version of the CIC
chip is shown in Figure 6. The numbers on the side represent
the pin numbers of the CIC DIP Package. The image allowed
us to spot typical logic design blocks such as ROM memories
(marked red with letters B and E ), SRAM (marked black
with letter C ) as well as a CPU (marked green with the let-
ter D). Combining the information we obtained earlier with
regard to potential test mode pins, we could now exclude the
power supply pins as well as the clock output pin from the
list of test-mode candidates. This left us with the potential
test-mode pin candidates 2 to 7. However, while the signals
from pins 2 to 5 all led to a register, we could trace pins
6 and 7 to corresponding logic blocks (marked in blue with
Figure 6: Commented CIC Die with Manufacturer
Chip Label CECRN8
letter A). Those pins are thus likely to be test-mode control
pins.
4.4 Detailed Test Mode Reverse Engineering
Within logic block A, we traced the test mode signals from
pins 6 and 7 to the logic block shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7: Proprietary Test Mode Logic
Both signals ﬁrst go through an inverter. After that, both
the inverted as well as the non-inverted signals are available
and used by four AND gates to obtain all possible bit combi-
nations from the two testing pins. Since both pins were tied
to ground on the game cartridge PCB, this leaves 3 possible
testing modes. Tracing these outputs further, we could see
that they control multiplexers as shown in Fig. 8.
However, the source data entering these 4 multiplexers al-
ways comes from one of 3 diﬀerent registers spread across
