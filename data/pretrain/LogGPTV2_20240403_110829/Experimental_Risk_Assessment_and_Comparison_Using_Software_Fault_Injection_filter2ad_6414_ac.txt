## Figure 1: Satellite Data Handling System

Figure 1 illustrates the setup of the satellite data handling system (CDMS). The CDMS consists of six subsystems: Packet Router (PR), Power Conditioning System (PCS), On-Board Storage (OBS), Data Handling System (DHS), Reconfiguration Manager (RM), and Payload (PL).

### Mission Scenario
The mission scenario involves controlling a space telescope and transmitting the collected data to the ground system. The data involved in this scenario is predetermined, allowing for deterministic experiments. The process begins with an acknowledgment command sent from the CDMS to the ground control. Subsequently, the ground control sends a series of commands to the CDMS, requesting telemetry information. The CDMS responds by sending back telemetry information for each command. The timing and content of the telemetry data are used to detect system correctness or failure during the experiments. The ground control software runs on a computer with the Linux operating system.

## 3.1. Estimation of \( \text{prob}(f) \)

RTLinux comprises 2,211 modules with a total of 85,108 lines of code. The interception coefficient (\( \alpha \)) for RTLinux is -7.8443977, calculated using regression as described in Section 2.1. RTEMS, on the other hand, consists of 1,257 modules with a total of 63,258 lines of code, and its interception coefficient is -7.944308.

Table 2 summarizes the metrics evaluation and logistic regression coefficients for both operating systems, showing the global values for each metric and the coefficients (\( \beta_i \)) obtained. These coefficients are used in the logistic equation (Equation 4) to estimate the probability of failure (\( \text{prob}(f) \)) for each component. The global probability of failure (\( \text{probg}(f) \)) estimated for RTLinux is 6.50%, and for RTEMS, it is 7.49%. These values are calculated using Equation 5, as explained in Section 2.1.

A detailed analysis of Table 2 reveals that while RTLinux has higher overall complexity metrics, RTEMS has a higher percentage of modules with high complexity. This results in a higher \( \text{probg}(f) \) for RTEMS compared to RTLinux. Table 3 shows the distribution of module complexity for Lines of Code (LoC) and Complexity metrics.

## 3.2. Estimation of \( \text{cost}(f) \)

The cost of activating residual faults is assessed through the injection of realistic faults into the components under observation (RTEMS or RTLinux) using the G-SWFIT technique, as described in Section 2.2.

### Fault Injection
We identified 231 faults for the RTEMS setup and 341 faults for RTLinux. Each fault is injected separately and remains present throughout the experiment, reflecting the nature of permanent software faults. Each fault injection represents a new experiment, involving the execution of the entire workload.

### Results
Figures 2 and 3 show the failure modes obtained from the fault injection campaigns in both operating systems. Table 4 presents the risk evaluation, considering each failure mode and the combination of all erroneous failure modes (Incorrect Behavior column in Table 4).

RTLinux generally represents a higher risk than RTEMS for most failure modes, making RTEMS a better choice for this application. However, RTLinux shows a lower risk of wrong results, indicating a more frequent fail-silent behavior. Since both operating systems have Posix-compliant APIs, the differences in measured risk can be attributed to the operating system itself.

## 4. Related Work

Risk assessment approaches typically address risk management in software development projects [27, 19] and relate risk estimation to quality models, heuristics, and developers' experience [4, 34, 38]. In high-demand application areas like avionics or nuclear power plants, risk estimation is closely tied to safety and reliability assessments, governed by strict industrial standards [15]. Architectural-level risk analysis is also popular, especially in early development phases [37, 32, 45].

Despite extensive research, estimating the risk associated with a given component remains challenging due to the difficulty in assessing dynamic behavior without experimentation. Our proposed method combines recent software fault injection techniques [10, 11] with established software complexity metrics [25, 40]. We estimate the probability of residual software faults in the component and use software fault injection to evaluate the cost of possible component failures in the system.
