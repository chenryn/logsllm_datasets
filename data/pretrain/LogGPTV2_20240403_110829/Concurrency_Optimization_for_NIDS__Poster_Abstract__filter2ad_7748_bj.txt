In this study, ambient fine particles (diameter less than 2.5 μm; PM2.5) were collected from urban cities in China and Korea (i.e., Beijing and Gwangju, respectively) during January 2018. The dichloromethane (DCM) extracts of the PM2.5 samples were analyzed using an ultrahigh-resolution (UHR) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer to identify the molecular characteristics of organic aerosols collected during wintertime in both urban areas.

The FT-ICR MS analysis of the water-insoluble organic fractions (WIOCs) revealed that CHO and CHON class species comprised more than 90% of the total WIOCs. Haze events with high organonitrate proportions were observed at both sites. However, the CHON proportions at the Beijing site showed no correlation with secondary ionic species and gaseous components, suggesting that nitrogen-containing organics originate from primary sources. In contrast, the proportion of CHON class species at the Gwangju site positively correlated with the concentrations of gaseous nitric acid and ammonia, indicating that ambient nitrate and ammonia play a role in the atmospheric formation of nitrogen-containing organic compounds at this site. Notably, significant proportions of CHN compounds were observed at the Beijing site, while negligible amounts were detected at the Gwangju site.

Two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS) analysis identified quinoline class compounds and their corresponding -CH2 homologous series in the WIOC at the Beijing site. The interpretation of molecular changes in urban organic aerosols using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and meteorological information provides valuable insights into understanding ambient organic aerosols.

### P-321: Equine Atypical Myopathy: Targeted Metabolomic Study

**Presenting Author:** Radana Karlíková, IMTM, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic

**Co-Authors:** Petr Jahn, Jitka Široká, David Friedecký, Marek Mech, Lucie Mádrová, Hana Janečková, Františka Hrdinová, Tomáš Adam

Equine multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as atypical myopathy (AM), is a highly fatal muscle disease in grazing horses. This syndrome is characterized by muscular weakness, acute myonecrosis, and myoglobinuria, leading to death in at least 75% of cases within 72 hours. AM is caused by the ingestion of *Acer Pseudoplatanus* seeds containing hypoglycin A, whose active metabolite, MCPA-CoA, inhibits FAD-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenases.

The aim of this work was to compare the serum metabolomic profile of horses suffering from AM with controls and to confirm AM diagnosis in the blood of a newborn foal. Metabolomic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography with an aminopropyl column coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (QTRAP 5500, AB Sciex). Metabolites were detected by multiple reaction monitoring in both positive and negative modes and statistically evaluated using R software. Specific biomarker MCPA-carnitine was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using the UltiMate 3000 system with a BEH C18 column (50 mm, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm) coupled to a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Triple Quad 6500; SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA).

Significant differences were observed in the concentrations of various glycine conjugates and acylcarnitines (C2–C26). Additionally, the concentrations of purine and pyrimidine metabolites, vitamins, and selected organic and amino acids were altered in horses with AM. Metabolomic analysis of the foal’s blood revealed increased concentrations of acylcarnitines and MCPA-carnitine, consistent with the metabolic profiles of blood from AM-affected horses. This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation Grant [18-12204S] and NPU I (LO1304).

### P-322: Optimization of Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Liquid Chromatography (LCxLC) for Lipidomic Analysis of Zebrafish

**Presenting Author:** Mengmeng Xu, VU University, Netherlands

**Co-Author:** Pim Leonards

**Background:** Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) has become the standard method for lipid analysis. Common LC phases include reverse-phase (RP) LC, normal-phase (NP) LC, and hydrophilic interaction (HILIC) phases. However, one-dimensional LC (1DLC) is insufficient to cover the lipidome due to co-elution. Two-dimensional LC (2DLC) improves separation power before MS detection.

**Methods:** The orthogonality of separation mechanisms is crucial in 2DLC (LC×LC). HILIC and RPLC were selected due to their solvent compatibility. A RPLC C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 2.6 µm) was used as the first dimension column, and a HILIC column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 µm) as the second dimension column. The combination of HILIC×RPLC was also tested. A QTOF MS system was used for lipid detection. Zebrafish eggs and larvae were analyzed.

**Results:** RPLC separated lipids based on their hydrophobic character, fatty acyl chain length, and the number and positions of double bonds. HILIC separated lipids based on the polar head groups of specific lipid classes. The 2DLC analysis of zebrafish samples showed the separation of various lipid classes (e.g., LPC, PC, PE, PI, PA, PS, DAG, TAG), and over 1000 lipids were detected. The separation was significantly improved compared to 1DLC. Comprehensive 2DLC is a promising method for lipid characterization in complex biological samples.

### P-323: Insights into the Toxicity of Propazine on Freshwater Microalgae *Chlorella Vulgaris* (CV) and *Scenedesmus Obliquus* (SO): Untargeted Metabolomics via LC-QTOF

**Presenting Author:** Hiranya Dayal, National University of Singapore, Singapore

**Co-Author:** Sam Li Fong Yau

This study aims to utilize untargeted metabolomics using LC-QTOF to elucidate the impact of propazine on freshwater microalgae. Freshwater microalgae are commonly used in biomonitoring and ecotoxicology studies. The toxicity of propazine was studied at concentrations ranging from 10 µg/l to 10 mg/l over 5 days on two freshwater microalgae, *Chlorella vulgaris* (CV) and *Scenedesmus obliquus* (SO).

The growth rate of CV showed a gradual, dose-dependent decline, while the growth of SO was significantly inhibited from 5 mg/l of propazine. Preliminary results indicate that in CV, exposure resulted in a slow increase in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) levels over time, possibly attributed to enhanced membrane lipid synthesis. In contrast, MGDG and DGDG levels decreased in SO from 100 µg/l, reaching significance at 5 mg/l, which correlates with the observed growth inhibition at the same exposure level.

Fluorescence-based assays for reactive oxygen species (ROS) showed a gradual decrease in cellular ROS for CV with propazine exposure, indicating that while the growth rate of CV was slowed, some protection from further oxidative stress was provided by reinforcing the cell membrane. Meanwhile, a significant increase in ROS was observed in SO from 5 mg/l propazine, implying its limitations in tolerating environmental stress due to propazine. These results demonstrate that different microalgae have varying tolerances to propazine exposure and highlight the utility of metabolomics in complementing biochemical assays for assessing the environmental impact of herbicides on microalgae.

### P-324: Framework for Damage Assessment of *Oryza Sativa* After Chemical Accident Using Metabolic Effect Level

**Presenting Author:** Woojung Kim, School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea

**Co-Author:** Sangdon Kim

Changes in the metabolome reflect specific cellular responses after chemical exposure, making post-accident damage assessment based on metabolomics a better alternative to physiological approaches. The Ministry of Environment attempted to characterize plant damage using metabolomics, but the target metabolite selection process was unclear, and the exposure method did not reflect the chemical accident scenario, limiting practical use. To overcome these limitations, untargeted metabolomics and a vapor exposure chamber were introduced in this study.

Toluene was selected based on accident frequency and hazards. *Oryza sativa* was exposed in a vapor exposure chamber, and metabolic responses were analyzed using LC-QToF-MS-based untargeted metabolic profiling. Multivariate statistical analysis and readable endpoints were used to evaluate the data. Principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis were used to analyze the exposed concentration-based and recovery time-based metabolic response patterns. Additionally, the weight of shoot and root, and the chlorophyll content of leaves were assessed.

Overall, the results of multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated several potential biomarkers characterized by the metabolomic approach, providing insights into quantitative chemical accident damage assessment.

### P-325: Metabolomics Reveals Kidney Damage in Mice Exposed to Thirdhand Smoke

**Presenting Author:** Carla Merino Ruiz, MIL@B - CIBERDEM - URV, Spain

**Co-Authors:** Sara Samino, Beatrix Paton, Neema Adhami, Manuela Martins-Green, Xavier Correig, Noelia Ramírez

Thirdhand smoke (THS) is a poorly understood pathway of tobacco exposure produced by the deposition and aging of tobacco smoke particles and toxicants on surfaces, becoming progressively more toxic. Recent studies have revealed the harmful health effects of THS exposure, but its effects on the kidney have not been studied. We applied untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics of the kidney and metabolomics of urine from mice exposed to THS under conditions mimicking exposure in smokers' homes, using a multiplatform approach (UHPLC-QTOF and GC-QTOF).

Kidneys from THS-exposed mice had significantly lower levels of betaine, a well-known kidney osmoprotectant. Different metabolites from pyrimidine metabolism and intermediates of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism were also depleted in THS-exposed kidneys. Several metabolites of the kynurenine pathway related to chronic kidney disease were upregulated in the urine of THS-exposed mice. Lipidomics analysis of kidneys showed that levels of different acylcarnitines, important in energy metabolism, and several lipids, such as glycerophosphocholines and sphingomyelins, were considerably lower in THS-exposed kidneys, indicating an impairment in energetic lipid metabolism.

Interestingly, not all metabolites altered by THS exposure returned to near-control levels after antioxidant treatment, suggesting that the harmful effects of THS cannot easily be reversed. This study demonstrates for the first time that THS exposure is a latent risk for the development of kidney disease. If confirmed in humans, these findings would provide major evidence to enforce tobacco control policies.

### P-326: Metabolic Effects of Perinatal Exposure to a Low-Dose Pesticide Cocktail in Mice: Sexual Dimorphism and Impact on Gut Microbiota

**Presenting Author:** Lorraine Smith, INRA Toxalim, France

**Co-Authors:** Lorraine Smith, Wendy Klement, Sharon Barretto, Frederic Lasserre, Celine Lukowicz, Frederic De-Bock, Benjamen Maillard, Bruno Patris, Emilien Jamin, Laurent Debrauwer, Laila Mselli-Lakhal, Herve Guillou, Nicolas Marchi, Laurence Gamet-Payrastre, Sandrine Ellero-Simatos

Epidemiological evidence suggests a link between pesticide exposure and the development of metabolic diseases. We previously showed a sexually dimorphic impact of chronic dietary exposure to a low-dose cocktail of six pesticides (boscalid, captan, chlorpyrifos, thiofanate, thiacloprid, and ziram) on glucose homeostasis and gut microbiota in adult mice. Here, we aimed to investigate the consequences of perinatal exposure to the same cocktail.

Pesticides were incorporated into a standard chow at doses exposing mice to the tolerable daily intake of each pesticide. C57Bl6J female mice were exposed during gestation and lactation. After weaning, pups were fed a standard chow diet for 4 months and then challenged or not with a high-fat diet for 2 months. Metabolic parameters were assessed throughout the experiment. After 6 months, host metabolism and gut microbiota metabolism were evaluated using 1H-NMR-based metabolomics.

Before the metabolic challenge, no differences were observed in metabolic parameters between exposed and non-exposed pups. However, urinary and fecal metabolomic profiles were distinct, and pesticide-induced perturbations were sex-specific. Trimethylamine, a host-gut microbiota cometabolite, was lower in the urine of exposed males but higher in the urine of exposed females. Fecal metabolic profiles were also significantly different in exposed versus non-exposed males. After the high-fat diet challenge, no differences were observed in urinary metabolic profiles, but fecal metabolic profiles were strongly altered in exposed versus non-exposed females. Our results suggest that perinatal exposure to pesticides could influence gut microbiota metabolism, with a significant diet-pesticide-sex interaction.

### P-327: Advancing the Chemical Characterization and Health Effects Associated with House Dust Exposure: Thirdhand Tobacco Smoke as a Case Study

**Presenting Author:** Noelia Ramirez, Institut d’Investigacio Sanitaria Pere Virgili-URV-CIBERDEM, Spain

**Co-Authors:** Sonia Torres, Carla Merino, Beatrix Paton, Sara Samino, Neema Adhami, Manuela Martins-Green, Emma L. Schymanski, Xavier Correig

House dust acts as a sink and repository for toxicants, which persist for long periods or react with atmospheric oxidants to form secondary toxicants. Given that people spend over 90% of their time indoors, a more accurate characterization of house dust's chemical composition could provide valuable information about the human exposome. A particular case of dust contamination is thirdhand tobacco smoke (THS), a poorly understood pathway of tobacco exposure produced by the deposition and aging of tobacco smoke particles and toxicants on surfaces and in dust. This aged tobacco smoke becomes increasingly toxic, re-emitted into the air, or reacts with other chemicals in the environment to yield new toxicants, including carcinogens.

Although there is increasing evidence of THS hazards, their accurate chemical characterization and the specific cellular and molecular consequences of THS exposure remain to be fully elucidated. We analyzed smoker and non-smoker house dust samples using metabolomics-style non-target identification to identify masses with significant differences between the sample groups. Annotation was performed using the in silico fragmenter MetFrag coupled to the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard and PubChem. We combined non-targeted metabolomics applied to two THS-exposed animal models (C57BL/6 mice exposed to THS under conditions mimicking human exposure in smokers' homes and zebrafish embryos exposed to tobacco-specific nitrosamines) and targeted analysis of neurotransmitters and specific biomarkers of tobacco exposure in children's urine exposed and non-exposed to THS. The results presented here provide key evidence of THS health hazards.

### P-329: Development of a Food Exposure and Urine Sampling Strategy for Dietary Exposure Biomarkers in Free-Living Individuals Using High-Resolution Metabolite Fingerprinting and Targeted Quantification

**Presenting Author:** Amanda Lloyd, Aberystwyth University, United Kingdom

**Co-Authors:** A.J. Lloyd, T. Wilson, N.D. Willis, L. Lyons, H. Phillips, L. Xie, E. Holmes, G. Frost, K. Tailliart, M. Beckmann, J.C. Mathers, J. Draper

Dietary choices modulate the risk of chronic diseases, and improving diet is a central component of public health strategies. Food-derived metabolites present in urine can provide objective biomarkers of dietary exposure when coupled with self-reported diet records. To assist in biomarker validation, we developed a food intervention strategy mimicking a typical diet with different food presentations, cooking methods, and processing within complex meals. We also assessed urine sampling protocols potentially suitable for future deployment of biomarker technology.

Six different menu plans representing a typical diet were split into two dietary experimental periods. Free-living adult participants (n=15 and n=36, respectively) were provided with all their food over three consecutive days. Multiple spot urine samples were collected and stored at home. Flow Infusion-High Resolution Fingerprinting using Orbitrap MS coupled with High Performance Computer-enabled multivariate classification and feature selection were used to explore the composition of spot urine samples collected throughout the day. Biomarkers were validated using Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography quantification, using chemical standards.

We successfully implemented a food exposure and urine sampling strategy for dietary exposure biomarker validation in free-living individuals. Biomarker performance was tested with different food formulations and processing methods involving meat, wholegrain, and fruits/vegetables. Additionally, novel biomarkers were identified for foods where biomarkers have yet to be discovered in relation to the UK government's healthy eating policies. Spot urine samples, together with robust dietary biomarkers that report multiple components of the UK diet, should allow routine dietary exposure monitoring in large epidemiological studies.

### P-330: Investigation of Compounds Responsible for the Flavor of Peruvian Chocolate from Fine Flavor Cocoa

**Presenting Author:** Stephanie Michel, ICOBA - PUCP, Peru

**Co-Authors:** Alfredo Ibañez Gabilondo, Madina Mansurova

Flavor is a critical characteristic of chocolate, influencing consumer willingness to pay. Currently, two types of cocoa beans have been characterized according to their flavor and aroma profiles: ordinary and fine flavor cocoa (FFC). In this project, we investigated how flavor precursors in Peruvian FFC chocolate are transformed during each stage of chocolate manufacturing. We identified eleven chemical compounds responsible for the fine flavor of Peruvian chocolate and analyzed their development during the main stages of chocolate manufacture using solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography (HS-SPME-GC-MS) and direct analysis in real time (DART-MS).

With this knowledge, we can understand the chemistry of Peruvian chocolate manufacturing and establish a standardized manufacturing quality control protocol. This will allow local producers to improve the quality of their production.

### P-331: High-Efficient and High-Throughput Volatile Flavor Analysis of Fermented Seasonings Using SA-SBSE

**Presenting Author:** YOKO IIJIMA, Kanagawa Institute of Technology, Japan

**Co-Authors:** Azusa Miwa, Hikaru Inagaki, Yusuke Ito, Kikuo Sasamoto, Takeharu Nakahara, Nobuo Ochiai

In food metabolomics, specific food samples are frequently analyzed to determine the relationship between the metabolome and sensory evaluation data, thereby establishing their flavor or nutritional properties and optimal processing conditions. In Japan, fermented seasonings such as soy sauce, miso paste, and mirin (sweet rice wine) are very popular and indispensable for traditional Japanese cuisine. These seasonings have complex flavor properties determined by several parameters, including their materials, microorganism strains, fermentation conditions, and maturation periods.

Headspace analysis using direct extraction or solid-phase microextraction is a well-known, high-throughput analytical method for volatile metabolomics. However, fermented seasonings contain several semipolar, odor-active volatiles that cannot be efficiently extracted from the headspace vapor phase, indicating that the volatile composition obtained from headspace extraction does not sufficiently reflect actual odor profiles. In this study, we developed a new high-efficiency and high-throughput volatile flavor analysis using SA-SBSE (solvent-assisted stir bar sorptive extraction) for fermented seasonings.

First, flavor volatiles were extracted from each sample using SAFE (solvent-assisted flavor evaporation), known as the most reliable flavor analysis extraction method. Odor-active volatiles were then screened using GC-Olfactometry. We confirmed that SA-SBSE could extract the volatiles with high efficiency, recovering >80% of the compounds detected using SAFE. Therefore, we suggest that SA-SBSE is suitable for flavor metabolomics of fermented seasonings due to its extraction reproducibility and quantitativity.

### P-332: Discovery of Intake Biomarkers for Different Heat-Processed Potato Products by Metabolomics

**Presenting Author:** Xiaomin Zhou, University of Copenhagen, Denmark

**Co-Authors:** Cătălina S. Cuparencu, Natalia Vazquez Manjarrez, Gözde Gürdeniz, Lars Ove Dragsted

**Background:** Potatoes are an important staple food in human nutrition, but their role in human health, beyond their contribution to energy and resistant starch, is still debated. Biomarkers of food intake (BFIs) can complement traditional dietary assessment tools. Therefore, we aimed to identify urinary exposure markers for potato products (cooked potato, chips, and French fries).

**Methods:** A randomized controlled single-blinded cross-over meal study was conducted. Four different intervention meals were prepared: boiled rice, boiled potato, chips, and French fries. Discriminating features in urine were selected using ANOVA and PLSDA, as well as kinetics of excretion.

**Results:** Thirty putative BFIs were found for heat-processed potato products, differentiating between cooking and deep-cooking methods. Two putative BFIs were identified for potatoes in general, and one for rice. Five of the 30 BFIs were identified or putatively annotated as conjugates of furaneol and 2,4-dihydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone and hippuric acid. The rest included a range of conjugated compounds from Maillard reactions, with proposed precursors being furans, pyrroles, or pyridines.

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that it is possible to find biomarkers for the intake of potato products in urine samples. Combinations of identified or putatively annotated markers are proposed as potentially specific for the intake of potatoes, differentiated by different cooking processes.

**Perspective:** Further studies are needed to identify unknown biomarkers and to assess the robustness, reliability, and repeatability in cross-sectional settings of the candidate heat-processed potato intake biomarkers identified in this study.

### P-333: Metabolic Profiling for Utilization of Soybean Residues After Protein Extraction with Different Temperatures

**Presenting Author:** Hyejin Hyeon, Incheon National University, South Korea

**Co-Authors:** Cheol Woo Min, Sun Tae Kim, Jaeho Cha, Keumok Moon, Jae Kwang Kim

Soybeans are well-known for their enriched nutritional compounds, including functional peptides, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and flavonoids. To use soybeans as a principal source of protein, novel aqueous processes for protein purification have been developed. However, these techniques must also consider the utilization of residues remaining after protein extraction.

The aim of this study is to reveal the availability of soybean residues extracted at three different temperatures: 4°C, 25°C, and 55°C. Metabolic profiling using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), GC-time of flight (TOF) MS, and GC-flame ionization detector (FID) was conducted to investigate the nutritional quality of soybean residues. Sixty-four metabolites, including lipophilic compounds (policosanols, tocopherols, and sterols), hydrophilic compounds (organic acids, amino acids, sugars, and amines), and fatty acids, were identified.

Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, such as partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and analysis of variance (ANOVA), showed that soybeans extracted at 55°C were notably distinguished from those extracted at 4°C and 25°C. The significantly contributing metabolites for the discriminations were 8 amino acids, 7 organic acids, 3 sugars, and 2 other compounds. This study indicates that essential and non-essential amino acids were accumulated by warm water extraction, and galactose was interestingly increased by the degradation of oligosaccharides known as anti-nutrients. Considering the nutritional effects of 55°C extracted soybean residues, they are expected to be used as feed for livestock to increase their market value.

### P-334: Metabolite Characterization for Fermented Rice Koji by Degree of Milling (DOM)

**Presenting Author:** Sunmin Lee, Konkuk University, South Korea

**Co-Authors:** Da Eun Lee, Digar Singh, Choong Hwan Lee

Koji, an essential component or starter for numerous fermented foods and beverages, is widely used in food fermentative bioprocesses. A time-correlated metabolomic profiling was performed for fermented rice koji made using substrates with varying degrees of milling (DOM).
