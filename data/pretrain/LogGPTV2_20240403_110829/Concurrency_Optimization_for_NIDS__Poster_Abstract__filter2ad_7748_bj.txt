In this study, ambient fine particles (diameter less than 25 μm; PM25) were collected at urban cities in China and Korea (ie, Beijing and Gwangju, 
respectively) during January 2018, and the dichloromethane (DCM) extracts of the PM25 samples were analyzed using an ultrahigh-resolution 
(UHR) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer to identify the molecular characteristics of organic aerosols collected 
during wintertime at both urban cities The FT-ICR MS analysis of the water-insoluble organic fractions (WIOCs) revealed that CHO and CHON 
class species were occupied more than 90% of the total WIOCs The haze events with high organonitrate proportions were observed at both sites, 
but the CHON proportions at Beijing site have no correlation with secondary ionic species and gaseous components, implying that the nitrogen-
containing organics originate from primary sources We also found that the proportion of CHON class species at Gwangju site positively correlates 
with the concentrations of gaseous nitric acid and ammonia, indicating that ambient nitrate and ammonia has a role in the atmospheric formation of 
nitrogen-containing organic compounds at the Gwangju site Particularly, significant proportions of CHN compounds were observed at Beijing site, 
while negligible amounts of CHN was detected at Gwangju site Following two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(GCGC-TOFMS) analysis identified the quinoline class compounds and the corresponding -CH2 homologous series from the WIOC at Beijing site 
Interpretation of molecular changes of urban organic aerosols using an ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometer and meteorological information 
could provide broad insight for understanding ambient organic aerosols

Equine multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency also known as atypical myopathy (AM), is a highly fatal muscle disease of grazing horses This 
syndrome is accompanied by muscular weakness, acute myonecrosis and myoglobinuria, which in at least 75% of cases leads to death within 72 h It 
is caused by ingestion of Acer Pseudoplatanus seeds containing hypoglycin A, whose active metabolite, the MCPA-CoA, is responsible for inhibition 
of FAD-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenases The aim of this work was to compare the serum metabolomic profile of horses suffering from AM and 
controls and to confirm AM diagnosis in blood of newborn foal Metabolomic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography with aminopropyl 
column coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (QTRAP 5500, AB Sciex) The metabolites were detected by multiple reaction monitoring in both 
positive and negative mode and statistically evaluated in R software Analysis of specific biomarker MCPA-carnitine was performed by liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using the UltiMate 3000 system with BEH C18 column (50 mm, 17 µm, 21 mm) coupled to a triple-
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Triple Quad 6500; SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) Significant differences were demonstrated in the concentrations 
of various glycine conjugates and acylcarnitines (C2–C26) Moreover, the concentrations of purine and pyrimidine metabolites, vitamins and 
selected organic and amino acids were altered in horses with AM Metabolomic analysis of the foal’s blood revealed increased concentrations of 
acylcarnitines and MCPA-carnitine consistent with metabolic profiles of blood from AM affected horses The work was supported by the Czech 
Science Foundation Grant [18-12204S] and NPU I (LO1304)

Optimization of comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LCxLC) for the lipidomic analysis of zebrafish
PRESENTING AUTHOR: mengmeng xu, VU University, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Pim Leonards
Background: Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) has become state of the art in lipid analysis Reverse-phase (RP) LC, 
normal-phase (NP) LC, and hydrophilic interaction (HILIC) phases are often used However, one-dimensional LC (1DLC) is not sufficient to cover the 
lipidome because of co-elution Two-dimensional LC (2DLC) improves the separation power before detection with MS Methods: The orthogonality 
of separation mechanisms is an important aspect in 2DLC (LC×LC) HILIC and RPLC were selected due to their solvent compatibility A RPLC C18 
column (21 mm × 100 mm, 26 µm) as the first dimension column, and a HILIC column (21 mm × 50 mm, 17 µm) as second dimension column were 
optimized for the separation of lipids The combination of HILCI×RPLC was tested as well A QTOF MS system was used for the detection of the 
lipids Zebrafish eggs and larvae were analysed Result: RPLC separated the lipids depending on the hydrophobic character and the lipids were 
separated based on the fatty acyl chain length and the number and positions of double bonds In contrast, the separation of lipids by HILIC was 
based on the differences in the polar head groups of the specific lipid classes The 2DLC analysis of zebrafish samples showed the separation of 
various classes of lipids (eg LPC, PC, PE, PI, PA, PS, DAG, TAG), and more than 1000 lipids were detected The separation was much improved 
compared to 1DLC Comprehensive 2DLC is a promising method for lipid characterizations of complex biological samples

Insights into the toxicity of propazine on freshwater microalgae Chlorella Vulgaris (CV) and Scenedesmus Obliquus (SO): 
Untargeted Metabolomics via LC-QTOF
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Hiranya Dayal, National University of Singapore, Singapore
CO-AUTHORS: Sam Li Fong Yau
This study aims to utilize untargeted metabolomics using LC-QTOF to elucidate the impact of propazine, on freshwater microalgae Freshwater 
microalgae are a group of phytoplanktons, popularly employed in biomonitoring and ecotoxicology studies The toxicity of propazine was studied 
at a range of 10 µg/l -10 mg/l over 5 days on two freshwater microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris (CV) and Scenedesmus obliquus (SO) The growth rate of 
CV showed a gradual dose-dependent decline, while that of SO was significantly inhibited from 5 mg/l of propazine Preliminary results reveal that 
in CV, the exposure resulted in a slow increase of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MDCG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DDCG) levels with time, that 
may be attributed to enhanced membrane lipid synthesis However, there was an observed decrease in MDCG and DDCG in SO from 100 µg/l that 
reached significance at 5 mg/l, which can be correlated with the observed growth inhibition at the same exposure level Fluorescence-based assay 
for reactive oxygen species (ROS) further showed a gradual decrease in cellular ROS for CV with propazine exposure indicating that while growth 
rate of CV was slow with propazine exposure, some protection from further oxidative stress was provided with reinforcement of their cell membrane 
Meanwhile, a significant increase in ROS was observed in SO from 5 mg/l propazine implying its limitations in tolerating environmental stress due to 
propazine The results demonstrate that different microalgae have differing tolerances to propazine exposure, and reveal metabolomics as a tool to 
complement biochemical assays in assessing the environmental impact of herbicides on microalgae

Framework for damage assessment of oryza sativa after chemical accident using metabolic effect level
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Woojung Kim, School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, 
South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Sangdon Kim
As the changes in metabolome reflect mode of action specific cellular responses after chemical exposure, post-accident damage assessment 
based on metabolomics approaches emerged as a better alternative compared with physiologic approaches The ministry of environment tried to 
characterize of plant damage by introducing metabolomics However, target metabolite selection process was unclear and the exposure method 
did not reflect the chemical accident scenario, so the results had not been put to practical use Thus, untargeted metabolomics and vapor exposure 
chamber were introduced in this study to overcome the limitations of existing research Toluene was selected by taking into account both accident 
frequency and hazards The oryza sativa was exposed in vapor exposure chamber The metabolic responses of plants were analyzed by LC-QToF-
MS based untargeted metabolic profiling and evaluated by multivariate statistical analysis and readable endpoints The exposed concentration-
based and recovery time-based metabolic response patterns were analyzed by principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant 
analysis In addition, the weight of shoot and root, the chlorophyll contents of leaves were assessed Overall, the results of multivariate statistical 
analysis demonstrated a number of potential biomarkers that were characterized by metabolomic approach and provided an insight into quantitative 
chemical accident damage assessment

Thirdhand smoke (THS) is a poorly understood pathway of tobacco exposure that is produced by the deposition and ageing of tobacco smoke particles 
and toxicants on surfaces, becoming progressively more toxic Recent studies revealed the harmful health effects of THS exposure, but its effects 
on the kidney have not been studied yet We applied untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics of the kidney and metabolomics of urine from mice 
exposed to THS under conditions that mimic the exposure in smokers’ homes, using a multiplatform approach (UHPLC-QTOF and GC-QTOF) Kidneys 
from THS-exposed mice had significantly lower levels of betaine, which is a well-known kidney osmoprotectant Additionally, different metabolites 
from pyrimidine metabolism and intermediates of alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism were also depleted in THS-exposed kidneys Besides, 
several metabolites of the kynurenine pathway related to chronic kidney disease were found upregulated in urine of THS-exposed mice Lipidomics 
analysis of kidneys showed that levels of different acylcarnitines, which together with carnitine are important in energy metabolism, and several lipids, 
such as glycerophosphocholines and sphingomyelins, were considerably lower in kidneys of THS exposed mice, leaving an impairment in energetic 
lipid metabolism Interestingly, not all the metabolites altered as a result of THS exposure returned to near-control levels after an antioxidant treatment, 
indicating that the harmful effect of THS cannot easily be reverted This study demonstrates for the first time that THS exposure is a latent risk to the 
development of kidney disease and, if confirmed in humans, would provide major evidence to enforce tobacco control policies

Epidemiological evidence suggests a link between pesticide exposure and development of metabolic diseases We have shown a sexual dimorphic 
impact of a chronic dietary exposure to a low-dose cocktail of 6 pesticides (boscalid, captan, chlorpyrifos, thiofanate, thiacloprid, and ziram) on 
glucose homeostasis and gut microbiota in adult mice Here, we aimed to investigate the consequences of a perinatal exposure to the same 
cocktail Pesticides were incorporated in a standard chow at doses exposing mice to the tolerable daily intake of each pesticide C57Bl6J female 
mice were exposed during gestation and lactation After weaning, pups were fed a standard chow diet for 4 months, and then challenged or not 
with a high-fat for 2 months We assessed metabolic parameters throughout the experiment After 6 months, we evaluated host metabolism as 
well as gut microbiota metabolism using 1H-NMR-based metabolomics Before the metabolic challenge, no difference was observed in metabolic 
parameters between exposed and non-exposed pups However, the urinary and fecal metabolomic profiles were distinct and pesticide-induced 
perturbations were sex-specific Trimethylamine, a host-gut microbiota cometabolite, was lower in urine of exposed, compared to unexposed males, 
while it was higher in urine of exposed females Fecal metabolic profiles were also significant different in exposed vs non-exposed males After 
HFD, no difference was observed anymore in urinary metabolic profiles However, fecal metabolic profiles were strongly altered in exposed vs 
non-exposed females Our results suggest that a perinatal exposure to pesticides could influence the gut microbiota metabolism with a significant 
diet-pesticide-sex interaction

House dust acts as a sink and a repository of toxicants, which persist during long periods of times or react with atmospheric oxidants to form 
secondary toxicants Given people expend over 90% of their time indoors, a more accurate characterization of house dust chemical composition 
might provide valuable information about human exposome A particular case of dust contamination is thirdhand tobacco smoke (THS), a novel and 
poorly understood pathway of tobacco exposure that is produced by the deposition and ageing of tobacco smoke particles and toxicants in surfaces 
and dust This aged tobacco smoke becomes increasingly toxic with age, re-emitted into the air or react with other chemicals in the environment 
to yield new toxicants, including carcinogens Although the increasing evidences of THS hazards, their accurate chemical characterization and the 
specific cellular and molecular consequences of THS exposure remain to be fully elucidated We have analyzed smoker’ and non-smokers’ house 
dust samples using metabolomics-style non-target identification to identify masses with significant difference between the sample groups, followed 
by annotation using the in silico fragmenter MetFrag coupled to the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard and PubChem Further, we have combined 
non-targeted metabolomics applied to two THS-exposed animal models (C57BL/6 mice exposed to THS under conditions that mimic exposure of 
humans in homes of smokers, and zebrafish embryos exposed to tobacco-specific nitrosamines), as well as, targeted analysis of neurotransmitters 
and specific biomarkers of tobacco exposure in children’s urine exposed and non-exposed to THS The results presented here provide key 
evidences about THS health hazards

Dietary choices modulate the risk of chronic diseases and improving diet is a central component of public health strategies Food-derived metabolites 
present in urine could provide objective biomarkers of dietary exposure when coupled with self-reported diet records To assist biomarker validation 
we developed a food intervention strategy mimicking a typical diet with different food presentations, cooking methods and processing within complex 
meals and assessed urine sampling protocols potentially suitable for future deployment of biomarker technology Six different menu plans representing 
comprehensively a typical diet that were split into two dietary experimental periods Free-living adult participants (n=15 and n=36, respectively) were 
provided with all their food over a period of 3 consecutive days Multiple spot urine samples were collected and stored at home Flow Infusion-High 
Resolution Fingerprinting using Orbitrap MS coupled with High Performance Computer-enabled multivariate classification and feature selection were 
used to explore the composition of spot urine samples collected throughout the day Biomarkers were validated using Ultra High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography quantification, using chemical standards We successfully implemented a food exposure and urine sampling strategy for dietary 
exposure biomarker validation in free-living individuals Biomarker performance was tested with different food formulations and processing methods 
involving meat, wholegrain and fruits/vegetables Additionally, novel biomarkers were identified for foods where biomarkers have yet to be discovered 
in relation to the UK government healthy eating policies Spot urine samples, together with robust dietary biomarkers that report multiple components 
of the UK diet should allow routine dietary exposure monitoring in large epidemiological studies

Investigation of compounds responsible for the flavor of Peruvian chocolate from fine flavor cocoa
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Stephanie Michel, ICOBA - PUCP, Peru
CO-AUTHORS: Alfredo Ibañez Gabilondo, Madina Mansurova
Flavor is one of the most important characteristics of chocolate, besides being a key aspect to determine the price that the consumer is willing to pay 
Currently, two types of cocoa beans have been characterized according to their profile of flavor and aroma, (1) the ordinary and (2) the fine flavor cocoa 
(FFC) In this project we have investigated how the flavor precursors presented in Peruvian FFC chocolate are transformed during each of the stages 
of chocolate manufacturing We have identified eleven chemical compounds responsible for the fine flavor of Peruvian chocolate, and have analyzed 
their development during the main stages of chocolate manufacture using solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography (HS-SPME-GC-
MS) and direct analysis in real time (DART-MS) With this knowledge we can understand the chemistry of the Peruvian chocolate manufacturing, and 
establish a standardized manufacturing quality control protocol, that allows to local producers to improve the quality of their production

High-efficient and High-throughput volatile flavor analysis of fermented seasonings using SA-SBSE
PRESENTING AUTHOR: YOKO IIJIMA, Kanagawa Institute of Technology, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Azusa Miwa, Hikaru Inagaki, Yusuke Ito, Kikuo Sasamoto, Takeharu Nakahara, Nobuo Ochiai
In food metabolomics, specific food samples are frequently analyzed to determine the relationship between metabolome and sensory evaluation data, 
thereby establishing their flavor or nutritional properties, and optimal processing conditions In Japan, fermented seasonings, such as soy sauce, miso 
paste and mirin (sweet rice wine), are very popular and have become particularly indispensable for the traditional Japanese cuisine These seasonings 
have complex flavor properties, which are determined using several parameters derived from their materials, microorganism strains, fermentation 
conditions and maturation periods Further, headspace analysis using direct extraction or solid-phase microextraction is a well-known, high-throughput, 
analytical method for volatile metabolomics However, fermented seasonings contain several semipolar, odor-active volatiles that cannot be efficiently 
extracted from the headspace vapor phase, indicating that the volatile composition obtained from headspace extraction does not sufficiently reflect actual 
odor profiles In the present study, we developed a new high-efficiency and high-throughput volatile flavor analysis using SA-SBSE (solvent-assisted stir 
bar sorptive extraction) for fermented seasonings First, flavor volatiles were extracted from each sample using SAFE (solvent-assisted flavor evaporation), 
which is known as the most reliable flavor analysis extraction method Odor-active volatiles were then screened using GC-Olfactometry Next, we 
confirmed that SA-SBSE could extract the volatiles with high-efficiency, recovering >80% of the compounds detected using SAFE Therefore, we suggest 
that SA-SBSE is suitable for flavor metabolomics of fermented seasonings owing to its extraction reproducibility and quantitativity

Discovery of Intake Biomarkers for Different Heat-Processed Potato Products by Metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Xiaomin Zhou, University of Copenhagen, Denmark
CO-AUTHORS: Cătălina S. Cuparencu, Natalia Vazquez Manjarrez, Gözde Gürdeniz, Lars Ove Dragsted
Background: Potato is an important staple food in human nutrition, however, except for its contribution to energy and effects related to resistant 
starch the role of potato in human health is still debated Biomarkers of food intake (BFIs) may be viewed as complementary tools for traditional 
dietary assessment tools Therefore, we aimed to identify urinary exposure markers of potato products (cooked potato, chips and French fries) 
Methods: A randomized controlled single-blinded cross-over meal study was conducted Four different intervention meals were prepared: boiled 
rice, boiled potato, chips and French fries Discriminating features in urine were selected by the use of ANOVA and PLSDA as well as kinetics of 
excretion Results: Thirty putative BFIs were found for heat-processed potato products which can differentiate between cooking and deep-cooking 
methods, two putative BFIs for potato in general and one for rice Five of the 30 BFIs were identified or putatively annotated as conjugates of 
furaneol and 2,4-dihydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone and hippuric acid Among the rest were a range of conjugated compounds from Maillard 
reactions, and the proposed precursors were furans, pyrroles or pyridines Conclusion: The study demonstrates that it is possible to find biomarkers 
for intake of potato products in urine samples Combinations of identified or putatively annotated markers are proposed as potentially specific for 
intake of potato differentiated by different cooking processes Perspective: Further studies are needed to identify the unknown biomarkers and to 
assess the robustness, reliability and repeatability in cross-sectional settings of the candidate heat-processed potato intake biomarkers identified in 
this study

Metabolic profiling for utilization of soybean residues after protein extraction with different temperatures
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Hyejin Hyeon, Incheon National University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Cheol Woo Min, Sun Tae Kim, Jaeho Cha, Keumok Moon, Jae Kwang Kim
Soybean is well known as one of the most important ingredients due to their enriched nutritional compounds such as functional peptides, 
carbohydrates, fatty acids and flavonoids In order to use soybeans as principal sources of protein, novel aqueous processes for protein 
purification have been developed However, these techniques have to be simultaneously concerned about the use of remained residues after 
protein extractions The aim of this study is to reveal availability of soybean residues extracted at three different temperatures; 4ºC, 25 ºC and 
55ºC Metabolic profiling with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), GC-time of flight (TOF) MS and GC-flame ionization detector 
(FID) was conducted to investigate nutritional quality analysis of soybean residues As a result, 64 metabolites including lipophilic compounds 
(policosanols, tocopherols and sterols), hydrophilic compounds (organic acids, amino acids, sugars and amine) and fatty acids were identified 
Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis such as partial least-squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that soybeans extracted at 55ºC were notably distinguished with 4ºC and 25ºC The significantly contributed 
metabolites for the discriminations were 8 amino acids, 7 organic acids, 3 sugars and 2 other compounds This study represented that lots of 
essential and nonessential amino acids were accumulated by warm water extraction and galactose was interestingly increased by degradation of 
oligosaccharides known as anti-nutrients Considering the nutritional effects of 55 ºC extracted soybean residues, they expected to be used as feed 
for livestock to increase their market value
