User: I wrote a python script for a friend to make a job task easier. Now her company wants to pay me for another script (woot!). However she works on a Mac and I have only a Windows pc and an Ubuntu pc. While python is multi-platform, I ran into a problem with the first script that was only happening on her Mac. So is there a (hopefully free) way to emulate OS X on a Windows PC or Ubuntu, so I can test my script on a mac before hand, without having to give it to her and say 'ok this might work'.
Assistant: As long as you stick to the common and POSIX/UNIX interfaces, it will work equally fine on both Ubuntu and OS X barring any deep magic. Since you haven't described the problem, that's the only advice that can be given.
