Abstract
We investigate how a population of end-users with es-
pecially salient security and privacy risks — sex workers —
conceptualizes and manages their digital safety. The commer-
cial sex industry is increasingly Internet-mediated. As such,
sex workers are facing new challenges in protecting their dig-
ital privacy and security and avoiding serious consequences
such as stalking, blackmail, and social exclusion. Through
interviews (n=29) and a survey (n=65) with sex workers in
European countries where sex work is legal and regulated,
we ﬁnd that sex workers have well-deﬁned safety goals and
clear awareness of the risks to their safety: clients, deﬁcient
legal protections, and hostile digital platforms. In response to
these risks, our participants developed complex strategies for
protecting their safety, but use few tools speciﬁcally designed
for security and privacy. Our results suggest that if even high-
risk users with clear risk conceptions view existing tools as
insufﬁciently effective to merit the cost of use, these tools are
not actually addressing their real security needs. Our ﬁndings
underscore the importance of more holistic design of security
tools to address both online and ofﬂine axes of safety.
1 Introduction
In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the num-
ber of sex workers working partly or exclusively through the
Internet [15]. Sex work is prohibited or heavily regulated
in most countries, resulting in many sex workers needing to
manage digital and physical risks carefully while carrying
out their work. Even in countries where sex work is legal, the
profession is heavily stigmatized [63], and working legally
may not be an option for all workers [59, 69]. Furthermore,
sex work can be a risky business: in person, sex workers
may face aggressive or violent clients, and police or immigra-
tion action [37, 59]; online, sex workers may face doxxing,
harassment, or having their content stolen or misused [38].
Much like other end-users — but unlike previously studied
at-risk occupations such as journalists [50] — sex workers
rarely receive specialized digital security and privacy training
or customized security tools.
Further, sex workers make up a sizable portion of the pop-
ulation: an estimated 42 million people are engaged in sex
work worldwide [43, 56], spanning all genders, ethnicities,
and socioeconomic backgrounds [35,54,64]. A growing body
of sociological and HCI research has looked at how the In-
ternet has impacted the working conditions of sex workers,
including how they ﬁnd and interact with clients [7, 11], con-
duct their businesses [63, 64], and even the forms of sex work
they do (for example, supplementing in-person sex work with
camming: live performance of sex acts on camera) [15,39,65].
Yet, while many recent studies on digitally-mediated sex work
touch upon safety management [63, 64], none, to our knowl-
edge, center the digital safety experiences and technical needs
of this high-risk population.
Our research goal is to elucidate how sex workers manage
their digital privacy and security. By understanding how a
population that knowingly operates in risky physical, legal,
and social contexts makes decisions around digital privacy
and security, where the consequences of unwanted exposure
can be signiﬁcant, we hope to better understand (1) how tech-
nology can better address the speciﬁc safety needs of this
particular population, (2) how awareness of serious risk inﬂu-
ences digital security and privacy behavior, and (3) whether
existing safety strategies and tools leave some needs unmet
or force unwanted trade-offs. A better understanding of how
this population manages digital safety can also inform our
approach to improving digital security for end-users more
broadly.
Through 29 semi-structured interviews with sex workers
in Germany and Switzerland and a survey of 65 sex workers
in Germany, Switzerland, and the UK (all countries in which
sex work is legal but regulated), we explore sex workers’ self-
deﬁned safety goals, the risks they identify to those goals
in terms of both adversaries they frequently defend against
as well as the digital tools that make protecting themselves
difﬁcult, and the concrete strategies and tools they use to
protect themselves against those risks.

Safety for our participants encompasses multiple axes, in-
cluding physical safety, ﬁnancial security, having and enforc-
ing clear boundaries, respect, privacy, legality, and access to
a community of sex workers. Each of these axes of safety is
dependent on others; a threat to one axis may increase the
risks from another. For example, a sex worker failing to keep
their legal name private may increase chances of physical
threats like stalking or blackmail.
Our participants describe complex safety strategies, such as
the use of multiple devices, self-censorship online, and the cre-
ation of support communities, e.g., to warn each other about
dangerous clients. Yet, despite being aware of risks, and de-
spite the serious consequences of failing to protect themselves,
few participants engage with traditional tools speciﬁcally de-
signed for privacy and security such as privacy settings, Tor,
encrypted chat platforms, and password managers. Sex work-
ers view these tools as lacking sufﬁcient efﬁcacy to address
their risks or merit the effort of use. Instead, our work sug-
gests the need for a more comprehensive re-imagining of
what it means to be safe online, beyond individual tools and
settings, including scaling the home-grown protections that
high-risk users such as sex workers develop for themselves
out of necessity, such as multiple identities, and protections
that address both online and ofﬂine axes.
2 Related Work
Digitally-mediated sex work. Sex work is deﬁned as the
exchange of sexual services for money, encompassing a broad
range of services such as escorting (i.e., full-service sex work),
erotic massage, porn acting, camming (performing live sex
acts on video), phone sex, professional domination (perform-
ing the dominant role in a BDSM relationship), and erotic
dancing. Sex work is increasingly digitally-mediated, offering
both new opportunities and challenges [37].
Prior work has examined the impact of the Internet on sex
work through an economic lens. In 2011, Cunningham and
Kendall found that the rise in digital sex work was due to over-
all increases in the commercial sex market and not from the
migration of street-based sex workers to digital spaces [15].
Sanders et al. also found that, in 2016, 35% of escorts based
in the U.K. were doing some form of digital sex work in addi-
tion to outdoor sex work [63]. Workers engaging in digitally-
mediated sex work also had higher earnings than outdoor
(street) workers [15]. Prior work suggests these economic
gains are related to the Internet’s utility as a tool for adver-
tising to clients, allowing sex workers a greater amount of
control over their ads and the clients they accept [7, 11, 64].
The Internet has also enabled new forms of sex work that
are entirely digital, like camming [39]. Furthermore, the in-
creased prevalence of the Internet has created new spaces for
digital activism and community among sex workers [22].
The Internet can also reduce sex workers’ risks. Strohmayer
et al. describe the ways that sex-worker support services use
digital technologies to better provide services [68], and in
subsequent work examined in particular the Bad Client and
Aggressor List used by sex workers in Canada to share warn-
ings about potentially dangerous clients with one another [67].
Additional work shows that digital mediation of sex work re-
duces rates of law enforcement interactions, in turn lowering
the risk of harassment or arrest [11, 15].
Nonetheless, sex workers still experience risks online and
ofﬂine, and the Internet is increasingly intertwined with their
safety management strategies. Several studies have discussed
how sex workers manage risk via the Internet. Moorman and
Harrison examine Backpage ads to learn how sex workers in
the U.S. manage risk through carefully crafted ad language,
and ﬁnd that risk management differs across race and gender,
with Black women and transgender sex workers exhibiting
the most risk management [54]. Sanders et al. ﬁnd in their
survey of U.K.-based sex workers that most (80%) had been
recent victims of crime, and enumerate ways they manage risk
through strategies like using pseudonyms on digital platforms,
screening for bad clients in forums, and relying on social
media to have safety check-ins with friends or partners [64].
In this work, we build on existing knowledge of sex work risk
management to hone in on the relationship between safety
goals and risk management strategies, focusing on where
digital safety strategies succeed and fail.
Digital privacy & security. There is an extensive body of
research on tools and strategies for digital privacy and security.
Multiple studies have examined the usability of various secu-
rity tools and privacy enhancing technologies like encrypted
chat (e.g., [1, 2]), Tor (e.g., [25, 72]), passwords and pass-
word managers (e.g., [9, 34]), and two-factor authentication
(e.g., [14, 21]). General themes from these studies suggest
that managing complex systems (as privacy and security tools
often are) is difﬁcult for many users, and the trade-offs users
make based on perceived costs and perceived risks may lead
to low adoption of even well-designed tools [8,31,62]. In this
work, we examine whether users who perceive their digital
risks more concretely, and who have arguably more severe
risks, utilize more or different tools and protective behaviors.
Other work has focused speciﬁcally on how marginalized
or otherwise high-risk populations manage privacy and secu-
rity. Lerner et al. found that among transgender people, the
Internet provided signiﬁcant beneﬁts in terms of activism and
promoting representation of trans people, while creating new
risks like blackmail and doxxing [42]. Guberek et al. studied
privacy and security behaviors of undocumented immigrants,
ﬁnding that participants took few concrete steps to protect
their digital privacy and security [27], while Simko et al. ex-
amined U.S. refugees’ digital privacy and security, ﬁnding
that cultural differences impacted knowledge of digital risks,
as well as the usability of security mechanisms like account
recovery questions [66]. In prior work examining a high-risk
occupation that depends on the Internet, McGregor et al. stud-

ied journalists’ digital protective strategies and found that
participants stopped using or were unable to use some secure
tools because they were disruptive to or incompatible with
their journalistic workﬂow, and that using secure tools with
sources was challenging because both parties needed to use
the tool for it to be effective [50]. Building on this prior work,
we examine a high-risk population whose members frequently
have multiple, intersecting high-risk identities, including gen-
der identity [35] and immigration status [69]. Like journalists,
sex workers often use the Internet for work, but without the
specialized training or tools journalists often have.
Additional prior work has examined how technology is
used in relationships with intimate partner violence (IPV) to
create harm [24, 30, 46], while yet other work has examined
end-users’ security and privacy considerations during online
dating [13, 26]. Our work focuses on digital security and
privacy within commercial, regulated sexual contexts rather
than non-commercial relationship contexts, though some risks
may overlap.
3 Methods
We seek to understand (1) sex workers’ safety goals; (2) the
privacy and security challenges sex workers face in achieving
those goals; and (3) the strategies workers use to mitigate
those risks and achieve their safety goals. To answer our
research questions, we conducted, in late 2018 and early 2019,
interviews (n=29) and surveys (n=65) with sex workers in
European countries in which sex work is legal.
Ethical considerations. As our participants are members
of a high-risk population, we not only consulted with an ethics
review board but also hired a sex worker to review our study
materials for ethics and appropriateness. Further, we took care
to protect participant privacy and ensure, as much as possible,
that our work does not risk identifying participants. Specif-
ically, we (1) collect no personally identiﬁable information,
including collecting no demographic data, and (2) use end-to-
end encrypted tools in all study communications. As we did
not collect participants’ demographics, we use gender-neutral
pronouns for all participants throughout the paper.
3.1 Participant Recruitment
Our recruitment strategy was designed to capture a broad
range of sex workers and their experiences, within legal, reg-
ulated contexts. We recruited interview participants by dis-
tributing recruitment ﬂyers, both in English and German, at
brothels in multiple cities, at multiple points of time, in Ger-
many and Switzerland. We further contacted brothels and
sex work organizations via email and phone calls. Organiza-
tions that were willing distributed our advertising materials to
their constituents. Lastly, participants were recruited through
snowball sampling, where participants recommended other
sex workers. Participants were incentivized with an additional
10 Euro/CHF for referrals. Hard-to-reach populations like sex
workers are often studied via such participant-driven sam-
pling [4, 36, 51]. However, such sampling methods can limit
generalizability. We used our multi-method recruitment ap-
proach to maximize generalizability — fewer than 10% of our
participants came from snowball sampling.
Participants signed up for the study via an online form.
They were given the option of creating an anonymous Pro-
tonMail account for scheduling and for compensation, or pro-
viding an email address of their choosing. Overall, the re-
cruitment process for this study took over four months; our
experience collecting data is described in more detail in [60].
Participant descriptives. While we did not collect demo-
graphic information to ensure the anonymity and establish
trust with our participants, many participants mentioned as-
pects of their identity during conversation. We can therefore
describe at a high level the plurality of identities that our par-
ticipants held, which shows that our sample, much like the
sex worker population in Eupope [69], is diverse across many
identities. Our sample contained sex workers who identify as
both men and women, and not all of our participants identify
as cisgender. Our sample contained participants that are im-
migrants from Eastern Europe, North America, and Africa,
and participants who had varying levels of work authorization.
Not all participants were white. Finally, the sex workers we
spoke to varied in age and work experience; some had just
begun working in the last year, while others had been working
for multiple decades.
Interview Data Collection
3.2
Interview protocol.
In our interviews, we sought to un-
derstand the safety goals, risks, and protective behaviors of
our participants. Participants were ﬁrst asked background
questions to understand the type of sex work the participant
performed and how they typically used the Internet in their
work and personal life. Next, we probed their experiences of
