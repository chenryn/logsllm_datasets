**Abstract:**
This study investigates how a population with significant security and privacy risks—sex workers—conceptualizes and manages their digital safety. As the commercial sex industry becomes increasingly internet-mediated, sex workers face new challenges in protecting their digital privacy and security, including avoiding serious consequences such as stalking, blackmail, and social exclusion. Through 29 semi-structured interviews and a survey of 65 sex workers in European countries where sex work is legal and regulated, we find that sex workers have well-defined safety goals and a clear awareness of the risks they face, including clients, inadequate legal protections, and hostile digital platforms. In response to these risks, participants developed complex strategies for protecting their safety but rarely used tools specifically designed for security and privacy. Our findings suggest that even high-risk users with a clear understanding of their risks view existing tools as insufficiently effective to justify their use. This underscores the need for more holistic design of security tools that address both online and offline dimensions of safety.

**1. Introduction**
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of sex workers operating partly or exclusively through the Internet. While sex work is prohibited or heavily regulated in many countries, it remains a risky profession, even in places where it is legal. Sex workers face numerous physical and digital threats, including aggressive clients, police action, doxxing, harassment, and content theft. Unlike other at-risk occupations, such as journalists, sex workers rarely receive specialized digital security and privacy training or customized security tools.

Sex workers make up a sizable and diverse population, estimated at 42 million worldwide, spanning all genders, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The Internet has transformed the working conditions of sex workers, enabling new forms of work and providing new opportunities and challenges. However, while many studies have examined the impact of digital mediation on sex work, few have centered on the digital safety experiences and technical needs of this high-risk group.

Our research aims to understand how sex workers manage their digital privacy and security. By examining the decision-making processes of a population that operates in risky physical, legal, and social contexts, we seek to:
1. Identify how technology can better address the specific safety needs of sex workers.
2. Understand how awareness of serious risks influences digital security and privacy behavior.
3. Determine whether existing safety strategies and tools leave some needs unmet or force unwanted trade-offs.

Through 29 semi-structured interviews and a survey of 65 sex workers in Germany, Switzerland, and the UK (where sex work is legal but regulated), we explore sex workers' self-defined safety goals, the risks they identify, and the strategies and tools they use to protect themselves.

**2.1 Digitally-Mediated Sex Work**
Sex work, defined as the exchange of sexual services for money, includes a wide range of activities such as escorting, erotic massage, porn acting, camming, phone sex, professional domination, and erotic dancing. The rise of digital mediation has created new opportunities and challenges for sex workers. Prior research has shown that the Internet has increased earnings for sex workers by providing a platform for advertising and client management. It has also enabled new forms of entirely digital sex work, such as camming, and has facilitated community and activism among sex workers.

While the Internet has reduced some risks, such as law enforcement interactions, it has also introduced new ones, such as online harassment and content theft. Studies have examined how sex workers manage these risks through various strategies, including the use of pseudonyms, client screening, and support networks.

**2.2 Digital Privacy & Security**
There is extensive research on tools and strategies for digital privacy and security, including the usability of encrypted chat, Tor, password managers, and two-factor authentication. General themes from these studies suggest that managing complex systems is difficult for many users, leading to low adoption rates even for well-designed tools. We examine whether users who perceive their digital risks more concretely, and who face more severe risks, utilize different tools and protective behaviors.

Other research has focused on marginalized or high-risk populations, such as transgender individuals, undocumented immigrants, and refugees, finding that these groups often face unique challenges in managing their digital privacy and security. Studies on journalists, another high-risk occupation, have shown that secure tools can be disruptive to their workflow and require both parties to use them effectively. Building on this prior work, we focus on sex workers, who often have multiple, intersecting high-risk identities and use the Internet for work without specialized training or tools.

**3. Methods**
**3.1 Ethical Considerations**
Given the high-risk nature of our participant population, we consulted with an ethics review board and hired a sex worker to review our study materials for ethical appropriateness. We took steps to protect participant privacy, including collecting no personally identifiable information and using end-to-end encrypted communication tools.

**3.2 Participant Recruitment**
We recruited participants through a multi-method approach, including distributing recruitment flyers at brothels in Germany and Switzerland, contacting sex work organizations, and using snowball sampling. Participants were incentivized with additional compensation for referrals. Our recruitment process took over four months, and we aimed to maximize generalizability by limiting the reliance on snowball sampling.

**3.3 Interview Data Collection**
Our interviews aimed to understand the safety goals, risks, and protective behaviors of sex workers. We asked background questions about the type of sex work participants performed and their use of the Internet in both work and personal life. We then probed their experiences with digital safety, including the strategies and tools they used to manage risks.

**Conclusion**
Our findings highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of digital safety for sex workers. While they have well-defined safety goals and a clear understanding of the risks they face, they often rely on home-grown strategies rather than traditional security tools. This suggests a need for more comprehensive and user-centered approaches to digital security that address both online and offline dimensions of safety.
