and a half man-months performing an extensive manual anal-
ysis of the data. The goals of this manual analysis were
twofold: i) to improve the automatic visual clustering results,
and ii) to categorize the clusters into the categories of Table I.
In order to assign the appropriate category to each page,
clusters of visually similar pages were, in many cases, split
up into smaller clusters. For instance, the cluster of pages
looking like amazon.com was split up into sub-clusters for
authoritative pages, afﬁliate abuse pages and ad parking pages.
To facilitate the manual analysis, we developed a custom web
application that presents all of the collected data, i.e., the
screenshots, WHOIS records, IP addresses and ﬁnal URLs
of the visited web pages, in a structured way. Ultimately,
40% of all clusters were classiﬁed, representing 95% of all
collected pages. Because of this second-phase manual analysis,
we have high conﬁdence in the quality and accuracy of our
data. Our dataset has been made available for download at

D. Types of Abuse
In this section we brieﬂy describe the non-self-explanatory
categories listed in Table I.
1) Afﬁliate abuse: We consider a page to be performing
afﬁliate abuse when it redirects its visitors to a legitimate
website, taking advantage of an afﬁliate program offered by
that legitimate site. Afﬁliate programs are arrangements in
3https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/imagehash
4http://ixazon.dynip.com/∼cmeclax/nilsimsa.html
which a website owner (the advertiser) pays a commission to a
third party (the afﬁliate) for sending trafﬁc to her website. For
instance, amazon.com pays a commission for every purchase
made by visitors coming from websites participating in their
afﬁliate program. To identify what trafﬁc comes from which
afﬁliate, each afﬁliate is assigned a unique identiﬁer that she
should specify in the URLs toward which she forwards her
visitors. Sometimes an intermediate company sits in between
the advertiser and the afﬁliate to handle the technical issues
of organizing an afﬁliate program and to make it easier for
advertisers and afﬁliates to ﬁnd each other. Most afﬁliate
programs have strict conditions that limit the ways in which
afﬁliates are allowed to bring trafﬁc to the advertiser’s website.
Banners and hyperlinks to the advertiser’s site are allowed, but
automatic forwarding typically is not. For instance, Amazon
explicitly disallows automatic forwarding.
An example of afﬁliate abuse by typosquatting that
is
active at the time of this writing, is the following: users who
mistype match.com as ma5ch.com (“t” substituted by the
QWERTY-adjacent “5”) are eventually brought back to the
match.com domain, but the typosquatting page appends an
afﬁliate identiﬁer to the URL when it redirects the user’s
browser from the typosquatting domain to the authoritative
one. As such, the owners of the authoritative domain will now
have to pay an afﬁliate commission to the typosquatter, for a
visit that should have been theirs in the ﬁrst place.
Identifying afﬁliate abuse is not always easy. In particular,
a naive analysis cannot differentiate afﬁliate abuse from so-
called defensive registrations, which are typosquatting domains
proactively registered by an authoritative domain owner, to
prevent abuse from typosquatters. Both types of domains
forward their visitors to the authoritative domain, typically
adding an identifying parameter to the forwarding URL. In
the case of afﬁliate abuse, this parameter is used to identify
the afﬁliate, while in the case of defensive registrations it is
typically used to identify the forwarding domain (for trafﬁc
analysis purposes). Because of this similarity, we did not
attempt to automatically identify afﬁliate abuse, relying on our
second-phase manual analysis for this instead. For this manual
analysis, we took into account several factors to identify
afﬁliate abuse, including (1) the names of parameters added
to the forwarding URL, (2) the values of these parameters,
(3) whether the authoritative site advertises the fact that it
has an afﬁliate program, and (4) the WHOIS records of the
authoritative and typosquatting domains. We did not attempt
to distinguish between typosquatting pages abusing an afﬁliate
program of their own authoritative domain or an afﬁliate
program of other unrelated domains, e.g., a typosquatting
domain of target.com redirecting the user to the afﬁliate
program of amazon.com.
2) Scam: A scam page is a page that tries to trick users
into performing an action that
is undesirable for the user
and proﬁtable for the attacker. Two popular types of scams
are “surveys” and malicious advertisements (malvertising). In
surveys, users are asked to perform a series of steps in return
for some reward, for example a $100 coupon for a big box
store. The steps almost always involve users entering their
email address, name, phone number and potentially physical
address. These details can then be used to subscribe users to

authoritative domain. Many registrars provide a service to
automatically register a wide range of possible cybersquatting
domain names when a trademark owner wants to register
a domain. Nevertheless, our data shows that only 156 of
the authoritative domains in our list have defensive domain
registrations, meaning that 344 domains (representing 68.8%
of the 500 most popular sites of the Internet) have no defensive
registrations whatsoever. Thus, anyone who makes a typo for
these domains and does not receive an error, is sure to land
on a malicious typosquatting page.
The top 3 of authoritative domains with the most defen-
sive registrations consists of huffingtonpost.com with
57 defensive domains, americanexpress.com with 42
domains and bloomberg.com with 39 domains. The top 3
of authoritative domains with the most malicious typosquat-
ting domains are adultfriendfinder.com with 132
typosquatting domains, constantcontact.com with 103
typosquatting domains and odnoklassniki.ru with 97
such domains. Alarmingly, out of the three banks in our
top 500 list (bankofamerica.com, hdfcbank.com and
icicibank.com), only bankofamerica.com has defen-
sive registrations. This means that if a user enters a typo
for the domain of one of the two other banks, she could
easily land on a phishing page,
thinking she entered the
proper domain name of her bank. Although we did not
encounter any phishing pages for these banks during our
study, our data shows hdfcbank.com had 42 active mali-
cious typosquatting domains, icicibank.com had 43, and
bankofamerica.com had 46. Any of these domains could
start hosting phishing pages at any time or redirect users to
the websites of competing ﬁnancial institutes.
It is surprising to see that, in a time where companies
are estimated to spend 7% of their information technology
budgets on security, and global cyber crime costs are estimated
between $300 billion and $1 trillion [15], many companies do
not bother to make any defensive registrations at all for their
domains. In particular, one would expect the ﬁnancial sector
to take a leading role in protecting their reputation and their
customers. It seems these companies are either not aware of
the problem, or simply do not care about it. The fact that large
Internet companies such as Microsoft [21] and Facebook [22]
are successfully contending with cybersquatters through defen-

spam lists, expensive mobile services, and even potentially sold
to larger data aggregators.
In malvertising, the scam page is trying to convince the
user to willingly download and execute a malicious program.
Fig. 1 shows the ad we got when purposefully mistyping
youtube.com as outube.com. If the user downloads and
installs the purported software update, she will be infected with
malware (11/51 virus engines at virustotal.com identiﬁed the
downloaded executable as malicious).
III. RESULTS
A. Malicious vs. Defensive Registrations
Our data indicates that typosquatting is still very prevalent
for the list of authoritative domains we considered. Out of these
500 domains, 477 have at least one malicious typosquatting
domain. We considered a domain to be malicious when it
is classiﬁed as such for at
least 7 days during the data
gathering period. These numbers indicates that on the attack
side, typosquatters have no trouble registering and exploiting
typosquatting domains, despite long-standing anticybersquat-
ting legislation [1].
On the defense side, trademark owners can protect them-
selves against typosquatting by proactively making defensive
typosquatting domain registrations whenever they register an
4
blank or black pages and pages that label themselves as under
construction. By manual analysis, we discovered that some of
the domains showing blank and black pages did show content
when visited through a foreign proxy server, indicating that
some typosquatters were using IP blacklists or geolocation
information to block our crawlers.
The afﬁliate abuse category is ranked third. During our
manual analysis, we discovered that many of the pages in this
category are using third-party services to hide the referring
URL when abusing an afﬁliate program. For instance the ty-
posquatting domain hostgatkr.com forwards its visitors to
tracking.warmmedia.com (with a parameter indicating
where to redirect to further on), which then redirects the visitor
to a URL within the hostgator.com domain, specifying an
afﬁliate id parameter. Because of the intermediate redirection,
the exploited site hostgator.com sees visitors coming
from warmmedia.com instead of hostgatkr.com. This
makes it much harder for HostGator to discover that they
are paying a commission for trafﬁc that should have been
theirs in the ﬁrst place. Other commonly used redirection
services we discovered are trafficinterface.com and
world-redirect.com.
Hit stealing is ranked ﬁfth in Table II but is the third
largest malicious category. We discovered two distinct types
of domains in this category. The ﬁrst type consists of do-
mains owned by a competitor of the authoritative site that
is being typosquatted. These domains typically just forward
their visitors to the competitor’s site, effectively stealing
the trafﬁc of the authoritative domain. While we saw this
behavior mostly with adult sites, some non-adult sites are
stealing hits from their competitors as well. For instance, the
Russian search site tochki.ru has typosquatting sites reg-
istered for google.com.ua, google.ru, rambler.ru
and yandex.ru. The other type of hit stealing domains are
those owned by Internet marketing companies trying to draw
trafﬁc to the sites of their customers. These domains typi-
cally forward their visitors to unrelated pages, often changing
the destination domain at regular time intervals or even on
every visit. For instance, over a dozen Czech typosquatting
domains of google.cz and seznam.cz were forwarding
their visitors to a different legitimate Czech domain on every
visit. Similarities in the way the forwarding is implemented on
these different typosquatting domains and in the parameters
speciﬁed in the destination URL, lead us to believe that all
of these domains are owned by a single Internet marketing
company that is using them to draw trafﬁc to its customers.
This is of course a questionable way of increasing the trafﬁc
to their customers’ websites, since the typosquatting domains
used for this purpose are typically unrelated to the various
landing pages, making it unlikely that a redirected visitor will
stay on the landing domain. As such, while the landing page
will likely receive hundreds or thousands of extra visitors, it
is doubtful that these visitors will be of value. One could
argue that these companies are providing “typosquatting-as-
a-service” rather than proper Internet marketing services.
