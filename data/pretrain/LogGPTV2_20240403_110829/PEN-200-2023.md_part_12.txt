Listing 22 - Our fix worked!
o
Excellent! We were able to restore our permission to execute our script and run it. It’s certainly a
relief to receive our list of employees again.
n
Let’s go one step further and restore our system so that we don’t run into this problem again.
Let’s try and run the chmodfix command on the original chmod file to fix things.
i
kali@kali:~$ ./chmodfix +x /usr/bin/chmod
z
./chmodfix: changing permissions of '/usr/bin/chmod': Operation not permitted
Listing 23 - Another obstacle.
D
We’ve hit another obstacle. We don’t have permission to modify /usr/bin/chmod.
Whoever set up this system made it so the average user could not interrupt system files in
/usr/bin/ (like chmod). Copying the file or the contents of the file was clearly allowed, but we’re
trying to write to a file in that folder, and we don’t have permission to do that.
Right now we are trying to run this command as the kali user. Let’s try running the command
again, but this time as a Super User. To do this, we’ll use the sudo command,162 followed by our
original command. The system will prompt us for our password.
kali@kali:~$ sudo ./chmodfix +x /usr/bin/chmod
[sudo] password for kali:
Listing 24 - Yo dawg, I heard you like chmod, so I chmod +x your chmod.
This worked.
It may be too early to call ourselves “hackers”. However, finding unique ways to gain permissions
unintended by a particular system is at the core of cyber security. This quick example offers a
solid start.

4.4.4 Analyzing this Approach
If much of the preceding example was new to you, congratulations! You’ve survived your first bit
of cyber security training. Remember, the actual solutions and commands aren’t as important as
understanding (for now) how this material was taught.
Although we covered an admittedly simple section from our written training, let’s take a moment
to examine how we taught this material. We’ll highlight a few things in particular:
1. Using the demonstration method
2. Learning by doing
3. The skill, not the tool
4. Interleaving
y
5. Expecting the unexpected
k
Let’s quickly explore each of these.
The demonstration method is used specifically in the tone and voice of the example covered, but
s
also in the series of actions that we follow. We don’t skip steps, including verifying whether our
solutions worked.
o
Notably, we encounter a “problem” (not being able to execute our script) almost immediately,
which represents the real-world, day-to-day experience of students after the course has ended.
n
Research also supports problem solving as a very effective learning strategy both for
engagement and retention.163
i
This problem-solving approach is used throughout Modules very intentionally. One way learners
z
can take advantage of this is by trying to predict outcomes. We might, for example, try to guess
what the next step will be in solving a problem. If we are surprised that the course material goes
D
in another direction, and if we’re curious, we can always try our solution!
This is a great way to follow the material, but let’s consider something little more direct and
practical. Learning by doing is an area where students can take learning into their own hands and
accelerate their own growth. The best way to do this is to follow along.
We can acknowledge that in the case presented in this Module, it would have been difficult to
follow along manually. Normally, a Module will include at least one virtual machine that is
specifically set up to allow learners to follow the accompanying text. In this case, we would have
used a Linux machine with our find_employee_names.py script on it.
Let’s discuss where and how to follow along by focusing on the code presented in the Module. A
keen student may have noticed that all of the code chunks use a similar style of formatting. Let’s
review one quickly:
kali@kali:~$ ls -l chmodfix
-rwxr-xr-x 1 kali kali 64448 Jun 8 08:21 chmodfix
Listing 25 - A sample code listing.

The “kali@kali:~$” is what will appear on the screen for a user who is following along. Everything
that appears in blue text (in this case, “ls -l chmodfix”) is a command that we can type into the
terminal. The text that follows is the output.
It’s also important to understand where the focus is, which brings us to the skill, not the tool.
If you are already familiar with chmod, you may have noticed that we chose one of many different
methods to use this tool. We chose, for example, not to explore how the permissions for our
script (before we were able to execute) could have been represented with the numerical
expression 644, which we could have fixed by running chmod 755.
Of course, it’s almost impossible to remember every specific command and syntax, and piling on
too much information increases cognitive load, making it more difficult to remember the material
later. Even the most experienced security researchers find themselves looking things up now and
then, and so we encourage learners to focus on why a command is being run versus what
y
command is being run.
Sometimes when new ideas are introduced or when there is akn opportunity to learn more outside
the text, we might introduce a footnote. Getting used to “leaving” the immediate problem in order
to go do a bit of research is also a critical skill. There shave been a number of footnotes in this
module already, and they appear in numbered superscript in the text.
Interleaving is inevitable with this type of hands-ono training. As a quick reminder, in the context of
education, interleaving is mixing of multiple subjects. In this case, we reviewed the touch, cat, and
ls commands, even though they weren’t directly related to the things we were trying to study.
n
They were, of course, related to our ability to modify chmod and our employee name script.
Another way of thinking about thisi is that the OffSec training materials are organized around
concepts, not commands. z
Finally, teaching learners how to expect the unexpected is not always easy to deliver. However, we
often accomplish this by tDaking an indirect route to our goal with the intention of realistically
highlighting issues you may experience in the field. Again, we hope to convey the logic behind our
decisions instead of simply presenting commands and syntax.
In this example, we mentioned a potential pitfall with directory permissions (in a sidebar). We also
knew that ./chmodfix +x /usr/bin/chmod wouldn’t work, but we included it and ran it. We’ll often
walk through “unexpected” scenarios when we present new Modules and we’ll include
unexpected outcomes in many of our challenges.
As students, it’s imperative that we grow comfortable being in situations we don’t fully
understand and try things that might not work. The only way to really be prepared for the
“unexpected” is to become comfortable in situations where we don’t know exactly how things will
pan out.
Not only this, but we cannot afford to avoid situations where we might feel stuck. In cyber
security, it’s extremely rare that the first approach we try works. In order to accurately represent
this field, OffSec’s approach is to teach the material in such a way that students can become
more resilient and agile, working through a particular problem until we are “unstuck”.
There is often more than one way to accomplish any goal, and we encourage you to attempt
other paths to reaching the goals we present. A curious learner might ask if, in the example
presented, we could solve the issue by simply running sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/chmod. This is

exactly the sort of thinking that we encourage, and why many of the challenges are presented in a
virtual environment where learners can experiment and try things. Trying out an approach that
doesn’t work is also a valuable learning experience.
This experiment-and-experiment-again mindset is at the heart of what we believe it takes to be
highly successful in this field, and at the risk of being redundant, the goal of our training is always
to teach the methodology and the mindset.
4.5 Tactics and Common Methods
Next, we need to think about strategy and tactics. Consider the following quote from Sun Tzu:
Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy
is the noise before defeat. – Sun Tzu
y
In the most basic sense, we can think of strategy as being a long-term vision, while tactics are the
short-term, immediate actions that we take. Strategy is the map, and tactics are the steps.
k
For learners in a formal school structure, the strategy and tactics of study are often built into the
school structure itself. A student’s schedule and the topsics of study, and even how that student
will approach the learning material, are all dictated by the school district or the instructor.
o
In the absence of that rigid school structure, a common mistake of adult learners is to approach
their studies casually, without thinking about either tactics or strategy. We might know, for
example, that it’s important to “take notesn”, but what exactly should we be writing down? And
what should we do with those notes?
This Learning Unit will present a sieries of specific tactics for learners to choose from. The
Learning Unit that follows will disczuss a few strategies that we can use to approach our studies.
The tactics that follow are not intended as a complete or prescriptive list. What works for one
D
learner may not work for others. Students should take ideas and determine for themselves what
might work for them.
This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:
1. Understand one potential note taking method called Cornell Notes
2. Learn about Retrieval Practice
3. Understand Spaced Practice
4. Explore the SQ3R and PQ4R Method
5. Examine the Feynman Technique
6. Understand the Leitner System
While each student will learn at their own pace, this Learning Unit should take about ten minutes
to complete.
Since this Learning Unit is intended as a reference list of tactics, we will not provide challenge
questions at the end as we have with other Learning Units in this Module.

4.5.1 Cornell Notes
There are many different note taking systems. Let’s briefly examine one called Cornell Notes,164
which was developed by a Cornell University Professor named Walter Pauk in the 1950s. This
method involves using a pen and paper, which helps with dual encoding.
The first step is to divide the page into three areas. These are the cue (on the left hand side of the
page), the notes (the large area on the right hand side of the page), and the summary (several
lines of space at the bottom of the page).
y

o
n

D
Figure 3: An Illustration of Cornell Notes
The cue might be questions we have about the text or key words or phrases. To illustrate an
example, let’s discuss a topic like password hashing. This topic might have key terms to learn
such as one-way encryption, salting, and cracking passwords. We might also have a question, for
example, “Are some hashing methods better than others?”
The notes section for that page should be directly related to the items in the cue section. For
example, near where we’ve written one-way encryption, we might write a long form definition of
what is meant by this term.

Finally, we will complete the summary section as we review our notes. To continue the example,
we might write “hashing a password = additional protection. Interested in more about cracking.”
The content here does not need to necessarily be directly related to the material - this is an
opportunity to reflect on our own interest, knowledge, and the study experience itself as well.
Later in this Module, we will explore how self-reflection can be helpful.
4.5.2 Retrieval Practice
Retrieval Practice is, as the name suggests, the practice of determining whether or not
information can be recalled.165,166 We can think of this simply as quizzing yourself.
This practice can take many forms, including covering our notes and trying to recall what was
written, or creating challenges or flashcards.
Let’s discuss flashcards first. The Leitner System167 is named for German scientist Sebastian
y
Leitner and involves making flashcards as a method to review and repeat learning. Both the act of
creating and then practicing with flashcards can be incredibly useful. A flashcard is a small paper
k
card that has a question or term on one side and then the answer or definition on the other side.
Practice involves reading the question and guessing the answer.
s
There are a multitude of applications that can help create flashcards, but consider the benefits of
taking small index cards and a pen or pencil and creating your own. The act of writing down the
o
information and creating our own flashcards is dual coding at its best.
This method can be used in a number of different ways, but often takes full advantage of Spaced
n
Practice as well as shuffling the cards and reviewing different cards on different days. The Leitner
System is not incredibly useful for learning methodologies and problem-solving skills, but can be
helpful when trying to memorize thinigs, like a particular tool’s syntax.
z
Creating actual challenges can be difficult. Learners have a few options here. The most obvious is
to complete the included challenges for every Module. Whenever possible, these challenges do
D
not simply repeat the information or the methods included in the Module, but ask the student to
go just one step further. Another option is to return to a completed hands-on exercise and repeat
it. Finally, some courses include challenge labs, which are virtual machines that allow for a more
hands-on retrieval practice or self-testing.
4.5.3 Spaced Practice
Many students have had the experience of “cramming,” or staying up late to study and try to
memorize a lot of information on the night before a big exam. Any student who has tried this
method can attest to how ineffective it can be, especially just a few days after the exam has
concluded. Spaced practice168 is the opposite of this style of study.
Spaced practice has to do with the timing and duration of our study time. It is recommended to
spread out the study time over days and weeks rather than do it all at once. Long, “cramming”-

style study sessions actually take more time, often come at the expense of sleep, and (because
they overwhelm our cognitive load) are significantly less effective.
The exact duration and space between study sessions will be different for each individual. Taking
breaks and walking away from the computer screen for five or ten minutes can be very helpful.
Take a nap or get some sleep. Do an activity that has nothing to do with your studies at all to
space practice.
4.5.4 The SQ3R Method
The SQ3R method169 has students follow a pattern of study activities - survey, question, read,
recite, review. We will detail the SQ3R method here, but it is notably very similar to the PQ4R
method,170 which is useful for reading comprehension. Students who find the following tactic
useful may want to check out the PQ4R method as well.
y
A learner begins by surveying the topic, or reviewing a high level outline, scanning through the
material that might be covered during the study session. In particular, it would be important to
k
review any highlighted text, diagrams, and headings.
Let’s give an example. In the case of our current Modulse, a student might encounter the various
headings and subheadings: Learning Theory, Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills,
Offsec Training Methodology, and so on. They might then review the subheadings.
o
Next, they will create, preferably in writing, a list of questions that they hope to have answered via
the material. This may or may not reflect what the material will actually cover, but should be
n
based largely on the survey. This is a very important step, as learners will return to the questions
repeatedly.
i
Next, the student reads the materzial one section at a time. If there are videos or other activities for
this section, they can also complete those.
D
Next, the learner returns to their list of questions for that smaller section. They should try and
recite the questions back from memory and determine if they’re now able to answer them.
Finally, in the review, a student returns to all of the smaller sections from a larger topic or chapter
to check whether or not the questions have been answered and they can recall the answers.
For learners who have been taught that note taking is simply “writing down things that seem
important”, the SQ3R method represents an alternative that is much more effective.
4.5.5 The Feynman Technique
The Feynman Technique171 takes its name from Richard Feynman, a Nobel-prize winning physicist
with a unique gift for explaining complex topics in everyday terms. The technique that bears his
name has four simple steps:
1. Learn a Topic
169 (Virginia Tech, 2022), https://ucc.vt.edu/academic_support/study_skills_information/sq3r_reading-study_system.html

2. Explain it to a beginner
3. Identify gaps
4. Return to study
What makes this method of study unique is Step 2. Many descriptions of this technique use the
example of explaining the topic to a child who is unfamiliar with it. If we don’t have access to a
child (or a child who is willing to listen to an explanation about, for example, network scripting),
