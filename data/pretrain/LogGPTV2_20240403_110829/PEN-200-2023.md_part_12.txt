#### Listing 22 - Our Fix Worked!
Excellent! We were able to restore the execution permission for our script and run it successfully. It’s a relief to receive our list of employees again.

Let’s take it a step further and ensure that this issue doesn’t recur. We’ll attempt to use the `chmodfix` command on the original `chmod` file to fix things.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ ./chmodfix +x /usr/bin/chmod
```

**Output:**
```bash
./chmodfix: changing permissions of '/usr/bin/chmod': Operation not permitted
```

#### Listing 23 - Another Obstacle
We’ve encountered another obstacle. We don’t have the necessary permissions to modify `/usr/bin/chmod`. The system is configured so that an average user cannot alter system files in `/usr/bin/` (like `chmod`). Copying the file or its contents is allowed, but we are trying to write to a file in that directory, which is not permitted.

Currently, we are running the command as the `kali` user. Let’s try running the command again, but this time with superuser privileges using the `sudo` command. The system will prompt us for our password.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo ./chmodfix +x /usr/bin/chmod
[sudo] password for kali:
```

#### Listing 24 - Yo Dawg, I Heard You Like Chmod, So I Chmod +x Your Chmod
This worked.

It may be too early to call ourselves “hackers,” but finding unique ways to gain permissions unintended by a particular system is at the core of cybersecurity. This quick example offers a solid start.

### 4.4.4 Analyzing This Approach
If much of the preceding example was new to you, congratulations! You’ve survived your first bit of cybersecurity training. Remember, the actual solutions and commands aren’t as important as understanding how this material was taught.

Although we covered a relatively simple section from our written training, let’s take a moment to examine how we taught this material. We’ll highlight a few key aspects:

1. **Using the Demonstration Method**
2. **Learning by Doing**
3. **Focusing on the Skill, Not the Tool**
4. **Interleaving**
5. **Expecting the Unexpected**

#### Using the Demonstration Method
The demonstration method is used in both the tone and voice of the example, as well as in the series of actions we follow. We don’t skip steps, including verifying whether our solutions worked.

Notably, we encounter a problem (not being able to execute our script) almost immediately, which represents the real-world, day-to-day experience of students after the course has ended. Research supports problem-solving as an effective learning strategy for engagement and retention.163

#### Learning by Doing
Learning by doing is an area where students can take control of their learning and accelerate their growth. The best way to do this is to follow along. In the case presented in this module, it would have been difficult to follow along manually. Normally, a module will include at least one virtual machine specifically set up to allow learners to follow the accompanying text. For this example, we would have used a Linux machine with our `find_employee_names.py` script on it.

#### Focusing on the Skill, Not the Tool
If you are already familiar with `chmod`, you may have noticed that we chose one of many different methods to use this tool. We did not explore how the permissions for our script (before we were able to execute it) could have been represented with the numerical expression 644, which we could have fixed by running `chmod 755`.

It’s almost impossible to remember every specific command and syntax, and piling on too much information increases cognitive load, making it more difficult to remember the material later. Even experienced security researchers look things up, so we encourage learners to focus on why a command is being run rather than what command is being run.

#### Interleaving
Interleaving is inevitable in hands-on training. In the context of education, interleaving involves mixing multiple subjects. In this case, we reviewed the `touch`, `cat`, and `ls` commands, even though they weren’t directly related to the main topic. They were, however, related to our ability to modify `chmod` and our employee name script.

Another way to think about this is that OffSec training materials are organized around concepts, not commands.

#### Expecting the Unexpected
Teaching learners to expect the unexpected is not always easy. However, we often accomplish this by taking an indirect route to our goal, highlighting issues you may experience in the field. We hope to convey the logic behind our decisions instead of simply presenting commands and syntax.

In this example, we mentioned a potential pitfall with directory permissions (in a sidebar). We also knew that `./chmodfix +x /usr/bin/chmod` wouldn’t work, but we included it and ran it. We often walk through “unexpected” scenarios when presenting new modules and include unexpected outcomes in many of our challenges.

As students, it’s imperative to grow comfortable in situations we don’t fully understand and try things that might not work. The only way to really be prepared for the “unexpected” is to become comfortable in situations where we don’t know exactly how things will pan out.

We cannot afford to avoid situations where we might feel stuck. In cybersecurity, it’s extremely rare that the first approach we try works. OffSec’s approach is to teach the material in such a way that students can become more resilient and agile, working through a particular problem until they are “unstuck.”

There is often more than one way to accomplish any goal, and we encourage you to attempt other paths to reaching the goals we present. A curious learner might ask if, in the example presented, we could solve the issue by simply running `sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/chmod`. This is exactly the sort of thinking we encourage, and why many of the challenges are presented in a virtual environment where learners can experiment and try things. Trying out an approach that doesn’t work is also a valuable learning experience.

This experiment-and-experiment-again mindset is at the heart of what we believe it takes to be highly successful in this field. The goal of our training is always to teach the methodology and the mindset.

### 4.5 Tactics and Common Methods
Next, we need to think about strategy and tactics. Consider the following quote from Sun Tzu:

> "Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat."

In the most basic sense, we can think of strategy as a long-term vision, while tactics are the short-term, immediate actions we take. Strategy is the map, and tactics are the steps.

For learners in a formal school structure, the strategy and tactics of study are often built into the school structure itself. A student’s schedule, topics of study, and even how they approach the learning material are all dictated by the school district or the instructor.

In the absence of that rigid school structure, a common mistake of adult learners is to approach their studies casually, without thinking about either tactics or strategy. We might know, for example, that it’s important to “take notes,” but what exactly should we be writing down? And what should we do with those notes?

This Learning Unit will present a series of specific tactics for learners to choose from. The Learning Unit that follows will discuss a few strategies that we can use to approach our studies.

The tactics that follow are not intended as a complete or prescriptive list. What works for one learner may not work for others. Students should take ideas and determine for themselves what might work for them.

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:
1. Understand one potential note-taking method called Cornell Notes.
2. Learn about Retrieval Practice.
3. Understand Spaced Practice.
4. Explore the SQ3R and PQ4R Method.
5. Examine the Feynman Technique.
6. Understand the Leitner System.

While each student will learn at their own pace, this Learning Unit should take about ten minutes to complete.

Since this Learning Unit is intended as a reference list of tactics, we will not provide challenge questions at the end as we have with other Learning Units in this Module.

### 4.5.1 Cornell Notes
There are many different note-taking systems. Let’s briefly examine one called Cornell Notes,164 which was developed by a Cornell University Professor named Walter Pauk in the 1950s. This method involves using a pen and paper, which helps with dual encoding.

The first step is to divide the page into three areas:
- **Cue**: On the left-hand side of the page.
- **Notes**: The large area on the right-hand side of the page.
- **Summary**: Several lines of space at the bottom of the page.

The cue might be questions we have about the text or key words or phrases. To illustrate an example, let’s discuss a topic like password hashing. This topic might have key terms to learn such as one-way encryption, salting, and cracking passwords. We might also have a question, for example, “Are some hashing methods better than others?”

The notes section for that page should be directly related to the items in the cue section. For example, near where we’ve written one-way encryption, we might write a long-form definition of what is meant by this term.

Finally, we will complete the summary section as we review our notes. To continue the example, we might write “hashing a password = additional protection. Interested in more about cracking.” The content here does not need to be directly related to the material; this is an opportunity to reflect on our own interest, knowledge, and the study experience itself.

Later in this Module, we will explore how self-reflection can be helpful.

### 4.5.2 Retrieval Practice
Retrieval Practice is, as the name suggests, the practice of determining whether or not information can be recalled.165,166 We can think of this simply as quizzing yourself.

This practice can take many forms, including covering our notes and trying to recall what was written, or creating challenges or flashcards.

Let’s discuss flashcards first. The Leitner System167 is named for German scientist Sebastian Leitner and involves making flashcards as a method to review and repeat learning. Both the act of creating and then practicing with flashcards can be incredibly useful. A flashcard is a small paper card that has a question or term on one side and the answer or definition on the other side. Practice involves reading the question and guessing the answer.

There are many applications that can help create flashcards, but consider the benefits of taking small index cards and a pen or pencil and creating your own. The act of writing down the information and creating our own flashcards is dual coding at its best.

This method can be used in a number of different ways, but often takes full advantage of Spaced Practice as well as shuffling the cards and reviewing different cards on different days. The Leitner System is not incredibly useful for learning methodologies and problem-solving skills, but can be helpful when trying to memorize things, like a particular tool’s syntax.

Creating actual challenges can be difficult. Learners have a few options here. The most obvious is to complete the included challenges for every Module. Whenever possible, these challenges do not simply repeat the information or the methods included in the Module, but ask the student to go just one step further. Another option is to return to a completed hands-on exercise and repeat it. Finally, some courses include challenge labs, which are virtual machines that allow for more hands-on retrieval practice or self-testing.

### 4.5.3 Spaced Practice
Many students have had the experience of “cramming,” or staying up late to study and try to memorize a lot of information on the night before a big exam. Any student who has tried this method can attest to how ineffective it can be, especially just a few days after the exam has concluded. Spaced practice168 is the opposite of this style of study.

Spaced practice has to do with the timing and duration of our study time. It is recommended to spread out the study time over days and weeks rather than do it all at once. Long, “cramming”-style study sessions actually take more time, often come at the expense of sleep, and (because they overwhelm our cognitive load) are significantly less effective.

The exact duration and space between study sessions will be different for each individual. Taking breaks and walking away from the computer screen for five or ten minutes can be very helpful. Take a nap or get some sleep. Do an activity that has nothing to do with your studies to space practice.

### 4.5.4 The SQ3R Method
The SQ3R method169 has students follow a pattern of study activities: survey, question, read, recite, review. We will detail the SQ3R method here, but it is notably very similar to the PQ4R method,170 which is useful for reading comprehension. Students who find the following tactic useful may want to check out the PQ4R method as well.

A learner begins by surveying the topic, or reviewing a high-level outline, scanning through the material that might be covered during the study session. In particular, it would be important to review any highlighted text, diagrams, and headings.

For example, in the case of our current Module, a student might encounter the various headings and subheadings: Learning Theory, Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills, Offsec Training Methodology, and so on. They might then review the subheadings.

Next, they will create, preferably in writing, a list of questions that they hope to have answered via the material. This may or may not reflect what the material will actually cover, but should be based largely on the survey. This is a very important step, as learners will return to the questions repeatedly.

Next, the student reads the material one section at a time. If there are videos or other activities for this section, they can also complete those.

Next, the learner returns to their list of questions for that smaller section. They should try and recite the questions back from memory and determine if they’re now able to answer them.

Finally, in the review, a student returns to all of the smaller sections from a larger topic or chapter to check whether or not the questions have been answered and they can recall the answers.

For learners who have been taught that note-taking is simply “writing down things that seem important,” the SQ3R method represents an alternative that is much more effective.

### 4.5.5 The Feynman Technique
The Feynman Technique171 takes its name from Richard Feynman, a Nobel-prize winning physicist with a unique gift for explaining complex topics in everyday terms. The technique that bears his name has four simple steps:

1. **Learn a Topic**
2. **Explain it to a Beginner**
3. **Identify Gaps**
4. **Return to Study**

What makes this method of study unique is Step 2. Many descriptions of this technique use the example of explaining the topic to a child who is unfamiliar with it. If we don’t have access to a child (or a child who is willing to listen to an explanation about, for example, network scripting), we can still apply the principle by simplifying the explanation and identifying any gaps in our understanding.
