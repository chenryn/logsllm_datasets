### CVE-2022-33891: Apache Spark Shell Command Injection Vulnerability via Spark UI

#### Affected Versions
- Apache Spark versions 3.0.3 and earlier
- Versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2
- Versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1

#### Analysis

**Official Description**
The official description of the vulnerability can be found at:
- [Apache Security Advisory](https://lists.apache.org/thread/p847l3kopoo5bjtmxrcwk21xp6tjxqlc)

**Code Diff**
The code changes that address this vulnerability are available at:
- [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36315/files)

**Vulnerability Explanation**
The vulnerability arises from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input into a command, leading to a command injection. This is evident in the code diff, where no sanitization or validation is performed on the input before it is used in a shell command.

**Triggering the Vulnerability**
To understand how to trigger this vulnerability, refer to the security configuration documentation:
- [Spark Security Configuration](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.3/security.html)

**Minimal Configuration for Exploitation**
A minimal configuration to exploit this vulnerability might include the following settings. Note that these settings may not be the best for ACL-related configurations but are sufficient for vulnerability research purposes. Optional parameters are indicated by square brackets `[]`.

```bash
./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.acls.enable=true --conf spark.ui.port=8099 --conf spark.ui.view.acls=true [--conf spark.user.groups.mapping=org.apache.spark.security.ShellBasedGroupsMappingProvider]
```

**Call Chain Analysis**
The call chain leading to the vulnerability involves the following methods:

1. `org.apache.spark.ui.HttpSecurityFilter.doFilter()`
2. `org.apache.spark.SecurityManager.checkUIViewPermissions()`
3. `org.apache.spark.SecurityManager.isUserInACL()`
4. `org.apache.spark.util.Utils.getCurrentUserGroups()`
5. `org.apache.spark.security.ShellBasedGroupsMappingProvider.getGroups()`
6. `org.apache.spark.security.ShellBasedGroupsMappingProvider.getUnixGroups()`

**HttpSecurityFilter**
`HttpSecurityFilter` is a filter that handles permission checks for all routes. This can be verified by examining the relevant code snippet:

```scala
val securityFilter = new HttpSecurityFilter(conf, securityMgr)
val holder = new FilterHolder(securityFilter)
handler.addFilter(holder, "/*", EnumSet.allOf(classOf[DispatcherType]))
```

The `doAs` method is used to execute the filter, which processes the user-supplied input. This lack of input validation and sanitization leads to the command injection vulnerability.

By understanding the call chain and the configuration, one can identify and mitigate the vulnerability in affected versions of Apache Spark.
