many of which i can’t drive to…
Packing & the Friendly Skies

my bags used to get opened a lot

now, i fly with firearms all the time

flying with firearms…
• it’s easier than you think
• it’s relatively hassle-free
• it results in major security
Packing & the Friendly Skies
Deviant Ollam
facts and the law…
• federal standards
(mostly uniform, specifics can vary by airline… but no one can abridge your rights)
• checked bag only, unloaded
(do i really have to tell you that?)
• non-TSA lock
(no one else gets the key or combo)
• declared upon check-in
Packing & the Friendly Skies

specifics about packing…
• hard case, size can vary
(i’ll assume you’ll use larger luggage to leverage the law to your advantage)
• ammo policies can vary a lot by airline
(how it’s packed, how much you can carry, same luggage or separately)
• bags may not be opened once secured
(unless you are present)
• no outside indicator labels of any kind
(27 CFR 478.31 - Delivery by Common or Contract Carrier, 18 USC Section 922e)

some extra pointers that can
make the whole process
easier, better, faster, stronger…
Packing & the Friendly Skies

extra pointers…
• don’t be a dumbass when you declare
• name tags on everything, inside and out
• keep cases locked as much as possible
(better to be asked five times to open them than to send them away unsecured)
• getting  to secondary screening area
• no outside indicator labels of any kind
(that’s US federal law, other nations have own standards)
Federal law states: “No common or contract carrier shall require or cause any label, tag, or
other written notice to be placed on the outside of any package, luggage, or other container
that such package, luggage, or other container contains a firearm.”
18 USC Section 922(e)

more tips…
• insurance coverage can vary
• possible to play with weight a bit
• inside other luggage? sure, but why?
• not just “functional” firearms…
Packing & the Friendly Skies
Deviant Ollam
what counts as a firearm?
• proper guns
• flare guns
• starter / blank pistols
• airsoft pieces
• replica weapons
• gun parts & hardware?
the law specifies “firearms” which, by definition, expel a projectile by means of a combustible
propellant… but essentially, they want to avoid screeners or automated x-ray equipment seeing
anything that looks like a firearm when they weren’t expecting to encounter it.
