Technologies linking sea and space have played a deﬁning
role enabling the global economy that has shaped modern
life. Ensuring that these networks remain defended against
ever more sophisticated and capable attackers will be key to
preserving these beneﬁts.

APPENDIX A
GSEXTRACT IMPLEMENTATION
This appendix details the general approach used by the
GSExtract tool to parse corrupted and incomplete raw DVB-
S2 streams containing GSE data feeds. Several novel strategies
are used to simplify the data extraction challenge to its core
dimensions and reduce the complexity of an otherwise highly
variable set of protocol standards. While these techniques may
have some academic value, given the potential for abuse we
have elected not to release GSExtract until the issues identiﬁed
in this study are addressed by a signiﬁcant proportion of the
maritime VSAT industry. This appendix is thus intended to
provide technical insight into the techniques employed which
may be of academic interest without releasing a fully featured
attack tool to the general public. A simpliﬁed overview of
the entire GSExtract data extraction process can be found in
Figure 22 at the end of this section.
The ﬁrst step in parsing raw transponder streams is to
extract individual baseband frames (BBFrames). BBFrames
are the lowest-level logical encapsulation layer inside a de-
modulated DVB-S2 stream. Each BBFrame begins with a
10-byte BBHEADER as deﬁned by ETSI EN 302 307 and
summarized in Figure 20 [17]. The most important portion of
this header for our purposes is the two byte Data Field Length
(DFL) value which indicates the overall size of the data-ﬁeld
which follows the BBHEADER and the location in the stream
where the next BBFrame begins. Additionally, the ﬁnal byte
of the BBHEADER contains a CRC-8 (using the polynomial
represented by 0xD5) which protects the BBHEADER from
corruption. In theory, the ﬁrst two bytes of the BBHEADER,
collectively referred to as the MATYPE may change arbitrarily
in an Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) feed. However,
in practice, we observed that such changes occurred only
rarely and that, in particular, the second byte of the MATYPE
header in marine VSAT implementations was almost always
0x00. This observation, acted as a ‘crib’ which signiﬁcantly
simpliﬁed GSExtract’s identiﬁcation of corrupted and invalid
BBFrames.
Fig. 20: The structure of a DVB-S2 BBFrame Header
To extract BBFrames, GSExtract ﬁrst attempts to identify
a valid 2-byte MATYPE in the recorded raw DVB-S2 stream.
This value can be identiﬁed through statistical analysis of a
portion of the DVB-S2 recording where it will appear as one of
the most frequently recurring 2-byte sequences. To validate this
identiﬁcation, the CRC-8 value in byte 10 of the BBHEADER
can be used to conﬁrm whether a 9-byte sequence beginning
with the MATYPE is a plausible BBHEADER.
One the correct MATYPE has been found, it is possible
to parse the stream into complete BBFrames using the DFL
BBHEADER value. Generally, the next BBFrame will begin
immediately after the the end of the previous BBFrame’s
data ﬁeld. However, in the case of signal processing errors,
the data ﬁeld may be truncated. In order to resolve issues
15

two bytes are required but the header can be of arbitrary length
depending on the addition of optional extensions.
with lower-end equipment, we thus validate each subsequent
BBFrame header by checking its MATYPE against the known
good value. While this decreases compatibility with some
complex implementations that may use multiple MATYPEs
in a single stream, for the maritime VSAT operators that we
observed, these protocol features did not appear to be in use.
This approach to error recovery ensures that no more than
2 BBFrames worth of data are lost as the result of a single
signal processing failure. In most cases, only a fraction of a
single corrupted frame is discarded before GSExtract recovers
its synchronization with the DVB-S2 stream.
Next, we extract bytes up the the length indicated by the
DFL BBHEADER value, less four bytes at the end of the
BBFrame. While these four trailing bytes are not mentioned
in the relevant DVB-S2 speciﬁcations, both service operators
analyzed appeared to reserve these four bytes for a CRC-32
checksum calculated across the entire BBFrame.
Next, the contents of an extracted BBFrame are further
parsed into GSE packets. GSE packets follow a format speci-
ﬁed in ETSI TS 102 606 and outlined in Figure 21 [16]. Each
GSE packet has a variable-length header of at least 2-bytes
which includes a 12bit integer indicating the overall length
of the GSE packet. Unlike indicated in the GSE standard, we
found that for both maritime VSAT operators this value was the
length of the entire GSE packet rather than the number of bytes
which followed the mandatory 2-byte header. An arbitrary
number of additional optional headers exist depending on the
type of GSE packet encoded. Of particular importance are the
headers related to GSE fragmentation. When a payload exceeds
the maximum size of an individual GSE packet, it may be
fragmented across several. This fragmentation process uses a
1-byte identiﬁer to label related fragments and the entirety of
any given fragmented payload must be completed within 255
BBFrames. GSExtract attempts to deal with fragmentation by
combining related fragments as they are identiﬁed. In a case
where all fragments are not successfully identiﬁed with a range
of 255 BBFrames (e.g. due to signal corruption), GSExtract
will attempt to recover partially completed GSE packets by
padding the remaining bytes of the GSE payloads with null
values (0x00). Individual GSE packets cannot traverse multiple
BBFrames. Thus, if the ﬁnal GSE packet inside a BBFrame
appears truncated this can be taken as an indication of signal
processing error and the broken GSE packet will be discarded
by GSExtract.

or re-assembled fragmented payloads, GSExtract will attempt
to parse the payloads as if they contain raw IPv4 and IPv6
packets. At present, GSExtract is focused on IP based proto-
cols. However, the process for parsing non-IP trafﬁc should be
largely the same as that currently employed by the utility. Once
an IP packet is successfully parsed from the raw payloads, it
is converted into a .pcap compatible format and stored for
analysis.
Given the high frequency of signal processing errors caused
by the use of low-end equipment, many of the IP payloads
identiﬁed by GSExtract will appear abruptly truncated due to
missing data. In these cases, the remainder of the IP packet
length is optionally padded with null bytes (0x00) to ensure
compatibility with packet analysis tools like Wireshark.
