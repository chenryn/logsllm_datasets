I initially installed Python 3.2, but when I opened WingIDE on my Mac, it only recognized the older version, Python 2.6.1. I attempted to use the "Configure Python" option and entered the path to Python 3.2 in the "Python Executable" field, but this did not resolve the issue; WingIDE continued to show Python 2.6.1.

Upon relaunching WingIDE, it unexpectedly recognized Python 3.2 without any additional changes from my side. However, when using the terminal, it still only recognizes Python 2.6.1.

Assistant: The behavior you're experiencing may be influenced by the version of macOS you are running. For instance, if you are using a custom installation of Python 2.7 on macOS 10.6.7, you might need to modify your `~/.bash_profile` file to include the following line:

```bash
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin:${PATH}"
```

To ensure that the terminal also recognizes Python 3.2, you should check the directory `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions` to find the full path to your Python 3.2 installation. You can then update the `PATH` variable in your `~/.bash_profile` with the appropriate path, such as:

```bash
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2/bin:${PATH}"
```

After making these changes, you should reload the `~/.bash_profile` or open a new terminal session to apply the updated `PATH`.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your macOS version and the exact paths of your Python installations, and I can offer further assistance.
