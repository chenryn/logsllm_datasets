User: I installed python 3.2 edition, but when I opened wingIDE, my MAC still only show the old edition phthon 2.6.1. I tried to use "configure python"-enter python3.2 in "python executable", then found nothing changed, python 2.6.1 still appeared in wingIDE. Any suggestion?

I just tried to launch WINGIDE again and this time it indicates the python 3.2, the newest edition i installed. hmmmm, funny, i didn't change anything and it recognized it now! But when i use terminal, it still only recognize python 2.6.
Assistant: This may depend on the version of OSX you are running. I did a custom install of python 2.7 on my machine running 10.6.7 and had to modify ~/.bash_profile with the following line:
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin:${PATH}"
You may want to check the directory /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions and see what the full path is to your 3.2 install. You could then modify the PATH variable in your ~/.bash_profile like this:
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/YOUR_VERSION_NUM/bin:${PATH}"
