case, one more AS will have information about the client (in
reality, more ASes are likely to exist on the path). Figure 19
shows the relation between the AS of the authority (x-axis)
and the AS of the service (y-axis). The diagonal on the plot
depicts cases where the authority and the service are located
within the same AS. To generate Figure 19 and Figure 20, we
used the 2019 Alexa data from subsection IV-B. We associated
each authority and domain IP with the ASN according to the
Route Views dataset [45].
One thing that stands out from Figure 19 is that
this
kind of visualization is problematic because there is a lot of
empty space (i.e., ASN numbers that are not used either in
the authority or the RDATA axis). For that reason, we also
created Figure 20, which is practically Figure 19 without the
empty space (collapsing the plot to only include valid data
points). Since each of the axes has different ASes (because
some of the authority ASN may not have complete overlap
with the RDATA ASN and vice versa), the actual diagonal is
comprised of different ASNs per axis. However, if both the
ASN for RDATA and authority are the same, it will be a dot
near the diagonal. The ideal diagonal now looks like a crooked
line but still stands out.
For reference, we examine some of the top 10 authority
ASNs (that are related to the most RDATA ASN). Namely,
AS 13335 belongs to CloudFlare, AS 26496 to GoDaddy, AS
16509 to Amazon, and AS 396576 to VeriSign. Obviously,
these organizations are afﬁliated with CDNs, cloud services
and domain name registrations (and thus parking) and that
behavior is expected. In any case, every point in the plot apart
from the diagonal in Figure 19 and the “crooked” diagonal
in Figure 20 corresponds to cases where the RDATA (web
server) and the authority (DNS Server) ASN are separate.
Therefore there is potential information leakage to a different
entity. There is no arguing that in the above cases, this occurs
predominantly. The outsourcing phenomenon is a characteristic
of the modern web.
Finally, to estimate the potential of a leak when a DNS
resolution request arrives at any of the authorities, we mea-
sured the number of ASes that the authority’s AS peers with.
We use the Shadowserver [42] API to identify peers for the
CIDRs that announce the IP addresses of the authorities for
ECS-enabled domains. Figure 21 shows the distribution of
peers for each domain name. The majority of the domains
are served by authorities that are located in ASes with three,
four, or eight peers. Any of those peers, along with other ASes
until a packet reaches them, is a potential collector of activity
from ECS-enabled DNS packets.
Essentially, we ﬁnd that a large number of the domain
names that utilize ECS use third-party DNS providers. This
means that the DNS infrastructure of these domains resides

System that hosts an ECS-enabled authority. The vast majority of the
authorities reside in ASs that have three, four, or eight peers, which
can be potential alternative paths for a DNS resolution request and
one more collection point for entities involved.
in a separate network with a different AS and administrator.
Thus, the IP information included in the new ECS-enabled
DNS packets is shared with third parties unknown to the client
for no immediately discernible reason. Considering the lack of
a diverse hosting infrastructure for these domains, there is no
beneﬁt from enabling ECS. Similarly, ECS enabled domains
provide IP information to third parties on-path during the
resolution process. This partial information (e.g., a /24) would
otherwise be unavailable to anyone other than the recursive
itself.
V. RELATED WORK
The interaction of DNS and anonymity networks has been
well studied. Krishnan et al. [29] have shown how DNS
prefetching can leak information regarding users’ activity on-
line to the degree that information regarding web searches can
be inferred by simply logging a browser’s resolution requests.
Zhao et al. [46] perform a deep analysis on each step of a
domain name resolution process, showing information that can
be inferred from users’ private data by only looking at public
data. They also propose a simple range query scheme that can
be used to protect the user. In the same context, Guha and
Francis [22] describe an attack against the DNS, by passively
monitoring DNS related trafﬁc, that can provide a variety of
information about a user that includes location, habits, and
commute patterns. Moreover, Bortzmeyer, in RFC 7626 [11]
attempts to enumerate the attacks and privacy implications,
aggregated into six different categories, made possible only
using DNS; they concluded their work with several security
considerations on the matter. Lastly, Bortzmeyer also describes
potential privacy issues and attacks via monitoring DNS trafﬁc
and examining the domain names included in packets, which
can be solved by implementing RFC 7816 [12].
On the other hand, ECS is a relatively new technology
and is motivated by the performance challenges related to the
growing use of public recursives [16], as discussed by Huang et
al. [26]. The guidelines in the corresponding RFC [15] provide
a general outline on the how ECS should be deployed and how
ECS-enabled servers should be operated. Streibelt et al. [43]
demonstrate how one could utilize ECS-enabled authorities to
uncover details about the infrastructure of an ECS-enabled
13
zone and how it is being used by the owner. Recently, Al-
Dalky et al.
[7] study a more speciﬁc aspect of ECS that
has to do with the caching behavior of DNS resolvers when
it comes to ECS enabled answers and the variety of different
caching behaviors that can be examined. Our work focuses on
a long-term study of the behavior and adoption of ECS. Lastly,
Otto et al. [40] have measured how the adoption of ECS can
increase the accuracy, with which authorities can identify a
client’s geographic location and provide better content delivery.
VI. DISCUSSION
Considering that currently, ECS is enabled by default
depending on the recursive used, the user has limited ability to
control the amount of information shared using ECS, and so
we would like to discuss the options available to the users. The
RFC mentions that the user can signal the maximum resolution
of the scope netmask that can be used by setting it in the initial
request to the recursive, and the recursive should follow the
resolution that the user’s stub set. By setting a scope netmask
of /0 the user can effectively opt out of using ECS while
also not taking advantage of the beneﬁts that ECS provides.
Another option that the user has is to set a netmask more
coarse than the default used /24 resolution. That will balance
privacy and allow for more content delivery optimization by
services that beneﬁt from ECS. The issue with this approach
is that no user-facing stub resolver currently allows for this
setting level. Support for ECS scope netmask setting needs
to be added to stub resolvers. Another potential issue is that
currently, not all the recursives implement the RFC correctly
but default to a different netmask, disobeying the netmask set
by the user, similar to cases mentioned in Section IV-C2.
From the side of website operators, we can only comment
that they should only enable ECS responses when they perform
some form of trafﬁc optimization. Considering the number of
domains that seem to support ECS but do not beneﬁt from the
protocol, we believe that a large number of managed domain
hosting enables ECS by default. Another interesting approach
is the discussion around more privacy-minded ECS imple-
mentation that was presented in a publication by NextDNS’s
Olivier Poitrey [41]. This approach relies on the geographical
awareness of the Autonomous Systems that
the recursive
resolver serves and depends on providing a geographically
relevant IP portion to the authority instead of the user’s IP
address portion. As for the more privacy-conscious user, the
standard privacy-preserving methods of browsing the web such
as VPNs and the Tor network will still provide the user the
ability to hide their IP from an ECS enabled authority. A more
straightforward solution would be to manually set the DNS
servers that the user prefers and thus choose a set of recursive
resolvers that do not send ECS information. On the other hand,
with any of these solutions, the user will not be able to take
advantage of ECS’s beneﬁts.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a longitudinal study measuring
the adoption of a DNS extension called ECS. Given the
widespread usage of DNS in IP based networks, the goal
of our work was to identify how changes introduced by
this extension affect network communications that rely on
DNS. This analysis serves as a case study that explores the
14
unintended consequences, both good and bad, of introducing
small changes to fundamental network protocols.
The primary goal of ECS was to optimize CDN selection
through the use of DNS, but our analysis found that most sites
in the Alexa top million do not receive any beneﬁt from ECS
(Section IV-D). This result demonstrates how new functionality
may not always get used as intended, and therefore, it is
essential to consider potential unintended consequences. For
example, we identiﬁed that most authoritative DNS servers
using ECS adhere to the proposed defaults and set an IP subnet
mask of /24 (Section IV-A). The use of small subnet masks
results in the sharing of ﬁne-grained client information with
DNS nameservers above the recursive DNS server. We found
that the majority of ECS-enabled domain names outsource
their DNS infrastructure (Section IV-E). As a result, more
networks now have ﬁne-grained client information for DNS
on-path DNS communication. Thus, we ﬁnd ECS potentially
exacerbates the effects of existing threats such as DNS leaks.
These consequences raise questions about the scope of
impact. Our analysis ﬁnds that, despite being optional, ECS
has seen steady adoption over time (Section IV-B). Thus, the
unintended consequences of ECS are not limited to a small
subset of Internet communications. As a result, authoritative
DNS servers—and all DNS nameservers above the recursive
for that matter—now have visibility about the client networks
querying them. This client information enables DNS operators
to track client networks and user behaviors in ways that were
not possible before ECS (Section IV-C). At the same time, this
same information can also help security practitioners track new
threats or aid remediation efforts when local network visibility
is limited.
Ultimately, we ﬁnd that ECS has impacted a large volume
of DNS trafﬁc on the Internet. It is widely deployed and
used by domains all across the Alexa top million. As a
result, security practitioners should be aware of its pitfalls and
potential uses for good.
