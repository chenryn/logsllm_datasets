User: How to use Python code to crawl a specified website? Please use requests and beautifulsoup libraries to write crawler scripts and parse webpage content.
Assistant: The following is an example of Python code to crawl a specified website: ```python import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup url = 'https://www.example.com' headers = { 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/ 5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'} response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, ' html.parser') # Print page title print(soup.title.string) # Print all links links = [] for link in soup.find_all('a'): links.append(link.get('href') ) print(links) ``` First, we need to define the URL of the website to be crawled and the request header. Then, use the requests library to send a network request to the URL and parse the response. Finally, we can use the beautifulsoup library to parse the HTML content and extract the information we need. In this example, we extracted the page title and all links.
