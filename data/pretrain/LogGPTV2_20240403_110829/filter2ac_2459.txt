### Title: Project Zero: Five Years of "Making 0-Day Exploits Harder"

This year marks the fifth anniversary of Project Zero, an applied security research team at Google dedicated to making 0-day exploits more difficult. The journey so far has been both challenging and exhilarating, as we have delved into a wide array of sophisticated and unique attacks. Our work has encompassed full-chain browser exploits, remote WiFi firmware attacks, and the ongoing challenges posed by Flash. We have also explored kernel and userland privilege escalation across multiple operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, iOS, and Android. Additionally, we have investigated hypervisor escapes and the intricacies of speculative execution.

Throughout this period, we have published a vast and diverse array of vulnerabilities and exploits. But why do we do this? How do we approach our work, and what does it mean for user security? This presentation offers a behind-the-scenes look at Project Zero's efforts and provides a retrospective assessment of the impact of our work.

We will explore the reasons why a team like Project Zero is essential, and discuss the core principles that guide our decision-making. We will delve into some of the most notable findings from our portfolio, sharing the technical insights we have gained along the way. Finally, we will reflect on the lessons learned and outline our vision for the next five years of Project Zero.
