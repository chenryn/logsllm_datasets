ABSTRACT
Given the abundance of cameras and LCDs in today’s en-
vironment, there exists an untapped opportunity for us-
ing these devices for communication. Speciﬁcally, cameras
can tune to nearby LCDs and use them for network access.
The key feature of these LCD-camera links is that they are
highly directional and hence enable a form of interference-
free wireless communication. This makes them an attractive
technology for dense, high contention scenarios. The main
challenge, however, to enable such LCD-camera links is to
maximize coverage, that is to deliver multiple Mb/s over
multi-meter distances, independent of the view angle. To
do so, these links need to address unique types of channel
distortions, such as perspective distortion and blur.
In this demo, we show how these LCD-camera links can be
used to wirelessly transmit information. We present PixNet,
an LCD-camera communication system. PixNet generalizes
the popular OFDM transmission algorithms to address the
unique properties of the LCD-camera link, including per-
spective distortion and blur. We have built a prototype of
PixNet using oﬀ-the-shelf LCDs and cameras. In our demo,
we will show our prototype communicating data from an
LCD to a camera-equipped PC, over multi-meter distances
and wide viewing angles.

1. MOTIVATION AND RELATED WORK
Cameras and LCDs are abundant in today’s environment,
both in stand-alone form and embedded in laptops, smart
phones, and PDAs. This abundance creates an untapped op-
portunity for using these devices for wireless communication.
For example, LCDs mounted on walls or ceilings can encode

data into visual frames, allowing camera-equipped devices to
download this information. The key feature of such LCD-
camera links is that they are interference-free. This is due
to the short wavelengths in the visible light spectrum that
makes the communication link highly directional. Thus, a
multitude of such links can operate simultaneously in a dense
area, such as in a conference scenario or a hotspot. Hence,
LCD-camera links can potentially evolve into a new wireless
technology that is useful in dense high-contention scenarios,
similar to how Bluetooth targets low-power scenarios, and
whitespaces target long-range communication.
While they oﬀer new opportunities, LCD-camera links
bring about new challenges. Speciﬁcally, an LCD-camera
link exhibits three main types of distortions:
• Perspective distortion. Since they operate in the vis-
ible light spectrum, LCD-camera links require line of
sight. This requirement limits coverage and hence em-
phasizes the importance of a ﬂexible design that allows
an LCD and camera to communicate in the presence
of viewing angles. If an LCD and a camera can com-
municate in the presence of view angles, similar to how
a human sees a screen even when he looks at it from
an angle, coverage is signiﬁcantly extended. The chal-
lenge is that the image of a rectangular screen becomes
a trapezoid when viewed from an angle, as shown in
Fig. 1(a).
• Blur. Any handshaking or movement while capturing
an image or a lack of focus can introduce blur in the
image, which causes the pixels to blend together, as
in Fig. 1(b). An LCD-camera communication system
must be able to deal with such blending and still suc-
cessfully recover the transmitted bits.
• Ambient Light. Ambient light is a source of noise for
LCD-camera links because it changes the luminance of
the received pixels. This can cause errors in the infor-
mation encoded in the pixels, resulting in information
loss at the receiver.
Thus, the LCD-camera channel needs a new transmission
scheme that can handle the above distortions, which are sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent from the distortions seen in RF channels.
Past work in the area of computer graphics has looked
at these problems in the context of 2D barcodes, e.g., QR
code [1] or Data matrix [2]. These codes are printed on walls
or objects. Users with a camera phone can take a picture
of these barcodes, decode them, and obtain a description of
the attached object or surrounding space [7, 8]. Barcodes

however have relatively low information density and must be
read at close proximity [3, 5]. In contrast, we focus on de-
veloping an LCD-camera link that supports high data rates
at multi-meter distances and wide view angles.
2. PixNet OVERVIEW
We present PixNet, a system for transmitting information
over LCD-camera links. In contrast to all past work on 2D
barcodes, which encode information directly in the visual do-
main, PixNet encodes information in the frequency domain.
Such a design is inspired by the popular OFDM transmission
scheme, widely used in modern RF technologies. However,
unlike existing RF-based OFDM schemes that encode data
in time frequencies, PixNet encodes data in two-dimensional
spatial frequencies. More importantly, PixNet generalizes
OFDM receiver algorithms to deal with the unique distor-
tions of the LCD-camera link. Using PixNet we show that
such a generalized frequency-based design provides a uniﬁed
framework to deal with the distortions in the LCD-camera
channel.
PixNet has the following three components:
(a) Perspective Correction Algorithm: A picture taken
by a digital camera is a sampled version of the captured ob-
ject. Perspective distortion occurs when the sampling fre-
quency is irregular. For example, a rectangular screen be-
comes a trapezoid if the columns on the right are sampled
at a lower frequency (i.e., with more pixels) than those on
the left (Fig. 1(a)). Since PixNet operates in the frequency
domain, it naturally addresses irregularity in the sampling
frequencies. We have generalized the OFDM receiver algo-
rithm to allow it to correct irregular sampling and hence
correct perspective distortion.
(b) Blur-Adaptive Coding: Approaches that encode
bits directly in the visual domain, like 2D barcodes, fail in
the presence of blur because the bits blend together.
In
contrast, since PixNet encodes information in the frequency
domain, it is more resilient to blur. Blur, in the frequency
domain, translates into attenuation in the high frequencies
while the low frequencies remain intact. Therefore, PixNet
naturally identiﬁes the frequencies aﬀected by blur and pre-
vents the error from spreading into other bits.
(c) Ambient Light Filter: Approaches that encode in-
formation directly in the visual domain have to perform a
special preprocessing step referred to as light balancing [4].
In contrast, PixNet operates in the frequency domain. Since
ambient light changes the overall luminance, it only aﬀects
the DC frequency. Thus, PixNet can ﬁlter out the impact
of ambient light simply by ignoring the DC frequency.
We have built a software prototype of PixNet and eval-

LCD screen (transmitter) and a camera (receiver)

uated it using commodity LCDs and cameras. Empirical
results show that PixNet delivers multiple Mb/s over multi-
meter distances and wide view angles. In comparison with
QR code, a state-of-the-art 2D code, PixNet delivers 2x to
9x higher throughput (depending on the distance and view
angle). For a complete description of PixNet see [6]
3. DEMO
Our demo will show how PixNet can be used to transfer
a video ﬁle over an LCD-Camera optical link. The video
ﬁle will be pre-coded as a sequence of frames that the LCD
screen will display in a continuous loop. As the LCD screen
renders these frames, the receiver will capture and decode
them. Fig. 2 shows a visual illustration of our setup.
To demonstrate PixNet’s robustness to visual distortions,
we will consider a few scenarios in our demo. To show the
impact of viewing angle, we will move the camera away from
its original center location (with respect to the LCD screen).
To demonstrate the eﬀect of blur on PixNet, we will defocus
the camera and show that PixNet can still decode the data
on the LCD.
We hope that our demo will generate signiﬁcant interest
and encourage the exploration of LCD-Camera pairs as a
future wireless communication technology.
