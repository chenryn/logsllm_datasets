make sense when latencies are often less than a single hy-
perperiod, but some queueing occurs. For example, the y-
values in pb and pr corresponding to Figure 6 are 109.71
and 237.71, which would notably improved the estimate
(making it less pessimistic). To eliminate dependencies on
the value of ρ2, one could use ρ2 = 1 − ρ1. Setting y0 to
the mid-point between L1 and L2 (for ﬁxed x0) may also be
reasonable (to prevent some y-value for pb from being 0).

[0, 384, 1024, 1152, 2048], ρ1 = 0.25 and ρ2 = 0.7. Block-
ing occurs only in the leftmost aperiodic transmission band.
When generating the ﬁnal set of binning points in Sec-
tion 5.2, the values of ρ2 in Equation 9 are essentially set
to 0 and 1 for each value of y0 associated with a busy/idle
transition instance. When the aperiodic message latencies
typically span multiple hyperperiods, a value of ρ2 = 1
works well for capturing confounding bands. Intuitively, a
transient value of ρ2 = 1 can be thought of as an aperiodic
message queue that will not signiﬁcantly decrease in size
over a single gap. We often found the set of binning points
described in Section 5.2 led to good estimates.
Including additional binning points at the y-values in pb
and pr (in each of the m aperiodic transmission bands) may

Figure 7. Bot: Non-Blocking RT Bands and
points pb, pr; Top: RT EDF (m = 2)
When system utilization ρ is low, most aperiodic mes-
sage arrivals will have a minimal wait. The right hand side
of Figure 5 shows aperiodic latency bands without block-
ing. Again, we compute values for pb and pr. Lines 1 and 2
(L1 and L2) are deﬁned by Equations 9 and 10. The slope
of L1 is sufﬁciently large that the intersecting point for L1

and L2 lies below the line y = 0. The x-coordinate for pb
is found by solving L1(x) = 0. It is easily checked that
L1(x0 +
y0
(1 − ρ2)
) = 0,
consequently pb = (x0 +
y0
(1 − ρ2) , 0).
(13)
Unlike when blocking occurs in an aperiodic transmission
band, once the aperiodic backlog is discharged it remains
in the discharged (aperiodic trafﬁc only) state until the next
periodic blocking band begins. When the periodic blocking
band with duration blocki+1 is encountered, the y-cordinate
jumps to the next aperiodic transmission band. So
pr = (x0 + y0 + gapi, blocki+1).
(14)
Note that the y-values deﬁned in pb (Equation 13) and pr
(Equation 14) are contained completely in the set of points
generated for our latency distribution generation algorithm.
Figure 7 shows data illustrating lines L1 and L2 for non-
blocking aperiodic latency bands and the corresponding la-
tency EDF. The periodic parameters are the same as in Fig-
ure 7 and λ = 0.05, so ρ = 0.30. When the hyperperiod is
suitably long (such as in Figure 7) the ﬂuid ﬂow discharge
behavior shown in Figure 5 accurately captures the system
behavior and can be used to explicitly compute the latency
distribution. In [3, 4], the latency CDF computation is ob-
tained from latency band graphs for some special cases.
6. Latency Estimation and Validation
Space restrictions permit
inclusion of only a small
amount of and display size for experimental data. We have
selected data from several dozen simulations that is rep-
resentative of a spectrum of operational settings. At one
end of the spectrum, the hyperperiods are very long rela-
tive to pending aperiodic work, and latencies are governed
largely by where the arrival occurred relative to local gaps
and blocks. At the other end of the spectrum, the cumulative
gap time available in any hyperperiod is small relative to the
pending aperiodic work, in which case latency distributions
are reasonably well approximated by the heavy trafﬁc mod-
els in [13] and by the reference model in Equation 6 for the
M/M/1 aperiodic queue simulation data.
6.1. Estimation at Binning Points
Assume a set of binning points S = (s1, s2, ..., sl) has
been collected. A compact latency vector of ﬁxed size is de-
ﬁned by R(S) = [p1, p2, ..., pl] where pi = P [latency ≤
si]. We use empirical data to estimate values for pi and
compare the results of our proposed binning techniques
with the traditional empirical distribution function estimate
and its associated conﬁdence bands. Latency band data
is placed near latency distribution data so the impacts of
band size, distribution and aperiodic utilization can be seen.
Samples are spaced far apart in time so the data set is ap-
proximately iid.

[0, 298 2
3 , 2048]. The
observed latencies all fall well within a single hyperperiod,
with the largest observed latency less than 400. Our bin-
ning technique produces a fairly accurate latency estimate.
There is a visible point of inﬂection at 298 2
3 . The DSM is
optimistic compared to our latency estimate. When trafﬁc
is heavy, the DSM approximates the M/M/1 HTM, which
is pessimistic compared to the U/U/1 HTM. Since the hy-
perperiod H = 2048 is long, ρ = 0.99 does not induce
heavy trafﬁc conditions, hence the U/U/1 HTM would sig-
niﬁcantly underestimate observed latencies.
