User: How can I check and resolve high disk usage on my server?
Assistant: Here are the steps to check and resolve high disk usage on your server: 1. Check disk space usage: Use the command `df -h` to check disk space usage and find out which files or directories are taking up a lot of disk space . 2. Regularly clean up log files: Log files should be cleaned up regularly to avoid taking up too much disk space. Log files can be automatically cleaned using tools such as `logrotate`. 3. Check databases and applications: Databases and applications should be checked for issues with storing too much data. For databases, cleanup scripts can be executed to delete unnecessary data from storage. For applications, you can check for unnecessary cache files or log files. 4. Delete unnecessary files: Unnecessary files or directories should be deleted in time. You can use the `rm` command to delete specified files or directories, or use the `find` command to find and delete outdated files. 5. Compress large files: For files that occupy a large disk space, you can use `gzip`, `bzip2` and other tools to compress to reduce disk space usage. 6. Expand the disk capacity: If the above methods cannot solve the problem, you can consider expanding the disk capacity to meet more storage needs.
