of the telescope are less than a given timeout interval.5 In this work,
we choose n = 100, since we introduce metrics in the following
sections that require a certain number of packets to yield distinctive
results, and we found 100 destination IPs to be a good compromise
between capturing small-scale scans, as well as providing enough
packets for characterizing individual scans. Having n fixed, we next
need to decide on a timeout threshold.
Timeout settings: Figure 5 shows the number of identified scans
in our dataset (blue dotted line), as well as the fraction of total
packets that are captured within scans (red line) for alternative
values of the timeout threshold. A larger timeout value necessarily
aggregates a larger number of packets into scans, hence the mono-
tonic increase of packets that we classify to belong to scans (red
line). Overall, we note that a timeout value of 300 seconds already
groups more than 80% of all packets into scans and that increasing
the timeout value has only a comparably small effect on the fraction
of packets considered as scans. The relationship between timeout
value and number of scans (blue dotted line) is determined by two
phenomena: A larger timeout value aggregates individual scans
together, resulting in a decreasing number of individual scans. At
the same time, since we require at least 100 packets in a scan, a
larger timeout value yields more scans from source IPs that send
packets at an overall low rate, i.e., they would not be considered a
scan for shorter timeout values. We see the number of scan events
decreasing rather rapidly for aggregation values between 300s and
3600s (one hour) and note a slight increase in identified scans at
5400 seconds (1.5 hours). We note that this value is dependent on
our choice of n = 100 destination IPs, and not a natural property
of the dataset. In the following, we choose 5400 seconds as our
timeout threshold, as a reasonable compromise in obtaining both a
high number of scans and a high fraction of probes classified into
scans.
Detectable scanning rate: To put this 5400 second timeout in
perspective; suppose a source is scanning the “full” IPv4 space in
random order. If the source sends probes slowly, then our telescope
has less of a chance of detecting this activity as a scan. Assuming a
full scan means all IPv4 ranges that are publicly routable, which is
3.7 billion addresses, and given our telescope of 178K addresses (and
some simplifying assumptions), then, if the source sends probes at
30 packets per second, then the telescope will classify the activity
as a scan with probability 0.95; if 50 pps, then the probability is
0.9998. Durumeric et al. [18] found that 95% of scans they detected
were conducted at rates of at least 100 pps, making us confident that
our timeout settings capture a large majority of scanning activity,
when assuming random scanning order.
Total identified scans: In total, we identified 2.2M scans, and
which contain 87% of all logged traffic in our dataset. We note that
less than 1% of packets classified belonging to scans were logged
when the token bank was in the burst state, § 3.2. Seen on a per-scan
basis, 71% of scans had 0 packets as part of bursts, 98% of scans had
less than 1% of their packets received in burst state, and 99.7% of

calculate for each source IP address the ratio of number of pack-
ets sent to telescope addresses that are client-facing IPs divided
by the total number of packets from that source address. Figure 4
shows, for each of our 6 partitions of source IP addresses, a CDF
of this ratio. Source IP addresses that target only a small number
of machines almost exclusively direct traffic at the client-facing
IPs, the two left-hand tiles. Furthermore, in the top left-hand tile,
where a comparatively large fraction of packets were logged when
the token-bank was in the burst state (recall § 4.1), some of the
sources are likely involved in Denial-of-Service attacks, nominally
directed against a customer of the CDN, i.e., attacks targeted at a
domain name. Sources that target a large number of the telescope
addresses, the two right-hand tiles, are exclusively CDN-agnostic:
The traffic is balanced across client-facing and operations IP ad-
dresses. The middle, top tile is an intriguing mixture of the left and
righthand tiles: the sources, which hit a subset of machines and
with many packets per IP address, are evenly divided into CDN-
targeted and CDN-agnostic source behavior. Within this middle tile,
CDN-agnostic sources typically hit more destination IPs than the
CDN-targeted sources. In particular, for sources in this tile that hit
more than 1, 000 telescope IPs, more than 92% show CDN-agnostic
behavior. We will further scrutinize the behavior of these addresses
in Section 5.
Share of CDN-targeted traffic: Source IPs that send at least 99%
of their packets to client-facing IPs account for some 9.9% of the
overall logged traffic, and comprise some 64% of all source IP ad-
dresses seen. This traffic was attracted to our telescope solely due to
the telescope containing addresses that are the A record in replies
to forward DNS requests. Given that most packets logged during
burst state are targeted at client-facing IP addresses, we point out
that the actual share of this CDN-targeted traffic is likely much
higher, but is not logged due to the token-bucket sampling. In terms
of our overall dataset, however, we note than some 90% of logged
traffic is CDN-agnostic, i.e., not targeted at the CDN’s customers.
4.3 Identifying Scans
So far, we considered all packets sent by a source throughout our
observation period, November 2018. Next, we seek to isolate indi-
vidual scan events.

scans had less than 10% of their packets received in a burst state. We
are thus confident that we do not falsely identify attacks targeted
at the CDN machines as scans. In the remainder of this paper, we
focus on traffic identified as scans, unless otherwise noted.
5 SCAN TARGET SELECTION STRATEGIES
In this section, we introduce tools and analysis to classify individual
scans into different target selection categories. The results of our
classification are shown in Table 2.
5.1 Internet-wide full IPv4 Scans
The first, and most straight-forward to detect, target selection strat-
egy are full scans of the IPv4 address space. Recent advancements
in scanning tools make scanning of the full space possible, even
within hours. We detect full scans by checking if a scan targeted
at least 150K of the 178K telescope addresses. This includes both
client-facing and operations IP addresses. Here, we leave some lee-
way to account for both packet loss, network-specific filtering [9],
as well as for servers that might be in a maintenance mode, such
as for a system software update. In our dataset, we find a total of
2.8K full scans, originating from 1.3K source IP addresses. While
this number is comparably small, we highlight that full scans of the
IPv4 space account for more than 27% of all the scanning traffic.
5.2 CDN-targeted Scans (Domain Scans)
The second target selection category are scans that exclusively or
primarily target the client-facing IP addresses of the CDN. While
we find that the vast majority of scans are equally distributed across
client-facing and operations IP addresses, we do find some 1.9% of
scans, where the fraction of probes to the client-facing IP is close
to 1. Since only the client-facing IP is returned on forward DNS
lookups (and never the operations IP), these scans are likely the
result of hosts scanning domain names (e.g., a host resolving the
Alexa top list) We call such scans CDN-targeted, or domain scans.
Note that since the DNS resolution of a given domain name
will change over time, and different domain names have different
resolutions, scans of a large number of domains can and will result
in the CDN resolving requests to different servers, which results
in sources hitting different destination IPs. Also, a large number of
client-facing addresses could be gathered by scanners that resolve
domain names from different locations. Thus, it is reasonable from
such activity to reach the threshold of 100 telescope IPs. We set our
threshold for a scan to be CDN-targeted if the client-facing-to-total
traffic ratio exceeds 0.8,6 and identify some 40.6K CDN-targeted
scans from some 19.7K IP addresses.
6As per Figure 4, we note that the client-facing-to-total ratio is either very close to 0.5
or very close to 0.1. Our threshold of 0.8 for classification thus works well.
(a) Internet-wide partial scan: 148 packets total, Pearson r = 0.96.
(b) Localized scan: 827 packets total, Pearson r = 0.38.
Figure 6: Determining if scans target a random set of destina-
tions: We correlate the fraction of telescope addresses per /8
(positive y-axis) against the fraction of packets received per
source per /8 (negative y-axis). Internet-wide full or partial
scans of the IPv4 space result in a high correlation.
5.3 Internet-wide partial Scans
As a complement to full scans, partial scans are scans that probe
fewer than 150K telescope addresses. And, with CDN-targeted scans
in their own target-selection category, we partition the remaining
CDN-agnostic partial scans into two other categories: Internet-wide
partial scans and localized scans, based on whether they are, or are
not, consistent with being a randomly selected subset of addresses
of the full IPv4 address space.
Dissecting Internet-wide from localized scans: To distinguish
Internet-wide from localized scanning strategies, we leverage the
insight that an Internet-wide scan targeting a random subset of the
IPv4 space will, necessarily, also hit a random subset of individual
server IP addresses of our telescope. We first partition our CDN
server addresses into /8 bins, and compute the fraction of addresses
in each bin. Then we assess—for each scan—how well the distribu-
tion of scan packets over /8 bins correlates with the distribution
of our server addresses. Figure 6 shows this by example. Here, the
source IP in Figure 6a sends 148 packets, and the distribution of
these packets across /8 bins correlates well with the distribution of
the telescope IPs resulting in a high Pearson correlation of r = 0.96.
In contrast, the source IP in Figure 6b sends some 827 packets in
a scan, and most of these packets are destined to machines in two
/8s (see red negative spikes). The correlation for this scan is much
lower at r = 0.38. This destination pattern is caused by selecting a
non-random subset of the IPv4 space.
Figure 7a shows the histogram of Pearson correlation, r, for all
partial scans in our dataset (blue bars). We see that the distribution
of correlations is strictly bi-modal: Either scans have a high cor-
relation, close to 1, or a very low one. To show the validity of our
correlation-based approach and to find a sensible cutoff point, we
simulated 1000 iterations of an Internet-wide scan targeting 100
randomly chosen destination IPs (red bars). We chose 100, since

as localized, since the visibility of these scan is dependent on the
position of the vantage point in the IPv4 address space. We note
that the classification of a scan as localized, per our definition, does
not necessarily imply that the scanner targets a tightly confined
region of the address space, but only that the scanner does not
target a random subset of the IPv4 space.
To assess the scope of the address space that is targeted by
different localized scans, we show in Figure 7b the number of routed
BGP prefixes (as well as ASes) that individual scans hit, contrasting
Internet-wide partial scans against localized scans. Here, we can
see that visibility of localized scans is often confined to particular
regions of the address space. Some 34% of these scans target at most
10 routed prefixes, and only 20% hit more than 100 routed prefixes.
This is in stark contrast to partial Internet-wide scans (dashed lines),
where over 90% hit more than 100 routed prefixes (recall that our
telescope is distributed across some 2,800 routed prefixes). We also
aggregated scans by the number of unique ASes hit (i.e., hitting any
routed prefix originated by an AS), and which show a slightly higher
concentration when compared to routed prefixes (some 42% of scans
hit 10 or less ASes). We also tried simple covering prefixes (/16 and
/8 prefixes, not shown) as alternative viewpoints of spatial target
locality of scans, but found them to not yield better aggregation
results as compared to BGP routed prefix and AS aggregation. We
find that many localized scans share the commonality of targeting
narrow ranges in the address space, and we will further study the
properties of these scans in the following sections.
In total, we identify some 693K localized scans, contributing
some 29% to all scan traffic, originated from some 332K source IP
