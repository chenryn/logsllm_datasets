User: Is there a way to make PyEphem give times in Dynamical Time (Terrestrial Time), without using delta_t() every time?
According to documentations, PyEphem uses Ephemeris Time. So isn't there a way to just 'switch off' the conversion to UTC?
Assistant: Alas â€” I am not aware of any settings in the libastro library, the PyEphem is based on, that would allow the use of alternative time scales.
