I have a CGI script, `index.cgi`, which I placed in the `wiki/` directory and configured Apache to invoke it when I access `http://localhost/wiki`. However, I am encountering issues while using this application. The script generates links such as `http://localhost/wiki/@edit/index`, but when I click on one of these links, Apache attempts to serve `wiki/@edit/index` as a file instead of passing the request to `index.cgi`.

I suspect that I need to configure Apache to pass the `/@edit/index` path to `index.cgi`. Specifically, the script is looking for strings like `@edit` in the `REQUEST_URI` environment variable.

**Solution:**

I identified the issue and found that it can be resolved using the `RewriteEngine`. The Pwyky application includes an `.htaccess` file in the `wiki/` directory with the necessary rewrite rules. However, by default, the `AllowOverride` directive is set to `None` on macOS, which causes Apache to ignore the settings in the `.htaccess` file.

To fix this, you need to change the `AllowOverride` directive to `All` in your Apache configuration. This will allow the rewrite rules specified in the `.htaccess` file to take effect.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Open your Apache configuration file, typically located at `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf` or `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`.
2. Find the `<Directory>` block that corresponds to the `wiki/` directory. It might look something like this:
   ```apache
   <Directory "/path/to/your/wiki">
       AllowOverride None
       # other directives
   </Directory>
   ```
3. Change the `AllowOverride` directive from `None` to `All`:
   ```apache
   <Directory "/path/to/your/wiki">
       AllowOverride All
       # other directives
   </Directory>
   ```
4. Save the changes and restart Apache to apply the new configuration:
   ```sh
   sudo apachectl restart
   ```

After making these changes, Apache should correctly pass the `/@edit/index` path to `index.cgi`, and the application should work as expected.
