User: I have a CGI script (pwyky) that I called index.cgi, put in directory wiki/, and setup Apache to call localhost/wiki/index.cgi when I access localhost/wiki.
I'm getting errors when I'm trying to use this application -- it creates a page with links like "http://localhost/wiki/@edit/index", but when I click that link, Apace is trying to serve "wiki/@edit/index" as a file. I suspect that I need to get Apache to pass /@edit/index into index.cgi.
In particular, looking through index.cgi, its looking for strings like "@edit" in REQUEST_URI environment variable.
Any idea how to fix this?
Assistant: I found the problem, it turned out this is done through RewriteEngine. Pwyky puts .htaccess file in the directory with all the settings for RewriteEngine, but because AllowOverride is "None" by default on MacOS, they were ignored. The solution was to change all "AllowOverride" directives to "All"
