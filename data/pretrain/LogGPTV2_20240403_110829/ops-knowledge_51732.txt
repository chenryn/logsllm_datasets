User: In the field of network security, what types of attacks and security defense strategies are there?
Assistant: Attack types: 1. Denial of service attack (DoS/DDoS): By consuming the resources of the target system, it cannot work normally. 2. Trojan horse virus: By implanting a Trojan horse program into the target system, malicious behaviors such as remote control and information theft are realized. 3. Phishing: tricking users into disclosing passwords and other sensitive information by counterfeiting legitimate websites or sending phishing emails. 4. Penetration attack: Obtain sensitive information or control rights of the target system by cracking passwords and exploiting vulnerabilities. Security defense strategy: 1. Security awareness training: Strengthen user security awareness, pay attention to password security and prevent phishing attacks, etc. 2. System reinforcement: Improve system security by adding access control, upgrading patches, closing unnecessary services, etc. 3. Traffic filtering: Filter traffic and detect and block attacks through devices such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). 4. Security monitoring: Through log auditing, security incident management and other means, timely discover and respond to security incidents. 5. Emergency response: establish a sound emergency response plan, deal with security incidents in a timely manner, and reduce security risks.
