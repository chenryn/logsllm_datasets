that underlies this approach is not new. However, up until now, communications
channels of this type have been thought of as a serious security vulnerability,
certainly not purposely optimised and used to achieve legitimate protocol goals.
So in this sense, the proposal is to the best of our knowledge, novel. The following
sections describe the technique in the context of ISO 14443 contactless smart
cards, though it is worth noting that it is also applicable to contact smart cards
and a range of other devices that are also vulnerable to relay attacks (e.g. see
[10] for a description of relay attacks on contact smart cards).
The proposed communication technique exploits the principle of simple side-
channel analysis (SSCA) to disclose the response bit to the veriﬁer in the time
critical phase. SSCA is based on the following observation: computation in a
microprocessor is the result of the physical process of electrons moving through
semiconductor gates. This physical process takes a ﬁnite amount of time and
consumes a measurable amount of energy which is radiated as heat and electro-
magnetic emanations. Such measurable phenomena are known as side channel
leakage. Careful analysis of these phenomena can reveal detailed information
about the internal state of the device [16].
The key advantage of communicating through side channel leakage is the
dramatic reduction in latency - the veriﬁer can detect the response bit as the
prover calculates it, eﬀectively being able to watch the prover in real time as
11
it ‘thinks’. This eliminates the variable delays that would be introduced if the
response bit had to traverse a layered communications stack before the veriﬁer
received it. While both power and EM side channels are possible candidates,
power has advantages in implementation simplicity. Since the veriﬁer provides
the card’s power it is ideally placed to precisely monitor it.
What modiﬁcations are required to implement a usable power communica-
tion side channel? The card needs to implement a special XOR instruction that
is designed to have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent power consumption characteristics, de-
pending on the value of the output bit. This can be achieved by having the
instruction conditionally switch a resistor into the supply circuit only if the re-
sult is for example, binary one. Normally, simple side channel analysis requires
a digital oscilloscope with a reasonably high sampling frequency to analyse the
power consumption since the data dependent behaviour is subtle. This is not nec-
essary with the proposed method because the special XOR instruction can be
implemented in such a way that it produces a deliberately large power consump-
tion spike that can be detected with a simple peak detector circuit in the reader.
Moreover, within the time critical phase, spikes of this magnitude would only
be produced by the special instruction. The signaling load should be condition-
ally switched, ideally in the same clock cycle that the XOR result is calculated.
The essence of the proposal is that the switching should be as integral to the
instruction as the calculation itself. The circuitry required to implement this
instruction and the corresponding peak detector circuit can be implemented at
modest cost.
4.3 Communication latency and distance bounding resolution
Realistic attack scenarios on contactless smart cards may involve relay distances
as small as a few meters since legitimate cards are often found in the close
vicinity of a card reader. The propagation delay for this distance is of the order
of 10-20 ns, so at ﬁrst glance it would appear that a useful distance bounding
protocol would need to detect delays of 10-20 ns. This is a technically demanding
requirement. ISO 14443 contactless smart cards support a base communication
rate of 106 kbits/s. At this bit rate a signal propagates 2.8 km in one bit period.
Hancke [12] argues that this bit rate is inadequate for distance bounding and
that contactless smart cards require Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radio to achieve
the necessary distance resolution to detect such short range attacks. Since the
addition of UWB radio to smart card integrated circuits would add appreciable
cost and complexity to a very cost sensitive product, it is worth examining
whether short range attacks can be detected using existing technology, applied
according to our proposed side channel leakage communication model.
ISO 14443 contactless smart cards communicate with the reader via load
modulation. A resistor in the card’s power supply circuit is switched in and
out of circuit in time with the data to be transmitted. When the resistor is
switched in, the card consumes more power and this increased consumption can
be sensed as an amplitude change (as measured in the reader’s antenna circuit)
in the 13.56 MHz carrier (fc). For Type A cards, the data is baseband encoded
12

using Manchester binary coding and this baseband signal is modulated on a 847
kHz subcarrier using amplitude shift keying (ASK). This modulated subcarrier
signal is used to turn the load resistor on and oﬀ to modulate fc (see Figure 2).
Subcarrier modulation is used instead of direct baseband data modulation on
fc because of associated beneﬁts with the frequency spectrum it produces. The
subcarrier generates two sidebands that contain the coded data. The sidebands
appear 847 kHz either side of fc . Since they are a reasonable spectral distance
away from the main carrier frequency, a simple ﬁlter in the reader’s receive
circuit can be used to remove fc thereby isolating one of the sidebands. Sideband
modulation has better error performance in noisy environments at a cost of
reduced usable bandwidth and relatively poor power eﬃciency. However, it can
be implemented using inexpensive hardware. The comb like pattern of the carrier
signal, load modulated with the baseband modulated subcarrier can be seen in
the right hand side of Figure 3. It takes 128 carrier cycles (9.4 µs) to modulate
a single bit.
Hancke notes that the distance resolution of a channel of bandwidth B is
‘roughly’ equal to c/B where c is the speed of light. According to this formula,
the distance resolution is the propagation distance in one bit period. To clarify
some of the roughness, we will examine this further: the distance resolution is
actually a function of the timing resolution - the veriﬁer stops the clock when
the bit is received. But distance bounding protocols only need to exchange a
single bit so the timing resolution is determined by whether the prover can start
modulating the bit at an arbitrary point in time4. To make this distinction
4 In the discussion that follows we assume that the prover’s distance bounding logic
has direct access to the physical layer to modulate its response as a single bit. This
cannot be done within the existing ISO 14443 standard. Furthermore, ISO 14443
requires a card to begin modulating its response only after a deﬁned frame delay
time (FDT) has elapsed. This means that the ﬁrst response bit has to be aligned to
a bit grid deﬁned by the FDT. In examining the principles of timing resolution, we
ignore this restriction in ISO 14443.
13
more concrete, recall that the bit period of for ISO 14443 cards is 128 carrier
cycles - which equates to a propagation distance of 2.8 km. However, because the
prover is responding with a single bit sent on on a clear channel, she does not
need to wait for some bandwidth determined bit boundary to be able to start
modulating. At the instant the response is calculated the prover has the ability
to start producing a modulation peak on the main 13.56 MHz carrier. Once
chosen, the starting modulation cycle eﬀectively determines the ending cycle
which ﬁxes when the veriﬁer stops the timer. From the veriﬁer’s perspective, the
response bit can start arriving on any cycle of the carrier. With some important
qualiﬁcations which we will soon discuss, the timing resolution is closer to 1/fc
(74 ns or 22 m propagation). For ISO 14443 cards, this is a signiﬁcantly ﬁner
resolution than the bit period alone would indicate. We will soon see that this
can be improved even further if subcarrier modulation is not used.
Unfortunately, for more subtle reasons, this does not mean that usable tim-
ing resolution is purely a function of fc and independent of the bit rate. To
understand why this is so, we need to consider how a malicious adversary might
manipulate a modulation scheme to their advantage to avoid detection of a relay
attack. If a contactless smart card system is protected by a timing-based dis-
tance bounding protocol and an attacker wants to launch a relay attack against
it in the style of Hancke [11] or Kﬁr [15], to be successful the attacker needs
to absorb the delay that is introduced by the relay so that the round trip time
falls in the range that the veriﬁer will accept. If the bit period is suﬃciently
long, the attacker can begin modulating a guess of the response bit to the real
veriﬁer (reader) at the expected time via the rogue prover ¯A. If the delay in-
troduced by the relay devices is not too great, then at some point part way
through the modulation of the guessed bit the attacker will learn (via the rogue
veriﬁer ¯B which relays the signals) the correct value by monitoring the response
of the real card. If the guess is wrong, the part-modulated bit can be switched
to the correct modulation pattern. If this switch occurs suﬃciently early in the
bit period, the inconsistency will be interpreted as noise and the new value will
be accepted. This is possible because of the high degree of redundancy in the
subcarrier modulation method. This redundancy also means that the attacker
can read the card’s response bit well before the end of the bit period by directly
monitoring the amplitude modulation on fc rather than accessing the data via
processing a side band. To avoid this, we need to adopt a modulation scheme
that is not susceptible to having a modulated bit changed part way through the
bit period. The most eﬀective way to do this is to reduce the number of carrier
cycles that represent a bit period. This increases the channel bandwidth but also
the susceptibility to bit errors through channel noise.
We have already noted that the timing resolution for a modulated channel
is potentially 1/fc and that for ISO 14443 cards at 13.56 MHz, this represents a
timing resolution of 74 ns. The qualiﬁcation is necessary because the resolution
depends on how quickly the card can increase the load on the reader’s antenna
circuit to produce a detectable carrier amplitude change. This depends on the
quality of the inductive coupling between the card and reader antenna loops.
14
The coupling quality degrades as the distance increases and it takes more cy-
cles to produce a detectable modulation change, since the card can only apply
a slowly increasing load. We have determined through experimental observation
(see Section 5) that at closer distances, a card can produce a detectable modu-
lation peak within a half cycle. This means that the timing resolution can be as
low as 1/2fc or 37 ns, the period between successive carrier peaks.
Rogue relay devices introduce detectable delays We have noted that
the propagation delay for short range relay attacks is of the order of 10-20 ns.
So at ﬁrst glance it would appear that even in the best case (37 ns), a 13.56
MHz carrier will not be able to provide the required timing resolution. However,
this overlooks a crucial observation - relay attacks introduce unavoidable delays
beyond the time it takes the signal to propagate through the air. The rogue relay
devices themselves each incur a circuit propagation delay known as group delay
or envelope delay - the amount of time that the amplitude modulated signal is
delayed by its passage through a device [14]. For example, Hancke’s relay attack
introduces a total delay of 15-20 µs for a relay distance of only 50 m. A signal
could propagate over a 6 km round trip in this time. Given that the actual
distance is 50 m, the delay contribution of the relay devices is clearly signiﬁcant.
Hancke’s attack was a proof of concept that used inexpensive RF relay equipment
with a high group delay of approximately 4 µs. Microwave transceivers operating
at gigahertz frequencies can have group delay in the order of tens of nanoseconds
[2]. This type of equipment is typically found in signals intelligence applications
and is both expensive and exotic5. Less costly equipment will have a signiﬁcantly
higher group delay and will therefore be easier to detect.
The key reason why it may not be necessary to resort to UWB radio as
Hancke has suggested [12] is due to the unavoidable group delay introduced by
the relay devices. The relayed signal needs to pass through ¯A and ¯B in two direc-
tions so the group (circuit) delay of the relay devices introduces approximately
40 ns of cumulative delay. Because of this, we argue that a distance bounding
protocol only needs to be able to detect an introduced delay of approximately
50 ns to still be able to detect highly sophisticated short range relay attacks by
well funded attackers. With some limitations, this is achievable using amplitude
modulation of a 13.56MHz carrier because positive or negative carrier peaks oc-
cur every 37ns. The introduced delay is detectable because it is greater than the
period between carrier peaks.
In summary, the ISO 14443 card to reader modulation scheme is inappro-
priate for the time critical phase of a distance bounding protocol, not simply
because of its low bit rate but because the large number of carrier cycles per bit
makes it easy for an attacker to manipulate - by guessing the response bit and
changing the modulation pattern part way through the bit period if the guess
turns out to be wrong. Introduced relay delays for short range attacks (which

are the most diﬃcult to detect) can be absorbed in this way. To address this
shortcoming without resorting to the signiﬁcant expense of implementing UWB
radio in the smart card we propose the following modiﬁcations: to replace the
subcarrier method of communication in the time critical phase with a simple
peak detection approach on the main carrier. When the XOR response to the
challenge is logical one, the card’s load resistor is switched into circuit (via a
special XOR instruction) and this produces an amplitude change in the reader
antenna circuit. If the result is zero, the resistor is not switched and there is
no change. Whilst being susceptible to noise errors, (which can be accommo-
dated by adjusting the number of rounds), this scheme has very low latency and
minimises the attacker’s ability to guess and subsequently change the bit they
are modulating. The card should implement the protocol in such a way that it
calculates its response in the smallest possible ﬁxed number of carrier cycles.
The veriﬁer will know how many cycles the card requires, allowing it to sample
the amplitude of the carrier in a window starting at at the nominated cycle, to
detect zero or one by the absence or presence of a peak. If the genuine card’s
responses are being communicated via a relay the introduced delay will push
the modulation peak onto a later cycle. Note that side channel defense measures
(active power consumption ﬁlters, random delay cycles etc.) would need to be
disabled during the time critical phase. To protect the long term key, the card
must introduce its own randomness into the bits that are XORed with the key.
5 Investigations into modulation latency
We hypothesized that a contactless smart card could alter its power consumption
using existing load modulation circuitry to communicate in our proposed style of
side channel leakage, with suﬃciently low latency to detect sophisticated short
range relay attacks by well funded attackers. To test the latency aspect of this
hypothesis6 we investigated the rate of change in carrier amplitude that a card
could eﬀect via load modulation, as detected in the receive circuit of the reader.
As we have previously noted, the rate of change determines the eﬀective timing
resolution.
5.1 Experimental setup and rationale
We used a Philips Mifare Pegoda development kit reader which conforms to the
ISO 14443 type A standard. A digital oscilloscope with a 200 MHz sampling rate
was directly attached to the receive circuit of the reader’s antenna. We captured
