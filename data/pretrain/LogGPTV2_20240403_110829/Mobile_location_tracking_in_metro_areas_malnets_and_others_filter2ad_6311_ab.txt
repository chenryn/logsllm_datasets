emanated. However, this is frequently approximated by us-
ing a sphere of a given radius. We considered a number of
radii from 15m to 45m to represent lower and upper-bounds
on 802.11g wireless transmissions. Additionally, 45m rep-
resents a conservative lower-bound for 802.11n. In order to
signiﬁcantly speed up the calculation of proximity detection,
and since the sphere is already an approximation, we detect
locations within the tightest bounding cubes of the corre-
sponding sphere. See Fig. 1 for a 2-D visualization of this

in Step 6 we use trilateration to narrow down its location.
Speciﬁcally, we determine the area of overlaps from all of
the detecting locators.
Population Density and Simulations.
We derived the number of people for our simulation areas
by using LandScan [2] data to derive an accurate estimate
for the census population of the area. In particular, we sim-
ulate a 9 block region of Chicago with 9056 people, and a 16
block region of Dallas with 2988. This was included in our
simulator as the maximum population for the given areas at
any time of day. We see that the actual populations simu-
lated during the day are often below that (e.g., our 7:30am
simulations average 42% of that population in Chicago, with
11:00am having 90% of the population). The lower density
earlier in the day can also be explained by the fact most sim-
ulated agents do not start in the simulated area but travel
into and out of the area throughout the day. We suspect,
although could ﬁnd no data, that the census populated data
(of 9056 and 2988) is a conservative estimate on the pop-
ulation of both areas, as they are both relatively absent of
housing, and mostly businesses. Thus the census maximums
probably correspond to evening maximums, and during the
busy periods of the day when the workforce arrives the pop-
ulation presumably grows. Thus we believe our simulations
are conservative.
3D vs. 2D.
The experiments are performed in three dimensions, with
people going up and down buildings, working in oﬃces on
speciﬁc ﬂoors, etc... One might be tempted to assume that
all individuals are on a plane, and perform the simulations

We note that using both ray-tracing or radio-mapping to
get a more realistic simulation of wireless propagation is
inconceivable due to the computational eﬀort required.

periments in two-dimensions, for comparison purposes, and
results are substantially improved in these models. There-
fore, it is more cautious and realistic to maintain three di-
mensional results. All simulation results stated in this paper
are for three-dimensional simulations.
Mobile vs. stationary devices.
We consider only mobile device detectors. This focus is
for two reasons:
i) we could ﬁnd no dataset of wireless
routers that contained altitude coordinates, and as stated
we need three dimensional simulations; and ii) in the case
of 2D data, preliminary 2D-simulations using wardriving
placement datasets (e.g., the WiGLE war driving DB [5])
showed limited eﬀect of router surveillance with low detec-
tor rates. Manual inspection showed that this was due to the
sparse coverage, but inspection of the collected data leads
us to believe that it does not include most of the APs and
stationary WiFi devices that exists in the simulated area.
Given an accurate and full data set of all stationary devices
in the area, we believe that they would provide a far stronger
role in metropolitan geolocation. Nonetheless, the tracking
networks get robust results without the participation of APs
and other stationary devices.
Metropolis vs. Other Environments.
The results are speciﬁcally for dense metropolises. Our
results do not clearly generalize to sparser populations such
as suburban environments for several reasons. First, detec-
tion requires a certain amount of density, as targets need to
be in proximity to detectors. Second, detection of mobile
detectors and targets requires social aspects to be modeled.
The UDel simulator is designed only to emulate and match
statistics for metropolitan areas.
Pedestrians vs. Vehicles.
We only simulated pedestrians. We could not ﬁnd ﬁg-
ures that accurately represented the traﬃc densities in the
areas in question at a ﬁne grained time scale. These are
parameters that the UDel simulator needs to properly simu-
late vehicles. However, the addition of vehicles should only
increase the detection rates, as it would only add to the
number of potential observers.
The Usage of Phones.
While we can assume that devices in the tracking net-
work activate their WiFi radios whenever it is necessary,
the same cannot be said for those being tracked. A question
of key importance is how frequently people are actively using
their devices, and thus the WiFi radio is sending out probes.
Karlson et al. [32] studied the work habits of professionals
and their Windows Mobile smartphone habits. Their results
show that individuals used their smartphones to stay con-
nected to their work life throughout the day using email and
other applications on their windows mobile smart phones. In
terms of the rate of use, Karlson et al. showed that some
users have near ubiquitous use, while others intermittently,
but consistently, use their phones throughout the day. This
shows that individuals will be susceptible to being detected
frequently by a tracking network over a large range of their
travel. A report from ABI Research in 2009 [49] states that
74% of smartphone owners use their phone’s WiFi features.
Quantcast has stated iPhone is now the predominant device
for mobile Web consumption and has a 63.7% share of mo-
bile browser hits on websites [39]. Given the market share
of the iPhone, we can conclude that the use of extended
features of smartphones is increasing signiﬁcantly with the
improvements to networking and ease-of-use of the phones.
Our results should be interpreted as saying that individuals
can be tracked when their devices are active. The frequency
has some range amongst users. Note for tracking the device
does not need to be actively used (which Karlson et al. [32]
required), and so their results are a lower-bound.
4. RESULTS
We simulated scenarios in which the tracking network
comprises 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the
entire population in the designated areas of Chicago and
Dallas (as shown in Figs. 9 and 8 in App. ?? ). The 802.11g
standard has a maximum broadcast radius of ≈ 50m under
ideal circumstances. We considered simulations with broad-
cast radii of 15m, 30m, and 45m similar to [28]. We perform
simulations throughout the day to show the eﬀects of human
circadian activity.
In Fig.2, 10% of the population is actively tracking, and
the broadcast radii is15m (outer bounding box). This is a
large percentage of users for a malnet, but we believe rea-
sonable for an installed piece of software. We plot which
fraction of the tracked population can be observed with a
given frequency as time progresses through the day in both
Dallas and Chicago. Observe that the ability to track people
depends signiﬁcantly on the time of day, with low-points be-
ing when people are most dispersed during rush-hour entry
and exit from the workplace (recall, we simulate only pedes-
trians and not vehicles). Note that with 10% of the popula-
tion being detectors, they are always detectable. Thus 10%
is the minimal detection rate in Fig.2.
As can be seen, the 7-7:30am time period correspond to
a low-point in the detection rate, and therefore we will use
this time period as a conservative window upon which we
can modify alternate variables of the experiments.
Frequency of Detection.
It is evident that to eﬀectively track an individual one
does not require 100% detection rates over time, but in-
stead a tracker is presumably content to position someone
a signiﬁcant fraction of the time, and interpolate the posi-
tion between observations. We calculated the average dura-
tion tracked individuals went without detection, assuming
diﬀerent rates of observation. Fig. 3 shows the tracked
users’ mean undetected walk duration for our experiment in
Chicago from 7-7:30am, with a 15, 30, and 45m detection
radius. We consider only the individuals who were detected
greater than or equal to 10% of the time. The standard
deviations for mean undetected times (not shown in the ﬁg-
ure for clarity) range in the worst case from 3.23 seconds at
15m to 2.92 at 45m. Thus for a 3σ deviation, an individual
will go undetected for at most 18 seconds with 10% of the
population as detectors. This number also improves as we
increase the size of the tracking network. When considering
the whole population, we have a sparser set of detections
with higher means and standard deviations. In this sparse
case, low percentages might provide scattered detections,
but the low entropy of human movements and the walking
speed of individuals (recall, only pedestrians are simulated)

tions are aggregated over time [48].
Comparison of Dallas to Chicago.
We performed the simulations on regions of two cities,
Dallas and Chicago, as they have diﬀerent properties of
density and building use. For example, the height of the
diﬀerent buildings in Chicago is more uniform whereas Dal-
las has some exceedingly high buildings surrounded by rel-
atively short ones. Both have 22 buildings and an average
height again of 27 stories (minus rounding error). Similarly,
the distribution of buildings dedicated to housing vs. indus-
try and commerce changes. The result is quite immediate.
Although the number of people in Dallas is about a third of
Chicago and the area simulated greater, the rates of detec-
tion are only about half that of Chicago. Due to the diﬀerent
make-up of the Dallas area, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in detections at the beginning and end of the day as com-
pared to Chicago. We conclude that the detection rate can
be quite sensitive to the geometry and purpose of the build-
ings. The appendix has a map of the areas simulated in both
cities, and denotes the use of buildings and the number of
ﬂoors.
Density of Populations.
In Fig. 4 we see that as the number of individuals in-
creases in an area as the fraction of the population in the
tracking network remains constant, the ability to track the
non-participants also increases. This is expected. The sen-
sors are increasing coverage in a ﬁnite area, as there are
more detectors, and increasing potential trackees, as there
are more people. However, due to the clustering behavior
of humans, the increase is not as pronounced as might be
expected, as the increase in detectors can result in the same
area being covered multiple times. However, this does lead
to more accurate trilateration.
The Effect of Network Prevalence on Detection.
As the tracking network comprises a larger percentage of
the population, detection rates go up. In Fig.5, we simulate
from 7-7:30am using a 15m and 30m broadcast radius to
provide an upper and lower bound for 802.11g performance.
The simulation is done in Chicago. We observe the eﬀect
on the percentage of individuals that can be tracked a given
frequency of the time. We see that rates as low as 10%
are suﬃcient to begin tracking people’s whereabouts signif-
icant fractions of the time. For example, we see that 41%
of the population can be positioned to within 15m during
50% of the time steps up to 65% at 30m. While 10% of
the population dedicated to the tracking network may seem
high, this percentage of detectors should be feasible if the
tracking software came bundled with a popular smartphone
application.
The Effect of Broadcast Diameter.
In Fig. 6, we simulate over the same 7-7:30am period
with the tracking network now only comprising a conserva-
tive 1% of the individuals. We now consider the eﬀect of
extending the broadcasting range from 15m to 45m. We see
a signiﬁcant increase in tracking rates for range increases
that are well within conservative limits for 802.11n radios.
Also, the diﬀerence in performance between the inner and
outer detection squares is minor compared to the increase in
broadcast radius. The maximal indoor range of 802.11n con-
nections is often quoted as 90m, so a conservative estimate
of a 45m broadcast range for detecting frames is, in our opin-
ion, still reasonable, if not conservative. With 802.11g, 30m
and 45m can be considered maximum ranges under optimal
conditions thus providing a low, mid, and high boundary for
