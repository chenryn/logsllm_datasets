input port mapping for spoof protection, and 2) tagID to output port
mapping for tag-based forwarding. These two lookups results in
≈12% drop in throughput compared to line rates, and ≈6.6% drop
in throughput with 9000-byte packet sizes. Next, the flow-based
connection tracking, where we store a 6-tuple (i.e., source and des-
tination IPs and port, transport protocol, and flags) for tracking and
filtering the traffic is compared with tag-based connection tracking.
We find that tag-based connection tracking exhibits a throughput
improvement of ≈2 – 10% over flow-based connection tracking.
Finally, when compared to stateless ACL-based filtering, tag-based
connection tracking shows ≈1.5 – 4.0% improvement in throughput.

Our work is informed by prior research on rule-based and graph-
based policy frameworks. One weakness of existing SDN-based
policy frameworks [2, 19, 21, 26, 36, 42] is that they lack the ability
to directly capture the fine-grained & sensitive dataflow-based

A.2 Security Use Cases
To illustrate the ability of CoordiNetZ to support a range of security
policies involving data with varying sensitivities, we present the
following use cases: (i) preventing DTN hosts from tag spoofing
flows in order to bypass SDN-enforced flow controls, (ii) preventing
malicious exfiltration of sensitive data, (iii) demonstrating improved
