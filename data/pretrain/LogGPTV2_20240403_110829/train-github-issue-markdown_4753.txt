When dragging and dropping a Firefox tab across screens, Atom (version 0.190.0) unexpectedly exits. This issue occurs on Ubuntu 14.04 with Firefox 37.0.1. Below is the console log for further analysis:

```
[23715:0414/125813:ERROR:browser_main_loop.cc(170)] Running without the SUID sandbox! For more information on developing with the sandbox enabled, see: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSUIDSandboxDevelopment

App load time: 195ms

ATTENTION: The default value of option force_s3tc_enable has been overridden by the environment.

The program 'atom' received an X Window System error. This likely indicates a bug in the program.
Error: BadAtom (invalid Atom parameter).
Details: serial 353, error_code 5, request_code 20, minor_code 0.

(Note to developers: X errors are typically reported asynchronously, meaning the error may be received some time after it was triggered. To facilitate debugging, run your program with the --sync command-line option. This will allow you to obtain a meaningful backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
```

This log provides insight into the conditions under which the error occurred, including the absence of the SUID sandbox and the specific X Window System error.
