When drag-drop a firefox tag across screens, the atom(0.190.0) will exit. On
Ubuntu 14.04, Firefox 37.01. Here's the console log .

The program 'atom' received an X Window System error.  
This probably reflects a bug in the program.  
The error was 'BadAtom (invalid Atom parameter)'.  
(Details: serial 353 error_code 5 request_code 20 minor_code 0)  
(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;  
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.  
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line  
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful  
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
