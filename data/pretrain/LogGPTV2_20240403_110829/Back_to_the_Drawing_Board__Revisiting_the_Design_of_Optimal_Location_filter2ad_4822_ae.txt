### Figure 7: Performance of Bounded Mechanisms in Terms of Conditional Entropy

Figure 7 illustrates the performance of bounded mechanisms in terms of conditional entropy. The results are similar to those observed in the unbounded scenario, with ExPost outperforming the other mechanisms, albeit with a slightly wider margin in this case. Since bounded mechanisms do not achieve geo-indistinguishability, we do not evaluate their performance with respect to this metric in this scenario.

### 5.2 Discrete Scenario

In this section, we consider a simple synthetic scenario and evaluate the optimal mechanisms obtained using the method proposed by Shokri et al. [27]. The authors introduce a linear program that finds an optimal mechanism \( f \) within the polytope of optimal mechanisms for PAE (Probabilistic Adversary Error) given a constraint \( Q \), i.e., \( f \in F_{\text{opt}}^Q \). This approach is highly versatile as it can be computed for any pair of distance functions \( d_P(\cdot) \) and \( d_Q(\cdot) \).

We set our synthetic scenario under the assumptions of Shokri et al.'s work: the input and output alphabets are discrete and identical, \( X = Z \), and the adversary can only estimate locations within the same alphabet, \( \hat{X} = X \). For simplicity, we consider that the set of locations in \( X \) are the centers of cells in a 5 × 5 square grid, and each location is tagged as "Home," "Park," "Shop," or "Café" (as shown in Fig. 8). We assume a uniform prior, \( \pi(x) = \frac{1}{25} \) for all \( x \in X \).

The point-wise loss is measured as the Euclidean distance \( d_Q(x, z) = ||x - z||_2 \). We also consider two point-wise metrics of privacy: the Euclidean distance and a semantic distance defined as the Hamming distance between tags, i.e., \( d_P(x, z) = 0 \) if Tag(x) = Tag(z), and \( d_P(x, z) = 1 \) otherwise. This metric is similar to the semantic metric in [1]. The average error computed using this distance function represents the probability that an adversary incorrectly guesses the tag of \( x \).

We evaluate ExPost and Coin mechanisms alongside the optimal mechanism proposed in [27]. For the latter, we solve the linear program to find optimal mechanisms in terms of maximizing PAE using the Euclidean distance (Fig. 9) and the semantic distance (Fig. 10). As expected, the optimal mechanisms (Shokri et al.) achieve the best privacy when evaluated using the adversary's error for which they are optimized (Figs. 9a and 10b), but not when evaluated against a different metric (Figs. 9b and 10a). ExPost and Coin mechanisms achieve maximum privacy in terms of Euclidean distance, as before, but not in terms of semantic distance. This example highlights that optimizing a mechanism with respect to one privacy metric may lead to poor performance with respect to other privacy criteria.

This experiment also reveals another important insight: even though the solutions of the linear program achieve approximately the same performance in terms of average error (optimal in Figs. 9a and 10b, suboptimal in Figs. 9b and 10a), they exhibit significantly different behavior in terms of conditional entropy. Using the mechanism computed with the simplex algorithm (a mechanism at a vertex of \( F_{\text{opt}}^Q \)), the adversary has much less uncertainty about \( x \) on average than if the user had implemented a mechanism from the interior of the polytope. This difference in entropy also allows us to distinguish between mechanisms like ExPost and Coin. Notably, the mechanism computed by solving the linear program with the simplex algorithm performs even worse than the coin in terms of entropy, illustrating the dangers of optimizing privacy in only one dimension.

### 6. Conclusions

In this work, we have demonstrated the limitations of using a single privacy metric as an indicator of the performance of location privacy-preserving mechanisms. We have shown that there is more than one optimal protection mechanism in terms of maximizing the average adversary error for a given average quality loss, and that these mechanisms behave differently with respect to other privacy metrics. Thus, optimizing defenses with only one privacy metric in mind may result in mechanisms that offer poor protection in other dimensions of privacy. To avoid selecting underperforming mechanisms, we propose the use of complementary criteria to guide the choice. We provide two example auxiliary metrics: conditional entropy and worst-case loss. We propose an optimal mechanism with respect to the former and provide means to implement mechanisms according to the latter.

We evaluate the mechanisms, comparing them to previous work, on two real datasets. Our experiments confirm two key points: first, that no mechanism can perform optimally with respect to every privacy metric. Second, that even if a mechanism performs well in a particular metric, it does not necessarily imply that it is beneficial for the user. These findings underscore the need to integrate privacy as a multi-dimensional notion in mechanism design to avoid solutions that provide a false sense of privacy.

### A. Appendix

#### A.1 Proof of Theorem 3.3

To prove this result, note that when \( d_P(\cdot) \equiv d_Q(\cdot) \), the quality loss \( Q \) is an upper bound of privacy PAE:
\[
PAE(f, \pi) = \int_{R^2} \left( \sum_{x \in X} \pi(x) \cdot f(z|x) \cdot d_P(x, \hat{x}) \right) dz \leq \int_{R^2} \left( \sum_{x \in X} \pi(x) \cdot f(z|x) \cdot d_Q(x, z) \right) dz = Q(f, \pi)
\]
Now, assume \( f' = f \circ g \), and therefore
\[
z = \arg\min_{z' \in R^2} \sum_{x \in X} \pi(x) \cdot f'(z|x) \cdot d_Q(x, z')
\]
The optimal adversary estimation of \( x \) given \( z \) is
\[
\hat{x}(z) = \arg\min_{\hat{x} \in R^2} \sum_{x \in X} \pi(x) \cdot f'(z|x) \cdot d_P(x, \hat{x})
\]
Since \( d_P(\cdot) \equiv d_Q(\cdot) \), the optimal adversary estimation is \( \hat{x}(z) = z \). This implies \( PAE(f', \pi) = Q(f', \pi) \), and since we have achieved the upper bound on privacy, \( f' \) is optimal.

#### A.2 Geo-Indistinguishability of the Posterior Exponential Mechanism

Geo-indistinguishability requires the following condition for discrete mechanisms, where \( p(z|x) \) denotes the probability of reporting \( z \) when the original location is \( x \):
\[
p(z|x) \leq e^{\epsilon \cdot d_P(x, x')} \cdot p(z|x'), \quad \forall x, x' \in X, z \in Z
\]
where \( d_P(x, x') \) is the Euclidean distance.

The last iteration of the ExPost algorithm returns a mechanism that can be written for a particular input \( x \) and output \( z \) as:
\[
p(z|x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{P_Z(z) \cdot e^{-b \cdot d_Q(x, z)}}{\sum_{z' \in Z} P_Z(z') \cdot e^{-b \cdot d_Q(x, z')}} & \text{if } P_Z(z) > 0 \\
0 & \text{if } P_Z(z) = 0
\end{cases}
\]
Using the triangular inequality \( d_Q(x, z) + d_Q(x', z) \geq d_Q(x, x') \), we can write:
\[
p(z|x) \leq P_Z(z) \cdot e^{b \cdot d_Q(x, x')} \cdot e^{-b \cdot d_Q(x', z)} \cdot \frac{1}{\sum_{z' \in Z} P_Z(z') \cdot e^{-b \cdot d_Q(x, z')}}
\]
\[
= e^{2b \cdot d_Q(x, x')} \cdot p(z|x')
\]
which satisfies geo-indistinguishability for \( \epsilon = 2b \) or \( PGI = \frac{1}{2b} \) if \( d_Q(\cdot) \) is the Euclidean distance. This concludes the proof.

#### A.3 Performance of Unbounded Mechanisms in Terms of Average Error

When the average error (Euclidean) and the average quality loss (Euclidean) are used to evaluate the performance of the mechanisms described in Section 5, we achieve the trivial result \( PAE = Q \). This is shown in Fig. 11 for completeness.
