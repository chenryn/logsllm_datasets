I started experiencing an unexpected issue with my Mac Pro running OS v10.9.5 yesterday. The problem is that I am no longer able to properly provision my machines; the system either hangs during the first run or reboots after I interrupt the process and attempt it again.

To resolve this, I have tried applying a fix to sshpass 1.05 and even downgrading to version 1.04, but neither solution has worked. I have also attempted to provide the password in the HOSTS file and used the `--ask-pass` option, but these methods have not resolved the issue either.

Is there any known solution for Mac users facing this problem? This issue is similar to the one discussed in [this GitHub thread](https://github.com//issues/5007).

Thank you for your assistance.
