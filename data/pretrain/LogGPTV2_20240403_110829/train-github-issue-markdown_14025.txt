This has started to happen to me yesterday out of the blue. I have Mac Pro OS
v 10.9.5. Now I can't even provision my machines properly - Mac just reboots
(it hangs on the first run, after I ^C and run another one - it reboots).  
I've tried applying fix from the note above to sshpass 1.05 and tried to bing
1.04 (which doesn't work at all).  
Are there any solutions for the Mac users?  
I've tried to provide pass in the HOSTS file and with --ask-pass - same result
