User: How to configure the firewall to prevent malicious attacks? Please provide the actual operation steps and explain the principle.
Assistant: firewall is a network security device that manages network communications and monitors the traffic going in and out of the network. By configuring firewalls and taking effective security measures, you can help protect network security and prevent malicious attacks. Here are some practical steps to prevent malicious attacks: 1. Turn on the firewall: Make sure the firewall is enabled and properly configured to filter ingress and egress traffic as needed. 2. Disable unnecessary ports: Close unnecessary ports and restrict access, so that attackers cannot invade the network through these ports. 3. Filter inbound and outbound traffic: only allow legitimate traffic from trusted networks and users, and block any malicious traffic or traffic from unauthorized sources. 4. Enable IDS and IPS services: IDS (Intrusion Detection System) and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) are designed to detect and prevent network attacks, and the services can be enabled through the firewall. 5. Update software versions and patches: Update software versions and patches in a timely manner to ensure that defects are fixed and prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited. 6. Set Access Control List (ACL): ACL is a method to control access to the network or specific network resources. ACL can be created and set through the firewall to allow only authorized users to access network resources. 7. Use VPN: Use VPN to encrypt network transmission and data flow, avoid network theft, and implement screening of VPN entry points through firewalls. Overall, with these practical steps, you can improve network security, prevent malicious attacks, and protect enterprise data and assets.
