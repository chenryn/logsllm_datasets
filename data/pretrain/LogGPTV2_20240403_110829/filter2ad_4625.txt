Abstract.  This  paper  presents  WebIDS,  a  learning-based  anomaly  detection 
system for Web applications aiming at improving the decision process, reducing 
the number of false positives, and achieving distributed detection. 
Keywords: Anomaly detection, Correlation, Web application. 
1   Introduction 
Attacks on Web applications and services have been increasing dramatically for the 
last  years.  Related  approaches  in  intrusion  detection  are  still  rare.  The  major  chal-
lenges anomaly-based systems have to solve in the field are the improvement of the 
decision  process,  the  reduction  of  the  high  number  of  (false)  alarms  caused  by  un-
usual activities, and the recent need of distributed intrusion detection. At the crossing 
of  these  research  areas,  the  aim  of  our  work  is  to  propose  an  efficient  distributed 
anomaly detection system dedicated to the security of Web applications. 
2   Our Proposal: WebIDS 
WebIDS analyzes HTTP GET requests as logged by Apache Web servers. The analy-
sis process is based on a multi-model approach [5] implementing ten statistical algo-
rithms:  attribute  length,  attribute  character  distribution,  structural  inference,  token 
finder,  attribute  presence  or  absence,  attribute  order,  access  frequency,  inter-request 
delay,  invocation  order,  and  anomaly  history  (which  allows,  among  others,  keeping 
track of alarms). The system requires no special configuration (autonomous learning). 
A non-naive Bayesian network is used as a decision process [3], classifying the events 
more accurately and incorporating information about confidence in the models. At the 
root node, a specification of the event classification [6] distinguishes between a nor-
mal state and five Web attack states (authentication, XSS, command execution, denial 
of service, and other attack). The system is improved after each log analysis by filter-
ing out false positives using an alarm clustering technique [2]. As part of the anomaly

history  model,  a  cooperation  feature  enables  the  system  to  achieve  alarm  and  event 
correlation  [4].  The  Intrusion  Detection  Message  Exchange  Format  (IDMEF)  [1]  is 
used for sharing alarm information between systems. 
3   Experimental Results 
WebIDS has been implemented in an IT company based in Luxembourg and showed 
good detection rates (sensitivity of 96.02 %, specificity of 99.99 %, and reliability of 
99.94  %).  The  false  positive  rate  (0.01422  %)  is  lower  than  the  rates  observed  for 
similar  systems.  Nevertheless,  these  results  must  be  mitigated  because  only  a  small 
number  of  anomalies  could  be  observed  by  WebIDS  over  the  experimental  period, 
and the comparison with existing systems is not based on the same dataset. 
4   Conclusion and Future Work 
As a conclusion, we can state that the cooperative anomaly-based intrusion detection 
system proposed is both innovative and efficient. By improving the decision process, 
reducing  the  false  positive  rate  and  enabling  cooperation  between  systems,  it  meets 
the defined challenges. As a follow-up to this research, the deployment of WebIDS in 
a more widely distributed environment is currently considered. Some functional and 
technical improvements are being carried out for that purpose.
