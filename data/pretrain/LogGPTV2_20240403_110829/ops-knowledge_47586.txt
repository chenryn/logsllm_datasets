User: I accidentally downloaded Python 3.4.2 a while back but I actually needed Python 2.7, so I deleted the 3.4.2 files and downloaded 2.7 instead. Now I need Python 3, so I tried to download it but I noticed that in the control panel in the Uninstall Programs section it tells me that the 3.4.2 from back then is still on my PC.
Every time I try to uninstall/change/repair/download a newer version I can't and it tells me 

A program required to complete the installation can not be found...

I can not find any remaining files connected to any sort of Python in my PC. My operating system is Windows 10. Does someone know how to solve this?
Assistant: Did you try to reinstall the version you want to delete and then uninstall it afterwards ?
