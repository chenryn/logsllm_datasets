Another well-known life science ontology is the Microarray Gene
Expression Data (MGED) ontology. MGED provides standard terms
in the form of an ontology organized into classes with properties for
the annotation of microarray experiments (MGED 2005). These terms
provide an unambiguous description of how experiments were
performed and enable structured queries of elements of the
experiments. The comparison between different experiments is only
feasible if there is a standardization in the terminology for describing
experimental setup, mathematical post-processing of raw
measurements, genes, tissues, and samples. The adoption of common
standards by the research community for describing data makes it
possible to develop systems for the management, storage, transfer,
mining, and sharing of microarray data (Stoeckert, Causton et al.
2002).
If data from every microarray experiment carried out by different
research group were stored with the same structure, in the same type
of database, the manipulation of data would be relatively easy.
Unfortunately, in practice, different research group have very different
requirements and, therefore, applications need mappings and
translations between the different existing formats (Stoeckert, Causton
et al. 2002).
28 Semantic Web Processes and Their Applications
Software programs utilizing the MGED ontology generate forms
for annotation, populate databases directly, or generate files in an
established format. The ontology can be used by researchers to
annotate their experiments as well as by software developers to
implement practical applications.
7. CONCLUSIONS
Since its creation, the World Wide Web has allowed computers
only to understand Web page layout for display purposes, without
having access to their intended meaning. Now the Web has advanced
to a lot more than a medium to publish data and documents; a Web
resource can be a component of what is called deep web (such as a
queryable database) or a service that wraps an application. The
semantic Web aims to enrich this Web with a layer of machine-
understandable metadata to enable the machine processing of
information and services. The semantic Web is not a separate Web but
an extension of the current one, in which information and services are
given well-defined meaning, thereby better enabling computers and
people to work in cooperation. To make possible the creation of the
semantic Web the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has been
actively working on the definition of open standards, such as the RDF
(Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology
Language), and encourage their use by both the industry and
academia. These standards are also important for e-commerce and e-
science, involving sharing of services and the integration for intra- and
inter-business processes that have become widespread due to the
development of business-to-business and business-to-customer
infrastructures.
To fully appreciate the objective of semantics and the semantic
Web, it is essential to comprehend what is the place and role of
semantics in science in general and computer science in particular.
The heterogeneity of the data occurs when there are differences in
syntax, representation (e.g. format or structure), and semantics of data.
Dealing with heterogeneity has continued to be a key challenge since
the time it has been possible to exchange and share data between
computers and applications. Given the ease of publication and sharing
of data and services on the Web, and the scale involved, the problem
has assumed greater importance on the Web. From the various types
of heterogeneity, the semantic heterogeneity is a particularly vexing
The Semantic Web and its Applications 29
problem. It arises due to a disagreement about the meaning,
interpretation, or intended use of the same or related data. One
approach to the problems of semantic heterogeneity is to rely on the
technological foundations of the semantic Web. More precisely, to
define the meaning of the terminology of data using the concepts
present in an ontology to make clear the relationships and differences
between concepts.
The theories, methodologies, algorithms, and technologies
associated with semantic Web make this approach to application and
data integration a strong candidate to solve many problems that
current systems face. Currently, Web services, tourism information
systems, digital libraries, and bioinformatics are some of the leading
areas that are studying the potential brought by semantics and
ontologies to solve the integration and interoperability problems they
have been confronted for many years. For example, semantic Web
services are the result of the evolution of the syntactic definition of
Web services and the semantic Web. The idea behind Web services is
to map concepts in a Web service description to ontological concepts.
Using this approach, users can explicitly define the semantics of a
Web service for a given domain. Afterwards, using the semantics
added to Web services we are able to construct queries using concepts
defined in an ontological domain to enable the discovery of service
obtaining search results that are more relevant than keyword or
attribute-based matching algorithms. Even more significant
advantages can be realized when developing mappings for exchanging
messages between services participating in a process.
8. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
Beginner:
1. Why is the search provided by Google, Yahoo! and MSN not
semantic?
2. Why and how can metadata help in dealing with unstructured,
semi-structured, and structured data?
Intermediate:
1. Why almost all of the semantic metadata efforts involve textual
data? Does it make sense to have an ontology of icons or
symbols?
30 Semantic Web Processes and Their Applications
2. What would it take to represent concepts found in the natural
world, such as compounds and molecules?
3. Distinguish between database schemas and ontologies in terms of
conceptual models or representation languages, intentions or uses,
and development methodologies.
4. List various techniques used for metadata extraction from different
computer science areas.
5. What are the differences in metadata for Web resources that are
data versus services?
6. How would Amazon benefit from the use of a product ontology?
Advance:
1. Discuss how would you define the quality of an ontology.
2. Distinguish between ontologies (representation,
extraction/population, etc.) when modeling human activities (e.g.,
travel, financial services, sports, entertainment) versus natural
phenomena and sciences (e.g., earthquakes, complex
carbohydrates, protein-protein interactions, cancer research).
Practical Exercises:
1. Identify unstructured, semi-structured and structured documents on
the same subject matter, such as a new on a football game
(although actual content may be different). Develop a small
ontology related to this subject matter. Annotate each of these
documents.
2. Obtain at least one RDF(S) and one OWL ontology and load it
using an ontology editor (e.g., Protégé).
3. Look up a tool or service on the Web for annotating Web pages
and Web services.
4. Take a Web page on a news site. Design a small ontology related
to the subject matter or domain of that page. Write syntactic,
structural, and semantic metadata of that page.
