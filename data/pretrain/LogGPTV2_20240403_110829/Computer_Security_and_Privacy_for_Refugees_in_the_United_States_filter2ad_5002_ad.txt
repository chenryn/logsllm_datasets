### Visibility and Password Strength
The lack of visibility in certain scenarios may lead to refugees creating weaker passwords, such as those using only one character set. This can compromise the security of their accounts.

### Security Questions
Although security questions are commonly used for account recovery, their effectiveness is often questionable [19]. These questions are frequently designed with implicit U.S. cultural knowledge and norms, making them less applicable or even inapplicable to refugees. For example, questions about a mother’s maiden name are not useful in cultures where women do not change their names after marriage (T4). Additionally, some questions may be difficult or impossible for individuals with limited English skills or who did not grow up in the U.S. For instance, refugees from small villages in East Africa may not have street names, and some may never have attended school or owned a car. Moreover, some questions may ask for information that is typically private in the U.S. but common knowledge in other cultures, or information that is not considered important or unique, such as birthdates. As a result, refugees' responses to these questions may be insecure or easily forgotten: “For a newcomer, they might not be used to keeping that kind of information in their heads, so I think that they might make up answers and then forget, or forget what the question was asking” (T4).

### Email Account Management
Given that a primary goal of case managers is to help refugees find jobs, and email access is crucial for job searches, we will now delve deeper into the relationship between case managers and their clients' email accounts.

#### Case Managers and Teachers as Primary Users
Case managers and teachers often become the primary users of their clients' email accounts, maintaining credentials and handling job-related emails on behalf of their clients. This practice, especially when the refugee also uses the email account for personal purposes, presents a trade-off between potential vulnerabilities and the critical utility of the email account in the job search process. In short, refugees heavily rely on their case managers and teachers for help with email use and account management, which necessitates a significant level of trust.

#### Password Management Strategies
To efficiently check 40-50 clients' emails daily and assist with forgotten passwords, case managers have developed specific password management strategies. Some case managers keep spreadsheets with all their clients' email usernames and passwords, while others store the credentials on paper, which is locked away daily. One case manager uses the same password for all clients for whom they create a password. Similarly, teachers maintain copies of clients' email credentials to facilitate access and password recovery.

These strategies, including storing and reusing passwords, do not align with many common password best practices and are vulnerable to certain types of attacks. However, the time constraints and primary goals of case managers and teachers—to efficiently and effectively help refugees find jobs—often outweigh the benefits of more secure password practices.

#### Email Content Access
Since case managers and teachers often have access to their clients' email accounts, the contents of these accounts are not private and are subject to the security and privacy decisions of the case managers and teachers. CM5, for example, mentioned seeing personal emails but ignores them out of respect for the client's privacy: “When I check emails... they’re sometimes sent from friends, back home. I don’t care about them. I look for ones that are job-related. I can tell when they are personal. Sometimes the emails are in [their native language, which CM5 fluently speaks], so I can tell it’s from a friend or relative.” This highlights the power that case managers and teachers have over these accounts.

### Website Legitimacy
Earlier, we noted that teachers and case managers try to help clients understand the importance of protecting against scams and identity theft. However, even if refugees recognize the importance, many lack the technical experience to protect themselves online. Teachers and case managers emphasized that their clients need to be more cautious about sharing information online (T1, T2, T3, CM2, CM3) and indicated that their clients often do not look for technical clues of illegitimate websites, such as inspecting URLs or domains (T2, T3, CM3, CM4).

While case managers and teachers generally do not observe refugees directly inspecting URLs, refugees sometimes employ strategies to ensure they visit only trusted websites. For example, R3c discussed only visiting known websites, and CM1 advises clients to trust only websites printed on job applications or business cards. Standard security measures, like HTTPS or browser phishing warnings, were not frequently mentioned in our interviews.

Refugees often turn to their teachers and case managers for help in determining whether a website is legitimate. CM1 recounted: “Most of [the] clients, they don’t want to put their private things on the internet, they don’t trust that much. They are new, they say, ‘oh, is it okay to put in this, I try to apply this job on this website, is it proper to put my social security here?’”

However, caution with website identity is rare. T3 was surprised to see that some clients did not fill out their social security numbers on job applications, but emphasized that they were a minority. Even those who know to be cautious lack the technical expertise to independently decide whether a website is legitimate. R3a explained that she provides her information to websites when necessary, despite the risks: “Everything has risks – social worker, case managers – whoever you share your information with, you have no idea what they will do with that information. But if you do not provide your information, you cannot get what you are trying to get from them. It’s a gambling situation. In order to gain something, you have to give up.”

### Physical Document Security
Refugees frequently interact with bureaucratic processes, such as those involving government agencies or potential employers, which require identifying documents. As a result, they often carry these documents on their person. In some cases, and sometimes on the advice of case managers or teachers, refugees store social security numbers and other personally identifiable information (PII) on their phones, along with photos of documents like passports and social security cards.

Whether carrying physical documents or photos on potentially unlocked phones, the need to carry this information creates a risk for identity theft if the information is compromised. The practice of storing these documents on phones makes the protection of these devices and their digital contents crucial. Participants shared anecdotes about lost phones (T2, CM2, CM3, R1a), and CM3 expressed concern about the resulting potential risk of identity theft: “She’s like, ‘When I go to these appointments, whether it’s electric help, whether it’s the housing help, they need the information, and I can’t grab all the papers all the time, so I have on my phone.’ And I said, ‘Oh, you have a bigger problem on your hand than just losing your phone.’ And it was unlocked, no code. I said, ‘No.’ I told her... ‘hopefully you don’t get your identity stolen that way but social security, date of birth, and name, and addresses, you gave it to them on a golden plate’ [emphasis added].”

### Safety of Communications
Despite fleeing real threats of state-sponsored violence, many refugees feel sufficiently protected by the U.S. government once they resettle and are no longer worried about violence or surveillance from their home governments (T1, T2, T3, T4, CM1, CM2, CM3). Generally, refugees also trust the U.S. government, as it brought them to the U.S., and they are not concerned about potential surveillance from the U.S. government (T1, T3, T4, CM1, CM2, CM3). “They feel safe saying whatever they want to say because they come to this country, they know they have that freedom of speech and stuff. They’re okay to say whatever they want to say... Once [they]’re here, they feel like, ‘Okay, I can voice myself now’” (CM3).

For example, T3 told a story about a refugee who was in great danger in his country for filming human rights violations on his phone but felt very safe in the U.S. In response to a question about whether they or any of their clients would talk about politics outside Eritrea, since talking about politics inside Eritrea is dangerous, CM1 said: “Outside, yeah. As you like, yes.”

However, some refugees still have concerns, though case managers and teachers said these refugees are exceptions. CM1 indicated that some refugees self-censor in the U.S. out of fear of informants or surveillance from their home country. Syrian refugees, for instance, avoid discussing politics to protect their friends and family who remain in Syria: “Here, we don’t feel, you know, we aren’t afraid of anything, we feel very comfortable here, but we are worried about our relatives in different countries, in Syria, to say something that might affect them” (R1d).

Some participants indirectly indicated concerns about the U.S. government. For example, during a focus group, one participant asked if the interview data would be shared with the CIA (though this participant did consent, and we received permission from our IRB to include this observation). While teachers and case managers said refugees were not worried about U.S. surveillance, they shared anecdotes of refugees being uncomfortable with the information they had to provide. CM4 mentioned that Muslim refugees, in particular, might censor their speech or actions due to recent U.S. politics, though this was not the majority.

Finally, some participants said that refugees prefer to conduct business in person. Related to their attention to physical security, refugees use non-digital and in-person information exchanges to protect their information. R3a, for example, conducts business in person whenever possible after being scammed twice, as she does not know how to verify identity over the phone or online: “In person, yeah. If it’s an office, I try to visit way ahead of time. If it’s making a payment, I like to visit the actual location I need to submit my payments to instead of doing it online or over the phone. Because even over the phone you have no idea what they’re going to do with that. Scary thing” (R3a).

CM1 noted that, in general, when asked for information that could be given over multiple media, clients “feel comfortable to give the paper rather than to send the picture” but, due to time constraints, “they send the picture because of the time limit” (CM1). The decision to share information only in person may have perceived or actual security benefits but can also create barriers to refugees' other goals, including establishing a life in the U.S. (CM4).

### Computer Security Advice Given to Refugees
Finally, we consider the computer security and privacy advice given to refugees, either directly by case managers or teachers, or by others with whom refugees interact (e.g., friends or family). Understanding this advice helps shed light on the sources of refugees' concerns and practices [20], [21]. Since most or all of the people from whom refugees receive advice are not technology or security experts, this advice reflects potentially incomplete or inaccurate threat models or mitigation strategies. Therefore, interventions to improve security and privacy for refugees must consider this broader ecosystem of technology users.

#### General Constraints on Security Advice
All teachers provide some security advice (physical or computer) to their students in class, but T1, T2, and T3 expressed a desire to include more security advice (though these statements may have been influenced by speaking to us, security researchers). They, along with T4, CM4, and CM5, identified time and resources (i.e., access to computers for teaching) as limitations. CM4 explained that both time and the clients' own prioritization of computer skills (including secure behavior and mental models) are limitations: “They’re adults. It’s very hard in one shot to convince them that this is very important for your life, in day-to-day life. Just delivering that information doesn’t make them change; it has to touch their heart, it has to touch their soul, they have to feel it. Just giving them one lecture about the use of computers... It has to go beyond that.”

Some case managers and teachers indicated that they have advice they do not give, either because their clients are not technically ready for it (T1, T2, T3) or because they prefer to let their clients make their own decisions (CM3).

#### Concrete Advice on Protecting Personal Information from Scams
Recall from Section V-B that case managers and teachers identified scams and identity theft as potential new risks for refugees and said they try to instill awareness of these risks. T4 and T1 specifically talk to their classes about phone scams. T1 advises their clients to “just hang up” if “you get a call from a number that you don’t know and they’re saying something and asking you questions,” and T4 tells them about “information that you never tell anybody over the phone because nobody will ever ask you for it,” like “your social security number.”

Like T4, CM3 also emphasizes the importance of not giving out social security numbers, and CM1 and CM2 said that refugees hear about the importance of keeping their social security number private from other sources, such as more experienced refugees from the same community.

The cultural orientation that refugees receive before resettling in the U.S. includes information about potential scammers and the importance of keeping personal information private. The orientation “let[s] you know that there could be scammers, you should keep your personal information safe and in a secure place, you shouldn’t share your personal information with others” (CM1).

#### Advice on Website Identity
Beyond general advice about protecting personal information, case managers and teachers also attempt to teach their clients how to avoid scam websites. T1 and T3 send emails to their classes with links and encourage their students to read the emails before clicking on links. CM1 advises their clients to “use the link that...
