is not visible. Attempting to avoid this challenge may result
in refugees creating weaker passwords (e.g., using only one
character set).
Security Questions. Though security questions for account
recovery provide questionable security [19], they are never-
theless common. However, we ﬁnd that security questions
are designed with implicit US cultural knowledge and norms
embedded — sometimes making these questions inapplicable
to refugees. For example, questions about a mother’s maiden
name are not useful for people from cultures in which women
do not take their husband’s name (T4). Other questions are
difﬁcult or impossible for people with limited English skills or
who did not grow up in the US: some refugees have never gone
to school or owned a car, and small villages in East Africa,
for example, may not have street names. Similarly, some
questions may ask about information that is typically private
in the US but common knowledge in other cultures (e.g.,
family or childhood details), or may ask about information not
considered important or distinct (e.g., birthdates). As a result,
refugees’ responses to security questions may be insecure or
easily forgotten: “For a newcomer, they might not be used to
keeping that kind of information in their heads, so I think that
they might make up answers and then forget, or forget what
the question was asking” (T4).
2) EMAIL ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
Since a primary goal of case managers is to help their clients
ﬁnd jobs, and since email access is critical to refugees’ job
search, we now turn more deeply to the relationship between
case managers and their clients’ email.
Case managers and teachers often become primary users of
these accounts, maintaining credentials as well as reading and
responding to job-related emails on behalf of their clients. This
practice (particularly when a refugee also uses that email ac-
count for personal purposes) trades off potential vulnerabilities
with the critical utility of an email account as part of the job
search process. In short, refugees rely heavily on their case
managers and teachers for help with email use and account
management, which means that refugees must trust their case
managers signiﬁcantly.
Password Management Across Refugees. In order to efﬁ-
ciently check 40-50 clients’ emails every day, and to help

clients in the (frequent) cases where they forget their pass-
words, case managers have developed certain password man-
agement strategies to streamline their process. Three case man-
agers keep spreadsheets with all their clients’ email usernames
and passwords, and another case manager keeps the credentials
“on a paper in the [client’s] ﬁle,” which “gets locked up every
day.” One of the case managers who keeps a spreadsheet also
uses the same password for all clients for whom they create
a password. Likewise, teachers keep copies of clients’ email
credentials to help with email account access and recovering
from forgotten passwords.
these strategies reﬂect
These password management strategies — including storing
and reusing passwords — do not conform to many common
password “best practices” and are vulnerable to certain classes
of attackers. However,
the tensions
in the time constraints and main goals of case
inherent
managers and teachers:
to efﬁciently and effectively help
refugees ﬁnd jobs. Thus, for case manager and teachers, the
beneﬁts of insisting on more secure password strategies may
be outweighed by the beneﬁts of efﬁciently logging in to their
clients’ email accounts.
Email Content Access. Because case managers and teachers
often have access to their clients’ email accounts, the contents
of these accounts are not private, and are also subject to
the security and privacy decisions of the teachers and case
managers. CM5 mentioned seeing clients’ personal emails, but
ignores them out of respect for the client’s privacy: “when
I check emails. . . they’re sometimes sent from friends, back
home. I don’t care about
them. I look for ones that are
job related. I can tell when they are personal. Sometimes
the emails are in [their native language, which CM5 ﬂuently
speaks], so I can tell it’s from a friend or relative.” Though
CM5 ignores these emails, this speaks to the power that case
managers and teachers have to access these accounts.
3) WEB SITE LEGITIMACY
Earlier we note that teachers and case managers try to help
clients understand the importance of protecting against scams
and identity theft. But even if refugees know it is important,
teachers and case managers said that many of their clients lack
the technical experience to protect themselves online and with
their digital assets. Teachers and case managers felt that their
clients need to be more careful giving out information online
(T1, T2, T3, CM2 CM3) and indicated that their clients often
do not look for technical clues of illegitimate websites, like
inspecting URLs or domains (T2, T3, CM3, CM4).
Although case managers and teachers generally did not
observe refugees directly inspecting URLs to judge the legiti-
mately of websites, refugees do sometimes employ strategies
to ensure that they only visit trusted websites. For example,
R3c discussed only visiting websites that she already knows,
and CM1 advises their clients to only trust websites printed
on a job application or a business card. Over the course of
our interviews, standard security measures — like HTTPS or
browser phishing warnings — did not come up.
We also ﬁnd that refugees commonly turn to their teachers
and case managers for help determining whether a website is
legitimate. CM1 recounts: “Most of [the] clients, they don’t
want to put their private things on the internet, they don’t
trust that much. They are new, they say, ‘oh, is it okay to put
in this, I try to apply this job on this website, is it proper to
put my social security here?’ ”
However, other case managers and teachers observed that
caution with website identity was rare. For example, T3 was
happily surprised to see that some of their clients did not
ﬁll out their social security number on a job application, but
emphasized that they were a minority.
Even those who know to be cautious do not have the
technical expertise and experience to independently decide
whether a website is legitimate. R3a explained that she puts
her information into websites when necessary, even knowing
risks: “Everything has risks – social worker, case managers –
whoever you share your information with, you have no idea
what they will do with that information. But if you do not
provide your information, you cannot get what you are trying
to get from them. It’s a gambling situation. In order to gain
something, you have to give up.”
4) PHYSICAL DOCUMENTS SECURITY
Because refugees frequently interact with various bureau-
cratic processes (e.g., with government agencies or potential
employers) requiring identifying documents, they frequently
carry these documents on their person. In some cases —
and sometimes on the advice of case managers or teachers
who encouraged refugees not to carry the original copies —
refugees instead keep social security numbers and other PII
stored on their phones, as well as photos of documents like
passports and social security cards.
Whether carrying physical documents or photos of docu-
ments on (potentially unlocked) phones, the need to carry
this information creates a risk for identity theft when this
information is compromised. Further, the practice of storing
these documents on the phones makes the protection of
these phones — and their digital contents — important. Indeed,
participants told anecdotes about lost phones (T2, CM2, CM3,
R1a) and CM3 expressed concern about the resulting potential
risk of identity theft (though none of the scam anecdotes we
heard were due to lost phones or documents): “She’s like,
‘When I go to these appointments, whether it’s electric help,
whether it’s the housing help, they need the information, and
I can’t grab all the papers all the time, so I have on my
phone.’ And I said, ‘Oh, you have a bigger problem on your
hand than just losing your phone.’ And it was unlocked, no
code. I said, ‘No.’ I told her . . . ‘hopefully you don’t get your
identity stolen that way but social security, date of birth, and
name, and addresses, you gave it to them on a golden plate”
[emphasis added].
5) SAFETY OF COMMUNICATIONS
Despite ﬂeeing very real threats of state-sponsored vio-
lence, many refugees are no longer worried about violence or
417

surveillance from their home governments once they resettle
in the US because they feel sufﬁciently protected by the US
government (T1, T2, T3, T4, CM1, CM2, CM3). In general,
refugees also trust the US government since it brought them
to the US, and say that they are not concerned about any
potential surveillance from the US government (T1, T3, T4,
CM1, CM2, CM3). “They feel safe saying whatever they want
to say because they come to this country, they know they have
that freedom of speech and stuff. They’re okay to say whatever
they want to say . . . Once [they]’re here, they feel like, ‘Okay,
I can voice myself now’ ” (CM3).
For example, T3 told a story about a refugee who was in
great danger in his country for ﬁlming human rights violations
on his phone, but felt very safe in the US. In answer to a
question about whether they or any of their clients would
talk about politics outside Eritrea, since talking about politics
inside Eritrea is dangerous, CM1 said: “Outside, yeah. As you
like, yes.”
However, these concerns remain for some refugees, though
case managers and teachers said that these refugees are excep-
tions to the rule. CM1 did indicate that some refugees censor
themselves in the US as they did in their home country, out
of fear of informants or other surveillance from their home
country. The Syrian refugees we spoke with indicated that
they would not talk about politics for fear of something bad
happening to their friends and family who are not in the US:
“Here, we don’t feel, you know, we aren’t afraid of anything,
we feel very comfortable here, but we are worried about our
relatives in different countries, in Syria, to say something that
might affect them” (R1d).
Although few participants directly said so, some indicated
that there was concern about the US government as well.
For example, while deciding whether to consent
to audio
recording, one focus group participant asked whether the
interview data would make its way back to the CIA. (We note
that this participant did consent, and we received permission
from our IRB to include this observation.) And although
teachers and case managers said refugees were not worried
about surveillance from the US, they told anecdotes in which
refugees were uncomfortable with the information that they
had to give out. CM4 said that Muslim refugees in particular
might censor their speech or actions due to recent US politics,
but also indicated that was not the majority.
Finally, some participants said that refugees preferred to
conduct business in person. Related to refugees’ attention
to physical security, we found that they use non-digital and
in-person information exchanges as a strategy for protecting
information. R3a, for example, conducts business in person if
at all possible after being scammed twice because she does not
know how to truly verify identity over the phone or online:
“In person, yeah. If it’s an ofﬁce, I try to visit way ahead of
time. If it’s making a payment, I like to visit the actual location
I need to submit my payments to instead of doing it online or
over the phone. Because even over the phone you have no idea
what they’re going to do with that. Scary thing” (R3a).
CM1 said that in general, when asked for information that
could be given over multiple media, clients “feel comfortable
to give the paper rather than to send the picture” but because
they are extremely busy, “they send the picture because of
the time limit” (CM1). The decision to share information only
in person may have perceived or actual security beneﬁts, but
it can also create barriers to refugees’ other goals, including
establishing a life in the US (CM4).
D. Computer Security Advice Given to Refugees
Finally, we consider computer security and privacy advice
given to refugees, either directly by case managers or teach-
ers, or by others with whom refugees interact (e.g., friends
or family). Similar to prior work on security advice more
generally, understanding this advice helps shed partial light
on the sources of refugees’ concerns and practices [20], [21].
Because most or all of the people from whom refugees receive
advice are not
themselves technology or security experts,
this advice reﬂects the (potentially incomplete or inaccurate)
threat models or mitigation strategies of these people. Thus,
interventions to improve security and privacy for refugees must
consider this broader ecosystem of technology users.
General Constraints on Security Advice. All teachers give
some security advice (physical or computer) to their students
in class, but T1, T2, and T3 expressed a desire to include more
security advice in their classes (though we note that these
statements may have been inﬂuenced by the fact that they
were speaking to us, security researchers). They, along with
T4, CM4, and CM5, identiﬁed time and resources (i.e., access
to computers for teaching) as a limitation. CM4 explained
that both time and the clients’ own prioritization of computer
skills (including secure behavior and mental models) are both
limitations: “They’re adults. It’s very hard in one shot to
convince them that this is very important for your life, in day
to day life. Just only delivering that information doesn’t make
them change, it has to touch their heart, it has to touch their
soul, they have to feel it. Just giving them one lecture about
the use of computers. . . It has to go beyond that.”
Some of the same case managers and teachers indicated
that they have advice that they do not give, either because
their clients are not technically ready for it (T1, T2, T3), or
because they, the case managers, prefer to let their clients make
their own decisions (CM3).
Now, we turn to the concrete advice that case managers and
teachers do give their clients about protecting themselves.
Advice about Protecting Personal Information from Scams.
Recall from Section V-B that case managers and teachers
identiﬁed scams and identity theft as potentially new risks
for refugees, and said that they try to instill an awareness
of these risks. T4 and T1 talk to their classes speciﬁcally
about phone scams. T1 advises their clients to “just hang up”
if “you get a call from a number that you don’t know and
they’re saying something and asking you questions,” and T4
tells them about “information that you never tell anybody over
the phone because nobody will ever ask you for it,” like “your
social security number.”

Like T4, CM3 also emphasizes the importance of not giving
out social security numbers, and CM1 and CM2 said that
refugees hear about the importance of keeping their social
security number private from other sources, such as other,
more experienced refugees from the same community.
The cultural orientation that refugees receive before re-
settling in the US also includes information about potential
scammers and the importance of keeping certain personal
information private. The orientation “let[s] you know that
there could be scammers, you should keep your personal
information safe and in a secure place, you shouldn’t share
your personal information with others” (CM1).
Advice about Website Identity. Beyond general advice about
protecting personal information, case managers and teachers
also attempt to teach their clients how to avoid scam websites
in particular. T1 and T3 send emails to their classes with links,
and try to get their students to actually read the emails before
clicking on links. CM1 tells their clients to “use the link that
