After the version r74 the BoxHelper does not work for sprites - ( Sprite &
SpriteMaterial) because the BoxHelper uses the function Box3 and that function
needs geometry to calculate the min, max....
Before and r74 the Sprite had:
geometry: THREE.BufferGeometry  
geometry.type: "BufferGeometry"
But after r74 the geometry property in the object created with new
THREE.Sprite does not exist AND so the Box3 does not work and so the BoxHelper
does not work.
