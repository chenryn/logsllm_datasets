Symfony version | 3.*  
i think the functions from Intl/ResourceBundle should be awailable as twig
functions or filter.  
like doing "` val | language_name`" should do
"`Intl::getLanguageBundle()->getLanguageName(val)`"  
I Think Filter is better than Function?
but i don't know if they should be added to Symfony/Bridge/Twig, or be an
extra bundle.
what should it be use for?  
like when creating an view of a Model or Entity and you get "de" as value it
should be turn it into "German".
