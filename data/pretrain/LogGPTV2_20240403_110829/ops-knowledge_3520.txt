User: How to ensure high availability of web application system by using failover cluster technology? Please consider load balancing, data synchronization, etc.
Assistant: Failover cluster technology is a technology used to ensure high availability of web application systems. It can be achieved through load balancing, data synchronization and other aspects. 1. Load balancing: Deploy a load balancer on multiple servers in the cluster, and the load balancer can distribute user requests to different servers to achieve load balancing. When one of the servers fails, the load balancer can forward the request to other healthy servers, thus ensuring the high availability of the web application system. 2. Data synchronization: All servers in the cluster use the same data source. When one server fails, other servers can automatically take over its data processing tasks. To ensure data consistency, master-slave replication or multi-master replication can be used for data synchronization. Data is updated on the master server and then automatically assigned to other servers for synchronization. 3. Heartbeat detection: Heartbeat detection is used to detect the survival status of the server. When a server in the cluster fails, the server can be automatically removed from the cluster through the heartbeat detection mechanism, so as to ensure that other servers continue to process requests. 4. Service Fault Tolerance: By adopting a service fault tolerance mechanism, when a service fails, the service can be switched without affecting the service, and the data consistency of the service can be ensured, which can ensure the high availability of the web application system. In short, using failover cluster technology, while ensuring high availability of the web application system, it can realize load balancing, data synchronization, heartbeat detection, service fault tolerance and other functions, thereby improving the stability and reliability of web applications.
