I'd like the ability to extend the default playwright `tsconfig.json` beyond
just the currently allowed `compilerOptions` of `baseUrl` and `path`.
I am using playwright to test a charting library in a mono repo and I'd like
the ability to import constants from the library to facilitate testing.
However, any typescript import from outside of the playwright base directory
throws a typescript error.
The current ability to transpile the tests, and whatever else, before running
the playwright tests would work but makes it difficult to store the
screenshots in the desired directory.
I'd like the ability to provide a path to a `tsconfig.json` or extend a
current `tsconfig.json`. I realize this may open up issues errors when
transpiling playwright with an incompatible `tsconfig.json` but there may be a
way to safeguard against this.
