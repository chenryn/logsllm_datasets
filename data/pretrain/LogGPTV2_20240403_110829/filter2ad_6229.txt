ABSTRACT 
The second ACM workshop on cloud data management is held in 
Denver, Colorado, USA on October 12, 2015 and co-located with 
the  ACM  22nd  Conference  on  Computer  and  Communications 
Security (CCS). The main idea of moving-target defense (MTD) 
is to impose an asymmetric disadvantage on attackers by making 
systems dynamic and therefore harder to explore and predict. This 
workshop  seeks  to  bring  together  researchers  from  academia, 
government,  and  industry to report on the latest research efforts 
on moving-target defense, and to have productive discussion and 
constructive debate on this topic. We have constructed an exciting 
program of 12 referred papers and two invited keynote talks that 
will give participants a comprehensive view of emerging research.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The  static  nature  of  current  computing  systems  has  made  them 
easy  to  attack  and  harder  to  defend.  Adversaries  have  an 
asymmetric  advantage  in  that  they  have  the  time  to  study  a 
system, identify its vulnerabilities, and choose the time and place 
of attack to gain the maximum benefit. The idea of moving-target 
defense  (MTD)  is  to  impose  the  same  asymmetric  disadvantage 
on attackers by making systems dynamic and therefore harder to 
explore  and  predict.  With  a  constantly  changing  system  and  its 
ever  adapting  attack  surface,  attackers  will  have  to  deal  with  a 
great  deal  of  uncertainty  just  like  defenders  do  today.  The 
ultimate goal of MTD is to increase the attacker's workload so as 
to  level  the  cybersecurity  playing  field  for  both  defenders  and 
attackers - hopefully even tilting it in favor of the defender. 
2.  SCOPE 
The  theme  of  the  MTD’2015  is  to  address  the  challenges  of 
effective defense in a dynamic changing environment. We solicit

submissions on original research in the broad area of MTD, with 
possible topics such as those listed below. Since MTD research is 
still  in  its  nascent  stage,  the  list  should  only  be  used  as  a 
reference. We welcome all works that fall under the broad scope 
of moving target defense, including research that shows negative 
results. Below are examples of appropriate topics for MTD 2015: 
  MTD Techniques 
o  System randomization 
o  Artificial diversity and system diversification 
o  Bio-inspired MTDs 
o  Dynamic network configuration 
o  Cloud-based  and  Large-scale  MTDs  (using  multiple 
o  Autonomous technologies for MTD 
o  Dynamic compilation 
o  Moving  targets  in  software  coding,  application  APIs 
techniques) 
and virtualization 
  MTD Modeling and Analysis 
MTDs 
o  Analytical models for MTDs 
o  Quantitative  models  and  effective  measurement  of 
o  Theoretic  study  on  modeling  trade-offs  of  using  MTD 
o  Control and game theory aspects of deploying MTDs 
approaches 
  Human, social, and psychology aspects of MTD 
  Other related MTD areas 
3.  WORKSHOP OBJECTIVE 
This workshop seeks to bring together researchers from academia, 
government,  and  industry to report on the latest research efforts 
on moving-target defense, and to have productive discussion and 
constructive  debate  on  this  topic.  It  also  seeks  to  bring  together 
researchers  and  practitioners  from  diverse  research  fields: 
computer 
software,  modeling,  and 
evaluation, etc. to maximize security performance and reduce the 
implementation cost.  
Security is one of the most important research areas. Even though 
increasing research interests are focused in this area, people still 
need a forum to exchange their ideas and results in the emerging 
research area such as MTD. This workshop aims to provide such a 
forum. This workshop also aims to reflect top research progress in 
the attach countermeasure area.

4.  WORKSHOP PROGRAM FORMAT 
The  workshop  is  a  one-day  workshop.  We  have  invited  two 
keynotes, in which Michael Franz from University of California 
Irvine  (UCI)  will  talk  about  software  code  diversity  to  counter 
attacks,  and  Hamed  Okhravi  from  MIT  Lincoln  laboratory  will 
talk  about  how  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness,  benefits,  and 
1709weakness  of  moving  target  techniques.  We  also  accept  eight 
regular  research  papers  and  four  short  research  papers  to  be 
presented  in  the  workshop.  The  presentations  will  be  grouped 
based on topics.   
Ample  time  for  discussion  and  networking  has  been  allocated 
during  breaks  and  lunchtime.    Moreover,  the  speakers  are 
encouraged  to  leave  enough  time  after  their  presentations  for 
questions and discussion. 
5.  CONCLUSIONS 
including  problems  of 
MTD  presents  many  challenges, 
intrusiveness  to  existing  services,  balance  between  security 
strength  and  efficiency,  effective  evaluation  models,  general 
MTD  framework,  and  other  issues.  Other  issues  such  as 
deployment  cost  and  usability  studies  are  also  important.  The 
MTD workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners 
to  exchange  ideas  and  progress  in  moving  target  defense.  We 
have  constructed  an  exciting  program  of  refereed  papers  and 
invited talks that will give participants a comprehensive overview 
of emerging research in this exciting area.
