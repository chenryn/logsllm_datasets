Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple instances of the same software component, chrome.exe, connecting to the same proxy server, proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070, over HTTPS. The connections are opened and closed multiple times, with varying amounts of data sent and received. The lifetime of the connections range from less than one second to two minutes.
