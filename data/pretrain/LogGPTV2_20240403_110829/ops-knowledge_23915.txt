User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Elastix "asterisk -r" command not working "-bash: asterisk: command not found" I'm having trouble administering the current version of Elastix from the command line on a CentOS 6.3 box. I believe the command I'm look for is asterisk -r however I cannot figure out how to access the command line tools on this box as that command returns -bash: asterisk: command not found. Has anyone else encountered such a problem?

Assistant: The kind of functionality I'm looking for can be achieved by accessing the web GUI at http://www.XXXX.com/index.php?menu=tools and entering commands there. 

It is impossible to log into the Elastix box using ssh and then running commands like one would using asterisks. You must use the web GUI.
