User: I'm working on an audio mixing program (DAW) web app, and considering using Python and Python Gstreamer for the backend.  I understand that I can contain the audio tracks of a single music project in a gst.Pipeline bin, but playback also appears to be controlled by this Pipeline.
Is it possible to create several "views" into the Pipeline representing the project?  So that more than one client can grab an audio stream of this Pipeline at will, with the ability to do time seek?
If there is a better platform/library out there to use, I'd appreciate advice on that too.  I'd prefer sticking to Python though, because my team members are already researching Python for other parts of this project.
Thanks very much!
Assistant: You might want to look at Flumotion (www.flumotion.org). It is a python based streaming server using GStreamer, you might be able to get implementation ideas from that in terms of how you do your application. It relies heavily on the python library Twisted for its network handling.
