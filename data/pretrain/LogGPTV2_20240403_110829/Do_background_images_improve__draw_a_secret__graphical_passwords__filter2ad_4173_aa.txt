ABSTRACT 
Draw  a  secret  (DAS)  is  a  representative  graphical  password 
scheme. Rigorous theoretical analysis suggests that DAS supports 
an overall password space larger than that of the ubiquitous textual 
password  scheme.  However,  recent  research  suggests  that  DAS 
users  tend  to  choose  weak  passwords,  and  their  choices  would 
render this theoretically sound scheme less secure in real life. 
In  this  paper  we  investigate  the  novel  idea  of  introducing  back-
ground  images  to  the  DAS  scheme,  where  users  were  initially 
supposed  to  draw  passwords  on  a  blank  canvas  overlaid  with  a 
grid.  Encouraging  results  from  our  two  user  studies  have  shown 
that  people  aided  with  background 
to  set 
significantly more complicated passwords than their counterparts 
using  the  original  scheme.  The  background  images  also  reduced 
other  predictable  characteristics  in  DAS  passwords  such  as 
symmetry  and  centering  within 
the  drawing  grid,  further 
improving  the  strength  of  the  passwords.  We  estimate  that  the 
average  strength  of  successfully  recalled  passwords  in  the 
enhanced  scheme  was  increased  over  those  created  using  the 
original scheme by more than 10 bits. Moreover, a positive effect 
was  observed  with  respect  to  the  memorability  of  the  more 
complex passwords encouraged by the background images.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The  use  of  textual  passwords  (i.e.  alphanumeric  passwords)  for 
user authentication is ubiquitous. However, this common practice 
has some well-known weaknesses. For example, many people find 
it difficult to remember strong passwords, and they tend to choose 
easily memorable passwords that are susceptible to guessing.  
Many  of  the  deficiencies  of  textual  passwords  arise  from  the 
limitations  of  human  memory  [17].  Numerous  cognitive  and 
psychological studies have revealed that people perform far better 
when remembering pictures rather than words: as the saying goes, 
a  picture  is  worth  a  thousand  words.  This  has  inspired  research 
into the design of graphical passwords systems in both the security 
and HCI communities in recent years.  
Draw a Secret [7] is a representative graphical password scheme, 
in which a user’s password is a free-form drawing produced on an 
N × N grid. DAS is alphabet independent and so is accessible to 
users  of  all  languages.  This  scheme  is  particularly  suitable  for 
handheld  devices  such  as  PDAs  due  to  its  ability  to  accept 
graphical input on the screen just as you would write on a piece of 
paper. 
Amongst  various  graphical  password  schemes,  DAS  is  of 
particular interest and worthy of extensive study for the following 
reasons.  First,  in  theory,  DAS  boasts  an  overall  password  space 
(i.e.  total  number  of  possible  passwords)  larger  than  that  of  the 
textual scheme. Second, unlike many graphical schemes, DAS can 
be used not only for user authentication (i.e., to verify the claimed 
identify  of  a  user),  but  also  for  key  generation  (i.e.,  to  use  a 
password to generate a long cryptographic key).  
However, recent research suggests that DAS users might tend to 
pick weak graphical passwords that are vulnerable to the graphical 
dictionary  attack  [12].  That  is,  user  choices  of  their  own 
passwords would render the theoretically sound DAS scheme less 
secure in practice for both user authentication and key generation. 
One proposed solution to harden the DAS passwords was to use a 
method  called  grid  selection  [13]:  a  user  first  selects  an  N  x  N 
drawing grid within a much larger selection grid. Then they zoom 
in  and  create  the  secret  as  per  the  original  DAS  scheme.  The 
location  of  the  chosen  drawing  grid  adds  an  extra  degree  of 
complexity  to  the  password,  as  there  are  thousands  of  possible 
drawing grids within the selection grid. This technique in theory 
could significantly increase the password space by adding up to 16 
bits  to  the  password  space.  To  our  knowledge  no  user  study  of 
grid  selection  has  been  carried  out,  so  it  is  unclear  whether  this 
works  as  well  in  practice  as  expected.  A  well-known  lesson  on 
usable  security,  in  particular  for  password  schemes,  is  that  what 
36 
engineers expect to work and what users actually make work are 
two different things [17].  
In this paper, we present our own solution to this problem, a novel 
variant  of  the  DAS  scheme  which  we  call  BDAS  (Background 
Draw-a-Secret).  In  BDAS,  instead  of  creating  a  password  on  a 
blank  canvas  overlaid  with  a  grid,  a  user  will  first  choose  a 
background image to be overlaid by the grid, and then draw their 
secret  as  in  DAS.  We  aim  to  study  whether  this  variant  will 
enhance  the  original  scheme.  Specifically,  we  are  interested  in 
exploring whether a background image would encourage users to 
choose  more  complicated  passwords,  which  are  usually  less 
vulnerable  to  dictionary  and  other  guess  attacks.  We  are  also 
interested  in  whether  the  background  image  could  aid  users  to 
remember their passwords. 
Our main motivation is as follows. In DAS, it is difficult for a user 
to reconstruct a complex secret on the drawing grid as, clearly, all 
the cells are identical. The cells on the perimeter of the grid appear 
much easier to distinguish, while it is much harder to do the same 
with  the  centremost  cells  due  to  them  being  surrounded  on  all 
sides by identical cells. This can cause problems particularly when 
drawing curved objects that must cut cells accurately. So what if 
re-creation of a secret can be aided by something that reduces the 
confusion, such as a background image? 
The  results  of  our  empirical  studies  are  very  encouraging.  For 
example,  people  using  the  BDAS  scheme  in  our  controlled 
experiments tended to set less predictable and significantly more 
complicated  passwords  than  their  counterparts  using  the  original 
scheme.  Background

memorability:  although  BDAS  users  had  to  remember  more 
complicated  passwords,  their  recall  success  rate  was  about  the 
same as that with DAS users who created simpler passwords.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We briefly review 
the DAS scheme in Section 2. Next we discuss related work and 
elaborate  the  novelty  of  our  BDAS  scheme  in  Section  3.  We 
discuss  in  Section  4  the  choice  of  background  images,  with 
particular attention to its relevance to our experiment design. Then 
in  Sections  5  and  6,  we  report  two  comparative  user  studies  of 
both  the  original  and  extended  DAS  schemes.  In  Section  7,  we 
discuss  our  experimental  results.  Finally  we  draw  some 
conclusions and discuss future work in Section 8.

2. DRAW-A-SECRET: AN OVERVIEW 
In DAS, a password is a picture drawn free-form on a grid of size 
N  ×  N.  Each  grid  cell  is  denoted  by  two-dimensional  discrete 
coordinates (x, y) ∈ [1, N] × [1, N]. A completed drawing, i.e., a 
secret,  is  encoded  as  the  ordered  sequence  of  cells  that  the  user 
crosses  whilst  constructing  the  secret.  Each  time  a  user  lifts  the 
pen from the drawing grid surface, a “pen-up” event is encoded by 
a  distinguished  coordinate  pair  (N+1,  N+1).  Two  secrets  are 
identical  if  the  encoding  is  the  same,  not  the  drawing  itself. 
This allows some margin of error as the drawing created does not 
have  to  be  re-created  precisely.  That  is,  the  encoding  of  a 
particular  secret  has  a  one-to-many  relationship  with  the 
possible drawings it can represent. 
A  secret  is  disallowed  if  it  contains  a  cell  crossing  where  it  is 
difficult  to  ascertain  which  destination  cell  had  been  intended. 
This also extends to a construction coming so close to a grid line 
that it is not obvious what the intended route was. Figure 1 shows 
two routes which would be disallowed by the system.

(b)

grid lines (b) crossing through a cell corner. 
Remembering  the  image  itself  is  not  good  enough  to  login  to  a 
DAS  protected  system.  To  replicate  a  password,  the  user  must 
cross the same cells, in the same order, lifting the pen in the same 
places, and not making any crossings that are difficult to encode. 
The following terminology is critical for understanding the DAS 
scheme.  
A stroke is a sequence of cell crossings bounded at both ends by 
pen-up events, exclusive of the pen-ups themselves. For example, 
the  sequence  Pen-up,  (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),  Pen-up  defines  a  stroke: 
(1,2),  (1,3),  (1,4).  The  length  of  a  stroke  is  the  number  of 
coordinate  pairs  it  contains.  Therefore,  the  above  stroke  has  a 
length of 3.  
Since  a  password  in  the  DAS  scheme  is  a  sequence  of  strokes 
separated by pen-ups, the length of a password is the sum of the 
lengths of its component strokes, exclusive of pen-ups. 
The  number  of  strokes  (i.e.  the  stroke  count)  and  the  password 
length are important security metrics measuring the strength of a 
DAS  password.  A  high  number  of  strokes  or  a  high  password 
length  usually  provides  a  high  level  of  security  as  such  secrets 
reside in a more secure part of the password space.  
The impact of stoke count, password length and drawing grid size 
on  the  DAS  password  space  was  examined  in  [13],  and  it  was 
found that the stroke count matters the most amongst these factors. 
However,  increasing  the  stroke  count  is  not  the  only  way  of 
improving the security of DAS passwords. A low stroke count can 
be compensated for by increasing the password length [12,13]. For 
example,  the  password  space  for  DAS  passwords  with  a  stroke 
count of 4 or less and a password length of 20 is about 2^57 on a 
5×5  grid  (See  Table  2  in  the  extended  version  of  [13]).  This  is 
larger than the number of textual passwords of 8 characters or less 
constructed from the printable ASCII codes (2^53). 
Other  traits  of  strong  DAS  passwords  include  few  trends  of 
symmetry and centering within the drawing grid [12,8]. 
3. RELATED WORK 
The  notion  of  a  “graphical  password”  is  due  to  Blonder  [1].  In 
Blonder’s scheme, a password is created by having the user click 
one or more predetermined positions (‘tap regions’) on an image. 
PassPoints  [15]  extended  this idea  by eliminating  the  predefined 
tap boundaries and allowing arbitrary images to be used. Schemes 
such  as  VisKey  (developed  by a  German  company)  [19] and  V-
GO [20] (developed by Passlogix) use essentially the same idea as 
PassPoints. V-Go alters the idea slightly by, for example, asking 
the  user  to  click  a  location  on  the  image  of  a  room  to  hide  an 
object, or click the order of ingredients to make a cocktail.  
Some intuitive observations of the effects of image choices were 
discussed in [16] for PassPoints. Also in [16], in order to compare 
the effect of different images in this scheme, four everyday images 
were used for creating passwords, and each image was tested with 
a different group of subjects. The results indicated that the choice 
of image did not make any significant difference in PassPoints, in 
terms  of  both  user  performance  (e.g.  in  password  creation  and 
retention) and user perceptions. On the contrary, a recent study [3] 
found that the images used had a significant impact in usability.  
For  example,  the  users  experienced  difficulty  selecting  and 
remembering points on images with few salient areas.   
It might appear that the BDAS scheme is just a trivial combination 
of  the  DAS  scheme  and  the  Blonder-style  systems  such  as 
Passpoints. However, this is not true, as shown by the following 
subtle arguments.   
In all the Blonder-style systems known to us, how a user creates a 
password is directly influenced by the content of the image used in 
the system. All that the user must remember are positions clicked 
and the order of those clicks.   
In BDAS, a background image has a different purpose. As shown 
in  [6],  users  may  be  able  to  remember  what  their  password 
drawings look like, but fail to replicate them in the correct location 
in the grid (since the cells in the grid all look alike). We use the 
image with the grid superimposed over it, expecting the contents 
of  the  image  will  help  users  remember  the  location  of  their 
passwords  in  the  grid,  thus  enhancing  both  human  memorability 
and password complexity.  
In  addition,  Blonder-style  systems  use  the  notion  of  selecting  a 
point  of  interest  in  an  image.  In  BDAS  this  kind  of  approach  is 
possible (and to some extent these dot strokes increase the security 
of  secrets);  however,  on  the  whole  no  areas  of  the  image  are 
explicitly selected. If an area is of interest to a user of BDAS, it 
could  be  used  in  a  number  of  ways  instead  of  touching  it.  For 
instance a user could draw a part of their image next to it, could 
gauge  the  location  of  another  part  of  the  drawing  by  using  its 
position,  or  could  draw  over  it.  We  are  certain  there  are  other 
scenarios not mentioned that would come to light after more study.  
Two  empirical  studies  are  of  direct  relevance.  An  informal  user 
study  of  the  DAS  scheme  was  reported  in  [8].  In  this  study,  16 
computer science students were recruited, and each asked to draw 
a  memorable  DAS  password  on  paper  in  order  to  determine  if 
there are any predictable characteristics in the graphical passwords 
that  people  choose.  The  findings  include  that  30%  of  passwords 
were  symmetric,  80%  were  composed  of  1-3  strokes,  and  86% 
were centred or approximately centred within the grid. However, 
no recall test was conducted in this experiment to check whether 
the passwords chosen by the users were memorable. Goldberg et 
al  [6]  conducted  a  user  study  of  Passdoodles,  i.e.  hand-drawn 
doodle passwords. This scheme is very similar to the DAS scheme 
except that 1) a doodle can be drawn in a number of colors, 2) a 
doodle  may  include  multiple  stokes  placed  anywhere  on  the 
drawing  screen  and  3)  it  appears  that  no  drawing  grid  was 
provided.  Thirteen  subjects  were  recruited  to  participate  in  this 
study,  using  a  paper  prototype  of  the  system.  It  was  found  that 
people could remember complete doodle images as accurately as 
alphanumeric  passwords,  but  they  were  less  likely  to  recall  the 
order in which they drew a doodle than the resulting image.  
More distantly related is work on user choice in two recognition-
based  graphical  password  schemes  [4],  which  shows 
that 
permitting user selection of passwords in schemes like Passfaces 
[2,10] can yield passwords with entropy far below the theoretical 
optimum.  
One final point - graphical passwords is an active research topic; 
due to space limit, some interesting work is not covered here, but 
can be found in a recent survey of this topic in [11]. 
4. BACKGROUND IMAGE CHOICE 
Our idea is to introduce background images to the original DAS 
scheme so that both a background image and the drawing grid can 
be used to provide cued recall. But what images would be suitable 
for  inclusion?  It  is  possible,  in  our  DAS  variant,  that  a  user’s 
drawing  will  be  influenced  by  the  image  that  is  placed  before 
them. For example, the number of ‘hot spots’ (areas of interest) on 
a  background  image  might  influence  the  distribution  of  the 
passwords created, and impose bias in certain areas.  
Unfortunately,  there  is  very  limited  prior  art  on  the  choice  of
