User: Is there any way to call an installed python egg from python code? I need to cal a sphinx documentation
generator from within a python code, and currently i'm doing it like this:
os.system( "sphinx-build.exe -b html c:\\src c:\\dst" )
This works, but requires some additional configuration: 'scripts' folder
inside a python installation folder need to be added to a system PATH
( i'm on Windows ). Is it any better, native way to call an installed python
egg?
Assistant: Adding the egg to PYTHONPATH or to sys.path will allow you to access the modules and packages within.
