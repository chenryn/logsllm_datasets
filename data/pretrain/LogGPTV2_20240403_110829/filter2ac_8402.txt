### Title: BlueRepli: Stealthily Accessing Your Android Phone via Bluetooth Authentication Bypass

Bluetooth, a short-range wireless communication technology, is ubiquitous in Android phones and can be found in numerous devices in public spaces. While Bluetooth offers convenience, it has also been the subject of several security vulnerabilities, such as BlueBorne, KNOB, and BadBluetooth. Today, we introduce another 0-day vulnerability, named BlueRepli (Bluetooth Replicant), which exploits security weaknesses in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and the oversight of some well-known mobile phone manufacturers.

At the application layer, Bluetooth operates with a set of implementation standards known as profiles. These profiles are designed for various complex application scenarios, including:

- **PBAP (Phone Book Access Profile)**: Synchronizes phonebook data.
- **MAP (Message Access Profile)**: Accesses SMS data.
- **SAP (SIM Access Profile)**: Enables remote devices to use local SIM cards.

Access to these profiles by remote devices typically requires explicit user authorization and strict authentication from the local Android phone. However, our research has uncovered two new methods to bypass these security measures and gain unauthorized access to these profiles.

1. **Deceptive Interaction Method**:
   - This method involves a novel attack technique that can obtain profile permissions through a single, highly deceptive interaction with the target device.

2. **BlueRepli 0-Day Vulnerability**:
   - The second method leverages the previously undisclosed 0-day vulnerability, BlueRepli, which allows attackers to gain profile access without any noticeable interaction or user consent.

To demonstrate the potential impact of these vulnerabilities, we have prepared comprehensive video demonstrations. These videos illustrate how an attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities to:

- Steal mobile phone contact information and call history.
- Intercept and steal SMS verification codes.
- Send fake text messages using the compromised phone.

These findings highlight the critical need for robust security measures and prompt updates to protect Android users from such vulnerabilities.
