**ATT&CK ID:** T1070.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** File Deletion

Adversaries may delete files that are created or modified during their intrusion activities to eliminate evidence of their presence and actions. These files can include malware, tools, or other non-native files that were introduced into the system (e.g., via Ingress Tool Transfer). Such files often leave traces that can reveal the nature and extent of the adversary's activities within the network.

File deletion can occur at various stages of the intrusion, either during the active phase or as part of a post-intrusion cleanup process. The primary goal is to minimize the adversary's digital footprint and make it more difficult for defenders to detect and analyze the intrusion.
