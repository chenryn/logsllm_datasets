**Title: Behind the Scenes of Intel's Converged Security and Manageability Engine (CSME)**

**Abstract:**

In recent years, low-level firmware vulnerabilities have gained significant attention due to their high-privilege nature and the robust security measures implemented in modern operating systems. Intel has developed the Converged Security and Manageability Engine (CSME) to address these challenges by establishing a "Root of Trust" from system startup. Over the past few years, continuous improvements have been made to the CSME firmware to mitigate common memory corruption issues and reduce the complexity and privileges of certain firmware modules.

This presentation will delve into the following key areas:

1. **CSME Hardware Overview:**
   - Architecture and design
   - Limitations and associated security challenges

2. **CSME ÂµKernel OS Internals:**
   - Boot process and flow
   - Debugging capabilities
   - Key processes and features

3. **Customization and OEM Role:**
   - Support for customization
   - The role of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the manufacturing process

4. **Recovery and Update Mechanisms:**
   - Strategies for firmware recovery
   - Methods for updating the CSME firmware

5. **Exploitation Mitigations:**
   - Techniques to prevent memory corruption
   - Defense-in-depth strategies

6. **Fuzzing and Monitoring Technologies:**
   - Application of fuzzing techniques
   - Feedback fuzzing and queue management
   - How to apply these technologies in a generic form

We will also share deep technical details on how other firmware environments can achieve similar security outcomes by implementing the same mitigation techniques. Additionally, we will discuss the rationale behind our use of feedback fuzzing and queue management, providing insights that can be applied to any existing fuzzer.

By the end of this presentation, attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of the CSME architecture, its security features, and the best practices for mitigating firmware vulnerabilities.
