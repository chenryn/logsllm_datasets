access-list (standard)
Description Configure a standard Access Control List (ACL) to permit or deny source IP addresses.
Syntax [no] access-list acl-num [seq-num]
{permit | deny | l3-vlan-fwd-disable | remark string}
{any | host host-ipaddr | src-ipaddr {filter-mask | /mask-length}}
[log [transparent-session-only]]
Parameter Description
acl-num Standard ACL number (1-99).
seq-num Sequence number of this rule in the ACL. You can use this option to re-sequence the rules
in the ACL.
permit Allows traffic for ACLs applied to interfaces or used for management access.
For ACLS used for IP source NAT, this option is also used to specify the inside host addresses
to be translated into external addresses.
NOTE: If you are configuring an ACL for source NAT, use the permit action. For ACLs used
with source NAT, the deny action does not drop traffic, it simply does not use the denied
addresses for NAT translations.
deny Drops traffic for ACLs applied to interfaces or used for management access.
l3-vlan-fwd-disable Disables Layer 3 forwarding between VLANs for IP addresses that match the ACL rule.
remark string Adds a remark to the ACL. The remark appears at the top of the ACL when you display it in
the CLI.
NOTE: An ACL and its individual rules can have multiple remarks.
To use blank spaces in the remark, enclose the entire remark string in double quotes. The
ACL must already exist before you can configure a remark for it.
any Denies or permits traffic received from any source host.
host host-ipaddr Denies or permits traffic received from a specific, single host.
src-ipaddr Denies or permits traffic received from the specified host or subnet. The filter-mask speci-
{filter-mask | fies the portion of the address to filter:
/mask-length}
• Use 0 to match.
• Use 255 to ignore.
For example, the filter-mask 0.0.0.255 filters on a 24-bit subnet.
Alternatively, you can use /mask-length to specify the portion of the address to filter. For
example, you can specify “/24” instead “0.0.0.255” to filter on a 24-bit subnet.
log [transparent- Configures the ACOS device to generate log messages when traffic matches the ACL.
session-only]
The transparent-session-only option limits logging for an ACL rule to creation and
deletion of transparent sessions for traffic that matches the ACL rule.
Default No ACLs are configured by default. When you configure one, the log option is disabled by
default.
Mode Configuration mode
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 68
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Usage An ACL can contain multiple rules. Each access-list command configures one rule. Rules
are added to the ACL in the order you configure them. The first rule you add appears at the
top of the ACL.
Rules are applied to the traffic in the order they appear in the ACL (from the top, which is the
first rule, downward). The first rule that matches traffic is used to permit or deny that traffic.
After the first rule match, no additional rules are compared against the traffic.
To move a rule within the sequence, delete the rule, then re-add it with a new sequence
number.
Access lists do not take effect until you apply them.
• To use an ACL to filter traffic on an interface, see the access-list command in the
“Config Commands: Interface” chapter in the Network Configuration Guide.
• To use an ACL to filter traffic on a virtual server port, see “access-list” in the Command
Line Interface Reference for ADC.
• To use an ACL to control management access, see “disable-management” on page109
and “enable-management” on page112.
• To use an ACL with source NAT, see the ip nat inside source command in the
“Config Commands: IP” chapter in the Network Configuration Guide.
The syntax shown in this section configures a standard ACL, which filters based on source IP
address. To filter on additional values such as destination address, IP protocol, or TCP/UDP
ports, configure an extended ACL. (See “access-list (extended)” on page70.)
Support for Non-Contiguous Masks in IPv4 ACLs
A contiguous comparison mask is one that, when converted to its binary format, consists
entirely of ones. A non-contiguous mask, however, contains at least one zero. Table 3 shows
some examples of IPv4 addresses with each of the ACL mask types, a contiguous mask and a
non-contiguous mask. The addresses and masks are shown in both their decimal and binary
formats.
The “F” column indicates the format, decimal (D) or binary (B).

Example The following commands configure a standard ACL and use it to deny traffic sent from sub-
net 10.10.10.x, and apply the ACL to inbound traffic received on Ethernet interface 4:
ACOS(config)#access-list 1 deny 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255
ACOS(config)#interface ethernet 4
ACOS(config-if:ethernet:4)#access-list 1 in
Example The commands in this example configure an ACL that uses a non-contiguous mask, and
applies the ACLto a data interface:
ACOS(config)#access-list 3 deny 172.0.3.0 0.255.0.255
Info: Configured a non-contiguous subnet mask.*
ACOS(config)#access-list 20 permit any
ACOS(config)#show access-list
access-list 3 4 deny 172.0.3.0 0.255.0.255 Data plane hits: 0
access-list 20 4 permit any Data plane hits: 0
ACOS(config)#interface ethernet 1
ACOS(config-if:ethernet:1)#access-list 3 in
Based on this configuration, attempts to ping or open an SSH session with destination IP
address 172.17.3.130 from source 172.16.3.131 are denied. However, attempts from
172.16.4.131 are permitted.
access-list (extended)

and destination IP addresses, IP protocol, and TCP/UDP ports.
