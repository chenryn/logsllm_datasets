ABSTRACT
Recent spates of cyber-attacks and frequent emergence of
applications aﬀecting Internet traﬃc dynamics have made
it imperative to develop eﬀective techniques that can ex-
tract, and make sense of, signiﬁcant communication pat-
terns from Internet traﬃc data for use in network operations
and security management. In this paper, we present a gen-
eral methodology for building comprehensive behavior pro-
ﬁles of Internet backbone traﬃc in terms of communication
patterns of end-hosts and services. Relying on data min-
ing and information-theoretic techniques, the methodology
consists of signiﬁcant cluster extraction, automatic behav-
ior classiﬁcation and structural modeling for in-depth inter-
pretive analyses. We validate the methodology using data
sets from the core of the Internet. The results demonstrate
that it indeed can identify common traﬃc proﬁles as well as
anomalous behavior patterns that are of interest to network
operators and security analysts.

INTRODUCTION
As the Internet continues to grow in size and complex-
ity, the challenge of eﬀectively provisioning, managing and
securing it has become inextricably linked to a deep under-
standing of Internet traﬃc. Although there has been sig-

for high-speed networks at the core of the Internet, devel-
oping a comprehensive understanding of the collected data
remains a daunting task. This is due to the vast quantities
of data, and the wide diversity of end-hosts, applications
and services found in Internet traﬃc. While there exists an
extensive body of prior work on traﬃc characterization on
IP backbones – especially in terms of statistical properties
(e.g., heavy-tail, self-similarity) for the purpose of network
performance engineering, there has been very little attempt
to build general proﬁles in terms of behaviors, i.e., commu-
nication patterns of end-hosts and services. The latter has
become increasingly imperative and urgent in light of wide
spread cyber attacks and the frequent emergence of disrup-
tive applications that often rapidly alter the dynamics of
network traﬃc, and sometimes bring down valuable Inter-
net services. There is a pressing need for techniques that
can extract underlying structures and signiﬁcant communi-
cation patterns from Internet traﬃc data for use in network
operations and security management.
The goal of this paper is to develop a general methodol-
ogy for proﬁling Internet backbone traﬃc that i) not only
automatically discovers signiﬁcant behaviors of interest from
massive traﬃc data, ii) but also provides a plausible in-
terpretation of these behaviors to aid network operators
in understanding and quickly identifying anomalous events
of signiﬁcance. This second aspect of our methodology is
both important and necessary due to voluminous interest-
ing events and limited human resources. For these purposes,
we employ a combination of data mining and information-
theoretic techniques to automatically cull useful informa-
tion from largely unstructured data, and classify and build
structural models to characterize host/service behaviors of
similar patterns.
In our study we use packet header traces collected on In-
ternet backbone links in a tier-1 ISP, which are aggregated
into ﬂows based on the well-known ﬁve-tuple - the source IP
address (srcIP), destination IP address (dstIP), source port
(srcPrt), destination port (dstPrt), and protocol ﬁelds.
Since our goal is to proﬁle traﬃc in terms of communication
patterns, we start with the essential four-dimensional fea-
ture space consisting of srcIP, dstIP, srcPrt and dstPrt.
Using this four-dimensional feature space, we extract clus-
ters of signiﬁcance along each dimension, where each cluster
consists of ﬂows with the same feature value (referred to as
cluster key) in the said dimension. This leads to four collec-
tions of interesting clusters – srcIP clusters, dstIP clusters,
srcPrt clusters, and dstPrt clusters. The ﬁrst two represent
169a collection of host behaviors while the last two represent
a collection of service behaviors.
In extracting clusters of
signiﬁcance, instead of using a ﬁxed threshold based on vol-
ume, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that culls
interesting clusters based on the underlying feature value
distribution (or entropy) in the ﬁxed dimension. Intuitively,
clusters with feature values (cluster keys) that are distinct
in terms of distribution are considered signiﬁcant and ex-
tracted; this process is repeated until the remaining clus-
ters appear indistinguishable from each other. This yields
a cluster extraction algorithm that automatically adapts to
the traﬃc mix and the feature in consideration.
Given the extracted clusters along each dimension of the
feature space, the second stage of our methodology is to
discover “structures” among the clusters, and build com-
mon behavior models for traﬃc proﬁling. For this purpose,
we ﬁrst develop a behavior classiﬁcation scheme based on
observed similarities/dissimilarities in communication pat-
terns (e.g., does a given source communicate with a single
destination or with a multitude of destinations?). For ev-
ery cluster, we compute an information-theoretic measure of
the variability or uncertainty of each dimension except the
(ﬁxed) cluster key dimension, and use the resulting metrics
to create behavior classes. We study the characteristics of
these behavior classes over time as well as the dynamics of
individual clusters, and demonstrate that the proposed clas-
siﬁcation scheme is robust and provides a natural basis for
grouping together clusters of similar behavior patterns.
In the next step, we adopt ideas from structural modeling
to develop the dominant state analysis technique for mod-
eling and characterizing the interaction of features within
a cluster. This leads to a compact “structural model” for
each cluster based on dominant states that capture the most
common or signiﬁcant feature values and their interaction.
The dominant state analysis serves two important purposes.
First, it provides support for our behavior classiﬁcation –
we ﬁnd that clusters within a behavior class have nearly
identical forms of structural models. Second, it yields com-
pact summaries of cluster information which provides inter-
pretive value to network operators for explaining observed
behavior, and may help in narrowing down the scope of a
deeper investigation into speciﬁc clusters. In addition, we
investigate additional features such as average ﬂow sizes of
clusters (in terms of both packet and byte counts) and their
variabilities, and use them to further characterize similar-
ities/dissimilarities among behavior classes and individual
clusters.
We validate our approach using traﬃc data collected from
a variety of links at the core of the Internet, and ﬁnd that our
approach indeed provides a robust and meaningful way of
characterizing and interpreting cluster behavior. We show
that several popular services and applications, as well as
certain types of malicious activities, exhibit stable and dis-
tinctive behavior patterns in terms of the measures we for-
mulate. The existence of such “typical” behavior patterns
in traﬃc makes it possible to separate out a relatively small
set of “atypical” clusters for further investigation. To this
end, we present case studies highlighting a number of clus-
ters with unusual characteristics that are identiﬁed by our
proﬁling techniques, and demonstrate that these clusters ex-
hibit malicious or unknown activities that are worth inves-
tigating further. Thus our technique can become a powerful
tool for network operators and security analysts with ap-
plications to critical problems such as detecting anomalies
or the spread of hitherto unknown security exploits, proﬁl-
ing unwanted traﬃc, tracking the growth of new services or
applications, and so forth.
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
• We present a novel adaptive threshold-based clustering
approach for extracting signiﬁcant clusters of interest
based on the underlying traﬃc patterns.
• We introduce an information-theoretic behavior classi-
ﬁcation scheme that automatically groups clusters into
classes with distinct behavior patterns.
• We develop structural modeling techniques for inter-
pretive analyses of cluster behaviors.
• Applying our methodology to Internet backbone traf-
ﬁc, we identify canonical behavior proﬁles for captur-
ing typical and common communication patterns, and
demonstrate how they can be used to detect interest-
ing, anomalous or atypical behaviors.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 1.1 brieﬂy discusses the related work, and Section 2
provides some background. The adaptive-threshold cluster-
ing algorithm is presented in Section 3.
In Section 4 we
introduce the behavior classiﬁcation and study its tempo-
ral characteristics. We present the dominant state analysis
and additional feature exploration in Section 5, and apply
our methodology for traﬃc proﬁling in Section 6. Section 7
concludes the paper.
1.1 Related Work
Most of the prior work has analyzed speciﬁc aspects of
traﬃc or applied metrics that are deemed interesting a pri-
ori to identify signiﬁcant network events of interest. For
example, [1, 2] focus on eﬃcient techniques for identifying
“heavy-hitters” in one or several dimensions, and [3, 4] focus
on identifying port scans.
[5] studies the behavior of ﬂash
crowds, while [6, 7, 8] focus on analyzing worm and other
exploit activities on the Internet. Research in [9, 10, 11]
applies signal processing and statistical inference techniques
for identifying traﬃc anomalies, mostly from the perspective
of link-level traﬃc aggregate. Signature-based intrusion de-
tection systems such as SNORT [12] or Bro [13] look for well-
known signatures or patterns in network traﬃc, while several
behavior-based anomaly detection systems (see, e.g., [14, 15]
and references therein) have been developed using data min-
ing techniques. In [16], information-theoretic measures are
proposed for evaluating anomaly detection schemes.
Closer to our work, [17] focuses on resource consumption
in network traﬃc, and develops a clustering algorithm that
automatically discovers signiﬁcant traﬃc patterns along one
or multiple dimensions using ﬁxed volume thresholds. The
studies in [18, 19] focus on communication patterns or pro-
ﬁles of applications instead of broader network traﬃc. Con-
current with our work, [20, 21] are most similar in spirit,
and in a sense are complementary, to ours. In [20], the au-
thors study the “host behaviors” (communication patterns)
at three levels, with the objective to classify traﬃc ﬂows us-
ing packet header information only. Arguably, our entropy-
based behavior classiﬁcation and dominant state analysis
provide a formal framework to analyze host behaviors at
functional and application levels. As an extension to their
early work [9, 10], the authors in [21] also use entropy to
characterize traﬃc feature distributions, with emphasis on
detecting network-wide traﬃc anomalies at PoP-level OD
(origin-destination) ﬂows: the PCA-based subspace method
is used to separate “anomalies” from “normal” traﬃc. In
contrast, our objective is to build behavior proﬁles at host
and service levels using traﬃc communication patterns with-
out any presumption on what is normal or anomalous.
2. BACKGROUND AND DATASETS
Information essentially quantiﬁes “the amount of uncer-
tainty” contained in data [22]. Consider a random variable
X that may take NX discrete values. Suppose we randomly
sample or observe X for m times, which induces an empir-
ical probability distribution1 on X, p(xi) = mi/m, xi ∈ X,
where mi is the frequency or number of times we observe X
taking the value xi. The (empirical) entropy of X is then
deﬁned as
H(X) := − Xxi∈X
p(xi) log p(xi)
(1)
where by convention 0 log 0 = 0.
Entropy measures the “observational variety” in the ob-
served values of X [23]. Note that unobserved possibili-
ties (due to 0 log 0 = 0) do not enter the measure, and
0 ≤ H(X) ≤ Hmax(X) := log min{NX , m}. Hmax(X) is
often referred to as the maximum entropy of (sampled) X,
as 2Hmax(X) is the maximum number of possible unique val-
ues (i.e., “maximum uncertainty”) that the observed X can
take in m observations. Clearly H(X) is a function of the
support size NX and sample size m. Assuming that m ≥ 2
and NX ≥ 2 (otherwise there is no “observational variety”
to speak of), we deﬁne the standardized entropy below – re-
ferred to as relative uncertainty (RU) in this paper, as it
provides an index of variety or uniformity regardless of the
support or sample size:
RU (X) :=
H(X)
Hmax(X)
=
H(X)
log min{NX , m} .
(2)
Clearly, if RU (X) = 0, then all observations of X are of
the same kind, i.e., p(x) = 1 for some x ∈ X; thus obser-
vational variety is completely absent. More generally, let A
denote the (sub)set of observed values in X, i.e., p(xi) > 0
for xi ∈ A. Suppose m ≤ NX . Then RU (X) = 1 if and only
if |A| = m and p(xi) = 1/m for each xi ∈ A. In other words,
all observed values of X are diﬀerent or unique, thus the ob-
servations have the highest degree of variety or uncertainty.
Hence when m ≤ NX , RU (X) provides a measure of “ran-
domness” or “uniqueness” of the values that the observed
X may take – this is what is mostly used in this paper, as
in general m (cid:9) NX .
In the case of m > NX , RU (X) = 1 if and only if
mi = m/NX , thus p(xi) = 1/NX for xi ∈ A = X, i.e.,
the observed values are uniformly distributed over X.
In
this case, RU (X) measures the degree of uniformity in the
observed values of X. As a general measure of unifor-
mity in the observed values of X, we consider the condi-
tional entropy H(X|A) and conditional relative uncertainty
RU (X|A) by conditioning X based on A. Then we have
H(X|A) = H(X), Hmax(X|A) = log |A| and RU (X|A) =
1With m → ∞, the induced empirical distribution ap-
proaches the true distribution of X.

H(X)/log|A|. Hence RU (X|A) = 1 if and only if p(xi) =
1/|A| for every xi ∈ A. In general, RU (X|A) ≈ 1 means that
the observed values of X are closer to being uniformly dis-
tributed, thus less distinguishable from each other, whereas
RU (X|A) (cid:9) 1 indicates that the distribution is more skewed,
with a few values more frequently observed. This measure
of uniformity is used in Section 3 for deﬁning “signiﬁcant
clusters of interest”.
We conclude this section by providing a quick descrip-
tion of the datasets used in our study. The datasets consist
of packet header (the ﬁrst 44 bytes of each packet) traces
collected from multiple links in a large ISP network at the
core of the Internet (Table 1). For every 5-minute time slot,
we aggregate packet header traces into ﬂows, which is de-
ﬁned based on the well-known 5-tuple (i.e., the source IP
address, destination IP address, source port number, desti-
nation port number, and protocol) with a timeout value of
60 seconds [24]. The 5-minute time slot is used as a trade-
oﬀ between timeliness of traﬃc behavior proﬁling and the
amount of data to be processed in each slot.
3. EXTRACTING SIGNIFICANT CLUSTERS
We start by focusing on each dimension of the four-feature
space, srcIP, dstIP, srcPrt, or dstPrt, and extract “sig-
niﬁcant clusters of interest” along this dimension. The ex-
tracted srcIP and dstIP clusters yield a set of “interesting”
host behaviors (communication patterns), while the srcPrt
and dstPrt clusters yield a set of “interesting” service/port
behaviors, reﬂecting the aggregate behaviors of individual
hosts on the corresponding ports. In the following we intro-
duce our deﬁnition of signiﬁcance/interestingness using the
(conditional) relative uncertainty measure.
Given one feature dimension X and a time interval T , let
m be the total number of ﬂows observed during the time
interval, and A = {a1, . . . , an}, n ≥ 2, be the set of dis-
tinct values (e.g., srcIP’s) in X that the observed ﬂows
take. Then the (induced) probability distribution PA on
X is given by pi := PA(ai) = mi/m, where mi is the num-
ber of ﬂows that take the value ai (e.g., having the srcIP
ai). Then the (conditional) relative uncertainty, RU (PA) :=
RU (X|A), measures the degree of uniformity in the ob-
served features A. If RU (PA) is close to 1, say, > β = 0.9,
then the observed values are close to being uniformly dis-
tributed, and thus nearly indistinguishable. Otherwise, there
are likely feature values in A that “stand out” from the
rest. We say a subset S of A contains the most signiﬁcant
(thus “interesting”) values of A if S is the smallest subset
of A such that i) the probability of any value in S is larger
than those of the remaining values; and ii) the (conditional)
probability distribution on the set of the remaining values,
R := A − S, is close to being uniformly distributed, i.e.,
RU (PR) := RU (X|R) > β. Intuitively, S contains the most
signiﬁcant feature values in A, while the remaining values
are nearly indistinguishable from each other.
