ABSTRACT
Text passwords have been used in authentication systems for
many decades. Users must recall the textual strings selected
during registration to pass authentication. However, there
are some serious problems with text passwords—recollection
and security. Hence, various graphical-password authenti-
cation systems have been proposed to solve the problems
of text passwords. Previous studies indicate that humans
are better at recognizing and recalling images than texts.
In 2005, Wiedenbeck et al. proposed PassPoints in which
a password consists of a sequence of click-points (5 to 8)
that a user chooses on an image. In the paper, we proposed
an alternative system in which users can memorize fewer
points while providing more security than PassPoints. Based
on the idea of using an extremely large image as the pass-
word space, we propose a novel world map based graphical-
password authentication system called PassMap in which a
password consists of a sequence of 2 click-points that a user
selects on an large world map. We also conducted a user
study for evaluation. The result shows that the passwords
of PassMap are easy to memorize for humans and PassMap
is friendly to use in practice. Furthermore, PassMap pro-
vides higher entropy than PassPoints and also increases the
cost of attacks.

INTRODUCTION
Text passwords have been used in authentication systems
over the past few decades. Users must recall the textual
strings selected during registration to pass the authentica-
tion. However, there are some serious problems with text
passwords. First, users are not experts in memorizing tex-
tual strings, especially strong passwords. Second, in order to
overcome the ﬁrst problem, most users will choose easy-to-
remember or meaningful textual strings as passwords, and
these passwords are weak.
Hence, various graphical-password authentication systems
have been proposed to solve the problems of text passwords
[1, 9, 5, 8, 10, 13], based on previous studies which indi-
cated that humans are better at recognizing and recalling
images than texts [7, 3]. In 2005, Wiedenbeck et al. pro-
posed PassPoints [12] in which a password consists of a se-
quence of click-points (5 to 8) that user chooses in an image.
PassPoints is a well-known and highly discussed graphical-
password system. Graphical passwords not only reduce the
users’ burden of recollection, but also provide a larger pass-
word space, improving both the security and the usability
of authentication systems.
However, we think that it is still diﬃcult to memorize
PassPoints passwords, especially when images are provided
by a server. Thus, we designed an alternative system in
which users can memorize fewer points, while providing more
security than PassPoints.
Based on the idea of using extremely large images as
the password space, we propose a novel world map based
graphical-password authentication system called PassMap
to solve the password recollection and password security
weaknesses of PassPoints. In PassMap, a password consists
of a sequence of 2 click-points that the user selects on a large
world map. We also conducted a user study for evaluation.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT, ATTACK MODEL
AND ASSUMPTIONS
2.1 Problem Statement
The idea of PassMap is to use an extremely huge images
as the password space. However, this idea has some prob-
lems in practice. First, the display size of normal devices
is limited so the displays cannot show a whole image, and
users must drag the image to ﬁnd their points. This may be
time-consuming and inconvenient. Second, it is diﬃcult for
users to memorize points when using extremely huge images
even fewer points should be selected. Therefore, we want
to solve the problems of: 1) password recollection and pass-
word security of PassPoints; 2) using extremely huge images
as the password space in graphical-password authentication
systems.
2.2 Attack Model
We model the threats faced in graphical-password authen-
tication systems. Attacks are classiﬁed as brute force and
pattern dictionary attacks.
Brute Force Attacks The attackers can try all elements
in the password space, by imitating the clicking or other ac-
tions of mouses. If time and processing power are unlimited,
attackers can ﬁnd all possible passwords. However, it is con-
strained in practice by time, computing power and password
space size.
Pattern Dictionary Attacks Based on previous researches
[4, 11], users’ choices are predictable in most cued-recall
based systems [2], so attackers can make use of this prop-
erty. Attackers ﬁrst collect images used by authentication
systems, then process and analyze the images to obtain the
hotspots and patterns. Hotspots are the points or areas
of an image that has a higher probability to be chosen by
users as click-points, and patterns are the shapes composed
of click-points of an image in a password. Hence, attackers
can try all hotspots or patterns with higher probability to
crack the authentication systems.
2.3 Assumptions
In this study, we have two assumptions. First, we as-
sume that any communication of our authentication system
is protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer), so packets or
information are not eavesdropped or intercepted by attack-
ers in the transmissions. Second, we assume that the com-
puters or devices in our authentication system are trusted.
This means that the devices are not aﬀected by malicious
softwares, e.g., viruses, worms, or Trojan horse softwares.
These malicious softwares may record keyboard inputs, cap-
ture mouse actions, record screen shots or exploit software
vulnerabilities to bypass the authentication. This assump-
tion is the basis of most authentication systems.
3. THE PROPOSED SCHEME
We propose a graphical-password authentication system
called PassMap to solve password recollection and password
security of PassPoints. In PassMap, a password consists of a
sequence of 2 click-points that a user selects in a huge world
map. Fig. 1 shows a possible password pair in which the ﬁrst
click-point (red point) is nearby Taipei 101 and the second
click-point (red point) is at New York Central Park. We use
an extremely huge image as our password space; hence, users
can memorize fewer click-points, and the password space is
much larger than PassPoints.
The world map has various zoom levels, showing various
contents and information of diﬀerent levels. Fig. 2 is an
example. With high zoom levels, a whole world map is a
huge image; with low zoom levels, an image of world map
is relatively small. Hence, we can advanced place the world
map with moderate size and lower zoom levels in displays of
devices, so users can drag or move the map to some selected
areas quickly, then zooming up the map. Repeating these
actions until the image of world map is huge enough as a
password space and choosing the click-points from that. Fur-
thermore, compared to the arbitrary images, humans have
their own feelings or memories about some positions on the
world map, e.g., their home, old schools, somewhere they
traveled or scenic spots. Hence, even on the lower zoom
levels, users can arrive at selected areas quickly and accu-
rately in password space by dragging and zooming, and they
can memorize the click-points more easily in this password
space.

system. First click-point (red point) is nearby Taipei
101, and second one (red point) is at New York Cen-
tral Park.

map with diﬀerent zoom levels.
3.1 PassMap
In PassMap graphical-password authentication system, there
are two usage phases: the registration phase and the login
phase. We will describe the procedure of these two phases
in details and discuss password resetting later.
Registration Phase
In this phase, users will create their
PassMap accounts and passwords. They will need to use
these credentials to login later. The following is the complete
procedure:
1. User inputs his account and other speciﬁc personal in-
formation, e.g., name, age, e-mail, into the graphical
user interfaces provided by PassMap.
2. Then, the user can shift the world map to selected
areas, and zoom the map to the desired zoom level.
Finally, he chooses 2 points as his passwords. User
can zoom out on the map for re-selection or search
some places directly via the search function.
3. Next is password conﬁrmation. A user repeats step 2
to try to ﬁnd the 2 points that he selected in the ﬁrst
time. If the conﬁrmation fails, this registration will be
terminated.
4. PassMap discretizes the world map at the beginning
of the phase, then records the discretized information
of the click-points selected in step 2 and 3, i.e., safe
tolerance squares and corresponding grids, and hashes
this data representing click-points as the password.
5. Finally, PassMap stores the account, the hashed pass-
word and other personal information in the database.
This completes the registration phase.
Login Phase
words created during the registration phase to log into PassMap.
The following is the complete procedure:
In this phase, users use accounts and pass-
1. The user inputs his account in the graphical user in-
terfaces provided by PassMap.
2. The user tries to click the 2 points selected in the reg-
istration phase. The user can shift the world map to
his selected areas, zoom in on the map to the speciﬁc
zoom level, and choose his 2 points. User can zoom out
on the map for re-selection or search places directly.
3. PassMap fetches the hashed password of that account
received from database, compares it with the hashed
password received from the client. If the comparison is
identical, this login attempt passes the authentication,
otherwise it will be terminated. This completes the
login phase.
Resetting Passwords
In many situations, users may
want to change their passwords. PassMap also provides
mechanisms for resetting passwords. First, users should log
into PassMap, then they must follow step 2 to step 5 in
the registration phase. They will have a new password after
doing so.
Another consideration is that users may forget their pass-
words. Many solutions have been proposed. For example,
users can reset their passwords by answering their personal
questions or receive new passwords sent from systems via the
e-mail addresses recorded during registration. All of these
mechanisms are suitable to be implemented with PassMap.

IMPLEMENTATION AND USER STUDY
We implemented a prototype of PassMap graphical-password
authentication system, and conducted a user study.
4.1 Implementation
We built a website as a prototype of our PassMap. Users
can connect to the system to register accounts and log into
websites via web browsers. In the scheme mentioned above,
the world map data should be stored on the server of PassMap,
and clients request the parts of the world map. However,
for convenience, we directly used the world map provided
by Google Maps. On the client side of our implementation,
we used JavaScript and Google Maps API to fetch the real-
time world map data and implement drag, zoom in, zoom
out, and search functions in the web browsers.
In our prototype, we embedded a 640 × 420 pixel frame
block for displaying the world map in a web page. The initial
size of world map is at zoom level 8 of Google Maps, i.e.,
216
× 216 pixel, and the center is at Taiwan. We overwrote
the zoom in and zoom out functions of Google Maps API, in
order to reduce operation time, from zoom level 8, 12, 16 to
18. The search function will shift the map to speciﬁc areas
and set the zoom level to level 18 directly. Our passwords
space is a 226
× 226 pixel image with zoom level 18 of Google
Maps. Furthermore, we used satellite-type map instead of
road map to increase information objects which users can
select as passwords.
4.2 User Study
We introduce our user study including the design, partici-
pants, and procedures to evaluate the accuracy and usability
of PassMap.
Design
In the user study, we want to test two things
about PassMap: the ﬁrst is the users’ recollection, which
is a user’s ability to remember his passwords after a time
period; the second is the usability of PassMap, including
total time exhausted and the number of functions which
are used to control the world map. The usability indicates
that whether users are diﬃcult or time-consuming to use
PassMap.
In order to analyze the users’ recollection, participants
must ﬁrst register for accounts using PassMap and try to
log into the system one week later. We divide the usages
of PassMap into three phases in this user study: the regis-
tration phase, the conﬁrmation phase and the login phase.
In the registration phase, participants create accounts and
passwords using PassMap. We measure the total time and
the number of drag, zoom ins, zoom outs, and searches used
in this phase. Furthermore, we also record the participants’
birthplaces and residences for later analysis. We then deﬁne
a login or conﬁrmation attempt so that participants can try
to login or conﬁrm their accounts unless they fail six times.
If they failed to login after six times in an attempt, this at-
tempt will be marked as failed. In the conﬁrmation/login
phase, participants have one conﬁrmation/login attempt.
We also record the total time, the number of drags, zoom
ins, zoom outs and search functions used and the number of
failures given one conﬁrmation/login attempt. Moreover, in
order to test recollection after a long time period, we asked
participants to do third test after six weeks without any pre-
vious notiﬁcation. We believe that third test will reﬂect the
users’ true behaviors and recollection because they are given
no notiﬁcation or preparation. In the third test, participants
also have one login attempt.
Participants There are a total of 27 participants (9 fe-
males and 18 males) in the ﬁrst and second tests. All are
students of an university. However, because of no previous
notiﬁcation, only 19 participants returned to do the third
test. In the user study, we required participants to be ex-
perienced computer users and surf the Internet frequently.
The education level of the participants vary from Ph.D. stu-
dent to students pursuing their Bachelor’s degree. 21 of the
participants majored in computer science. The average age
is 23.96 years (SD = 3.09), and the range is from 19 to 32.
5. COLLECTED RESULTS
We analyze the data collected in the user study mentioned
above. Accuracy is measured by the success rate of conﬁr-
mation/login after one week and six weeks. We use this re-
sult to make conclusion about users’ password recollection.
Usability is measured by the total time and the number of
functions used in every phase of the user study. Based on
this data, we think that PassMap is suitable to build and
