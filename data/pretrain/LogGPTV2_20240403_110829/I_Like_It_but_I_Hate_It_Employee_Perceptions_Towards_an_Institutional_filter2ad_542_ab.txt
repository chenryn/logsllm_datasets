### The Pennsylvania State University's Kerberos Single Sign-On Service

The Pennsylvania State University employs a Kerberos single sign-on (SSO) service, which allows authorized users to authenticate once per session on a per-device basis for all university services. Once the session expires, typically when all browser windows are closed, users must re-authenticate via the SSO service to access university resources again.

In the original two-factor authentication (2FA) system for faculty and staff, a physical Vasco token was required as an additional security step for accessing two critical systems: the employee scheduling and grading system, and the employee payment portal. After entering their username and password, users had to enter a six-digit code from the Vasco token into a web browser before the code expired. These tokens were not always carried by faculty and staff, often being left in a secure location such as a home or work desk drawer.

### Transition to DuoMobile

The implementation of DuoMobile introduced a new digital second-factor authentication method and also modified the Kerberos SSO service. Instead of using a token or app only for one or two critical systems, the transition to DuoMobile mandated a second-factor entry for each authentication into the SSO system. This change meant that all users, regardless of the chosen authentication method, would use their second factor more frequently.

#### 2.4.1 DuoMobile Enrollment

The rollout of the new 2FA service, DuoMobile, occurred over a year. In May 2015, employees were given the option to start using DuoMobile at their discretion. Those who did not want to enroll could continue using the token-based system. Starting in the fall of 2015, the Office of Information Security began enforcing the DuoMobile rollout on a department-by-department basis. This phased approach allowed the office to manage the necessary resources and limit the number of issues at any given time.

Students and graduate students were not required to enroll in DuoMobile due to administrative concerns about potential backlash. The argument was that students and faculty/staff represent distinct populations: students pay to attend the university, while faculty and staff are employed by it. Administrators were hesitant to impose this change on all network users, especially since students might view it as an infringement on their personal devices.

For each department, emails were sent weeks in advance to encourage early enrollment. Departments were given a final cutoff date, after which unenrolled employees would be directed to the DuoMobile enrollment page upon attempting to log in. This process continued until the final deployment in May 2016, by which time all faculty and staff were enrolled in DuoMobile.

The enrollment process involved three steps:
1. **Selecting the Enrollment Method:** Users could choose between a mobile phone (recommended), tablet, Duo Token (a physical 2FA token), or a landline.
2. **Providing Device Details:** For a mobile phone, users entered their phone number and operating system. For a tablet, they selected the operating system. Users could also purchase a standard 2FA token for $22, though none of our participants opted for this.
3. **Registering the Landline:** If choosing a landline, users provided the phone number and extension, if applicable.

#### 2.4.2 DuoMobile Use Case Scenarios

With the newly implemented DuoMobile system, the authentication process evolved. Upon logging in to a university system using the SSO service, users are presented with a screen to provide additional authentication. They have three options:
1. **Duo Push:** A responsive notification is pushed to their device, requiring them to click "Approve" or "Deny."
2. **Automated Phone Call:** An automated call is made to a registered device, and the user must press a key to verify the login.
3. **Pre-Generated Passcode:** Users can receive a list of passcodes via SMS or use previously generated spare codes.

These options were designed to accommodate both smartphone and feature phone users, ensuring that employees could authenticate in various scenarios, including international use.

### 3. Methodology

To understand the design, implementation, and employee response to the new BYOD 2FA system, we conducted an online study to elicit beliefs and opinions about 2FA and the DuoMobile system.

#### 3.1 Online Survey

The primary instrument, a survey, was distributed after the DuoMobile rollout, ensuring that 100% of faculty and staff were using the system. The survey covered usability, security, and privacy, drawing on previous literature [14, 25, 57] for its conceptual foundation.

##### 3.1.1 Measuring Usability

We measured perceived ease of use, relative advantage, and compatibility using validated scales [44]. These measures allowed us to compare the token and DuoMobile systems independently and in relation to each other.

##### 3.1.2 Measuring Security/Privacy Considerations

We included questions about the security of individuals' phones, general security mindset, and mobile security and privacy habits, such as app purchase habits, password security, and use of 2FA outside of work.

##### 3.1.3 Participant Recruitment

Participant recruitment involved contacting college and department heads for permission to distribute the survey. Potential participants were given the option to follow a link to the Qualtrics-hosted survey. All participants reviewed and signed an electronic consent form. The survey was designed to protect participant identity and ensure no coercion. The study was approved by the Pennsylvania State University’s IRB.

#### 3.2 Participants

The survey was distributed to a cross-section of faculty and staff, excluding undergraduate and graduate students. Professions included social, natural, and formal sciences, as well as medical professionals. The target population pool contained approximately 800-1040 people, with 192 individuals completing the survey. The overall response rate was estimated to be 17-13%, with a completion rate of 69.7% for the sub-population. High dropout rates (30.3%) were attributed to the survey length, and dropouts were less likely to find 2FA technologies beneficial.

### 4. Results

#### 4.1 Mobile Device Usage

Participants primarily used Apple’s iOS (64.5%) and Android (35.5%). The type of mobile phone did not affect perceived usability, relative advantage, or compatibility. Most participants (96%) used the DuoMobile app, with only 6 (4%) using alternative methods like phone calls. The majority (95.5%) owned a smartphone, and 74% used some form of security feature on their devices.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the adoption and usage of the DuoMobile system at Pennsylvania State University, highlighting the importance of usability, security, and privacy considerations in the implementation of 2FA systems.
