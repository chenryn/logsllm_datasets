The Pennsylvania State University utilizes a Kerberos single sign-
on service [43] which allows authorized users on the network to
authenticate to all university services once per session on a per-
device basis. Once this session has expired, i.e., all browser windows
have been closed, a user wanting to utilize university services would
need to re-authenticate via the single sign-on service. Within the
original 2FA system for faculty and staff, a physical Vasco token
was required as an additional security step before authorizing two
critical systems behind the Kerberos sign-on service: an employee
scheduling and grading system, and the employee payment portal.
Upon accessing one of these systems with a username and password,
a user would be required to use their Vasco token, and type in
the six-digit code on the device into a textbox in a web browser
before the code expired. These tokens did not necessarily have to be
accessible to faculty and staff at all times, and many did not carry
the token on them; preferring to leave the token in a single safe
space, such as a home or work desk drawer.
The implementation of DuoMobile not only introduced a new
means of authenticating with a digital second-factor, but also cre-
ated changes to the Kerberos sign-on service. Instead of only need-
ing to use a token or app to authenticate within one or two critical
systems on the campus network, the transition to DuoMobile was
also accompanied by a mandated second-factor entry for each au-
thentication into the single sign-on system. This meant that regard-
less of the authentication method selected, all users of the system
would be utilizing their second factor far more often.
2.4.1 DuoMobile Enrollment. The rollout of this new 2FA ser-
vice took place over the course of a year. In May 2015, employees
were invited for the first time to begin using the service at their
own discretion. Employees who did not want to enroll at that time
were permitted to continue using their token-based system. Begin-
ning in the fall of 2015, the Office of Information Security began
enforcing the DuoMobile rollout on a department-by-department
basis. By rolling out the service in this way, the office anticipated
to be able to scale the resources required for the service appropri-
ately, as well as limit the number of people who could have issues
with the service at any given time. Students and graduate students
were not required to enroll in DuoMobile due to administrative
concerns about backlash from students who may feel that such an
action would be the university infringing upon their own devices.
The argument was also presented that students and faculty/staff
represent two distinct populations at a university; one group pays
money to attend a university, and the other is employed by the
university. As students in many cases would not be considered to
be employed by, or indebted to, a university, administrators were
hesitant to implement this change for all network users.
When it came time for each department to enroll, emails were
sent weeks ahead of time in an attempt to encourage employees to
enroll well before the deadline. If employees did not enroll early,
each department was issued a final cutoff date. After that date, upon
attempting to log in, all employees in that department would be
directed to the DuoMobile enrollment page, as shown in Appendix
A.2, and would be unable to log in to their accounts until they signed
up for the service. This enrollment process proceeded periodically,
until the final deployment occurred in May of 2016. At that time, all
faculty and staff at the university were enrolled in the DuoMobile
service if they were not already.
The enrollment procedures consisted of a 3-step process. Step
1 asked new users to select how they would like to enroll in Duo-
Mobile. Advertised options included Mobile Phone (recommended),
Tablet, Duo Token (a physical 2FA token), or a Landline. If opting
for a mobile phone, users were then presented with a screen, and
were required to enter their mobile phone number and what operat-
ing system their mobile phone used. If selecting a tablet, users were
required to select the operating system of that tablet. Interestingly,
and perhaps intentionally less advertised by the transition team,
employees and staff were given the option to purchase a standard
2FA token that would be compatible with DuoMobile for a one-time
fee of $22. If a DuoMobile Token would ever be misplaced, it would
again be the employee’s responsibility to purchase an additional
unit. It is worth noting that none of our participants opted to pur-
chase a DuoMobile token, though it is possible faculty and staff in
areas other than we surveyed may have done so. Finally, if choosing
to enroll a landline phone, users were required to provide a phone
number and an extension, if applicable.
2.4.2 DuoMobile Use Case Scenarios. Within the newly imple-
mented DuoMobile system (shown in Appendix A.3), the authen-
tication process evolved. Upon logging in to a desired university
system using proper credentials on the single sign-on service, users
are presented with a screen in their web browser to provide ad-
ditional authentication. Using this screen, they have 3 options: 1)
Use ’Duo Push’ to push a responsive notification to their device,
2) Receive an automated phone call to a registered device, and 3)
Enter a passcode from a pre-composed list which could be solicited
via SMS. These three options were designed to satisfy smartphone
and feature phone users alike.
In the recommended ’Duo Push’ scenario, users would receive a
notification on their phone (or smart watch) informing them that a
login attempt is occurring. The user must simply click “Approve”
or “Deny” to continue the authentication process. In the event that
the user approves the ’push’, the response is subsequently received
by the web browser, and the user becomes fully authenticated.
If choosing to receive an automated phone call, users are con-
tacted on a registered device, whether it be a landline or smartphone,
and are presented with a verbal message. They are then required
to press a dial key on the phone after the message has been played
to verify that they wish to log in to their account. Lastly, if a user
chooses to use a pre-generated passcode, they are directed to either
send a SMS containing 10 passcodes to their mobile phone (and
then enter the first code, with the 9 others being spares for later),
or enter one of their previously generated spare codes. The system
was designed to accommodate a wide range of users, including
employees who may still use landlines. The service works inter-
nationally, and the three authentication methods are designed to
create a scenario in which it is highly unlikely an employee would
not be able to authenticate in some fashion.
3 METHODOLOGY
To understand the design, implementation, and employee response
surrounding a novel two-factor, BYOD system, we conducted an on-
line study designed to elicit beliefs and opinions held by employees
at Penn State about two-factor authentication, generally, as well as
how they perceived the novel DuoMobile system.
3.1 Online Survey
Our primary instrument, a survey, was distributed following the
completion of the DuoMobile roll-out at the university, indicating
that at the time of survey deployment, 100% of faculty and staff
were utilizing the system (it was not an option to opt-out, and
users were enrolled automatically). Utilizing this survey, we were
able to simultaneously carry out a high-level, comparative usability
evaluation, focused on differences between physical and digital
two-factor authentication methods, as well as measure the security
and privacy considerations of members of the university with ad-
ditionally included questions. Technology usability survey studies
have been conducted in previous literature [14, 25, 57], and served
as a conceptual foundation for the work we wanted to conduct.
The survey was quite comprehensive, covering multiple facets of
usability, security, and privacy. The specifics of these measurements
are detailed in the following section.
3.1.1 Measuring Usability. In the scope of this study, we were
presented with a unique opportunity to not only analyze a new
two-factor authentication system, but to complete a comparative
usability analysis of two technologies as well. In order to capture
the relevant data, we first chose to measure perceived ease of use,
as developed by Moore et al., as a means to compare, generally,
the degree to which the token or DuoMoble system was easy to
learn and use [44]. In addition, we sought to capture the relative
advantage, or the measure of a degree to which any technological
innovation is perceived as being better than its precursor [44, 50],
as a means for our participants to make comparisons between Duo-
Mobile and the older token. Finally, we measured compatibility,
or the degree to which using either the token or DuoMobile was
compatible with, or required change, in our participants’ job func-
tions [44]. After consideration, these respective scales were settled
on as they allowed us to measure perceptions of each technology
(the token and the DuoMobile app) independent of each other, but
also in comparison to each other. These scales have been utilized
and referenced in a higher number of technology adoption models
within institutions since its original in 1991, with Google Scholar
indicating over 7000 citations at the time of this writing.
Each of our usability measures were based on pre-developed and
validated scales, and are shown in Table 1 [44]. Scales for all items
were on a 5-point Likert-Style scale, with a 1 indicating ’Strongly
Disagree’ and 5 being ’Strongly Agree’.
3.1.2 Measuring Security/Privacy Considerations. As we had
previously conducted conversations to understand the decision-
making process of the institution in rolling out DuoMobile, we
also sought to understand how employees perceived this change
across a variety of topics. These included BYOD-specific questions
focused on the security of individuals’ phones, as well as the security
considerations relative to both individuals and the institution. We
also worked to understand the general security mindset of the
participants, and queried them about their mobile security and
privacy habits including: app purchase habits, pin-code/password
security, use of two-factor authentication outside of work, and
app privacy settings, among others. We will comment on these
questions more in Section 4.
3.1.3 Participant Recruitment. Participant recruitment was a
multi-step process. Due to the size of the university, it was deemed
that reaching out to all faculty and staff members simultaneously
across the entire college would be viewed as “spammy”, and a mis-
use of university resources. In coordination with the Assistant CISO,
we were permitted to contact individual college and department
heads to ask for permission to distribute a link to our survey. These
college and department heads, at their discretion, would then ei-
ther permit us to distribute (or not) our survey materials to their
faculty and staff. Upon receiving an email containing a description
of the research project and survey from the researchers, potential
participants were given the option to follow a link to the survey,
hosted on the Qualtrics survey platform. Before completing any
part of the survey, all participants were required to review consent
documentation and sign an electronic implied consent to partici-
pate.
The construction of the survey and survey distribution was de-
signed to protect the identity of the survey-takers, and to not create
an environment in which an employee would feel coerced to take
part in the study. To accomplish this, we retained control over any
data collected, and heads of colleges/departments were not given
any access to our data. We also handled all communications directed
at participants ourselves, with no intervention by administrators, or
college/department heads. Additionally, we did not offer any form
of financial or work-based rewards for completing the survey, and
rather relied on intrinsic motivation to participate in the survey.
Responses collected from our survey-takers were also anonymous,
helping to further ensure that no positive or negative organizational
consequences could befall a participant for taking part in the survey.
Lastly, our study was approved by the Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity’s Internal Review Board (IRB), which also considers ethical
aspects regarding participation in research studies.
3.2 Participants
To conduct our study, we distributed a survey to a cross-section
of the faculty and staff population at the university. Again, this
did not include undergraduate or graduate students, though this
group may eventually be required to transition to 2FA as well as
a means to further strengthen the security of the university net-
work. Professions generally included members of social, natural,
and formal sciences, as well as medical professionals. Specifically,
this included the colleges of Health & Human Development, Engi-
neering, Nursing, and Earth & Mineral Sciences. These population
pools represented departments which permitted us to deploy the
survey, and also was an attempt to best represent differing views
of participants across a range of professions to make our results
more generalizable, as different colleges may have different organi-
zational requirements [60]. An example of this would be that the
College of Nursing must abide by further medical (technology) laws
and regulations, that would not apply to an individual working out
of the College of Engineering, such as HIPAA regulations [8].
Each of the colleges surveyed contained ∼200-260 faculty and
staff with varying roles including educators, researchers, and sup-
port staff. This indicates that our overall target population pool for
this study contained ∼800-1040 people. A total of 192 individuals
took part in the study, which took 26 minutes, on average, to com-
plete. 58 participants were excluded from the final analysis due to
failure to complete portions of the survey. Based on this, we estimate
that the total response rate for our survey was ∼17% optimistically,
and ∼13% at worst for the overall population. The completion rate
for the sub-population that participated in our study was 69.7%.
Before removing incomplete survey results (dropouts), completion
percentages for the entire population on either end of the response
rate spectrum would be 8% higher (∼21-25%).
While the high dropout rate (30.3%) could be generally attributed
to the length of the survey, we also ran comparative tests between
groups to determine whether there were any differences between
those who completed the survey and those who did not. Our anal-
ysis of the dropout responses revealed that participants who did
not finish the survey were less likely to find 2FA technologies to
be beneficial (t(86)=-8.635, p<.001), to understand potential secu-
rity benefits of 2FA technologies (t(87)=-6.741, p<.001), to believe
that 2FA technologies make their data more secure (t(89)=-8.174,
p<.001), or to believe that 2FA technologies make their workplace
more secure (t(97)=-9.378, p<.001). It could be that these partici-
pants’ predisposition to having negative feelings towards 2FA tech-
nologies influenced their decision to withdraw from the survey
before completing it. However, we did not find any evidence that
the drop-outs would be specifically biased for or against any of
the two technologies which we study. Of the 134 who successfully
completed the survey, 31 reported as male, with 101 reporting as
female. 2 participants reported their gender as ’fluid’. The average
age of our participants was 45.7 years (SD=11.6).
4 RESULTS
In the following section, we present results from the survey analysis.
We first report on general practices of mobile device usage of the
participants, as well as their perceptions about 2FA technologies.
We then conduct a usability analysis between the previous, more
traditional, security token, and the newly introduced DuoMobile ap-
plication. Finally, we discuss post-adoption concerns shared by our
participants via survey responses, as well as open-ended questions.
4.1 Mobile Device Usage
To begin our analysis, we first sought to understand the breakdown
of mobile phone use by the participants; specifically, which operat-
ing systems were being used on their devices. We found that 64.5%
of the mobile phone users were running a version of Apple’s iOS,
and 35.5% of the participants were utilizing Android devices. How-
ever, we found that the type of mobile phone used did not have any
impact on perceived usability, relative advantage, or compatibility.
To continue our analysis, we addressed the issue of determining
how many of the participants used the DuoMobile app, as well as
what number of participants took alternative means (i.e., SMS codes,
phone calls, etc.). It was found that our participants dominantly
utilized the DuoMobile app, with only 6 participants (4%) taking
an alternative means of authentication within the new DuoMobile
system. Of these 6 participants, each of them had opted to use the
phone calling system, rather than any other form of authentication.
Potentially due to the limited number of non-DuoMobile app users,
it was found that there was no interaction between which Duo-
Mobile authentication method was used in regards to perceived
usability, relative advantage, or compatibility.
Continuing to refine our understanding of this participant pool,
we collected responses about the participants’ mobile device secu-
rity to determine how variations in smartphone use could influence
reported usability, relative advantage, and compatibility. Of the
participants, it was found that 95.5% of them owned a smartphone.
Beyond this, we also measured the enabled (or not disabled) security
features on each of these devices. This was critically important, as
a phone must be unlocked/authenticated within the local operating
system for employees to use the second-factor authentication app.
Of the smartphone-owning participants, 74% used some form of
