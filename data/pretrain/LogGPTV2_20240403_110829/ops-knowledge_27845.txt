User: I have an existing app that uses the deprecated Python 2.5 and the deprecated master/slave datastore. According to the docs, I must migrate the datastore to HRD before I can upgrade to Python 2.7. Before I can migrate my M/S datastore to HRD, I need to do some work on the app and test it using the dev server. 
However, I upgraded to the most recent version of the SDK (1.8.6), and it does not support Python 2.5. Somebody else encountered this problem and learned that the latest SDK that supports Python 2.5 by default is Python SDK 1.7.5. From where can that be downloaded? Or, is there a way I can make the SDK 1.8.6 work with Python 2.5?
Assistant: In the 1.8.6 SDK, there's an old_dev_appserver.py that works with Python 2.5. That'll help you along as you migrate.
