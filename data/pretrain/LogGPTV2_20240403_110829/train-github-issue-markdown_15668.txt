Regardless of the ongoing debate about the merits and drawbacks of a Byte Order Marker (BOM), there are instances where software that processes files generated by Atom requires the presence of a BOM. Therefore, it would be beneficial to include an option in the encodings menu to add or remove the BOM.

Additionally, if a file contains a BOM, it should not be displayed as it currently is. When saving a file, the BOM should remain intact to avoid accidental deletion by users who may mistake it for an extra space, or modification by auto-indentation features.
