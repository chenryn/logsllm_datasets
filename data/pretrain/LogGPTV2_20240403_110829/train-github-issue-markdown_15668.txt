Leaving aside all arguments about whether a Byte Order Marker is a good thing
or a bad thing (I don't much care) there are situations in which software
which will be reading the files produced by atom require it to be there. This
should be an option in the encodings menu.
Further if a Byte Order Mark is present in a file, it should not be displayed
(it currently is), and should be kept in its current state when saving a file
(it can be deleted by an unknowing user who thinks it is an extra space, or
mangled by auto-indent).
