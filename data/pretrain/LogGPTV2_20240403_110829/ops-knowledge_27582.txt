User: Please explain what DNS is and provide a way to manually modify DNS servers.
Assistant: DNS (Domain Name System) is a distributed database system for domain name resolution on the Internet, which converts domain names into corresponding IP addresses so that computers can communicate with each other. The method of manually modifying the DNS server is as follows: 1. Open the control panel and find the "Network and Sharing Center" (different systems may have some differences). 2. Find the currently connected network and click "Change Adapter Settings". 3. Right click on the network and select "Properties". 4. Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" on the property page, and then click "Properties". 5. In the pop-up window, select "Use the following DNS server address", then fill in the corresponding DNS address, and click "OK". Commonly used DNS servers are 8.8.8.8 and 114.114.114.114. 6. If necessary, modify the DNS server address in "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)" accordingly.
