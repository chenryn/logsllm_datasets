## Abstract
Is it possible for attackers to spoof commands to electronic building access systems without needing an authentication medium? This presentation explores the vulnerabilities in networked building access systems, particularly focusing on TCP sequence prediction.

## Introduction
### Who Am I?
- **Name:** Ricky Lawshae

- **Certifications:** OSCP, GPEN
- **Position:** Network Technician at Texas State University
- **Experience:** Many years of experience with electronic building access systems

## Background
### Security Focus
- Traditionally, security testing for building access systems has focused on:
  - ID cards
  - RFID
  - Magnetic stripe cards
  - Biometrics
- With the increasing use of networked building access systems, more attention needs to be given to the security of the controllers themselves.
- Common vulnerabilities include:
  - Lack of encryption
  - Persistent TCP sessions
  - Predictable sequence numbering

## The Question
- Can attackers spoof commands to these access systems without needing an authentication medium?

## Overview of Electronic Building Access Systems
- **Components:**
  - Authentication devices (e.g., card readers)
  - Locking devices (e.g., door locks)
  - Control system (door controller)
  - Central database
- **Network Architecture:**
  - Door controllers are connected via TCP/IP to a central database.
  - Client programs are used to make changes to the database, which are then propagated to the door controllers.
  - The status of locks and alarm points is monitored remotely.
  - Commands to lock and unlock doors can be sent across the network.

## Picking the Lock
### System Diagram
- **Client** → **Database** → **Door Controller** → **Doors**
- **Attacker** → **Client** → **Database** → **Door Controller** → **Doors**

## Why It Works: TCP Sequence Prediction
- **TCP Sequence Prediction:**
  - Typically used to hijack TCP sessions.
  - By guessing the next sequence number, an attacker can inject a packet into an existing session.
  - This vulnerability has been fixed in most modern operating systems and applications.
  - However, embedded systems, such as door controllers, are still notoriously vulnerable.

### Illustration
- **Normal TCP Session:**
  - Sender: SEQ 0
  - Receiver: SEQ 30
  - Sender: SEQ 60
  - Receiver: SEQ 90

- **Attacker Injects Packet:**
  - Sender: SEQ 0
  - Receiver: SEQ 30
  - Sender: SEQ 60
  - Attacker: SEQ 60
  - Receiver: WTF??

## Proof of Concept
- Demonstration of how an attacker can exploit TCP sequence prediction to send unauthorized commands to the door controller.

## Conclusion
- **Key Findings:**
  - Breaking the authentication medium is not necessary to bypass a networked electronic building access system.
  - Any networked device must protect itself against networking vulnerabilities.
  - These problems are not hard to fix.
- **Recommendations:**
  - **For You:**
    - Put door controllers on a separate LAN.
    - Monitor for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
  - **For Vendors:**
    - Make sequence numbers harder to guess.
    - Encrypt the traffic.

## The End

Thank you for your attention.
