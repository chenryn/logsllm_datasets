### Permission Comprehension and Decision Factors in Privacy Decisions

This section outlines two surveys designed to investigate users' understanding of permissions (Permission Comprehension) and the factors influencing their privacy decisions (Decision Factors). Both surveys include a background section with demographic questions to screen and filter responses.

#### Survey 1: Permission Comprehension

**Permission Group Comprehension:**
In the runtime permission model, permissions are managed in groups. This survey aims to evaluate whether users can understand the scope of each permission group, including the protected resources and permitted actions, based on system descriptions. Each question presents a permission request dialog (Figure 1) and asks respondents to select the actions the app can perform if the permission is granted. The choices include correct and incorrect actions, as well as "None of these" and "I don’t know" options. The survey covers all permission groups listed in Table 1, but only four randomly selected groups are presented to each respondent to avoid overwhelming them.

**Permission Model Changes (Android Only):**
The evolution of Android's permission model allows apps to gain permissions unintentionally. This section investigates whether Android users are aware of these changes and the associated risks. Respondents are shown a permission notice for low-version apps (Figure 3) and asked three questions:
1. Will the app access the listed resources immediately after clicking accept?
2. Can you change the permission settings later?
3. Will the app ask for permissions again after launching?

#### Survey 2: Decision Factors

This survey focuses on factors that influence users' decisions on permission requests. Six decision factors are studied: reviews, rating, brand reputation, background access, data transmission, and grant rate. The definitions of these factors are provided in §6.1. The study compares how positive and negative messages about each factor impact users' permission decisions and assesses the perceived helpfulness of these factors.

**Simulated Scenarios:**
Each respondent is given three simulated scenarios involving different permission groups (Contacts, Calendar, and Location). These groups are chosen because they are available on both Android and iOS. The scenarios are:
1. **Felp (Contacts):** An app to find good restaurants.
2. **RShare (Calendar):** An app to find rides and carpools.
3. **LCGE (Location):** An app to pay utility bills and view energy usage.

Respondents are shown app screenshots before and after permission requests (Figure 4) and must decide whether to allow or deny the requests twice: once without additional messages and once with messages related to one of the six decision factors.

**Messages for Decision Factors:**
Table 2 lists the messages displayed for each factor, framed positively and negatively. For example, ratings and reviews are presented with extreme values, and brand reputation is based on GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001 certifications.

**Permission Comprehension Correlation:**
To study the correlation between comprehension and permission decisions, the survey includes questions from Survey 1 for the permission groups used in the scenarios (Contacts, Calendar, and Location).

#### Background Section

Both surveys include a background section with OS version information and demographic questions. Respondents must provide their OS version, and those with Android versions below 6.0 are excluded. Demographic data collected includes gender, age, education level, experience in computer science, privacy knowledge, and occupation.

#### Recruitment

Surveys were conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) from April 2019 to May 2020. AMT workers must be at least 18 years old with a 98%+ approval rate. To avoid bias, security and privacy terms were not used in task descriptions. Respondents must have a smartphone. Valid responses were 359 for Survey 1 and 1200 for Survey 2, with average completion times of 6.78 and 7.81 minutes, respectively. Each respondent was compensated $1.

#### Demographics

Key demographics for the interview study (n=20), Survey 1 (n=359), and Survey 2 (n=1200) are shown in Figure 5. Most respondents reported no experience in computer science, IT, or related fields.

#### Ethical Considerations

The study was conducted under a university-company collaboration. PerChecker, the app used, explicitly requests user approval for data collection. Data is encrypted, and no personal identifiable information is saved. The university’s IRB concluded that the study did not require review.

#### Threats to Validity

Potential biases in user studies include self-reported data and unrepresentative samples. Multiple data sources, including real users' permission settings from PerChecker (n=4636) and user studies (n=1559), were used to cross-validate findings.

#### Permission Model Change

Android introduced runtime permission requests in Android 6.0. For compatibility, low-version apps (targeting versions before Android 6.0) still get all permissions granted at installation without user consent. Our analysis shows that 61.8% of PerChecker users have at least one such app installed, and 6.7% have five or more. Many of these apps are actively updated, suggesting developers may lack motivation to update or intentionally exploit the design flaws. Table 3 and Table 4 provide details on the prevalence and updates of low-version apps.
