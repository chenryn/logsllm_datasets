Stakeholder 
Enrollment 
Figure 2-9 
Stakeholder Enrollment is a concept that builds on Stakeholder identification,  
analysis, and management activities that are prescribed by the CA-PMF. Eforts  
in this knowledge area serve to connect the OCM Practitioner with Stakeholders  
at all levels to ensure they are informed and accepting of the change initiative.  
As shown in Figure 2-9, the goal of Stakeholder Enrollment is to obtain buy in  
for the change initiative from those who influence the change or those who are  
impacted by the change. The Stakeholder enrollment efort includes updating the  
Stakeholder Management Plan, identifying and engaging Stakeholder resources  
to act as liaisons and role models, and identifying and mitigating resistance. 
Figure 2-10 shows the inputs, roles, skills, activities, tools, and outputs of the 
Stakeholder Enrollment Knowledge Area during the Executing Process Phase.

2.5.1 Inputs 
In  order  to  complete  the  Executing  Process  Phase  Stakeholder  Enrollment  
activities,  the  OCM  Practitioner  will  need  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  
following inputs: 
Stakeholder  Register:  The  Stakeholder  Register,  developed  in  the  Initiating  
Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, identifies the organizations, groups,  
and individuals with a role in the project. 
Stakeholder Management Plan: The Stakeholder Management Plan, developed  
in  the  Planning  Process  Phase  as  prescribed  by  the  CA-PMF,  describes  the  
processes, procedures, tools, and techniques to efectively engage Stakeholders  
in project decisions based on Stakeholder needs, interests, and requirements.

2.5.3  Activities 
Stakeholder  Enrollment  is  critical  for  implementation  success,  and  the  goal 
of this knowledge area is to ensure that Stakeholders at every level, including 
employees,  are  ready,  willing,  and  able  to  make  the  changes  defined  by  the 
project. The Project Manager and project team began the process of identifying, 
assessing, and managing Stakeholders in the Initiating and Planning Process 
Phases; however, it is important for the OCM Practitioner to build on and broaden 
these eforts in the Executing Process Phase in order to engage Stakeholders 
and  manage  Stakeholder  resistance.  As  such,  the  OCM  Practitioner  should 
complete the following four activities and related tasks in this process phase: 
•  Update the Stakeholder Management Plan 
•  Identify and Engage Stakeholder Group Representatives 
•  Identify and Engage OCM Super Users 
•  Provide Guidance for Identifying and Mitigating Resistance 
Update the Stakeholder Management Plan 
The Stakeholder Management Plan, completed in the Planning Process Phase 
as  prescribed  by  the  CA-PMF,  describes  Stakeholder  identification,  analysis, 
and management strategies. This plan should be reviewed and updated at the 
onset of the Executing Process Phase, as well as on a regular basis throughout 
the implementation, to ensure that appropriate OCM considerations are made. 
In updating the Stakeholder Management Plan , the OCM Practitioner should 
review and as needed modify the following sections: 
•  Section 3.1, Stakeholder Identification: This section details the process  
for identifying all project Stakeholders. The Project Manager begins  
the identification process in the Initiating Process Phase in order to  
complete the Stakeholder Register. In the Executing Process Phase, the  
OCM Practitioner should review the Stakeholder identification process  
and consider revising the Stakeholder Register to identify smaller, more  
focused groups of Stakeholders who influence or are impacted by the  
project. The OCM Practitioner may consider a break down by organizational  
level, organizational unit, job role, or any other criteria that categorizes  
Stakeholders.

•  Section 3.2, Stakeholder Analysis: This section details the process for  
assessing a Stakeholder’s level of project influence and level of project  
impact in order to tailor communications and interactions to that specific  
Stakeholder. The OCM Practitioner should consider reviewing this process  
depending on the modifications to Section 3.1 Stakeholder Identification  
above. 
•  Section 3.3, Stakeholder Management Strategies: This section 
explains the development of Stakeholder management strategies for 
communicating and interacting with Stakeholders. The OCM Practitioner 
should review and if needed modify this section based on three factors: 
°  Updates made to Sections 3.1 and 3.2 above. The OCM Practitioner will 
need to update the Stakeholder Information Distribution Matrix to 
reflect newly identified Stakeholders, their interests, and their desired 
messages. Refer to the Communication Knowledge Area section of this 
chapter for more information on identifying communication needs and 
gathering feedback. 
°  Identification of Stakeholder Group Representatives. These resources, 
discussed in more detail in the following activities, may act as 
“communication channels” by communicating and interacting 
with the larger population of Stakeholders. Stakeholder Group 
Representatives serve as liaisons between the OCM Practitioner, project 
team, and their represented Stakeholder population. Stakeholder 
Group Representatives gather information and feedback from their 
representative Stakeholder group, communicate project information to 
the Stakeholder group, and identify signs of resistance to the change. 
°   Identification of Super Users. These resources, discussed in more detail 
in the following activities, act as role models for the change initiative, 
in addition to supporting use of the new system. They lead the change 
efort by modeling willing participation, active engagement, and positive 
attitudes toward the change.

Stakeholder Enrollment 
Identify and Engage Stakeholder  
Group Representative 
While  the  Stakeholder  Register  and  Stakeholder  Management  Plan  provide 
a  foundation  for  Stakeholder  Enrollment,  it  is  important  to  build  on  this 
foundation in order to gain the support of Stakeholders. Part of this enrollment 
process includes utilizing Stakeholder Group Representatives to act as liaisons 
between the OCM Practitioner, project team, and their represented Stakeholder 
population. These representatives help to engage Stakeholders by: 
•  Gathering information about the group’s priorities, needs, and 
requirements. Representatives of a Stakeholder group are positioned to 
have the most accurate information about the group as a whole. These 
resources can provide information from firsthand experience which will be 
beneficial in planning and tailoring OCM activities for the specific group. 
•  Communicating project information to their Stakeholder group. 
Stakeholder Group Representatives ofen play a key role in communicating  
project information to the rest of their group. Messages from a person within  
the Stakeholder group are generally well received because the representative  
understands the group’s needs and relates with how the initiative impacts the  
group, both of which lead to a sense of trust in the message. 
•  Identifying signs of resistance and resistance drivers within the group. 
A Stakeholder Group Representative is well positioned to monitor the 
group for signs of resistance and facilitate mitigating eforts. 
To identify Stakeholder Group Representatives, the OCM Practitioner begins by 
reviewing the updated Stakeholder Register to identify Stakeholder groups. Next, 
the OCM Practitioner collaborates with the Project Manager and project team to 
determine the number of resources needed, with larger, more diverse groups 
being  represented  with  more  representatives.  Finally,  the  OCM  Practitioner 
collaborates with mid-level management and supervisors to identify suitable 
resources  to  fill  this  role.  These  resources  should  be  comfortable  with  the 
change  and  should  possess  several  skills,  including  communication,  active 
listening, and collaboration. 
Once the Stakeholder Group Representatives are identified, the OCM Practitioner  
meets  with  them  to  define  their  role,  set  behavior  guidelines,  and  identify  
responsibilities.  The  OCM  Practitioner  should  use  his/her  knowledge  of  the  
organization, Stakeholder groups, and the change initiative, as well as input from

the Project Manager to define specific roles and responsibilities of the Stakeholder  
Group  Representatives.  The  OCM  Practitioner  should  document  Stakeholder  
Group Representative resource names and types of engagement within Section  
3: Register of the project’s Stakeholder Register. For more information on building  
group dynamics, review the Team Dynamics sections of the Initiating, Planning,  
and  Executing  Process  Phase  chapters.  While  the  Team  Dynamics  Knowledge  
Area focuses on the project team, many of the activities and tools are useful when  
working with teams of Stakeholder Group Representatives. 
Identify and Engage Super Users 
Another  helpful  role  for  Stakeholder  Enrollment  is  that  of  the  Super  Users. 
Though more generally used as first-level support for end users, Super Users 
can also serve as role models for the larger population of Stakeholders. This 
role provides a positive example for Stakeholders to follow and replicate. Super 
Users need to demonstrate certain behaviors in order to be efective as role 
models. The following list are potential criteria for selecting Super Users: 
•  Show enthusiastic support for the project 
•  Project poise and confidence 
•  Show willingness to help others 
•  Demonstrate the ability to grasp the context of their own roles on the  
total project 
•  Participate in the project throughout its lifecycle, including in design 
•  Participate in testing 
•  Articulate information efectively 
•  Build positive relationships 
To identify Super Users, the OCM Practitioner begins by reviewing the updated 
Stakeholder Register to identify Stakeholder groups that would benefit from 
Super Users. Next, the OCM Practitioner collaborates with the Project Manager 
and project team to determine the number of resources needed, with larger, 
more  diverse  groups  needing  a  larger  number  of  Super  Users.  Finally,  the 
OCM Practitioner collaborates with mid-level management and supervisors to 
identify suitable resources to fill this role. These resources should be identified 
based on the criteria listed above.

Stakeholder Enrollment 
Once the Super Users are identified, the OCM Practitioner meets with them to 
define their role, set behavior guidelines, and identify responsibilities. The OCM 
Practitioner  should  use  his/her  knowledge  of  the  organization,  Stakeholder 
groups, and the change initiative, as well as input from the Project Manager, to 
define specific roles and responsibilities of the Super Users. The OCM Practitioner 
should document Super User names and types of engagement within Section 3: 
Register of the project’s Stakeholder Register. For more information on building 
group dynamics, review the Team Dynamics sections of the Initiating, Planning, 
and Executing Process Phase chapters. While the Team Dynamics Knowledge 
Area focuses on the project team, many of the activities and tools are useful 
when working with teams of Super Users. 
Provide Guidance for Identifying and  
Mitigating Resistance 
While it is recognized that resistance is a normal reaction to change, the OCM 
Practitioner  should  be  aware  of  the  possibility  of  resistance  and  prepare 
managers and supervisors with mitigating strategies to deal with resistance. 
Stakeholder resistance can manifest in many ways. Employees may vocally take 
a stand against the change. They may continually question the efort and its 
benefits. They may refuse to take part in activities related to the change. They 
may  approach  management  and  executives  with  their  concerns.  No  matter 
what form resistance takes, the OCM Practitioner should meet with managers 
and supervisors to discuss the following topics: 
•  Signs of resistance. Resistance takes many forms, as identified above. 
Managers and supervisors should monitor for resistance using informal 
observations and conversations, as well as employee feedback. 
•  Possible reasons behind resistance. Employees resist change for many  
reasons. See the table on the following page for examples of resistance drivers. 
•  Mitigating strategies. Strategies for mitigating resistance are not 
one-size-fits-all. How a manager or supervisor mitigates resistance is 
dependent on the employee, the type of resistance shown, and the 
resistance drivers. For example, a supervisor may notice an employee 
refusing to participate in project activities and training eforts. The 
supervisor, afer meeting with the employee, understands that this 
resistance is due to conflicting priorities and a lack of time the employee

has to participate in change activities. As such, the supervisor should take 
action to emphasize the need for the change and to help the employee 
prioritize eforts. Other sample mitigating actions, based on an associated 
resistance driver, are listed in the table below.

The manager/supervisor may communicate 
to the OCM Practitioner the need for targeted 
communication messages that highlight project 
information such as the business need, solution, 
and timeline/milestones. 
The manager/supervisor may meet with the 
employee to listen to his/her concerns and 
emphasize the need for this particular change 
initiative. 
The supervisor/manager may communicate 
with the OCM Practitioner to identify targeted 
communication and training activities that will 
better inform and prepare the employee for 
implementation. 
Uncertainty about 
gaining needed 
knowledge, skills, 
and abilities 
The supervisor/manager, with the assistance of 
the OCM Practitioner and training lead, may meet
with the employee to discuss training options to 
gain the needed knowledge, skills, and abilities. 
Mistrust in 
leadership 
Conflicting priorities 
The supervisor/manager may ask the OCM 
Practitioner to facilitate interactions between 
employees and leaders to build a culture of trust. 
The supervisor/manager may meet with the 
employee to emphasize the need for the change 
and to help the employee prioritize eforts.

Stakeholder Enrollment 
The  OCM  Practitioner  should  take  the  time  to  prepare  and  coach  managers 
and supervisors on resistance management. In addition, the OCM Practitioner 
should  communicate  that,  while  many  instances  of  resistance  may  be 
mitigated successfully, some may not. The OCM Practitioner should work with 
managers and supervisors to identify actions to take when resistance cannot be 
successfully mitigated and include Human Resources as necessary. 
The OCM Practitioner should utilize the Stakeholder Enrollment Action Log to 
record all Stakeholder Enrollment actions, including meeting with managers 
and  supervisors.  This  working  document  serves  to  track  all  Stakeholder 
Enrollment activities and tasks throughout the PMLC.
