### Stakeholder Enrollment

#### 2.5.1 Overview
Stakeholder Enrollment is a critical component of the Organizational Change Management (OCM) process, building on the foundational activities of stakeholder identification, analysis, and management as prescribed by the California Project Management Framework (CA-PMF). The primary goal of this knowledge area is to ensure that stakeholders at all levels are informed and supportive of the change initiative. As illustrated in Figure 2-9, the objective is to gain buy-in from those who influence or are impacted by the change.

**Figure 2-9: Stakeholder Enrollment Goal**

The Stakeholder Enrollment effort involves:
- Updating the Stakeholder Management Plan.
- Identifying and engaging stakeholder resources to act as liaisons and role models.
- Identifying and mitigating resistance.

#### 2.5.3 Detailed Activities

**2.5.3.1 Update the Stakeholder Management Plan**
The Stakeholder Management Plan, developed in the Planning Process Phase, outlines the strategies for identifying, analyzing, and managing stakeholders. During the Executing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner should review and update this plan to reflect any changes and ensure it remains relevant. Key sections to review and modify include:

- **Section 3.1: Stakeholder Identification**  
  - Review and revise the Stakeholder Register to identify smaller, more focused groups.
  - Consider breaking down stakeholders by organizational level, unit, job role, or other criteria.

- **Section 3.2: Stakeholder Analysis**  
  - Assess the level of project influence and impact for each stakeholder.
  - Tailor communications and interactions based on the analysis.

- **Section 3.3: Stakeholder Management Strategies**  
  - Develop and update strategies for communicating and interacting with stakeholders.
  - Reflect changes in the Stakeholder Information Distribution Matrix.
  - Utilize Stakeholder Group Representatives and Super Users as communication channels.

**2.5.3.2 Identify and Engage Stakeholder Group Representatives**
Stakeholder Group Representatives act as liaisons between the OCM Practitioner, project team, and their respective stakeholder populations. Their responsibilities include:

- Gathering information about the group's priorities, needs, and requirements.
- Communicating project information to the stakeholder group.
- Identifying signs of resistance and resistance drivers within the group.

**Steps to Identify and Engage Stakeholder Group Representatives:**
1. Review the updated Stakeholder Register to identify stakeholder groups.
2. Collaborate with the Project Manager and project team to determine the number of representatives needed.
3. Work with mid-level management and supervisors to identify suitable representatives.
4. Meet with the representatives to define roles, set behavior guidelines, and identify responsibilities.
5. Document the names and types of engagement in the Stakeholder Register.

**2.5.3.3 Identify and Engage Super Users**
Super Users serve as role models for the change initiative and provide first-level support to end users. Criteria for selecting Super Users include:

- Enthusiastic support for the project.
- Poise and confidence.
- Willingness to help others.
- Ability to understand their role in the project.
- Participation in the project lifecycle, including design and testing.
- Effective communication and positive relationship-building skills.

**Steps to Identify and Engage Super Users:**
1. Review the updated Stakeholder Register to identify stakeholder groups that would benefit from Super Users.
2. Collaborate with the Project Manager and project team to determine the number of Super Users needed.
3. Work with mid-level management and supervisors to identify suitable Super Users.
4. Meet with the Super Users to define roles, set behavior guidelines, and identify responsibilities.
5. Document the names and types of engagement in the Stakeholder Register.

**2.5.3.4 Provide Guidance for Identifying and Mitigating Resistance**
Resistance to change is a common occurrence. The OCM Practitioner should prepare managers and supervisors to identify and mitigate resistance. Key steps include:

- Recognizing signs of resistance.
- Understanding possible reasons behind resistance.
- Implementing mitigating strategies tailored to the specific situation.

**Resistance Drivers and Possible Mitigating Actions:**

| **Resistance Driver** | **Possible Mitigating Actions** |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Lack of understanding of the change | Targeted communication messages highlighting project information. |
| Change initiative fatigue | Meeting with employees to listen to concerns and emphasize the need for the change. |
| Uncertainty about changing job roles and responsibilities | Targeted communication and training activities to better inform and prepare employees. |
| Uncertainty about gaining needed knowledge, skills, and abilities | Discussing training options with the employee. |
| Mistrust in leadership | Facilitating interactions between employees and leaders to build trust. |
| Conflicting priorities | Meeting with the employee to help prioritize efforts. |
