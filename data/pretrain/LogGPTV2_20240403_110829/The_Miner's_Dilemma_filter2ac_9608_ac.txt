it in a pool or working solo.

V. ONE ATTACKER
We begin our analysis with a simpliﬁed game of two
pools, 1 and 2, where pool 1 can inﬁltrate pool 2, but pool 2
cannot inﬁltrates pool 1. The m − m1 − m2 miners outside
both pools mine solo (or with closed pools that do not
attack and cannot be attacked). This scenario is illustrated in
Figure 3. The dashed red arrow indicates that x1,2 of pool 1’s
mining power inﬁltrates pool 2 with a block withholding
attack.
Since Pool 2 does not engage in block withholding, all
of its m2 loyal miners work on its behalf. Pool 1, on the
other hand does not employ x1,2 of its loyal miners, and its
direct mining power is only m1 − x1,2. The Bitcoin system
normalizes these rates by the total number of miners that
publish full proofs, namely all miners but x1,2. The pools’
direct revenues are therefore
R1 =
R2 =
m1 − x1,2
m − x1,2
m − x1,2
m2
.
(5)
Pool 2 divides its revenue among its loyal miners and the
miners that inﬁltrated it. Its revenue density is therefore
r2 =
R2
m2 + x1,2
.
(6)
Pool 1 divides its revenue among its registered miners.
The revenue includes both its direct mining revenue and
the revenue its inﬁltrators obtained from pool 2, which is
r2 · x1,2. The revenue per loyal Pool 1 miner is therefore
R1 + x1,2 · r2
m1
r1 =
.
(7)
We obtain the expression for r1 in Equation 7 by substi-
tuting r2 from Equation 6 and R1 and R2 from equation 5:
m1(m2 + x1,2) − x2
m1(m − x1,2)(m2 + x1,2)
1,2
r1 =
Pool 1 controls its inﬁltration rate of pool 2, namely x1,2,
and will choose the value that maximizes the revenue density
(per-miner revenue) r1 on the ﬁrst round of the pool game.
The value of r1 is maximized at a single point in the
feasible range 0 ≤ x1,2 ≤ m1. Since pool 2 cannot
not react to pool 1’s attack, this point is the stable state
of the system, and we denote the value of x1,2 there by
¯x1,2
r1 , and the values of the corresponding
revenues of the pools with ¯r1 and ¯r2.
Δ
= arg maxx1,2
Substituting the stable value x1,2 we obtain the revenues
of the two pools; all are given in Figure 4, normalizing
m = 1 to simplify the expressions.
B. Numerical Analysis
We analyze this game numerically by ﬁnding the x1,2
that maximizes r1 and substituting this value for r1 and r2.
We vary the sizes of the pools through the entire feasible
range and depict the optimal x1,2 and the corresponding
revenues in Figure 5. Each point in each graph represents
the equilibrium point of a game with the corresponding m1
and m2 sizes, where we normalize m = 1. The top right
half of the range in all graphs is not feasible, as the sum of
m1 and m2 is larger than 1. We use this range as a reference
color, and we use a dashed line to show the bound between
this value within the feasible range.
Figure 5a shows the optimal inﬁltration rate. In the entire
feasible range we see that pool 1 chooses a strictly positive
value for x1,2. Indeed, the revenue of pool 1 is depicted in
Figure 5b and in the entire feasible region it is strictly larger
than 1, which the pool would have gotten without attacking
(x1,2 = 0). Figure 5c depicts the revenue of Pool 2, which
is strictly smaller than 1 in the entire range.
Third parties: Note that the total system mining power
is reduced when pool 1 chooses to inﬁltrate pool 2. There-
fore, the revenue of third parties, miners not in either pool,
increases from 1/m to 1/(m − x1,2). Pool 2 therefore pays
for the increased revenue of its attacker and everyone else
in the system.
C. Implications to the general case
Consider the case of p pools. For any choice of the pools
sizes m1, . . . , mp, at least one pool will choose to perform
block withholding:
Lemma 2. In a system with p pools, the point ∀j, k : xk
is not an equilibrium.
j = 0
Proof: Assume towards negation this is not the case,
and ∀j, k : xk
j = 0 is an equilibrium point. Now consider
a setting with only pools 1 and 2, and treat the other pools
as independent miners. This is the setting analyzed above
and we have seen there that pool 1 can increase its revenue
by performing a block withholding attack on pool 2. Denote
pool 1’s inﬁltration rate by ˜x1,2 > 0. Now, take this values

back to the setting at hand with p pools. The revenue of
pool 1 is better when
x1,2 = ˜x1,2,∀(j, k) (cid:6)= (1, 2) : xj,k = 0 .
Therefore, pool 1 can improve its revenue by attacking
pool 2, and no-one-attacks is not an equilibrium point.
D. Test-case
As a test case, we take the pool distribution in January 16,
2015 [24], shown in Figure 6. We analyze the cases where
each of the pools attacks all other open pools, all of which
behave honestly. Note that attacking all pools with force
proportional to their size yields the same results as attacking
a single pool of their aggregate size. Plugging in the numbers
into the analysis above shows that a larger pool needs to use
a smaller ratio of its mining power for inﬁltration and can
increase its revenue density more than a small pool. The
largest pool, DiscusFish, achieves its optimum attack rate
at 25% of the pool’s mining power, increasing its revenue
by almost 3%. This amounts to a daily revenue increase
of B26 Bitcoin, or almost 5500 USD at the exchange rate
on that date. This represents a considerable increase of the
pools net revenue. However, for the smallest pool, Eligius,
the attack is much less proﬁtable. To reach the optimum it
needs almost a third of its power for attacking but increases
its revenue density by merely 0.6%, amounting to B0.86 a
day or 18 USD.

VI. TWO POOLS
We proceed to analyze the case where two pools may
attack each other and the other miners mine solo. Again
we have pool 1 of size m1 and pool 2 of size m2; pool 1
controls its inﬁltration rate x1,2 of pool 2, but now pool 2
also controls its inﬁltration rate x2,1 of pool 1. This scenario
is illustrated in Figure 8
The total mining power in the system is m − x1,2 − x2,1.
The direct revenues R1 and R2 of the pools from mining
are their effective mining rates, without inﬁltrating mining

The total revenue of each pool is its direct mining revenue,
above, and the inﬁltration revenue from the previous round,
which is the attacked pool’s total revenue multiplied by its
inﬁltration rate. The pool’s total revenue is divided among
its loyal miners and miners that inﬁltrated it. At stable state
this is
r1 =
r2 =
R1 + x1,2r2
m1 + x2,1
R2 + x2,1r1

Solving for r1 and r2 we obtain the following closed

of x1,2 and x2,1.

Each pool controls only its own inﬁltration rate. In each
round of the pool game, each pool will optimize its inﬁltra-
tion rate of the other. If pool 1 acts at step t, it optimizes
its revenue with
x1,2(t) ← arg max
x(cid:2)
r1(x(cid:4), x2,1(t − 1)) ,
and if pool 2 acts at step t, it optimizes its revenue with
x2,1(t) ← arg max
x(cid:2)
r2(x(cid:4), x1,2(t − 1)) .
An equilibrium exists where neither pool 1 nor pool 2 can
improve its revenue by changing its inﬁltration rate. That is,

and m1 + m2 ≤ m. The revenue function for ri is concave
in xi for all feasible values of the variables (∂2ri/∂x2
i < 0).
Therefore the solutions for equations 12 and 13 are unique
and are either at the borders of the feasible region or where
∂ri/∂xi,j = 0.
From Section V we know that no-attack is not an equi-
librium point, since each pool can increase its revenue by
