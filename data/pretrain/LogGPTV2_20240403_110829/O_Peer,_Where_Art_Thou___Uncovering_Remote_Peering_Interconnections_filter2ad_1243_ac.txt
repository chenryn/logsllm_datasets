obtain virtual ports through port resellers from peers that obtain
physical ports directly from the IXP.
3.3 Detecting IXP Crossings in Traceroutes
We process traceroute measurements (Section 3.1) and IXP informa-
tion (Section 3.2) with traIXroute [21, 65] to identify paths that
cross IXPs. We configure traIXroute to identify IXP crossings in
a path, when (i) there exists a sub-path of three IPs (i.e., IP triplet)
that contains an IXP IP in the middle of the triplet and this IXP IP
belongs to the same AS as the 3rd IP, (ii) the AS of the 1st IP in the
triplet is different, and (iii) these two ASes are members of the IXP
(whose prefix the IXP IP of the triplet belongs to).
3.4 Colocation Facilities
To infer the remoteness or locality of peers, we also use the location
of the facilities where IXPs and their members are present. We first
collect the facility list from PDB and Inflect [12], a database for
Internet infrastructure services (whose data comes either directly
from service providers or trusted third-party sources). For each facil-
ity we keep the geographical coordinates provided by PDB, which
are independently verified through Inflect to filter-out spurious
information [64]. Our dataset includes 656 IXPs which are associ-
ated with 1,078 facilities. The Inflect dataset allows us to correct
the geographical information for 308 of these facilities. Moreover,
we extract information related to which facility each AS (i.e., IXP
member) is present. As shown in Fig. 1a, around 60% of IXPs and
ASes are present in a single facility, with only 5% in more than
10 facilities. To alleviate possible incompleteness in PDB/Inflect
data, we extend the colocation dataset by manually extracting the
facility list from the websites of the 50 IXPs with most AS members.
IXP websites provide additional facility data for 48% of the IXPs,
allowing us to compile an as complete as possible dataset for the
most prominent IXPs.
PDB vs. Websites. We have encountered some discrepancies be-
tween PDB and IXP/facility websites. For example, the NL-IX web-
site provides additional information on 17 (∼15%) of its data centers
not present in PDB (incompleteness). On the other hand, for the
4
between 16 of NET-IX’s international sites. NET-IX measures the de-
lay between its different facilities based on the Y.1731 Performance
Monitoring standard [22], by sending precisely timestamped test
packets across its MetroNID network demarcation points. The re-
sults are shown in Fig. 2a. For 87% of the facility pairs the median
RTT is above 10ms. Note that we also observe facilities in different
countries with less than 10ms delay between them; for instance,
Frankfurt (FRA) and Prague (PRA) have a 7ms delay. Therefore, a
remoteness RTT-threshold is not meaningful for wide-area
IXPs.
Next, we quantify the popularity of the model of the wide-area
IXPs. We use our colocation dataset compiled in Section 3.4, and
we classify an IXP as wide-area if its switching fabric is deployed
among multiple facilities, and at least two of them are in different
metropolitan areas. Since there can be different naming conven-
tions used for the same city/metro area, we calculate the geodesic
distance between each pair of IXP facilities, by applying Karney’s
method [53] on their geographical coordinates. We consider facili-
ties more than 50km apart as located in different metropolitan areas.
For April 2018, we found that 64 of the 446 (14.4%) IXPs in PDB
with at least two IXP members are wide-area, including 10 of the
50 (20%) largest IXPs in terms of the size of their IXP member list
(Fig. 2b). Therefore, wide-area IXPs are fairly common and
not just some exceptional cases. Note that the infrastructure of
some IXPs can be thousands of kms apart. For instance, NL-IX has
facilities in London and Bucharest that are over 1,300km away from
each other.
The results of this section highlight that although RTT measure-
ments have the potential to provide useful insights w.r.t. the peering
approach employed by an IXP member, alone they are not adequate
to accurately infer remote peers. A 10ms-threshold is very conser-
vative in the case of IXPs concentrated in a single metropolitan
area, while it yields a large number of false positives in the case of
wide-area IXPs.
5 INFERENCE METHODOLOGY
To address the limitations of remote peering inference based exclu-
sively on latency measurements, we introduce a “first-principles”
[56] approach. We rely on domain-specific knowledge to identify
technological (beyond latency) and economic aspects of peering
connectivity (Section 5.1), and build upon these aspects to design a
methodology for inferring remote and local peers (Section 5.2). We
validate the proposed methodology in Section 5.3.
5.1 Design Aspects
5.1.1 Port Capacity. IXPs offer to ASes connectivity to switch
ports, whose capacity is typically between 1GE and 100GE [2]. To
make remote peering an attractive service, resellers split their phys-
ical ports to multiple virtual ports (e.g., via sub-interfaces/VLANs)
of lower capacity (rate-limiting), and offer them to remote peers at
lower prices. Fractional port capacities can be purchased only through
resellers today6. Thus, this information can indicate a network that
peers remotely, via a reseller, at an IXP. Figure 4 shows the port
capacity for remote and local peers in our control validation dataset.
6In rare cases, some old IXP members are connected to physical ports of capacity less
than the minimum offered today. This can be also due to stale entries in PDB.

4 RTT-BASED INFERENCE CHALLENGES
Here, we use the control subset of our validation dataset to investi-
gate the challenges and limitations of inferring RP based exclusively
on latency measurements (Section 4.1), placing emphasis on the
fairly common case of wide-area IXPs (Section 4.2).
4.1 RTT is not enough
For each IXP in our control dataset, there is no publicly available VP
to execute RTT measurements, but we obtained one-time access to
results from pings executed within the IXP infrastructure targeting
the peering interfaces of all the remote and local members of the
IXP. We apply the TTL match and TTL switch filters proposed in [36]
to discard replies with TTL values less than the expected maximum
(64 and 255 hops) that may indicate ping replies outside of the IXP
subnet. We repeat the measurements every 20 minutes for two
days, and we calculate the minimum RTT per IXP interface. As
shown in Fig. 1b, RTT values above 2ms are a very strong indication
of remote peers, with 99% of the local peers having RTT values
less than 1ms. This result is consistent with previous works that
exhibited that a delay of 1ms corresponds roughly to a distance of
100 km [54, 75], approximating the coverage (i.e., disk diameter) of
a single metropolitan area. However, low RTT does not necessarily
mean that a peer is local. Surprisingly, 18% of the remote peers
in our control dataset are within 1ms from the IXP, while 40%
are within 10ms, which is the “remoteness threshold” used in [36].
4.2 Wide-area IXP challenges
Conservative latency thresholds do not ensure the elimination of
peers which are falsely identified as remote for wide-area IXPs. In
fact, IXP members which are present in any of the facilities of such
IXPs are local to the IXP but can be remote to the measurement VP,
even if the VP is also hosted in one of the IXP’s facilities. An indica-
tive example is NET-IX, which has distributed its switching fabric in
facilities across 18 different countries [24]. To understand the RTT
characteristics among the different facilities of such a geographi-
cally distributed IXP, we obtained pairwise delay measurements

Figure 4: Capacity of IXP ports for remote and local peers in our
control validation dataset. Fast Ethernet (FE) carries traffic at the
rate of 100 Mbit/s and Gigabit Ethernet (GE) at 1 Gbit/s.
No local peer has port capacities below 1GE (which is the mini-
mum capacity for physical ports offered by the corresponding IXPs),
while 27% of remote peers access the IXP through ports of 1FE –
5FE capacity; on the other hand, ports of 100+GE are allocated only
to local peers.
5.1.2 Presence at Colocation Facilities. To establish a direct con-
nection to an IXP, an AS needs to deploy routing equipment in at
least one colocation facility where the IXP has deployed switching
equipment. Therefore, it is not possible for an AS to be a local peer of
an IXP if they are not colocated in a facility. As Fig. 5 shows, all local
peers of an IXP in our control validation dataset are present in at
least one IXP facility, while 95% of the remote peers do not have any
common facility with the IXP. Hence, assuming perfect knowledge
of the facilities where IXP members are present, identifying RP
would be a straightforward lookup process. However, the available
colocation data for IXP members are incomplete and noisy. For
example, in Fig. 5, there are no available data for 18% of the remote
peers, while 5% of them appear to have presence in one IXP facility.
To further investigate the latter 5% of RP cases, we contacted the
IXP operators. Their feedback suggested that such cases are either
an artifact of remote peers (not colocated with the IXP) adding the
facility of their port reseller in their PDB record, or a consequence
of the fact that peers (colocated with the IXP) prefer to connect
through a port reseller in order to buy virtual ports of lower capacity
at a discount price (see Section 5.1.1).
Figure 5: Number of IXP facilities where local and remote peers in
our control validation dataset are present.
5.1.3 Multi-IXP Routers. An AS may connect to multiple IXPs
through the same border router to reduce operational costs; we
call such routers multi-IXP routers. The IP interfaces of a multi-IXP
router might appear in different traceroute paths to be intercon-
nected with different IXPs. We distinguish three cases where this
is possible:
(1) When multiple IXPs are present in the same facility, a colocated
AS may connect directly to all of them using a single router
(Figure 3a).
(2) Remote peers may connect through the same provider (port re-
seller) to multiple remote IXPs where this provider has presence
(Figure 3b).
(3) An AS may connect with the same router to both local and
remote IXPs, if it is e.g., colocated with one IXP and uses a
reseller for another (Figure 3c).
5.1.4 Private Connectivity. Two networks colocated at the same
IXP-hosting facility can interconnect with each other (private peer-
ing) without using the IXP infrastructure, e.g., by directly connect-
ing their routers. This might be a more economical solution in case
they exchange large volumes of traffic [66]. Therefore, when an
IXP member appears to be privately connected with several ASes
which are colocated at the facility of the same IXP, this is a strong
indication that this member is local to the IXP.
5.2 Algorithm
We next describe our methodology for inferring remote peering,
by combining RTT measurements with the four peering aspects

discussed in Section 5.1. While the steps of the methodology can
be validated independently (see Section 5.3), the order in which
they are applied matters and was selected as follows. Step 1 (Port
Capacities) is first since it reliably infers RP, albeit with small cov-
erage. Step 2 (RTT measurement) generates data used for step 3.
Step 3 (RTT+colocation) is required as input by Step 4 (multi-IXP
routers) and 5 (private connectivity). Step 4 comes before step 5 due
to its higher accuracy; step 5 is the last resort for missing inferences.
Note also that while an individual step may miss some cases for
different reasons (e.g., incomplete colocation data or RTT outliers
in Step 2), these cases can be captured by a following step.
Step 1: Finding reseller customers via port capacities. IXP mem-
bers that reach the IXP through a reseller are identified as remote
peers (see Definition 1). As discussed in Section 5.1.1, members can
be connected to IXP ports of capacity lower than the minimum
physical port capacity Cmin offered by the IXP, only if they reach
the IXP through a reseller6. Hence, as a first step, for each IXP
member ASx we compare the port capacity Cx , reported either in
the IXP website or the Inflect and PDB databases, to the Cmin value
reported in the pricing section of the IXP’s website. If Cx < Cmin,
we infer that ASx is a remote peer using a virtual port obtained
through a reseller.
Step 2: Ping RTT Measurements. From every VP in an IXP (see
Section 3.1), we execute ping measurements to every IXP IP inter-
face of the IXP’s members (see Section 3.2). To reduce the sensitivity
of the results to network conditions, we repeat the measurements
every two hours for two days, which results in 24 measurements in
total for each {VP, IP interface} pair. Similarly to Section 4, we apply
the TTL match and TTL switch filters to discard measurements with-
out consistent TTL values. Finally, for each responsive IP interface
we store the minimum RTT value, RTTmin, to counter transient
latency inflation artifacts [51].
Step 3: Colocation-informed RTT interpretation. To infer local and
remote peers, we analyze the collected RTTmin values. Besides the
colocation information of the IXPs and its members (see Section 3.4),
the exact locations of the VPs are also known in all ping measure-
ments. From the value of the RTTmin we calculate a geographical
area (circle or ring) around the VP location where the IP interface

cation data to infer local peers at geographically distributed IXPs.
(and thus the router) of the IXP member can be located. The pres-
ence (or not) of a facility of the IXP in this area, denotes a local (or
remote) peering, respectively.
More precisely, we first calculate the distance between the in-
volved VPs and each of the IXP’s facilities, as described in Section 4.
Then, from the observed RTTmin, we calculate the potential dis-
tance between the VP and the ping target (IP interface at a member’s
router). Katz-Bassett et. al [54] found that the end-to-end probe

packet speed is at most vmax = 4
As shown in Fig. 6 (green/dashed curve), our dataset of facility-to-
facility delays based on Y.1731 measurements obtained from NL-IX
and NET-IX confirms this. Through data fitting, we also find an
approximate lower bound (red/continuous curve in Fig. 6) for the
speed vmin(d) = 107 · (ln(d) − 3), where d is the distance. Based on
these bounds7, we estimate that the ping target is within a distance
range Df easible = [dmin, dmax] (green area in Fig. 7) from the VP,
where dmin = vmin × RTTmin and dmax = vmax × RTTmin. We
call the facility that is located in Df easible, a feasible facility.
Based on the estimated area defined by Df easible (see e.g., Fig. 7),
and the distances between the IXP facilities and the VP, we infer
that the IXP member that owns the queried IP interface (ping target)
is local or remote to the IXP, as follows:
(1) Remote peer: if (i) the IXP has no available feasible facility,
or (ii) the IXP has at least one feasible facility, but the peer is
present in another feasible facility where the IXP is not present.
(2) Local peer: if the IXP has at least one feasible facility, and the
IXP member is also colocated in one of the feasible IXP facilities.
(3) No inference: if the IXP has at least one feasible facility, but
the IXP member is not present at any feasible facility.
In the latter case, it is likely that our colocation dataset is incomplete
