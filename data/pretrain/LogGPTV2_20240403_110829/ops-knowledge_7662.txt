Assistant: The following are suggestions for troubleshooting network latency and packet loss: 1. Check your network connection: Make sure your network connection is good and not disconnected or weak. 2. Restart routers and devices: Sometimes restarting routers and devices can help resolve network latency and packet loss issues. 3. Close other programs: Close other programs that occupy more network resources to improve network operation efficiency. 4. Use a wired connection: A wired connection is more stable than a wireless connection and can reduce packet loss. 5. Optimize network settings: Adjust network parameters, such as channels, frequency bands, etc., to improve network performance. 6. Use QoS technology: QoS technology (Quality of Service) can guarantee the transmission quality of key application data packets and reduce packet loss. 7. Change ISP: If network problems persist, you may need to consider changing your Internet Service Provider (ISP). In short, network delay and packet loss problems usually require a combination of various improvement measures to be resolved.
