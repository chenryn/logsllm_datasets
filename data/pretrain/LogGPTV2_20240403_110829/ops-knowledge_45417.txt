User: My app maintains the state of a bunch of objects with variables.
I'm using Twisted to accept socket requests and return the properties of an object.
I want to make sure the app can scale for a lot of requests so I'm wondering if I should deliver the object properties directly from the objects, or if I should store those properties in memcached or something similar, and have the requests read from that store.
I just wasn't sure if lots of requests reading the same object values would affect the performance of the part of the app that is managing those objects.
Am I over thinking it?
Assistant: I don't think you have any performance penalty because of having many reading operations from the same object (only one thread is executed at a time after all).
