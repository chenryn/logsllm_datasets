Big Challenges
Semantics are critical to support the next generation of the
Web.
The important contribution of the “Semantic Web”, vis-à-vis
the current Web, is the ability to represent and process
descriptions of every resource on the Web.
A resource description, informally called its “semantics”,
includes that information about the resource that can be used
by machines - not just for display purposes, but for using it in
various applications.

Components of a Solution
This tutorial focuses on two issues:
Semantic Web Services are Web Services with a formal
description (semantics) that can enable a better discovery,
selection, composition, monitoring, and interoperability.
Processes are next steps to carrying out core business activities,
such as e-commerce and e-services, and are created from the
composition of Web Services or other components.
7
Our Focus
In a nutshell, this tutorial is about associating semantics to
Web Services, and exploiting it in process composition
Frameworks, Standards
Functional perspective takes form of process composition
involving Web Service Discovery, addressing semantic
heterogeneity handling.
Operational perspective takes form of the research on QoS
specification for Web Services and Processes.

Definition
“Web services are a new breed of Web application.
They are self-contained, self-describing, modular
applications that can be published, located, and invoked
across the Web. Web services perform functions, which
can be anything from simple requests to complicated
business processes. …
Once a Web service is deployed, other applications
(and other Web services) can discover and invoke the
deployed service.”
IBM web service tutorial

What are Web-Services ?
Web Services connect computers and devices with
each other using the Internet to exchange data and
combine data in new ways.
The key to Web Services is on-the-fly software creation
through the use of loosely coupled, reusable software
components.
Software can be delivered and paid for as streams of
services as opposed to packaged products.
Business services can be completely decentralized and
distributed over the Internet.
The dynamic enterprise and dynamic value chains
become achievable and may be even mandatory.

Attributes of Web-Services
Web-based Protocols : Web-services based on HTTP are
designed to work over the public internet. The use of
HTTP for transport means these protocols can traverse
firewalls, and can work in a heterogeneous environment.
Interoperability : SOAP defines a common standard that
allows differing systems to interoperate. E.g., the tooling
allows Visual Basic clients to access Java server
components and vice versa.
XML-based : The Extensible Markup Language is a
standard framework for creating machine-readable
documents.

State of the Art
UDDI provides a mechanism for clients to find web
services. A UDDI registry is similar to a CORBA
trader, or it can be thought of as a DNS for business
applications.
WSDL defines services as collections of network
endpoints or ports. A port is defined by associating a
network address with a binding; a collection of ports
define a service.
SOAP is a message layout specification that defines a
uniform way of passing XML-encoded data. It also
defines a way to bind to HTTP as the underlying
communication protocol. SOAP is basically a
technology to allow for “RPC over the web”.

From S. Chandrasekaran’s Talk
Web Service Description
Why describe Web services?
A service requestor needs to analyze a service for his
requirements
A Web service needs to provide the following
information
the operations it supports
the transport and messaging protocols on which it supports those
operations
the network endpoint of the Web service
Languages such as WSDL, DAML-S, RDF can be used
for describing Web services
WSDL – describes the syntactic information of a service
DAML-S and RDF – describe the syntactic as well as the semantic
information

Web Service Message Protocol - SOAP
SOAP is an XML Messaging Protocol
that allows software running on disparate operating systems,
running in different environments to
make Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).

UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and
Integration)
UDDI serves as a “Business and services” registry and are essential
for dynamic usage of Web services
UDDI APIs
Publication API - Authenticated set of operations that allow
organizations to publish businesses, services, service type
specifications
Inquiry API - Non authenticated public set of operations that
allows users to extract information out of the UDDI registry.
From S. Chandrasekaran’s Talk 21
UDDI
UDDI classifies businesses and services according to standard
taxonomies
Why Classification ?
Searches based on keywords alone, could return a large set of
hits for a particular search
Classification of services and businesses allows to perform better
searches
Registry Data
White Pages
Yellow Pages
Green Pages
ServiceType Registrations
22
From S. Chandrasekaran’s Talk
UDDI
WWhhiittee PPaaggeess
contains business name, text description, contact info and other
related info.
 Yellow Pages
contains classification information about the business entity and
types of the services the entity offers.
e.g. a business entity could have itself classified as a sports equipment
manufacturer and also as a skateboard manufacturer.
GGrreeeenn PPaaggeess
contains information about how to invoke the offered services.
If a business entity were to offer its catalog online, its Green
pages entry would have a reference to its catalog URL
From S. Chandrasekaran’s Talk 23
UDDI
Service Types
Reusable, abstract definitions of services ( ~ abstract part of WSDL)
that are defined by industry groups and standard bodies.
These reusable abstractions are referred to as “Technology Models”
The UDDI data structure corresponding to this is called “TModels”
TModels
Any abstract concept can be registered within UDDI as a TModel.
e.g. If you define a new WSDL port type, you can define a TModel
that represents the port type within the UDDI
From S. Chandrasekaran’s Talk 24

Services Aspect of
Web-Services
Modular : Service Components are useful in themselves,
reusable, and it is possible to compose them into larger
components.
Available : Services are available to systems that wish to
use them. Services must be exposed outside of the
particular paradigm or system they are available in.
Described : Services have a machine-readable description
that can be used to identify the interface of the service, and
its location and access information.
Implementation-independent : The service interface must be
available in a way that is independent of the ultimate
implementation.
Published : Service descriptions are made available in a
repository where users can find the service and use the
description to access the service.

Missing Concepts in Web services
Data definition
XML Schema is definition language for input and output
message
No domain specific data definitions
Invocation behavior
No operation sequence definition
All operations are equal w.r.t. behavior. Any restriction to be
known (by magic) by invoker
Mediation
No mediation of data
No mediation of behavior

Missing elements in Web services (continued)
Composition
No concepts for composition
Trading Partner Management
Web services recognize URIs as endpoints and do not
incorporate trading partner management
Service level guarantees
Web services do not contain any service level agreements
