ABSTRACT
In recent years, DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) has gained signicant
traction as a privacy-preserving alternative to unencrypted DNS.
While several studies have measured DoH performance relative to
traditional DNS and other encrypted DNS schemes, they are often
incomplete, either conducting measurements from single countries
or are unable to compare encrypted DNS to default client behavior.
To expand on existing research, we use the BrightData proxy net-
work to gather a dataset consisting of 22,052 unique clients across
224 countries and territories. Our data shows that the performance
impact of a switch to DoH is mixed, with a median slowdown of
65ms per query across a 10-query connection, but with 28% of
clients receiving a speedup over that same interval. We compare
four public DoH providers, noting that Cloudare excels in both
DoH resolution time (265ms) and global points-of-presence (146).
Furthermore, we analyze geographic dierences between DoH and
Do53 resolution times, and provide analysis on possible causes,
nding that clients from countries with low Internet infrastructure
investment are almost twice as likely to experience a slowdown
when switching to DoH as those with high Internet infrastructure
investment. We conclude with possible improvements to the DoH
ecosystem. We hope that our ndings can help to inform continuing
DoH deployments.

1 INTRODUCTION
Over the past few years, several industry actors have advocated
for a transition to DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) as a privacy-preserving
alternative to traditional, unencrypted, UDP-based DNS (Do53).
Mozilla Firefox already defaults to DoH in Firefox for clients in
the United States [36], Google has announced a gradual rollout of
DoH by default in Google Chrome [6], Microsoft plans to build
DoH into both the Edge browser and Windows operating system
itself [34], and Apple has built encrypted DNS into their platforms
for developers to integrate [1].
In response to these commitments to deploy DoH, prior work
has investigated encrypted DNS performance in many ways. Houn-
sel et al. studied how encrypted DNS aects web browsing using
ve EC2 nodes [21] and the direct performance impact faced by US
clients [22]. Lu et al. studied the reachability and performance of
DoH servers to residential nodes around the world [29], though
they approximated Do53 behavior using TCP and only with se-
lected resolvers (instead of clients’ default resolvers). Inspired by
these eorts, our paper focuses on capturing direct comparisons
between DoH performance and the default client DNS behavior to
assess the performance impact of the transition to DoH. In addition,
we seek to understand whether (and how) the transition to DoH
would unequally aect clients in dierent countries and territories.
Understanding these dierences is key to understanding how to
make equitable rollout decisions for DoH worldwide.
In this paper, we leverage BrightData (formerly Luminati) [4],
a residential HTTPS proxy network, to conduct DoH and Do53
performance measurements from 22,052 clients located in 224 coun-
tries and territories. We develop careful heuristics for measuring
DoH and Do53 performance through the BrightData network by
instructing BrightData clients to resolve fresh domain names un-
der our control (i.e., cache miss performance). This allows us to
explore the performance lower-bound for both Do53 and DoH. We
demonstrate through ground truth validation experiments that our
heuristics almost exactly approximate DoH and Do53 performance
for BrightData clients, with errors of up to 10ms for DoH and 2ms
for Do53. Our results serve as the closest exact measurements of
DoH and Do53 performance for residential clients around the world.
We compare DoH measurements drawn from four public reso-
lution services (Cloudare, Google, NextDNS, Quad9) and default
resolution behavior on end-clients. We nd that clients globally

take a median 415ms to resolve an initial DoH query, compared to a
median 234ms for a single Do53 query. 19.1% of DoH clients enjoy
a speedup in performance even on the rst request (despite the
TLS handshake), aligned with prior studies suggesting that DoH
may outperform Do53 in select cases [20]. For example, clients in
Indonesia see their median resolution time drop by 179ms upon
switching from Do53 to DoH. Most clients and countries, however,
do not enjoy such a speedup. Even after accounting for time spent
on the initial TLS handshake, clients in Sudan, for example, expe-
rience a 264ms median increase in resolution time across the four
DoH providers we study. We also examine dierences between
DoH providers, and nding that Cloudare has 36% more points-
of-presence (PoP) and resolves queries 21% faster than the next
closest DoH resolution service. In addition, we approximate geo-
graphic distances between clients and their resolvers, nding that
DoH providers often fail to select the closest PoP for each client,
sometimes by huge margins. Quad9, for example, only assigns 21%
of clients to the closest available PoP, according to our dataset.
To better explain dierences in DoH performance around the
world, we model DoH and Do53 performance as the outcome of
several explanatory variables focused on Internet infrastructure
investment, economic development, and DoH infrastructure prop-
erties (e.g., resolver choice, PoP placement). We nd countries with
low economic development and low Internet infrastructure invest-
ment are more likely to experience signicant DoH slowdowns
compared to Do53. For example, clients from countries with nation-
wide bandwidth <25Mbps experience a median slowdown of 350ms
when transitioning to DoH from Do53, compared to just 112ms
for clients in countries with faster Internet speeds. We observe
these trends are still signicant even when considering multiple
requests using a single TLS session for DoH queries, highlighting
that while reused connections may dampen the performance cost
slightly, they still disproportionately impact countries with fewer
economic capacity.
We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our mea-
surements on DoH rollout globally and how to support and enable
future research in this space. To this end, we provide our dataset1
in the hopes that it may aid in further research. We hope our results
will add context to the discussion surrounding DoH deployment
and can inform relevant parties on DoH deployment strategies.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
(1) We conduct measurements of DoH and Do53 performance
globally at 22,052 residential clients from 224 countries, and
are able to directly evaluate the performance cost of switch-
ing to DoH from default client DNS behavior. Our dataset
will be released at publication time.
(2) We show that DoH performance varies for clients around
the world, and that while most clients would experience only
a moderate slowdown, 10% of the clients in our dataset see
their resolution times triple as a result of switching from their
default resolver to DoH. We nd that 8.8% of the countries
benet from a switch to DoH from Do53.

(3) We nd that a signicant number of clients are not being
routed to the public resolver PoP nearest to them. For exam-
ple, 26% of Cloudare clients could be switched to a PoP at
least 1,000 miles closer.
(4) We model DoH and Do53 performance as an outcome of
several explanatory variables, and nd that countries with
lower Internet infrastructure investment will experience dis-
proportionate slowdowns in a unilateral switch to DoH from
Do53.
2 BACKGROUND AND GOALS
In this section, we introduce relevant encrypted DNS work and
describe our research questions.
The Domain Name System (DNS) al-

lows clients to look up a human-readable domain name to obtain its
IP address [35]. The commonly used DNS protocol uses port 53 (ref-
erenced as “Do53”) and supports unencrypted queries over UDP and
TCP. The fact the DNS remains widely unencrypted raises security
and privacy concerns which have been well-studied, such as connec-
tion eavesdropping or tampering with DNS trac [47]. To secure
DNS, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has proposed and
developed ve major protocols: DNS-over-TLS (DoT), DNS-over-
HTTPS (DoH), DNS-over-QUIC, DNSCrypt, and DNSSEC [47].
Among existing DNS-over-Encryption solutions,
DoH vs. DoT.
DoT and DoH have gained the widest adoption in practice [29].
Both protocols send DNS trac over a TLS connection, with DoH
sending queries in an HTTP GET request. Recent reports show that
DoH has gained more traction than DoT [8, 25], in part because DoH
causes fewer problems with port-oriented rewalls since it uses
port 443 instead of alternate ports (DoT uses port 843 by default) [8].
This also makes DoH more robust to censorship [21], as a censor
is unlikely to block port 443 universally. As DoH seems to be the
most widespread encrypted DNS standard in use today, we focus
primarily on it in this research.
Existing measurement method-
Why Not Existing Methods?
ologies are insucient to answer our research questions. The rst
type of methodology requires direct control over each vantage
point. As a result, the number of vantage points is highly limited
(e.g., a single machine [8] or 5 Amazon EC2 nodes [21]). A recent
work obtained access to 2.6K volunteer nodes from the FCC Mea-
suring Broadband America program, but all of these vantage points
were in the United States [22]. Doan et al. measured the perfor-
mance of DoT using 3.2K RIPE Atlas probes located in residential
networks [16]. However, their measurement only covered DoT, and
the methodology cannot be used for DoH measurement due to the
API restrictions of RIPE Atlas.
Another technique in the literature made use of SOCKS proxy
networks [29] to run DoH and Do53 measurements through a large
number of vantage points. However, because of the lack of control
over the vantage points and involvements of proxy servers (mid-
dleboxes), this method cannot obtain the absolute query latency for
DoH or Do53 [29]. Instead, they can only obtain the dierential. In
addition, their measurement technique only supported DNS-over-
TCP (instead of the more common DNS-over-UDP), and did not

allow them to measure the performance of default resolvers of their
clients.
Dierent from existing works, our methodology aims to (1) cover
a large number of residential vantage points from many countries,
(2) study the behavior of default client resolvers as congured rel-
ative to DoH, and (3) obtain absolute query latency from both
our DoH and Do53 measurements. While we do not expect DoH
to outperform Do53 in terms of latency, we want to study the
performance impact of a transition from Do53 to DoH as it may
disproportionately impact some user populations in certain world
regions compared to others.
The following related questions guide our research:
(1) What is the performance impact on real-world clients of a
switch from traditional Do53 to DoH?
(2) How does this impact dier across countries and geographi-
cal regions?
(3) What external factors or variables explain the performance
asymmetries we observe?
(4) How do public DoH services dier in their architecture, and
how do these dierences aect end clients?
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we describe our measurement methodology to
achieve the goals described above.
3.1 Methodology Overview
To conduct DoH and Do53 measurements, we utilize a proxy ser-
vice called BrightData (formerly known as Luminati) [4] to solicit
measurement vantage points from a large number of countries.
BrightData is a paid HTTPS proxy service that routes trac glob-
