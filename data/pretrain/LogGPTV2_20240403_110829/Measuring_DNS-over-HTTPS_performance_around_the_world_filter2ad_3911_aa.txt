## Abstract
In recent years, DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) has gained significant traction as a privacy-preserving alternative to unencrypted DNS. While several studies have compared DoH performance with traditional DNS and other encrypted DNS schemes, they often focus on single countries or do not compare encrypted DNS to default client behavior. To expand on existing research, we used the BrightData proxy network to gather a dataset from 22,052 unique clients across 224 countries and territories. Our data shows that the performance impact of switching to DoH is mixed, with a median slowdown of 65ms per query over a 10-query connection, but 28% of clients experienced a speedup. We compared four public DoH providers and found that Cloudflare excelled in both DoH resolution time (265ms) and global points-of-presence (146). Additionally, we analyzed geographic differences between DoH and Do53 resolution times, finding that clients from countries with low Internet infrastructure investment are almost twice as likely to experience a slowdown when switching to DoH. We conclude with possible improvements to the DoH ecosystem and hope our findings will inform ongoing DoH deployments.

## 1 Introduction
Over the past few years, several industry actors have advocated for a transition to DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) as a privacy-preserving alternative to traditional, unencrypted, UDP-based DNS (Do53). Mozilla Firefox already defaults to DoH in Firefox for clients in the United States [36], Google has announced a gradual rollout of DoH by default in Google Chrome [6], Microsoft plans to build DoH into both the Edge browser and Windows operating system [34], and Apple has built encrypted DNS into their platforms for developers to integrate [1].

In response to these commitments, prior work has investigated encrypted DNS performance in various ways. Hounsel et al. studied how encrypted DNS affects web browsing using five EC2 nodes [21] and the direct performance impact faced by US clients [22]. Lu et al. studied the reachability and performance of DoH servers to residential nodes around the world [29], though they approximated Do53 behavior using TCP and only with selected resolvers. Inspired by these efforts, our paper focuses on capturing direct comparisons between DoH performance and the default client DNS behavior to assess the performance impact of the transition to DoH. We also seek to understand whether (and how) the transition to DoH would unequally affect clients in different countries and territories. Understanding these differences is key to making equitable rollout decisions for DoH worldwide.

In this paper, we leverage the BrightData (formerly Luminati) [4] residential HTTPS proxy network to conduct DoH and Do53 performance measurements from 22,052 clients located in 224 countries and territories. We developed careful heuristics for measuring DoH and Do53 performance through the BrightData network by instructing clients to resolve fresh domain names under our control (i.e., cache miss performance). This allows us to explore the performance lower-bound for both Do53 and DoH. Through ground truth validation experiments, we demonstrate that our heuristics almost exactly approximate DoH and Do53 performance for BrightData clients, with errors of up to 10ms for DoH and 2ms for Do53. Our results serve as the closest exact measurements of DoH and Do53 performance for residential clients around the world.

We compare DoH measurements from four public resolution services (Cloudflare, Google, NextDNS, Quad9) and default resolution behavior on end-clients. We find that clients globally take a median of 415ms to resolve an initial DoH query, compared to a median of 234ms for a single Do53 query. 19.1% of DoH clients enjoy a speedup in performance even on the first request (despite the TLS handshake), aligned with prior studies suggesting that DoH may outperform Do53 in select cases [20]. For example, clients in Indonesia see their median resolution time drop by 179ms upon switching from Do53 to DoH. Most clients and countries, however, do not enjoy such a speedup. Even after accounting for the initial TLS handshake, clients in Sudan, for example, experience a 264ms median increase in resolution time across the four DoH providers we study. We also examine differences between DoH providers and find that Cloudflare has 36% more points-of-presence (PoP) and resolves queries 21% faster than the next closest DoH resolution service. Additionally, we approximate geographic distances between clients and their resolvers, finding that DoH providers often fail to select the closest PoP for each client, sometimes by large margins. Quad9, for example, only assigns 21% of clients to the closest available PoP, according to our dataset.

To better explain differences in DoH performance around the world, we model DoH and Do53 performance as the outcome of several explanatory variables focused on Internet infrastructure investment, economic development, and DoH infrastructure properties (e.g., resolver choice, PoP placement). We find that countries with low economic development and low Internet infrastructure investment are more likely to experience significant DoH slowdowns compared to Do53. For example, clients from countries with nationwide bandwidth <25Mbps experience a median slowdown of 350ms when transitioning to DoH from Do53, compared to just 112ms for clients in countries with faster Internet speeds. These trends remain significant even when considering multiple requests using a single TLS session for DoH queries, highlighting that while reused connections may slightly dampen the performance cost, they still disproportionately impact countries with fewer economic resources.

We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our measurements on DoH rollout globally and how to support and enable future research in this space. To this end, we provide our dataset [1] in the hopes that it may aid in further research. We hope our results will add context to the discussion surrounding DoH deployment and can inform relevant parties on DoH deployment strategies.

In summary, our contributions are as follows:
1. We conduct measurements of DoH and Do53 performance globally at 22,052 residential clients from 224 countries and directly evaluate the performance cost of switching to DoH from default client DNS behavior. Our dataset will be released at publication time.
2. We show that DoH performance varies for clients around the world, and while most clients would experience only a moderate slowdown, 10% of the clients in our dataset see their resolution times triple as a result of switching from their default resolver to DoH. We find that 8.8% of the countries benefit from a switch to DoH from Do53.
3. We find that a significant number of clients are not being routed to the public resolver PoP nearest to them. For example, 26% of Cloudflare clients could be switched to a PoP at least 1,000 miles closer.
4. We model DoH and Do53 performance as an outcome of several explanatory variables and find that countries with lower Internet infrastructure investment will experience disproportionate slowdowns in a unilateral switch to DoH from Do53.

## 2 Background and Goals
In this section, we introduce relevant encrypted DNS work and describe our research questions.

### The Domain Name System (DNS)
The Domain Name System (DNS) allows clients to look up a human-readable domain name to obtain its IP address [35]. The commonly used DNS protocol uses port 53 (referred to as “Do53”) and supports unencrypted queries over UDP and TCP. The fact that DNS remains widely unencrypted raises security and privacy concerns, such as connection eavesdropping or tampering with DNS traffic [47]. To secure DNS, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has proposed and developed several major protocols: DNS-over-TLS (DoT), DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), DNS-over-QUIC, DNSCrypt, and DNSSEC [47].

### DoH vs. DoT
Among existing DNS-over-Encryption solutions, DoT and DoH have gained the widest adoption in practice [29]. Both protocols send DNS traffic over a TLS connection, with DoH sending queries in an HTTP GET request. Recent reports show that DoH has gained more traction than DoT [8, 25], in part because DoH causes fewer problems with port-oriented firewalls since it uses port 443 instead of alternate ports (DoT uses port 843 by default) [8]. This also makes DoH more robust to censorship [21], as a censor is unlikely to block port 443 universally. As DoH seems to be the most widespread encrypted DNS standard in use today, we focus primarily on it in this research.

### Why Not Existing Methods?
Existing measurement methodologies are insufficient to answer our research questions. The first type of methodology requires direct control over each vantage point, limiting the number of vantage points (e.g., a single machine [8] or 5 Amazon EC2 nodes [21]). A recent work obtained access to 2.6K volunteer nodes from the FCC Measuring Broadband America program, but all of these vantage points were in the United States [22]. Doan et al. measured the performance of DoT using 3.2K RIPE Atlas probes located in residential networks [16]. However, their measurement only covered DoT, and the methodology cannot be used for DoH measurement due to API restrictions of RIPE Atlas.

Another technique in the literature made use of SOCKS proxy networks [29] to run DoH and Do53 measurements through a large number of vantage points. However, the lack of control over the vantage points and the involvement of proxy servers (middleboxes) prevent obtaining absolute query latency for DoH or Do53 [29]. Instead, they can only obtain the differential. Additionally, their measurement technique only supported DNS-over-TCP (instead of the more common DNS-over-UDP) and did not allow measuring the performance of default resolvers of their clients.

Different from existing works, our methodology aims to (1) cover a large number of residential vantage points from many countries, (2) study the behavior of default client resolvers as configured relative to DoH, and (3) obtain absolute query latency from both our DoH and Do53 measurements. While we do not expect DoH to outperform Do53 in terms of latency, we want to study the performance impact of a transition from Do53 to DoH, as it may disproportionately impact some user populations in certain world regions compared to others.

The following related questions guide our research:
1. What is the performance impact on real-world clients of a switch from traditional Do53 to DoH?
2. How does this impact differ across countries and geographical regions?
3. What external factors or variables explain the performance asymmetries we observe?
4. How do public DoH services differ in their architecture, and how do these differences affect end clients?

## 3 Methodology
In this section, we describe our measurement methodology to achieve the goals described above.

### 3.1 Methodology Overview
To conduct DoH and Do53 measurements, we utilize the BrightData (formerly known as Luminati) [4] proxy service to solicit measurement vantage points from a large number of countries. BrightData is a paid HTTPS proxy service that routes traffic globally, providing access to a large and diverse set of residential clients.
