User: i wrote a program using python with PyQT4 and other modules like numpy, scipy etc. under Linux(Ubuntu 9.10). Now i want a executable of this program under Windows 7. I dont want to install Python on the Windows 7 OS.
i try pyinstaller, cx_freeze and py2exe under linux, but i generate only a linux executable which works fine under linux but not working under Windows. 
Now my Questions are.

Is my Task possible or need i to install Python and the needed packages on Windows 7 to generate the executable with pyinstaller for examble?
if it is possible--> how is the solution to solve the problem.

regards lars
Assistant: I only have experience with py2exe and pyqt4, but py2exe needs several dlls which can only exist inside a Windows environment (like Visual C runtime libs or the dlls for Qt). It might be hackable with Wine, but having a Windows environment for packaging everything is the "supported" way.
