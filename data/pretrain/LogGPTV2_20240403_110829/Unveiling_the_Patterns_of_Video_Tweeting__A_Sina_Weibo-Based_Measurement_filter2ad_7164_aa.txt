## Abstract
Sina Weibo is the most popular microblogging service in China, allowing users to share various content types, including text, images, music, and videos. This paper presents a comprehensive measurement study on the patterns of video sharing (video tweeting) on Sina Weibo. We developed a customized measurement platform to collect data from 1 million Weibo users, enabling us to analyze the sources and characteristics of tweeted videos, geographical distribution of viewers, viewing device preferences, and the dynamics of video popularity. Our findings reveal frequent flash crowds for popular videos due to social sharing. Additionally, we observe that the majority of viewers are within three social hops from the original tweet publisher. These insights have significant implications for the design of future social video distribution infrastructures.

## 1. Introduction
Microblogging has become a cornerstone application in the Web 2.0 era, with platforms like Sina Weibo allowing users to post short messages (tweets) of up to 140 characters. Launched in August 2009, Sina Weibo has grown to become the largest microblogging service in China, boasting 300 million registered users by 2012.

Sina Weibo supports the sharing of multimedia content, including videos, through embedded short links. A "Video Tweet" can be created by either uploading a video directly or pasting an external URL. Once published, these tweets are visible to followers in near real-time, who can watch, comment, and retweet the video.

This microblog-triggered video sharing model differs significantly from traditional user-generated content (UGC) sites like YouTube, where content discovery is often driven by search engines and recommendation systems. On Weibo, videos are shared and consumed based on social connections, leading to rapid and granular dissemination. For instance, a single video tweet from a social influencer with millions of followers can generate a flash crowd, causing a sudden surge in video traffic. This poses significant challenges to the underlying video distribution infrastructure.

Despite its importance, there has been limited research on the measurement of video tweeting. This paper aims to fill this gap by conducting a detailed measurement study to understand the characteristics of video tweets and their impact on video distribution.

## 2. Methodology
Given the large scale of Sina Weibo, it is impractical to obtain data from all users. Instead, we sampled a set of one million Weibo users for our analysis. Each registered user on Weibo is assigned a unique user ID (UID), which allowed us to create an unbiased sample by uniformly sampling the UID space. We developed an automated HTTP querying program to verify the existence of each UID, ensuring that only valid user accounts were included in our sample.

Next, we used Sina Weibo's APIs to retrieve all video tweets posted or retweeted by the sampled users during June 2012. To expedite the data collection process, we defined 40 Weibo-based applications and registered 15 accounts for each, allowing us to initiate up to 150 API queries per hour per account. Our custom crawler automatically switched between applications and accounts to maximize efficiency.

From the collected data, we identified 254,135 video tweets, of which 121,366 were unique root video tweets. After filtering out tweets that were never retweeted, we obtained 87,699 active root video tweets. We then collected additional video-related information from corresponding video-sharing websites using a custom crawler. All data were stored in a MySQL database for further processing.

## 3. Patterns of Video Tweeting
### 3.1 Statistics of Tweeted Videos
We analyzed the sources and characteristics of the tweeted videos. By decoding the short video links, we determined the original URLs and categorized the videos by their origins. Figure 1 shows that the majority of video sources are UGC sites, with Tudou (32%), Youku (28%), and Sina Video (10%) being the top three sources. This distribution differs from the market shares of UGC sites, likely due to the collaboration between Sina and Tudou, which allows Weibo users to upload videos directly to Tudou via the Weibo interface.

Figure 2 illustrates the length distribution of the tweeted videos, revealing that most videos are short, with 80% being less than 10 minutes long. This aligns with the typical behavior of Weibo users, who prefer to share short video clips.

### 3.2 Patterns of Viewer Behaviors
To understand viewer behaviors, we collected data on the viewers of the tweeted videos. For each root video tweet, we compiled the Root-level Retweet List (RRL) and Root-level Comment List (RCL). Each retweet in the RRL can also have its own Secondary-level Comment List (SCL). By aggregating the viewers from these lists, we obtained a total of 5,512,130 viewers for 6,500 randomly selected video tweets.

Figure 4 shows the geographical distribution of the viewers, with the majority (97%) being from China. Guangdong (35%), Beijing (7.6%), and Shanghai (7.6%) are the regions with the highest viewer populations. Only 3% of viewers are from outside China.

### 3.3 Popularity Dynamics
We estimated the popularity of a video by summing the number of retweets and comments. As shown in Figure 3, only 1.6% of tweeted videos have more than 10,000 views, while 85% have fewer than 1,000 views. This indicates that most video tweets do not achieve widespread popularity.

## 4. Related Work
While there has been extensive research on traditional UGC sites, little work has focused on the measurement of video tweeting on microblogging platforms. Our study provides a unique perspective on the patterns and dynamics of video sharing on Sina Weibo, highlighting the differences from traditional UGC models.

## 5. Conclusion
This paper presents a comprehensive measurement study of video tweeting on Sina Weibo, providing insights into the sources and characteristics of tweeted videos, viewer behaviors, and popularity dynamics. Our findings suggest that the majority of viewers are within three social hops from the original tweet publisher, and that flash crowds are a common occurrence for popular videos. These insights have important implications for the design of future social video distribution infrastructures.

Further research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing video popularity and the potential strategies for optimizing video distribution on microblogging platforms.
