Abstract. Sina Weibo is the most popular Twitter-like microblog ser-
vice in China. Contents, such as texts, pictures, music, videos, are prop-
agated rapidly by tweeting and retweeting among users. In this paper,
we conduct a measurement study on the patterns of video tweeting over
the Sina Weibo system. We build a customized measurement platform
to collect a huge amount of data (e.g., video tweets, user/video infor-
mation, etc)1 from 1 million Weibo users on the Sina Weibo system.
Our measurements enable us to understand the sources and characteris-
tics of tweeted videos, geographical distribution of viewers, distribution
of viewing devices, popularity dynamics of tweeted videos, etc. We ob-
serve frequent ﬂash crowds occur for popular tweeted videos due to social
tweeting. We also analyze how social links among Weibo users impact
video tweeting and it is found that the majority of viewers are within
3 hops from the original tweet publisher. Finally, we discuss potential
implications of our measurement results on the design of future social
video distribution infrastructures.

Introduction
Microblogging has emerged as a pillar application in the era of Web 2.0. Diﬀerent
from traditional blogs, a microblog user is only allowed to post messages with no
more than 140 characters (referred to as “tweets”). A tweet can be propagated
to a large number of followers timely via the underlying microblog platform. On
Aug 14th, 2009, Sina Inc. launched its own Twitter-like microblog service called
“Weibo”. To date, Sina Weibo [1] has become the largest microblog service in
China, with 300 million registered users by 2012 [2].
Sina Weibo allows the sharing of contents other than texts, such as pictures, mu-
sic, videos, etc, by embedding a short encoded link (e.g., http://t.cn/zOfjzlL)
in a tweet. Such a short link can be decoded into the original URL that points to
the content using Weibo APIs. A tweet that contains a video link is often called a
“Video Tweet ”. A Weibo user can post a video tweet either by directly uploading a

video clip or pasting an external URL in the tweet. Once a video tweet is published,
the followers will see the tweet in a nearly real-time manner. They can watch the
video embedded in the tweet, comment and retweet that video as they wish.
Such microblog-triggered video sharing is inherently diﬀerent from the shar-
ing model of traditional UGC (user-generated content) sites, such as YouTube,
Youku, Tudou, etc. Instead of watching videos suggested by search engines or
recommendation systems, Weibo users tend to watch videos pushed via video
tweets, which are suggested by their friends, social stars, etc. Thus, the spreading
of videos is much faster and happens in a granularity of minutes. For a social star
with millions of followers, one video tweet may bring forth a ﬂash crowd in trig-
gering millions of video views in a very short period. Such kind of sudden surge
of video traﬃc will pose great challenge to the underlying video distribution
infrastructure. However, there has been little work to date on the measurement
of video tweeting. It is of great signiﬁcance to study the characteristics of video
tweets/retweets and their implications on video distribution.
The main purpose of this paper is to investigate video tweeting by real mea-
surements and unveil its impacts on the underlying distribution infrastructure.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to measure the patterns
of video tweeting over the largest microblog system in China. We focus our
measurements solely on video tweets as we are more interested in their impact
on video distribution. We build a customized measurement platform to obtain
tweet/video information from the Weibo system and other video-sharing sites.
By analyzing the obtained data set, we have the following observations:
– We observe that most of tweeted videos are from third-party video-sharing
sites instead of Sina Video itself. Due to the collaboration between Sina and
Tudou, Tudou is the largest source of tweeted videos over Sina Weibo, in
spite that Tudou’s market share is much smaller than that of Yukou. The
length of 80% tweeted videos is less than 10 minutes.
– Our results show that only 3% of viewers of tweeted videos are outside
of China, which implies that Weibo is not an internationalized service as
Twitter. We also ﬁnd that over 30% of viewers are using mobile devices to
watch tweeted videos, with iPhone and Android phones being the top two
widely used devices. Due to the diversity of user devices, it is essential to
provide multiple video versions or adopt realtime transcoding.
– We ﬁnd that the popularity dynamics 2 of top tweeted videos exhibit a clear
ﬂash-crowd pattern, which is a direct consequence of social tweeting. For
87% of tweeted videos, the ﬁrst viewing event occurs within ten minutes
after the tweet is posted. By examining active periods of tweet videos, we
observe that most of active periods are less than 10 hours.
– We measured the propagation distance of tweeted videos and ﬁnd that the
average propagation distance of 98% tweeted videos is within 3 social hops.
2 The popularity of a video is deﬁned as the number of users who have viewed that
video. In our paper, the popularity is estimated by summing up the number of
comments and the number of retweets.

It implies that prefetching videos according to social distance can be an
eﬀective approach to improve user experience.
In the above, we only present some preliminary results from our measurement.
Further work is required to obtain more in-depth understanding. The remainder
of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology of
our measurements. Section 3 shows the patterns of video tweeting. Section 4
introduces related work and explains the diﬀerence of our work. Finally, Section
5 summarizes this paper and discusses potential extensions.
2 Methodology
It is diﬃcult if not impossible to obtain video tweets of all Weibo users due to
the huge scale of Weibo users. Instead, we focus our analysis on a sample set of
Weibo users and their posted video tweets to make the task tractable.
In the Weibo system, each registered user is randomly assigned a unique user
ID (UID) with a length less than 12 digits. Therefore, we can obtain an unbiased
sample of Weibo users by uniformly sampling in the UID space. To verify the
existence of a user account, we develop an automatic HTTP querying program
to query the Weibo system for a given UID. In case that the given UID has been
assigned to a valid user, the system will return the status page of that user;
otherwise, an error page will be returned. By repeatedly generating a random
UID and checking its validness, we obtain a random sample set that consists
of one million Weibo users. The whole sampling process takes nearly ﬁve days.
During the process, all the invalid UIDs are eliminated from the sample set.
Next, we proceed to retrieve all their posted video tweets and analyze the
patterns of video tweeting. Like Facebook, Sina Weibo also provides speciﬁc
APIs to facilitate the development of third-party Weibo-based applications. A
Weibo-based application can obtain tweets and user statistics information via
Weibo APIs. For one third-party application in the development stage, at most
15 accounts are allowed to register for the testing purpose, and each account can
only initiate 150 API queries per hour. To speedup the crawling of video tweets,
we deﬁne 40 Weibo-based applications on the Weibo platform and register 15
accounts for each application. Meanwhile, we modify our crawling program to
automatically switch the application and account when the quota of current
account is exhausted.
Using our Weibo crawler, we retrieve the total video tweets posted or
retweeted by one million users in the sample set during the period from Jun
1, 2012 to Jun 30, 2012. Among all the tweets, there are totally 254,135 video
tweets. By removing duplicated video tweets with same video links (by compar-
ing tweet IDs and URLs) and unavailable video tweets (e.g., deleted by users
themselves or Weibo administrators), we obtain 121,366 root video tweets. Here,
a root video tweet refers to a video tweet directly posted by a user himself, instead
of being retweeted from others’ tweets. Next, we ﬁlter out root video tweets that
have never been retweeted and ﬁnally obtain 87,699 active root video tweets,
which also corresponds to 87,699 unique video links. Starting from these video

links, we collect video-related information (including video length, view count,
etc) from their corresponding video-sharing web sites, such as Youku, Tudou,
Sohu, etc. We again build a customized crawler to conduct the crawling tasks.
Finally, all the collected data are dumped into a mySQL database for data
processing. The whole measurement platform contains around ten machines to
enable parallel crawling and processing.
3 Patterns of Video Tweeting
Next, we will study the features of tweeted videos in the dataset.
3.1 Statistics of Tweeted Videos
By decoding the short video link embedded in the tweet, we are able to extract
the original URL linked to the video. Thus, it is possible to know the source
of tweeted videos. We develop a URL parser to automatically extract all the
original video URLs and categorize videos according to their origins.

Fig. 2. Video length distribution
Fig. 13 shows where tweeted videos are originated. We observe that most of
video sources are UGC sites, such as Tudou, Youku, Sohu, Ku6, etc., among
which Tudou(32%),Youku(28%) and Sina Video(10%) are the top three sources
of tweeted videos on Sina weibo. The statistics are diﬀerent from the published
information on the market shares of UGC sites [3], in which Youku and Tudou
account for 39.1% and 20.3% of China’s Internet video market respectively. We
believe this is mainly caused by the collaboration agreement between Tudou and
Sina [10], in which Sina provides Tudou with a privilege that allows Weibo users
to upload their videos to Tudou via the Weibo interface directly. We also observe
that, although YouTube is the largest UGC video site in the world, YouTube
videos are rarely observed in the video tweets of our dataset, as YouTube is
unaccessible in China if not using VPN or proxies.
3 Fig.1 and Fig.2 are based on the dataset with 87,699 active root video tweets.

Z. Guo et al.
By using our video-sharing site crawler, we further retrieve video length infor-
mation from multiple video-sharing sites, including Tudou, Youku, Sina video,
Sohu video and 56.com. Fig. 2 shows the length distribution of tweeted videos.
It is observed that most of tweeted videos are short videos. The length of videos
from diﬀerent video-sharing sites follows similar distributions. For Tudou, Youku,
Sohu video and 56.com, the length of about 65% tweeted videos is less than 5
minutes and 80% is less than 10 minutes. For Sina video, nearly 30% of tweeted
videos is less than 1 minute, and 80% is less than 5 minutes. It conﬁrms well
with the behaviors of typical Weibo users who are more likely to upload or share
short video clips.
We use the sum of retweets and comments to estimate the popularity of a
tweeted video. In our paper, we make a reasonable assumption that, a Weibo
user will normally only retweet or comment after viewing the video in a tweet.
However, it should be emphasized that the sum of retweets and comments can
only serve as a lower bound of the number of views, as many Weibo users will
not retweet or comment after viewing a video. We randomly select 6,500 videos
from the 87,699 root video tweets and plot the distribution of video popularity
in Fig. 3 4. Only 1.6% of tweeted videos have more than 10,000 views5 and 85%
of tweeted videos have less 1,000 views.

3.2 Patterns of Viewer Behaviors
In the above, we conduct measurements from the perspective of tweeted videos.
In the following, we will study the behaviors of viewers of tweeted videos.
We ﬁrst describe how to obtain all the viewers for a tweeted video. For each
root video tweet, which is the ﬁrst tweet sharing a certain video, there are
two associated lists: one is the Root-level Retweet List (RRL), and the other
is the Root-level Comment List (RCL). For each retweet in the RRL, it can also
have its own comment list, referred as Secondary-level Comment List (SCL).
4 Note that, all other ﬁgures (except Fig.1 and Fig.2) are based on the randomly
selected 6,500 video tweets.
5 In our paper, a view corresponds to a retweet/comment. We use the number of
retweets/comments to estimate the number of views.
Unveiling the Patterns of Video Tweeting
171
Each retweet will appear in the RRL and each comment will appear in either
RCL or SCL. All the Weibo users who appear in one of the above three lists
are most likely to have viewed the video; otherwise, they will not retweet or
comment on that video. Our Weibo crawler can travel through the RRL, RCL
and SCL of each video tweet, and aggregate all the viewers for that video. Later,
the parser will remove all the duplicated viewers to avoid the issue of double
counting.
For popular tweeted videos, the above process is time-consuming due to
the limitation of Weibo APIs. Without impacting the conclusion, we randomly
choose 6,500 tweeted videos from all the 87,699 videos and analyze their viewers’
behaviors. Starting from these 6,500 tweeted videos, we ﬁnally obtain 5,512,130
viewers by crawling their RRL, RCL and SCL lists. For each viewer (also a Weibo
user), we again query the Weibo system to retrieve the viewer’s information, such
as location, following/followed list, etc.
Fig. 4 depicts geographical distribution of 5.5 million viewers. Most of the
viewers are from China, with only 3% of viewers are from other countries. Guang-
dong (35%), Beijing (7.6%) and Shanghai (7.6%) are the top three regions with
the largest viewer population. Only 3% of viewers are outside of China.
