have been subjected to automated attacks over the years
[16, 18, 41, 45, 47]. Tam et al. analyzed the security of au-
dio CAPTCHAs from popular websites by using machine
learning techniques and were able to break many of them,
including an earlier version reCAPTCHA [47]. In 2017, Bock
et al. proposed an automated system called unCaptcha that
could break reCAPTCHA’s audio challenges with an accuracy
above 85% [16]. In 2017, Solanki et al. proposed a low-cost
attack against several popular audio CAPTCHAs using off-
the-shelf speech recognition services [45].
10 Conclusion
CAPTCHAs have become a standard security mechanism
for protecting websites from abusive bots. In this work, we
showed that one of the Internet’s most widely used image
CAPTCHA schemes, reCAPTCHA v2, could be broken by
an automated solver based on object detection method with a
high success rate. Our extensive analysis showed that despite
several major security updates to counter automated attacks,
which could invalidate prior image recognition and classiﬁ-
cation based solvers, reCAPTCHA remains vulnerable to ad-
vanced object detection systems. Given the capabilities of the
current object detection systems, we think that reCAPTCHA

is essentially broken because its reverse Turing tests to dis-
tinguish humans from bots are easily solvable by an object
detection based automated solver.
