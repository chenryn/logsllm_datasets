## Abstract
EPC (Electronic Product Code) tags are industry-standard RFID devices poised to replace optical barcodes in many applications. This paper explores the systemic risks and challenges associated with the increasing use of EPC for security applications. As a central case study, we examine the recently issued United States Passport Card and Washington State's "enhanced drivers license" (WA EDL), both of which incorporate Gen-2 EPC tags. We identify multiple weaknesses, including susceptibility to cloning, extended read ranges, and the ability to remotely disable a WA EDL. We analyze the implications of these vulnerabilities on overall system security and provide recommendations for improvement. We also demonstrate anti-cloning techniques for off-the-shelf EPC tags, overcoming practical challenges in a previous proposal to co-opt the EPC "kill" command for tag authentication. Our research fills a gap in the experimental evaluation and guidance for EPC tag security, not only in identity documents but also in broader authentication contexts.

## 1. Introduction
EPC (Electronic Product Code) tags are RFID devices designed to replace optical barcodes in various applications. Currently, EPC tags are most commonly used in supply chain management, tracking cases and pallets. Proponents envision a future where individual items are tagged, enabling automation from manufacturing to retail and recycling.

One significant application of EPC tags is in U.S. identity documents for border crossings. The United States Passport Card (PASS Card), introduced in 2008, incorporates an EPC tag. This card was issued in response to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), which phased out document exemptions for border crossing. Some states, such as Washington and New York, have issued or plan to issue Enhanced Drivers Licenses (EDLs) that comply with WHTI and use EPC tags.

The only EPC standard ratified by EPCglobal, the body overseeing EPC development, is the Class-1 Gen-2 tag, referred to as "Gen-2" or "EPC" in this paper. These tags are attractive due to their low cost (under ten U.S. cents each) and long read range (tens of feet under optimal conditions).

### 1.1 Our Contribution: Vulnerability Analysis
The deployment of EDLs and Passport Cards at international borders is one of the first and most prominent uses of EPC RFID tags in security applications. We evaluate the use of EPC tags in this context, examining low-level security features and their significance in real-world scenarios. Through our research, we uncovered several attacks, some of which may be applicable in other countries or if proper procedures are not followed.

#### Context
In its final rule on the Passport Card, the Department of State acknowledged concerns about security and privacy. The Department justified the use of EPC tags for their long read range and simultaneous reading capabilities, and noted that the Passport Card meets ISO security standards. The cards do not contain personally identifiable information and are issued with protective sleeves to prevent unwanted scanning.

#### Experiments: Cloning
In mid- to late-2008, we obtained a Passport Card and two Washington State EDLs for our experiments. We found that the publicly readable data in both types of identity documents can be easily cloned after a single read. Specifically, Passport Cards and Washington State EDLs do not carry unique TIDs, but instead use generic manufacturer codes. This makes their contents susceptible to direct copying into another off-the-shelf EPC tag.

Tags contain some private data in the form of PINs, which could theoretically enable weak access-based authentication. However, this is not an explicitly supported feature for EPC tags. Other techniques, such as detecting unique radio fingerprints, are possible but have not been shown to work with EPC tags.

#### Experiments: Readability
We explored the read ranges of EPC tags in different physical environments. Both Passport Cards and EDLs can be read at distances of at least 50 meters under optimal conditions. Surprisingly, an EDL in a wallet near the body can still be scanned from a distance of at least two meters. While the Passport Card is not readable in a well-maintained protective sleeve, it can be read in a crumpled sleeve. An EDL in a protective sleeve is readable at a distance of tens of centimeters.

These findings have implications for both cloning and owner privacy, as the unique serial numbers in the tags can support clandestine tracking.

#### Other Attacks
We also found evidence that EDLs are vulnerable to denial-of-service and covert-channel attacks due to the lack of protection for the PIN used in the "kill" command. These flaws, along with the heightened susceptibility to in-sleeve scanning, suggest either design drift or the risks of implementing technology before finalizing security requirements.

### 1.2 Our Contribution: Countermeasures and Recommendations
The security impact of tag vulnerabilities depends on the operational environment. Copying a Passport Card or EDL does not automatically ensure successful use at a border crossing, as the card is linked to a back-end system with a photo of the bearer. We discuss the systemic significance of the vulnerabilities identified.

We argue that EPC-enabled identity documents play a critical role in the border-crossing process, potentially giving undue influence to the EPC layer of the security system. Even if these documents provide adequate security at border crossings, they create a system dependent on well-conceived and tightly executed procedures.

To improve cloning resistance, we explore methods for co-opting the elementary security features of EPC tags. We demonstrate that the "kill" command can be used for tag authentication, though it presents technical challenges. Our findings provide valuable guidance for deploying EPC tags in various security applications beyond border-crossing, such as anti-counterfeiting and secure item pedigrees for pharmaceutical supply chains.

## 2. Related Work
Several studies have addressed RFID security, including radio-layer cloning attacks, reverse engineering, and brute-force key-cracking attacks. Grunwald cloned an RFID-enabled passport, and Juels, Molnar, and Wagner evaluated the security implications of e-passport cloning. Some commercial RFID tags include strong cryptography, but these tend to be expensive and have limited range. Juels proposed techniques for authenticating EPC tags using the KILL and ACCESS commands, which we implement and evaluate in Section 4.

For a more detailed discussion of how our results interact with the operational environment of Passport Cards and EDLs, see the corresponding technical report [23].

## 3. Experimental Evaluation of Passport Card and EDLs
### 3.1 Weakness in the TID-based Anti-Cloning Mechanism
EPC tags contain a Tag Identifier (TID) field, which can be factory-programmed and locked to ensure unique identities. However, the Gen-2 standard only requires the TID to identify the manufacturer and tag capabilities. Two classes of TIDs are defined: E0h, with a 48-bit serial number, and E2h, which only identifies the manufacturer and model.

Our experiments show that the TIDs in Passport Cards and Washington State EDLs do not confer anti-counterfeiting benefits, as they use generic manufacturer codes. This makes the tags vulnerable to cloning.
