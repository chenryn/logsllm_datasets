User: I have a Python script I recently wrote that I call using the command line with some options. I now want a very thin web interface to call this script locally on my Mac.
I don't want to go through the minor trouble of installing mod_python or mod_wsgi on my Mac, so I was just going to do a system() or popen() from PHP to call the Python script.
Any better ideas? Thanks in advance!
Assistant: I do this kind of thing all the time for quick-and-dirty scripts.  It's quite common to have a CGI or PHP script that just uses system/popen to call some external program.
Just be extra careful if your web server is open to the internet at large.  Be sure to sanitize your GET/POST input in this case so as to not allow attackers to run arbitrary commands on your machine.
