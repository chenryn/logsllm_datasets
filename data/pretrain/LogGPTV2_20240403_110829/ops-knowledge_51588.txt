**User:**

I recently wrote a Python script that I execute from the command line with various options. Now, I would like to create a simple web interface to run this script locally on my Mac.

To avoid the minor hassle of setting up `mod_python` or `mod_wsgi`, I was considering using PHP's `system()` or `popen()` functions to call the Python script. 

Are there any better approaches? Thanks in advance!

**Assistant:**

This is a common approach for creating quick and simple web interfaces for scripts. It's quite typical to use a CGI or PHP script that calls an external program via `system()` or `popent()`.

However, if your web server is accessible from the internet, it's crucial to be extra cautious. Ensure that you sanitize all input from GET and POST requests to prevent attackers from executing arbitrary commands on your machine.
