### Company X: Security Assessment of SCADA Systems

#### Identified Vulnerabilities
- **Poorly Secured Wireless**: Allowed unauthorized access to the corporate internal network.
- **Flat Network Structure**: The corporate network was found to be a single, large flat network, increasing the risk of lateral movement.
- **Direct Access to SCADA Systems**: Corporate desktops on the LAN had direct access to SCADA systems.
- **Unpatched SCADA Management Systems**: Windows hosts used for SCADA management were unpatched, making them vulnerable to known exploits.
- **Dial-In Lines**: Several dial-in lines to SCADA communication processors were discovered, providing potential entry points.
- **Default Passwords**: Default manufacturer passwords provided access to several SCADA systems.

#### General Conclusions
- **Interconnected World**: It was commonly believed that SCADA networks were isolated. In reality, there are numerous connections, including dial-in networks, radio backdoors, wireless, LAN connections, and dual-homing via support laptops.
- **Insecure by Design**: 
  - **Anonymous Services**: Telnet and FTP services were often left anonymous.
  - **Weak Passwords**: Passwords were either default or simple and rarely changed.
  - **Lack of Access Controls**: Firewalls were not used due to concerns about delays impacting real-time responses.
  - **Clear-Text Protocols**: All protocols were in clear text, prioritizing speed over confidentiality.
- **Lack of Authentication**: There was no authentication at all, with automated systems not requiring users and OPC on Windows needing anonymous DCOM rights.
- **Patching Challenges**: SCADA systems traditionally do not get patched, leading to a very large vulnerability window.

#### Misunderstood Security Model
- **Different Security Model**: SCADA systems have a different security model compared to traditional IT networks, which can lead to misunderstandings and inadequate security measures.

#### The Way Forward
- **Growing Standards**: There are an increasing number of standards and practical guides from organizations like NIST and NSA.
- **Common Sense and Best Practices**: Many security measures are based on common sense and industry best practices.

#### Practical Steps for Securing SCADA
1. **Identify All Connections**:
   - Internal LAN, WAN, and business networks.
   - Internet and wireless network devices (radio, satellite).
   - Modem or dial-up connections.
   - Connections to vendors, regulatory services, or business partners.
   - Conduct a thorough risk analysis and understand how these connections are protected.

2. **Disconnect Unnecessary Connections**:
   - Isolate the SCADA network from other networks to maximize security.
   - Use DMZs and data warehousing to securely transfer data between SCADA and business networks.

3. **Conduct Physical Security Surveys**:
   - Identify and secure all physical access points, including remote telephones, cables, fiber optic links, terminals, and wireless/radio devices.
   - Ensure all remote sites connected to the SCADA network are included in the survey.

4. **Implement Intrusion Detection and Incident Response**:
   - Enable alerting for suspicious activity.
   - Implement logging on all systems.
   - Develop and maintain incident response procedures.

5. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Regularly conduct penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
   - Implement firewalls, IDS/IPS, and perform regular audits.

6. **SCADA-Specific Solutions**:
   - Consider using specialized SCADA IDS/Firewall solutions like Industrial Defender, which understand protocols such as DNP3 and MODBUS.
   - Utilize IPS functionality for virtual patching.

7. **Harden SCADA Networks**:
   - Remove unused services, especially those involving internet access, email, and remote maintenance.
   - Work with SCADA vendors to identify and implement secure configurations.
   - Follow guidelines from organizations like the NSA.

8. **Implement Vendor-Provided Security Features**:
   - Newer SCADA systems often include security features, but they may be turned off by default.
   - Ensure strong authentication is used for all communications.
   - Address vulnerabilities in modem, wireless, and wired network connections.

9. **Basic Security Measures**:
   - Backups and disaster recovery.
   - Background checks for personnel.
   - Limit network access based on the principle of least privilege.
   - Defense-in-depth strategies.
   - Training staff to avoid social engineering.

10. **Avoid Security Through Obscurity**:
    - Do not rely on unique, proprietary protocols for security.
    - Demand transparency from vendors regarding backdoors and interfaces.
    - Insist on systems that can be secured.

#### Conclusion
- **Current Threat Landscape**: While the threat of SCADA-based attacks is currently overblown, it is likely to become more serious in the coming years.
- **Collaborative Effort**: Addressing these issues requires a collaborative effort between asset owners, vendors, and regulatory agencies.
