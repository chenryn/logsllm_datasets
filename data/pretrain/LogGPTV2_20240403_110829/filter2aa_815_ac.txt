 Poorly secured wireless allowed access to Corporate Internal
 Corporate Network was found to be one large flat network
 Direct Access to SCADA systems from corporate desktop LAN
 SCADA management systems unpatched windows hosts
 Several dial-in lines to SCADA communcations processors were
discovered
 Default manufacturer passwords provided access to several

SCADA (in)Security
From these examples what general conclusions can we draw?
© 2007 Security-Assessment.com
SCADA (in)Security
It’s a Brave New Interconnected World
 It was a commonly held belief that SCADA networks were
isolated
 In reality there are frequently NUMEROUS connections
 Dial-in networks, radio backdoors, wireless, LAN connections,
dual-homing via support laptops, connected to corporate LAN
for ease of management and convenient data flow

SCADA (in)Security
Insecure By Design
 Anonymous services - telnet/ftp (no users remember?)
 Passwords default or simple, NEVER changed
 Access controls not used as Firewalls cause delays which can
impact responses which must happen in real-time
 All protocols clear-text. Speed more important confidentiality

SCADA (in)Security
Lack of Authentication
 I don’t mean lack of strong authentication.  I mean NO AUTH!!
 There’s no “users” on an automated system
 OPC on Windows requires anonymous login rights for DCOM
(XPSP2 breaks SCADA because anonymous DCOM off by default)
 Normal policies regarding user management, password rotation
etc etc do not apply

SCADA (in)Security
Can’t Patch, Won’t patch
 SCADA systems traditionally aren’t patched
 Install the system, replace the system a decade later
 Effects of patching a system can be worse than the effects of
compromise?
 Very large vulnerability window

Just Misunderstood
SCADA has a different security model to traditional IT Networks

The Way Forward
Good things happening in SCADA security
 There are a growing number of standards in SCADA Security
Some excellent practical guides a la NIST from NSA and other
critical infrastructure groups.
Let’s do some good!

Securing SCADA
Disconnect Unnecessary Connections to SCADA Networks
Isolate the SCADA network from other network connections to get
the highest degree of security possible.
 While connections to other networks allow efficient and
convenient passing of data, it’s simply not worth the risk.
Utilisation of DMZs and data warehousing can facilitate the secure
transfer of data from SCADA to business networks.

Intrusion Detection and Incident Response
 To be able to respond to cyber-attacks you need to be able to
detect them
 Alerting of suspicious activity for network administrators is
essential
 Logging on all systems
 Incident response procedures must be in place to allow effect

Conduct penetration testing
 There’s no substitute for having an actual human attempt an

interconnected with other networks
Remove unused services especially those involving internet access,

"The threat from a Red Team is real... If someone exposes a
control system security flaw, I’ll make my best effort to patch it in a
timely fashion. But I’m not capable of hardening our system to the
point where I can anticipate and deal with such attacks.
In the scheme of every day threats, this one doesn’t rate. We’re
paid to defend against the likely and knowable threats – not the
possibility of attack by a nation state. I can’t harden my control
system against another nation state. I can’t put our operators
through that degree of security. I have to worry about the lower
tech approaches first. Who can get at the UPS for example…
We don’t have guards with submachine guns and flak vests
guarding our plants. We don’t have military grade security software
either. That’s what we pay taxes for.  I hate to say this, …I have
other far more likely scenarios to worry about.”

Any access to internal network at all can be escalated to full control
of SCADA
 No sophisticated attacks required
 Poor, missing, weak or reused passwords
 Plenty of helpful documentation lying around
 Physical access to network ports = SCADA

Don’t Rely on Security Through Obscurity
Some SCADA systems use unique, proprietary protocols
 Relying on these for security is not a good idea
Demand that vendors disclose the nature of vendor backdoors or
interfaces to your SCADA systems
Demand that vendors provide systems that can be secured!

Conclusion
IMHO, the threat of SCADA-based attacks are overblown today, but
will become more serious in the coming years.
The FUD shouldn’t be overwhelming
This is not something asset owners can do on their own!
It is something that vendors need to address based on pressure
from asset owners and regulatory agencies.
