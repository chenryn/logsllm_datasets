## Abstract
The increasing ubiquity of WiFi access points, combined with the widespread use of smartphones, suggests that Internet connectivity is becoming available everywhere and at all times. Even with 3G connectivity, devices are designed to switch automatically to WiFi networks to enhance user experience. This is often achieved by periodically broadcasting automatic connectivity requests (known as Probe Requests) to known access points (APs), such as "Home WiFi" or "Campus WiFi." In large gatherings, the number of these probes can be very high. This scenario raises a natural question: "Can significant information on the social structure and socioeconomic status of a large crowd be inferred from smartphone probes?"

In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question. We conducted a three-month campaign, collecting approximately 11 million probes from over 160,000 different devices. We targeted national and international events, as well as other large gatherings. We present a simple and automated methodology to construct the underlying social graph of smartphone users based on their probes. Our analysis reveals that these social graphs exhibit typical social network properties. Additionally, we show that important sociological aspects, such as language and vendor adoption, can be inferred from the probes.

## 1. Motivation and Goals
WiFi access points (APs) are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in homes, offices, and public places. Initially, APs were used to free portable computers from wired connections. Today, they offer a fast and cost-effective connectivity option for mobile devices, which often switch to WiFi whenever possible. Modern smartphone operating systems store the SSIDs of frequently connected networks and periodically broadcast these SSIDs in the form of Probe Requests to search for available networks. This process occurs every few seconds, even when far from known APs. In a large crowd, a high number of probe requests are sent every minute. 

This paper addresses the following questions:
- What information can be derived from a large crowd's probe requests?
- Can we infer important information about the crowd, such as its social structure or socioeconomic status?
- Can this analysis be done in a simple and automated way?

To answer these questions, we organized a three-month probe collection campaign, targeting large gatherings at city-wide, national, and international events, as well as a university campus. Using only commodity hardware, we collected 11,136,711 probes from 164,740 unique devices.

Our main contributions and findings include:
- A simple and automated methodology to extract social connections among smartphone owners, revealing the underlying social network of participants.
- Analysis of the social graph properties, showing that they feature typical social network attributes.
- Important sociological information, such as language distribution and vendor adoption, can be inferred from the probes.
- Validation of sociological theories of homophily and social influence in the context of smartphone vendor adoption.
- Temporal analysis of data from a long-term university campus deployment, showing a strong correlation between device co-occurrence and the strength of the inferred relationships.

An anonymized version of the dataset is available online [41]. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work, Section 3 introduces our data collection methodology and target events, Section 4 presents our main findings, and Section 5 draws conclusions and discusses future work.

## 2. Related Work
The use of probe requests for discovering nearby WiFi networks has recently gained attention. Security concerns have been raised, with studies showing how probe requests can expose users to man-in-the-middle attacks and privacy risks. Additionally, probe requests have been used for WiFi monitoring and user tracking. Previous work has focused on inferring relationships between pairs of users, but we take a different approach by focusing on large-scale events involving thousands of users. We aim to build a snapshot of the society represented by the participants, reflecting their sociological features and the properties of the emerging social network.

## 3. Data Collection Methodology
According to the 802.11 standard, WiFi access points announce their presence by broadcasting beacons containing network configuration parameters, including the SSID. Client devices can detect access points through passive or active scanning. Active scanning involves sending Probe Requests, which can be directed to specific networks or broadcast to any network within range. 

### 3.1 Probes Collection: Technical Details
Mobile devices send probe requests with a frequency that varies by vendor, typically between 15 and 60 seconds. Intercepting probe requests is straightforward, requiring only commodity hardware like a laptop's internal wireless card set in monitor mode. 

**Hardware Used:**
- 4 × MacBook Pro equipped with a Broadcom BCM43xx card
- 1 × ThinkPad X61 equipped with an Atheros network card
- 1 × Fixed external Ubiquity SuperRange Cardbus antenna

Overall, we collected around 11 million probes from approximately 160,000 unique devices across eight different events and locations. After data collection, we used tshark to filter out corrupted probes and built a database associating each device (identified by MAC address) with the list of SSIDs derived from its probes.

### 3.1.1 Description of the Datasets
Rome hosts several important events with national and international audiences. Our data collection campaign targeted the following scenarios:
1. National audience events
2. International audience events
3. Events with mostly local residents
4. Train station
5. University campus
6. Other (e.g., commuting)

The first four were one-shot events lasting from 40 minutes to 6 hours. Data collection was carried out by a team of five researchers using laptops. The fifth dataset was collected continuously over six weeks using fixed hardware on a university campus. The last dataset includes probes collected during various activities, such as commuting.

### 3.1.2 National Events
We targeted political meetings of two major Italian parties: Movimento Cinque Stelle (M5S) and Popolo della Libertà (PDL). The M5S meeting on February 22, 2013, in Piazza San Giovanni (denoted as Politics 1) and the PDL meeting on March 23, 2013, in Piazza del Popolo (denoted as Politics 2) attracted participants from all over Italy.

### 3.1.3 International Events
We collected data during Pope Benedict XVI's farewell Angelus on February 24, 2013, and Pope Francis' first Angelus on March 17, 2013, in Vatican City. These datasets are denoted as Vatican 1 and Vatican 2, respectively.

### 3.1.4 City-wide Probes: The Mall
We targeted Porta di Roma, one of the largest malls in Rome, on March 30, 2013, to collect data from local residents. The data collection lasted 3.5 hours.

### 3.1.5 Train Station
We targeted Termini, the central train station in Rome, and collected probes for a total of 7 hours over four days.

### 3.1.6 University
We deployed an antenna at a fixed point on the university campus and collected probes continuously for six weeks, primarily from students entering and leaving the campus.

### 3.1.7 Others
This dataset consists of probes collected individually by three members of our research group during various activities over four weeks.

### 3.1.8 All
Our final dataset, denoted as All, combines all the previously described datasets. We use this dataset for global statistics.

## 4. Data Analysis
Our objective is to show how WiFi probe requests collected in large events or specific areas reveal insights into the sociological characteristics of the crowd. We use a methodology combining social network analysis techniques, sociological theories, and natural language processing.

### 4.1 Vendors of the Devices in the Datasets
The mobile device market is dynamic, with vendors regularly launching new products. We grouped the over 160,000 devices by vendor and computed the percentage of devices for each vendor. The most common vendors in our datasets are Apple (57% of devices), Samsung (17%), Nokia (6%), HTC (1%), Sony (1%), and RIM (1%). These results, while not necessarily measuring market penetration, are qualitatively similar to those obtained from other studies.

| Dataset | Devices | PNLs (%) |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Politics 1 (P1) | 16,695 | 4,677 (28.0%) |
| Politics 2 (P2) | 12,619 | 4,144 (32.8%) |
| The Mall (M) | 9,731 | 3,859 (39.7%) |
| Train Station (TS) | 14,640 | 5,371 (36.7%) |
| University (U) | 17,131 | 8,853 (51.7%) |
| Vatican 1 (V1) | 23,430 | 7,631 (32.6%) |
| Vatican 2 (V2) | 22,219 | 6,817 (30.7%) |
| Others | 60,445 | 21,824 (36.1%) |
| All | 164,740 | 59,684 (36.2%) |

## 5. Conclusions and Future Work
In this work, we demonstrated that WiFi probe requests can provide valuable insights into the social structure and socioeconomic status of large crowds. Our methodology allows for the automated construction of social graphs, revealing typical social network properties and important sociological information. Future work will focus on refining the methodology and exploring additional applications of this data.
