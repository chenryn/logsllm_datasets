Using pandas 0.13.1
I have a dataframe with three columns. The first two contain datetimes and the
third floats (the entire data frame originates from df =
pandas.io.sql.frame_query(...,...) ).
I need to remove rows for which dates in the first two columns are duplicated.
So something like the following would seem to be appropriate:
    df = df.groupby(['col1','col2']).first() 
    df.reset_index(inplace = True)    
However, this doesn't work: it executes without error, but returns df
unmodified.
I can get the functionality I need by first converting the datetimes to
strings:
    df['col1'] = [date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for date in df['col1']]
    df['col2'] = [date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for date in df['col2']]
Only after this, it seems, do the original commands work:
    df = df.groupby(['col1','col2']).first() 
    df.reset_index(inplace = True)   
Then to get back to the dataframe format I need, I have to revert back to
datetimes:
    df['col1'] = to_datetime(df['col1'])
    df['col2'] = to_datetime(df['col2'])
