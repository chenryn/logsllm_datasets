I am reporting as a bug, although it might be my bad code, but could not
figure it out... Might be useful for future searches.
I am trying to split my fixtures into multiple files.  
I get an error pointing to the base.extend  
Error: test.extend() accepts fixtures object, not a test object.  
Did you mean to call test._extendTest()?

### Source code
    //fake-time.fixtures.ts
    import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
    export type FakeTimeFixtures = {
      useFakeTime: (dateTime: string) => Promise
    };
    export const fakeTimeFixtures = base.extend({
      useFakeTime: async ({ page }, use) => {
        const addFakeTimeScript = async (dateTime: string): Promise => {
          const fakeNow = new Date(dateTime).valueOf();
    //implementation code
          }`);  
        };
        await use(addFakeTimeScript);
      }
    });
    //fixtures.ts
    import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
    import { fakeTimeFixtures, FakeTimeFixtures } from './fake-time.fixtures.ts';
    type MyFixtures = {
      someFixture: (component: Locator) => Promise;
    };
    export const test = base.extend ({
    ...fakeTimeFixtures
    someFixture: // implementation of the fixture
    });
    export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
I am not even sure if it is a TS or a PW error. Any idea?
