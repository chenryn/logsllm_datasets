Abstract
A lattice ciphertext policy attribute based encryption
(CP-ABE) scheme is presented, in which the ciphertext
policy achieved is the AND-gates on multi-valued at-
tributes. The previous construction with AND-gates on
multi-valued attributes as ciphertext policy is based on bi-
linear paring technology. In this paper, inspired by the re-
cent progress of lattice identity based encryption scheme,
we achieve this access structure from lattice technology.
There are two constructions given, and both of them can
be viewed as an extension and generalization of the lattice
identity based encryption schemes proposed by Agrawal et
al., respectively. In addition, our constructions are shown
to be secure under the learning with errors assumption in
the standard model.

1 Introduction
The notion of attribute based encryption was ﬁrst intro-
duced by Sahai and Waters [18] at EUROCRYPT’05. In
their scheme, a sender can generate a ciphertext according
to an attribute set ω and a user described by an attribute
set γ can get a private key from the authority. When at
least d (threshold parameter) attributes overlapped be-
tween ω and γ, the user is allowed to decrypt this cipher-
text. The above scheme achieves threshold access struc-
ture. At present, some access structures of more com-
plexity are achieved. Attribute based encryption scheme
can be viewed as a generalization of identity based en-
cryption (IBE) [8, 19, 21]. Substantially, the notion of
attribute based encryption integrates an access structure
with the notion of identity based encryption.
There are two approaches for an attribute based
encryption scheme to deploy access control policy.
One is Key-Policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE)
scheme [13, 15, 20] ﬁrst proposed by Goyal et al. [13].
In their cryptosystem, ciphertexts are labeled with sets
of attributes, and private keys are identiﬁed by a tree-
access structure in which each interior node of the tree
is a threshold gate and the leaves are associated with at-
tributes. This access tree control which ciphertexts a user
is able to decrypt. The other approach to deploy policy is
ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE)
schemes [6, 7, 16, 22].
In these schemes, a message is
encrypted with a speciﬁc access policy determined by the
encrypter, and private keys issued by a trusted authority
are labeled with sets of attributes. Decryption requires
that the attribute set of a user matches the cipertext pol-
icy. There are many applications for both types of ABE
systems, such as sharing of audit-log and broadcast en-
cryption. In addition, all the above schemes are shown
to be secure in the selective model. Lewko et al. [14]
proposed an attribute based encryption scheme which is
secure in the full model.
Lattice-based cryptography has many appealing prop-
erties, for example, it can be implemented eﬃciently and
it is believed to be secure against quantum computer.
Notice that there are several lattice identity based en-
cryption schemes proposed.
In [12], the author gives a
construction of lattice IBE in the random oracle model
by using trapdoor functions with preimage sampling. In
the standard model, Cash et al. [10], Agrawal et al. [1]
(denoted by ABB-1) and Agrawal et al. [2] (denoted by
ABB-2) present eﬃcient constructions for lattice IBE. At
present, attribute based encryption schemes are mainly
built on the technique of bilinear map. Recently, lattice
ABE achieved some progresses [3, 9, 23].
In this work, we present a lattice ciphertext policy
attribute based encryption scheme and give two corre-
sponding constructions. The ciphertext policy achieved
is AND-gates on multi-valued attributes. We notice that
this access structure has been used before in [11] for con-
structing an attribute based encryption scheme, which has
constant length of ciphertext. The previous construction
with AND-gates on multi-valued attributes as ciphertext
policy is based on bilinear paring technology. In this pa-
per,
inspired by the recent progress of lattice identity
based encryption scheme, we achieve this access struc-
ture from lattice technology. Both of the constructions
can be viewed as an extension and generalization of the
lattice identity based encryption schemes in [1] and [2], re-
spectively. In the ﬁrst construction, a uniformly random

q is chosen to represent an attribute value
vi,j, where i ∈ [N], j ∈ [Ni], and we map attribute vectors

described in [1]. Based
q
on the above, we can compute
vi,j∈L H(ui,j) for some
attribute list L due to the domain of H forms an additive
group. However, the private key for a user in this con-
struction is a vector e ∈ Z2m. Furthermore, we give an-
other construction, which is based on the lattice identity
based encryption scheme in [2] and is a ﬁx dimension lat-
tice ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption scheme
(i.e., e ∈ Zm). Thus, this construction has short private
key.
If we view the original lattice IBE in [2] as a lat-
tice ABE supporting And-gates on two-valued attributes
(i.e., 1 or 0), our construction extends it to a lattice ABE
that achieves And-gates on multi-valued attributes.
In
addition, both our constructions are shown to be secure
under the learning with errors assumption in the stan-
dard model. Note that the access structure achieved in
this paper is relatively simple, and it is the future work
for achieving access structure of more complexity.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
2 we recall some preliminaries. In Section 3 we describe
our ﬁrst construction and prove its security. The second
construction and it’s proof for security are presented in
Section 4. Finally, we conclude in Section 5.
2 Preliminaries
In this section, we describe some preliminaries for our
scheme. Throughout the paper, we say i ∈ [n] means
that i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let S = {s1, s2, . . . , sj} be a set of
vectors. The notation (cid:107)S(cid:107) denotes the (cid:96)2 length of the
longest vector in S, (cid:101)S denotes the Gram-Schmidt orthog-
onalization of S and (cid:107)(cid:101)S(cid:107) denotes the Gram-Schmidt norm
of S.
2.1 Access Structure and Ciphertext Pol-
icy Attribute based Encryption
Access structure.
In our scheme, the policy that we
achieved is AND-gates on multi-valued attributes. This
access structure has been used before in [11] and is
deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 1. Let U = {att1, att2, . . . , attN} be a set of
attributes. For atti ∈ U, Si = {vi,1, vi,2, . . . , vi,Ni} is a
set of possible values, where Ni is the number of possible
values for atti. Let L = [L1, L2, . . . , LN ], Li ∈ Si be an
attribute list for a user, and W = [W1, W2, ..., WN ], Wi ∈
Si be an access structure. The notation L (cid:178) W expresses
that an attribute list L satisﬁes an access structure W ,
namely, Li = Wi(i = 1, 2, . . . , N).
value vi,∗ from Si = {vi,1, vi,2, . . . , vi,Ni} for each atti ∈ U.
Ciphertext policy attribute based encryption.
For-
mally, a ciphertext policy attribute based encryption
scheme consists of
four polynomial-time algorithms
described as follows [16]:
• Setup: This algorithm takes as input the security
parameter κ and generates a set of domain parame-
ters consisting of a public parameter P P and a mas-
ter secret key M K. It is a randomized algorithm.
• KeyGen: Given the public parameter P P , the mas-
ter secret key M K and an attribute list L for a user,
this algorithm generates a user secret key SKL asso-
ciated with L. It could be probabilistic.
• Encrypt: On input of the public parameter P P , an
access structure W and a message M, this algorithm
outputs a ciphertext C. It should be probabilistic.
• Decrypt: On input of a user secret key SKL and a
ciphertext C for a message M encrypted under an ac-
cess structure W , this algorithm outputs the message
M if L (cid:178) W .
In our scheme, each ciphertext is encrypted for a mes-
sage bit b ∈ {0, 1}. Thus, M in the above description of
algorithms means a message bit b.
The security model of our scheme is modiﬁed from
the model in [1] and is deﬁned by using the following
selective security game. This game captures a strong
privacy property that it is indistinguishable between
the challenge ciphertext and a random element in the
ciphertext space.
Selective security game for our lattice CP-ABE:
• Init. The adversary declares an access structure W ∗,
that he wishes to be challenged upon.
• Setup. The challenger runs the Setup algorithm of
the scheme and gives the public parameters P P to
the adversary.
• Phase 1. The adversary is allowed to issue private
key queries for any attribute list L, where L (cid:50) W ∗.
The challenger runs algorithm KeyGen to obtain a
private key SKL and returns it to the adversary.
• Challenge. The adversary submits a message bit
b∗ ∈ {0, 1}. The challenger ﬂips a random coin r
and chooses a random ciphertext C in the ciphertext
space. If r = 0, it sets the challenge ciphertext C∗ =
Encrypt(P P, W ∗, b∗). Otherwise (i.e., r = 1), it
sets challenge ciphertext C∗ = C. It sends C∗ to the
adversary.
Note that the total number of access structures is
ΠN
i=1Ni. To generate a ciphertext under some access
structure W , an encryptor has to explicitly indicate a
• Phase 2. Phase 1 is repeated.
• Guess. The adversary outputs a guess r(cid:48) of r.

The advantage  of an adversary A in this game is deﬁned
as |Pr[r(cid:48) = r] − 1
2|. In addition, the adversary does not
declare an access structure W ∗ before the Setup stage
in the adaptive security game.
Deﬁnition 2. A lattice ciphertext policy attribute based
encryption scheme is secure in the selective model if all
polynomial-time adversaries have at most a negligible ad-
vantage in the above game.
2.2 Integer Lattices and the Gram-
Schmidt Norm of a Basis
In this section, we give some deﬁnitions that are directly
related to our construction. For further information
(such as the discrete Gaussian distribution over lattice),
the reader is referred to previous literatures [1, 2, 10, 12].

The set of the vectors b1, b2, . . . , bm is a basis of the lattice
Λ. In addition, if deﬁne the m × m matrix B by letting
his columns are b1, b2, . . . , bm, we have equivalently
Λ = L(B) = L(b1, b2, . . . , bm) = {Bx|x ∈ Zm}.
Further, it is called integer lattice when Λ ⊆ Zm.

2.3 Learning with Errors
We reduce the security of our constructions to the
learning with errors (LWE) problem, which is a hard
problem on lattices deﬁned in [17]. Here, we follow the
description in [1].
Deﬁnition 4. Consider a prime q, a positive integer n,
and a distribution X over Zq, all public. An (Zq, n,X )-
LWE problem instance consists of access to an unspeciﬁed
challenge oracle O, being, either, a noisy pseudo-random
sampler Os carrying some constant random secret key s ∈
q , or, a truly random sampler O$, whose behaviors are

tributed persistent value invariant across invocations,

The (Zq, n,X )-LWE problem allows repeated queries to
the challenge oracle O. We say that an algorithm A
decides the (Zq, n,X )-LWE problem if |P r[AOs = 1] −
P r[AO$ = 1]| is non-negligible for a random s ∈ Zn
q .
The noise distribution ¯Ψα is deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 5. ([1]) Consider a real parameter α =
α(n) ∈ (0, 1) and a prime q. Denote by T = R/Z the
group of reals [0, 1) with addition modulo 1. Denote by
Ψα the distribution over T of a normal variable with mean
0 and standard deviation α/
2π then reduced modulo 1.
Denote by (cid:98)x(cid:101) = (cid:98)x + 1
2(cid:99) the nearest integer to the real
x ∈ R. We denote by ¯Ψα the discrete distribution over
Zq of the random variable (cid:98)qX(cid:101) mod q where the random
variable X ∈ T has distribution Ψα.
√
In [17], the author shows that the (Zq, n, ¯Ψα)-LWE
problem is hard for certain noise distributions ¯Ψα by us-
ing a quantum reduction.
Theorem 2. ([17]) If there exists an eﬃcient, pos-
sibly quantum, algorithm for deciding the (Zq, n, ¯Ψα)-
LWE problem for q > 2
n/α then there exists an eﬃ-
cient quantum algorithm for approximating the SIVP and
GapSVP problems, to within ˜O(n/α) factors in the (cid:96)2
norm, in the worst case.

3 Our Construction based on the
ABB-1 Scheme
This construction is based on the lattice IBE in [1]
and makes use of their sampling algorithms.
In the
construction, the authority can generate private keys
for all user by using the algorithm SampleLeft.
In
the simulation, the simulator can use SampleRight to
respond the private key queries made by the adversary.
We refer the reader to previous literature for the concrete
deﬁnitions of those two algorithms. The inputs and
outputs of the algorithms are as follows.
