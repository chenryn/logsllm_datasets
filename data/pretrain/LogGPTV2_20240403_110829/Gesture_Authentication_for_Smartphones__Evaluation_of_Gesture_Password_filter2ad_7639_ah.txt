n-GRAM STROKE DISTRIBUTIONS IN FIRST STUDY
APPENDIX D
Figure 10 depicts the stroke distribution in the three n-gram models chosen in the Ô¨Årst study. Bias in the start stroke direction
is towards rightwards and downwards, while center strokes tend to be short and Ô¨Ånal strokes are more likely to involve rightward
motion.

Fig. 10. Distribution of strokes in optimized 2x10 (top row), 3x10 (center row) and 4x12 (bottom row) n-gram models in the Ô¨Årst study. Left column shows
data from start strokes, right column shows data from Ô¨Ånal strokes and all other strokes are shown in the center column. Each Ô¨Ågure is divided into the
discretization regions available in the given n-gram model, with the frequency of sub-strokes observed in each region marked in % and by color. Boundary
regions are shown to scale as grey areas for both length and angle. The proportion of strokes used in each region (black text) and boundary (grey text) is
shown at the boundary (for angles) and the bottom of each diagram (for lengths).

n-GRAM STROKE DISTRIBUTIONS IN SECOND STUDY
APPENDIX E
Figure 11 depicts stroke distribution in n-gram models generated for all four policies in the second study. Bias in the start
stroke direction is greatest in baseline. Center strokes are short while Ô¨Ånal strokes tend to be rightward.

Fig. 11. Distribution of strokes in baseline (top row), lexical (center-top row) and blacklist (center-bottom row) and consolidated (bottom row) n-gram models
in the second study. Each model uses the conÔ¨Åguration of the optimized 3x10 model from the Ô¨Årst study. Left column shows data from start strokes, right
column shows data from Ô¨Ånal strokes and all other strokes are shown in the center column.
