### Participant Feedback and Suspicions
Participants were informed that they had been randomly divided into two groups, with one group being subject to manipulation. They were then asked which group they believed they were in. In reality, all participants experienced the manipulation according to their assigned group.

Following this, we provided hints about the true purpose of the experiment, informing them that the goal of the manipulation was to take over one of their accounts. We then asked again which group they thought they were in. Before posing this question a third time, we specified that the account targeted for takeover was a Facebook account.

### Ethical Considerations
We faced an ethical dilemma regarding the best way to conduct this experiment. We could have spoofed the Facebook messages and avoided contacting Facebook directly for the SMS group. However, we decided to simulate a real attack to ensure the experiment accurately reflected a practical PRMitM (Password Reset Man-in-the-Middle) attack. This decision was made because the interaction between the attacking page and the attacker's server, and between the server and Facebook, takes time and could raise suspicion. We did not actually take over any Facebook accounts or save the codes typed by the users; we only verified the correctness of the codes with the participants.

### Participants
Eighty-eight volunteer students from our institute participated in the experiment. Forty-two were assigned to the Facebook SMS group, and the remaining forty-six to the detailed SMS group. We used volunteers to ensure they felt free to leave the experiment at any time. None of the participants were involved in other experiments or surveys related to this research.

### Results
The attack was successfully completed on 90.5% of the Facebook SMS group and 79.5% of the detailed SMS group. Only four participants stopped the experiment and refused to send their Facebook password reset code to our server. Approximately 50% of the participants in both groups did not realize they were under attack even after being told that half of the participants' Facebook accounts had been hacked. The hints helped participants understand the situation, but those in the detailed SMS group were quicker to suspect a security issue. Figure 2 illustrates these results.

### Analysis of Results
The results demonstrate that a PRMitM attack can be launched automatically. We interviewed participants who did not stop the attack to gain insights into their behavior. Two key findings emerged:

1. **Code Search Without Reading**: Many users simply searched for the code without reading the message. Some read the code from the notification without opening the message.
2. **Misinterpretation of Sender Identity**: Users who noticed the message was from Facebook assumed it was part of the login process using the "Login with Facebook" mechanism. This suggests that the sender identity is less important if the message content is unclear. Adding phrases like "Powered by Facebook" or specifying the sender might make SMS spoofing more effective.

Based on this feedback, we designed mechanisms to prevent such issues. See Section VII-B for details.

### V. PRMitM via Phone Call
This section discusses PRMitM attacks that exploit password resets through phone calls. We compare the use of SMS and phone calls in password reset processes and highlight the vulnerabilities found. Google, the most popular website, serves as an example to illustrate these vulnerabilities.

#### A. SMS Code vs. Phone Call
There are several security aspects to consider when comparing password reset processes using SMS and phone calls:

- **Sender Identifier**: SMS spoofing allows the attacker to manipulate the sender identifier, while phone calls typically come from unrecognized numbers.
- **Message Length**: SMS codes are limited in length, often lacking sufficient information. Phone calls can deliver longer, more detailed messages.
- **User Attention**: Reading a code from an SMS requires minimal effort, whereas a phone call demands more attention and concentration.
- **Language Issues**: SMS codes can be understood in multiple languages, but phone calls require basic language comprehension.
- **Interactivity**: Phone calls allow for interactive verification, making them more suitable for ensuring user understanding.

#### B. Vulnerable Websites
Websites that support password reset via phone calls may be vulnerable to PRMitM attacks. Secure phone calls should include the initiating website, the password reset process, and a warning about disclosing the code.

Among the top 100 websites surveyed, Google, LinkedIn, eBay, and Netflix support both SMS and phone call password resets. PayPal supports only phone calls. We found that LinkedIn and Google are vulnerable. LinkedIn's phone call does not mention LinkedIn, and Google's phone calls vary by language. The English group (German, French, Russian, Italian, and Persian) mentions Google and includes a warning, while Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, and Hebrew versions are more vulnerable due to the lack of sender identification and warnings.

#### C. Evaluation: PRMitM on Google Phone Calls
Experiment 3 evaluated the PRMitM attack on Google users via phone calls. Due to ethical reasons, we did not complete the password reset process with the received codes. Instead, we tested the possibility of resetting passwords on our own accounts, verifying that it is possible under the experimental conditions.

**Experiment 3: Effectiveness of PRMitM Attack on Google Users Using Phone Calls**

- **Experiment Process**: Similar to Experiment 2, we informed participants that we would call them instead of sending an SMS. We initiated a password reset request with Google, requiring only the email address of the victim. We also asked for the phone number to avoid suspicion.
- **Ethics**: We continued to face the ethical dilemma from Experiment 2. We decided to initiate a genuine Google call and did not save the codes typed by the users, only verifying their correctness.
- **Participants**: Sixty-eight volunteer students participated, with 39 using English and the rest using vulnerable languages.
- **Results**: All participants in the vulnerable group failed to detect the attack. In the English group, only 7 participants (18%) blocked the attack, while 59% realized after hints and 23% did not realize they were manipulated. Figure 3 shows these results.
- **Analysis**: The English phone call was surprisingly vulnerable. Participants who failed to stop the attack cited the lack of clarity about the code's meaning. Based on this, we designed and evaluated a secure phone call to prevent the attack. See Section VII-C for details.

### VI. Mobile Application Vulnerabilities
Previous sections discussed various PRMitM attack variants on popular websites. We also audited mobile messaging applications to identify similar vulnerabilities.

#### A. Survey: Password Reset in Mobile Messaging Applications
We audited the password reset processes of popular messaging applications. Table V lists the applications and supported channels for password reset. Telegram is the only application that supports password reset via the application itself, followed by SMS and phone calls.

#### B. Mobile Applications PRMitM Vulnerabilities
In addition to the lack of application-based password reset, we found the following vulnerabilities:
- **Vulnerable Phone Calls**: WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Telegram have phone calls that do not indicate the source, explain the code's meaning, or warn against sharing the code. See Table VI for examples.

These findings highlight the need for improved security measures in mobile applications to prevent PRMitM attacks.
