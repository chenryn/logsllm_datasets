Hi, just going through the Golang tour (very cool, btw) and was confused by
the sentence "To learn more about defer statements read this blog post."
because there was no link to a blog post. Then I realized that "blog post" was
an undecorated link. It would be clearer if the link were underlined or
somehow called out.
