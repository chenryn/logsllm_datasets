User: How to install, configure and use Nginx as a web server in Linux system?
Assistant: Here are the steps to install, configure, and use Nginx as a web server in a Linux system: 1. Install Nginx Use the following command to install Nginx in a Linux system: Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx CentOS/Fedora /RHEL: sudo yum install nginx 2. Start Nginx Use the following command to start Nginx: sudo systemctl start nginx 3. Configure Nginx The main configuration file of Nginx is /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. You can edit this file to configure various options such as listening ports, virtual hosts, SSL certificates, etc. Example configuration file: user www-data; worker_processes auto; pid /run/nginx.pid; events { worker_connections 768; # multi_accept on; } http { ## # Basic Settings ## sendfile on; tcp_nopush on; tcp_nodelay on; keepalive_timeout 65 ; types_hash_max_size 2048; server_tokens off; # server_names_hash_bucket_size 128; # server_name_in_redirect off; include /etc/nginx/mime.types; default_type application/octet-stream; ## # SSL Settings ## ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; # Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; ## # Logging Settings ## access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log; error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log; ## # Gzip Settings ## gzip on; gzip_disable "msie6"; ## # Virtual Host Configs ## include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf; include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*; } 4. Configure the virtual host in /etc/ Create a virtual host configuration file in the nginx/sites-available/ directory. These files should end with a .conf extension. You can use a symbolic link to link it to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ so that Nginx can load them. Example virtual host configuration file: server { listen 80; server_name example.com; return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; } server { listen 443 ssl; server_name example.com; root /var/www/example.com; index index.html index.htm; ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem; ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404; } } 5. Reload Nginx after changing Nginx configuration After that, you need to reload Nginx to apply the changes. This can be done with the following command: sudo systemctl reload nginx Now you can use Nginx as your web server.
