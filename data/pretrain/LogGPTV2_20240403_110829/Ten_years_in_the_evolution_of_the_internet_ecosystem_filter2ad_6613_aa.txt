ABSTRACT
Our goal is to understand the evolution of the Autonomous Sys-
tem (AS) ecosystem over the last decade. Instead of focusing on
abstract topological properties, we classify ASes into a number of
“species” depending on their function and business type. Further,
we consider the semantics of inter-AS links, in terms of customer-
provider versus peering relations. We ﬁnd that the available historic
datasets from RouteViews and RIPE are not sufﬁcient to infer the
evolution of peering links, and so we restrict our focus to customer-
provider links. Our ﬁndings highlight some important trends in the
evolution of the Internet over the last decade, and hint at what the
Internet is heading towards. After an exponential increase phase
until 2001, the Internet now grows linearly in terms of both ASes
and inter-AS links. The growth is mostly due to enterprise net-
works and content/access providers at the periphery of the Inter-
net. The average path length remains almost constant mostly due
to the increasing multihoming degree of transit and content/access
providers. In recent years, enterprise networks prefer to connect
to small transit providers, while content/access providers connect
equally to both large and small transit providers. The AS species
differ signiﬁcantly from each other with respect to their rewiring
activity; content/access providers are the most active. A few large
transit providers act as “attractors” or “repellers” of customers. For
many providers, strong attractiveness precedes strong repulsiveness
by 3-9 months. Finally, in terms of regional growth, we ﬁnd that
the AS ecosystem is now larger and more dynamic in Europe than
in North America.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet, as a network of Autonomous Systems (ASes), re-
sembles in several ways a natural ecosystem. ASes of different
sizes, functions, and business objectives form a number of AS species
that interact to jointly form what we know as the global Inter-
net. ASes engage in competitive transit (or customer-provider) re-
lations, and also in symbiotic peering relations1. These relations,
which are represented as inter-AS logical links, transfer not only
trafﬁc but also economic value between ASes. The Internet AS
ecosystem is highly dynamic, experiencing growth (birth of new
ASes), rewiring (changes in the connectivity of existing ASes), as
well as deaths (of existing ASes). The dynamics of the AS ecosys-
tem are determined both by external “environmental” factors (such
as the state of the global economy or the popularity of new Internet
applications) and by complex incentives and objectives of each AS.
Speciﬁcally, ASes attempt to optimize their utility or ﬁnancial gains
by dynamically changing, directly or indirectly, the ASes they in-
teract with. For instance, the objective of a transit provider may be
to maximize its proﬁt, and it may approach this goal through com-
petitive pricing and selective peering. The objective of a content
provider, on the other hand, may be to have highly reliable Internet
access and minimal transit expenses, and it may pursue these goals
through aggressive multihoming and an open peering policy.
Our study is motivated by the desire to better understand this
complex ecosystem, the behavior of entities that constitute it (ASes),
and the nature of interactions between those entities (AS links).
How has the Internet ecosystem been growing? Is growth more
important than rewiring in terms of the formation of new links?
Is the population of transit providers increasing (implying diver-
siﬁcation of the transit market) or decreasing (consolidation of the
transit market)? Given that the Internet grows in size, does the aver-
age AS-path length also increase? Which ASes engage in aggres-
sive multihoming? What is the preferred type of transit provider
for AS customers? Which ASes tend to constantly adjust their set
of providers? Are there regional differences in how the Internet
evolves? These are some of the questions we ask in this paper.
Understanding the evolution of the Internet ecosystem is impor-
tant for several reasons. First, we believe that there is a need to
1We refer to “settlement free interconnection” as a “peering rela-
tion” and “paid transit” as a “customer-provider” relation.
develop bottom-up models of Internet topology evolution that cap-
ture the complex interactions between the constituent entities. As
such, it is necessary to study the differences between the types of
ASes that form this ecosystem in terms of business function and
incentives. Second, understanding the evolution of the Internet is
critical for studying the performance of protocols and applications
over time. For instance, to answer the question “How will BGP
perform 10 years from now?” we ﬁrst need to answer the question
“How will the Internet look 10 years from now?”. Third, there is
much recent interest in generating synthetic AS graphs for simu-
lation and analysis. A study of the evolution of the Internet can
provide valuable inputs to such topology generators, such as the
types of ASes in the Internet and their topological and behavioral
properties over time. Finally, in light of the recent interest in re-
designing the Internet with “clean-slate” approaches, it is crucial to
understand how the existing Internet has evolved. Doing so could
help us identify new architectures and mechanisms that have an in-
trinsic capability to evolve towards desirable economic, reliability
and performance conditions.
There is an extensive literature on AS-level topology measure-
ment and modeling (reviewed in detail in Section 8). A large por-
tion of that literature, however, takes a graph-theoretic perspective,
viewing all ASes as nodes in a graph and all inter-AS relations as
edges, without considering the type of relation (customer-provider
versus peering) or the role of the participating ASes (customer ver-
sus provider). Viewing all ASes as the same type of node ignores
the major differences in the function and objectives of different
ASes. Further, even though most of the previous work on AS-level
topology modeling mentions the terms ‘evolution” or “dynamics”,
the main focus has been on measurements and modeling of growth,
ignoring rewiring. The latter is very important, however, as it rep-
resents the attempt of individual ASes to optimize their connectiv-
ity. Finally, most of the earlier work on AS-level topologies has
focused on macroscopic properties and metrics, such as the degree
distribution, the clustering coefﬁcient or the graph diameter, with-
out considering the local policy and semantics of inter-AS relations.
The latter are very important as they control the ﬂow of trafﬁc and
value in the AS ecosystem.
In this paper, we attempt to measure and understand the evolu-
tion of the Internet ecosystem during the last decade (1998-2007).
We propose a method to classify ASes into a number of types de-
pending on their function and business type, using observable topo-
logical properties of those ASes. The AS types we consider are
large transit providers, small transit providers, content/access/hosting
providers, and enterprise networks. We are able to classify ASes
into these AS types with an accuracy of 80-85%. We focus on
primary inter-AS links, meaning links that are used under “nor-
mal operating conditions”, to distinguish with backup links that
appear under failure conditions or routing convergence. We also
consider the semantics of inter-AS links, in terms of customer-
provider (CP) versus peering (PP) relations, and distinguish be-
tween the customer, provider and peering role of an AS in each
relation. Unfortunately, we ﬁnd that the available historical datasets
from RouteViews and RIPE are not sufﬁcient to infer the popula-
tion and evolution of peering links. So we restrict the focus of
this study to the evolution of the population of AS types and of
customer-provider links.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we
describe the data collection and ﬁltering methodology. In Section 3,
we focus on the evolution of the global Internet. In Section 4, we
present a classiﬁcation scheme of ASes into four AS types based on
their expected business function. Then, we examine the evolution
of each AS type at a global scale as well as regionally. In Sections 5
and 6, we investigate the evolution of customer-provider relations
in the Internet, from the perspective of the customer and provider,
respectively. In Section 7, we present some results on the evolution
of the Internet peering ecosystem. These results should be viewed
as “conjectures” because of the limitations in detecting the com-
plete set of peering links. We discuss related work in Section 8 and
conclude with a summary of our main ﬁndings in Section 9.
2. DATASETS AND METHODOLOGY
A study of the evolution of the Internet ecosystem needs frequent
snapshots of the AS-level Internet topology, annotated with policy
information for each link. Given that such historical information is
not available, we have to rely on measurement and inference, col-
lecting data from multiple sources and considering the limitations
of each dataset. This section describes the datasets we use and the
subsequent ﬁltering and validation processes.
We collected BGP AS-paths from BGP table dumps obtained
from the two major publicly available repositories at RouteViews [30]
and RIPE [29]. The RouteViews collection process started in Novem-
ber 1997, providing an invaluable resource in the past ten years.
The ﬁrst RIPE collector became active in October 1999. We rely
only on these two repositories because no other source of topo-
logical/routing data (routing registries, traceroutes, looking glass
servers, etc.) provides historical information. Note that the use of
AS-paths has been shown to be inadequate to expose the complete
Internet topology [9, 10, 18]. In particular, even though most ASes
are detected, a signiﬁcant fraction of peering and backup links at
the edges of the Internet are missed [8, 18, 37].
In fact, it has
been estimated that there are at least 40% more peering links in the
Internet than those obtained from AS-paths [8, 10]. We are well in-
formed of these limitations, which are further exposed later in this
section. There are, however, three important points to consider.
First, we do not aim to detect backup links; instead, we are only
interested in primary Internet links, used most of the time (as op-
posed to backup links that are only used upon failures or overload
conditions). We describe later how to avoid backup links in the
data ﬁltering process. Second, the main focus of this evolutionary
study is customer-provider links. As we show later in this section,
the available monitors from RouteViews and RIPE are not enough
to detect all peering links or the births and deaths of those links.
Third, even though missing links can be detrimental for complex
inference applications (such as AS path prediction or BGP root-
cause analysis), it has been shown recently that they are less critical
in topology inference [38].
Filtering of backup and transient links: Next, we describe how
to only detect primary links, avoiding backup links and false AS-
paths that often appear during BGP convergence. First, note that
short-term failures and routing transient events can “confuse” an
evolutionary study, misinterpreting link disappearances and appear-
ances due to transient failures as link deaths and births respectively.
For instance, suppose that the primary link lp between AS-x and
AS-y fails at time t1, causing the activation of a backup link lb
between AS-x and AS-z. lp is repaired at t2 and the connectivity
returns to its original state. Since we focus on primary links, our
goal is to ignore the transient event during (t1, t2) and to not detect
lb. On the other hand, a change of routing policy that exchanges the
role of links lp and lb (so that lb becomes the primary link) should
be detected as the death of lp and the simultaneous birth of lb.
To achieve the previous objective we follow the “majority ﬁlter-
ing” approach described next. Note that a snapshot, in the follow-
ing discussion, does not refer to a time instant but to a period of
21 days. During a certain snapshot, we collect at N different times
the unique AS-paths that are exported from all active RouteViews
and RIPE monitors. The period between these successive samples
is Ts, with N Ts=21 days. Then, we keep only those AS-paths that
appear in the majority of the samples and ignore the rest. This
process is designed to ﬁlter out links that appear due to routing
transient events, as well as due to “hard” failures of interdomain
links (e.g. due to router crashes or ﬁber cuts). Routing transients
typically persist for less than a few hours, while it is reasonable to
expect that hard failures are repaired within 10 days. In each of
these cases, the majority ﬁltering rule successfully ﬁlters out the
transient links.2 Note that if a certain link X-Y is used as primary
in one AS path but as backup in another path, it will be included in
our snapshot.
To select an appropriate value of N, we do the following. We
collect all visible AS-paths for each day of January 1998. Next, we
divide the month into N blocks of the same duration, and collect
the set of visible AS-paths from a randomly selected instant in each
of the N blocks. Then, we perform majority ﬁltering, considering
only AS-paths that appear in the majority of the N samples. Fi-
nally, we measure the number of visible AS links. We vary N from
1 to 10, and repeat the previous process multiple times for each
value of N. As N increases, the average number of visible links
decreases (from about 5850 to 5725 during that month) because
fewer backup links become visible. Additionally, the variability in
the number of visible links decreases. We observe that N=5 results
in about the same average as higher values of N, and reasonably
low variance (standard deviation of 12 links). In the rest of this
study, N=5 samples.
The trade-off behind the selection of the snapshot duration (21
days in our study) is explained next. If the snapshot duration is too
long (say more than a month), then we may miss several birth-death
(or death-birth) transitions of the same link. On the other hand, if
the snapshot duration is too small (say a few days), then the major-
ity ﬁltering mechanism may not be able to ﬁlter out backup links
that appear during long-lasting failures such as ﬁber cuts. Finally,
a new snapshot is collected every three months, providing us with
40 snapshots (10 years) from January 1998 to October 2007.
Variations in the number of active monitors: Another issue we
need to consider is that the number of BGP monitors in both Route-
Views and RIPE has been increasing signiﬁcantly over the last ten
years, from about 10 in 1997 to almost 400 at the end of 2007.
The increase in the number of monitors has been less than 20%
in 35 out of the 39 pairs of successive snapshots. As the number
of monitors increases, some previously existing links may become
visible for the ﬁrst time at a certain snapshot. How do we distin-
guish those ﬁrst appearances of existing links from genuine link
births? Similarly, sometimes monitors are removed. How do we
distinguish between the disappearance of existing links from gen-
uine link deaths? Also, can we bound the estimation error in the
number of link births and deaths between each pair of successive
snapshots?
To answer the last question we perform the following analysis.
Let the set of monitors at snapshots T1 and T2 be M1 and M2
respectively. Let L1 and L2 be the set of links observed at T1
and T2, respectively. L2 − L1 is the set of new link appearances
between T1 and T2. This is our estimate for the set of new link
births. This set includes the links that were genuinely born between
T1 and T2, but it may also include an error term that is the set of
links that were present at T1 but became visible at T2 due to the
monitor set increase. To derive an upper bound for the latter, we do
the following.
First, determine the set of links L(cid:3)

sidering an AS-path only if it appears in all N samples.

2 − L1 (where L(cid:3)
using the set of monitors that were common between M1 and M2,
i.e., M1 ∩ M2. The set L(cid:3)
2 − L1 ⊆ L2 − L1)
includes links that were deﬁnitely born between T1 and T2, and
hence it gives a lower bound on the number of actual link births. On
the other hand, the number of links in the set (L2−L1)−(L(cid:3)
2−L1)
is an upper bound for the error between the estimated and actual
number of link births. So, the worst case relative error (WCRE) in
the number of link births between T1 and T2 is:

of the 39 snapshots pairs, the WCRE is less than 10%. For all
but one pair, the WCRE is less than 20%.
In the remainder of
this paper, we omit the pair of snapshots for which the WCRE was
larger than 20% (Jan-Apr 2000). We also measured the WCRE
separately for customer-provider (CP) links and peering (PP) links.
Unfortunately, the WCRE is very high for peering links and in 9
out of 39 snapshots it is greater than 100%. On the other hand,
the WCRE for CP links is quite low, and for all except one pair of
snapshots (Jan-Apr 2000), it is less than 10%.3
The previous analysis considers the effect of an increased set of
monitors on the measurement of link births. A similar problem oc-
curs while measuring link deaths, as some monitors are occasion-
ally disconnected temporarily or permanently from the RouteViews
and RIPE collectors. We performed a similar analysis to determine
the effect of monitor deaths on the estimated number of link deaths.
We ﬁnd that the WCRE in the estimated number of link deaths is
less than 10% for 37 out of the 39 snapshot pairs.
The previous WCRE analysis showed that, even though we can
estimate well (within 10%) the link births/deaths of CP links, we
do not get a reasonable accuracy for the link births/deaths of PP
links. This is a negative but signiﬁcant result, which should be con-
sidered by future studies that rely on RouteViews and RIPE topo-
logical data. It also implies that the conclusions of several previous
topological studies should be re-examined.
Sensitivity of population counts to number of monitors: We
next examine the visibility of CP and PP links, as well as of ASes,
when we vary the number of used monitors. Consider ﬁrst the pop-
ulation of ASes. Let nAS be the set of visible ASes if we use all
available monitors at a given snapshot. We then randomly select a
fraction f of the available monitors, and determine the population
of ASes that is visible using that subset of monitors. We repeat this
experiment 100 times, and determine for each run the number of
ASes visible with a fraction f of the available monitors nAS(f ).
Figure 1 shows the median, 10th and 90th percentile values of the
ratio nAS(f )/nAS for the snapshot Jan 2007, together with the
corresponding ratios for the populations of CP links and PP links.
We repeated this analysis for all snapshots, and the results are quan-
titatively similar across time, without any noticeable trends.
Notice that the number of visible ASes is strongly insensitive to
the number of available monitors. Even with 10% of the moni-
tors we practically see the same set of ASes that is visible with all
monitors. The fraction of CP links is also insensitive to the num-
ber of available monitors, as long as we use more than 60-70% of
the available monitors in the given snapshot. So, we expect that a
10-20% increase in the number of available monitors across succes-
sive snapshots will not cause a signiﬁcant variation in the number
of visible CP links. The situation is very different with PP links
however. The fraction of visible PP links increases roughly lin-
early with the fraction of used monitors. This means that if we had
3Note that the WCRE is calculated for every pair of snapshots, and
so it does not accumulate over time.
more monitors we would probably see signiﬁcantly more PP links.
So, the estimated population size of PP links should be viewed as
lower bound on the actual population size. Similar observations
were recently reported by Oliveira et al. [26].
The previous observations have two major implications. First, on
the positive side, it appears that the RouteViews and RIPE histor-
ical datasets contain enough monitors to detect the ASes and CP
links in a robust manner. Even though we cannot be certain that
we see all ASes or CP links, we at least have evidence that these
populations would not differ by a large number if we had more
monitors. Second, on the negative side, it is clear that the Route-
Views and RIPE datasets are not sufﬁcient to detect the population
or the birth/death rates of PP links. Consequently, in the rest of
the paper we focus on the evolution of CP links. When we present
some results for PP links, the reader should recall that those ﬁgures
are lower bounds on the actual number of PP links.

Policy inference: After collecting and ﬁltering the data as de-
scribed earlier, the ﬁnal data processing step is to use the AS-paths
in each snapshot (those that passed the majority ﬁltering process)
to infer the underlying AS topology and the relationships between
