User: Everything was functioning correctly, but now when I run the `pelican content` command, nothing happens; the command line simply hangs. What could be causing this issue?

Assistant: The problem appears to be related to the `PAGE_PATHS` value in your settings file. It seems that setting `PAGE_PATHS` to `[""]` is not valid. Changing it to `pages` resolved the issue.
