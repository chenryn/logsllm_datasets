**Abstract:**
Current methods for monitoring botnets to facilitate their disruption or takedown often result in inaccurate data collection or detection by the C&C orchestrators. To address this, we explore an evolving pattern in modern malware that incorporates over-permissioned protocols, providing privileged access to C&C servers. Our study involved 200,000 malware samples captured since 2006, revealing that nearly one-third (62,202) are over-permissioned bots, with 443,905 C&C monitoring capabilities. The use of over-permissioned protocols has steadily increased over the past 15 years. We present C3PO, a pipeline that automates the identification of over-permissioned protocols, infiltration vectors, and C&C monitoring capabilities, enabling covert and scalable C&C server monitoring. Our findings suggest that over-permissioned protocols offer a viable and efficient method for covertly monitoring C&C servers, which is crucial for botnet disruptions and takedowns.

**Introduction:**
Botnet disruptions and takedowns require accurate and covert monitoring of Command and Control (C&C) servers before and after any action is taken. Current techniques can be categorized into passive and active monitoring. Passive monitoring, such as sensor node injection, provides coarse-grained insights but requires significant reverse engineering. Active monitoring, including remote penetration testing and domain seizure, is more effective but is easily detectable. This research proposes leveraging over-permissioned protocols, which are increasingly used by botnets, for covert and scalable C&C server monitoring.

Previous attempts at botnet disruption and takedown have relied on C&C server monitoring to gather evidence and obtain legal permission. Accurate monitoring is essential for profiling the botnet and validating the success of takedown efforts. Over-permissioned protocols, combined with the trust C&C servers place in their bots, provide a scalable opportunity for covert monitoring through protocol infiltration.

**Motivating Example:**
Consider Sanny, an APT targeting government agencies. After infection, Sanny uses over-permissioned FTP APIs for C&C communication. In 2018, authorities manually analyzed Sanny's new variant, discovering FTP APIs and authentication credentials. However, they did not leverage this information for covert C&C server monitoring. Using C3PO, we identified FTP APIs, extracted infiltration vectors, and monitored C&C server activities, demonstrating the potential for covert monitoring.

**Measurement Pipeline:**
C3PO is an automated pipeline designed to study the adoption of over-permissioned protocols in malware. Our dataset includes 200,000 malware samples collected over 15 years. C3PO consists of four phases:
1. **Dynamic Memory Image Extraction:** Captures memory images during malware execution to bypass packing and obfuscation.
2. **Over-Permissioned Bot Identification:** Identifies invocation points for protocol APIs and tokens.
3. **Infiltration Vector Identification:** Uses Iterative Selective Symbolic Execution (iSSE) to extract infiltration vectors.
4. **C&C Monitoring Capabilities Identification:** Reveals the composition and content of C&C servers.

**Conclusion:**
C3PO provides a scalable and automated solution for covert C&C server monitoring by leveraging over-permissioned protocols. Our findings highlight the prevalence of over-permissioned protocols in malware and their potential for covert monitoring, which is essential for effective botnet disruptions and takedowns.
