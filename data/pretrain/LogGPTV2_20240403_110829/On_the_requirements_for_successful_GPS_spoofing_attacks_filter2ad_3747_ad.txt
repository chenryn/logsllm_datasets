antennas of the attacker. As the intersection of two hyperboloids
yields a spaced curve, the intersection of three hyperboloids is an
intersection of this curve with a third hyperboloid, which results
in at most two points. We can also arrive at this number of solu-
tions by considering the system of four quadratic equations based
on Equation 7. These can be transformed into three linear and one
quadratic equation [1], deﬁning the solutions for the location LA
i
and time offset δA
i . As the quadratic equation has at most two solu-
tions [1], and each of the linear equations has one unique solution,
there are at most two solutions for the attacker’s position and trans-
mission time.
This result can also be observed in our example by adding a
fourth victim placed at P4 = (10, 0, 0), which is spoofed to L(cid:48)
4 =
(−1, 0, 0) with δ(cid:48)
4 = 0. The possible placements for the attacker’s
antenna is now the intersection of the previously obtained curve
with another hyperboloid, yielding two points only (Figure 5(c)).

One way to show this result is to use an afﬁne transformation to
describe the relation between physical and spoofed locations of the
receivers and senders. If the formation of the victims is preserved,
there exists a bijective afﬁne augmented transformation matrix T
which describes this translation and rotation. Assuming that L and

The results in Table 2 show that there are no restrictions on the

constant formation, the attacker is getting more and more restricted
in terms of his antenna placement. For civilian GPS, the attacker
has more degrees of freedom because he can select claimed (false)

tion of hyperboloids, etc., whereas these are ﬁxed for military GPS
(i. e., there is only one speciﬁc hyperboloid of attacker positions for
each transmitted signal per pair of victims).
5. EXPERIMENTS ON SATELLITE-LOCK
TAKEOVER
A GPS spooﬁng attack in the presence of legitimate GPS satellite
signals requires the attacker to make the victim stop receiving sig-
nals from the legitimate satellites and start receiving the attacker’s
Figure 6: The experimental setup.
signals. If this takeover is noticed by the victim, e. g. because the
victim suddenly loses contact to previously seen satellites, it can
detect the spooﬁng attack. While the victim might lose contact
due to random noise or environmental changes, the attacker ideally
should take over without being noticed. We say that the receiver
has a lock on a speciﬁc transmitter when it is already receiving data
from that satellite. The satellite lock makes spooﬁng attacks harder
since a spooﬁng signal is likely to be misaligned (in phase, Doppler
shift, or data content) to the legitimate signal. When the attacker’s
signal is turned on, this momentary interruption in the data-ﬂow
from that satellite could cause the victim to be temporarily unable
to compute his position. Therefore, we now investigate how the
attacker can take over the victim’s lock with the victim losing the
ability to calculate its position, even for a moment.
In Section 3 we assumed a strong attacker, who is always able to
generate signals with perfect timing and power level, and who has
perfect knowledge of his own and the victim’s position. In a practi-
cal attack, many of these assumptions might be invalid. We conduct
experiments to evaluate the inﬂuence of such imperfections. Be-
cause we do not change the claimed location of the satellite in the
data sent by the attacker, all discussed imperfections should apply
equally for military and public GPS receivers.
5.1 Experimental Setup and Procedure
In our experiments, the spooﬁng signals and the legitimate GPS
signals are sent over a cable to eliminate the inﬂuence of the trans-
mission channel. This enables us to measure the unique inﬂuence
of the parameters of interest while disregarding channel and an-
tenna noise.
We conduct the lock takeover attacks using a Spirent GSS7700
GPS simulator (see Figure 6). The GPS signal simulator is a hard-
ware device that generates GPS signals and is controlled by a dedi-
cated simulation PC running the SimGen simulation software pack-
age [20]. The GSS7700 GPS simulator generates two independent
GPS constellations with up to 16 satellites in each. One constel-
lation is simulating the signals from the legitimate GPS satellites,
and the other is simulating the attacker’s signals. Both are mixed
together and sent to the GPS receiver via a wired connection. The
GPS receiver in our experiments is an Antaris evaluation kit by u-
blox, containing the ATR0600 GPS chip from Atmel.
At the start of each experiment, we send only the legitimate GPS
signals for a static location. We reset the GPS receiver to make sure
all experiments are independent and no internal state is kept from
a previous experiment. After about 30 seconds the GPS receiver
will lock on to enough satellites to be able to calculate a stable
position. This position is the legitimate position L and the goal of
the attacker is now to move the victim to a new location L(cid:48) such
that (i) the victim is continuously able to compute its position (ii)
no noticeable discontinuities in the location occur.

The attack then consists of two phases: ﬁrst, the attacker sends
signals which are supposed to match the legitimate satellites’ sig-
nals at the location of the victim. These are generated by the at-
tacker by approximating the current location of the victim as Linit,
and constructing signals with time delays and data content appro-
priate for that location (see Section 4.1). This ﬁrst phase lasts for
one minute to allow the victim to lock on to the new signals. In
the second phase, the attacker start to move the spoofed location
towards the ﬁnal location L(cid:48), imitating an acceleration of 0.5m/s2.
After 3 minutes, the ﬁnal location is reached. If this ﬁnal location
is not remotely close to L(cid:48) (height difference ≤150m, horizontal
distance ≤1km), we consider the takeover failed.
We vary the distance between the victim’s true location L and
its initial location as assumed by the attacker Linit as one of the
parameters in the experiments. We refer to this distance as the lo-
cation offset dinit = |L− Linit|. The other parameters we investi-
gate are relative signal power, relative time offset and constant time
offset. For each parameter value, ﬁve experiments were run.
We say that the lock takeover was successful if at the end of the
experiment the victim’s ﬁnal location is close to L(cid:48). If the victim
is close to L(cid:48) but was unable to compute a valid position for more
than one second during the lock takeover, we consider the attack a
partial success and use the number of seconds the victim was not
able to calculate a valid position as an error metric.
5.2 Results of the Experiments
Relative signal power of the spooﬁng signal: In this experiment,
ideal spooﬁng signals are sent, but the power of the spooﬁng sig-
nals is varied between −2dB and +8dB relative to the legitimate
signals. Figure 7(a) shows the effect of using spooﬁng signals that
have the same power as the legitimate signals. In this ﬁgure, ts
marks the time at which the spooﬁng signals are turned on and tm
the time when the spoofed location starts to move away from Linit.
The errors in longitude, latitude, and height are shown separately
and are measured between the location as reported by the receiver
and the one sent by the simulator. Although the victim reports the
spoofed location for some time, it switches back to L after 170s of
the experiment, which causes the growing error in longitude.
Figure 7(b) shows the error in meters between the position re-
ported by the GPS receiver and the location sent by the attacker, as
a function of the relative power of the attacker’s signals. The error
bars show the standard deviation for the error value over the ﬁve
experimental runs. The gray bars indicate the ratio of experiments
in which the receiver was unable to determine its position during
the experiment. We use this as a metric to evaluate the smoothness
of the lock takeover. If the receiver reported a location too far away
from L(cid:48), we count this run as failed takeover. Blue bars in the ﬁgure
denote the ratio of attempts in which the GPS receiver was unable
to compute a valid location.
It can be seen that for at least 2dB more power, the receiver con-
sistently locks onto the spooﬁng signals without any offset occur-
ring. 2dB of power is sufﬁciently low to not be detected by power
based spooﬁng-countermeasures in practice.
Constant time offset inﬂuence: The second question we investi-
gate is the effect of a general delay on all signals sent by the attacker
relative to the legitimate signals. Such time delays can occur if the
attacker’s system setup is not perfectly compensating for internal
delays, the distance to the victim is unknown or the system clock
of the attacker is not synchronized perfectly to the clock of the le-
gitimate GPS satellites. The interesting question is if such a general
time offset will result in detectable errors in the victim’s reported
position, and if such a time offset will increase the chance of the
victim losing lock completely during the takeover. To evaluate the
inﬂuence of a constant time offset, we run the tests with time off-

sets between 0ns and 240ns. We plot the location error between
the attacker’s intended location and the actual location reported by
the victim an example run in Figure 7(c). The effects are consistent
over several runs with the same parameters, but can vary quite a lot
with these parameters.
In Figure 7(d), we show the general relation between the average
errors during the measurement as a function of the time offset for
the ﬁrst 120ns. After this time, lock takeover was not working
consistently any more.
Location offset inﬂuence: In this series of experiments we deter-
mine the inﬂuence of an offset dinit between the position of the
victim as determined from the legitimate satellites L and the spoof-
ing signals sent by the attacker Linit. We evaluate the inﬂuence of
such a location offset for values between 0 and 450m. Similarly
to the time offset, this location offset can lead to a relatively large
error during the lock takeover. An example with offset of 340m is
given in Figure 8(a).
In Figure 8(b), we show the average error as a function of the lo-
cation offset. Regardless of the intermediate errors, eventually the
victim always synchronizes to the attacker’s signals in all our ex-
periments. This shows that the initial position is not very sensitive
to small errors. If an attacker knows the location of his victim to
within about 100 meters, he can perform a smooth takeover without
the victim losing lock. There will of course be a detectable jump in
position from L to Linit when the attackers signal is turned on but
the victim will not lose lock with any satellite.
Relative time offset inﬂuence: In the case where the attacker has
access to more than one transmission antenna, he can send the
spooﬁng signals using two or more omnidirectional antennas (see
Section 4). Depending on the relative position of the individual an-
