Figure 5. An estimate of bandwidth usage in two sampled botnets. Just examining the maximum
bandwidth, the botnets appear to have roughly the same distribution of high, medium and low-speed
bots, and therefore appear to pose the same DDoS threat potential. The analysis below, however,
shows how diurnal changes signiﬁcantly reduce the average available bandwidth of (b), compared
to (a).

more metrics, and not only measure the robustness, but also
the effectiveness and efﬁciency of a botnet for the botmas-
ter.
Researchers have attempted to study the botnet problem
in a systematic way. Barford and Yegneswaran [8] codify
the capabilities of malware by dissecting four widely-used
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) botnet codebases. Each code-
base is classiﬁed along seven dimensions including bot-
net control mechanisms, host control mechanisms, propa-
gation mechanisms, exploits, delivery mechanisms, obfus-
cation and deception mechanisms. Trend Micro [35] also
proposed a taxonomy of botnet threats, along dimensions
such as attacking behavior, command and control model,
rally mechanism, communication protocol, evasion tech-
nique, and other observable activities. Our taxonomy is dif-
ferent from this existing work. It is a use-driven taxonomy
focused on the botnet structure. We study the problem from
speciﬁc aspects such as the structure and the utility metrics
of the botnets.

Our taxonomy and discussion of general response op-
tions presumes a sensitive detection system. We have not
considered detection of botnets, and urge further research.
We note preliminary detection work in misuse systems [22],
and IRC traces [11]. Signiﬁcantly, this early work focuses
on tracking individual bots (e.g., to obtain a binary) and not
the network cloud of coordinated attackers addressed in our
study. In [13,17], researchers focused on countering botnets
(as opposed to individual bots), which used honeypots and
broad sensors to track and inﬁltrate botnets. Recently, there
are several works on the botnet detection problem. BotH-
unter [20] is a bot detection system using IDS-Driven Di-
alog Correlation according to deﬁned bot infection dialog
model. Rishi [18] uses the similarity of nick name to detect
botnet channel. Karasaridis, et al. [28], proposed to detect
botnet command and control through passive network ﬂow
record analysis.
5 Conclusion
Botnets present signiﬁcant new challenges for
re-
searchers. The ﬂuid nature of this problem requires re-
searchers anticipate future botnet strategies and design ef-
fective response techniques. To assist in this effort, we pro-
posed key metrics to measure botnet utility for various ac-
tivities, and presented a taxonomy of botnets based on topo-
logical structure.
Our analysis shows that random network models (either
direct Erd¨os-R´enyi models or structured P2P systems) give
botnets considerable resilience. Such formations resist both
random and targeted responses. Our analysis also showed
that targeted removals on scale free botnets offer the best
response.
We have demonstrated the utility of this taxonomy and
proposed metrics by using both simulation and real-world
botnet experiments. We also performed some novel mea-
surements of a P2P botnet to demonstrate the utility of our
proposed metrics.
In our future work, we will reﬁne our metrics of botnet
utilities, explore effective techniques for more accurate esti-
mations of these metrics in real-world botnets. We will also
identify metrics that measure difﬁculties in detection, and
the evasive potential of botnets.
