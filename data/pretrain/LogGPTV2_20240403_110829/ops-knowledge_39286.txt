User: I am using rabbitmq as broker, there is a strange behaviour that is happening in my production environment only. Randomly sometimes my celery stops consuming messages from a queue, while it consumes from other queues.
This leads to pileup on messages in queue, if i restart my celeryd everything starts to work fine. 
"/var/logs/celeryd/worker" does not indicate any error. I am not even sure where to start looking as i am new to python/django.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Assistant: I found the problem in my code,
So in one of my task i was opening a connection to parse using urllib3 that was getting hung.
After moving out that portion in async task, things are working fine now.
