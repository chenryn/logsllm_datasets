I am using RabbitMQ as the message broker in my application. I have encountered a peculiar issue that only occurs in the production environment. Occasionally, Celery stops consuming messages from a specific queue while it continues to process messages from other queues. This results in a backlog of messages in the affected queue. Restarting the Celery worker (`celeryd`) resolves the issue temporarily.

The log file located at `/var/logs/celeryd/worker` does not indicate any errors. As I am relatively new to Python and Django, I am unsure where to begin troubleshooting this problem. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

**Update:**

I have identified the root cause of the issue. In one of my tasks, I was opening a connection to parse data using `urllib3`, which was causing the task to hang. After refactoring that portion of the code into an asynchronous task, the system is now functioning correctly.
