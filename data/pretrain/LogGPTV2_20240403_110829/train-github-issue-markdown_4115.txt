Example below. While we don't support ops between different dtype tensors, we
should consider changing this behavior. In numpy, this would return a floating
tensor.
    >>> import torch
    >>> a = torch.tensor([1,2,3], dtype=torch.long)
    >>> b = torch.tensor([3,2,1], dtype=torch.long)
    >>> a/b
     0
     1
     3
    [torch.LongTensor of size (3,)]
