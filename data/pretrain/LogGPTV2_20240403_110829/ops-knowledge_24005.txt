### Situation Overview

At my current job, I am required to use a third-party website to access HR-related information, such as paychecks, vacation hours, and other personal data. However, I have several concerns about the security of this website.

### Security Concerns

1. **Lack of Brute-Force Protection:**
   - I noticed that I could repeatedly enter incorrect passwords without being locked out. This suggests that the website does not have adequate brute-force protection, making it vulnerable to automated password guessing attacks.

2. **Insecure Security Questions:**
   - After logging in, I was required to set up three security questions from a list of eight pre-determined options. Many of these questions (e.g., first car's license plate, spouse's second name, second name of my first child) are either irrelevant to me or easily discoverable through social media. Additionally, the limited number of options makes it easier for an attacker to guess the correct answers.
   
3. **Outdated Software:**
   - Upon inspecting the website using developer tools, I found that it uses an outdated JavaScript implementation of the MD5 hashing algorithm, which is known to be insecure. The version in use (2.1, Copyright 1999-2002) is particularly concerning.

### Actions Taken

I reported these concerns to my superiors, but they did not seem particularly interested in addressing them.

### Next Steps

**A. Verifying the Security of the Website:**

To determine if the website is as insecure as I suspect, I can take the following steps:

1. **Conduct a Basic Security Audit:**
   - Use online tools to check for common vulnerabilities, such as those provided by services like Qualys SSL Labs or Sucuri SiteCheck.
   - Review the website's security headers and configurations using tools like Security Headers or Mozilla Observatory.

2. **Consult a Security Expert:**
   - If possible, consult with a cybersecurity professional who can perform a more thorough assessment of the website's security posture.

**B. Communicating the Concerns to the Company:**

If the website is indeed insecure, I need to communicate this to the company in an appropriate and effective manner. Here are some steps I can take:

1. **Document the Findings:**
   - Compile a detailed report outlining the security issues, including the lack of brute-force protection, insecure security questions, and outdated software. Provide evidence and references to support the claims.

2. **Raise the Issue with HR/Payroll:**
   - Schedule a meeting with the HR or Payroll department to discuss the security concerns. Present the documented findings and explain the potential risks to the company and its employees.

3. **Contact the Data Protection Officer (DPO):**
   - If the company is based in Europe, I can also reach out to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) to highlight the security issues. Emphasize that the "Data Processor" (the third-party website) has troubling account security practices that need to be investigated.

4. **Anonymous Reporting:**
   - If I prefer to remain anonymous, I can use an internal whistleblower system or an external reporting mechanism, such as a secure email or a dedicated hotline. Ensure that the report is clear, concise, and includes all relevant details.

### Conclusion

While I cannot control the security practices of the third-party website, I can take proactive steps to verify the security issues and communicate them effectively to the company. By doing so, I can help ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect the sensitive information of myself and my colleagues.
