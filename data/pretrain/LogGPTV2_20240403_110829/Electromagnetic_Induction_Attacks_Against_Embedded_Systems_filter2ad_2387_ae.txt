While the sharp voltage drops of VA(t) result in voltage decreases
of Vatk(t) at the receiver, the slow increases of the sawtooth have
a negligible effect. We note that a square wave could also be used.
Additionally, we observed that reversing the sawtooth waveform
(i.e., slow decrease in voltage and then a very steep increase) results
in voltage increase at the target. This could be used to increase the
duration of PWM signals, which would result in the rotation of the
servo in the opposite direction (counter clockwise in our case).
5.2 Experimental Setup
The target circuitry is composed of three components: a DC supply,
a Tiva C microcontroller, and a Futaba S3152 digital servo. The
Tiva C microcontroller is used to generate a PWM signal with 2 ms
duration at 50 Hz, which produced a consistent rotation angle for
the servo (as in Fig. 9). The attack setup employed a toroid with a
Mix 61 composition, giving a relative permeability of 125, with an
air-gap to enable attacks without any physical contact.
In empirically validating (12), we observed that a 10 Vpp saw-
tooth waveform resulted in a voltage drop of 200 mV. However, a
voltage drop of 2.2 V for 5 µs is necessary for servo rotation manip-
ulation, which means a higher power transmitter is required. To
this end, a Nobsound TPA3116 amplifier, a 4 Ohm power resistor
Figure 9: PWM with 2 ms and the servo position (red), PWM
with 1.5 ms and the servo position (yellow),voltage drop
added PWM and the servo position (blue)
To determine the minimum voltage drop, and the be duration of
the drop, necessary to cause the servo to misinterpret the duration
of the signal, the amplitude and duration of the attack signal were
varied. It was observed that a 2.2 V voltage drop for approximately
5 µs are the minimum values for manipulating the servo. That is,
an attacker able to induce a waveform at the victim circuitry that
creates at least a 2.2 V voltage drop for 5 µs will cause the perceived
PWM duration to be decreased and hence cause the servo to rotate
in one direction (clock-wise in our case (Fig. 9).
tacker waveform, VA(t) =∫
It is assumed that the exact frequency (50 Hz for our servo) and
phase of the target PWM are known. However, even if the frequency
and the phase of the target are unknown, it is possible for an attacker
to move the servo in one direction, although in an uncontrolled
manner, as the attacker signal would sweep the legitimate PWM
signal and randomly reduce the duration of the legitimate signal.
An analytical approach was used to determine an efficient at-
Vatk(t)dt, to produce a voltage drop
at the target receiver. A coupling model based on a wire-wrapped
toroid with the targeted PWM signal wire coiled through it were
assumed. The attacker voltage VA(t) is applied to the toroid and
the voltage induced Vatk(t) was found on the target coil. A magne-
toquasistatic (MQS) and lumped circuit model were used. The MQS
approach is explained in Section 2 and is applicable here because
of the small size of the overall system in terms of the attack signal
wavelength (≈ 6 km) [21, 42].
The relationship between IA(t), the current flowing through the
wire wrapped around the toroid, and Vatk(t) is

and µf is the permeability of the toroid, N is the number of coils

An expression for IA(t) in terms of VA(t) was derived using an
RL circuit model, as shown in Fig. 1c, for the toroid. Ratk is taken

provides a step-up in the attacker’s voltage, which allows for a greater change in current (and hence greater induced voltage
at the target circuitry)
Rp, a 1-to-6 step up transformer (built using another toroid) and a
70 coil air-gapped toroid were connected in series (Fig. 10c). The
relatively wideband operation of the audio amplifier enables the
amplification of sawtooth waveforms, while the power resistor is
used for adjusting the time duration of the voltage drop (according
to (11)). Additionally, the resistor was used for impedance matching
between the amplifier and toroid, so as to keep the amplifier in
stable operation. The step-up transformer was used to increase
the voltage drop at the victim by increasing the voltage across the
dt IA(t) (i.e., the energy stored in the inductor
toroid and hence d
increased the attack effect). The output of the step-up transformer
was connected to the air gapped attacker toroid.
5.3 Experimental Results and Discussion
One coil of the PWM cable that transfers the PWM signal to servo
engine was wound around the toroid4. Fig. 11 shows the measure-
ment setup for the false actuation injection attack. The attack signal
fed to the audio amplifier was a 5 Vpp sawtooth waveform at 50 Hz.
This signal resulted in a voltage drop of 2.3 V, as measured at the
input to the servo (Fig. 12b). As this voltage drop caused the sig-
nal observed by the servo engine to exceed the thresholds for a
legitimate downward transition (edge), the apparent PWM dura-
tion was decreased to 1.5 ms. This resulted in a clockwise rotation
of the servo by 45° (Fig. 12b). To hold the servo at this angle, the
frequency of VA(t) was locked to that of the legitimate PWM sig-
nal and the phase of VA(t) adjusted to the desired high duration
(1.5 ms). Changing the phase of the attacker signal resulted in the
servo stabilizing at other rotation angles as well (in the clockwise
direction, as expected). In a subsequent experiment, the frequency
of VA(t) was changed to 60 Hz while leaving the PWM signal at
50 Hz. In this instance the servo would change positions randomly.
The proposed attack is capable of rotating a servo, however, there
are some limitations. First of all, the attack is based on decreasing
the PWM duration, thus rotation is limited to one direction. Sec-
ondly, the attacker was placed in close proximity of the target. We
believe that the attack can be extended to address both of these
limitations by increasing the transmission power (or directing the
4It is unnecessary to coil the PWM signal wire around the toroid to achieve an effect;
the same effect was observed when a length of the wire was placed within a solenoid.
As the H field strength drops off sharply outside of both of these structures, this implies
that producing an effect at a distance requires the proper selection of a field directivity
element, e.g., an extremely/super/ultra low-frequency antenna [37]

tion attack
transmitted energy more effectively) and extending the pulse dura-
tion. In future work, we plan to employ high directivity antennas
and higher frequency signals to increase the attack distance.
6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Our work shows that inductive coupling is an effective way of
injecting both false data and false actuation signals in embedded
systems. Experiments demonstrated that a successful attack could
occur when the attack system was placed beyond 0.5 m.
Opportunities for future work include remotely: (1) determin-
ing the resonant frequency of a sensing/actuator circuit, (2) the
timing/state properties of GPIO signals (i.e., bit duration and bit
being transmitted); and (3) the width and phase of PWM signals.
To address the first of these challenges we will explore the use of
specialized oscillators, known as grid dip oscillators, whose ampli-
tudes change when tuned to the resonant frequency of a nearby
circuit due to Lenz’s law. We will also investigate optimal attack
signals (i.e., the non-sinusoidal signals, likely of high bandwidth,
necessary to induce maximum DC voltages on circuits) in the con-
text of bandwidth constraints of currently available amplifiers. To
increase the range of the attacks we will develop broadband, near-
field antennas (e.g., a Vivaldi antenna filled with high-permittivity
dielectric materials to increase directivity) and experiment with
multiple resonators at defender transmitters to enable high-Q reso-
nant coupling [8].
