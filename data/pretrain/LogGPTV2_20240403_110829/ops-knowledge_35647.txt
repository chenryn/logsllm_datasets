User: So of course I'm new to Python and to programming in general...
I am trying to get OS version information from the network. For now I only care about the windows machines.
using PyWin32 I can get some basic information, but it's not very reliable. This is an example of what I am doing right now: win32net.NetWkstaGetInfo(myip, 100)
However, it appears as though this would provide me with more appropriate information: platform.win32_ver()
I have no idea how get the info from a remote machine using this. I need to specify an IP or a range of IP's... I intend on using Google's ipaddr to get a list of network ranges to scan. I will eventually need to scan a large network for this info.
Can someone provide an example?
Assistant: I had to use remote registry...
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
ProductName, EditionID, CurrentVersion, CurrentBuild
