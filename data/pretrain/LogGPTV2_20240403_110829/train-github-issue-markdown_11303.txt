We use Datanucleus (Version 3.0.1) for our persistence layer. Datanucleus, in
turn, needs the JDO-API Version 3.0.0.  
Now, to be able to use the newest version of JDO/Datanucleus in Spring, I need
to patch the "Import-Package" derective in the manifest  
of the orm library on every update to correct the version range from [2.0.0,
3.0.0) to [2.0.0, 3.1.0):
== Original ==  
Import-Package:  
...  
javax.jdo;version="[2.0.0,
3.0.0)";resolution:="optional",javax.jdo.datastore;version="[2.0.0, 3.0.0)"  
...
== Patched ==  
Import-Package:  
...  
javax.jdo;version="[2.0.0,
3.1.0)";resolution:="optional",javax.jdo.datastore;version="[2.0.0, 3.1.0)"  
...
If I won't do so, resolution could not be done by the OSGi runtime. A fix
would be cool, it would prevent me  
to provide a patched version of the orm library.
Regards,  
Roland
