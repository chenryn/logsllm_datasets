**Roland Hauser** opened **SPR-8693** and commented:

We are using Datanucleus (Version 3.0.1) for our persistence layer, which in turn requires JDO-API Version 3.0.0. To utilize the latest version of JDO/Datanucleus in Spring, I need to modify the "Import-Package" directive in the manifest of the ORM library after each update. Specifically, I need to adjust the version range from [2.0.0, 3.0.0) to [2.0.0, 3.1.0).

### Original Manifest
```plaintext
Import-Package:
...
javax.jdo;version="[2.0.0, 3.0.0)";resolution:="optional",
javax.jdo.datastore;version="[2.0.0, 3.0.0)"
...
```

### Patched Manifest
```plaintext
Import-Package:
...
javax.jdo;version="[2.0.0, 3.1.0)";resolution:="optional",
javax.jdo.datastore;version="[2.0.0, 3.1.0)"
...
```

If this modification is not made, the OSGi runtime will be unable to resolve the dependencies. A fix in the official release would be greatly appreciated, as it would eliminate the need for me to maintain a patched version of the ORM library.

Best regards,
Roland
