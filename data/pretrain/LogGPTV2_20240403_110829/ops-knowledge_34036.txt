User: How to use Nagios for system monitoring and configure monitoring items?
Assistant: Nagios is an open source network and system monitoring software that helps administrators monitor network devices, servers, and applications to detect and take action on failures in a timely manner. The following are the steps to use Nagios for system monitoring and configuration of monitoring items: 1. Install Nagios: You can download and install Nagios from the Nagios official website. After installation, enter the Nagios installation directory on the command line interface and enter "./configure && make all && sudo make install" to perform initial configuration. 2. Configure Nagios: Nagios needs some configuration, which can be configured by modifying the nagios.cfg file. You need to set the Nagios administrator's email (you can receive monitoring alerts through this email) and set the name of the monitoring object. 3. Configure monitoring objects: In Nagios, you need to configure the hosts, services, and service groups to be monitored. Host and service configuration files can be found under /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/. You can use the Nagios command to check the service status, for example: "sudo /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg". 4. Configure the plug-in: Nagios detects the status of the service based on the plug-in. You can use the official Nagios plug-ins or write your own plug-ins. Nagios supports various plugin types such as NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor) plugins, SNMP plugins, etc. 5. Configure notifications: Nagios can be notified by email, SMS or PagerDuty. Notifiers can be configured in the /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg file. 6. Start and test: After all configurations are complete, Nagios can be started. Enter "sudo /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg" in the command line interface to start Nagios. You can use a browser to access the Nagios server address for monitoring. The above are the steps and configuration methods of using Nagios for system monitoring.
