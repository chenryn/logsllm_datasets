3.1 Service System Evaluation Framework
Related research has proposed several business model conceptualizations. We

define concepts that pertain to both external and internal views of service
systems. We do not explain these conceptualizations in detail, but merely
listconceptsrelevanttoaservicesystemmodel.Itshouldbenotedthatthese
proposalsareunrelatedtotheservicetheoriesreviewedintheprevioussection,
hence, both types of related work will be used in the next section to derive
the most common service system concepts.
3.1.1 Business Model Conceptualizations of Service Systems
Alt and Zimmermann [2] distinguished six generic elements as a comprehen-
sive framework to develop business models: Mission, Structure, Processes,
Revenues,Legal issuesandTechnology.Publishedin2001,thisistheear-
liestproposalinourstudy,butaswecanseebyanalyzingTable3.1italready
mentionsmostofthegenericconceptsthatnewermodelsusedthemost.This
indicates that it had an impact in the field.
Petrovic et al. [32] divided a business model into seven sub-models: Value
model, Resource model, Production model, Customer relations model
(it was further divided into Distribution model, Marketing model and
38 3 The LSS-USDL Model
Service model), Revenue model, Capital model, and Market model. The
naming of this model’s elements hints at a lower level description for each of
them. However, the authors do not identify any further characteristics.
Kaner and Karni [20, 22] proposed CAIOPHYKE, a service model based
on 9 major classes: Customers, Goals, Inputs, Outputs, Processes, Human
enablers, Physical enablers, Information enablers, and Environment.
Each of these major classes can be further described by main classes, which
can then be further described by their respective minor classes. This model
wasdevelopedbasedonastudywith150studentprojectsthatcoveredaround
100servicedomains[21].Thisisoneofthemostcomprehensivemodelsfound
in the literature. However, it features a high level of complexity without a
proper formalization, which prevents from creating an abstraction to handle
complexity.

Value proposition based interactions,Governance mechanism based-
interactions, Stakeholders, Measures, Resources, Access rights and
Questions [36]. Table 3.1 shows that it is one of the most complete mod-
els of our study.

Fielt[14]extendedtheBusinessModelCanvasbyaddressingitsstrongest
limitations:thelackofpartnering(c.f.[15])andco-creation(c.f.[13])concepts.
Thisincreasedthecomplexityoftheoriginalmodel.However,Table3.1shows
that this new model only contributes to one more element of the common
concepts, so there is a risk that this increase in complexity might not be
beneficial.
Zolnowski et al. [41] tried to tackle the issue of lack of elements of the
original Business Model Canvas to describe co-creation. This proposed ap-
proachfocusesonaredistributionoftheelementsandtheirconnections,rather
than changing them as seen in Fielt’s approach. Hence, this model shares the
same concepts as the original Business Model Canvas, but their organization
changes (p.158 [41]).

is possible to identify common concepts for describing service systems and,
thus, derive a service evaluation framework of the most frequent and relevant
concepts.ThemostcommonconceptsidentifiedaretheGoals,Stakeholders,
Processes, Inputs, Outputs, Resources, Measures, Legal and Financial

Goals are one of the most used concepts in the studied models. There is
nodoubtthatthisisacriticalelementforaservicemodel,notonlybecauseof
its wide acceptance among the studied approaches, but also because it states
the objectives of the service system and its value proposition to consumers.
Stakeholdersareoneofthemostimportantconceptsofaservice,sinceit
is conditioned by the people and organizations involved. This concept is used
by almost all the studied approaches due to its importance. In most service
models, there is an attribute for service customers. In the Business Model
CanvasfromOsterwalder[31]andthetwostudiedimprovedapproachesthere
is also an attribute for service partners [14, 31, 41]. Spohrer and Maglio [36]
propose additional attributes which specialize stakeholders into authorities
and competitors.
Processes are, along with Goals, a concept that all studied approaches
share. This concept is of utmost importance when describing services from
an internal organization, because corporations must have a strong knowledge
40 3 The LSS-USDL Model
of the processes needed for their services, to identify bottlenecks, and other
issues.
Inputs are described in a small set of service models. Spohrer and
Maglio [36] refer to them using the concept of Ecology. Fielt [14], when ex-
tendingtheBusinessModelCanvas,addsPartner activitiesandCustomer
activities, which act as an input for the service. Karni and Kaner’s CAIO-
PHYKE model [22] features the major class Inputs.
Outputs are also described in a small set of service models. Spohrer and
Maglio[36]refertothemusingtheconceptof Outcomes.e3service[24]features
outputsintheclassesConsequence,Benefit,andValue derivation.Karni
and Kaner [22] feature the major class Outputs.
Resources are described in most service description models, being absent
just in e3service. Alt and Zimmermann’s approach [2] is the only model that
does a partial description of this concept, focusing only on technology.
Measures refer to how the company can know its services’ performance
receive feedback of their operations. Only a small number of models were
found in the literature that addressed this concept, as shown in Table 3.1.
Legal is the concept for the legal aspects of a service or business. It has
a surprisingly low presence in the literature. Exceptions are Alt and Zimmer-
mann [2] who propose Legal issues as one of their six generic elements of a
business model; Karni and Kaner [22] use the main class Legal factors in
the major class Environment; and Spohrer and Maglio identify Governance
mechanism based interactions and Access rights [36].
Financial is the concept for the financial aspects of a service. This con-
cept is used in most of the studied approaches. Hence, it is also an important
concept for developing a comprehensive service model and evaluation frame-
work.
3.2 Concepts and Building Blocks
The central concept of the service system model we propose is the notion of
co-creation (which we will later call an interaction point). This concept shifts
our study of economic activity from a Goods-Dominant logic (GD) where
valueexchangeisperceivedthroughgoodstransactionstoaService-Dominant
logic(SD)wherevalueexchangeisco-createdbyallpartiesofserviceinterac-
tions[26].Therefore,wenolongerseevalueexchangeasaproviderdelivering
value to a customer by selling a product, but rather as both provider and
customer co-creating value to each other during service interactions. Since
co-creationduringserviceinteractionsisacorefeatureofservicesystemsand
the interactions flow is also a core feature in service blueprints [34], we can
conclude that a service system should be represented by its flow of interac-
tions and their contextual information, such as the co-created value. Hence,
we focus on describing service interactions, their context, and their flow.
3.3 Model Structure 41
The central concept of co-creation is complemented with a classification
according to the interrogative pronouns commonly used in journalism: what,
how, where, who, when, and why. It allows di↵erent people to look at the
same service system from distinct perspectives by providing a holistic view
on a system. The use of these pronouns has shown to be comprehensive for
event-centered reporting [3]. This indicates that they may also be relevant to
describe the events that are an integral elements of a service system. This
strategyhasshowntoworkwellwiththeZachman’sframeworkforenterprise
architecture [40] and other approaches by di↵erent authors in the field of
information systems [8, 12, 35]. This classification enhances readability and
understandability, gives an intuitive meaning to abstract concepts and helps
organizations to ask questions about their processes and process models [35].
Italsohelpsidentifyingsomecharacteristicsofaserviceo↵erandcanbeused
as a common framework for querying di↵erent services [12].
Finally, the notion of co-creation and the interrogative pronouns are en-
riched with the concepts identified using the service model evaluation frame-
workintheprevioussection.Theframeworkcombinestheknowledgegathered
bydi↵erentauthorsinordertoprovideasetofconceptscommonlyusedforthe

monytokeepthefinalmodelsimple.Ourpreviousexperiencewhiledeveloping
the third version of USDL [4] showed us that a model which tries to capture
all the details of a domain becomes expensive, large, and more complex than
necessary which harms its adoption and understanding.
3.3 Model Structure
ThecentralelementofthemodelisanInteraction.Bymatchingtheframe-
work ofcommon conceptsdiscussed inthe previoussection withthe interrog-
ative pronouns, we obtain theconcept Stakeholdersfor the pronoun “who”,
the concept Goals for the pronoun “why”, the concept Resource for the
pronoun“what”,andtheconceptProcessforthepronoun“how”.Theinter-
rogative pronouns “when” and “where” are easily matched with the spatial
and temporal context, respectively, of a service interaction. Furthermore, for
a service system analysis, we can study the stakeholders’ participation based
on the actual roles that take part of an interaction. In addition, the flow of
di↵erent resources can also be matched with the concepts Input and Output.
Hence,wecandescribeserviceinteractionswiththesixinterrogativepronouns

introduced by the U.S. Navy in 1960.
42 3 The LSS-USDL Model
• Who: Role (stakeholder; human or computer actor)
• Why: Goal (a service interaction goal)
• What: Resource (may be physical, knowledge or financial)
• How: Process (the business process a service interaction belongs to)
• When: Time (expresses temporal dependencies)
• Where: Location (the locations where service interactions occur)
The resulting structure is called a 6-point interaction star model for de-
scribing service interactions, as shown in Fig. 3.1.
Fig. 3.1. 6-point interaction star model
Moreover, inspired by the work on service blueprinting [16], we may also
classify interactions based on their area of action. A blueprint is a method
created by Shostack [34] for analyzing a service delivery process by using a
flow chart-like presentation to distinguish several types of customer interac-
tions [25]. Thus, an interaction can be classified as a customer interaction, an
onstage interaction, a backstage interaction, or a support interaction.
The foundational ontology DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic
and Cognitive Engineering) [28] classifies resources as endurants if they are
physical objects or perdurants if they are not physical, such as services or
events. Poels [33] classifies resources as operand if they are passive resources
like objects or operant if they are knowledge and skills that embody com-
petences. We can also find this pattern in some of the models we studied in
the previous chapter. Therefore, resources should be classified as physical or
knowledge.Wealsoconsiderathirdclassification,financialresources,because
of its importance for a business-oriented model.
Fig. 3.2 shows these extensions to the interaction and resource entities.

TheimplementationofthemodelwascalledLinkedServiceSystemforUSDL
(LSS-USDL) and it was guided by two main objectives: 1) to use semantic
web technologies to make the model computer-understandable and sharable,
and 2) to enable the model to refer to data from the Linked Data Cloud
(LDC) [17].
By bridging LSS-USDL and the LDC, service systems can be semanti-
cally enriched by establishing meaningful relationships with data present in
the LDC, which includes information such as company names, locations, and
traded resources stored in semantic data sources such as DBpedia (dbpedia.
org), GeoNames (geonames.org), and WordNet (wordnet.princeton.edu).
3.4.1 The Semantic Web
TheWorldWideWebConsortium(W3C)startedtoworkontheconceptofa
Semantic Web with the objective of developing solutions for data integration
and interoperability. The goal was to develop ways to allow computers to in-
terpret(sometimestermedunderstand)informationintheweb.TheSemantic
Webidentifiesasetoftechnologiesandstandardsthatformthebasicbuilding
blocks of an infrastructure that supports the vision of the meaningful web.
LSS-USDL is a service system description schema that was formalized us-
ingtwotechnologiesfromtheSemanticWeb:theResourceDescriptionFrame-
work (RDF) [27] and RDF Schema (RDFS) [10]. RDFS was used to define
a schema and vocabulary to describe services. This schema is used to cre-
ate RDF graphs that describe individual services. Both, RDF and RDFS, are
used by applications that need to interpret and reason about the meaning
of information instead of just parsing data for display purposes. This section
willprovideanoverviewofthemainframeworks,languages,technologies,and
knowledge bases behind the Semantic Web, namely, RDF, RDFS, Turtle no-
tation, SPARQL, and Linked Data. Nonetheless, it does not aim to provide a
comprehensivedescriptionofthesetechnologies.Thus,thereaderisalsorefer-

3.4.2 RDF
The resource description framework was developed by the W3C to provide
a common way to describe information so it could be read and interpreted
by computer applications. It was initially designed using XML (eXtensible
Markup Language [9]) as the underlying syntax, which enables syntactic in-
teroperability. RDF provides a graph model for describing resources on the
