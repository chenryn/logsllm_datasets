Question: A software development team is reviewing their project's codebase and discovers multiple instances where global variables are heavily used to maintain state across various components. What are the potential disadvantages of continuing with this approach?
"A": "It can lead to tighter coupling between components, making the codebase harder to maintain and understand.",
"B": "Global variables may increase the application's performance by reducing the overhead of parameter passing.",
"C": "Excessive reliance on global variables can result in unexpected side effects and make debugging more difficult.",
"D": "Global variables simplify the management of application state, especially in large, complex systems."
Answer: AC
