I have installed Cuckoo Sandbox in an Ubuntu environment, with Windows 7 32-bit as the guest OS. I followed the instructions provided on the Cuckoo Sandbox website, and my virtual machine is named `windows_7`. I also updated the "machine" and "label" fields correctly in the `virtualbox.conf` file.

However, when I attempt to start Cuckoo by executing `sudo python cuckoo.py`, I encounter the following error:
```
WARNING: Configuration details about machine windows_7 are missing: Option windows_7 is not found in configuration, error: Config instance has no attribute 'windows_7'
CRITICAL: CuckooCriticalError: No machines available.
```

To resolve this issue, I modified the `virtualbox.conf` configuration file. The default configuration in this file is set for a virtual machine titled `[cuckoo1]`. Since my virtual machine is named `windows_7`, I changed `[cuckoo1]` to `windows_7` in the configuration file. This adjustment ensures that Cuckoo can correctly identify and use the `windows_7` virtual machine, as it was previously unable to find the configuration details due to the mismatch in the virtual machine name.
