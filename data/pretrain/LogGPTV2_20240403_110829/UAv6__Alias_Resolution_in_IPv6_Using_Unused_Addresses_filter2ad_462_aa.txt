## Abstract
As the IPv6 Internet expands, the need for effective alias resolution techniques becomes increasingly important. Traditional IPv4 methods, such as Ally, are not directly applicable to IPv6 due to protocol differences. Recent IPv6-specific techniques have shown promise but often rely on deprecated features like source routing or sequential fragment identifiers, which are supported by only a third of router interfaces. This paper introduces UAv6, a novel alias resolution technique for IPv6 that leverages unused addresses within router interface prefixes.

UAv6 operates in two phases: the "harvest" phase, which identifies potential alias pairs by probing unused addresses and eliciting ICMPv6 Address Unreachable (AU) responses, and the "disambiguation" phase, which determines the true aliases among the candidates. The accuracy of UAv6 is confirmed through the Too-Big Trick (TBT) test and comparison with limited ground truth. We also demonstrate that the classic address-based technique for IPv4 can be adapted to IPv6, and that UAv6, TBT, and the address-based method are complementary in resolving IPv6 aliases.

## 1. Introduction
The exhaustion of IPv4 addresses has driven the steady growth of IPv6 adoption, particularly in recent years. As IPv6 deployment increases, understanding its network topology becomes crucial for researchers and commercial providers. Traceroutes, traditionally used for inferring network topology, do not fully suffice as they do not reveal which interfaces belong to the same router. Alias resolution, the process of grouping interfaces onto their corresponding routers, provides a more accurate picture of the actual network topology.

While numerous alias resolution techniques exist for IPv4, protocol differences prevent their direct application to IPv6. Researchers have developed several IPv6-specific techniques over the past decade. Early methods utilized source routing, which has since been deprecated. The shared counter method, successfully applied in IPv4, was recently adapted to IPv6 through the Too-Big Trick (TBT). However, TBT is not universally supported, and alias resolution in IPv6 remains an open challenge.

This paper presents UAv6, a new alias resolution technique for IPv6. UAv6 consists of two phases: the "harvest" phase, which gathers potential alias pairs by probing unused addresses within router interface prefixes, and the "disambiguation" phase, which determines the true aliases among the candidates. The harvest phase leverages the observation that addresses adjacent to router interface addresses are often unused, and probes these addresses to elicit ICMPv6 AU responses. The disambiguation phase uses both new and established techniques to confirm or disprove the alias pairs.

We validate UAv6's accuracy using the TBT test and comparing results with limited ground truth. Additionally, we show that the classic address-based technique for IPv4 can be effectively applied to IPv6, and that UAv6, TBT, and the address-based method are complementary in resolving IPv6 aliases.

## 2. Related Work
### 2.1 Address-Based Techniques
In IPv4, some routers use the outgoing interfaceâ€™s address as the source address for certain ICMP response types. Pansiot and Grad [13] used this behavior to identify aliases by checking when the source address in a response differs from the probed destination. Despite RFC 4443 [6] stating that IPv6 routers must use the address to which the packet was sent as the source address in ICMPv6 responses, we demonstrate that the address-based approach can still find aliases in IPv6.

### 2.2 Source Routing-Based Techniques
Early IPv6 alias resolution techniques used source routing, which was supported by most IPv6 routers. However, source routing has been deprecated due to security concerns, and support is likely to decline further.

### 2.3 Shared Counter-Based Techniques
Rocketfuel [18] introduced Ally, an IPv4 alias resolution scheme that checks if the "IP-ID" fields on two interfaces are generated from a shared counter. In IPv6, the IP-ID field is not present, but many IPv6 routers use a shared counter for generating fragment IDs. The Too-Big Trick (TBT) [3] exploits this by sending large Echo Request packets to candidate alias pairs and checking for sequential fragment IDs. However, only 32% of IPv6 router interfaces provide fragments from a shared sequential counter [12].

### 2.4 Prefix-Based Techniques
UAv6 does not rely on shared counters, source routing, or different source addresses in ICMPv6 responses. Instead, it leverages the presence of partially used prefixes containing unused addresses adjacent to router interface addresses.

## 3. Unused Addresses in IPv6 Prefixes
Given the vast IPv6 address space, we expect that IPv6 router interface addresses on point-to-point links are assigned from /126 or larger prefixes, leaving some addresses unused. This is similar to the practice of using /30s in IPv4. However, conflicting RFCs (RFC 3627 [16] and RFC 6164 [11]) create uncertainty about the recommended prefix length for point-to-point links.

To investigate this, we analyzed 68,474 router interface addresses extracted from traceroutes sent by the Ark project in July 2014 [4]. Figure 1(a) shows the distribution of the last hex digits of these addresses. Most (59%) addresses end in hex digits "1" or "2", and 82% end in binary digits "01" or "10".

[Figure 1(a): Distribution of Last Hex Digits in Router Interface Addresses]

This distribution suggests that many IPv6 router interface addresses are indeed allocated from /126 or larger prefixes, confirming the presence of unused addresses adjacent to router interface addresses.

## 4. UAv6: Harvest and Disambiguation Phases
### 4.1 Harvest Phase
The harvest phase of UAv6 identifies potential alias pairs by probing unused addresses within router interface prefixes. By sending packets to unused addresses, UAv6 elicits ICMPv6 Address Unreachable (AU) responses. The source address of these responses is assumed to belong to a router directly connected to the prefix, providing a candidate alias pair.

### 4.2 Disambiguation Phase
The disambiguation phase determines which of the candidate aliases are true. UAv6 uses both new and established techniques to construct proofs or disproofs. For example, traceroutes can disprove one of the candidate aliases if one address appears on the path to the other. Shared Path MTU (PMTU) caches can prove an alias pair true if the addresses share PMTU caches, as only aliases share PMTU caches.

## 5. Evaluation
We evaluated UAv6's accuracy by running the TBT test on the alias pairs we found. TBT could be applied to 23.2% of the alias pairs, confirming 99.86% of them. We also compared our findings with limited ground truth from the Internet2 dataset, verifying all the Internet2 aliases we discovered.

Additionally, we demonstrated that the classic IPv4 address-based technique works in IPv6, despite RFC 4443 recommendations. UAv6 finds almost twice as many aliases as the address-based technique within router interface addresses derived from traceroutes sent by the Ark project [4].

## 6. Conclusion
UAv6 is a novel and effective alias resolution technique for IPv6 that leverages unused addresses within router interface prefixes. It operates in two phases: the harvest phase, which gathers potential alias pairs, and the disambiguation phase, which confirms the true aliases. UAv6, TBT, and the address-based method are complementary in resolving IPv6 aliases, providing a robust solution to the open problem of IPv6 alias resolution.
