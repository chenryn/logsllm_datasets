In my webapp I have multiple PPC configured in different context files. The
primary context file is initialized through ContextLoaderListener and others
are imported into the primary context xml file.
In the primary context file, I have a PPC, which is initializing. Then there
are other PPC in context files that are in jars which are initialized through
imports. The PPC in those context files are not being initialized. If I remove
the PPC from the primary context file, then one of the other PPC is being
initialized. From my meddling around the code, it seems like only one PPC
would be initialized per Application context, with or without imported context
xml files.
Currently I am including all the files though the PPC in my primary context
file.
I am wondering if this is a bug or is this how it is supposed to work?
