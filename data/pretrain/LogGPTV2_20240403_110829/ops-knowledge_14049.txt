User: This might be trivial, but I can't identify the reason for not being able to import user-defined python modules into my python environment. I use Ananconda installation of python in cygwin. I have made entries in bash_profile to append module directory path to PYTHONPATH in this format.
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"<dirpath>"
dirpath starts with /cygdrive/c/Users/
I have an __init__.py file available in the module directory to identify it is a python package.
Kindly provide your inputs. Thanks.
Assistant: Python at the startup builds the sys.path using site.py available in the PYTHONHOME directory. I appended to the file, addsitedir(). That worked for me. If there exists a space in the path, use double quotes around the path.
