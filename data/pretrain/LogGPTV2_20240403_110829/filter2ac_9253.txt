**Title: End-to-End Botnet Monitoring with Automated Configuration Extraction and Emulated Network Participation at Botconf 2019**

As the number and sophistication of bots and botnets continue to rise, automation has become essential for gathering threat intelligence and disseminating it to defense systems. Given the rapid changes in botnet nodes and update sources, this information must be captured and distributed as quickly as possible. In this presentation, we will explore an approach to this challenge, where threat intelligence is automatically extracted from bot samples and their associated botnets. This allows for the immediate distribution of this intelligence to security software on endpoints, enabling real-time monitoring and detection of the latest threats.
