Currently, downloaded dependencies seem to be stored with the scheme
`$DENO_DIR/deps/$PROTOCOL/$ORIGIN/$CHECKSUM`. I use neovim and coc-deno, and
when I jump to definition, I’m sent to these cached files. My current problem
is that I don’t get syntax highlighting because for my editor, this works
based off file extension. I could probably fix this problem myself with editor
configuration but it would be nice if DENO added file extensions so that the
cached path was something like
`$DENO_DIR/deps/$PROTOCOL/$ORIGIN/$CHECKSUM.$EXTENSION`.
The big thing I’m thinking about is what the file extension should be. If Deno
only intends to store javascript/typescript files in the cache, then maybe
`.jsx?` or `.tsx?` would suffice? Or maybe Deno could use an algorithm like:
check if the URL path has an extension and use that, otherwise, check if the
response has a Content-Type header and use the related canonical file
extension, otherwise don’t use a file extension.
