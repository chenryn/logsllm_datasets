Currently, Deno stores downloaded dependencies in a directory structure like `$DENO_DIR/deps/$PROTOCOL/$ORIGIN/$CHECKSUM`. I use Neovim with the coc-deno plugin, and when I jump to a definition, it directs me to these cached files. The issue I'm encountering is that I don't get syntax highlighting in my editor, as it relies on file extensions to determine the language.

To address this, it would be helpful if Deno could append file extensions to the cached files, so the path would look something like `$DENO_DIR/deps/$PROTOCOL/$ORIGIN/$CHECKSUM.$EXTENSION`.

The main consideration is determining the appropriate file extension. If Deno is only caching JavaScript and TypeScript files, using `.js` or `.ts` (and possibly `.jsx` or `.tsx` for React components) could be sufficient. Alternatively, Deno could implement an algorithm to determine the file extension:

1. Check if the URL path has an extension and use that.
2. If the URL does not have an extension, check the `Content-Type` header of the response and use the corresponding canonical file extension.
3. If neither the URL nor the `Content-Type` header provides a suitable extension, do not use one.

This approach would ensure that the cached files have meaningful extensions, improving the editing experience in editors that rely on file extensions for syntax highlighting.
