Abstract
Domain parking is a booming business with millions of
dollars in revenues. However, it is also among the least
regulated: parked domains have been routinely found to
connect to illicit online activities even though the roles
they play there have never been clariﬁed. In this paper,
we report the ﬁrst systematic study on this “dark side” of
domain parking based upon a novel inﬁltration analysis
on domains hosted by major parking services. The idea
here is to control the trafﬁc sources (crawlers) of the do-
main parking ecosystem, some of its start nodes (parked
domains) and its end nodes (advertisers and trafﬁc buy-
ers) and then “connect the dots”, delivering our own traf-
ﬁc to our end nodes across our own start nodes with other
monetization entities (parking services, ad networks, etc)
in-between. This provided us a unique observation of the
whole monetization process and over one thousand seed
redirection chains where some ends were under our con-
trol. From those chains, we were able to conﬁrm the
presence of click fraud, trafﬁc spam and trafﬁc stealing.
To further understand the scope and magnitude of this
threat, we extracted a set of salient features from those
seed chains and utilized them to detect illicit activities on
24 million monetization chains we collected from lead-
ing parking services over 5.5 months. This study reveals
the pervasiveness of those illicit monetization activities,
parties responsible for them and the revenues they gener-
ate which approaches 40% of the total revenue for some
parking services. Our ﬁndings point to an urgent need
for a better regulation of domain parking.
Introduction
1
Consider that you are a domain owner, holding a few do-
main names that you do not have a better use of. Then
one thing you could do is to “park” them with a do-
main parking service to earn some extra cash: whenever
web users type in those domain names (probably acci-
dentally) in the browser’s address bar, the parking ser-
vice resolves the domains to advertisement laden pages,
the revenue generated in this way is then split between
the parking service and the domain owner. Such domain
parking monetization is a million-dollar business [29],
offering a unique marketing channel through newly ac-
quired, underdeveloped domains, or those reserved for
future use. However, with a large number of parked do-
mains being monetized through those services ( Sedo
reported to have 4.4M parked domains in 2013 [29] ),
what becomes less clear is the security implications of
such activities, particularly whether they involve any il-
licit operations, a question we attempt to answer.
Dark side of domain parking. Prior research shows
that once malicious domains (e.g., those hosting a Trafﬁc
Distribution System, TDS) have been discovered, they
often end up being parked [17], i.e. temporarily hosted
by some domain parking services. Those domains come
with a large number of backlinks through which they can
still be visited by the victims of the malicious activities
they were once involved in, such as compromised web-
sites. Web trafﬁc from those backlinks is clearly of low
quality but apparently still used by the parking services to
make money [17]. More problematically, a recent study
reveals suspicious redirections performed by some park-
ing services could be related to click spam [10], though
this could not be conﬁrmed. This ﬁnding echoes what we
observed from the redirection chains collected by crawl-
ing parked domains, some of the URLs on the chains
carried URL patterns related to ad click delivery even
though our crawler did not click on any link at all (Sec-
tion 2.3). Also malicious web content has long been
known to propagate through parked domains [14, 20].
With all such suspicions raised, it is still challenging
to determine whether some parking services are indeed
involved in illicit activities, and if so the types of roles
they play there. The problem is that parking services’
monetization decisions and strategies cannot be directly
observed from the outside. Therefore, in the absence of
information about the nature of input trafﬁc to those ser-
vices and the actual ways it has been monetized, all we

have is guesswork. For example, even though we did
observe redirection chains seemingly related to click de-
livery, without knowing a parking service’s interactions
with its ad network, we were still left with little evidence
that what we saw was indeed click fraud. Note that park-
ing services do not need to play conventional tricks, such
as running click bots [21] or using hidden iframes em-
bedded in a compromised page, to generate fraudulent
clicks, and therefore will not be caught by standard ways
in click fraud detection. In the presence of such technical
challenges, little has been done so far to understand the
illicit activities that can happen during the monetization
of parked domains.
Our study.
In this paper, we report the ﬁrst attempt
to explore the dark side of domain parking and uncover
its security implications. This expedition is made pos-
sible by an innovative methodology to inﬁltrate parking
services. More speciﬁcally, we purchased a set of do-
mains and parked them with those services. Those do-
mains, together with our crawler that continuously ex-
plored parked domains, enable us to control some in-
puts to the parking services. On the receiving end, we
launched ad campaigns and made purchases of web traf-
ﬁc through the ad network or the trafﬁc sellers associ-
ated with those parking services. By carefully tuning pa-
rameters to target web audience we controlled, we were
able to connect the dots, receiving the trafﬁc generated
by our crawler going through our parked domains and
onto our campaign websites. This placed us at a unique
vantage point, where we could observe complete mone-
tization chains between the start and the end nodes we
controlled.
By analyzing such monetization chains, we were sur-
prised to ﬁnd that domain parking services, even highly
popular ones such as PS51, shown in Table 1, are indeed
involved in less-than-legitimate activities that should
never happen: our ad campaigns were charged for the
“click” trafﬁc produced by our own crawler that never
clicked and the trafﬁc we purchased turned out to have
nothing to do with the keywords we speciﬁed; also in-
terestingly, we found that for all the visits through our
parked domains and hitting our ads, only some of them
were reported to our domain-owner’s account (i.e. their
revenues shared with us), though all of them were billed
to our ad account.
To further analyze the scope and magnitude of those
problems, which we call click fraud, trafﬁc spam and
trafﬁc stealing respectively, we ﬁngerprinted those con-
ﬁrmed illicit monetization chains with a set of salient fea-
tures called stamps, and utilized them to identify mone-
tization activities on 24M visits to parked domains not

going through our end nodes (i.e. ad/trafﬁc campaign
websites). New ﬁndings reveal that even leading domain
parking services are involved in illegitimate operations.
On the other hand, such operations were present in only
about 5% of the trafﬁc we observed, which indicates that
those services are largely legitimate. Possible motiva-
tions behind their opportunistic attacks could be mon-
etizing less reputable (secondary) domains (e.g., taken-
down malicious domains) that are difﬁcult to proﬁt from
legitimately, or making up for revenue losses. Further-
more, we conducted an economic study to estimate the
revenues of such dark-side activities, which we found to
be signiﬁcant.
Contributions. The contributions of the paper are out-
lined as follows:
• New methodologies. We performed the ﬁrst system-
atic study of illicit activities in parked domain moneti-
zation. This study was made possible by a suite of new
methodologies that allowed us to inﬁltrate domain park-
ing services and collect a set of complete monetization
chains. We further expanded such “seed” chains over a
large number of redirection chains collected from parked
domains over a 5.5-month period, which laid the foun-
dation for understanding the unique features and the im-
pacts of those activities.
• New ﬁndings. Our study brought to light a set of inter-
esting and important ﬁndings never reported before. Not
only did we conﬁrm the presence of illegitimate opera-
tions including click fraud, trafﬁc spam and trafﬁc steal-
ing during the monetization of parked domains, but we
also reveal the pervasiveness of those activities which af-
fect most leading parking service providers and attribute
it to account for up to 40% of their total revenue. Also
interesting is the discovery of unique features of those
illicit activities and their relations with different moneti-
zation strategies and parking service syndicates.
2 Parked Domain Monetization
2.1 Background
Domain parking. As described before, a parked do-
main is a registered domain name whose owner does not
have a better use of it than temporarily running it as an
ad portal to proﬁt from the trafﬁc the domain receives.
To this end, the owner typically chooses to park the do-
main with a domain parking service, an intermediary be-
tween the owner and various monetization options (ex-
plained later). This is done by setting up an account
with the service, and the owner forwards her domain
trafﬁc to the parking service as speciﬁed by its regula-
tions. The most common way for doing this is through
the Domain Name System (DNS), in which the parked
domain’s Name Server (NS) or Canonical Name record
(CNAME) is set to point to that of the parking service.

In this way, the service gains complete control on the
parked domain and any trafﬁc it receives. Alternatively,
the domain owner can choose to log her domain trafﬁc
before redirecting it to the parking service through HTTP
redirections.
Parking services provide a domain owner with a plat-
form to manage her parked domains. For example, some
parking services let the owner set the keywords to be
used for the parked domain monetization. Also, a do-
main owner can monitor their domain earnings through
revenue reports.
Monetization options. A parked domain owner can
proﬁt from her domain trafﬁc through a number of mone-
tization options. The most popular ones are search adver-
tising and direct-navigation trafﬁc monetization, as elab-
orated below:
• Search advertising. In search advertising (aka., spon-
sored search), the advertiser runs a textual ad campaign
with a search ad network and selects a set of target key-
words for displaying her ads. To serve these ads, the
publisher may operate search-related services such as
search engines and toolbars, or use in-text advertising
techniques (i.e. when the mouse hovers on a target word,
the ad is displayed) to identify the right context for ad-
vertising: for example, it shows ads associated with the
target words that are included in the search terms entered
into search engines or the toolbars. Parking services are
one of such publishers who provide textual ads relevant
to the names of parked domains.
Search advertising is made possible through pay-per-
click (PPC) XML feeds as illustrated in Figure 1. A pub-
lisher submits a search query for certain keywords (rele-
vant to the domain names, in the case of parked domains)
and receives relevant ads in the XML format, which also
include the bidding price per ad from the advertisers. The
publisher in turn picks up a set of ads to display. Once
a user opts to click on an ad, the click trafﬁc is bounced
through a number of hosts such as click servers before
reaching the advertiser’s web page. This click is paid for
by the advertiser and the revenue generated in this way
is shared between the publisher and the ad networks.
Popular
search ad networks
such as Google
AdWords and BingAds are considered to be top-tier
(premium), while other less reputable ones are 2nd-tier
or lower. Compared with other ad networks, top-tier net-
works offer a higher rate per click (CPC) to the publisher
and a better click fraud detection to the advertiser.
• Direct navigation trafﬁc (PPR). Direct navigation traf-
ﬁc (aka., type-in trafﬁc) is generated when the web user
enters a domain name as a query and expects to be
redirected to a related domain. For example, one may
type in “ﬁndcheaphotels.com” in the address bar and
land at mytravelguide.com. This is caused by

such a direct navigation system by redirecting type-in
trafﬁc to them who ultimately redirect it to trafﬁc buyers
like mytravelguide.com. This monetization option
is called Pay-Per-Redirect (PPR) or zeroclick.

Figure 2: Domain Parking Ecosystem
Domain parking services have a signiﬁcant hold in the
domain industry. Table 1 shows some of the most pop-
ular parking services investigated in our study. By look-
ing at the ranks of the domain names associated with
the companies running these parking services, we ﬁnd
that many of them are ranked among the top 100k by
Alexa [2]. Also shown in the table is the total num-
ber of parked domains observed on Feb. 25th accord-
ing to DailyChanges [34]. Note that the list maintained
by DailyChanges is not comprehensive. Nevertheless,
it is quite clear from Table 1 that parking services in-
deed cover a large number of domains. Here we describe
our understanding of its ecosystem, based on our analy-
sis of a large amount of data collected from the domains
under leading parking services. Such an understanding
also leads to the suspicion of illicit activities within this
ecosystem which motivates this research.
Infrastructure. Figure 2 illustrates the infrastructure of
the domain parking ecosystem, as revealed by the redi-
rection chains observed during our crawling of parked
domains. Those domains are the start nodes for the
