RedisCacheDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix ScriptAll users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.MediumYesNoDiagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days.Logs should be retained for a long enough period so that activity trail can be recreated when investigations are required in the event of an incident or a compromise. A period of 1 year is typical for several compliance requirements as well.MediumNoNoConfigure Redis Cache firewall settings for additional protectionUsing the firewall feature ensures that access to the data or the service is restricted to a specific set/group of clients. While this may not be feasible in all scenarios, when it can be used, it provides an extra layer of access control protection for critical assets.MediumYesNoRedis Data Persistence should be enabled to back up Redis Cache dataEnabling backup on Redis Cache ensures that there is always a previous snapshot of data that can be leveraged towards recovery scenarios.MediumYesNoNon-SSL port must not be enabledUse of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, session-hijacking attacks.HighYesYesAccess keys must be rotated periodicallyPeriodic key/password rotation is a good security hygiene practice as, over time, it minimizes the likelihood of data loss/compromise which can arise from key theft/brute forcing/recovery attacks.MediumNoNoDo not share cache instances across applicationsThere is no access control within a cache. If multiple applications share the same cache they will be able to freely access each others cached data which may lead to compromise.HighNoNoRedis Cache instance should be confined within a virtual network for domain-joined scenariosAzure Virtual Network (VNet) deployment provides enhanced security and isolation for Azure Redis Cache, as well as subnets, access control policies, and other features to further restrict access.MediumNoNo
