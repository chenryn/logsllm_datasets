### Redis Cache Security Controls

| Description | Rationale | Control Severity | Automated Fix Script Available? |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Granting minimum required permissions using RBAC ensures that users and identities have only the necessary access to perform their tasks. This minimizes the risk of resource exposure in case of a user or service account compromise. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Diagnostics Logs** | Diagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days. Retaining logs for a year is typical for compliance requirements and allows for activity trail recreation during incident investigations. | Medium | No | No |
| **Redis Cache Firewall Settings** | Configure Redis Cache firewall settings for additional protection. Using the firewall feature restricts access to specific clients, providing an extra layer of access control for critical assets. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Redis Data Persistence** | Enable Redis Data Persistence to back up Redis Cache data. This ensures that there is always a previous snapshot of data available for recovery scenarios. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Non-SSL Port** | The non-SSL port must not be enabled. Using HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking attacks. | High | Yes | Yes |
| **Periodic Key Rotation** | Access keys must be rotated periodically. Regular key rotation is a good security practice as it reduces the risk of data loss or compromise due to key theft, brute forcing, or recovery attacks. | Medium | No | No |
| **Cache Instance Sharing** | Do not share cache instances across applications. Since there is no access control within a cache, sharing the same instance can lead to cross-application data access, potentially resulting in a security compromise. | High | No | No |
| **Virtual Network Deployment** | Redis Cache instances should be confined within a virtual network for domain-joined scenarios. Azure Virtual Network (VNet) deployment provides enhanced security and isolation, including subnets and access control policies to further restrict access. | Medium | No | No |

This table outlines the essential security controls for Redis Cache, along with their rationale, severity, and whether an automated fix script is available.
