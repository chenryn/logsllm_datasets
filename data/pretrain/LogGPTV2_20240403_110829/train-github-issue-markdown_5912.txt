It looks like in version 3.x !important was added to .hide, the problem with
this is that now when you use hide on an element and then try to use jquerys
toggle functions the important is taking over and nothing happens. I've gotten
around this by doing slideToggle().removeClass('hide'); but it's ugly and the
first transition is not smooth at all. I'm not sure why hide has !important
now but if possible it should be removed.
