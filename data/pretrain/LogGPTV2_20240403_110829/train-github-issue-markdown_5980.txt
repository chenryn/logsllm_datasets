### Issue Type
Bug Report

### Component Name
`ec2_group` Integration Test

### Ansible Version
2.5

### Configuration
N/A

### Operating System / Environment
Shippable

### Summary
The `ec2_group` integration test is unstable and often fails.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the `ec2_group` integration test on Shippable.

### Expected Results
All tests should pass without any failures.

### Actual Results
The tests are unstable and sometimes fail. Specifically, the following assertion in `test/integration/targets/ec2_group/tasks/main.yml` at line 908 fails:

```yaml
- assert:
    that:
      - result.changed == true
      - result.ip_permissions_egress|length == 1
```

Failure details:
- **Assertion**: `result.ip_permissions_egress|length == 1`
- **Result**:
  ```json
  {
      "assertion": "result.ip_permissions_egress|length == 1",
      "changed": false,
      "evaluated_to": false,
      "failed": true
  }
  ```

### Additional Information
- The test failure can be observed in the Shippable run: [https://app.shippable.com/github/ansible/ansible/runs/54397/66/tests](https://app.shippable.com/github/ansible/ansible/runs/54397/66/tests)

This issue needs to be addressed to ensure the stability and reliability of the `ec2_group` integration test.
