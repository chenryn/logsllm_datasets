### Dialog Box Design for Effective User Warnings

**Key Components of Effective Warning Dialog Boxes:**
1. **Clear and Sufficient Warning:** The dialog box should provide a clear and detailed warning that allows users to easily understand the potential danger.
2. **Risk Overview and Consequences:** It should include an overview of the risks and possible consequences, presented in a way that users can believe and agree with.
3. **Actionable Recommendations:** The dialog box should offer actionable recommendations that motivate users to take appropriate actions.

**Non-Uniform UIs:**
Users often dismiss warnings due to habituation. To mitigate this, it is essential to use different dialog-box designs for different levels of severity. Additionally, randomizing the order of items in dialog boxes can help ensure that users pay attention to security decisions.

### 3.4 Feedback from Experts

**Background:**
Bravo-Lillo et al. have shown that novice users and security experts have different mental models [6]. To study how security experts determine the legitimacy of software and what advice they would give to novice users, we conducted a user study with security experts.

**Study Setup:**
- **Software Selection:** Based on prevalent security threats (Section 3.1), we selected 10 software items: 5 legitimate programs and 5 malware programs.
- **Participants:** We recruited 9 security experts with at least 5 years of experience in computer security.

**Procedure:**
- **Interactive Mockup:** We created an interactive PowerPoint and VisualBasic mockup of the Windows 7 OS and IE browser environment to simulate typical browsing behavior.
- **Scenarios:** Each scenario was based on common techniques for malware distribution (Section 3.1). Table 2 summarizes the 10 scenarios used in the study.

**Table 2: Scenarios Used in the Expert Study**

| Software              | Scenario Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MindMaple             | Alice clicks an ad for MindMaple while using ALZip.                                  |
| AhnLab                | Bob downloads AhnLab V3 Antivirus from Wikipedia.                                    |
| SPAMfighter Pro       | Bob downloads spam blocking software from Google search.                            |
| Kaspersky             | Alice installs Kaspersky from a sponsored link.                                       |
| Rkill                 | Bob downloads Rkill after reading forums.                                            |
| Windows Activation    | Alice tries to activate a pirated copy of Windows 7.                                  |
| Privacy Violation     | Alice encounters a privacy violation warning while browsing.                          |
| ActiveX Codec         | Bob is prompted to install ActiveX while watching a video.                           |
| HDD Diagnostic        | Alice finds a webpage claiming to scan her PC performance.                            |
| Adobe Flash Update    | Bob is prompted to download an Adobe Flash update while watching videos.             |

**Role-Playing:**
- **Observation:** Each expert observed a close friend (played by one of the authors) navigating through 10 randomized scenarios.
- **Questions:** At the end of each scenario, experts were asked:
  - Would you recommend downloading the software? [Yes / No / Not sure]
  - Why?
  - What evidence would you present to convince the user of the software's legitimacy?
  - How well do you know this software? [1 (don't know at all) – 5 (know very well)]

**Results:**
- **Initial Action:** All experts first examined the hosting website, regardless of prior knowledge.
- **Trusted Sources:** They emphasized the importance of downloading from reputable and trusted websites.
- **User Intention:** Experts noted that user intention is crucial; they would not recommend downloading from pop-ups or irrelevant sources.
- **Software Reviews:** Careful examination of reviews from trusted sources was deemed critical.
- **Machine Security:** Running updated antivirus software was also highlighted as important.

**Flowchart:**
- **Expert Flowcharts:** Each expert drew a flowchart to guide their friends in determining software legitimacy.
- **Common Elements:** Hosting site, user intention, software review, and machine security were the main points.
- **Merged Flowchart:** A simplified and merged flowchart (Figure 2) was created, including an additional step: "Were you urged to download?"

**Discussion:**
- **Simplicity and Reliability:** Experts did not rely on special knowledge, and their reasoning was straightforward. This suggests that an enhanced user interface can empower even novice users to make informed security decisions.

### 4. OTO: USER INTERFACE WITH TRUST EVIDENCE

**Introduction:**
OTO is an interface designed based on the findings from the expert study. It provides clues about the safety of downloading files, presenting both reasons for and against the installation.

**Design Overview:**
- **Activation:** OTO is activated when a user initiates a download or cancels a download but the process continues.
- **Attention Grabbing:** The entire screen grays out to ensure full user attention and verify that OTO is a legitimate OS-certified program.

**Figures 3–5: Examples of the OTO Interface**
- **Potentially Malicious Software:** OTO displays a clear warning and gathered evidence to help users decide whether to proceed with the download.

**Evidence Types:**
- **Reasons for Safety:** Evidence indicating the file may be safe.
- **Reasons for Harm:** Evidence indicating the file may be harmful.

**Display of Evidence:**
- **Detailed Presentation:** OTO presents the evidence in a clear and organized manner, allowing users to make informed decisions.

By incorporating these elements, OTO aims to enhance user security awareness and decision-making.
