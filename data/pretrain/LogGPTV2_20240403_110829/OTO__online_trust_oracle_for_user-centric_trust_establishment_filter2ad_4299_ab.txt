dialog boxes should provide suﬃcient warning evidence so
that users can easily understand the danger; an overview of
the risks and possible consequences that users can believe
and agree with; and actionable recommendations that users
feel motivated to act upon [10].
Non-uniform UIs.
Users tend to dismiss warnings, of-
ten due to habituation. To prevent this, it is important
to provide diﬀerent dialog-box designs for diﬀerent levels of
severity [10]. Furthermore, randomizing the order of items
in dialog boxes is eﬀective in forcing users to pay attention
to security decisions [7].
3.4 Feedback from Experts
As Bravo-Lillo et al. have shown, novice users have dif-
ferent mental models compared to security experts [6]. In
order to study how security experts determine the legitimacy
of software and what advice they would give to novice users,
we ﬁrst ran a user study on security experts.
Based on the prevalent security threats as described in
Section 3.1, we selected 10 software items for our study: 5
legitimate software programs and 5 malware programs.
Experts’ user study. We created a scenario for each
software in Table 1 based on the commonly used techniques
for malware distribution as described in Section 3.1. We
recruited 9 security experts who have been studying and
working in the computer security ﬁeld for at least 5 years.
Procedure. We created an interactive PowerPoint and
VisualBasic mockup of the Windows 7 OS and IE browser
environment to mimic a user’s typical browsing behavior;

Scenario
Alice has been using ALZip, which is a free ﬁle compression program that she downloaded from the Internet. One day,
Alice notices an advertisement for MindMaple on the ALZip interface and decides to click. As she clicks, a new browser
window opens, showing the webpage of MindMaple – a mind-mapping software to enhance the management of multiple
projects, ideas, etc. Alice skims through the webpage and she is about to click a link to try MindMaple for free.
Bob does not have antivirus software installed and he believes his computer is infected with a virus. Bob searches Google
for ’antivirus’ and navigates to a Wikipedia article that contains a list of antivirus software. After looking at several
options he decides to download AhnLab V3 Antivirus. He clicks the link for AhnLab on the Wikipedia page and clicks
the download link on the AhnLab website.
Bob is tired of getting spam so he decides to download spam blocking software. He searches Google for ’spam ﬁlter
spamﬁghter’ and navigates to the SPAMFighter website. He clicks the ‘Start Download Now’ button and is redirected to
a similar page with instructions to select ‘Run anyway’ if Internet Explorer SmartScreen issues a warning. He clicks on
‘Start Download Now.’
Alice’s computer does not have an antivirus program installed, so she decides to install one. She searches Google for
’antivirus software’ and decides to click on the sponsored link for Kaspersky. She clicks on the link for a free 30-day trial,
ﬁlls in some personal details, and clicks the download button.
Bob believes his computer is infected with malware. He reads two forums on free malware removal software and an
article describing Rkill as the repair tool of the week. He decides to try Rkill and searches Google for ‘rkill download.’
Bob clicks on the link for the CNET download page and then clicks on the ‘Download Now’ button.
Alice’s PC was installed with a pirated copy of Windows 7 which she downloaded from a ﬁle sharing website. She
has had no problems with her PC so far, and is completing a homework assignment that requires a photo editor. Alice
searches Google for ‘free adobe photo editor torrent’ and selects the ﬁrst link in the search results. She is trying to ﬁnd
the download button when a window appears prompting her to call a number to receive an activation code for Windows.
Alice has noticed that her PC has been running slowly, so she searches Google for ’windows 7 is slow.’ After looking
through several options she navigates to a page titled ‘Registry Clean Up.’ While browsing the webpage a window appears
with a warning about privacy violations found on her computer. She clicks on the ’Repair Now!’ button.
Bob is bored at home and decides to watch a movie. He searches Google for ‘batman begins’ and selects a UStream video.
While waiting for the video to load a dialog box appears over the video window stating that there was an error displaying
the video and prompts him to install ActiveX to ﬁx this error.
Alice’s computer has been making some weird noises. Alice decides to search for a solution on Google. She ﬁnds a
webpage titled ‘Windows 7 making weird buzzing noises.’ As she browses the webpage, a window appears claiming that
it is scanning the computer to analyze PC performance. Alice clicks the ‘Pause’ button.
Bob enjoys watching videos by ’Just for laughs TV.’ He searches Google for ‘just for laughs gags’ and looks through
several options before selecting a Youtube video to watch. After Bob ﬁnishes the ﬁrst video, he decides to click on
a related video. While waiting for the video to load a dialog box appears over the video window prompting him to
download an update for Adobe Flash Player.
each scenario is composed of a sequence of Windows 7 desk-
top screenshot slides, each of which shows a web browser
with a diﬀerent website based on the scenario. The next
slide is triggered when a user clicks an appropriate area in-
side the browser. For example, the ActiveX codec scenario
starts with a Google result page of ’batman begins,’ and
asks the user to click a particular link (e.g., UStream link)
to proceed. Such a click triggers the next slide, displaying
the UStream webpage with an active progress bar. Shortly
after, the following slide displays an ActiveX codec error,
asking the user to install ActiveX to ﬁx this error.1
To obtain responses that experts would provide in typical
situations, we asked each expert to pretend to be watch-
ing a close friend who is using a computer and is about to
download software. For this role-playing, one of the authors
pretended to be a close friend of each expert, and we asked
each expert to observe the author’s browsing behavior for 10
diﬀerent scenarios. For each expert, we presented 10 scenar-
ios in randomized order. Table 2 summarizes the scenarios
that we used for our study.
At the end of each scenario, we asked the following ques-
tions to analyze the types of evidence that experts use to
determine the software’s legitimacy:
1Note that our mockup of the Windows 7 environment is indistin-
guishable to the real Windows 7 environment, as commented by
study participants.
• Would you recommend that Alice proceeds and downloads
the software? [Yes / No / Not sure]
• [If Yes or No] Why?
• [If Not sure] What would you do to ﬁnd out the le-
gitimacy of this software?
• What evidence would you present to Alice to convince her
of the legitimacy of this software?
• How well do you know this software? [1 (don’t know at
all) – 5 (know very well)]
The last question is to analyze whether their prior knowl-
edge aﬀects how they recommend software. After all 10 sce-
narios, we asked each expert to draw a ﬂow chart that shows
how (s)he decides about the software legitimacy in general.
We emphasized that this ﬂow chart is to help educate their
close friends in determining the software legitimacy. At the
end of the study, we asked each expert to provide feedback
on the download dialog box that we designed.
In general, the ﬁrst action that all the experts
Results.
took was examining the downloading software’s hosting web-
site carefully, regardless of their prior knowledge. All 9 ex-
perts emphasized the importance of downloading software
from a trusted and reputable website, and indicated that
they would go directly to the publisher of the software. If
users are not on the publisher’s website, the experts would
ascertain if the URLs and the website content looks legit-
imate. If the hosting website does not look reputable, the

table illustrates processing operations that the experts indicated in
their own ﬂowchart, and the number of experts who mentioned the
same processing operation.
Processing operation
Software review
• Are reviews available from reputable sources, experts, or
friends?
• Are the reviews good?
• Do a lot of people use the software?
Hosting site
• Is the hosting site reputable?
• What is the corporate parameter (e.g., number of employees,
age of the company) of the site?
• Is the site related to the software to be downloaded?
• Are you being redirected from advertisements, emails, etc.?
• Does the site have a high rank on Google using general
search terms?
• Does the company have a physical location near where you
live?
User intention
• Did you search for that speciﬁc software?
• Are you familiar with this software?
• Do you really need it?
• Are you downloading from a pop-up?
Securing machines
• Do you run an updated antivirus?
• Is your machine trusted?

experts would search for the same software from a reputable
source. Alternatively, 8 experts agreed that they would con-
sider the (unknown) hosting site as reliable if Google’s search
query with general terms (e.g., “antivirus”) provides a high
page rank for that host; on the other hand, 1 expert men-
tioned that it would be “possible to poison Google’s search
results” for very speciﬁc terms (e.g., “AhnLab V3 antivirus”).
All the experts also emphasized user intention to be an
important factor for judging software legitimacy. For ex-
ample, all experts pointed out, throughout the study, that
they would not recommend their friends to download soft-
ware from pop-up windows conveying information that is
irrelevant to the original search. This is because the soft-
ware advertised in the pop-up window is highly unlikely to
be what the user intends to download, and highly unlikely to
be legitimate. On the other hand, if users proactively click
to download the software that they have been searching for,
the experts mentioned that the likelihood of downloading
malware may be low.
All the experts also emphasized that carefully examining
software reviews by trusted authorities or experts is critical.
Before downloading software, all the experts would recom-
mend users to research the downloading software’s reviews
from reputable sources (besides the hosting site). For exam-
ple, the experts suggested checking (1) the total number of
people currently using the software, (2) positive and nega-
tive reviews, and (3) business information for the software
vendor.
Two experts mentioned that securing machines is also im-
portant. For example, one way to reduce malware download
would be running antivirus software that is up-to-date.
Flowchart.
At the end of the study, we asked each ex-
pert to draw a ﬂowchart that their friends could use as a
guideline for future downloads.
In general, every expert’s
detailed thinking process was unique. However, they all il-
lustrated the same main points, in particular hosting site,
user intention, software review, and securing machine as de-
scribed above. Table 3 summarizes the frequency of diﬀer-
ent process operations that the experts drew. We merged all

additional processing operation: Were you urged to down-

especially ransomware, scare users into immediately down-

Discussion.
An interesting observation from this study
was that the experts did not rely on special knowledge and
their reasoning was simple. Although this study did not re-
veal groundbreaking facts from security experts, such results
are promising since an enhanced user interface may empower
even novice users to make correct security decisions.
4. OTO: USER INTERFACE WITH TRUST
EVIDENCE
In this section, we introduce OTO, which we designed
and modiﬁed based on the four design points and the re-
sults/feedback from the expert study in Section 3. OTO is
an interface that displays clues about the safety of down-
loading ﬁles.
OTO provides both reasons why the downloading ﬁle may
be safe to install, and reasons why the downloading ﬁle may
be harmful to the computer. Figures 3–5 show examples
of the OTO interface. With OTO, users can make informed
decisions about proceeding with or canceling the downloads.
In Section 4.1, we describe the design overview of OTO, and
in Section 4.2, we delineate a list of evidence types that are
suitable for OTO. In Section 4.3, we describe how evidence
is displayed in the OTO interface.
4.1 OTO Interface Overview
As shown in Figure 3, OTO is displayed when a user’s
action leads to the downloading of software; for example, the
user actively clicks to download or (s)he clicks the “cancel”
or “close” button but the download continues.
We assume that a system-level trusted path exists, such
that when a ﬁle is about to be downloaded, the OS can de-
tect it and activate OTO. When OTO is activated, the entire
screen grays out, which will catch the users’ full attention
and ensure that OTO is a legitimate OS-certiﬁed program
and not another malware program.
