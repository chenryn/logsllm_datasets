to determine if they will answer an incoming call, creating a
unique challenge for warning designs. This research addresses
this challenge and provides insight for future work in this area.
IX. CONCLUSION
Cell phone users are interrupted by robocalls daily. Tele-
phone providers and third-party organizations have developed
applications to solve this problem by detecting and blocking
robocalls. This research surveyed the top third-party anti-
robocall apps, identiﬁed strong spam call warning indicators
for users, and determined the effectiveness of warnings for
spam calls. We reviewed the top ten robocall apps and found
that 1) they all use blacklists to detect robocalls calls and 2)
the majority of spam call warnings used in these apps placed a
red bar in the middle of the screen. We then held focus groups
which found that all of our participants 1) relied on Caller ID,
and 2) desired a spam call warning that uses a checkmark and
prohibition sign, along with an alerting background color that
ﬁlls the entire screen. We applied these design elements to
the Available and Focus categories respectively, and compared
their effect on users to each other and to the Control category
design which had no warning. The results show that warning
designs can change user behavior and reliance on Caller ID. In
particular, the number of answered spoofed calls decreased by
43% when the spam warning removed the name of the caller
and had a red background in the middle of the screen. We
believe future research should further investigate the removal
of Caller ID, use of multimodal warnings that include visual,
audible and physical cues, and how robocall warning indicators
perform in the wild.

3)
You received a call and see the following on your
phone (show device), what do you do? This will be
asked multiple times.
If you were asked to be a consultant for the Authen-
tiCall company, what changes would you make to the
app?
D.
Interactive Study Survey Debrief Questions
1)
Can you tell me about what you saw on the cell
phone?
How did feel while taking the survey?
2)
3) What do you think about the various alerts you saw?
Did any of the alerts or things you saw stand out to
4)
you? Anything stuck in your memory?
5) What did you do when you got a call from Harold
Rogers or Veranda Gardens?
6) What are your thoughts about design 1?
7) What are your thoughts about design 2?
8) What are your thoughts about design 3?
9) Which design did you like the most?
10) Which design did you like the least?
11) Was anything missing from the designs?

APPENDIX
A. Repeated Advice from Participants on How to Handle Spam
Calls
Below you will ﬁnd the responses received by at least 2
participants on handling spam calls.
1)

6)
7)
8)
9)
10)
11)
12)
Check the ﬁrst 6 digits of the incoming number. If it
matches yours, its more than likely a spam call
Check the area code and determine if the call is
coming from a location you’d expect it to
Block numbers that you know are spam callers
Send suspicious numbers to voicemail and check the
voicemail later
If you receive a call from a company, it’s okay to
hang up. If they really want to contact you, they’ll
send you a letter in the mail or email you
Save number’s from companies or people you trust
so you’ll be sure to answer when they call.
If they’re asking you for money of the phone its a
scam
Sign-up for the national do not call registry
Report spam callers to the proper authorities or see
if your provider can help you
Download an app to help you
Don’t answer calls from unknown numbers
Asked to be removed from the spam callers list
B. Focus Group Questions
1)
2)
3)
4)
Please state your name, major, and type of phone you
have
Please walk me through your thought process when
you receive a phone call
Take a moment and think about all of the spam calls
you’ve answered. Please recall your most memorable
experience. If you don’t have a memorable experi-
ence, please discuss something about spam calls that
has stuck with you.
You’ve recently met someone who is having a hard
time with spam calls. They ask you 2 questions.
Please state your response to each
a)
How do you know if an incoming call is a
spam call?
b) What should I do about spam calls? How do
I solve this problem?
5) We will now be taking about 10 minutes to brainstorm
independently. I will be asking you two questions
and you will need to write and draw your answer.
You won’t have to show the group, but we will be
collecting the papers for our research.
If you were to use an app to help with spam calls,
please illustrate and write what you think it would
look like and how you’d expect it to behave
I will now be showing you 5 photos. If you saw this
on your phone, what would you think it means?
6)
C. Think Aloud Questions
1)
You have just downloaded this app, Authenticall, to
protect you from spam calls. Without knowing how
the app works, please tell me what you think you
should be able to do with this application
