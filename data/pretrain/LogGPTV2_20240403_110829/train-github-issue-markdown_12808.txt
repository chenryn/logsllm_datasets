I tried getting the inverse (related to issue #646), and it worked fine sort
of. Here is some pseudocode of what I was trying to do.
    def get_distances(...):
      svd code here to get inverse matrix
      return distances
    def energy(params, positions, cell):
       get distances, do calculation
       return energy
    def forces(params, positions, cell):
        dedr = grad(energy, 1)
        return -dedr(...)  # works fine
    def stress(params, position, cell):
       def e0(params, positions, cell, strain):
           modify positions and cell with strain
           return energy(params, newpositions, newcell)
       deds = grad(e0, 3)
       return deds(params, positions, cell, np.zeros(3)) 
The last function gave me this error:  
`NotImplementedError: Forward-mode differentiation rule for 'svd' not
implemented`
I guess the issue is that the strain modifies the cell, which is the array I
need an inverse of, and this triggers the need for a derivative through the
svd, and it is evidently not implemented.
It seems like a clear error, so this is mostly a report I guess that it is not
implemented. It isn't obvious where that would be done. Any hints?
