Theano has supported multiple GPUs since v0.8.0.  
(cf. Using multiple GPUs â€” Theano 0.8.0 documentation )  
Does Keras also support using multiple GPUs?
For example, can I run the below task?
  1. Learn a sequential model A on gpu0
  2. Learn a sequential model B on gpu1
  3. Merge A and B on gpu0
