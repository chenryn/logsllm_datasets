User: Please describe what is a DDoS attack in network security, and give some methods to defend against DDoS attacks.
Assistant: DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service) refers to an attack method in which the attacker sends a large amount of forged traffic to the target server or network to make the target system unstable or unable to work normally. Attackers can use multiple attacker-controlled hosts (Botnet) to launch attacks, making the scale of attacks larger and more difficult to defend. DDoS attacks usually consume the bandwidth and system resources of the target system, making it impossible for legitimate users to normally access or use the target system or service. The following are some methods of defending against DDoS attacks: 1. Anti-DDoS attack defense scheme based on traffic cleaning. By analyzing and filtering the traffic entering the system, screen out illegal traffic, cut it off or reduce its impact on the system. 2. Anti-DDoS attack solution based on CDN (Content Distribution Network). CDN is a distributed network architecture that distributes data to the nearest node at the edge of the network, thereby speeding up data transmission. CDN can absorb part of the attack traffic to ensure the stability of its services. 3. In the anti-DDoS attack solution, topology optimization. By changing the network topology, it can effectively reduce the bandwidth occupied by malicious traffic. 4. Enterprises are acquiring various ISP (Internet Service Provider) ports, improving network connectivity, and ensuring the scalability of existing systems as much as possible in network design, and avoiding bottlenecks as much as possible to deal with large-scale DDoS attack. It should be noted that resisting DDoS attacks requires the combined use of multiple means to achieve better defense effects. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain a good network security environment, strengthen education and training for employees on network security, and improve employees' security awareness.
