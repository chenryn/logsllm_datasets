User: OS: ubuntu 16.04LTS
Python: 2.7.12 + Anaconda2-4.2.0 (64 bit)
I typed pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL to install tensorflow but terminal showed that my pip verson was 8.1.1, however version 9.0.1 is available. 
Then I typed pip install --upgrade pip to upgrade but it showed 
Requirement already up-to-date: pip in ./anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages, 
I still can't use pip version 9.0.1 to install tensorflow. Does anyone know what's going on ??
Assistant: cannot install pip 9 for python3 on ubuntu16 with pip or pip3
solve by: sudo apt-get upgrade python3-pip  (here may be run the apt update first.)

pip3 -V
pip 9.0.1 from /home/roofe/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)
