ABSTRACT
Understanding data plane health is essential to improving
Internet reliability and usability. For instance, detecting dis-
ruptions in peer and provider networks can identify repairable
connectivity problems. Currently this task is time consum-
ing as it involves a fair amount of manual observation, as an
operator has poor visibility beyond their network’s border.
In this paper we leverage existing public RIPE Atlas mea-
surement data to monitor and analyze network conditions;
creating no new measurements. We demonstrate a set of
complementary methods to detect network disruptions using
traceroute measurements, and to report problems in near real
time. A novel method of detecting changes in delay is used
to identify congested links, and a packet forwarding model
is employed to predict trafﬁc paths and to identify faulty
routers and links in cases of packet loss.
In addition, ag-
gregating results from each method allows us to easily mon-
itor a network and correlate related reports of signiﬁcant net-
work disruptions, reducing uninteresting alarms. Our contri-
butions consist of a statistical approach to providing robust
estimation of Internet delays and the study of hundreds of
thousands link delays. We present three cases demonstrat-
ing that the proposed methods detect real disruptions and
provide valuable insights, as well as surprising ﬁndings, on
the location and impact of the identiﬁed events.
1.
INTRODUCTION
The Internet’s decentralized design allows disparate
networks to cooperate and provides resilience to failure.
However, signiﬁcant network disruptions inevitably de-
grade users’ connectivity. The ﬁrst step to improve
reliability is to understand the health of the current
Internet. While network operators usually understand
their own network’s condition, understanding the state
of the multi-provider Internet beyond their own network
border remains a crucial but hard task. Monitoring
multiple networks’ health is diﬃcult, and far too often
requires many manual observations. For example, net-
work operators’ group mailing lists are a common way
to signal and share knowledge about network disrup-
tions [13]. Manual network measurements, such as ping
and traceroute assist in diagnosing connectivity issues
from a few vantage points but they suﬀer from poor
visibility.
We investigate the potential of existing data from a
large-scale measurement platform, RIPE Atlas [5], to
systematically detect and locate network disruptions.
The widespread deployment of Atlas probes provides an
extensive view of the Internet that has proved beneﬁcial
for postmortem reports [8, 9, 31]. Designing automated
detection tools for such large-scale platforms is chal-
lenging. The high variability of network performance
metrics, such as round trip time (RTT), is a key obsta-
cle for reliable event detection [36]. Beyond detecting
network disruptions, pinpointing their location is quite
challenging due to traﬃc asymmetry and packet loss.
We examine these challenges (§ 3) and propose meth-
ods to monitor the health of the vast number of net-
works probed by Atlas traceroutes. First, we devise a
method to monitor RTT from traceroute results and
report links with unusual delays (§ 4). This method
takes advantage of the wide deployment of Atlas by
monitoring links from numerous vantage points, accu-
rately measuring delay changes. Second, we explore a
packet forwarding model to learn and predict forward-
ing behavior and pinpoint faulty routers experiencing
sudden packet loss (§ 5). Finally, we present a tech-
nique to aggregate these signals per network and detect
inter-related events (§ 6). These methods are all based
on robust statistics which cope with outliers commonly
found in traceroute measurements.
The contributions of this work reside in the statis-
tical approach to monitoring Internet delays. Despite
noisy RTT measurements, the introduced delay estima-
tor infers very stable link delays and permits accurate
predictions for anomaly detection. It also enables the
monitoring of delays and forwarding patterns for hun-
dreds of thousands links. We provide our tools [4] and
report problems in near real time [2, 3] so that other
can build upon our work. Our proposal employs only
existing data hence adding no burden to the network.
To validate our methods we investigate three signiﬁ-
cant network events in 2015 (§ 7), each demonstrating
key beneﬁts of our techniques. The ﬁrst analyzes the
1
impact of a DDoS infrastructure attack. The second
shows congestion in a tier-1 ISP caused by inadvertent
rerouting of signiﬁcant traﬃc. And the last presents
connectivity issues at an Internet Exchange due to a
technical fault.
2. DATASET
To monitor as many links in the meshy Internet as
possible, we need a vast number of vantage points col-
lecting network performance data. With its impressive
spread across the globe and almost 10,000 probes con-
stantly connected, RIPE Atlas is the best candidate.
Atlas performs, among others, two classes of repeti-
tive measurements providing an extensive collection of
traceroute data publicly available in near real time. The
ﬁrst type, builtin measurements, consists of traceroutes
from all Atlas probes to instances of the 13 DNS root
servers every 30 minutes. Due to the wide distribution
of probes and the anycast DNS root server deployment,
this is actually to over 500 root server instances. The
second type, anchoring measurements, are traceroutes
to 189 collaborative servers (super probes) from about
400 normal probes every 15 minutes. All measurements
employ Paris traceroute [12] to mitigate issues raised by
load balancers and link aggregation [36].
We have analyzed the builtin and anchoring measure-
ments from May 1st to December 31st 2015, correspond-
ing to a total of 2.8 billion IPv4 traceroutes (1.2 billion
IPv6 traceroutes) from a total of 11,538 IPv4 probes
(4,307 IPv6 probes) connected within the eight studied
months.
As our study relies solely on traceroute results the
scope and terminology of this paper are constrained to
the IP layer. That is, a link refers to a pair of IP ad-
dresses rather than a physical cable.
Consequently, the proposed methods suﬀer from com-
mon limitations faced by traceroute data [29, 40, 28].
Traceroute visibility is limited to the IP space, hence,
changes at lower layers that are not visible at the IP
layer can be misinterpreted. For example, the RIPE
Atlas data reports MPLS information if routers support
RFC4950. But for routers not supporting RFC4950, the
reconﬁguration of an MPLS tunnel is not visible with
traceroutes while being likely to impact observed delays.
The RTT values reported by traceroute include both
network delays and routers’ slow path delay [28]. There-
fore, the delay changes found using traceroute data are
not to be taken as actual delay increases experienced by
TCP/UDP traﬃc, though they are good for detecting
network damage.
3. CHALLENGES AND RELATED WORK
Monitoring network performance with traceroute raises
three key challenges. In this section, we present these
challenges, discuss how they were tackled in previous

work, and give hints of our approach to be discussed in
detail later.
Challenge 1: Traﬃc asymmetry. Traceroutes are
a rich source of information for monitoring Internet de-
lay. They reveal the path to a destination and provide
RTTs for every router on this path. Each RTT value is
the sum of the time spent to reach a certain IP address
and the travel time for the corresponding reply. Due to
the asymmetry and diversity of routes [45, 53] the paths
taken by the forwarding and returning packets often dif-
fer; also traceroute is unable to reveal IP addresses on
the return path. Path asymmetry is very common; past
studies report about 90% of AS-level routes as asym-
metric [42, 16]. For these reasons one must take par-
ticular care when comparing RTT values for diﬀerent
hops.
For instance, quantifying the delay between two ad-
jacent hops can be baﬄing. Figure 1 illustrates this
by breaking down the RTT from the probe P to router
B (blue in Fig. 1a) and the one to the following hop,
router C (red in Fig. 1a). The solid lines represent the
forward path exposed by traceroute, and the dotted the
unrevealed return path. If we want to measure the de-
lay between routers B and C using only the information
provided by traceroute (i.e. solid lines in Fig. 1), one is
tempted to compute the delay between B and C as the
diﬀerence between the RTT to B and the one to C. But
the resulting value is likely incorrect when forward and
return paths are asymmetric. Packets returning from
C are not going through B but D, a router not seen
on the forward path.
If one is monitoring the diﬀer-
ence between the two RTTs over time and identifying
an abnormality, then it is unclear if a change is due to
abnormal delay on link BC, CD, DA, or BA (Fig. 1b).
Previous studies approach this using reverse tracer-
oute techniques based on IP options to expose the re-
turn path [24, 32]. Using these techniques Luckie et
al. [28] ﬁlter out routers with diﬀerent forward and re-
turn paths and characterize congestion for the remain-
ing routers. Due to the limitations of these reverse
traceroute techniques [15] and the strong asymmetry
of Internet traﬃc [16], they could study only 29.9% of
the routers observed in their experiments.
Coordinated probing from both ends of the path is
another way to reveal asymmetric paths and correspond-
ing delays [17, 14]. However, coordinated probing re-
quires synchronized control on hosts located at both
ends of the path, which is diﬃcult in practice and lim-
its the probing surface.
Tulip [30] and cing [11] bypass the traﬃc asymmetry
problem by measuring delays with ICMP options but
require routers to implement these options.
In Section 4.1 we review the asymmetric paths prob-
lem and propose a new approach that takes advantage of
multiple probes and path diversity to accurately mon-
itor delay ﬂuctuations for links visited from diﬀerent
vantage points.
Challenge 2: RTT variability. As packets traverse
multiple links, routers, queues, and middleboxes, they
are exposed to multiple sources of delay that result in
complex RTT dynamics. This phenomenon has been
studied since the early years of the Internet and is still
of interest as comprehensive understanding of delay is
a key step to understanding network conditions [38, 19,
43, 35]. Simply stated, monitoring delay is a delicate
task because RTT samples are contaminated by various
noise sources.
In the literature, RTTs are monitored
with diﬀerent goals in mind. Minimum RTT values re-
veal propagation and transmission delays but ﬁlter out
delays from transient congestion, so are commonly used
to compute geographic distance in IP geolocation sys-
