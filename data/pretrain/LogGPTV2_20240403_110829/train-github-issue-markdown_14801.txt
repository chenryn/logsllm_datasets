## Description
The code described in the Celery documentation no longer works with Celery 5.0 and later versions. Specifically, the documentation at the following URL:
- [Extending Command Options](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/extending.html#extending-commandoptions)

Upon reviewing the Celery source code, it appears that `user_options` is now expected to be a `set()`. In fact, they are initialized as a `defaultdict(set())`.

I believe that one should provide a `click.option`, but when I attempted to do so, the implementation still failed because `click` is later accessing whatever is provided in `.opts`.

## Suggestions
1. **Update the Documentation**: Modify the documentation to reflect the correct usage of `click.option` for extending command options.
2. **Modify the Code**: Adjust the code to allow the example provided in the documentation to work with the new `set()` requirement for `user_options`.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.
