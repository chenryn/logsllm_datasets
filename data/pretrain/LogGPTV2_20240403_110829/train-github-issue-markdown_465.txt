All of the base jumps refer us back to the "get set for basejumps" waypoint
for a review of cloud9, etc to setup the appropriate environment. However,
half the pages (as you step through the 14 pages for that waypoint) FORCE you
to open an external site in order to progress to the next page. It's a
horrible user experience the first time through, and even worse if you go back
to review and just want to refresh your memory and end up with half a dozen
pages open just to get to the info you wanted.
Also, all the base jumps say to go back to this section in order to review how
to setup Heroko, and there's no instructions for Heroku.
