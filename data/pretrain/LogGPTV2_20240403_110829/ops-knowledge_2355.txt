User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to know which SSH user deleted my folder? We have a linux server in our lab which is shared among a number of developers. Server credentials (NOT root) are known to all and they log in using SSH. Now, when I logged in today I just realized that someone has deleted the folder I working on. It was there till yesterday EOD but has gone now. How can I know who deleted my folder ?

**EDIT :- ** 
I have just discovered the last command with some greps it gives a list of IPs from where a user logged in, that is great information, however it doesn't solve my purpose completely. I just want to know who deleted my folder. I just want to know if someone is willingly doing it since it has happened before also and restoring everything every time is just frustrating.

Assistant: You can't. If you are the administrator of the machine, you could enable auditing functionality, but this doesn't help for past events. 

Get your backups. And talk to your admin to get a good permission system and/or auditing in place.
