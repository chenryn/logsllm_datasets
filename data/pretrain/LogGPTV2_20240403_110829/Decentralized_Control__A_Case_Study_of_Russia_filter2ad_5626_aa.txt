Abstract—Until now, censorship research has largely focused
on highly centralized networks that rely on government-run
technical choke-points, such as the Great Firewall of China.
Although it was previously thought to be prohibitively difﬁcult,
large-scale censorship in decentralized networks are on the
rise. Our in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying
decentralized information control
in Russia shows that such
large-scale censorship can be achieved in decentralized networks
through inexpensive commodity equipment. This new form of
information control presents a host of problems for censorship
measurement, including difﬁculty identifying censored content, re-
quiring measurements from diverse perspectives, and variegated
censorship mechanisms that require signiﬁcant effort to identify
in a robust manner.
By working with activists on the ground in Russia, we ob-
tained ﬁve leaked blocklists signed by Roskomnadzor, the Russian
government’s federal service for mass communications, along
with seven years of historical blocklist data. This authoritative list
contains domains, IPs, and subnets that ISPs have been required
to block since November 1st, 2012. We used the blocklist from
April 24 2019, that contains 132,798 domains, 324,695 IPs, and 39
subnets, to collect active measurement data from residential, data
center and infrastructural vantage points. Our vantage points
span 408 unique ASes that control ≈ 65% of Russian IP address
space.
Our ﬁndings suggest that data centers block differently from
the residential ISPs both in quantity and in method of blocking,
resulting in different experiences of the Internet for residential
network perspectives and data center perspectives. As expected,
residential vantage points experience high levels of censorship.
While we observe a range of blocking techniques, such as TCP/IP
blocking, DNS manipulation, or keyword based ﬁltering, we ﬁnd
that residential ISPs are more likely to inject blockpages with
explicit notices to users when censorship is enforced. Russia’s cen-
sorship architecture is a blueprint, and perhaps a forewarning of
what and how national censorship policies could be implemented
in many other countries that have similarly diverse ISP ecosys-
tems to Russia’s. Understanding decentralized control will be key
to continuing to preserve Internet freedom for years to come.

the technology to enable that control is cheaper and easier to
use than ever. Countries such as China and Iran have been

decades, receiving signiﬁcant global and academic attention as
a result [4], [31], [44], [84]. As more citizens of the world begin
to use the Internet and social media, and political tensions begin
to run high, countries with less centralized networks have also
started to ﬁnd tools to exert control over the Internet. Recent
years have seen many unsophisticated attempts to wrestle with
decentralized networks, such as Internet shutdowns which, due
to their relative ease of execution, have become the de facto
censorship method of choice in some countries [14], [36],
[83]. While some preliminary studies investigating information
control in decentralized networks have examined India [89],
Thailand [27], Portugal [60], [61], and other countries, there has
yet to be an in-depth multifaceted exploration of the speciﬁc
tools and mechanisms used by governments for decentralized
information control as they evolve over time.
Governments seeking to implement a homogeneous national
censorship policy can pursue one of two intuitive options. The
ﬁrst is a centralized control that relies on government-run
technical choke points with several layers of complexity, a
major government investment that requires an overhaul of the
country’s network topology. The most notorious example of
this, the Great Firewall of China, has cost the country hundreds
of millions of dollars [20] over two decades. The second option
is to pursue censorship through decentralized control, a task
that we have until now deemed to be prohibitively difﬁcult: the
case of the Heartbleed vulnerability, where it took 3 months
for the gradual installation of patches to reduce vulnerability
from nearly 12% of top sites to 3% even after direct disclosure
to ISP administrators [18], is an example of the difﬁculty of
coordinating ISPs and their policies. Our study questions the
assumption that decentralized network control is too technically
difﬁcult and expensive to execute.
To our knowledge, no in-depth study has been performed
to assess the feasibility of real-time, effective, and homoge-
neous information control in a decentralized network. Such
a study would require measurements from diverse vantage
points, such as ISP backbones to data centers and last-
mile residential networks, among others. Furthermore, the
research also necessitates knowledge of the country in order
to determine what topics, like language, religion or politics,
governments are most sensitive to: this makes it challenging
to build an exhaustive list of blocked websites. Moreover,
even distinguishing between censorship and run-of-the-mill
network failures is often difﬁcult, so an insight into the intent
of the censor is crucial
to establishing which events are
censorship events. Finally, determining who is actually doing
the blocking can be difﬁcult: governments, individual ISPs,
and even servers themselves may refuse to serve trafﬁc for a
variety of reasons, for instance prioritizing certain customers
due to their location [47]. A study examining decentralized
information control must account for all of these factors to
effectively test the hypothesis of whether decentralized networks
can be uniformly censored.
United States [8] and Portugal [60], [61] are both moving away
from net neutrality (though not without resistance [53]), and
the United Kingdom’s legal framework for identifying and
restricting content is almost identical to Russia’s [75].
While countries such as India, Thailand, and Portugal
are also pursuing decentralized control, the largest and most
aggressive country to do so is Russia, which accounts for a
sixth of Europe’s Internet users [35]. Their censorship regime
has grown rapidly over the past decade, with the adoption of
policies and laws that facilitate control. We spent a year in
continuous discussion with in-country Russian activists who
helped us obtain ﬁve leaked snapshots of the government’s
ofﬁcial “blocklist” digitally signed by Roskomnadzor, a primary
entity in charge of nationwide Russian Internet censorship. This
blocklist contains the list of domains, IPs, and subnets that the
Russian authorities have required ISPs to block, and each of
its daily iterations since November 1st, 2012. While we have
limited historical visibility into how faithfully ISPs applied this
blocklist, we can analyze its evolution to understand what the
government intended to block through the years.
Our collaboration with activists in Russia also helped us
gain access to a diverse set of vantage points in the country,
where even renting from reliable Russian virtual private server
(VPS) providers requires Russian currency and an in-country
phone number and address. From these vantage points, we
can perform measurements to provide a clearer picture of
Russia’s decentralized control—what is blocked, how it is
blocked, and how much variation there is from one ISP to
another. We performed measurements from within Russia from
20 different vantage points provided to us by volunteer activists,
following established ethical practices to reduce risk [19],
[77], [91]. We augment the data collected in Russia with two
remote measurements tools—Quack and Satellite [9], [58],
[78]—expanding our measurements to over a thousand vantage
points within Russia and enabling us to validate our local
measurements.
From our experiments, we observe that even though
not all ISPs block content in similar ways, the volume of
websites blocked within residential ISPs is uniformly high.
Indicating that coordinated information control in countries
with decentralized networks is entirely possible; debunking our
initial hypothesis. However, the method by which censorship
if effected is largely dependent on their network providers;
we observe TCP-layer blocking, application-layer blocking
facilitated by deep packet inspection, and DNS manipulation,
or a combination of these methods. We also observed that
residential ISPs are more likely to inject explicit blockpages,
which cite the law and/or Roskomnadzor’s registry as they are
encouraged to do so by Roskomnadzor’s guidelines.
We also observe a difference in quantity and method of
blocking between the two network perspectives—residential
networks and data center networks. This corroborates the
insight that in most countries, residential ISPs are subject to
different laws and policies for information control. Therefore,
an accurate representative view of censorship is achievable only
with measurements from a diverse set of vantage points.
The growth of decentralized information control can lead
to different ISPs implementing censorship differently, which
may contribute to the fragmentation of access to online content
for users—even for neighbors who happen to subscribe to
different providers. In countries such as China that practice
relatively monolithic censorship, circumvention developers
can optimize and test tools for use anywhere in the country,
and both marketing and word-of-mouth can help users ﬁnd
these effective countermeasures. But in countries such as
Russia, decentralized information control adds another layer
of complexity: a circumvention tool that works for one user
may not work for others. We hope that by highlighting this
new trend of moving away from ﬁltering at government-run
technical choke points towards legally mandated censorship
enforced by private ISPs, we can help inform thinking and
future work on other countries pursuing more authoritarian
network controls.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Early censorship research focused on countries with more
centralized information controls, such as China and Iran [4],
[31]. However, new measurement techniques and in-depth
studies of countries such as India and Pakistan [54], [89]
have observed a move towards a decentralized approach to
information control, through both technical and political means.
Technical advancements are making it easier for regimes to
restrict their citizens’ freedoms even in countries without a
history of centralized restrictive controls. Russia is a prime
exemplar of this trend, and we fear that Russia will provide a
model that other less-centralized countries can adapt. In this
section, we delineate centralized and decentralized control,
discuss past censorship research, and delve into how Russian
censorship embodies an alarming trend, all of which helps guide
our understanding of the mechanisms that enable increased
decentralized control.
Centralized control:
Previous work has shown that cen-
sorship within China and Iran follows a very centralized
information control scheme [4], [31], [44], [88]. This is made
possible by their strict control over the network infrastructure
within their respective countries. Countries with centralized
control over their network can control information in a highly
scalable way, and small perturbations to network reachability
can have dramatic effects throughout the country. An example
of this is the case in which North Korea’s only ISP lost its link
with China Unicom, cutting off Internet access in the whole
country [59]. Censors like this tend to apply an even mix of
censorship methods across the entire networking stack. For
instance, China blocks Google’s public DNS resolver (8.8.8.8)
at the IP layer, Tor relays at the TCP layer [22], poisons many
DNS queries [3], [42], and blocks sensitive search terms in
HTTP trafﬁc ﬂows [13].
The qualities of Russia’s information controls are not
restricted to Russia. As Yadav et al. note, India is already
attempting to implement a similar censorship regime [89]. The
Decentralized control: More recently, several countries
around the world have been deploying decentralized information
control schemes. These countries do not possess control of
2
their networks in the same way as Iran and China do. Rather,
their networks mostly consist of autonomously controlled
segments owned by commercial or transit ISPs, whose goals
may not align with a government regime attempting to restrict
information access. Lack of direct ownership by government
authorities lowers their ability to unilaterally roll out technical
censorship measures, and instead enact controls via law and
policy, compelling the network owners to comply. We see
control like this in countries such as India [89], Indonesia [29],
and the United Kingdom [2], as well as Russia. In each
of these cases, governments pass laws requiring ISPs to
block content, and ISPs use a variety of disparate censorship
methods to achieve this. For instance, Indonesian ISPs heavily
rely on DNS manipulation [29], while Indian ISPs use a
combination of DNS manipulation, HTTP ﬁltering, and TCP/IP
blocking [89]. These factors cause us to worry that restricting
the freedom of citizens is now attainable for many countries,
and, even worse, that decentralized information control is more
difﬁcult to measure systematically and circumvent. Measuring
it requires multiple vantage points within the country and
multiple detection techniques to provide coverage of ISP
blocking policies. Decentralized control also acts as a barrier
to circumvention as it makes it difﬁcult for users to discover
locally effective tools.
A. Understanding Censorship Studies
We highlight the common challenges and considerations
that drive design decisions in the censorship ﬁeld, as well as
the overview of extant censorship measurement studies and
techniques. In this background section, we aim to illustrate
how decentralized information control makes it more difﬁcult
to discover and characterize censorship.
the physical
1) Censorship Techniques: On a technical level, network
censorship is deﬁned as the deliberate disruption of Internet
communication. At
layer, a simple form of
disruption is to simply “unplug the cable”, cutting off all
network connectivity. This extreme action has happened on
several occasions in a handful of countries. Shutdowns generally
are easier to implement for ISPs, but also provoke backlash
from customers and impact their business. A recent analysis
showed that such disruptions affected 10 countries in sub-
Saharan Africa over a combined period of 236 days since 2015,
at a cost of at least $235 million [14]. Most studies, including
this one, focus on several protocols above the physical layer
which are common targets for censorship, we expand on them
below and explain common methods of interference, protocol
and packet features that trigger the censor, and the censor
action.
• Method: TCP/IP Blocking; Trigger: IP address; Action: Filter
request or response—The censor can disrupt communication
to individual services or hosts by blacklisting their IP
addresses [1]. This is a particularly common, effective, and
cheap way to block access to a server hosting undesired
content. It can cause signiﬁcant collateral damage for
innocuous sites that happen to be hosted at the same IP
address as a blocked site, e.g. blocking of content delivery
networks’ (CDN) point of presence [11]. This method has
historically been used in countries such as Iran and China
to block circumvention proxies such as Tor relays [4], [22].
• Method: DNS Manipulation; Trigger: Hostname; Action:
Filter or modify response—The censor can observe DNS
queries or responses containing a sensitive hostname, decide
to either fabricate responses that return DNS error codes
such as “host not found”, non-routable IP addresses, or
the address of a server that likely hosts a blockpage. A
blockpage is deﬁned as a notice that explains to the user
why the content is unavailable. DNS manipulation enables
ﬁne-grained ﬁltering, because simply poisoning the cache
of a DNS resolver can be circumvented by using alternate
DNS resolvers such as Google’s (8.8.8.8).
• Method: Keyword Based Blocking; Trigger: Keyword, Host-
name; Action: Filter or inject—The censor can inspect
and understand the content of the HTTP(S) packets to
determine whether it contains censored keywords. The
trigger may also be sensitive content in the response or
the request other than the hostname. If triggered, it can
either drop packets, or inject TCP RSTs or a blockpage.
Implementing this form of blocking is challenging, as
inspecting trafﬁc at line rate is quite resource-intensive. Naive
implementations are trivially defeated; for example, Yadav
et al. [89] discovered that merely capitalizing keywords that
the censor was looking for entirely circumvented application
layer blocking. Some protocols such as HTTPS also defeat
naive implementations of application-layer blocking, but
more sophisticated blockers may man-in-the-middle each
connection and strip the encryption or block based on ﬁnding
the trigger in the SNI (Server Name Indication) which is
transferred in plaintext.
We want to acknowledge that this is a brief overview of
the common methods of censorship, and with advancements in
