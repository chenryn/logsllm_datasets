Hello,  
PowerToys Run was working.  
I didnâ€™t use it because it has not yet entered my usual reflexes.  
Now that I want to use it actively, it doesn't work.  
I type Alt + Space and it pulls down the File menu of the active window.  
I tried with other keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't work.  
Do you know this problem?  
Do you know the solution?  
Thank you for your attention.
