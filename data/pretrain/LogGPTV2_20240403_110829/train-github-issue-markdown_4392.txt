Hello,

I recently had PowerToys Run installed and functioning correctly. However, I did not use it frequently as it had not yet become a part of my regular workflow. Now that I am ready to use it more actively, I have encountered an issue where it no longer works as expected.

When I press the Alt + Space key combination, it opens the File menu of the active window instead of launching PowerToys Run. I have also tried using other keyboard shortcuts, but none of them work either.

Has anyone else experienced this problem? If so, do you know how to resolve it?

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
