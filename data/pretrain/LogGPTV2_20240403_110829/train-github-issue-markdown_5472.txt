**Issue Description:**
We are applying label selectors to a federated service, but the changes are not being propagated to all clusters. The controller manager does not report any updates to the service.

**Service YAML:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: date-time-federated
spec:
  selector:
    name: update-demo
    version: black
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The federated service should be updated across all clusters with the new label selectors. However, the controller manager reports no changes to the service. When we print the service YAML from the federation, it contains the new label selectors, but the service YAML directly from the clusters' APIs shows no updates.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Set `--v=5` on the federation controller manager.
2. Create a federated service.
3. Add some label selectors to the service and apply it through the federation.
4. Watch the federation controller manager logs while applying the new label selectors.
5. Observe the logs that indicate there is no update because there are no perceived changes to the service.

**Additional Information:**
- The controller manager is only evaluating the ports for changes to the service. See the 1.4.0 reference and the master reference.
- We expect the update criteria to be broader than just changes to ports, as our use case involves deployment update strategies like adding a canary under the service.
