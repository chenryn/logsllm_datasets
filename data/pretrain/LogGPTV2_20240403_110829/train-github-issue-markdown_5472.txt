**What happened** :  
We are applying label selectors to a service that is federated. e.g.,
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: date-time-federated
    spec:
      selector:
        name: update-demo
        version: black
      ports:
        -
          protocol: TCP
          port: 8080
          targetPort: 8080
      type: LoadBalancer
**What you expected to happen** :  
We expect the federated service to be updated on all clusters. Instead, the
controller manager reports no changes to the service.
When we print the service YAML from the federation, it contains the new label
selectors. When we print the service YAML directly from the clusters' APIs
(who are members of the federation) there are no updates to the service
whatsoever.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
Set `--v=5` on the federation controller manager. Create a federated service.
Add some label selectors to the service and apply it through the federation.
Watch the federation controller manager logs while applying the new label
selectors and observe the logs that indicate there is no update because there
are no perceived changes to the service.
**Anything else do we need to know** :  
We see that the controller manager is only evaluating the ports for changes to
the service. See the 1.4.0 reference and the master reference.
Do we have the correct expectation that update criteria should be broader than
just changes to ports?
Our use case is for deployment update strategies like sticking a canary under
the service.
Thanks a bunch!
