User: I'm trying to read command line arguments in python in the form:
python myprogram.py string string string
I have tried using sys.argv[1-3] to get each string, but when I have a string such as $unny-Day, it does not process the entire string. How can I process strings like these entirely?
Assistant: Are you using a shell? $ is a special character in the shell that is interpreted as a shell variable. Since the variable does not exist, it is textually substituted with an empty string.
Try using single quotes around your parameter, like > python myapp.py '$unny-Day'.
