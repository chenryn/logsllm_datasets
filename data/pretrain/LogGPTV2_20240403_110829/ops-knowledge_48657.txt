The provided system log, spanning from 2015-07-30 15:13:49 to 17:58:23, captures the activity of a ZooKeeper server. Here is a step-by-step summary and analysis of the log entries:

1. **Session Establishment and Connection Requests:**
   - At 15:13:49, a client at IP /10.10.34.13:54387 attempts to establish a new session.
   - At 15:13:54, a session with ID 0x34ed9ac1c1e0064 is established for the client at /10.10.34.11:37111, with a negotiated timeout of 10000 milliseconds.
   - Multiple connection requests from older clients (at 15:14:15, 16:34:25, and 16:34:35) are noted, and it is mentioned that these connections will be dropped if the server is in read-only (r-o) mode.

2. **Socket Connections:**
   - The NIOServerCnxnFactory accepts socket connections from various clients:
     - At 15:32:23, from /10.10.34.11:37330.
     - At 16:21:27, from /10.10.34.12:59323.
     - At 17:11:56, from /10.10.34.12:59359.
     - At 17:22:36, from /10.10.34.13:54649.
     - At 17:34:50, from /10.10.34.11:41732.
     - At 17:58:23, from /10.10.34.13:50180.

3. **Socket Closures:**
   - The NIOServerCnxn closes socket connections for several clients:
     - At 16:18:14, for /10.10.34.18:46783 with session ID 0x34ed9ac1c1e0086.
     - At 16:18:36, for /10.10.34.11:40581 with session ID 0x34ed9ac1c1e0093.
     - At 16:36:05, for /10.10.34.11:41160 with session ID 0x34ed9ac1c1e00a9.

4. **Warnings and Exceptions:**
   - At 16:21:13 and 17:36:52, the NIOServerCnxn catches end-of-stream exceptions, indicating potential issues with data transmission.
   - At 17:40:45, the QuorumCnxManager$RecvWorker logs a warning about a broken connection for ID 1, with the server's ID being 3.

5. **Quorum and Leader Election:**
   - At 17:57:38, the QuorumPeer enters the LOOKING state, indicating it is searching for a leader.
   - At 17:57:38, the FastLeaderElection process provides a notification, showing the current state as FOLLOWING, with details on the leader, zxid, round, and other relevant information.
   - At 17:49:01, a session with ID 0x34ed9ac1c1e00d1 is established for the client at /10.10.34.11:49255, with a negotiated timeout of 10000 milliseconds.

In summary, the log captures the dynamic interactions between the ZooKeeper server and its clients, including session establishment, socket connections, and disconnections, along with warnings and the quorum's leader election process.
