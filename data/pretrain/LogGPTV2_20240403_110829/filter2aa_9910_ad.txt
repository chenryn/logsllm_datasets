The sender tried to transmit the letter `a` 11 times. Each time, different bits were dropped. We'll represent dropped bits with `x` (for some transmissions, it's possible to place the missed bit(s) in several different places - we'll show only one possible placement).

    while ti < len(target) and si < len(sample):
        if target[ti] == sample[si]:
            ti += 1
