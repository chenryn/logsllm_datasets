time by capping the ﬁngerprint (see Figure 5 ). We calibrate
all the labeled ﬁngerprints based on the victim’s ﬁngerprint.
We consider nine labeled ﬁngerprints per ﬁngerprinted path
and evaluate for 100 iterations each time picking labeled and
victim’s ﬁngerprints randomly.
Figure 15 depicts the identiﬁcation accuracy for data usage
varying from 100% (i.e., a maximum of nine transmitting
cells) to 30% data usage (i.e., a maximum of three transmitting
cells). This yields an overall accuracy greater than 50% when
the victim’s data usage requires at least 70% of the conﬁgured
secondary cells to be activated. However, it decreases further
to only 24.2% for lesser data usage. Hence, we can conclude
that SLIC is most effective when the victim’s data usage is
The CA side-channel we discover in this paper is fundamental
scheduling metadata of cellular system and thus an end-user
cannot remove it without the support from the operator, or,
better yet, some changes in the standard. We begin with one
countermeasure that removes the side channel completely
with the modiﬁcation to the standard. We then discuss how
the operators can mitigate the attack without changing the
standard. We also discuss some cell deployment suggestions
for 5G networks.
9.1 Encrypting Side-Channel Information
This countermeasure makes the secondary cell activation in-
formation conﬁdential to any unauthorized parties by encrypt-
ing it. In the protocol stack, the resource scheduling is done
by the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer which is below
the Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer that is re-
sponsible for encryption. Implementing the encryption of the
bitmap, thus, requires signiﬁcant changes in the protocol stack.
Particularly, the MAC layer must be incorporated with the
encryption mechanism to protect the scheduling information.
In addition, this change may require a new symmetric key be-
tween every UE and the primary cell, which involves changes
to the existing key management schemes [2] as it is generally
advisable to have separate keys for different purposes.
9.2 Readily-Available Countermeasures
We propose two highly effective countermeasures that require
no changes to the standards.
Adding noise to the side channel. This countermeasure ex-
ploits the standard operation to make the side channel noisier,
rendering the SLIC less effective. According to the speciﬁca-
tion (see Section 6.1.3.8 in 3GPP TS 36.321 [5]), a device
should ignore the activation of any secondary cells that are
not in the list of the conﬁgured secondary cells. When some
indices in the bitmap are used for the conﬁgured cells, the pri-
mary cell can activate any of the unused indices to add noise
to the side channel. These additional indices are ignored by
the device and thus have no effect on the scheduling of the
system; yet, these intentionally added indices are wrongly
considered as activated cells by an adversary.
Note that the amount of added noise may be limited based
on the number of conﬁgured secondary cells. If a large number
3910    30th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
(e.g., close to 31) of secondary cells is already conﬁgured,
then the primary cell can add only a small number of noise
secondary cells.
Changing device identiﬁers frequently. As we explain in
our threat model (§3), SLIC requires linking the real-world
identity to the network identity of the devices (i.e., TMSI).
A number of attacks, such as Shaik et al. [3] or Rupprecht et
al. [40], have demonstrated that such mapping of identities in
different layers is possible in 4G networks. As a countermea-
sure, thus, operators can change the TMSIs frequently (e.g.,
every connection request), making the mapping difﬁcult in
practice. Note, however, that care must be taken when design-
ing and implementing reallocation of TMSIs as new TMSIs
can be traceable with new attack strategies; see how one can
link the changing TMSIs in the 5G network with the recent
attack by Hussain et al. [24].
9.3 SLIC-Aware Cell Planning
Proper cell planning is necessary when deploying or upgrad-
ing cellular networks. Operators decide numerous high-level
system parameters during cell planning, including the basic
cell layouts [41], frequency allocations [42, 43], inter-cell
interference management [44], etc., to achieve several oper-
ational goals [45]: improving radio coverage, maximizing
resource utilization, optimizing the system capacity, etc.
A SLIC-aware cell planning considers the risk of path iden-
tiﬁcation from the early stage of cell deployment. What we
report in this paper is that high variance in the path ﬁnger-
prints makes the path-identiﬁcation attacks highly effective.
The SLIC-aware cell planning would minimize the variance
in the number of nearby cells at different locations, render-
ing the SLIC highly ineffective. 5G is still at its infancy and,
thus, this new SLIC-aware planning goal can be considered
for the upcoming network deployment. Also, 5G is expected
to be much more heterogeneous (e.g., millimeter waves, sub-
6-GHz spectrum, unlicensed bands) than 4G networks and
this heterogeneity would make the SLIC-aware cell planning
optimization more viable. We leave this as future work.
10 Related Work
Location-privacy attacks exploiting cellular networks.
Recent studies demonstrated that adversaries may be able to
infer the location of targeted individuals and their traces [3, 4].
The closest work to SLIC is proposed by Michalevsky et al. [4]
called PowerSpy attack that exploits the fact that mobile de-
vices experience similar power changes when traveling on the
same driving path due to the static cellular tower locations.
While PowerSpy and SLIC both utilize side-channel infor-
mation from the cellular network to infer the user’s location,
they differ signiﬁcantly in the following two aspects. First,
PowerSpy requires installing malware on the victim devices,
which increases the attack cost. SLIC inherently does not have
such requirements as it can simply capture the victim’s infor-
mation by passively monitoring the cellular network. Second,
PowerSpy infers driving paths, while SLIC identiﬁes more
ﬁne-grained walking paths, even distinguishing across differ-
ent indoor paths.
Similarly, Shaik et al. [3] demonstrate that in LTE, an ad-
versary can determine whether a target user is in the same cell
by probing the targeted user’s applications or through silent
voice calls. Yet, the attack can only infer whether a target
is within the primary cell whereas SLIC can achieve much
ﬁne-grained location information.
IMSI catchers [46] can be also used to track cellular users
at the cell granularity after the international mobile subscriber
identity (IMSI) of a target user is learned via a fake base
station. In contrast, SLIC does not require any fake base station
and achieves much ﬁner-grained location inference.
Location-privacy attacks exploiting sensors. Researchers
proposed side-channel attacks exploiting sensors on a smart-
phone to infer the victim’s location. Han et al. proposes AC-
Complice which utilizes a smartphone’s accelerometer to infer
the victim’s driving routes as well as its starting point [47].
Narain et al. extends the work to also incorporate gyroscope
and magnetometer sensors and correctly identify driving paths
across 11 cities [48]. Ho et al. relies solely on the barometer
of a smartphone to track a car’s driving route [49]. However,
all of these works requires installing malware on the victim’s
phone. SLIC inherently removes such constraint, rendering its
attack more stealthy.
11 Conclusion
Mobile phone location is undoubtedly highly sensitive in-
formation. Our society has reached a strong consensus that
phone location data must be handled with extreme care; see
the heated discussion regarding contact tracing in the midst
of a pandemic. SLIC demonstrates that such highly sensitive
phone location information can be leaked to an unauthorized
adversary stealthily through benign-looking scheduling meta-
data in any modern cellular networks. Worse yet, the risk
of location information leakage is only expected to grow as
cellular networks utilize more frequency spectrum with small
cells using heterogeneous physical-layer technologies.

A Design and Implementation of Wi-Fi-to-5G
Evaluation Framework
We ﬁrst explain the three stages in the Wi-Fi-5G evaluation
framework that applies the selection algorithm on the Wi-Fi
measurements to obtain the number of conﬁgured secondary
cells (§A.1). Then, we describe the secondary cell selection
algorithm as given in the speciﬁcation (§A.2) followed by its
implementation (§A.3).
A.1 Design of Wi-Fi-to-5G Evaluation Frame-
work
Figure 8 depicts the three stages in Wi-Fi-to-5G evaluation
framework.
➊ Converting Wi-Fi signals to 5G signals. Even though Wi-
Fi and 5G LAA secondary cells share many physical-layer
characteristics, there still exist some minor differences that
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    3913
need to be taken into account. For example, we measure the
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value of the Wi-
Fi signals whereas the cellular system measures Reference
Signal Receive Power (RSRP) [50], which is a more ﬁne-
grained measurement than RSSI. These measurements are
made on the beacons or reference signals (i.e., discovery ref-
erence signal) transmitted by the Wi-Fi AP and primary cell
respectively. However, the periodicity of the transmission of
beacons and reference signals is different. On one hand, Wi-Fi
transmits beacons approximately every 100 milliseconds [51],
whereas the reference signals can be sent every 40/80/120
milliseconds [36]. The limited periodicity of reference signals
in Wi-Fi systems leads to coarse-grain measurement. This
may degrade the quality of the side-channel information and
thus offers the lower-bound performance for SLIC.
➋ Implementing the secondary cell conﬁguration algo-
rithms. Unlike 4.5G/5G networks, only a single access point
(AP) is assigned to a user at a time in Wi-Fi. To obtain the
set of conﬁgured secondary cells that can be aggregated for
concurrent downlink transmission, we execute the secondary
cell conﬁguration algorithms in the speciﬁcation (Section
5.5.4 in TS 36.331 [15]). The algorithm has the following
steps: (1) A primary cell assigns an initial set of secondary
cell conﬁguration algorithms and its parameters when a UE
ﬁrst connects to it; (2) the UE measures the secondary cells
based on the parameters set in (1) and sends the measurement
reports based on the conﬁguration algorithms; (3) Based on
the report, the primary cell takes the determined actions, such
as selecting a new secondary cell, and informs the UE along
with the updated set of algorithms if required; (4) Repeat
(2)–(3).
➌ Determining activated secondary cells. In this ﬁnal stage
of the evaluation framework, we determine the activated sec-
ondary cells based on the user’s downlink demand. All the
conﬁgured secondary cells will be activated if there is a back-
log in the UE’s downlink. However, if a user’s downlink
demand is limited the cellular network will activate a fewer
number of secondary cells.
A.2 Secondary Cell Selection Algorithm
We reproduce the secondary cell selection algorithm to em-
ulate the behavior observed in traces captured from the real
network. The primary cell selects the secondary cells for each
user based on the data it receives from the UE. To receive
this data, the primary cell ﬁrst informs the UE about the con-
ﬁguration parameters such as type of measurements, report-
ing period, conﬁguration parameters, list of frequencies, etc.,
which are required by the cell selection algorithm [15]. The
UE sends measurement reports consisting of radio quality of
cells often indicated by RSRP or Reference Signal Received
Quality (RSRQ) values. The primary cell uses these reports to
select an optimal set of secondary cells, which together with
the primary cell form the serving cells.
What to measure. There are two broad categories of radio
quality measurements performed by the UE:
1) Serving and intra-frequency measurements where the UE
measures the serving cells and the neighbouring cells in
the same frequency as the serving cells. These neighbour-
ing cells are called intra-frequency neighbouring cells.
2) Inter-frequency measurements where the UE measures
cells in frequencies conﬁgured by the primary cell but not
present in the current serving cell frequencies. These cells
are known as inter-frequency neighbouring cells. The UE
measures the inter-frequency neighbouring cells during a
measurement gap conﬁgured by the primary cell. During
this gap, no transmission or reception is scheduled. This
enables the UE to switch to different bands and obtain the
signal quality of cells in these bands.
When to send the report. The measurement reports can be
sent either periodically or when a condition is triggered. We
notice from our captured network traces that the majority
of the reports are sent only when a condition is triggered.
