### Time by Capping the Fingerprint

We calibrate all labeled fingerprints based on the victim’s fingerprint. For each fingerprinted path, we consider nine labeled fingerprints and evaluate them over 100 iterations, randomly selecting labeled and victim’s fingerprints each time.

Figure 15 illustrates the identification accuracy for varying data usage, from 100% (i.e., a maximum of nine transmitting cells) to 30% data usage (i.e., a maximum of three transmitting cells). The results show an overall accuracy greater than 50% when the victim’s data usage requires at least 70% of the configured secondary cells to be activated. However, the accuracy decreases to only 24.2% for lower data usage. Thus, SLIC is most effective when the victim’s data usage is high.

### CA Side-Channel Discovery

The CA side-channel discovered in this paper is rooted in fundamental scheduling metadata of cellular systems, making it impossible for end-users to remove without operator support or changes to the standard. We first propose a countermeasure that completely eliminates the side channel through modifications to the standard. We then discuss how operators can mitigate the attack without changing the standard. Additionally, we provide cell deployment suggestions for 5G networks.

#### 9.1 Encrypting Side-Channel Information

This countermeasure ensures the confidentiality of secondary cell activation information by encrypting it. In the protocol stack, resource scheduling is managed by the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, which is below the Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer responsible for encryption. Encrypting the bitmap thus requires significant changes in the protocol stack. Specifically, the MAC layer must be integrated with an encryption mechanism to protect the scheduling information. This change may also require a new symmetric key between every UE and the primary cell, necessitating updates to existing key management schemes [2], as it is generally advisable to use separate keys for different purposes.

#### 9.2 Readily-Available Countermeasures

We propose two highly effective countermeasures that do not require changes to the standards:

**Adding Noise to the Side Channel:**
This countermeasure exploits standard operations to make the side channel noisier, reducing the effectiveness of SLIC. According to the specification (see Section 6.1.3.8 in 3GPP TS 36.321 [5]), a device should ignore the activation of any secondary cells not in the list of configured secondary cells. When some indices in the bitmap are used for configured cells, the primary cell can activate any unused indices to add noise to the side channel. These additional indices are ignored by the device and have no effect on system scheduling; however, they are incorrectly considered as activated cells by an adversary.

Note that the amount of added noise may be limited by the number of configured secondary cells. If a large number (e.g., close to 31) of secondary cells is already configured, the primary cell can add only a small number of noise secondary cells.

**Frequent Changes to Device Identifiers:**
As explained in our threat model (§3), SLIC requires linking the real-world identity to the network identity of devices (i.e., TMSI). Several attacks, such as those by Shaik et al. [3] and Rupprecht et al. [40], have demonstrated that such mapping of identities in different layers is possible in 4G networks. As a countermeasure, operators can frequently change TMSIs (e.g., every connection request), making the mapping difficult in practice. However, care must be taken in designing and implementing TMSI reallocation, as new TMSIs can still be traceable with new attack strategies, as shown by Hussain et al. [24].

#### 9.3 SLIC-Aware Cell Planning

Proper cell planning is essential when deploying or upgrading cellular networks. Operators decide numerous high-level system parameters during cell planning, including basic cell layouts [41], frequency allocations [42, 43], inter-cell interference management [44], etc., to achieve operational goals such as improving radio coverage, maximizing resource utilization, and optimizing system capacity.

SLIC-aware cell planning considers the risk of path identification from the early stages of cell deployment. Our findings indicate that high variance in path fingerprints makes path-identification attacks highly effective. SLIC-aware cell planning would minimize the variance in the number of nearby cells at different locations, rendering SLIC ineffective. Since 5G is still in its infancy, this new planning goal can be considered for upcoming network deployments. Additionally, the expected heterogeneity of 5G (e.g., millimeter waves, sub-6-GHz spectrum, unlicensed bands) compared to 4G networks makes SLIC-aware cell planning more viable. This is left for future work.

### 10 Related Work

**Location-Privacy Attacks Exploiting Cellular Networks:**
Recent studies have shown that adversaries can infer the location and traces of targeted individuals using cellular networks [3, 4]. The closest work to SLIC is the PowerSpy attack by Michalevsky et al. [4], which exploits power changes in mobile devices traveling on the same driving path due to static cellular tower locations. While both PowerSpy and SLIC use side-channel information from the cellular network, they differ in two key aspects: PowerSpy requires malware installation, increasing the attack cost, whereas SLIC does not. Additionally, PowerSpy infers driving paths, while SLIC identifies fine-grained walking paths, even distinguishing indoor paths.

Shaik et al. [3] demonstrate that in LTE, an adversary can determine whether a target user is in the same cell by probing the targeted user’s applications or through silent voice calls. However, this attack can only infer whether a target is within the primary cell, whereas SLIC provides much finer-grained location information.

IMSI catchers [46] can track cellular users at the cell granularity after learning the IMSI of a target user via a fake base station. In contrast, SLIC does not require a fake base station and achieves finer-grained location inference.

**Location-Privacy Attacks Exploiting Sensors:**
Researchers have proposed side-channel attacks exploiting smartphone sensors to infer the victim’s location. Han et al. [47] proposed ACComplice, which uses a smartphone’s accelerometer to infer driving routes and starting points. Narain et al. [48] extended this work to include gyroscope and magnetometer sensors, correctly identifying driving paths across 11 cities. Ho et al. [49] relied solely on a smartphone’s barometer to track a car’s driving route. However, these works require installing malware on the victim’s phone, which SLIC inherently avoids, making the attack more stealthy.

### 11 Conclusion

Mobile phone location is highly sensitive information. Our society has reached a strong consensus that phone location data must be handled with extreme care, as seen in discussions about contact tracing during a pandemic. SLIC demonstrates that such sensitive information can be leaked to unauthorized adversaries through benign-looking scheduling metadata in modern cellular networks. The risk of location information leakage is expected to grow as cellular networks utilize more frequency spectrum with small cells using heterogeneous physical-layer technologies.

### A Design and Implementation of Wi-Fi-to-5G Evaluation Framework

We first explain the three stages in the Wi-Fi-5G evaluation framework that applies the selection algorithm on the Wi-Fi measurements to obtain the number of configured secondary cells (§A.1). Then, we describe the secondary cell selection algorithm as given in the specification (§A.2) followed by its implementation (§A.3).

#### A.1 Design of Wi-Fi-to-5G Evaluation Framework

Figure 8 depicts the three stages in the Wi-Fi-to-5G evaluation framework.

1. **Converting Wi-Fi signals to 5G signals:**
   Even though Wi-Fi and 5G LAA secondary cells share many physical-layer characteristics, there are minor differences that need to be accounted for. For example, we measure the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value of the Wi-Fi signals, while the cellular system measures Reference Signal Receive Power (RSRP) [50], which is a more fine-grained measurement. These measurements are made on the beacons or reference signals (i.e., discovery reference signal) transmitted by the Wi-Fi AP and primary cell, respectively. However, the periodicity of the transmission of beacons and reference signals differs. Wi-Fi transmits beacons approximately every 100 milliseconds [51], whereas reference signals can be sent every 40/80/120 milliseconds [36]. The limited periodicity of reference signals in Wi-Fi systems leads to coarse-grain measurement, potentially degrading the quality of the side-channel information and offering a lower-bound performance for SLIC.

2. **Implementing the secondary cell configuration algorithms:**
   Unlike 4.5G/5G networks, only a single access point (AP) is assigned to a user at a time in Wi-Fi. To obtain the set of configured secondary cells that can be aggregated for concurrent downlink transmission, we execute the secondary cell configuration algorithms in the specification (Section 5.5.4 in TS 36.331 [15]). The algorithm involves the following steps:
   - A primary cell assigns an initial set of secondary cell configuration algorithms and their parameters when a UE first connects to it.
   - The UE measures the secondary cells based on the parameters set and sends measurement reports based on the configuration algorithms.
   - Based on the report, the primary cell takes determined actions, such as selecting a new secondary cell, and informs the UE along with the updated set of algorithms if required.
   - Repeat the above steps.

3. **Determining activated secondary cells:**
   In this final stage of the evaluation framework, we determine the activated secondary cells based on the user’s downlink demand. All configured secondary cells will be activated if there is a backlog in the UE’s downlink. However, if the user’s downlink demand is limited, the cellular network will activate fewer secondary cells.

#### A.2 Secondary Cell Selection Algorithm

We reproduce the secondary cell selection algorithm to emulate the behavior observed in traces captured from the real network. The primary cell selects the secondary cells for each user based on the data it receives from the UE. To receive this data, the primary cell first informs the UE about the configuration parameters such as type of measurements, reporting period, configuration parameters, list of frequencies, etc., which are required by the cell selection algorithm [15]. The UE sends measurement reports consisting of radio quality of cells often indicated by RSRP or Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) values. The primary cell uses these reports to select an optimal set of secondary cells, which together with the primary cell form the serving cells.

**What to Measure:**
There are two broad categories of radio quality measurements performed by the UE:
1. **Serving and intra-frequency measurements:**
   The UE measures the serving cells and neighboring cells in the same frequency as the serving cells. These neighboring cells are called intra-frequency neighboring cells.
2. **Inter-frequency measurements:**
   The UE measures cells in frequencies configured by the primary cell but not present in the current serving cell frequencies. These cells are known as inter-frequency neighboring cells. The UE measures the inter-frequency neighboring cells during a measurement gap configured by the primary cell. During this gap, no transmission or reception is scheduled, allowing the UE to switch to different bands and obtain the signal quality of cells in these bands.

**When to Send the Report:**
Measurement reports can be sent either periodically or when a condition is triggered. Our captured network traces show that the majority of the reports are sent only when a condition is triggered.
