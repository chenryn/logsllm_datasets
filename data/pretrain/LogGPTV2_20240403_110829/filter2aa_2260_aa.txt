### Executive Summary

The tactical interoperable communications scorecard evaluates the maturity of tactical interoperable communications capabilities in 75 urban/metropolitan areas. These scorecards were developed by subject matter expert panels, which reviewed documentation on current communications plans, exercises, and self-assessments to reach consensus findings and recommendations for each region. The scorecards and their recommendations are being distributed directly to each urban/metropolitan area to focus regional efforts on improving tactical interoperable communications. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using these scorecards to guide technical assistance programs and target specific areas for improvement in communications interoperability.

Overall, the scorecard results indicate that urban/metropolitan areas have made significant progress in enhancing their tactical interoperable communications capabilities. However, as documented in the SAFECOM National Baseline Assessment, while the technology exists to enable interoperable communications, solutions are often not available regionally and are far from seamless in many areas. Continued training on available technical solutions and procedures for their use is critical for operational success. Even in areas with demonstrated success at the tactical, command-level of communications interoperability, there is still work to be done. Multi-agency communications have been addressed within many jurisdictions, but regionalizing existing communications strategies to identify longer-term interoperability goals across multiple jurisdictions and levels of government remains a challenge.

The scorecard evaluation focuses on three key elements of the SAFECOM Interoperability Continuum: Governance, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and Usage. Preliminary findings include:

- **Governance:** Areas with mature governance structures have advanced further in implementing shared systems/solutions that facilitate regional communications. Regionalized strategic plans are largely not in place and should be developed for communications interoperability, with careful consideration for how investments can be shared across the region.
- **SOPs:** For many urban areas, the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plans (TICPs) developed through the Interoperable Communications Technical Assistance Program (ICTAP) provided the first formal, regionwide communications interoperability SOPs. Additional steps should be taken to ensure these procedures, as well as those outlined in the National Incident Management System, are fully instituted at the command and responder levels.
- **Usage:** Proficiency in the use of communications interoperability equipment and accompanying procedures varies by the types of equipment used and becomes increasingly complex as additional agencies are included in response efforts. Almost no region had completed a communications-focused exercise before the TICP validation exercise, meaning these areas had no specific practice using their interoperable communications capabilities.

A more comprehensive analysis of the scorecards will be developed during the second quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2007 to support the scorecards provided to the urban/metropolitan areas and to outline additional trends in the data. With this information, DHS will continue to align its programs and resources to best address the communications needs of first responders.

**Note:**
- Urban areas are those previously defined under the FY 2005 Homeland Security Grant Program.
- Metropolitan areas were not part of UASI but were selected by each state to participate in the Office of Grants and Training TICP process.

### Introduction

The Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard represents the first measurement of the maturity of communications interoperability in urban/metropolitan areas across the nation. The results show that these areas have made significant progress in developing their tactical interoperable communications capabilities. As reiterated in the SAFECOM National Baseline Assessment, while the technology exists to permit interoperable communications, solutions are often not available regionally and are far from seamless in many areas. The scorecards confirm this fact and highlight the need for continued training on available technical solutions and their usage procedures, which is critical for operational success. In areas that have demonstrated success at the tactical, command-level of communications interoperability, there is still work to be done. The scorecard process has highlighted how multi-agency communications have been addressed within many jurisdictions, but regionalizing existing communications strategies to identify longer-term interoperability goals across multiple jurisdictions and levels of government should be addressed.

### The Need for a Scorecard

The tactical interoperable communications scorecard effort fulfills a pledge made by DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff to provide each urban area with a scorecard, as announced at the Tactical Interoperable Communications Conference in May 2006. To fulfill this pledge, the DHS Office of Grants and Training (G&T), in consultation with SAFECOM and the Wireless Management Office (WMO), developed a scorecard that assesses the maturity of tactical interoperable communications capabilities in 75 urban/metropolitan areas.

The scorecard provides an assessment of the progress each urban/metropolitan area has individually achieved in tactical interoperable communications across three elements of the SAFECOM Interoperability Continuum: Governance, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and Usage. The scorecard also offers recommendations on how to improve an urban/metropolitan area’s capabilities in the immediate future using existing technologies.

**Note:**
- Tactical interoperability in this context does not address events resulting in catastrophic failure or loss of equipment within the urban/metropolitan area.
- Urban areas are those previously defined under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI). Metropolitan areas were not part of UASI but were selected by each state to participate in the G&T Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan process.

### Scorecard Creation

Each scorecard is composed of three main sections:
1. **Summary:** Provides a map of the urban/metropolitan area, summary results, and a description of the jurisdictions that comprise the area.
2. **Findings:** Includes details on the successes and challenges faced by the urban/metropolitan area, followed by recommendations for the area to consider when taking steps to improve its interoperable communications capabilities.
3. **Technology Overview:** Summarizes the communications systems and technologies used in the urban/metropolitan area to achieve interoperability.

In Appendices A and B, the scorecard results are organized by urban, metropolitan, and territory areas. The detailed scorecards are provided directly to representatives of the urban/metropolitan areas.

The scorecard is based on the SAFECOM Interoperability Continuum and the National Interoperability Baseline Survey, which assessed the capacity for communications interoperability among law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services (EMS) first responders in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Three of the five Continuum elements were measured: Governance, SOPs, and Usage.

### Achieving Communications Interoperability with Existing Technology

The results of the National Baseline Assessment conducted by the SAFECOM Program show that most agencies have at least a minimum technological capability to achieve tactical interoperable communications. Whether through mature, shared systems or simply through swapped radios, the technology that many agencies possess is not the primary issue hampering communications interoperability. Each urban/metropolitan area has different technology solutions because achieving interoperability depends on the existing types of communications equipment and infrastructures each agency employs. Therefore, the voice communications solution that would be considered ideal in one area could be unsuited for another. As the interdependencies of the Interoperability Continuum illustrate, it is the ability to use technology during incident response that allows an area to have improved tactical interoperable communications.

Therefore, while the recommendations section of the scorecard will address an urban/metropolitan area's technology gaps identified by the review panel, it also focuses on how best to improve tactical interoperable communications with that area’s existing technologies.

### Maturity Levels of Tactical Interoperable Communications

The scorecard employs a capabilities maturation model with four stages:
1. **Early Implementation**
2. **Intermediate Implementation**
3. **Established Implementation**
4. **Advanced Implementation**

Each stage is defined by specific criteria and indicators, providing a clear framework for assessing and improving the maturity of tactical interoperable communications capabilities.
