Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY    
The tactical interoperable communications scorecard assesses the maturity of tactical 
interoperable communications capabilities in 75 urban/metropolitan1 areas.  These scorecards 
were developed by subject matter expert panels that reviewed documentation on current 
communications plans, exercises, and a self-assessment to arrive at consensus findings and 
recommendations for each region on how to best improve that region’s communications 
capabilities.  These scorecards and the recommendations included are being distributed directly to 
each of the urban/metropolitan areas to focus their regional efforts to improve tactical interoperable 
communications.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using these scorecards to focus 
technical assistance programs and target specific areas of improvement in communications 
interoperability. 
Overall, the scorecard results show that urban/metropolitan areas have come a long way in 
improving their tactical interoperable communications capabilities.  As documented in the 
SAFECOM National Baseline Assessment, the technology exists to permit interoperable 
communications, but solutions are often not available regionally and are far from seamless in many 
areas.  Continued training on available technical solutions and procedures for their use is critical to 
operational success.  Even in areas that have demonstrated success at the tactical, command-
level of communications interoperability, there is still work to be done.  Multi-agency 
communications have been addressed within many of these jurisdictions, but regionalizing the 
existing communications strategies to identify longer term interoperability goals across multiple 
jurisdictions and levels of government still needs to be addressed.     
The scorecard evalution specifically focuses on Governance, Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOP), and Usage elements of the SAFECOM Interoperability Continuum.  Preliminary findings for 
these areas include— 
Governance—Areas with mature governance structures have advanced further in implementing 
shared systems/solutions that facilitate regional communications.  Regionalized strategic plans are 
largely not in place and should be developed for communications interoperability with careful 
consideration for how investments can be shared across the region. 
SOPs—For many of the urban areas, the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plans (TICP) 
developed through the Interoperable Communications Technical Assistance Program (ICTAP) 
provided the first formal, regionwide communications interoperability SOPs.  Additional steps 
should be taken to ensure that these procedures (as well as those outlined in the National Incident 
Management System) are fully instituted at the command and responder levels. 
Usage—The proficiency in the use of communications interoperability equipment and 
accompanying procedures varies by the types of equipment used and is increasingly complex as 
additional agencies are included in response efforts.  In addition, almost no region had completed 
a communications-focused exercise before the TICP validation exercise, which meant that the 
areas had no specific practice using their interoperable communications capabilities. 
A more comprehensive analysis of the scorecards will be developed during the second quarter of 
fiscal year (FY) 2007 to support the scorecards provided to the urban/metropolitan areas and to 
outline additional trends in the data and scorecards.  With this information, DHS will continue to 
align its programs and resources to best address the communications needs of first responders.     
1 Urban areas are those areas that were previously defined under the FY 2005 Homeland Security Grant Program.  Metropolitan areas 
were not part of UASI but were selected by each state to participate in the Office of Grants and Training TICP process.

INTRODUCTION    
The Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard represents the first measurement of the 
maturity of communications interoperability in urban/metropolitan areas across the Nation.  The 
results show that urban/metropolitan areas have come a long way in developing their tactical 
interoperable communications capabilities.  As reiterated in the SAFECOM National Baseline 
Assessment, technology exists to permit interoperable communications, but solutions are often not 
available regionally and are far from seamless in many areas.  The scorecards confirm this fact 
and show that continued training on available technical solutions and their procedures for use is 
critical to operational success.  In areas that have demonstrated success at the tactical, command-
level of communications interoperability, there is still work to be done.  The scorecard process 
highlighted how multi-agency communications has been addressed within many jurisdictions, but 
regionalizing the existing communications strategies to identify longer term interoperability goals 
across multiple jurisdictions and levels of government should be addressed.

The tactical interoperable communications2 scorecard 
effort executes a pledge to provide each urban area with 
a scorecard made by Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) Secretary Michael Chertoff, while speaking to the 
attendees at the Tactical Interoperable Communications 
Conference in May 2006.  To fulfill this pledge, the DHS 
Office of Grants and Training (G&T), in consultation with 
SAFECOM and the Wireless Management Office (WMO), 
developed a scorecard that assesses the maturity of 
tactical interoperable communications capabilities in 75 
urban/metropolitan3 areas.   
The scorecard provides an assessment of the progress each 
urban/metropolitan area has individually achieved with its 
available means of tactical interoperable communications 
across three elements (Governance, Standard Operating 
Procedures [SOP], Usage) of the SAFECOM Interoperability 
Continuum.  The scorecard also provides recommendations 
on how to best improve an urban/metropolitan area’s 
capabilities 
in 
the 
immediate 
future 
using 
existing 
technologies.

Each scorecard is composed of three main sections.  The first section, the Summary, provides a 
map of the urban/metropolitan area, summary results, and a description of the jurisdictions that 
comprise the area.  The second section, the Findings, includes details on the successes and 
challenges faced by the urban/metropolitan area, followed by recommendations for the area to 
2 Note that tactical interoperability in this context does not address events that result in catastrophic failure or loss of equipment 
within the urban/metropolitan area. 
3 Urban areas are those areas that were previously defined under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI).  Metropolitan areas were 
not part of UASI, but were selected by each state to participate in the G&T Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan process.

communications is defined as the 
rapid provision of on-scene, incident-
based, mission-critical voice 
communications among all first 
responder agencies (i.e., emergency 
medical services [EMS], fire, and law 
enforcement), as appropriate for the 
incident.   
“By the end of this year, each urban 
area is going to get a scorecard… that 
will identify gaps and help us to 
determine the improvements we need 
to make in the near term.”

Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards 
consider when taking steps to improve its interoperable communications capabilities.  The final 
section, Technology Overview, summarizes the communications systems and technologies used in 
the urban/metropolitan area to achieve interoperability.  In Appendices A and B, the scorecard 
results are organized by urban, metropolitan, and territory areas.  The detailed scorecards are 
provided directly to representatives of the urban/metropolitan areas.  
The scorecard is based on the SAFECOM Interoperability Continuum and the National 
Interoperability Baseline Survey4 Interoperability Maturity Measurement Model.  Three of the five 
Continuum elements were measured: Governance, SOPs, and Usage.    
4 This survey assessed the capacity for communications interoperability among law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical 
services (EMS) first responders in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
Area Overview  
This section defines the 
geographic region included in 
the urban/metropolitan area for 
the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Initiative. 
Category and Score  
The assessment is broken into three 
sections: SOPs, Usage, and Governance 
(based on the SAFECOM Continuum).  For 
each, a “Harvey Ball” score is shown. 
Findings  
Each category includes a 
paragraph explaining the 
reasoning behind the assigned 
score.  Findings are based on 
reviewed materials, including:  
Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP), 
TICP Peer review, TICP 
Validation Exercise (Evaluation 
Guide [EEG] and After Action 
Report [AAR]/Improvement Plan 
[IP]), and Self Assessment 
discussion. 
Technology Overview  
While infrastructure was not 
specifically assessed, an 
overview of existing solutions 
in the region, which were the 
basis for the TICP and TICP 
Validation Exercise, is 
provided. 
Recommendations  
Steps are listed to be 
considered in fiscal year (FY) 
2007 to enhance 
communications 
interoperability in the region.

Achieving Communications Interoperability with Existing Technology    
The results of the National Baseline Assessment conducted by the SAFECOM Program show that most agencies 
have at least a minimum technological capability to achieve tactical interoperable communications.  Whether 
through mature, shared systems or simply through swapped radios, the technology that many agencies possess 
is not the primary issue hampering communications interoperability.  Moreover, each urban/metropolitan area 
has different technology solutions because achieving interoperability is dependent on the existing types of 
communications equipment and infrastructures each agency employs.  Therefore, the voice communications 
solution that would be considered ideal in one area could be unsuited for another.  As the interdependencies of 
the Interoperability Continuum illustrate, it is the ability to use technology during incident response that allows 
an area to have improved tactical interoperable communications.    
Therefore, while the recommendations section of the scorecard will address an urban/metropolitan area's 
technology gaps identified by the review panel, it also focuses on how best to improve tactical interoperable 
communications with that area’s existing technologies.
