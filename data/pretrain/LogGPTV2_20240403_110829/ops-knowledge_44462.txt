User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Skip new Windows 7 user selection and go to login prompt We've begun our migration to windows 7 and we ran into an interesting issue. When we hit "CTRL+ALT+DEL" we are brought to the "User selection Screen". Normally, this screen will have an icon for every local user for the machine. These machines are Domain members with "Fast User Switch" disabled so no user names are listed only the "Other User" option. If you click "Other User" or hit enter, the system moves on to the normal login screen where it prompts for user name and password.

Here's the issue: We want to find a way to skip over the part where a user selects "Other User". We essentially want the system to always assume that we always want "Other User" and to go directly to the login screen when a user hits "CTRL+ALT+DEL".

What I find odd is that the "Other User" doesn't show up until we've had more than one domain user log in. Right after we re-image the machine, the login process goes directly to the user credential prompt.

[EDIT]

Security Policies set by Active Directory:


Interactive logon: Do not display last user name = Enabled
Interactive login: Do not require CTRL + ALT + DEL = Disabled


[End Edit]

Anyone have any ideas?

Assistant: Apply following GPO's:
Group Policy Management

Create or select the "Default Domain Policy", Edit

Once the 'Group Policy Management Editor' is opened, make 4 modifications

Computer Config - Policies - Window Settings - Security Options - 'Interactive Login: Do not display last user name' = Enable

Computer Config - Policies - Window Settings - Security Options - 'Interactive Login: Do not require Ctrl+Atl+Del' = Disable

Then

Computer Config - Policies - Administrative Templates - Logon - 'Hide entery points for Fast User Switching' - Enable

Computer Config - Policies - Administrative Templates - Logon - 'Always use classic logon' - Enabled - Enable
