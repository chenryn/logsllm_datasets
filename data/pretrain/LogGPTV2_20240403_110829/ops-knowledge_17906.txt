Question: In reviewing the security controls of a web application, you notice that the application locks out accounts after three failed authentication attempts. Which of the following is a valid criticism of this defense mechanism?
"A": "Such a mechanism effectively prevents brute-force attacks by limiting the number of guesses an attacker can make.",
"B": "This control may lead to denial of service for legitimate users if an attacker deliberately fails authentication attempts.",
"C": "Locking accounts increases the complexity of the system, thus reducing overall security.",
"D": "The mechanism is ineffective because brute-force attacks are no longer a common threat vector."
Answer: B
