### Code Implementation
```python
# Load the KMeans model
km = joblib.load(filename)

# Predict cluster labels for the input data
cluster_labels = km.predict(X)

# Compute the average silhouette score
silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(X, cluster_labels)

# Compute the silhouette scores for each sample
sample_silhouette_values = silhouette_samples(X, cluster_labels)
```

### Model Training Details
The `km` model was trained using the following parameters:
```python
km = KMeans(n_clusters=num_k, init='k-means++', max_iter=300, n_init=1, verbose=False)
km.fit(X)
```

### Issue Description
When the number of rows in `X` is less than 30,000, both `silhouette_score` and `silhouette_samples` functions work as expected. However, when the number of rows exceeds 100,000, the program crashes with a "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" error.

### Error Details
Here is the detailed traceback of the error:

This error indicates that there is an issue with memory management or data structure integrity when handling large datasets. To resolve this, consider the following steps:
1. Ensure that the dataset `X` is not too sparse.
2. Check for any memory leaks or excessive memory usage.
3. Consider using a more efficient data structure or a different method to compute the silhouette scores for large datasets.
