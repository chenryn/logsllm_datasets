**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Account Management

To mitigate the risks associated with user account management, organizations should adhere to the principle of least privilege. This involves:

- **Limiting Administrative Privileges:** Restrict the number of users within the organization who have IAM roles with administrative privileges.
- **Reducing Permanent Privileged Roles:** Strive to minimize the assignment of permanent privileged roles to users.
- **Conducting Periodic Entitlement Reviews:** Regularly review and audit IAM users, roles, and policies to ensure that access rights are appropriate and up-to-date.

By implementing these practices, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
