When using the `Http` class for API calls in Angular, you may encounter an issue with the `Observable.map()` function. This problem arises because RxJS operators, such as `map`, are not included by default in the Angular project. To resolve this, you need to manually import the necessary operators from RxJS.

For example, if you are trying to use the `map` function in a call like `http.get(...).map(...)`, and it is not working, it is likely due to the missing import. This issue has also been noted in versions up to Angular alpha 48.

To fix this, ensure that you import the `map` operator from RxJS at the top of your file:

```typescript
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```typescript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

// Inside your service or component
this.http.get('your-api-url').pipe(
  map(response => {
    // Your transformation logic here
  })
).subscribe(data => {
  // Handle the transformed data
});
```

By following these steps, you should be able to use the `map` operator without any issues.
