#### Overview
When executing SQL scripts using `ResourceDatabasePopulator` or
`JdbcTestUtils` errors may occur if there are block comments in the file. In
general multi-line comments using the `/* ... */` syntax are not explicitly
supported.
#### Notes
Proper support for standard SQL comments (i.e., any text beginning with two
hyphens and extending to the end of the line) was introduced in #14616 and
#14708. However, neither `ResourceDatabasePopulator` nor `JdbcTestUtils`
contains _explicit_ support for multi-line SQL comments.
#### Deliverables
  1. Extract common functionality related to script parsing from `ResourceDatabasePopulator` and `JdbcTestUtils` into a new `public` component or utility in the `org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.init` package in the `spring-jdbc` module.
  2. Support multi-line SQL comments in the component extracted in the previous deliverable.
  3. Make the start and end delimiters for block comments configurable.
