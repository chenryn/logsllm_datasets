User: Please explain what idempotence is, why it is important in API design, and provide an example to illustrate.
Assistant: Idempotency means that when the same operation is executed repeatedly, the result is still the same without errors or side effects. In API design, idempotency is very important, because it can ensure the correctness and consistency of the system, reduce the risk of repeated operations, and also improve the reliability and scalability of the system. A simple example is a bank transfer operation. Suppose we want to transfer 100 yuan to a friend now, we initiate an HTTP POST request to send the details of the transfer to the server. If we don't consider idempotence, then this request may be executed multiple times due to network delays or other conditions. This will cause the friend to receive multiple transfers, and the balance will also be wrong. However, if we guarantee idempotency, no matter how many times the request is executed, the friend will only receive one transfer, and the balance will not cause an error. This is the importance of idempotence in API design.
