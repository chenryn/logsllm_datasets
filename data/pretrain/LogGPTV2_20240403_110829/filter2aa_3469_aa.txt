Abstract
The St. Regis ShenZhen, a gorgeous luxury hotel occupying the top 28 ﬂoors of a 100
story skyscraper, o↵ers guests a unique feature: a room remote control in the form of an
iPad2.
The iPad2 controls the lighting, temperature, music, do not disturb light, TV,
even the blinds and other miscellaneous room actions. However, the deployment of the
home automation protocol contained several fatal ﬂaws that allowed an arbitrary attacker
to control virtually every appliance in the hotel remotely. I discovered these ﬂaws and,
as a result, was able to create the ultimate remote control. The attacker does not even
need to be in the hotel - he could be in another country. This white paper discusses home
automation and the anatomy of the attack: an explanation of reverse engineering of the
KNX/IP home automation protocol; a description of the deployment ﬂaws; blueprints on
how to create an iPad Trojan to send commands outside the hotel; and, of course, solutions
to avoid all these pitfalls in future deployments.

Introduction
In Hollywood movies, cyberattacks end with shocking results that stun the audiences and
ruin the movie for security researchers. Traﬃc halts in LA as Seth Green switches all lights
to red in the Italian Job. The bad guy in Jurassic Park shuts down the electrical fences and
the dinosaurs roam free. These epic attacks sound whimsical, but nowadays appear closer
than ever with the advent of what people call the Internet of Things (IoT), a vision where
every single electronic device is networked.

Figure 1: The view
But if there was any doubt, imagine this scene in a James Bond movie. The bad guy
and his minions guard the bomb detonator in a hotel suite. Time is running out, and Bond
cannot access the room and ﬁght the guards. All seems lost. Suddenly, his cell rings, and
after grabbing it he hears Qs desperate voice (the techie guy). “Why are you so worried
James?” says Q in an arrogant tone “In 20 seconds I will provide you with the distraction
needed to do your job”. James hangs up in disbelief, cursing the kid (in the past Q looked
like a revered old scientist, now he looks like a startup billionaire). Suddenly, every light
and TV in the hotel starts ﬂickering. The drapes go up and down erratically and deafening
music roars from every room. All the guests start ﬂeeing in panic and the guards are no
exception. James aims the gun at them from a safe distance, muttering “Rats, I need to
learn Python”.
No way, you will say. No one can take over a building in this fashion. Not even the super
smart guy from the movie. Fear not, this paper presents a real scenario, and for added
theatrical charm the location could not be any more perfect: a beautiful ﬁve-star hotel in
China, absolutely worthy of a James Bond ﬁlm.
But before going into the gory technical details, let’s ﬁrst discuss why we are here:
because the situation described in this work is by no means unique, and more hotels and
2
residential buildings will follow suit.
This work is not intended as a critique of the security decisions of the property itself.
The targeted hotel performed due diligence after being notiﬁed of the problem, and being
a trailblazer in a new and upcoming technology always has drawbacks. This work intends
to be a cautionary tale so that future implementations avoid the pitfalls that would allow
the chance for this epic movie scene to come to life.

Home Automation
In commercial buildings, the automation of electronic components (HVAC, lighting) has
been around for a long time. Commercial building automation systems need to know just a
little about the owner. Sensors are suﬃcient for learning the usage patterns of the building
and the environment circumstances. Home automation (or residential building automation),
while technically similar, had an erratic component that until today was diﬃcult to track,
understand and communicate with: the person living at the home.
Home automation
is user centric, and hence it also includes other items not usually present in commercial
buildings, in particular, entertaining appliances such as music, TV and little pet robots (in
my personal case). The usage patterns for entertainment depend heavily on the user and
hence are hard to predict.
The advent of new technologies such as predictive learning, and most importantly, the red
hot IoT provides a path to better automate your home by having all electronics networked
to you and your desires. You may compare home automation to your TV remote, just on
steroids, and with better knowledge than you about which channel to watch. To exemplify,
by deploying home automation technology you may be able to light up the house when you
enter, change TV channels through your phone, get toasts when your stomach grumbles
and even have a drone deliver fresh bread every morning at say, 8 AM (on Sundays at 10
AM).
The astute reader (who also may yell “you kids get of my lawn!” most often than not)
will protest and state that the beloved home toaster is sacred and will never be networked.
But few doubts exist that home automation is already present and here to stay, with its
deployment and utilization rising dramatically. According to Reuters [1] home automation
is a $1.5 billion business and expected to rise to remarkable estimated $2.5 billions by year
2015. Leaving behind our craving for economic statistics to demonstrate every point, home
automation is overdue: we possess the technology to make our lives way comﬁer, and home
automation will signiﬁcantly reduce the energy footprint in everyone’s daily life. Machines
love the earth way more than we do - we program them when we are in our best spirits.
That is rarely the case when we ﬁnally reach home after a couple of beers and make it to
3
bed leaving the lights and TV on, with the remote falling out of our hand and mother earth
being just a loving ﬁgure in our dreams.
3.1
Security in Home Automation
Home automation will make our lives more comfortable, help the environment, and in the
long run provide signiﬁcant savings reﬂecting the decrease of energy consumption. However,
home automation presents challenges as it requires a set of technological elements to be
orchestrated together. For the end provider, it is a little bit like making a burger: everyone
understands what the end result should be, but the ingredients vary signiﬁcantly from one
home deployment to the other. And that lack of standardization is always a ﬁeld day for
attackers out there.
Hence, to the home automation party an uninvited guest, security, arrives - there is
always one.
And is not an easy one to handle.
The mighty struggle between usability
versus protection seldom appears more acute than in home automation. The user requires
simplicity (a PIN to operate my toaster? What is this, Fort Knox?), while the evil guy next
door stands ready to create havoc by performing an orchestrated toaster uprising.
Second, it requires all the complicated components to be (at least partially) networked
wirelessly, and possibly accessed from outside the home. In the past, building automation
was performed by wired buses. These buses, initially proprietary, were slowly standard-
ized in several protocols. As always, each continent chose its own darling (e.g., KNX in
Europe), but they provide similar features. These protocols aided enormously in creating
an ecosystem to buy and sell new appliances to network electronics without having to be
bound to a single vendor. However, they did not add security (meaning authentication and
encryption) as a part of the standard. After all, the scenario was totally di↵erent when they
were created, with the building itself protecting the access to wired networked elements.
A new standard was developed for wireless commercial building automation with strong
security: Zigbee. However, WiFi for home networking is as extended as it gets, so legacy
standards are still able to thrive under that umbrella.
If you already deployed home automation at your place, it probably works like this: you
utilize a panel or your phone to connect to a router, and the router connects to the device.
The connection, if it is your home, is done wirelessly from the panel, and the other devices
are wired to a digital actuator. You can also connect directly to the device if it is a new
appliance such a smartTV or an internet camera, utilizing an API that it presents to the
world. For example, if you have some sort of streaming dongle such as the ROKUTM the
application in your phone sends HTTP requests to the included RESTful API presented
by the device. This API is available to any developer, so anyone can scan the network for
4
a ROKU and contact it using any application out there or the one home-brewed. There is
no security in this process, as that will force the user to add some sort of authentication
token and that is a hassle for most scenarios. To control devices that are a little more
backwards, say, a bulb, blinds, old TVs or temperature, you need to ﬁrst connect them to
a home automation hub, and that hub will connect to the panel.
So where is the security? The cybersecurity of home automation in a vast majority of
cases is in your wireless key, usually WPA2. Obviously, if someone gets a hold of your
WPA2 key, they can go ahead and take control of your home, but it is a fair assumption
that if the key is suﬃciently strong it will take some time for that to happen.
3.2
Hotel Room Automation
Hotels are unique in that they combine requirements from both commercial and residential
spaces.
Adding home automation to guest rooms as an added amenity provides hefty
incentives for hotels. Everything that applies to a single user, applies to every room in
the hotel: cost savings, guest satisfaction and increased utilization of amenities. Bundling
the room control with other o↵erings, such as in-room dining or movie selection, seems to
increase overall spending by the guest in the room, at least according to Intelity [2], a hotel
automation vendor.
Hotels time-share the rooms and everything in them (lights, TV, HVACs, entertainment
units), so they fall into the tragedy of the commons when it comes to energy usage. Most
guests care little about leaving the light on at a hotel. While attempts have been made to
correct the problem, such as forcing you to “switch on” the room by placing your card in
a receptacle (ever come back to your room to pick up that phone you left charging, just to
realize it is still dead?), home automation is a far better answer.
Customer comfort increases dramatically by utilizing centralized room controls too.
When you arrive to a hotel room, you don’t know what appliances you can switch on.
Is there music? TV channels? Where is that light switch? All that guess work is over if you
can automatically discover every switchable element in the room just by looking an in-room
IPAD, or better still, an application in your own iPhone or iPad.

KNX
According to their webpage, KNX is “the world’s only open Standard for the control in
both commercial and residential buildings”. It goes on by saying “KNX is therefore future
proof” [3]. The reality is that KNX is as open as the VIP section in a Las Vegas club:
it is open as long as you pay (a lot) to get in. For the second claim, in the advent of
5
wireless communications and transparency, it may at least be aging. All the information in
this section is publicly available or inferred from open source code, as public access to the
speciﬁcations does not exist.
KNX is a widely deployed bus communication standard. It is the successor of the EIB/In-
stantbus European Standard, developed in the early 1990s. The St. Regis chose KNX to
perform home automation, possibly because it is a Chinese Standard (GB/T 20965). The
core protocol provides details to connect actuators to appliances. To get on with the new
funky times we live in, KNX may be encapsulated inside an IP packet and sent over medi-
ums such as wireless or the internet, and this version is called KNX/IP [4]. A KNX/IP
frame is a connectionless datagram (UDP) envelope for a payload named cEMI in the KNX
standard. The payload carried the protocol commands for connection, and, what is more
important for an attacker, the end message to the KNX backbone (see Fig. 2).

The protocol provides several commands and modes of operation, for both communi-
cation with the end devices and for conﬁguration. The KNX/IP mode utilized at the St.
Regis was “Tunnel” mode, where a KNX/IP router tunnels KNX message requests from the
IP backbone to the KNX network. The notation for KNX addresses is in the form A/B/C.
It works in a similar fashion as IP addresses. The ﬁrst and second digits deﬁne subnets, and
the last digit deﬁnes the actual address of the element in the subnet. For example 1/2/3
represents a device with an address of 3, on 1/2 subnet.
The cEMI frame, among other ﬁelds, contains the address of the sender, the address
of the receiver, the command type and command payload, which may or may not exist
depending on the command type. For the interested, one of the few (free) available KNX
open documents describes the data types of the payload [5].
To send a message, the protocol performs a simple sequential handshake (every message
is followed by an ACK or fail message from the router). The handshake ﬁrst starts the com-
munication by sending two datagrams in order. The ﬁrst is a CONNECTION REQUEST.
