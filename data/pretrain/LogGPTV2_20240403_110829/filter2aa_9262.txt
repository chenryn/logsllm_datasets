# Package

## Description
> A package has arrived, come take it!
An executable file was attached.
## Solution
Let's start by running the executable:
```console
E:\CTFs\kaf\Package>Package.exe
Hello, you have a package in the mail!
Please enter your details, inorder to take the package
Enter your name : test_name
Enter your password: test_pass
THIS IS NOT YOUR PACKAGE!!!
```
Looks like we need to find the correct username/password.
Let's inspect the binary:
```console
user@CTF_PC:/mnt/e/CTFs/kaf/Package$ file Package.exe
Package.exe: PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, UPX compressed
```
This binary is compressed with [UPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPX), we should extract it before trying to analyze it:
```console
user@CTF_PC:/mnt/e/CTFs/kaf/Package$ upx -d Package.exe -oUnpackedPackage.exe
