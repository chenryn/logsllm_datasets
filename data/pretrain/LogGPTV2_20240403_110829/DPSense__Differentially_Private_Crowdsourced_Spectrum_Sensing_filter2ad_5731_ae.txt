6.4 PIM Trace Generation
We evaluate the impact on PIM traces generation by adapting 
values. Since the scheme in [27] is adopted to generate the PIM
traces, we refer interested readers to [27] for detailed analysis and
evaluations. Per our simulations, we ﬁnd that δ cannot be too large
or too small. With a large δ, locations with small prior probabilities
are likely to be excluded in the δ-location set, ΔX. This is good in
keeping a reasonable size of ΔX. However, it might fail to track
location updates as well. On the other hand, with a small δ, more
locations with small prior probabilities are likely to be included in
ΔX. This might lead to a large ΔX (over 40 or more) and result
in failure of correctly tracking the true location. Here, we choose
δ = 0.02 to achieve a good trade-off. We will present the impact
of δ on our system performance later in Section 6.9.
We ﬁrst extract one random participant and visually examine the
PIM trace generated in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 with different . It is ob-
vious that  = 2 generates a PIM trace closer to the original trace,

δ
which indicates small location errors. This is further conﬁrmed in
Fig. 9a and Fig. 9d. In these two ﬁgures, we compare the distance
between the original trace and the PIM trace for every timestam-
p. It is clear that when  is 1, the distance sometimes can be very
high (e.g., over 5 km). When  increases to 2, the max distance
error is around 3.5 km, which is a huge improvement. We further
apply the sliding window in Fig. 9b and Fig. 9e. We can see that
the sliding window is very effective in reducing the distance errors.
For example, when  is 1, the max distance error is reduced from
5.1 km to 3.2 km. The average distance error is greatly reduced as
well. Reducing the distance error can greatly beneﬁt TCR because
the SSP has more accurate knowledge about the participants’ loca-
tions. Lastly, we compare the size of ΔX in Fig. 9c and Fig. 9f.
We can see that the ΔX size when  is 1 is larger than that when 
is 2. This is expected since with a larger , the mechanism is sup-
posed to track the true location better. We will further evaluate the
relationship between ΔX size and  later.
6.5 Effectiveness of Sliding Window
Fig. 10a shows the impact of μ on the total travel distance (TTD).
We can see that a larger μ generally results in a smaller TTD. We
note that when μ is 1, which corresponds to the case where no
smoothing is conducted, with the sliding window in place, TTD
has been reduced from 67 km to 48 km, a 28.3% reduction. On
the other hand, TTD slows down the reduction when μ is over 5.
However, there is still a gap between our scheme and the baseline
scheme. This is the expected utility trade-off when incorporating
privacy protection. We also show the worst case for comparison.
Recall that the worst case is deﬁned as the case that no participant
declines the assigned subtask. In other words, SSP simply assigns
the sensing task to participants who are the closest to the sensing
locations. We see that there is a gap between the worst case and the
PIM trace curve. Fig. 10b shows the TCR performance. Here, we
see that the TCR is dramatically improved from 0.7 to 0.9. Still,
TCR slows increasing when μ passes 5. Generally, the larger μ is,
the better performance we can achieve in both TTD and TCR. On
the other hand, larger μ means higher computation complexity.
6.6
Impact of Number of Participants
Fig. 10c shows the impact of N on TTD. Generally, the larger
N is, the smaller TTD is. This is true for both schemes. Fig. 10d
shows the TCR performance. Clearly, more participants can lead
to higher task-completion rates. We show the comparison with the
baseline scheme using the original trace as well. We see that even
without the noise added to the traces, TCR is close to 0.93. It means
that some tasks, though with very small probability, might still fail
to meet the diversity requirement because the sensing locations are
too remote to the majority of participants.
6.7
Impact of Number of Sensing Tasks
Fig. 10e shows the impact of M on TTD. As expected, the dis-
tance increases with the number of sensing tasks although the in-
crease is limited. Fig. 10f shows that TCR decreases with M. Since
more tasks are generated, SSP might have to select participants far
away to perform the tasks, which leads to a higher assignment de-
cline rate. In addition, since some tasks might be generated in areas
with low population of participants, these tasks might fail as well.
6.8
Impact of 
We change the value of  in our simulations and evaluate the
impact on the performance. Fig. 10g shows the results of TTD.
We see that with  increasing, TTD decreases. This indicates that a
larger  can generate more precise mobility traces that are close to
the original ones. We also observe from Fig. 10h that TCR in our
scheme is almost identical to that in the baseline approach when  is
4. In addition, we show the average ΔX size in Fig. 11. We can see
that the number of candidate locations drops from approximately
6.9 to approximately 3.9 with the increase of . This matches our
expectation well. When  is small, the scheme generates larger
noise to the participants’ mobility traces, hence a larger ΔX. This
indicates a better location privacy protection as well due to more
candidate locations. Correspondingly, it will be more difﬁcult for
the attacker to infer the participants’ true locations.
6.9
Impact of δ
δ also has a similar impact on the system performance to ,
though we ﬁnd the system is more sensitive to it. Fig. 10i shows
the TTD results with different δ values. We can see that there is a
relatively big decrement when δ increases from 0.01 to 0.02, and
the curve is becoming ﬂat when δ is over 0.02. So this could in-
dicate 0.02 is a good choice of δ for our system. Correspondingly,
TCR also generally increases when δ increases but the gain is most
observable when we increase δ from 0.01 to 0.02. Recall that a
larger δ means a smaller δ-location set and hence worse location
privacy. On the other hand, a larger δ can generate mobility traces
closer to the original traces, leading to smaller distance errors. We
then show the average ΔX size in Fig. 12. It can be observed that
the ΔX size is very sensitive to the δ value. The size drops dra-
matically from 15.3 to 4.4 when δ increases from 0.01 to 0.03. To
ensure sufﬁcient location privacy, we ﬁnd that δ = 0.02 can be a
good choice for our system.
6.10
Impact of α
We vary the value of α, the distance weight ratio between the
waiting-time equivalent distance and the true travel distance in our
proposed synthetic travel distance model as in Eq. 5. Fig. 10k and
Fig. 10l show the results of TTD and TCR, respectively. We can
observe that the increase in α only contributes to a small increase
in both TTD and TCR. This indicates that our system is consistent
with all the distance models that practical systems might have. In
addition, the value of α might directly relate to the payment to each
305participant. A smaller value of α could indicate smaller payments
because less weight is assigned to the waiting-time equivalent dis-
tance. Since we do not propose additional payment schemes in our
framework, we omit further analysis in this regard.
6.11
Impact of β
In some cases, it is strictly required that the desired sensing di-
versity be achieved to completely avoid any potential transmission
interference to PUs. β is such a system parameter that enables the
system to adjust the priority. Fig. 10m and Fig. 10n show the sim-
ulation results of TTD and TCR, respectively. Speciﬁcally, we see
that a larger β leads to an increased TTD value. This is intuitive
because a larger β value usually indicates that some sensing tasks
are over-fulﬁlled, i.e., more than a desired number of participants
are selected to perform the sensing tasks. The beneﬁt of a larger
β is also clearly shown in Fig. 10n where we can see that TCR is
almost 1 when β is 1.4 and 1 when β is 1.6.
In other words, a
larger β ensures that all sensing tasks can be fulﬁlled with enough
participants to guarantee sufﬁcient spatial sensing diversity. It is
also worth noting that when β is 1, those tasks that are not ful-
ﬁlled are usually located remotely to most participants. In practice,
the SSP can thus dynamically determine the value of β for each
sensing task based on the practical demographic properties of the
areas where the sensing tasks are located. This strategy ensures
that the majority of sensing tasks can be fulﬁlled and at the same
time manages to reduce the unnecessary TTD (or cost) that could
be incurred.

Impact of div

Fig. 10o shows the results of TTD. Clearly, with a larger div
participants are likely to be selected to fulﬁll the sensing tasks, thus
resulting in a dramatic increase in TTD. Fig. 10p shows the change
of TCR. We see that a higher diversity order is very demanding,
generating a larger negative impact on TCR in contrast to the results
from varying M in Fig. 10e. Speciﬁcally, the decrease of TCR is
found in both the baseline scheme and our scheme.

7. RELATED WORK
In this section, we discuss some prior work that is most germane
to DPSense.
There is a rich literature on location privacy in general frame-
works, for which a nice review for location privacy-preserving mech-
anisms (LPPMs) can be found in [16]. In addition, a formal frame-
work for the analysis of LPPMs is proposed in [22].
Signiﬁcant efforts have also been made to protect location pri-
vacy in CSS systems [10, 15, 17, 25]. This line of work aims at
preventing location privacy leakage from sensing reports submitted
by crowdsourced sensing users. We proposed a privacy-preserving
crowdsourced spectrum sensing framework in [15] that can simul-
taneously achieve three design objectives: differential location pri-
vacy, approximate social cost minimization, and truthfulness. The
spectrum service provider is assumed to be fully trusted in [15]. In
contrast, here we assume that the SSP is honest-but-curious and we
address a very different problem in this paper.
Another line of work aims to address location privacy leakage
in general crowdsourced mobile sensing systems [19, 23]. To et
al. [23] proposed a framework to protect location privacy of work-
ers during the task assignment phase. Different from [23], DPSense
does not need the trusted service provider as in their work to perfor-
m the sanitized database release and geocast of spatial crowdsourc-
ing tasks. In addition, DPSense targets a totally different applica-
tion scenario in which spectrum-sensing tasks have strict sensing
time requirements. Pournajaf et al. [19] considerd spatial task as-
signment for crowd sensing with cloaked locations. Different from
this work, DPSense considers completely different system model-
s and involves the time constraint of the sensing tasks. The task
scheduling and the probabilistic model for participants to accep-
t/decline sensing tasks makes it challenging or impossible to adapt
the scheme [19] to our application scenario.
In addition, there is a surge of interest on task assignment in s-
patial crowdsourcing [4, 5, 13]. He et al. [13] seek to maximize the
rewards of the platform with consideration of geographic locations
and time budgets of mobile users. But they did not consider maxi-
mizing the task fulﬁllment ratio, which is a critical design objective
in the context of CSS. Cheng et al. [4] aim to maximize both the
spatial and temporal diversity of spatial crowdsourcing tasks but do
not consider the minimization of travel distances. Deng et al. are
the ﬁrst to study the combination of task assignment and scheduling
in spatial crowdsourcing [5], but their work differs from DPSense
in two main aspects. First, the task assignment in [5] is based on
known participants’ locations and does not provide any location
privacy guarantee. Second, the tasks in their model have deadlines
such that participants can perform the tasks any time before the
deadline. This is different in our scenario where spectrum-sensing
tasks have strict requirement on the sensing time. Hence, it is non-
trivial to directly extend these existing efforts to the context of CSS.
Differential privacy [7, 18] has emerged as a powerful tool to
provide statistical guarantee of the data privacy with the trade-off
of the data utility. Xiao et al. in [27] found that the well known
l1 norm sensitivity fails to capture the geometric sensitivity in the
two dimensional space and proposed a planar isotropic mechanism
for the location perturbation, which is the ﬁrst to achieve the lower
bound of differential privacy in the speciﬁc application scenario.
8. CONCLUSIONS
Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has great potential to address
worldwide spectrum shortage by enhancing spectrum efﬁciency.
As a key enabler for DSA systems, crowdsourced spectrum sensing
(CSS) allows a spectrum sensing provider (SSP) to outsource the
sensing of spectrum occupancy to distributed mobile users. In this
paper, we proposed DPSense, a novel framework that allows the
SSP to select mobile users for executing spatiotemporal spectrum-
sensing tasks without violating the location privacy of mobile users.
Detailed evaluations on real location traces conﬁrmed that DPSense
can provide differential location privacy to mobile users while en-
suring that the SSP can accomplish spectrum-sensing tasks with
overwhelming probability and also the minimal cost.
