### 6.4 PIM Trace Generation
We evaluate the impact of varying \(\delta\) values on the generation of PIM (Privacy-Integrated Mobility) traces. The method for generating these traces is based on the scheme proposed in [27], and we refer interested readers to that work for a detailed analysis and evaluation. Our simulations reveal that \(\delta\) cannot be too large or too small. 

- **Large \(\delta\)**: When \(\delta\) is large, locations with small prior probabilities are likely to be excluded from the \(\delta\)-location set, \(\Delta X\). This helps in maintaining a reasonable size for \(\Delta X\), but it may also fail to track location updates accurately.
- **Small \(\delta\)**: Conversely, a small \(\delta\) includes more locations with small prior probabilities in \(\Delta X\), potentially leading to a very large \(\Delta X\) (over 40 or more). This can result in incorrect tracking of the true location.

To achieve a good balance, we choose \(\delta = 0.02\). The impact of \(\delta\) on system performance will be discussed in Section 6.9.

We first extract a random participant and visually examine the PIM trace generated with different \(\ell\) values (Figures 7 and 8). It is evident that \(\ell = 2\) generates a PIM trace closer to the original trace, indicating smaller location errors. This is further confirmed in Figures 9a and 9d, where we compare the distance between the original trace and the PIM trace at each timestamp. When \(\ell = 1\), the distance error can be very high (e.g., over 5 km). Increasing \(\ell\) to 2 reduces the maximum distance error to around 3.5 km, a significant improvement.

Applying a sliding window (Figures 9b and 9e) further reduces the distance errors. For example, when \(\ell = 1\), the maximum distance error is reduced from 5.1 km to 3.2 km, and the average distance error is also greatly reduced. Reducing the distance error benefits TCR (Task Completion Rate) because the SSP (Spectrum Sensing Provider) has more accurate knowledge of participants' locations.

Finally, we compare the size of \(\Delta X\) in Figures 9c and 9f. The \(\Delta X\) size is larger when \(\ell = 1\) compared to when \(\ell = 2\), as expected. A larger \(\ell\) should better track the true location. We will further evaluate the relationship between \(\Delta X\) size and \(\ell\) later.

### 6.5 Effectiveness of Sliding Window
Figure 10a shows the impact of \(\mu\) on the total travel distance (TTD). A larger \(\mu\) generally results in a smaller TTD. When \(\mu = 1\) (no smoothing), the TTD is reduced from 67 km to 48 km, a 28.3% reduction, with the sliding window in place. However, the TTD reduction slows down when \(\mu > 5\). There is still a gap between our scheme and the baseline scheme, which is expected due to the trade-off between utility and privacy protection. The worst case, where no participant declines the assigned subtask, is also shown for comparison.

Figure 10b shows the TCR performance. The TCR improves dramatically from 0.7 to 0.9. The TCR increase slows down when \(\mu > 5\). Generally, a larger \(\mu\) leads to better performance in both TTD and TCR, but it also increases computational complexity.

### 6.6 Impact of Number of Participants
Figure 10c illustrates the impact of \(N\) (number of participants) on TTD. Generally, a larger \(N\) results in a smaller TTD for both schemes. Figure 10d shows the TCR performance, where more participants lead to higher task-completion rates. Even without noise added to the traces, the TCR is close to 0.93, indicating that some tasks might still fail to meet the diversity requirement due to remote sensing locations.

### 6.7 Impact of Number of Sensing Tasks
Figure 10e shows the impact of \(M\) (number of sensing tasks) on TTD. As expected, the distance increases with \(M\), although the increase is limited. Figure 10f shows that TCR decreases with \(M\). More tasks mean the SSP might have to select participants far away, leading to a higher assignment decline rate. Additionally, tasks in areas with low participant populations might fail.

### 6.8 Impact of \(\ell\)
We change the value of \(\ell\) in our simulations and evaluate the impact on performance. Figure 10g shows that TTD decreases with increasing \(\ell\), indicating that a larger \(\ell\) generates more precise mobility traces. Figure 10h shows that TCR in our scheme is almost identical to the baseline approach when \(\ell = 4\). Figure 11 shows the average \(\Delta X\) size, which drops from approximately 6.9 to 3.9 as \(\ell\) increases. This matches our expectation: a smaller \(\ell\) generates larger noise, resulting in a larger \(\Delta X\) and better location privacy.

### 6.9 Impact of \(\delta\)
\(\delta\) has a similar impact on system performance as \(\ell\), but the system is more sensitive to \(\delta\). Figure 10i shows TTD results with different \(\delta\) values. There is a significant decrement when \(\delta\) increases from 0.01 to 0.02, and the curve flattens when \(\delta > 0.02\). Thus, \(\delta = 0.02\) is a good choice. Correspondingly, TCR generally increases with \(\delta\), with the most observable gain when \(\delta\) increases from 0.01 to 0.02. A larger \(\delta\) means a smaller \(\Delta X\) and worse location privacy, but it also generates traces closer to the original, reducing distance errors. Figure 12 shows the average \(\Delta X\) size, which drops dramatically from 15.3 to 4.4 when \(\delta\) increases from 0.01 to 0.03. To ensure sufficient location privacy, \(\delta = 0.02\) is a good choice.

### 6.10 Impact of \(\alpha\)
We vary the value of \(\alpha\), the distance weight ratio between the waiting-time equivalent distance and the true travel distance in our synthetic travel distance model (Equation 5). Figures 10k and 10l show the TTD and TCR results, respectively. The increase in \(\alpha\) only slightly affects both TTD and TCR, indicating that our system is consistent with various distance models. Additionally, \(\alpha\) might directly relate to the payment to each participant, with a smaller \(\alpha\) indicating smaller payments. Since we do not propose additional payment schemes, further analysis is omitted.

### 6.11 Impact of \(\beta\)
\(\beta\) is a system parameter that adjusts the priority to ensure the desired sensing diversity. Figures 10m and 10n show the simulation results of TTD and TCR, respectively. A larger \(\beta\) leads to an increased TTD because more participants are selected to perform the sensing tasks. The benefit of a larger \(\beta\) is clear in Figure 10n, where TCR is almost 1 when \(\beta = 1.4\) and 1 when \(\beta = 1.6\). This ensures that all sensing tasks are fulfilled with enough participants to guarantee sufficient spatial sensing diversity. When \(\beta = 1\), tasks not fulfilled are usually located remotely. The SSP can dynamically determine \(\beta\) based on the demographic properties of the areas, ensuring most tasks are fulfilled while reducing unnecessary TTD.

### 6.12 Impact of \(div^*\)
Lastly, we evaluate the impact of the diversity requirement \(div^*\). Figure 10o shows that a larger \(div^*\) results in a dramatic increase in TTD because more participants are needed to fulfill the sensing tasks. Figure 10p shows the change in TCR, where a higher diversity order negatively impacts TCR, as seen in both the baseline scheme and our scheme.

### 7. RELATED WORK
In this section, we discuss prior work related to DPSense. There is extensive literature on location privacy in general frameworks, with a review of location privacy-preserving mechanisms (LPPMs) in [16] and a formal framework for LPPM analysis in [22].

Significant efforts have been made to protect location privacy in CSS (Crowdsourced Spectrum Sensing) systems [10, 15, 17, 25]. These works aim to prevent location privacy leakage from sensing reports submitted by crowdsourced sensing users. In [15], we proposed a privacy-preserving CSS framework that achieves differential location privacy, approximate social cost minimization, and truthfulness. Here, we assume the SSP is honest-but-curious and address a different problem.

Another line of work addresses location privacy in general crowdsourced mobile sensing systems [19, 23]. To et al. [23] proposed a framework to protect worker location privacy during task assignment. Unlike [23], DPSense does not require a trusted service provider and targets a different application scenario with strict sensing time requirements. Pournajaf et al. [19] considered spatial task assignment for crowd sensing with cloaked locations, but their system model and time constraints differ from DPSense.

There is also growing interest in task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing [4, 5, 13]. He et al. [13] aimed to maximize platform rewards considering geographic locations and time budgets of mobile users but did not consider maximizing task fulfillment. Cheng et al. [4] aimed to maximize spatial and temporal diversity but did not minimize travel distances. Deng et al. [5] studied the combination of task assignment and scheduling but did not provide location privacy guarantees and had different task deadlines.

Differential privacy [7, 18] has emerged as a powerful tool for data privacy, with Xiao et al. [27] proposing a planar isotropic mechanism for location perturbation, achieving the lower bound of differential privacy in specific scenarios.

### 8. CONCLUSIONS
Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has the potential to address global spectrum shortages by enhancing spectrum efficiency. Crowdsourced spectrum sensing (CSS) allows a spectrum sensing provider (SSP) to outsource spectrum occupancy sensing to distributed mobile users. In this paper, we proposed DPSense, a framework that enables the SSP to select mobile users for spatiotemporal spectrum-sensing tasks while preserving location privacy. Evaluations on real location traces confirm that DPSense provides differential location privacy and ensures that the SSP can accomplish spectrum-sensing tasks with minimal cost and high probability.
