User: I am new to linux.
I made a python script that takes two input 
Input 1> directory path ex:- ~/home/user/apps
Input 2> file path
File contains pattern in each line 
And the output of script is all the file that matches the pattern  and are in directory or in subdirectories of input directory path.
Now using this python script I want to make a command in Linux like:
core_dump@core_dump-VPCCB15FG:~/python$search directory_path file_path
Assistant: add the program to your /bin directory - it's where linux will search for the command
