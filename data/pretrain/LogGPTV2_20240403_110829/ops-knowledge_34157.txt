User: Please introduce the commonly used big data processing frameworks, and explain their respective characteristics and applicable scenarios.
Assistant: Common big data processing frameworks include Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Flink, Hive, Pig, etc. 1. Hadoop: Hadoop is one of the earliest big data processing frameworks, which includes the distributed file system HDFS and the distributed computing framework MapReduce. The advantage of Hadoop is that its data storage is stable and reliable, and it has good compatibility with other tools in the ecosystem, and its computing power is also very powerful. Applicable scenarios: suitable for processing PB-level data. 2. Spark: Spark is one of the most popular big data processing frameworks. Its main feature is that it runs very fast and supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and Scala. The characteristic of Spark is that it uses memory-based computing, which is much faster than traditional MapReduce computing, and also supports real-time stream processing. Applicable scenarios: Applicable to scenarios that require high data processing speed and pursue near real-time processing, such as real-time advertising bidding, real-time push of mobile applications, etc. 3. Storm: Storm is an open source, distributed real-time computing framework, which can process real-time large-scale data streams, and has the characteristics of ultra-low latency and high throughput. It supports the access of multiple data sources and destinations, and allows parallel processing of data streams, suitable for real-time data processing scenarios. Applicable scenarios: mainly used to process real-time streaming data, such as financial market data, logistics data, etc. 4. Flink: Flink is a very new stream processing framework that supports batch and stream processing modes, and supports multiple languages, including Java, Scala, and Python. Flink is characterized by its high performance, low latency and fault tolerance, and it can also process large data. It is suitable for data processing scenarios that pursue high processing speed and high accuracy. Applicable scenarios: It is suitable for processing massive real-time data, and performing real-time calculation and analysis on real-time data. 5. Hive: Hive is a Hadoop-based data warehouse tool that allows users to perform SQL queries and process data. The advantage of Hive is that it supports SQL very well and is easy to use. At the same time, it also integrates tools in other Hadoop ecosystems, such as HBase. Applicable scenarios: It is suitable for the establishment and maintenance of data warehouses. For tasks that require complex data query and analysis, using Hive can greatly improve efficiency and convenience. 6. Pig: Pig has a good interface with the Hadoop ecosystem. Based on the Pig Latin language, it can perform various data operations such as data processing, data integration, and data conversion. It can also cooperate with other Hadoop tools such as Hive and HBase. Applicable scenarios: Suitable for small data processing and beginners' entry.
