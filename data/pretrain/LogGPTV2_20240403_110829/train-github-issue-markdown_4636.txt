This feature request is likely relevant to the `mlab` module. Although I have not verified it, the count plotting functions probably rely on a private function similar to `contourc` in the background. Providing access to this function would be very beneficial.

Currently, my workflow involves creating a figure, drawing a contour plot, and then closing the figure. Access to the underlying `contourc`-like function would streamline this process.
