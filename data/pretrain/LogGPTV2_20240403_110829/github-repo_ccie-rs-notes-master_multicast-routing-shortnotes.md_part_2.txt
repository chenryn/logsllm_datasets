### Dynamically Finding RP using Auto-RP
* Sends RP-Announce to 224.0.1.39, stating is an RP
* Message allows router to advertise groups its RP for, allowing some
  load balancing
* Sent every minute
* Next, needs a router to be a mapping agent. Often same as RP, doesn't
  have to be.
* Learns RPs and groups they support
* Sends message called RP-Discovery, identifies RP for each range of
  groups
* Message to 224.0.1.40
* General router population now now which routers are RPs
* RP-Discovery so that Auto-RP mapping agent decides which RP for each
  group. Useful for RP redundancy, supports multiple RPs for a group
* Mapping agent selects router with highest IP as RP for group
* Can have multiple mapping agents
* If router with PIM-SM and Auto-RP config'd, automatically join
  224.0.1.40 CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY group
* Learns Group-to-RP mappings, maintains in cace
* When PIM-SM router gets IGMP or PIM-SM join, checks mapping in cache
Summarized steps: -
1. RP config'd with Auto-RP, announces itself and supported groups to
224.0.1.39
2. Auto-RP mapping agent gathers info about all RPs (RP Annoucnce
Messages)
3. Mapping Agent builds table of best RP for groups
4. RP-Discover from MA to 224.0.1.40 with mappings
5. All routers listen for packets to 224.0.1.40
* Problem is that PIM-SM routers need to send a join to RP they don't
  know yet
* Sparse-Dense Mode helps, makes a router dense if no RP known, SM when
  it does
* Dense long enough to learn mappings, then to sparse
* Configure per interface with **ip pim sparse-dense-mode**
* Can avoid unnecessary dense mode flooding with Auto-RP listener
* This means only Auto-RP traffic flooded out all SM interfaces
* **ip pim autorp listener**
Normal router: -
```
ip multicast-routing
int Se0
 ip pim sparse-mode
ip pim autorp listener
```
Auto-RP Mapping Agent
```
ip multicast-routing
ip pim send-rp-discovery scope 10 # Can designate source int
int Se0
 ip pim sparse-mode
```
Auto-RP RP
```
ip multicast routing
int lo0
 ip address 10.1.10.3 255.255.255.255
 ip pim sparse-mode
int Se0
 ip pim sparse-mode
ip pim send-rp-announce loopback0 scope 10
```
### Dynamically finding RP using BSR
* PIMv2 provides BSR
* Similar to AutoRP
* RP sends message to another router collecting group-to-RP mapping
* That router distributes mappings
* Once router is BSR (similar to mapping agent)
Differences from BSR to Mapping Agent: -
* Does not pick best RP for each group
* All mappings sent to PIM routers in bootstrap messages
* Routers pick current best RP by using same hash algorithm on info in
  bootstrap message
* BSR floods mapping info to ALL-PIM-ROUTERS (224.0.0.13)
* Flooding not required to have a known RP
* PIM-SM floods bootstraps out all non-RPF ints, meaning one copy of
  message to every router
* If BS message on non-RPF int, drop pacekt to prevent loops
* Each candidate RP (c-RP) informs BSR it is an RP and groups it
  supports
* All PIM routers know unicast IP of BSR due to earlier BS messages
* C-RPs unicast messages to BSR, with IP used by c-RP and groups
* BSR suports redundant RPs and BSRs
* BS messages contain all c-RPs
* For multiple BSRs, c-BSRs send BS with priority and its IP
 * Highest priority wins, then highest IP
* Winning BSR sends BSR messages, other BSRs monitor
 * If cease, others take over
* Minimum config is a cRP or cBSR, and source of messages
* ACL can limit what groups router will be RP for
* Can specify priority for multiple BSRs

### Anycast RP with MSDP
* Anycast RP can use RP config, Auto-RP and BSR
* Without anycast RP - One router to be active for each group, load
  sharing for some groups, not others
* With Anycast RP - Multiple RPs acting as RP for same group
* Each RP uses same IP, /32 prefix with IGP
* All methods view multiple RPs as single RP
* Packets routed per IGP to closest RP
* If RP fails, just needs IGP convergence to change
# Interdomain Multicast Routing with MSDP
* Avoids issue when m'cast source might be in one side of netwokr, but
  not other
 * When anycast present and therefore one side of network doesnt see it
* RP uses MSDP to send messages to peer RPs
* Source Active messages list IP of each source for each m'cast group
* Unicast over TCP connection, maintained between RPs
* Static config
* RPs must have routes to each of their peers and to sources (BGP or
  M'cast BGP used for routing)
* RP in one domain could use MSDP to tell RP in another about multicast
  source for specific group at unicast IP (eg 226.1.1.1 known by
172.16.5.5)
* RP in another domain then floods into to any other MSDP peers
* Receiver in its domain joins SPT of source 172.16.5.5, group 226.1.1.1
* If RP no receivers for group, caches them for later
* MSDP RPs send SAs every 60s
* lists roups and sources
* RP can request new list with SA request
* SA response sent back
* Configure Auto-RP or BSR first
* If MSDP between routing domaings, then needs BGP
* MSDP peers specified on each router

# Bidirectional PIM
* PIM-SM inefficient with large number of sends and receivers
Steps for Bidi are
1. RP builds shared tree with root (same as SM)
2. When source sends m'casts, router receiving does not use PIM register. Instead, forwards packets in opposite direction of shared tree to RP
3. RP forwards through shared tree
4. All packets forwarded per step 2 and 3, RP does not join source tree for source, leaf do no join SPT either
# Comparison of DM and SM
* While SM more complex, more popular
* PIM-SM quickly moves to SPT when senders and receivers increase, same
  SPT PIM-DM would have derived
# Source-Specific Multicast
* Scenarios p to know using ISM (Internet Standard Multicast)
* No worrying about source
* Can lead to overlapping m'cast IPs (some streams using same addresses
  as address space not large)
* DoS attacks - Attack can be source, can interrupt stream or tax
  routers/switches
* Complexity - Complexity increases in large networks
* SSM receivers known unicast IP of source, specify it in group
* SSM receivers subscribe to S,G with both source and group address
* Hosts then only receive from specific sources
* Hard to DoS if not got source IP, and path needs to go through RPF
  checks
* RPs dont need to track which sources are active, as sources known
* Only edge routers nearest host need SSM
* Uses IGMPv3
* **ip pim ssm { default | range** *access-list* **}**. Addresses in
  232.0.0.0/24
* Default permits to forward all multicasts in that range
* Can limit groups with ACL and range keyword
* Need IGMPv3 under each interface

# Implementing v6 Multicast PIM
* **ipv6 multicast-routing**
 * Enables on all interfaces
 * Assumes v6 PIM, doesnt appear in config
 * Always sparse mode
* **no ipv6 pim** interface command
* Tunnels formed for multicast routing
 * Dynamically when above enabled
* Tunnel protocol in **show int tunnel** - PIM/IPv6
* **show ipv6 pim neighbors**
 * Formed using link locals
 * DRs still elected
 * Values maniped as per v4
## Designated Priority Manipulation
```
int Fa0/0
 ipv6 pim dr-priority  - Higher is better
```
* **show ipv6 pim neighbor** show connect to DR
## PIM v6 Hello Interval
* Every 30s
* When all neighbours replied, DR chosen
* Highest priority, then highest IP
* Holdtime is 3.5 times hello
* Can auth with MD5 hah
## IPv6 Sparse-Mode Multicast
* For RP, Static, v6 BSR and Embedded RP
* No Auto-RP or dense mode
### v6 Static RP
```
ipv6 pim rp-address 2001:2:2:2::2
```
* **show ipv6 pim range-list**
### IPv6 BSR
```
ipv6 pim bsr candidate bsr 200:1:2:2:2::2
ipv6 pim bsr candidate rp 2001:1:1:1::1
ipv6 pim bsr candidate rp 2001:3:3:3::3
```
* Verify with **show ipv6 pim bsr rp-cache**, shows Cache from RPs
* **show ipv6 bsr candidate-rp**
### Multicast Listener Discover (MLD)
* Static group join with **ipv6 mld join-group** *group-address*
* IGMP replaced by MLD in v6
 * v1 similar to IGMPv2
 * v2 similar to v3
 * v2 supports SSM in v6
* Hosts indicate they want m'cast from selected groups
* Queriers elected through MLD
* ICMP carries messages inside, link-local in scope, router alert option
  set
* Three messages, Query, Report, Done
 * Done like leave, triggers query to check more recivers on segment
* Config options similar to IGMP
 * **ipv6 mld limit** - limits number of recipients
 * **ipv6 mld join-group** - permanent subscribe on interface
* On **ipv6 multicast-routing**, MLD auto enabled
* **show ipv6 pim interdace**
* **show ipv6 mld interface**
* **show ipv6 pim traffic**
### Embedded RP
* RP can be part of m'cast group address
* Router extracts RP's identity and uses it for shared tree immediately
* Identity of RP explcitily config'd on dvice that is RP
* No other config required
* If trying to embed 128-bit RP address into 128-bit group, issue in
  leaving space for group identity
Accomplish embedding with following rules: -
* Must indicate m'cast group contains embeded RP by tsetting first 8
  bits to all 1s, so should always start with FF:70::/12
* Numeric designation for scope, FF7x: -
 * 1 - Interface local
 * 2 - Link local
 * 4 - Admin local
 * 5 - site local 
 * 8 - org local
 * E - Global
* Isolated three values from RP
 * RP Int ID
 * Prefix length in hex
 * RP prefix
* Organized as per below
```
FF7:0:::
```
Example: -
* RP of 2001:2:2:2::2/64
* RP interface is 2 (taken form ::2)
* Prefix length 64 (40 in hex)
* RP prefix 2001:2:2:2
* Global Scope
* 32 bit group ID commonly 0
* FF7E:0240:2001:2:2:2:0:1
* **show ipv6 mroute**
* **show ipv6 pim group-map**
* Make sure router knows it is RP with **ipv6 pim rp-address**
* Use above embeded address for group joins on other routers
