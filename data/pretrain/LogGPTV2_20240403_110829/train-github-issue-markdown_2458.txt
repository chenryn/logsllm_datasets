  1. Successfully installed the static library containing the core code of TensorFlow.
  2. Downloaded Inception v1.

  ```cpp
  #include "unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor"

  This line results in an error, suggesting that the Eigen version might be incorrect. I have installed Eigen, but the issue persists.
