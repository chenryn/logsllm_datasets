User: so I made that python program using several module including os, zipfile, time, datetime, shutil, shelve and ftplib. I froze it with cx_freeze, it won't run on the target machine (but it run on mine). I'm super new to cx_freeze, but I've poked around a bit and I suspect it's a module ot found error. Trouble is, when I execute the exe on the target machine the window doesn't stay open long enough for me to catch the error message so I can't even narrow down the issue to try and solve it. Any idea on how I could deal with it?
Assistant: Executing the exe from the console works out fine. Thanks.
