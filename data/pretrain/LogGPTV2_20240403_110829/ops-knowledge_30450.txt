User: I'm using Vim and lots of Vim plugins, on a Windows machine. Some of these plugins use Python 2, and some use Python 3.
I can use only one in the system %PATH% environment variable, how can I overcome this limitation?
Assistant: Vim's Python integration (i.e. the :python[3] commands that most plugins use) does not depend on the python interpreter binary (from PATH); instead, Vim must have been compiled with the Python library(-ies), which you can check in the :version output (look for +python, and the -DDYNAMIC_PYTHON_DLL=...).
To be able to use both Python versions, you need both +python/dyn and +python3/dyn, and the corresponding DLLs accessible. You can check with the :py / :py3 commands.
