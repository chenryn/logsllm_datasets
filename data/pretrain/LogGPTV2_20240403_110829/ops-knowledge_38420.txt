User: I have read about python sched (task scheduler), it works like a cron.
but I have a question :   

lets say if I schedule a function to run after every 2 hours and in the mean time my system gets shut down, then I again restart the system...

Does the scheduler automatically start and run the function after 2 hours? Or do I have to start that again after shutting down the system?

Does sched work like a daemon?
Assistant: Answer to all three questions is No.
sched is different from cron. It takes a generic timer or counter function and a delay function and lets you to schedule a function call after a particular time (an event as defined by your generic timer function).
It won't run after you close your program, unless you maintain state by writing to a file or db. This is complicated and using cron would be better.
sched works on events, but not on background. so, it not is not exactly a deamon, but you can deamonize it running the program in the background using OS facilities.
