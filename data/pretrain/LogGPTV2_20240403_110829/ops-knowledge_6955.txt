User: Please explain what a DDoS attack is and how to protect against it.
Assistant: DDoS attack refers to a distributed denial of service attack, that is, the attacker uses multiple computers to send a large amount of data traffic to the target server, causing the target server to fail to provide services normally and become paralyzed. This type of attack is commonly used in cyberattacks, extortion and reprisals. For the prevention of DDoS attacks, the following measures can be taken: 1. Use a professional DDoS defense system: This system can detect and filter a large number of attack traffic from different sources in real time through various technical means, so as to ensure the normal operation of the server. run. 2. Increase the bandwidth capacity: In order to resist a large amount of attack traffic, the bandwidth can be increased to a level sufficient to accommodate the attack traffic, thereby reducing the impact of the attack on the server. 3. Modify server software and configuration: optimize server performance and security by upgrading server software and configuration, thereby reducing the risk of server being attacked. 4. Limit traffic source: You can limit the source of traffic according to the IP address of the traffic source and the type of data packet, thereby reducing the impact of the attack on the server.
