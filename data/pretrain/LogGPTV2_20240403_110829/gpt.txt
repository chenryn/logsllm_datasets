### Overview
On basic GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks, the `gpt attributes` command assigns specific GPT attributes to the partition that is currently in focus. These attributes provide additional information about the use and behavior of the partition. Some attributes are specific to the partition type GUID.

### Prerequisites
You must select a basic GPT partition for this operation to succeed. Use the `select partition` command to choose a basic GPT partition and shift the focus to it.

### Caution
Modifying GPT attributes can cause your basic data volumes to fail to be assigned drive letters or prevent the file system from mounting. We strongly recommend that you do not change the GPT attributes unless you are an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or an IT professional with experience in managing GPT disks.

### Syntax
```plaintext
gpt attributes=<attributes>
```

### Parameters
- **attributes**: Specifies the value for the attribute you want to apply to the partition in focus. The GPT attribute field is a 64-bit field that contains two subfields: a higher field that is interpreted in the context of the partition ID, and a lower field that is common to all partition IDs. 

Accepted values include:
- **0x0000000000000001**: Indicates that the partition is required by the computer to function properly.
- **0x8000000000000000**: Prevents the partition from receiving a drive letter by default when the disk is moved to another computer or when the disk is first seen by a computer.
- **0x4000000000000000**: Hides the partition's volume so that it is not detected by the mount manager.
- **0x2000000000000000**: Specifies that the partition is a shadow copy of another partition.
- **0x1000000000000000**: Marks the partition as read-only, preventing the volume from being written to.

For more information about these attributes, refer to the `attributes` section in the `CREATE_PARTITION_PARAMETERS` structure.

### Examples
To prevent the computer from automatically assigning a drive letter to the partition in focus while moving a GPT disk, use the following command:
```plaintext
gpt attributes=0x8000000000000000
```

This will ensure that the partition does not receive a drive letter by default on other computers.
