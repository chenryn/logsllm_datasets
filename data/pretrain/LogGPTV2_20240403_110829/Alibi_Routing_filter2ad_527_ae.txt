### Complementary Use of Alibi Routing with Other Techniques

While Alibi Routing itself cannot guarantee complete avoidance for users in a censored regime, it can complement other existing methods. For example, consider Tor [10], where a source node selects a set of relay nodes to construct a virtual circuit. These relays are typically chosen at random, which can result in two consecutive relays whose traffic passes through a censoring regime. By integrating Alibi Routing into Tor’s relay selection process, one can compute circuits that provably avoid known censors. Additionally, Alibi Routing can be combined with decoy routing: for instance, using decoy routing to exit a censored regime and then employing Alibi Routing to avoid further censors along the path. These examples illustrate the potential of Alibi Routing to enhance prior work.

### Influence of Overlay Paths on Underlay Routes

Overlay routing protocols, such as RON [3] and SOSR [15], have shown that overlay paths can influence and improve underlay paths. A natural approach would be to use overlay routing to find a path that avoids a censor, similar to how SOSR uses one-hop relays to avoid slow network segments. This is the approach we take, but the primary challenges lie in proving when a relay avoids a part of the network and finding relays that can provide such proof. To address these challenges, our overlay routing techniques leverage the relationship between geographic distance and latencies.

### Latency-Based Avoidance in Unstructured Overlays

Other systems, such as Meridian [44], incorporate latency measurements into overlay routing. Meridian is an unstructured overlay system that iteratively uses latency measurements to perform queries like nearest-neighbor search and leader election. While it may be possible to achieve some form of avoidance routing with Meridian, it is not designed for adversarial settings. An attacker can easily fabricate higher round-trip times (RTTs) to appear "not too near." The mechanisms we present in this paper can help secure such systems.

### Geographic Routing

Geographic routing protocols, including Alibi Routing, use the location of nodes in their routing decisions [20, 32, 23]. Typically, these protocols apply a greedy heuristic to move as close to the target as possible at each hop. This is similar to Alibi Routing's use of target regions, but we are not aware of any geographic routing protocol that achieves avoidance in an adversarial setting. In such a setting, a greedy heuristic can, in the worst case, traverse a forbidden region or forward traffic to a node just outside the border of the forbidden country. Alibi Routing demonstrates that balancing progress and safety is crucial for achieving high query success rates, and these lessons can be applied to other geographic routing protocols.

### Accountability and Provenance

A common approach to proving what routers did not do is to exhaustively prove what actions they did take. There is extensive prior work on holding network participants accountable for their actions [2, 16, 50]. For example, PeerReview [16] assigns "witnesses" to monitor all incoming and outgoing messages and emulate the protocol to ensure correct behavior. More recent research applies counterfactual reasoning to attribute a set of (in)actions leading to the absence of an expected event [45]. However, it is unclear how to apply these approaches to provable route avoidance, as it would require witnesses to verify latency measurements, which is generally not feasible. Alibi Routing's lightweight proof structure can be performed using only local observations, and we believe our "proof by alibi" can be combined with both positive and negative provenance systems to yield broader inferences.

### Conclusion

This paper introduces a primitive, provable avoidance routing, which, given a destination and a region to avoid, provides "proof" that a packet and its response did not traverse the forbidden region. We rely on the insight that a packet can provide an "alibi"—a place and time where it was—to prove that it must have avoided the forbidden region during transit from source to destination.

To demonstrate the feasibility of this primitive, we developed and evaluated an overlay routing protocol called Alibi Routing. Alibi Routing assumes that nodes outside the forbidden region are trustworthy in reporting their geographic locations and vouching for nearby neighbors. It leverages this assumption to direct relay discovery queries toward a target region where alibis might reside.

Our empirical results show that Alibi Routing is effective at finding alibis for various forbidden countries. However, it is not a panacea, particularly for hosts very close to or inside the regions they seek to avoid. Nevertheless, because its properties are largely orthogonal to prior work, we believe Alibi Routing will compose well with them to strengthen security guarantees. Moreover, the techniques we introduced can be applied to myriad other domains.

There are several possible extensions to Alibi Routing, such as allowing routes through more than one relay, which could potentially improve success rates. Discovering multi-relay paths and generating proof that they collectively avoid a forbidden region is an interesting area for future work.
