### Feature Request: Native ECMAScript Module Output

**Request Type:**  
This is a feature request, as it involves considerations related to build tooling and the best approach for implementing this feature.

**Current Behavior:**  
- The current build tools do not support generating native ECMAScript modules (ESM).
- While investigating the use of a native ESM version of React and ReactDOM in modern browsers, I found that no existing implementation outputs native ESM.
- Currently, one can only use a wrapped version of the transpiled code with added export statements. However, transpiling is unnecessary for browsers that natively support ESM.
- Even though spread operators are supported by these browsers, they are not fully supported by AST generators or other tools due to the evolving specification.

**Investigation and Proof of Concept:**
- After experimenting with various build tools and settings, I developed a proof of concept (POC) that generates ESM-compatible output for use in modern browsers.
- The challenge is that the tools and settings used in the POC conflict with the current build configuration and tools.
- I am unsure whether this should be integrated as an additional build target or if it would be more appropriate to maintain it in an external repository for now.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Ideally, there should be a build target that supports generating native ECMAScript modules.

**Questions and Considerations:**
- Is this feature considered worthwhile, and if so, what is the preferred way to implement it?
- During my investigation, I found that implementing this feature would require significant changes to the existing codebase and build tooling, making it a high-risk endeavor.
- Key challenges include:
  - Differences between Webpack and Rollup.
  - Different Babel settings required for ESM.
  - Transitioning from CommonJS `module.exports` to named exports.
  - The impact of these changes on the overall build process.

**Clarification and Links:**
- **POC Repository for React and ReactDOM ESM Output:**
  - [React and ReactDOM ESM Output](https://github.com/wearespindle/react-ecmascript)
- **Minimal Setup to Test ESM in a Browser:**
  - [Module Test](https://github.com/PM5544/module-test)

**Affected Versions:**
- This issue is not specific to any particular version of React or browser/OS, as it pertains to the build process rather than runtime behavior.

If you have any feedback or suggestions on how to proceed, I would greatly appreciate it.
