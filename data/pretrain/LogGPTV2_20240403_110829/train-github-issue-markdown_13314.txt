 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
This probably is a feature request since the root of this is considering the
build tooling and questions on how to proceed with my efforts.
**What is the current behavior?**  
No native ecmascript module output and the current build tools don't easily
allow adding a native ecmascript module build target.
While investigating a workflow using a native ecmascript module version of
React (and ReactDOM) in browsers I found no implementation which outputs
native ecmascript modules.  
One can use a wrapped version of the transpiled versions with added export
statements but transpiling would not be necessary for browsers supporting
ecmascript modules natively.  
Even spread operators are supported by these browsers although they're not
fully supported by AST generators or other tools due to the fact that the spec
for that isn't finalised.
After some test projects and different build tools I built a simple proof of
concept which outputs ecmascript modules that can be used in modern browsers.  
The challenge (and question I have) is that the tools and settings used in the
POC contradict the current build settings and tools.  
So I am wondering if this is something that can be added as a build target or
that this is something that is better suitable for an external repo for the
time being...
I would love to make this happen but I would like to hear if this is something
that is deemed worth while and if so in what would be the preferred way of
implementing this.  
During my investigation I did not find an easy way of doing so without
changing a considerable amount of code and build tooling. Making this a
relatively high risk endeavour.  
Webpack vs Rollup, different settings needed for Babel, and named exports
instead of CommonJS module.exports pattern to name a few, and all the effects
those have on the build process make this somewhat complex.
To clarify some things, these are links to the POC's:  
repo which outputs native ecmascript modules for React and ReactDOM:
https://github.com/wearespindle/react-ecmascript  
repo with a minimal setup to test if a working app can be made these modules
in a browser: https://github.com/PM5544/module-test
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Preferably a build target for native ecmascript modules.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
not relevant
