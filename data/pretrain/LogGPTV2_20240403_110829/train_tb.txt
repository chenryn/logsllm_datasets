        change page cross-references for console_ioctl(4) to ioctl_console(2)
changes to individual pages
---------------------------
alarm.2
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add timer_create(2) and timerfd_create(2)
chmod.2
fsync.2
mkdir.2
mknod.2
open.2
truncate.2
umask.2
utime.2
utimensat.2
    michael kerrisk
        add/replace references to inode(7)
clone.2
    michael kerrisk
        clone_newcgroup by an unprivileged process also causes an eperm error
clone.2
unshare.2
    michael kerrisk
        exceeding one of the limits in /proc/sys/user/* can cause enospc
    michael kerrisk
        clone_newpid yields enospc if nesting limit of pid namespaces is reached
    michael kerrisk
        exceeding the maximum nested user namespace limit now gives enospc
            formerly, if the limit of 32 nested user namespaces was exceeded,
            the error eusers resulted. starting with linux 4.9, the error
            is enospc.
epoll_ctl.2
    michael kerrisk
        defer to poll(2) for an explanation of epollin
    michael kerrisk  [nicolas biscos]
        epollerr is also set on write end of a pipe when the read end is closed
    michael kerrisk  [nicolas biscos]
        give the reader a clue that the 'events' field can be zero
            'events' specified as zero still allows epollhup and
            epollerr to be reported.
_exit.2
    michael kerrisk
        on exit, child processes may be inherited by a "subreaper"
            it is no longer necessarily true that orphaned processes
            are inherited by pid 1.
    michael kerrisk
        only the least significant byte of exit status is passed to the parent
fcntl.2
    michael kerrisk
        mention memfd_create() in the discussion of file seals
            give the reader a clue about what kinds of objects can
            be employed with file seals.
    michael kerrisk
        file seals are not generally applicable to tmpfs(5) files
            as far as i can see, file seals can be applied only to
            memfd_create(2) file descriptors. this was checked by experiment
            and by reading mm/shmem.c::shmem_get_inode((), where one finds
            the following line that applies to all new shmem files:
                            info->seals = f_seal_seal;
            only in the code of the memfd_create() system call is this
            setting reversed (in mm/shmem.c::memfd_create):
                    if (flags & mfd_allow_sealing)
                            info->seals &= ~f_seal_seal;
fork.2
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add pthread_atfork(3)
getdents.2
open.2
stat.2
statx.2
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add inode(7)
getdtablesize.2
attr.5
    alexander miller
        move .so directive to first line
            improves compatibility with the man and other dumb tools
            that process man page files.
getpid.2
    michael kerrisk
        mention init(1) and "subreapers" in discussion of parent pid
ioctl_list.2
    cyril hrubis  [arnd bergmann]
        blkraset/blkraget take unsigned long
ioctl_ns.2
    michael kerrisk
        errors: document enotty
kexec_load.2
sched_setaffinity.2
bootparam.7
    michael kerrisk
        documentation/kernel-parameters.txt is now in documentation/admin-guide/
lseek.2
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add fallocate(2)
            both of these pages discuss file holes.
mincore.2
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add fincore(1)
mmap.2
    michael kerrisk
        remove ancient reference to flags that appear on some other systems
            map_autogrow, map_autoresrv, map_copy, and map_local may have
            appeared on some systems many years ago, but  the discussion here
            mentions no details and the systems and flags probably ceased to
            be relevant long ago. so, remove this text.
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add userfaultfd(2)
open.2
    michael kerrisk
        add statx() to list of "at" calls in rationale discussion
poll.2
    michael kerrisk
        expand discussion of pollpri
    michael kerrisk  [nicolas biscos]
        pollerr is also set on write end of a pipe when the read end is closed
posix_fadvise.2
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add fincore(1)
prctl.2
    mike frysinger
        pr_set_mm: refine config_checkpoint_restore requirement
            the linux 3.10 release dropped the c/r requirement and opened it
            up to all users.
    mike frysinger
        pr_set_mm: document new pr_set_mm_map{,_size} helpers
    mike frysinger
        pr_set_mm: document arg4/arg5 zero behavior
            the kernel will immediately reject calls where arg4/arg5 are not
            zero.  see kernel/sys.c:prctl_set_mm().
    michael kerrisk
        explain rationale for use of subreaper processes
    michael kerrisk
        note semantics of child_subreaper setting on fork() and exec()
    michael kerrisk
        improve description of pr_set_child_subreaper
rename.2
    michael kerrisk  [georg sauthoff]
        note that there is no glibc wrapper for renameat2()
sched_setaffinity.2
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add get_nprocs(3)

    michael kerrisk  [matthew wilcox, carlos o'donell]
        linux select() is buggy wrt posix in its check for ebadf errors
    michael kerrisk
        show correspondence between select() and poll() readiness notifications
    michael kerrisk
        give a hint that sets must be reinitialized if using select() in a loop
    michael kerrisk
        refer to pollpri in poll(2) for info on exceptional conditions
    michael kerrisk

        show the prototype of an sa_siginfo signal handler
signalfd.2
    michael kerrisk
        sigkill and sigstop are silently ignored in 'mask'
sigprocmask.2
    dmitry v. levin
        do not specify an exact value of rt_sigprocmask's 4th argument
            as sizeof(kernel_sigset_t) is not the same for all architectures,
            it would be better not to mention any numbers as its value.
    michael kerrisk
        'set' and 'oldset' can both be null
sigwaitinfo.2
    michael kerrisk
        sigwaitinfo() can't be used to accept synchronous signals
socketcall.2

       document call argument
stat.2
    michael kerrisk
        remove information migrated to inode(7) page
    michael kerrisk
        restructure field descriptions as a hanging list
    michael kerrisk
        remove "other systems" subsection
            these details about other systems were added in 1999,
            and were probably of limited use then, and even less today.
            however, they do clutter the page, so remove them.
    michael kerrisk
        description: add list entries for 'st_uid' and 'st_gid'
    michael kerrisk
        add some subsection headings to ease readability
    david howells
        errors: correct description of enoent
    michael kerrisk
        give 'struct stat' argument a more meaningful name ('statbuf')
    marcin Å›lusarz
        tweak description of at_empty_path
            currently it says when dirfd is at_fdcwd it can be something
            other than directory, which doesn't make much sense. just swap
            the order of sentences.
    michael kerrisk
        add slightly expanded description of 'st_ino' field
    michael kerrisk
        description: add a list entry for 'st_ino'
    michael kerrisk
        description: add a list entry for 'st_nlinks' field

        return value: fix error in return value description
            return value for failure was accidentally changed from null to
            -1 in man-pages commit 572acb41c48b6b8e690d50edff367d8b8b01702a.

nsswitch.conf.5
    florian weimer
        mention sudoers
            it turns out that sudo drops things into nsswitch.conf, too.
proc.5
    michael kerrisk
        refer to namespaces(7) for discussion of /proc/sys/user/* files
    michael kerrisk
        simplify /proc/slabinfo entry
            don't repeat (out-of-date) info from slabinfo(5); just defer to
            that page.
tmpfs.5
    michael kerrisk
        tmpfs supports extended attributes, but not 'user' extended attributes
environ.7
    jakub wilk
        fix name of function that honors tmpdir
            tempnam() takes the tmpdir environment variable into account, unlike
            tmpnam(), which always creates pathnames within /tmp.
hostname.7
    marko myllynen
        use lower case for hostname example
    marko myllynen
        use generic names in examples
    marko myllynen
        describe accepted characters for hostname
inotify.7
    michael kerrisk  [nicolas iooss]
        mounting a filesystem on top of a monitored directory causes no event
man-pages.7

        note preferred approach for 'duplicate' errors
pid_namespaces.7
    michael kerrisk
        the maximum nesting depth for pid namespaces is 32
user_namespaces.7
    stephan bergmann
        fixes to example
            while toying around with the userns_child_exec example program on the
            user_namespaces(7) man page, i noticed two things:
            * in the example section, we need to mount the new /proc before
              looking at /proc/$$/status, otherwise the latter will print
              information about the outer namespace's pid 1 (i.e., the real
              init).  so the two paragraphs need to be swapped.
            * in the program source, make sure to close pipe_fd[0] in the
              child before exec'ing.
pthreads.7
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add pthread_rwlockattr_setkind_np(3)
pty.7
    michael kerrisk
        mention a couple of other applications of pseudoterminals
sem_overview.7
    michael kerrisk

signal.7
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add sigreturn(2)
tcp.7
    michael kerrisk
        note indications for oob data given by select(2) and poll(2)
    chema gonzalez
        tcp_abc was removed in 3.9
xattr.7
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add ioctl_iflags(2)
            people sometimes confuse xattrs and inode flags. provide a link
            to the page that describes inode flags to give them a tip.
ld.so.8
    michael kerrisk
        mention quoting when using "rpath tokens" in ld_audit and ld_preload
    michael kerrisk
        expand description of /etc/ld.so.preload
    michael kerrisk
        mention ldconfig(8) in discussion of /etc/ld.so.cache

new and rewritten pages
-----------------------
ioctl_getfsmap.2
    darrick j. wong
        document the getfsmap ioctl
            document the new getfsmap ioctl that returns the physical layout of a
            (disk-based) filesystem.
newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------
namespaces.7
    kirill tkhai  [michael kerrisk]
        document the /proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children file
changes to individual pages
---------------------------
ldd.1
    michael kerrisk
        'objdump -p prog | grep needed' doesn't give quite same info as 'ldd'
chmod.2
    michael kerrisk
        put fchmod() feature test macro requirements in a more readable format
    michael kerrisk
        note glibc 2.24 feature test macro requirements changes for fchmod()
chown.2
    michael kerrisk
        when file owner or group is changed, file capabilities are cleared
    michael kerrisk
        changes to file owner by root also clear set-uid and set-gid bits
clone.2
    michael kerrisk
        update bugs to reflect fact that pid caching was removed in glibc 2.25
epoll_wait.2
    michael kerrisk
        clarify semantics of returned 'data' field
            the returned 'data' is the 'data' most recently set via
            epoll_ctl().
get_mempolicy.2
    michael kerrisk  [nadav har'el, andi kleen]
        synopsis: fix return type of get_mempolicy()
            see https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97051
getpid.2
    carlos o'donell, michael kerrisk
        note that pid caching is removed as of glibc 2.25
            since glibc 2.25 the pid cache is removed.
            rationale given in the release notes:
            https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/release/2.25#pid_cache_removal
ioctl.2
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add ioctl_getfsmap(2)
ioctl_getfsmap.2
    michael kerrisk
        fix ordering of sections
    michael kerrisk
        add versions section
    michael kerrisk
        errors: order alphabetically
madvise.2
    michael kerrisk
        remove bogus text re posix_madv_noreuse
            there is a posix_fadv_noreuse for posix_fadvise(),
            but no posix_madv_noreuse for any api in posix.
membarrier.2
    michael kerrisk
        add enosys error for 'nohz_full' cpu setting
mount.2
    neilbrown
        revise description of ms_remount | ms_bind
            ms_remount|ms_bind affects all per-mount-point
            flag.  ms_rdonly is only special because it,
            uniquely, is both a per-mount-point flag *and* a
            per-filesystem flag.
            so the sections of per-mount-point flags and
            ms_remount can usefully be clarified.
open.2
    michael kerrisk
        note some further advantages of the *at() apis
