I understand your frustration in trying to locate the default project files for web2py on macOS. If you are using the .app bundle, the project files are typically stored in the following directory:

```
/web2py/web2py.app/Contents/Resources/applications/
```

If you prefer to work with the source version of web2py, the applications will be located in:

```
/web2py/applications/
```

To access and edit these files using Sublime Text (or any other text editor), you can navigate to the appropriate directory and open the project files directly. This should allow you to make changes more easily than using the web-based admin interface.

If you still cannot find the files, please ensure that you have the correct version of web2py installed and that it is properly set up. Additionally, you may want to check the web2py documentation or community forums for further guidance.
