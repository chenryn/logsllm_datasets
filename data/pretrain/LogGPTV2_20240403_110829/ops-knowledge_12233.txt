User: I am pulling my hair out trying to figure out where web2py stores the project files by default in OS X. It is not located in the same directoy as the web2py.app .
I can launch the web interface and see project in the admin view but want to edit the files from sublime text as opposed to the admin web interface.
I've looked through the web2py book and google user book with no luck. Any suggestions, this seems like it should be fairly obvious...
Assistant: If you are using the Mac binary, I think the applications are in /web2py/web2py.app/Contents/Resources/applications/.
Note, you can also run the source version of web2py, in which case, the applications will be in /web2py/applications/.
