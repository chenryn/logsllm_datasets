So. I want to add a button on the label of RadioButton.  
For example, 'remove the option' button.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Expecting to be able to add MORE THAN JUST TEXT in the label of a radio...
## Current Behavior
Currently I replace the RadioButton with just a div, and cant add component
inside the label.  
Getting this message:
    input is a void element tag and must neither have `children` nor use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. create RadioButtonGroup
  2. create RadioButton inside it
  3. add RaisedButton to the label of the RadioButton.
  4. See '[object Object]' instead of the actual results.
