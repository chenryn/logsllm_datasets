### Title: Is This My Domain Controller? A New Class of Active Directory Protocol Injection Attacks

**Abstract:**

In the analysis of cryptographic system security, a critical aspect is resilience against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Over the years, researchers have successfully exploited many secure protocols using MitM attacks. A common theme in these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper validation for any of the communicating parties.

Focusing on Active Directory environments, the most common authentication protocols are Kerberos and NTLM. This presentation will review previous MitM attacks discovered in Active Directory authentication protocols and the mitigation strategies that have been implemented. We will demonstrate that the relay attack technique, traditionally associated with NTLM, can also be applied to the more recent Kerberos authentication protocol. Additionally, we will present several injection attacks that compromise client systems.

We will illustrate how the absence of proper validation can lead to severe issues, including authentication bypass and remote code execution on various critical infrastructure systems. These issues are not limited to on-premises Windows networks but extend to other infrastructures, such as domain-joined Unix machines, virtualization infrastructure, and even cloud directories like Azure AD.

The talk will provide a technical deep dive into multiple vulnerabilities we have discovered, accompanied by several demonstrations. These demos include a MitM attack that allows an attacker to inject user passwords in a hybrid AD environment, enabling the attacker to authenticate as any user in the network. We will also show how a similar technique can be used to take over an organization's virtualization infrastructure.

**Key Points:**
- **Review of Previous MitM Attacks:** Examination of past MitM attacks on Active Directory authentication protocols and their mitigation strategies.
- **New Attack Vectors:** Demonstration that the relay attack technique can be extended to Kerberos, not just NTLM.
- **Injection Attacks:** Presentation of various injection attacks that compromise client systems.
- **Impact of Validation Failures:** Illustration of how the lack of proper validation can lead to serious security issues, including authentication bypass and remote code execution.
- **Broader Impact:** Discussion of how these vulnerabilities affect not only on-premises Windows networks but also other infrastructures, such as Unix machines, virtualization, and cloud directories.
- **Technical Deep Dive:** Detailed exploration of the discovered vulnerabilities, supported by live demonstrations.

This session aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the new class of Active Directory protocol injection attacks and the steps necessary to mitigate them.
