### Building Python 2.6.4 on AIX 5.3

I encountered issues while trying to build Python 2.6.4 on AIX 5.3. I ran the `configure` script with the following options:

```sh
./configure --prefix=/home/chenf/python --disable-ipv6 --disable-shared --with-libs='/usr/lib/libncurses.a' --without-threads --disable-threads --with-ncurses=/utv/sad/ncurses/lib/libncurses.a
```

Despite my efforts to point the `configure` script to the correct location of `libncurses.a`, I still faced linking problems with `ncurses`. The `/usr/lib/libncurses.a` is a symbolic link to `/utv/sad/ncurses/lib/libncurses.a`, which exists and has no permission issues. There is also a symbolic link to this file in `/usr/local/lib`.

The `make` process produced the following errors, indicating that it could not find several `ncurses` symbols:

```sh

```

### Solution

Following Jed Smith's suggestions, I was able to resolve these issues. Here are the steps I took:

1. **Edit `Makefile.pre.in`**:
   - Replaced the line `CC=   @CC@` with `CC=   gcc` to force the use of `gcc` instead of the default compiler provided by AIX.

2. **Create a Symbolic Link for `ncurses.h`**:
   - Since `configure` could not find `ncurses.h` in `/opt/utv/sad/include/ncurses/`, I created a symbolic link in `/usr/include`:
     ```sh
     ln -s /utv/sad/ncurses/include/ncurses/ncurses.h /usr/include/ncurses.h
     ```

3. **Install GNU Binutils and GNU Make**:
   - Compiled and installed GNU binutils and GNU make, configuring them with the prefix `/home/chenf`:
     ```sh
     ./configure --prefix=/home/chenf
     ```
   - Added `/home/chenf/bin` to the beginning of the `PATH` to ensure the compilation process uses these tools:
     ```sh
     export PATH=/home/chenf/bin:$PATH
     ```

4. **Re-run `configure`**:
   - Executed the `configure` script with the following options:
     ```sh
     ./configure --prefix=/opt/freeware --disable-ipv6 --without-threads --with-ncurses=/opt/sad/ncurses
     ```
   - Disabled IPv6 and threads as they were causing compilation errors and were not needed.

5. **Build and Install**:
   - Ran `make` and `make install` to complete the build process.

### Compilation Errors and Missing Modules

During the compilation, I received some errors, and the build process failed to produce some modules (e.g., `math` and `datetime`). However, the core functionality of Python was successfully built and installed.

For now, I will proceed without the missing modules. If necessary, I can address those issues later.
