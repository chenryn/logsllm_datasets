Question: "In a post-incident analysis of a ransomware attack, it was discovered that the malware had the capability to stop or disable various services on the victims' systems. One of the proposed mitigation strategies includes restricting file and directory permissions. Which statement provides the best counterargument to the claim that this strategy alone would be sufficient to prevent service disruptions?"
 "A": "Restricting file and directory permissions does not prevent adversaries from using operating system APIs to stop services directly."
 "B": "Adversaries might avoid detection by intrusion detection systems even if file and directory permissions are restricted."
 "C": "Restricting file and directory permissions can inadvertently hinder legitimate user access and disrupt business operations."
 "D": "Network segmentation is the only effective mitigation strategy, making other strategies like restricting permissions redundant."
Answer: A
