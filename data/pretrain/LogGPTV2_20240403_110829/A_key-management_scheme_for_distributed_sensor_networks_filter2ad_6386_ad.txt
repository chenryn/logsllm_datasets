D. Complexity Analysis
The storage and communication overheads are shown in
Table V. In Table V, L denotes the length of session key, N
represents the length of noises in the vault, and s denotes the
polynomial degree. In PSKA, the sensors should send/receive
and store both the polynomial coefﬁcients and the vault (noise
numbers). In the proposed ECG-IJS scheme, the sensors only
need to store the polynomial coefﬁcients, and only a subset
of polynomial coefﬁcients are required to be sent
to the
receiver. Therefore, the proposed scheme signiﬁcantly reduces
the storage and communication overheads compared with
PSKA [8] algorithm as shown in Table V. The computation
analysis in Table VI focuses on the hash operations, asym-
metric/symmetric algorithms, polynomial operation and vault
generation for the proposed algorithm and PSKA [34]. ]. In
Table VI, m denotes the number of orthonormal pseudoran-
dom vectors, and n represents the number of features. The
PSKA protocol contains one hash, asymmetric and symmetric
operation, respectively, to compute the message digest code
with m + n (times) polynomial operation, one public-key
encryption to encrypt the sending message, and m + n (times)
vault generation to ensure the noises are different from the
polynomial coefﬁcients. In the proposed ECG-IJS scheme,
the m + n (times) computation for the vault generation is
not necessary because it does not use noises to hide the
session key. From Table V and VI, it is observed that that
the proposed ECG-IJS scheme has less overheads in terms of

Our major contribution of this paper is to innovatively apply
and adapt
the IJS algorithm to the data authentication in
WBANs. We summarized our major contributions in the paper.
”Firstly, we developed a new biometric-based approach to
authenticating the message communications in WBANs using
a lightweight manner. This approach can be implemented in
resource-constrained tiny body sensors; secondly, a novel key-
agreement scheme is designed to allow the sender and receiver
to share the same key without much communication over-
heads; last but not the least, compared to an existing PSKA
[8] authentication scheme using fuzzy vaults, our approach has
lower computational and communication overheads and higher
energy efﬁciency, which are highly required by resource-
limited body sensors. The experiment results also demonstrate
that our approach can achieve high security performance.
E. Security Analysis
In this section, we conduct the security analysis of the
proposed ECG-IJS approach. We focus on the three aspects:
data conﬁdentiality analysis, data authenticity and integrity
analysis, and security analysis.
(1) Data conﬁdentiality: Keeping data conﬁdentiality is to
prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individ-
uals. In ECG-IJS, the vector R which contains the coefﬁcients
of the monic polynomial, is public. However, without a similar
feature set, the attacker is not able to unlock the feature to
regenerate the key. Then, the data conﬁdentiality is satisﬁed.
(2) Data Authenticity and Integrity: Assuring data authen-
ticity and integrity is a process used to verify data integrity,
e.g., veriﬁcation that data received are identical to data sender,
or veriﬁcation that the data is not modiﬁed by attackers. In
ECG-IJS, a key agreement using Hash function (i.e., SHA-1,
SHA-2) ensures the authenticity and intercity. Either the data
is not sent from the sensor on the same person or the data
was modiﬁed, the key recovering would fail, which leads to
the failure of the authentication.
(3) Security analysis: The threats to WBSNs is primarily
from adversaries that are able to eavesdrop all the trafﬁc
within WBSNs, inject messages, replay old messages and
9
spoof node identities. Wireless medium is not trusted by the
sensors in WBSNs [1] due to its broadcast nature. However,
the adversaries cannot measure ECG signals and therefore
they do not directly know the keys being used. Because the
ECG-IJS scheme is proposed to keep data conﬁdentiality and
authenticity, other attacks such as Wormhole attack, sinkhole
attack and Sybil attack [10] are not discussed.
V. CONCLUSION
Secure communications in WBSNs are strongly required
to preserve a person’s health privacy and safety. Especially,
in some applications, security attacks could even threaten the
lives of people. In this paper, we present an improved Juels
and Sudan (IJS) scheme for key agreement, in which both
privacy and authenticity are preserved in an energy-efﬁcient
manner. Our major contributions in this paper incudes several
aspects: (1) the proposed ECG-IJS scheme can share a key in
energy-efﬁcient manner for WBSNs; (2) a novel hash-based
authentication approach using measured ECG signals at both
sender’s and receiver’s sites; (3) a framework for the security
analysis of WBSNs. In our proposed approach, ECG signals
are used as biometric to generate keys which are used in data
encryption and hash-based message authentication. Our studies
show that the proposed scheme is a lightweight and energy
efﬁcient security solution for WBSNs, which outperforms the
existing approaches. The performance of the ECG-IJS scheme
can be further improved by extracting more unique features for
individuals and by adopting the optimal vault size and optimal
difference tolerances.
