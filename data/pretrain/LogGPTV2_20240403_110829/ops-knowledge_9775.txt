Question: "What are the implications of Bitcoin's approach to not explicitly recording the balance of each user but instead recording every completed transaction in a public ledger? Select the correct statements."
 "A": "Recording transactions instead of balances increases transparency, as it allows any user to independently verify the validity of transactions."
 "B": "Not explicitly recording balances reduces the ledger's size, as only transactions are recorded, not the balance after each transaction."
 "C": "This approach eliminates the need for a trusted authority to manage and update user balances."
 "D": "Every transaction requires a verification process that is more computationally intensive than simply updating user balances."
Answer: ABCD
