User: Please write a Java application program to reverse and output a string.
Assistant: Here is the code for the Java application: ```java import java.util.Scanner; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print ("Please enter a string: "); String str = input.nextLine(); String reverseStr = reverse(str); System.out.printf("The reversed string is: %s", reverseStr); } public static String reverse(String str) { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(str); return sb.reverse().toString(); } } ``` The program first obtains the string entered by the user through the Scanner class, and then calls The reverse() method reverses the string and finally outputs the result. In the reverse() method, a StringBuilder object is first created, and the incoming string is passed to it as a parameter. Then call the reverse() method of the StringBuilder object to reverse the string, and finally convert the reversed string to the String type through the toString() method and return it.
