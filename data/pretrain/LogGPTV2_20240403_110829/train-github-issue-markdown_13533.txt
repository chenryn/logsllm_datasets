  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Please visit https://codesandbox.io/s/325y47xk36 for a code sample. It's a
basic implementation of a menu using https://react.semantic-ui.com.  
It creates a meta viewport as can be seen in the source code the rendered
page: ``  
The above fix was released in **semantic-ui-react v 0.76.0**.
## Current Behavior
`` is not
present.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Clone example with-semantic-ui
  2. Upgrade "semantic-ui-react": "^0.76.0" in package.json
  3. npm install
  4. npm run dev
## Context
meta viewport being added by semantic-react-ui gives the responsive character
to a lot of elements. Without this, any semantic app using semantic-ui-react
and next.js, we are missing responsiveness.
