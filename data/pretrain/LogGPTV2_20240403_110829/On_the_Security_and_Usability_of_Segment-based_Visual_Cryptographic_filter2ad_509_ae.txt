and uses the result to authenticate herself. Weinshall [35]
proposed Cognitive Authentication Scheme (CAS) that uti-
lizes human memory and cognition to diﬀerentiate two sets
of images. However, this scheme is later broken by Golle
and Wagner [17]. They used a SAT solver and recovered the

secret after intercepting challenge-response pairs of tens of
sessions.
Bai et al. proposed Predicated-based Authentication Ser-
vice (PAS) [8] in which the user and the server agree on a
predicate. During authentication, the server provides the
arguments as challenges and the user applies the predicate
to obtain the response. One year later, Li et al. [21] took
advantage of intersection attack to break this scheme.
Rosener et al. proposed GridCode [32] as a layer for obfus-
cating passcodes, but it was broken by Molloy and Li [24].
They were able to recover the victim’s password and addi-
tional secret after intercepting a small number of challenge-
response pairs.
Human Computable Machine Unbreakable (HCMU ) hash
schemes [10, 9] have been proposed for generating textual
passwords [10, 9]. Since they do not use any external mem-
ory aid (such as a key card in SVAPs), such schemes are harder
to design and to use. For example, the scheme in [10] re-
quires a human user to memorize a random mapping from
letters to digits, a random permutation of the digits, and to
perform single digit mod 10 additions.
Yan et al. [36] studied the inherent complexities of de-
signing authentication mechanisms that do not rely on the
underlying computing device. They consider those human-
computable authentication protocols that depend on the hu-
man users’ memory and cognitive capacity. They provide
two general classes of attacks that can circumvent these au-
thentication mechanisms. They also provide design princi-
ples for leakage-resilient password systems and described a
framework for measuring the cognitive overload of a proto-
col. Their framework and attacks are not directly applicable

a high-entropy secret.
Visual Cryptography (VC). Visual cryptography (VC ),
introduced by Naor and Shamir [26, 27], can be viewed as
an instance of human computable cryptography where de-
coding a ciphertext takes advantage of the visual channel
of a human user.
In this model, the ciphertext and the
secret key are printed images and revealing the plaintext
requires superimposing the two printed images (correspond-
ing to the ciphertext and the key) which user can visually
observe. Note that individually any of the printed images
(ciphertext or key) is indistinguishable from a random noise.
Ateniese et al. [6] and Lu et al. [22] considered VC-based
sharing scheme in a graph setting in which a secret image is
associated with each edge of the graph. The problem is to
generate shares for each vertex of the graph such that when
the shares of two distinct vertices v1 and v2 are combined, it
exposes the secret image corresponding to the edge (v1, v2).
Ateniese et al. [7] then proposed extended VC schemes that
allow the shares to be meaningful ﬁgures in order to avoid
suspicion and censorship. Rijmen and Preneel [31] ﬁrst pro-
posed a VC scheme to use diﬀerent colors other than black
and white. The same idea was later improved by Hou et
al. [19]. Chavan et al. [15] proposed hierarchical VC (HVC),
that can be used to derive more on-demand shares. Abboud
et al. [5] proposed to combine steganography and VC, but
their scheme requires the human computation to be more
involved.
Chang and Hu [13] proposed to use VC to distribute shares
of a copyright among its stakeholders. Watermark schemes
based on VC have also been proposed [20, 16]. VC can also
be used to generate voting receipts [14] that enjoy veriﬁabil-
ity and coercion resistance.
VC-based authentication. Noar and Pinkas [25] pro-
posed the ﬁrst framework for VC-based authentication and
identiﬁcation. Their Visual Identiﬁcation problem is simi-
lar to what we call Visual Authentication Mechanism. The
security notion we use for SVAPs in our paper is based on
the one in [25].
In the scheme they propose in [25], the
key consists of a number of squares, each is painted with
one of 10 colors. A challenge selects d squares, and the re-
sponse is the sequence of colors for the d squares, sent in
some predeﬁned order. Borchert’s note [12] discussed the
idea of segment-based VC which can be viewed as a spe-
cial case of SVAPs. However, in these schemes from each
challenge/response pair, an adversary can trivially recover a
portion of the key used in the pair.
9. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented an abstract framework for
designing SVAPs. We discussed two classes of protocols: uni-
symbol SVAPs and multi-symbol SVAPs. Then, we came up
with two attacks Search and SolveLP against them. Finally,
we carried out a user study to evaluate the usability of some
of the protocols.
Our overall ﬁndings are negative; our attacks can break
all the protocols we have developed including a commer-
cial protocol. This points to the following two fundamental
weaknesses of SVAPs. First, there is not enough entropy in
the secret key. Second, SVAPs are highly structured; they
do not eﬀectively enlarge the search space of the attack.
Therefore, it remains an open problem to design a secure
yet usable protocol based on visual cryptography.
