 zero bits during page scrubbing. The challenge here is to es-
timate the partial program time during scrubbing which de-
pends on the mean threshold voltage value of the original ze-
ros of the page. Hence the knowledge of page creation time 
and an accurate model for data retention characteristics of the 
memory chip will be critical to implement this method. 
Algorithm 2 explains the process of analog scrubbing, where 
we estimate the program time for analog  scrubbing process 
based on data retention information. Note that NAND flash 
has a default page program time tPROG of ~100-1000 µs. We 
first  select  a  block  where  some  data  has  been  stored  previ-
ously and select a page to be read. In this method, depending 
𝑝
on the data retention information, program time delay 𝑡𝑑
 is 
𝑝
defined  for  a  page  (𝑡𝑑
 ≤  tPROG).  Then  we  issue  the  NAND 
write  operation  to  implement  the  analog  scrubbing.  In  this 
case, some of the bit might not be programmed, so if the per-
cent  of  bit  programmed  is  less  than  97%,  this  process  will 
take  place  again  until  the  criteria  fulfills.  After  performing 
scrubbing in this way, difference between 0’s threshold volt-
age distribution is not noticeable, and an adversary is not able 
to recover the data from this page fully or partially.  
6. Implementation and Evaluation 
6.1 Experimental set-up 
A custom design hardware board is used in order to interface 
the commercial off the shelf flash chips with the computer. 
The board contains a socket to hold the flash chip under test 
and an FT2232H  (Future Technology Devices International 
Ltd) break-out board for USB communication. For the eval-
uation  purpose,  we  have  used  SLC  NAND  flash  memory 
chips from different flash manufacturers including Toshiba, 
Micron, and Samsung. The exact part number for all the chips 
used is listed in Table 1. 
6.2 Data Retrieval Efficiency after Scrubbing 
We evaluate the data recovery efficiency from a digitally san-
itized all zero page in Figure 5. The key parameter in the data 
recovery  process  is  the  precise  control  of  the  partial  erase 
time. If the duration of erasure is kept long, most of the bits 
will be erased (similar to standard block erase operation). On 
the flip side, if the erase duration is too small, then most of 
the bits will remain in zero states. Figure 5(a) illustrates the 
gradual data recovery process as a function of erase duration. 
For  a  clear  illustration,  we  plot  the  impact  of  partial  erase 
time on strong vs weak zeros separately in Figure 5(b). For 
complete recovery of the scrubbed image, it is required that 
all the weak zeros (zero bits of the original image) are con-
verted to ones while all the strong zeros (one bits of the orig-
inal image) remain at zero state. Due to overlap in the 𝑉𝑡 dis-
tribution of the strong vs weak zeros, a partial recovery of the 
original image is possible in practice. For example, in the Fig-
ure  5(b)  we  found  that  at  the  beginning  of  erase  operation 
weak zeros turned into ones much faster than the strong zeros.

Figure 5: (a) Illustration of bit accuracy of a recovered image vs partial erase time.  The image was scrubbed with zero-
overwrite method after 3 hours of bake at 120°C.  (b) For clear illustration, we plot the percentage of weak zeros that flipped 
into ones as well as the percentage of strong zeros that remained at zero state with respect to erase time.  
However, a significant percentage of strong zeros also flip to 
ones before all the weak zeros are flipped. Hence there is a 
narrow window of opportunity for the partial erase duration 
that ensures recovery of most of the original data. 
longer  the  bake  duration,  the  higher  the  bit  accuracy.  Note 
that the maximum bit accuracy of the recovered image corre-
sponding to different bake time is a function different partial 
erase duration.  
We define bit accuracy as a new metric for recovered image 
which measures the percentage of correctly identified bits of 
the original image data after partial erase operation. We find 
that there is an optimum erase duration that gives the highest 
bit  accuracy.  Please  note  that  a  completely  scrubbed  image 
(all zero bits or all one bits) will also have a bit accuracy ap-
proximately 50% assuming equal number of zeros and ones 
in the image. However, in order to recognize an image, the 
correctly  identified  positions  also  play  a  significant  role.  
Hence in Figure 5(a) we find that even though the bit accu-
racy of the recovered image is low for certain erase duration, 
the image is correctly recognizable. The other important point 
to note here is that the maximum bit accuracy is a function of 
data retention time or the storage history of the image.  Typ-
ically, the longer the duration of high temperature bake in our 
experiment (or older the stored data), the separation between 
𝑉𝑡  distribution  of  strong  vs  weak  zeros  will  be  wider.  This 
will increase the bit accuracy of the recovered image. In Fig-
ure 6 we plot the maximum bit accuracy of the recovered im-
age for different high temperature bake time. We find that the 
We  have  performed  the  evaluation  of  a  partial  erase  based 
image recovery on chips from different flash manufacturers 
and found that the partial erase method works for those chips 
which have longer block erase time.  The block erase time of 
NAND flash chip is defined in the datasheet by the manufac-
turer  i.e.  𝑡𝐸𝑅   and  typically  𝑡𝐸𝑅   varies  from  ~1-10  ms.  The 
longer the block erase time, it is easier to control the partial 
erase operation using the digital interface. Note that the par-
tial  erase  operation  is  implemented  using  our  measurement 
set-up as follows: we issue a block erase operation for a spec-
ified  NAND  block  and  then  we  issue  the  NAND  RESET 
𝑒). The 
(FFh) command after certain pre-defined time delay (𝑡𝑑
RESET command takes a finite time (few hundreds of micro-
seconds)  to  forcibly  terminate  the  erase  operation.  In  addi-
tion, the effective time for the pre-mature termination of erase 
operation depends on the delays associated with issuing com-
mands by the digital interface. Hence the minimum value of 
the partial erase duration is limited by the time corresponding 
to the RESET command and the delays associated  with the 
digital interface. For some of the chips as listed in Table 1,

discussed in Section 6.2) on the scrubbed image. The results 
are shown in Figure 7. We find that recovered image is diffi-
cult  to  be  identified  compared  to  the  fully  scrubbed  image. 
These  results  show  the  prospect  of  analog  scrubbing  tech-
nique for the true deletion of data. However, the accurate im-
plementation requires careful characterization of partial pro-
gram duration as a function of data retention time, which re-
mains a topic for future investigation.  
7.  Related Work on  NAND Sanitization  Meth-
ods 
In  this  section  we  provide  a  brief  overview  of  the  state-of-
the-art  sanitization  methods  for  NAND  flash  memory  sys-
tems. Since in-place updates are not possible in NAND flash, 
the  standard  multiple  overwrite-based  erasure  techniques, 
typically  used  for  hard  drives,  do  not  work  properly  for 
NAND storage system. Instead, following methods are typi-
cally employed by NAND controller for sanitization: 
•  Block  erase:  Block  erasure  method  is  a basic  NAND 
command to remove data from all the pages of a NAND 
block.  The  method  essentially  removes  electronic 
charge from the flash cells and hence physically erase 
the data from the NAND media. Typically, during gar-
bage collection process this method is used to remove 
old  invalid  data  once  the  drive  is  almost  full  [3]–[5]. 
Thus, this command is sparingly used by a NAND con-
troller.  However,  there  are  certain  sanitization  pro-
posals  which  use  this  command  for  secure  dele-
tion[14]–[16].  The  major  drawback  of  block  erasure 
based methods is the poor performance caused by the 
significant  valid  data  migration  overhead[16].  The 
other bottleneck for the frequent block erasure is the fi-
nite endurance limit of NAND flash technology. Thus, 
block  erasure  based  immediate  page  deletion  tech-
niques  are  not  a  practical  and  efficient  solution  for 
NAND storage.

we found that the minimum value of partial erase duration is 
comparable  to  the  block  erase  time,  and  hence  the  NAND 
block gets completely erased after the partial erase operation
