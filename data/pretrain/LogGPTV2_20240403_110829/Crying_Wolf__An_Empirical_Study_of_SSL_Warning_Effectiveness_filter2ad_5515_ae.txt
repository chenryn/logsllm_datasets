belonging to banks. If they do become fraud victims,
they are unlikely to pinpoint it to their decision to
ignore a warning. Thus users’ attitudes and beliefs
about SSL warnings are likely to undermine their ef-
fectiveness [3]. Therefore, the best avenue we have for
keeping users safe may be to avoid SSL warnings alto-
gether and really make decisions for users—blocking
them from unsafe situations and remaining silent in
safe situations.
5.1 Limitations
We did not attempt to measure any long term aﬀects
of habituation to warnings. Many participants were
likely to have previously seen the FF2 and IE7 warn-
ings, while few users were likely to have seen FF3
warnings as that browser was released just before the
study began. Our two warnings were new to all par-
ticipants. We expect users were more likely to ignore
the IE7 and FF2 warnings because of habituation,
but this is not supported by our data.
Several artifacts of the study design may have
caused participants to behave less securely than they
normally would. Our study participants knew in ad-
vance that they would be using their bank credentials
during the study and therefore the most security con-
scious potential participants may have decided not
to perform the study.
In addition, the study was
performed at and sanctioned by Carnegie Mellon,
and therefore participants may have trusted that the
study would not put their credentials at risk.
In our study, users were much less likely to heed
certiﬁcate warnings than in a previous study by
Schechter et al. that also examined user responses
to the IE7 certiﬁcate warning [17]. In our study 90%
of participants ignored the IE7 warning while in the
Schechter et al. study only 36% of participants who
used their own accounts ignored the IE7 warning. We
believe the diﬀerences may be due to the fact that in
the previous study participants were told the study
was about online banking, they performed four bank-
ing tasks prior to observing the warning, and they
were given two other clues that the website might be
insecure prior to the display of the warnings. The au-
thors state, “responses to these clues may have been
inﬂuenced by the presence of prior clues.” Further-
more, the previous study was conducted while IE7
was still in beta and thus users were less likely to
have seen the certiﬁcate warning before. In addition,
our study participants were more technically sophis-
ticated than the previous study’s participants.
5.2 Explain the Danger
The FF2, IE7, and our single page warnings take the
standard tactic of explaining the potential danger to
users. The FF2 warning, which is an unalarming
popup box with obscure language, prevented very few
users from visiting the bank or library. The IE7 warn-
ing, which has clearer language and a more frighten-
ing overall look, does not perform any better. On the
other hand, our single page warning, with its black
and red colors, was the most eﬀective of the ﬁve warn-
ings at preventing users from visiting the bank web-
site. In addition, only four users called the library,
indicating that our single-page warning would be only
a minor nuisance for legitimate websites. That said,
we suspect our single page warning would become less
eﬀective as users are habituated to it when visiting
legitimate websites.
5.3 Make it Diﬃcult
The FF3 warning, as discussed at length in Section
4.2.2, prevents user from visiting websites with in-
valid certiﬁcates by confusing users and making it
diﬃcult for them to ignore the warning. This im-
proves user behavior in risky situations like the bank
task, but it presents a signiﬁcant nuisance in safer
situations like the library task. Many legitimate web-
sites that use self-signed certiﬁcates have posted on-
line tutorials teaching users how to override the FF3
warning.12 We suspect that users who learn to use
the warning from these tutorials, by simple trial and
error, help from a friend, etc., will ignore subsequent
warnings and will be left both annoyed and unpro-
tected.

5.4 Ask a Question
Our multi-page warning, introduced in Section 4.1.2,
asks the user a question in order to collect contextual
information to allow the browser to better assess the
risk of letting the user proceed to the website. This
warning suﬀers from two usability problems: users
may answer incorrectly because they are confused
and users may knowingly answer incorrectly to get
around the warning. In addition, it leaves users sus-
ceptible to active attacks such as the ﬁner-grained
origins attacks [9]. These problems, plus the fact that
the single-page warning was more successful in pre-
venting users from visiting the bank website, lead us
to recommend against our multi-page warning as it
is currently implemented.
The multi-page warning depends on users correctly
answering our question, but only ﬁfteen of the 20 par-
ticipants answered correctly at the bank website. As
discussed in Section 4.2.2, we believe that ﬁve par-
ticipants either knowingly gave the wrong answer in
order to reach the destination website without inter-
ruption, or they confused the warning with a server
unavailable error. However, many users still made
mistakes even when answering our question correctly.
They behaved no more securely than users of our
single-page warning.
Users who answered our question correctly and fol-
lowed its advice would still be susceptible to ﬁner-
grained origins attacks. As brought to our attention
by an anonymous reviewer, an attacker with con-
trol over the network or DNS may circumvent the
multi-page warning by forcing the browser to connect
to a website other than the one the user intended.
For example, let’s say Alice goes to a webmail site
(www.mail.com), but an attacker controls the network
and wants to steal the password to her online bank
(www.bank.com).
When Alice visits mail.com, the attacker sends a
response to the Alice that forwards the browser to
https://www.bank.com/action.js. Then, the attacker
intercepts the connection to the bank with a self-
signed certiﬁcate, which triggers the warning shown
in Figure 4(a). The warning asks her what type of
website she is trying to reach and she answers “other”
because she believes she is visiting her webmail. Since
Even if Alice does not have an open session with
the bank, the browser’s cache will store the attack
script. Let’s say in its normal operation the bank
site loads its version of action.js after a user logs-in.
(If the site loads a diﬀerent script, then the attacker
simply poisons that script instead.) If Alice logs-into
www.bank.com in the next year, then the attacker’s
version of action.js will load instead of the bank’s ver-
sion. As in the attack in the previous paragraph, the
script steals her secure cookies. There are many other
variations on this attack, but they all rely on Alice
answering “what type of website are you trying to
visit” based on the site she believes she is visiting
instead of the site the attacker sends to her.
Designing an interface to collect contextual infor-
mation from users without making them susceptible
to active attacks such as those outlined above poses
a challenge. While we can ask users simple ques-
tions about their intentions that they are capable of
answering, we must be sure that attackers cannot in-
tervene to mislead users. We may be able to improve
the multi-page warning we proposed by asking users
another question in certain circumstances.
In par-
ticular, if the URL of the connecting website is sub-
stantially diﬀerent than the URL the user typed (or
clicked on, in the case of a link), then we would show
the URL of the connecting website and ask the user if
they intended to visit that URL. Unfortunately this
is not a complete solution for websites with mixed
content, like those using a third-party shopping cart
provider. In addition, the usability of such a solution
remains untested.
Alice answered “other” she is immediately forwarded
to action.js.
If Alice has an open session with the
bank, the attacker steals her bank.com secure cookies
with the script.
It remains an open research challenge to determine
how to leverage contextual information—including
user-provided information—in order to assess risks.
In particular, an approach is needed that is not vul-
nerable to confused users, users trying to get around
the system, or active attackers. It remains to be seen
whether it is feasible to design a robust approach
that uses user-provided information. Alternative ap-
proaches may leverage contextual information pro-
vided by sources other than the user.
5.5 Avoid Warnings
The ideal solution to SSL warning problems is to
block access when users are in true danger and al-
low users to proceed when they are not. This ideal is
probably unattainable, but two systems recently pre-
sented by the research community, ForceHTTPS [10]
and Perspectives [20] (and discussed in Section 2),
are steps in the right direction. Both systems iden-
tify websites likely to be unsafe and use warnings to
stop users from proceeding.
It would be better to
block these unsafe websites entirely. We expect both
systems to have extremely low false positive rates,
but further evaluation is required to know for sure.
Another possible way of identifying unsafe websites
is to maintain a list of websites that are veriﬁed by
a root certiﬁcate authority and block websites on the
list when the browser receives a self-signed certiﬁcate
instead.
