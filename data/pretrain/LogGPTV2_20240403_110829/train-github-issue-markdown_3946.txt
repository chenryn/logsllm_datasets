##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
yum
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
CentOS/RHEL Linux
##### SUMMARY
Currently the `yum` module has no functionality for handling checksums
(according to https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/yum_module.html). Thus,
if you want to check that a downloaded RPM has the expected checksum you need
to break it into a `get_url` and then a `yum` to install from the downloaded
artifact
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Currently:
    - name: Get RPM
      get_url:
        url: https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
        checksum: "md5:insertmd5sumhere"
        dest: /tmp/ius-release.rpm
    - name: Install downloaded rpm
       yum:
          name: /tmp/ius-release.rpm
          state: present
Proposed:
    - name: get and install RPM
      yum:
        url: https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
        checksum: "md5:insertmd5sumhere"
        state: present
