**Abstract:**
Most intrusion detection systems (IDS) employ the misuse detection approach, which compares recorded audit data with predefined patterns known as signatures. These signatures are typically developed based on empirical knowledge and expert experience, leading to long development times and extended vulnerability windows. To date, systematic methods for signature engineering and automated re-use of existing signatures have been limited. This paper introduces a systematic approach for engineering signatures by re-using existing ones, thereby optimizing the process and reducing development time.

## 1. Motivation

The increasing reliance on IT infrastructures and their complexity has heightened the potential for security threats. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a crucial role in detecting and mitigating these threats. IDSs use two complementary approaches: anomaly detection and misuse detection. Misuse detection focuses on identifying known attack patterns, or signatures, in audit trails. The effectiveness of misuse detection is heavily dependent on the precision and timeliness of the signatures used. Imprecise signatures can lead to false positives and reduce the overall detection capability of the IDS. The engineering of signatures, particularly from known exploits, is often a challenging and time-consuming process. This paper presents a method for deriving new signatures from existing ones, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of the signature engineering process.

## 2. Deriving Signatures by Re-use

### 2.1 Signature Transformations

A signature describes identifiable manifestations of an attack, characterized by the events that occur during the attack execution. These events leave traces in the audit trail. When re-using existing signatures to create new ones, it is essential to identify signatures that detect similar attack manifestations. Although each signature is specialized to detect a specific attack, they may share common features. The process of re-use involves abstracting from attack-specific elements by iteratively removing semantic features according to the signature specification language. This abstraction process enlarges the set of detectable attack manifestations.

### 2.2 Signature Abstraction Tree

The iterative application of transformations to a given signature \( S \) from a set \( K \) of existing signatures generates all possible abstracted signatures for \( S \). The relationships between the derived signatures can be represented by a signature abstraction tree, where \( S \) is the root node. Each direct child of \( S \) is an abstraction generated by applying a single transformation to \( S \). The tree structure indicates the degree of abstraction, with each abstracted signature accepting at least the manifestations accepted by \( S \).

**Example:**
- Transformation \( T_1 \) applied to \( S \) generates abstraction \( AS_1 \).
- Transformation \( T_3 \) applied to \( AS_1 \) generates abstraction \( AS_7 \).
- The manifestation sets must satisfy \( M_S \subseteq M_{AS_1} \subseteq M_{AS_7} \).

Identical nodes in the tree, representing identical signatures, can be removed along with their sub-trees to avoid redundancy.

## 3. Application to Snort Signatures

To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we apply it to the signature specification language of the Snort IDS. Snort is widely used and has a large, community-maintained signature knowledge base, making it an ideal test case. We describe the adaptation of our procedure to the Snort signature language and evaluate it using an official set of Snort-VRT Certified Rules.

## 4. Evaluation

We present the results of applying our approach in two examples, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating new signatures. The evaluation includes the correctness and conciseness of the derived signatures, as well as the reduction in development time.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work

In conclusion, our approach provides a systematic method for engineering new signatures by re-using existing ones. This method significantly reduces the time and effort required for signature development while improving the quality of the resulting signatures. Future work will focus on extending the approach to handle more complex, multi-step attacks and integrating it into existing IDS frameworks.
