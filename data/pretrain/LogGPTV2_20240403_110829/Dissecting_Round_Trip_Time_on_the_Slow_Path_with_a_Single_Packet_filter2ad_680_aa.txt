Abstract. Researchers and operators often measure Round Trip Time
when monitoring, troubleshooting, or otherwise assessing network paths.
However, because it combines all hops traversed along both the forward
and reverse path, it can be diﬃcult to interpret or to attribute delay to
particular path segments.
In this work, we present an approach using a single packet to dissect
the RTT in chunks mapped to speciﬁc portions of the path. Using the IP
Prespeciﬁed Timestamp option directed at intermediate routers, it pro-
vides RTT estimations along portions of the slow path. Using multiple
vantage points (116 PlanetLab nodes), we show that the proposed ap-
proach can be applied on more than 77% of the considered paths. Finally,
we present preliminary results for two use cases (home network contri-
bution to the RTT and per-Autonomous System RTT contribution) to
demonstrate its potential in practical scenarios.

Introduction and Motivation
A common metric used to estimate the delay over a network path is the Round
Trip Time (RTT) [1], deﬁned as the length of time it takes to send a data packet
toward a destination and receive its response. Monitoring RTT provides useful
information about the network status when managing testbeds and operational
networks [28]. However, an RTT sample comprises all the delays experienced
by the data packet and its response along the forward and reverse path respec-
tively, and it also includes the time the destination takes to inspect the incoming
packet and generate the proper response. As a consequence, it can be diﬃcult
to interpret RTT values or tease apart the contributing factors.
From this point of view, dissecting the RTT into chunks related to speciﬁc
portions of the network path may be helpful, making it possible to evaluate the
relative impact of each subpath on the total experienced RTT. This approach
is particularly useful in several scenarios. In a home network, one could isolate
the impact of the home network on the RTT experienced toward a destination
of interest, such as a website or network service. A large corporatation with
multiple providers may want to evaluate the impact of its access networks when
considering performance optimization and traﬃc engineering. Service providers
may be interested in assessing if the ISP of a particular user has a great impact
on the RTT, thus potentially representing the main cause of poor performance
perceived by the user.

Unfortunately, accurately dissecting RTT is not a trivial task, especially
through active measurements. One possibility is to rely on the RTTs reported
by traceroute, i.e. the time it takes to send the TTL-limited probe and receive
the ICMP Time Exceeded reply. However, it is not uncommon to observe RTT
of intermediate hops higher than the RTT of the destination, as reported in the
sample trace of Fig. 1(a)1. Another possibility is to use the ping command to
monitor both the RTT to an intermediate hop and to the destination. For exam-
ple, let us assume that our goal is to evaluate the impact of the provider, AS2907
(SINET-AS), on the RTT experienced toward the destination. We monitored the
RTTs up to the last hop within AS2907 (150.99.2.54) and the destination by is-
suing pairs of ICMP Echo Request packet probes closely in time with the ping
command. We launched one probe pair every 200 ms for 10 minutes and com-
puted the average RTT obtained in one second bins. Finally, we computed the
diﬀerence between the average RTT to the destination and to the intermediate
hop. Fig. 1(b) presents the results. For about half of the bins, the intermedi-
ate hop had an average RTT higher than the RTT of the destination, making
it hard to understand how the intermediate hop contributes to overall latency.
Preliminary analysis suggests the this problem holds even for sophisticated ping
variants that control RTT variance [21].
The inaccuracy of the two methods described above is determined by speciﬁc
factors: (i) due to path asymmetry [12], the intermediate hop may not be part
of the reverse path from the destination, thus its RTT is not part of the RTT
of the destination; (ii) the two RTT samples are obtained by employing two
distinct packet probes that potentially experience diﬀerent network conditions
or paths;2 (iii) the two solicited devices may require a diﬀerent amount of time
to inspect the probe and generate the response [11]; ﬁnally (iv) when using ping,
the forward path up to the intermediate hop may not represent a subpath of the
forward path toward the destination, since fowarding is destination-based.
1 This forward path is stable and unique, according to paris-traceroute [2].
2 For example, due to load balancers located along the reverse paths [2].

In this work, we introduce a new approach to dissect the RTT experienced to-
ward a given destination into two distinct chunks, using a single purposely crafted
probe packet to avoid the complications introduced in the previous paragraph.
Our approach uses the IP Timestamp option and needs an intermediate router
that honors the option and appears on both the forward and reverse paths. In
these cases, the technique dissects the RTT into (a) the time the probe spends
between the source and an intermediate router (in both directions) and (b) the
time the probe spends between the intermediate router and the destination (in
both directions). While our approach requires a preliminary phase to identify
compliant intermediate routers, it uses only widely adopted network diagnostic
tools such as traceroute and ping.
Using multiple vantage points (116 PlanetLab nodes), we provide experimen-
tal results about the degree of applicability of our approach as well as case studies
demonstrating its utility in practical scenarios.
2 Dissecting Round Trip Time
In this section, after a brief recap of the IP Prespeciﬁed Timestamp option, we
describe the approach we propose to dissect the RTT in chunks.
Background. Although IP options headers [22] are not universally supported
on the Internet [5, 9], researchers have used them as the basis for a number of
recent measurement techniques [8, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 25, 26]. In this work, we use
the IP Prespeciﬁed Timestamp option [22] (hereafter TS option) to dissect the
RTT. This option lets the sender specify up to four IP addresses in the header
of the packet, to request timestamps from the corresponding routers. We adopt
(cid:2)
(cid:2)ABCD refers to an ICMP Echo
the notation proposed by Sherry at al. [25]: X
Request packet where X is the targeted destination and ABCD is the ordered
list of prespeciﬁed IPs from which a timestamp is requested. Note that the
position of each prespeciﬁed address in the ordered list ABCD is essential since
it implies that B cannot insert its own timestamp before A, C before B, and so
on. Typically, when the packets are not ﬁltered along the path [9], the incoming
option is replicated by the destination inside the ICMP Echo Reply. The TS
option has been used to infer aliases [19, 25], to infer routers statistics such as
traﬃc shape and CPU load [8], to identify third-party addresses and hidden
routers in traceroute trace [17,20], to reconstruct reverse paths [14], to infer link
latency [24], and to identify symmetric link traversal [15].
Dissecting RTT. Our approach makes it possible to dissect the RTT toward
a destination that (i) provides at least one timestamp when probed with D
(cid:2)
(cid:2)DDDD and (ii) is not an extra-stamper [25], i.e. it does not provide more than
(cid:2)
(cid:2)DXXX where X is an IP address surely
one timestamp when probed with D
not involved on the traversed path. On these paths, we can dissect the RTT
into chunks by exploiting a compliant router located along the path (see Fig. 2):
a compliant node W (i) is part of both the forward and reverse path under
investigation; (ii) honors the TS option and provides standard timestamps [22],

with
i.e milliseconds since midnight UT; (iii) provides timestamps both on the forward
and reverse path. Hereafter we adopt the following notation: RTTS,D(X, Y) is
the time taken by probes sent from the source S to the destination D to travel
from X to Y on the forward path and from Y to X on the reverse path. This
is a portion of the RTT of the entire path, i.e. RTTS,D(S, D).
Let W be a compliant node between the source S and the destination D.
Besides RTTS,D(S, D), our approach estimates RTTS,D(S, W) and RTTS,D(W,

D) by using the same single-packet probe. To this end, we send a D
probe from S to D. Once S receives the reply, six timestamps are available:
(a) the sending and receiving time at the source (TS1 and TS2); (b) the times-
tamp provided by W along the forward (TW 1) and reverse path (TW 2); (c) the
two timestamps provided by the targeted destination D (TD1 and TD2). These
timestamps allow us to easily compute the RTT chunks (see Fig. 3 as refer-
ence): RTTS,D(S, D) as TS2-TS1, RTTS,D(W, D) as TW 2-TW 1 and RTTS,D(S,
W) as RTTS,D(S, D)-RTTS,D(W, D) .3 When the destination provides only one

The Slow Path. Packets can traverse a router either through the fast (hard-
ware) or the slow (route processor/software) path. The IP option on our probes
causes routers to inspect them and process them on the slow path. Previous work
showed that IP options traﬃc experiences higher RTT, jitter, and packet loss,
3 Note how it would be possible to estimate also several one way delays: from S to
D (TD1-TS1), D to S (TS2-TD2), S to W (TW 1-TS1), W to D (TD1-TW 1), D to
W (TW 2-TD2) and W to S (TS2-TW 2). However, unlike the RTT considered in this
paper, one way delays are potentially biased if clocks at the various nodes are not
properly synchronized, a common case in the Internet.

compared to traﬃc without IP options [10]. Ferguson et al. [8] recently observed
that the processing time of packets with the TS option depends on the status
of the router (traﬃc and CPU load). Accordingly, the estimated RTTs provide
insight into the current condition of network links and routers, a diﬀerent view
of network path performance.
Accuracy Concerns. Concerns about the accuracy of the estimated RTTs may
arise since we exploit timestamps provided by distinct network nodes potentially
not synchronized. However, we compute each RTT using only the timestamps
provided by a single router’s clock. Accordingly, any clock oﬀsets do not aﬀect
the estimated RTTs. Our measurements are subject to local clock drift, but we
assume this impact is negligible over the short duration of a typical RTT.
