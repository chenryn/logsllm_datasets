Assistant: Between 2005-07-09 17:51:44 and 21:02:14, the kernel generated several cores (16095, 7183, 1988, 2347, 2790, 2573, 3985, 13592, 10019, 10842, 8138, 32657, 26835, 28242, 20970, 18514, and 19321). Additionally, there were three double-hummer alignment exceptions (1365301360, 1315337824, and 1401390016).
