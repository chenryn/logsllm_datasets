User:  When dealing with large-scale data, how to perform data fragmentation and load balancing? Please list common solutions.
Assistant: Data sharding and load balancing are two very important aspects in large-scale data processing. Common schemes are listed below: 1. Data sharding scheme: (1) Horizontal sharding: Shard data according to a certain dimension, such as sharding by user ID, and divide data with similar user IDs into the same share. (2) Vertical sharding: Shard the data according to the columns in the table structure, for example, separate the more important data in a row of data, and divide other field data into different shards. (3) Distributed data sharding: It is realized by splitting large-scale data into multiple distributed blocks and distributing these blocks on multiple physical and virtual machines. 2. Load balancing scheme: (1) Hardware-based load balancing: use hardware devices (such as load balancers) to distribute requests and make multiple servers load evenly. (2) DNS load balancing: By using DNS domain name resolvers, requests are distributed among servers, and multiple servers are evenly loaded. (3) Software load balancing: By using software for load balancing and distributing multiple requests to different servers, to ensure the average load of multiple servers. Commonly used software includes HAProxy and Nginx.
