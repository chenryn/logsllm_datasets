Table 6 shows details of the replies that caused destinations to be reached using the UDP-Paris, TCP port 80, and ICMP-Paris methods from cbg-uk. The expected type of reply from a UDP-Paris traceroute is an ICMP port unreachable message; 96.0% of the replies classified as reaching the destination were of this type for this method. The expected type of reply packet for a TCP port 80 traceroute is a TCP SYN/ACK or RST/ACK packet, depending on whether a service is listening on the destination port; 94.6% of the replies classified as reaching the destination were of this type for this method. The expected type of reply packet for an ICMP-Paris traceroute is an ICMP echo reply packet; 98.8% of the replies classified as reaching the destination were of this type for this method.

Table 6 excludes ICMP time exceeded replies with a source address matching the destination probed. In such cases, when a reply was received by scamper, it continued probing until there was a reason to halt, in order to determine if the destination might be reached with further probes. Table 7 shows the results of further probing. The ICMP-Paris method is much more likely to then obtain an ICMP echo reply message (40.0%) than UDP-Paris is to obtain an ICMP port unreachable message (11.2%) in this scenario. Of the remaining ICMP destination unreachable messages received, all had a source address matching the destination address probed.

### Spoofed Replies

Since we use multiple methods to infer forward IP paths to each destination, we can use the combined information to implicate some replies as spoofed. For UDP traceroute methods, an ICMP port unreachable message should be sent by a destination host when the datagram cannot be delivered because the indicated port is not running an active process [23]. The port unreachable message may be from an address of a different interface on the same host as the destination address of the triggering packet; in fact, this artifact is used as a heuristic in alias resolution [24, 25]. However, if the source address of a port unreachable message in one IP path is also observed in a time exceeded message in one of the other IP paths to that destination, and at least one other time exceeded message follows from an address other than the destination’s, then the port unreachable is inferred as not sent by the destination, since the pair of time exceeded messages in the second path indicate the destination has still not been reached. Of the 12,875 destinations considered reached using the UDP-Paris method from cbg-uk based on an ICMP port unreachable response, 27 are inferred to be from an intermediate host rather than the destination itself. Although arguably negligible, this result does demonstrate that intermediate systems do send port unreachable messages on a destination’s behalf, which can lead to false alias resolution and false inference of reachability—reachability that was previously thought to be unambiguous [11].

Similarly, if one method reveals an IP path to E of A B C D E, while a second method reveals a path of A B E, it is likely that the reply allegedly from E in A B E is spoofed, as this path suggests B and E are neighbors, while the presence of D in the first path rules out the possibility that C is merely an alias of E. Since a router should always prefer a directly connected path, we would not expect to see C and D in the middle of two neighbors (B and E) using any method—hence we conclude that B and E are not really neighbors and in the second method some other host is spoofing replies using E’s address.

Of the 21,576 destinations that were classified as reached using the TCP method from cbg-uk, we used this reasoning to infer 221 replies that were spoofed. Of these, 158 replies were SYN/ACK packets, 61 were RST/ACK packets, and two were time exceeded messages. The TCP packets indicate the presence of an application-level gateway early in the path; because these replies are spoofed at least two hops prior to the destination, the TCP method will miss potentially valuable IP links at the edge of the network. In addition, because of our conservative requirement to visit at least two additional hops from a common parent hop before inferring a reply as spoofed, these values are likely lower bounds of spoofing activity. The other methods were inferred to spoof much less; with the UDP-Paris method, 41 messages purporting to be from the destination were received, while there were only 14 such messages with the ICMP-Paris method.

### Firewall Placement

Related to the problem of reachability is the detection of firewalls along the probed path. Figure 3 shows the additional hops discovered by cbg-uk when one probe method reaches a destination but another does not, either because an ICMP destination unreachable message was sent, or because no reply was received for five consecutive hops. In all cases in which one method reaches a destination but another fails, the most common number of additional hops discovered, including the destination, is two. However, this distribution of additional hops is long-tailed; in most cases, the number of additional hops discovered does not level out until after seven.

### Last-Ditch Probing

When five consecutive unresponsive hops were encountered, traceroute halted due to the gaplimit condition. In this condition, we send up to two last-ditch probes with an IP TTL of 255 to determine if there is anything further in the path that may have responded if hop-by-hop probing had continued. Table 8 shows the response rate to the last-ditch probes and classifies the types of responses received for three probe methods at cbg-uk. Overall, the last-ditch probes have a low response rate, although the last-ditch response rate to the TCP method is 1.7 times that of the UDP-Paris method.

### Similarity of Observed Paths

This section considers the similarity of paths collected by each method for all vantage points. Pervasive deployment of load balancing [15] implies expected variation in IP paths collected to each destination. Figure 4 shows the uniqueness of a subset of paths captured at each vantage point for which the destination was reached and all intermediate hops inferred for all three probe methods. The total number of complete paths considered depends on the vantage point; bcn-es had the fewest considered with 1,732, while syd-au had the most with 7,814. In our data, the vantage point has more impact on the number of complete IP paths than the probe method does. As roughly the same number of destinations were reached from each vantage point, the variation is mostly due to the prevalence of unresponsive hops unique to each vantage point.

Figure 4 also suggests that the uniqueness of the paths depends mostly on the vantage point and the forwarding policies of its upstream paths. For example, the number of traces where the same IP path was inferred by all three methods ranges from 2.5% at nrt-jp to 48.3% at syd-au. While there is significant variance among vantage points, one trend emerges. Of the IP paths that were not the same for all three methods, the largest intersection is between the ICMP-Paris and TCP methods for all vantage points except nrt-jp. If per-flow load balancing were applied equally to TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets, the distribution of dissimilar paths would be equal across the three techniques.

Figure 5 shows the intersection of IP links per method for each vantage point. Depending on the vantage point, between 238k and 266k IP links were inferred, with 76% to 78% of the IP links inferred by all three probe methods. Despite reaching the fewest destinations, UDP-Paris allows inference of more links than any other method, while ICMP-Paris allows inference of the most links that are not inferred by the other methods. 97% of IP links are inferred by combining ICMP-Paris and UDP-Paris. The fact that TCP infers the fewest links reinforces the earlier result where application-level gateways are inferred to intercept TCP connection requests at a greater rate, and tends to suggest some routers may have different forwarding policies depending on the transport protocol. We explore this further in Section 3.1.7.

Figure 6 shows the intersection of AS links inferred from each vantage point. Depending on the vantage point, between 17,461 and 18,065 unique AS links were inferred using the three methods, with 82% in common across the three methods. While UDP-Paris inferred the greatest number of IP links, it inferred the fewest AS links, suggesting that most of the additional IP links inferred with UDP-Paris are internal to the ASes inferred. The IP links UDP-Paris misses are likely internal to the ASes.
