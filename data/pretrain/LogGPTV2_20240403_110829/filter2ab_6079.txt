**ATT&CK ID:** S0559  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** SUNBURST

SUNBURST created an Image File Execution Options (IFEO) Debugger registry value for the `dllhost.exe` process. This modification was designed to trigger the installation of Cobalt Strike when `dllhost.exe` was executed.[10]

### Explanation:
- **Image File Execution Options (IFEO):** This is a feature in Windows that allows developers and administrators to attach a debugger to a specific executable. In this case, SUNBURST used IFEO to specify a debugger for `dllhost.exe`.
- **Cobalt Strike:** A legitimate penetration testing tool that attackers often misuse for malicious purposes. By setting up the IFEO, SUNBURST ensured that Cobalt Strike would be installed and executed when `dllhost.exe` ran.

This approach allowed the attackers to maintain persistence and execute their payload in a stealthy manner.
