## Overview
This presentation discusses the discovery of a more potent variant of the Evil Twin attack, which we call 'Multipot'. The key topics covered include:
- Recap of the Evil Twin attack.
- Fundamentals of the Multipot threat.
- Technical details of the Multipot threat.
- Why traditional defenses against Evil Twin attacks are ineffective against Multipot.
- Threat scenarios arising from Multipot.
- A demonstration of the Multipot threat.

## Evil Twin - Recap
- **Attack Method:** An attacker sets up an Access Point (AP) with a spoofed Service Set Identifier (SSID).
- **Client Lure:** The client is lured into connecting to the attacker's AP.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attacker becomes a MitM, intercepting and potentially altering the communication.
- **Prevalence:** This threat is common in hotspots, homes, and campuses.

## Known Countermeasures
- **Established Attack Tools:** KARMA, delegated, hotspotter, Monkey Jack, and more.
- **Level 1 Defense:** Prevent the client from being lured.
  - Examples: Watchful users, Layer 2 mutual authentication, preprogrammed list of legitimate AP MAC addresses.
- **Level 2 Defense:** Use a Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) to contain wireless sessions to the Evil Twin.
  - **Session Containment:** Commonly achieved via spoofed deauthentication (deauth) packets from a WIPS sensor.
  - **Limitations:** Not foolproof and not always practical.

## Multipot - A More Potent Variant
- **Multiple APs as Evil Twins:** Multiple APs with identical SSIDs feed data into a common endpoint.
- **Client Hopping:** If one AP is contained by WIPS, the client "hops" to another AP in the Multipot, continuing communication.
- **Ineffectiveness of Deauth:** Traditional deauth-based session containment becomes ineffective.

### Multipot in Action
- **Client Communication:** The client communicates without major disruption even with session containment.
- **Threat Analysis:**
  - **Sensor Behavior:**
    - WIPS sensors detect and deauth client connections after a finite delay.
    - Sensors need to operate on multiple 802.11 channels to detect unauthorized communication.
    - Channel scanning and processing delays are unavoidable, typically ranging from 1 second to 10 seconds.
  - **Client Behavior:**
    - 802.11 clients reassociate after receiving a deauth packet.
    - Reassociation involves probe, authentication, and association phases.
    - Vendors implement different heuristics, some using aggressive reconnection schemes.
    - Reassociation latency measurements show that some clients, like Centrino and Cisco Aironet 350, can reassociate in as little as 30 ms.

### Summary
- **Cat and Mouse Game:** WIPS sensors get trapped due to inherent time disparities.
- **Client Resilience:** Clients, such as Centrino and Cisco Aironet 350, swiftly connect to new APs after disconnection.
- **Ineffective Countermeasures:**
  - Deauth-based session containment is not effective for Multipots due to association hopping.
  - Client-side software and wire-side prevention (e.g., switch port disabling) are insufficient.

### Threat Scenarios
1. **Naturally Occurring Habitat:**
   - **Enterprise/Campus Network:** Policies against clients connecting to public or open neighbor APs.
   - **Multiple APs with Identical SSIDs:** Naturally present, creating a Multipot.
   - **Failure of WIPS:** Traditional WIPS session containment fails to stop non-policy compliant connections.
   
2. **Handcrafted Variants:**
   - **Public Hotspot Scenario:** Multipots can be handcrafted with malicious intentions.
   - **Attacker Setup:** Once a client connects to the Multipot, the attacker can perform various MitM attacks using tools like KARMA and hotspotter.
   - **WIPS Ineffectiveness:** Traditional WIPS countermeasures fail to defend against such attackers.

### Related Works
- **Joshua Wright (May 2005):** Concluded that session containment can be valuable but comes with risks, including evasion.
- **DARPA and Department of Homeland Security Project MAP:** Aimed at developing defenses against wireless-based attacks, recognizing the potential for evasive techniques.

### Demonstration
- **Setup:**
  - Testbed: Centrino WiFi client, laptop-based sensor, and Multipot with SSID=XYZ.
  - Victim client will hop between APs in response to deauth session containment.
  - Ping traffic will progress well when both APs in the Multipot are active and the sensor is chasing the connection.
