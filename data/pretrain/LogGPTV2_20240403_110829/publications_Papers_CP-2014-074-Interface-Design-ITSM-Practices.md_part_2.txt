Coupling: In terms of service coupling “the objective is to

processes as independent as possible by not having any
knowledge of, or relying on, any other business processes”
[10].This overlaps with the definition of discrete process used Figure 2. Fry's five key questions

It should be noticed that when doing so, in the case of the ITIL

further and identify activities more granularly than those

case, the person designing the process should carefully decide
upon such cases it might make sense to leave the process
