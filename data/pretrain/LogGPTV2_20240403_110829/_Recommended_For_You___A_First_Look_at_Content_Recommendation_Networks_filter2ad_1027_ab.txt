Table 2: Number of CRNs used by publishers

relationship between ads and advertisers, and ﬁnally we
examine the content that is advertised via CRNs.
4.1 High-Level Statistics
We begin by presenting a broad overview of our ﬁve
target CRNs in Table 1. As expected, Outbrain and
Taboola are embedded in an order-of-magnitude more
publishers than their smaller competitors. We also see
that only 334 of our 500 publishers have embedded wid-
gets from CRNs, and yet all 500 request at least one
resource from a CRN (see § 3.1). The 166 missing pub-
lishers include trackers from CRNs, but do not embed
recommendation widgets in their pages.
Table 1 shows the total number of ads (i.e., recom-
mendations sponsored by third-parties) and recommen-
dations we observe from each CRN, as well as average
ads and recommendations per page. Four of the CRNs
serve more ads than recommendations; ZergNet is a spe-
cial case, since it only serves ads. Outbrain serves 1.5×
more ads per page than recommendations on average,
while Taboola and Revcontent serve 5× more ads on
average. Gravity is the sole exception to this trend:
we observe 2.7× more recommendations from Gravity
overall, and only ∼1 ad per page.
Interestingly, we observe cases where a given pub-
lisher will embed widgets from competing CRNs into
their website. As shown in Table 2, this situation is rel-
atively rare: only 36 publishers use ≥ 2 CRNs. The
Huﬃngton Post actually embeds widgets from Out-
brain, Taboola, Gravity, and Revcontent. Publishers
with multiple CRN widgets may be attempting to cap-
ture additional revenue by presenting users with more
ads, or the publisher may be conducting an A/B test to
compare revenue from competing CRNs.
Mixed Recommendations.
Most of the CRN
widgets in our dataset include ads or recommendations.
This makes sense from a user interface perspective: mix-
ing sponsored and organic recommendations in a single
container may confuse users. However, 11.9% of CRN
widgets in our dataset do not behave this way: the “%

Table 3: Top-10 headlines used for labeling rec-
ommendation and ad widgets.
Mixed” column in Table 1 shows the percentage of wid-
gets from each CRN that include ads and recommenda-
tions. We observe that Taboola, Outbrain, and Gravity
all allow publishers to mix ads and recommendations
inside a single widget, with 26% of Gravity widgets be-
having this way.
We manually examined the widgets with mixed rec-
ommendations and found that it was often unclear
which links were ads.
In some cases, the ads have a
small icon next to them that links to a disclosure (simi-
lar to the AdChoices
icon). In other cases, the target
of each link is stated in parenthesis (see Figure 2 for an
example), which explicitly informs the user that the link
directs to a third-party, but does not explicitly inform
the user that the link is a paid promotion.
4.2 Headlines and Disclosures
Our observations about widgets with mixed recom-
mendations leads directly to our next set of questions:
are CRNs explicitly labeling sponsored links as adver-
tisements? To investigate this issue, we examine the
headlines and disclosures in CRN widgets.
Headlines.
Overall, we observe that 88% of CRN
widgets have headlines. Of those that do not, 11% con-
tain ads. Table 3 shows the top-10 most common head-
lines for recommendation and ad widgets3, as well as
the percentage of widgets with those headlines. Sur-
prisingly, three of the top-10 headlines are identical for
recommendation and ad widgets, and none of the three
explicitly state that the links may be advertisements.
The most common ad widget headline also does not in-
3Many widgets have headlines that diﬀer by exactly one word,
e.g., “You May Like” and “You Might Like”. We cluster these
headlines together in Table 3.

dicate the presence of sponsored links. Across all head-
lines for ad widgets, only 12% include the word “pro-
moted”, 2% include “partner”, 1% include “sponsored”,
and 50% of ads from Outbrain are
contextually targeted, with the Money topic seeing the
heaviest targeting.
We observe similar trends for Taboola: all topics see
>50% contextually targeted ads, with the Sports topic
leading with 64%. We omit these results for brevity.
Location.
Second, we investigate whether Out-
brain and Taboola target ads based on location. To
examine this, we used the Hide My Ass! VPN service
to obtain IP addresses in nine major American cities.
Using these IPs, we recrawled the 10 political articles
we previously selected on all eight top-publishers (we
focus on a single topic to control for contextual eﬀects).
As before, all 80 pages were refreshed three times.
Figure 4 shows the fraction of ads from Outbrain that
are targeted based on location on each publisher, as well
as averaged across publishers for a subset of our loca-
tions. We observe that only ∼20% of ads are location-
dependent, with BBC being the exception; we hypothe-
size that this may be due to the international nature of
their audience. For Taboola, we observe slighlty higher

These results agree with prior work showing that lo-
cation has a relatively minor impact on online display
ads [2, 10].
4.4 Down the Funnel
In this section, we analyze the advertising funnel,
starting with ads themselves, and ending with the pages
that users are brought to after clicking on the ads.
We begin by examining the uniqueness of ads served
by CRNs. The “All Ads” line in Figure 5 shows the
distribution of publishers per ad URL in our dataset,
i.e., on how many publishers did a given ad URL ap-
pear on? Of the 131K total ad URLs in our dataset,
94% only appear on a single publisher, i.e., they are
