### 4.1 High-Level Statistics

We start with a broad overview of our five target CRNs, as shown in Table 1. As expected, Outbrain and Taboola are embedded in an order of magnitude more publishers than their smaller competitors. We also observe that only 334 out of our 500 publishers have embedded widgets from CRNs, while all 500 publishers request at least one resource from a CRN (see ยง 3.1). The 166 missing publishers include trackers from CRNs but do not embed recommendation widgets on their pages.

Table 1 provides the total number of ads (i.e., third-party sponsored recommendations) and recommendations observed from each CRN, along with the average ads and recommendations per page. Four of the CRNs serve more ads than recommendations; ZergNet is a special case, as it only serves ads. Outbrain serves 1.5 times more ads per page than recommendations on average, while Taboola and Revcontent serve 5 times more ads on average. Gravity is the exception, with 2.7 times more recommendations overall and approximately 1 ad per page.

Interestingly, we find instances where a publisher embeds widgets from competing CRNs into their website. As shown in Table 2, this situation is relatively rare, with only 36 publishers using two or more CRNs. The Huffington Post, for example, embeds widgets from Outbrain, Taboola, Gravity, and Revcontent. Publishers with multiple CRN widgets may be attempting to capture additional revenue by presenting users with more ads or conducting A/B tests to compare revenue from competing CRNs.

### 4.2 Headlines and Disclosures

Our observations about widgets with mixed recommendations lead to the next set of questions: are CRNs explicitly labeling sponsored links as advertisements? To investigate this, we examine the headlines and disclosures in CRN widgets.

#### Headlines

Overall, 88% of CRN widgets have headlines. Of those without, 11% contain ads. Table 3 shows the top-10 most common headlines for recommendation and ad widgets, along with the percentage of widgets with those headlines. Surprisingly, three of the top-10 headlines are identical for both recommendation and ad widgets, and none explicitly state that the links may be advertisements. The most common ad widget headline does not indicate the presence of sponsored links. Across all ad widget headlines, only 12% include the word "promoted," 2% include "partner," and 1% include "sponsored."

### 4.3 Contextual and Location-Based Targeting

#### Contextual Ads

For Outbrain, 50% of ads are contextually targeted, with the Money topic seeing the heaviest targeting. Similar trends are observed for Taboola, with all topics seeing >50% contextually targeted ads, and the Sports topic leading with 64%.

#### Location-Based Ads

To investigate whether Outbrain and Taboola target ads based on location, we used the Hide My Ass! VPN service to obtain IP addresses in nine major American cities. Using these IPs, we recrawled the 10 political articles previously selected on all eight top publishers. All 80 pages were refreshed three times.

Figure 4 shows the fraction of ads from Outbrain that are targeted based on location for each publisher and averaged across publishers for a subset of locations. Only about 20% of ads are location-dependent, with BBC being the exception, possibly due to its international audience. For Taboola, we observe slightly higher (about 26%) location-dependent ads. These results align with prior work showing that location has a relatively minor impact on online display ads [2, 10].

### 4.4 Down the Funnel

In this section, we analyze the advertising funnel, starting with the ads themselves and ending with the landing pages after ad clicks.

#### Uniqueness of Ads

The "All Ads" line in Figure 5 shows the distribution of publishers per ad URL in our dataset. Of the 131K total ad URLs, 94% appear on a single publisher, indicating high uniqueness.

#### Age and Popularity of Landing Domains

Figures 6 and 7 show the age of landing domains based on Whois records and their Alexa ranks, respectively. These figures provide insights into the maturity and popularity of the landing pages.

By examining these aspects, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the CRN ecosystem, from the initial ad placement to the final user experience.
