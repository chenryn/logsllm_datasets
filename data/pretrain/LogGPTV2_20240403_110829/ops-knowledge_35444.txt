User: How to realize the system monitoring of Linux server, including CPU, memory, disk and other indicators?
Assistant: To realize the system monitoring of the Linux server, the following methods can be adopted: 1. Use the command line tools that come with the system: There are many command line tools in Linux that can be used to monitor various system indicators. Such as top, htop, free, vmstat and so on. You can run these commands from the command line to obtain system status information. 2. Use third-party monitoring tools: such as Nagios, Zabbix, Cacti, etc. These tools can monitor multiple servers and various indicators, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, etc. The corresponding monitoring agent needs to be installed and configured on the server. 3. Use the monitoring services of cloud service providers: For example, the monitoring services provided by cloud service providers such as AWS's CloudWatch and Azure's Monitor can monitor the performance and availability of various applications, networks and infrastructure. The Linux server needs to be configured as the monitoring target of CloudWatch or Monitor, and then managed and monitored on the console. 4. Write your own monitoring program: You can write your own monitoring program, use the system call of the Linux kernel or use a third-party library to obtain system information. The self-written program can customize the monitoring indicators and alarm rules according to the needs.
