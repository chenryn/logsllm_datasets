User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Forward systemd journal messages/Collect systemd journal messages How can I collect systemd journal events (pull) or forward systemd journal events (push)?

I want to have something like forwarded event log (http://windows.tips.net/T012878_What_is_the_Purpose_of_the_Forwarded_Events_Event_Log.html) but under Linux.

I'm using ArchLinux but not sure this matters.

Should I forward journal to syslog and then collect syslog? Will I loose any info by doing so? Can I collect journal messages without syslog daemon?

Assistant: Forwarding messages to legacy software like syslog gives you nothing but overhead.

Instead you can implement both models using native journald features.

Push model:

(log source) systemd-journal-upload -> systemd-journal-remote (log collector)

Pull model:

(log source) systemd-journal-gatewayd &lt;- systemd-journal-remote (log collector)

The arrow shows who initiates the connection. HTTPS is used as a transport so it's secure.

The more information can be obtained from:

and so on.
