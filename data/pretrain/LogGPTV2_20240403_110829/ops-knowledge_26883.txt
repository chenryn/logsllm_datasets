Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and clear version of your text:

I am running a Python job from Jenkins, and I have the following question:

I am setting the number of users as an external parameter. For example, I pass the command:
```bash
python /home/py_version/single_run.py $number_of_users
```

I would like to be able to specify which user IDs to use, either through Jenkins or within the script itself.

Do you know if Jenkins provides the specific user IDs, or does it only provide the number of users? If Jenkins does not provide the user IDs, I will need to determine them on my own. Unfortunately, I do not have administrative access to a Jenkins installation to check this myself.

Thank you!
