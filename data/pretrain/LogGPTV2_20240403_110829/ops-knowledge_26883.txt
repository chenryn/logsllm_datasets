User: I am running Python job from Jenkins... now my question is as follow:
I am setting number of users as an external parameter, for example I am passing this command: 
python /home/py_version/single_run.py $number_of_users
i want to be able to set a way to choose what are the users (in this case users ids) from the jenkins or the script itself... 
thanks!
Assistant: Does jenkins also provide the information 'which users' too or just the 'number of users', so you would have to get the 'which users' by your own? I don't have a jenkins installation with administrativ access, so I cannot check this myself.
