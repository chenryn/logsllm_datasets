Abstract—We propose a new approach for securely verifying
sequences of location claims from mobile nodes. The key idea
is to exploit the inherent mobility of the nodes in order to
constrain the degree of freedom of an attacker when spooﬁng
consecutive location updates along a claimed track. We show
that in the absence of noise, our approach is able to securely
verify any 2-D track with a minimum of three veriﬁers or any
3-D track with four veriﬁers. Our approach is lightweight in
the sense that it considerably relaxes the system requirements
compared to previous secure location veriﬁcation schemes which
are all agnostic to mobility. As opposed to previous schemes, our
track veriﬁcation solution is at the same time (i) passive, (ii)
does not require any time synchronization among the veriﬁers,
(iii) does not need to keep the location of the veriﬁers secret,
(iv) nor does it require specialized hardware. This makes our
solution particularly suitable for large-scale deployments. We
have evaluated our solution in a realistic air trafﬁc monitoring
scenario using real-world data. Our results show that 25 position
claims on a track are sufﬁcient to detect spooﬁng attacks with
a false positive rate of 1.4% and a false negative rate of 1.2%.
For tracks with more than 40 claims, the false positive and false
negative rates drop to zero.
I. INTRODUCTION
The ability to track the motion of vehicles in airborne,
ground, or maritime trafﬁc control systems is a key feature to
enable safe navigation and collision avoidance. For example
in commercial air trafﬁc control systems, the tracks of all
aircraft are continuously monitored to inform pilots and safety
personnel on the ground about potential aircraft collisions.
Similarly, collision avoidance systems in future autonomous
car navigation systems will require car tracking to prevent
collisions at intersections [1].
A common paradigm for tracking the mobility of vehicles
is to let nodes determine their own positions and broadcast
them to nearby nodes. For example, in the next-generation air
transportation system, aircraft determine their own positions
with the aid of global navigation satellite systems such as
GPS. This information is then periodically broadcast over
the Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B)
system to surrounding aircraft and sensors on the ground [2].
While this autonomous paradigm has many advantages such
as relatively low costs, it makes the system vulnerable to
location spooﬁng attacks [3], [4]. As an example related to
ADS-B, Figure 1 shows the situation in which an attacker
injects false position messages in order to emulate the track
of a ghost aircraft into the air trafﬁc surveillance and collision
avoidance systems. This attack is performed by sending fake

can have severe or even life-threatening consequences.
position reports of airplanes which do not exist. In that way,
an adversary could mislead collision avoidance systems and
unmanned air vehicles or confuse air trafﬁc controllers. It
has been shown that these attacks are easy to launch on real
systems [4] and the ability to verify the track claims in such
systems is therefore of high importance [5].
Many schemes have been proposed in the literature to
securely verify the location claims in wireless broadcast
networks [6]–[11]. However, most of these systems are ac-
tive and require specialized hardware or directional antennas.
A real implementation of these protocols remains therefore
often a challenge as they require expensive deployments or
upgrades of existing infrastructure. Passive schemes such as
multilateration [5], [12] or veriﬁcation with hidden and mobile
base stations [13] have also been proposed. However, passive
multilateration requires a very tight time synchronization on
the order of a few nanoseconds between the veriﬁers. Further-
more, proposals such as [13] require the verifying nodes to be
at locations that are kept secret from the attacker.
In this paper, we propose a secure track veriﬁcation tech-
nique which is completely passive, does not require a tight
time synchronization between the veriﬁers, and works even if
the attacker knows the positions of the veriﬁers. In addition, it
does neither require any specialized hardware nor directional
antennas. This makes the approach particularly suitable for
low-cost and large-scale deployments. The core idea of our
approach is to exploit the mobility of the prover to verify its
position securely as it moves along a track. As we show in this
work, the mobility of the prover is a useful dimension that can

be exploited to signiﬁcantly relax costly system requirements
of existing location veriﬁcation schemes which are agnostic to
the mobility of the prover.
Our novel scheme is based on the mobility-differentiated
time of arrival (ToA). In constrast
to existing point-wise
location veriﬁcation or multilateration schemes, our approach
veriﬁes a sequence of location claims of a prover. We show that
with this technique, it is possible to verify the track of mobile
nodes locally at each receiver and, hence, avoid the need for
tight synchronization among the veriﬁers. The veriﬁcation is
based on physical signal propagation constraints and local time
differences at the veriﬁer between messages that are sent by
the mobile node at different positions and times.
This technique is able to correctly verify tracks from honest
nodes. However, it is not secure against attacks on single
veriﬁers. An attacker could easily adjust the transmission times
of its messages to spoof any desired track for a given receiver.
We thus derive the requirements for using our technique for
secure veriﬁcation of track claims. We show that the resulting
track veriﬁcation scheme is secure against attacks from a
stationary adversary. The two-dimensional track of a mobile
node can be constrained to a unique solution when at least
three messages are received by at least three geographically
distributed veriﬁers. With four or more distributed veriﬁers,
any three-dimensional track can be securely veriﬁed as well.
In order to understand the performance of track veriﬁcation
under real-world conditions, we have further performed simu-
lations with different levels of noise and losses at the veriﬁers.
Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to securely verify
ﬂights as obtained from OpenSky [14], a large-scale ADS-
B sensor network deployed in Central Europe. Our results
suggest that our solution is able to effectively detect track
spooﬁng attacks under realistic noise and air trafﬁc conditions.
A. Contributions
The contributions of this work are as follows:
• We present a passive and lightweight solution to the
secure track veriﬁcation problem which exploits the mo-
bility of the provers in order to relax the costly system
requirements of existing solutions.
• We provide a formal analysis, proving the security of our
scheme for two-dimensional and three-dimensional track
veriﬁcation.
• We analyze the performance of our method by conducting
simulations with a realistic noise model.

trafﬁc monitoring scenario by using real tracks from the
OpenSky sensor network.
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Similar to secure location veriﬁcation as deﬁned by Sastry
et al. [6], we deﬁne the problem of secure track veriﬁcation
as follows: A set of veriﬁers V wish to check whether a
prover moves on a claimed track T . A track claim consists
of a sequence of location claims, that is T = {C1, . . . , Cn}.
Each location claim Ci is a tuple (ti, (cid:2)pi), where ti denotes

a prover-local timestamp with its corresponding location (cid:2)pi.
Locations are assumed to be two- or three-dimensional Eu-
clidean coordinates. The location claim Ci is sent at time ti
and from location (cid:2)pi. In other words, by transmitting Ci, the
prover claims to be at position (cid:2)pi at the transmission time of
Ci and its local, unsynchronized clock shows the value ti.
Our goal is to verify tracks of moving nodes. Accordingly,
we further assume that |T| > 1 and pi (cid:2)= pj for at least one
pair of location claims Ci, Cj ∈ T . This assumption clearly
draws a distinction between our problem and that of location
or in-region veriﬁcation as deﬁned in [6].
A. Time Notation
We assume that both, prover and veriﬁers are equipped
with clocks which do not have to be synchronized – a major
advantage of our scheme. Timestamps represent the local time
of a node at a certain event. To distinguish between global time
and local timestamps, we denote global time with t and the
node-local time that corresponds to t (i.e., the timestamp at
time t) with t. For the theoretical analysis, we assume that
all clocks run at the same speed and positions as well as
timestamps are perfect, i.e., can be measured without error.
The effects of clock drift and measurement error are studied
in detail in Section IV.
The following temporal relationships and notations are sum-
marized in Figure 2. The timespan between the transmissions
of two location claims Ci and Cj is denoted by Δi,j = tj −ti.
The arrival time of a location claim Ci at veriﬁer Vx ∈ V
is denoted by tx
the timespan between the
arrivals of two location claims Ci and Cj at Vx is denoted
j − tx
by Δx
i . The propagation delay of Ci’s signal on
its way to a veriﬁer Vx is denoted by Δx
i . Analogously,
i − ti.
i,j = tx
i = tx
Values derived by local timestamps are overlined. For the
following analysis, it is worth noting that for two honest
location claims Ci and Cj, it holds that Δi,j = tj − ti = Δi,j.
B. System Model
The system model is motivated by air trafﬁc monitoring
(ATM) systems. In the upcoming next generation air trans-
portation system, aircraft determine their own position using

satellite navigation and broadcast it periodically to surrounding
ground stations. These position reports can be considered as
location claims of the aircraft’s track. The receiving ground
stations are connected via ground networks. In aviation, fa-
cilities are usually well protected and therefore, the ground
stations and the network can be assumed to be secure.
In our model, a moving prover accordingly broadcasts a
sequence of location claims Ci (i = 1, 2, . . . ) to a set of sta-
tionary veriﬁers {Vx, Vy, . . .} using a wireless communication
channel. We assume that there is no compromised veriﬁer and
all veriﬁers are able to communicate securely with each other.
Each veriﬁer Vx knows its position (cid:2)px.
Besides ATM, other systems are also well conceivable areas
of application for our scheme. The key characteristic of our
system model is the mobility of the prover. Therefore, any
location-aware application with mobile stations (e.g., vehicular
ad hoc networks or cellular networks) might be a potential
target system for our scheme.
C. Adversarial Model
In order to analyze the security of our track veriﬁcation
scheme, we use the following threat model. We consider a
single adversary A located at position (cid:2)pA. We assume for our
theoretical analysis that it uses an omni-directional antenna to
broadcast the location claims. This strong assumption ensures
that all veriﬁers in the reception area of A receive the exact
same location claims during the veriﬁcation process. In section
V, we propose an extension to our scheme that allows to also
defend against attackers that are able to control exactly who
is receiving which location claim.
The adversary has full control of the location claim’s
content. In particular, (cid:2)pi and ti are chosen by the attacker and
the transmission time ti of Ci does not necessarily correlate
with the timestamp ti. In addition to these assumptions, the
adversary also knows the exact position of all veriﬁers. Further
adversarial models such as mobile attackers or attackers with
limited knowledge are discussed in section VIII.
With respect to the ATM scenario, a realization of our
threat model could be an adversary positioned close to an
airport that injects fake position reports to cause confusion
or prevent departures. As mentioned above, the feasibility of
such attacks has been successfully demonstrated, even with
low-cost hardware [3], [4].
III. BASIC VERIFICATION SCHEME
Using the above notations, we can conclude that for valid
location claims, the inter-arrival times of the location claims
Ci and Cj at veriﬁer Vx differ from the inter-transmission
times by the difference in propagation delays from (cid:2)pi and (cid:2)pj
to (cid:2)px:
Δx
i,j = Δi,j + (Δx
j − Δx
i )
(1)
Provers and veriﬁers do not have a common time base
since they are not assumed to be synchronized. Yet, based
on the reported and measured local timestamps, the veriﬁer
can calculate Δi,j and Δx
i,j. The propagation delays can be
201201
i/j = (cid:4)(cid:2)pi/j − (cid:2)px(cid:4)/c, where c denotes the
estimated using Δx
signal propagation speed and (cid:4) · (cid:4) the Euclidean distance.
At the core of our track veriﬁcation scheme, each veriﬁer
checks for all pairs Ci, Cj ∈ T whether the following property
holds:
Δx
i,j
?= Δi,j + (Δx
j − Δx
i )
(2)
It is easy to see that Equation (2) is the same as Equation
(1) if the prover reported its position and timestamps correctly.
Thus, Equation (2) holds if the prover claimed its track
honestly. Using the terminology of location veriﬁcation, our
scheme therefore satisﬁes the property of completeness [6].
Concerning the security property of our veriﬁcation scheme,
we claim that given a certain number of veriﬁers, a dishonest
prover cannot send false location claims without violating
Equation (2) for at least one veriﬁer. To prove this hypothesis,
we conduct a theoretical security analysis next.
A. Security Analysis
For our analysis, we assume that the adversary’s goal is to
claim a track with two location claims C1 = (t1, (cid:2)p1) and
C2 = (t2, (cid:2)p2) with (cid:2)p1 (cid:2)= (cid:2)p2. We can do so without loss
of generality, since Equation (2) constitutes a pairwise check
for all claims in T without particular order. Hence, if our
scheme is secure for arbitrary C1 and C2, it is also secure
for track T . To provide a better understanding how security is
established in our veriﬁcation scheme, we analyze it step by
step by increasing the number of veriﬁers |V | which receive
C1 and C2.
Case |V | = 1: With respect to the calculation done by the
veriﬁers, we can rewrite Equation (2) as
?= (t2 − t1) + (Δx

The adversary’s goal is to ﬁnd a transmission time t2 for C2
relative to t1, such that the inter-arrival time at Vx (left-hand
side of the equation) corresponds to the location claims C1 and
