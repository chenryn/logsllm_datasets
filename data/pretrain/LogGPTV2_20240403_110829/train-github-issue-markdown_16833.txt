**Steps**
  * Set "SELENIUM_REMOTE_CAPABILITIES" as documented here
  * Selenium Grid connection is starting up
  * Selenium Grid reports request to use custom capabilities
  * Capabilities passed in are not what the Selenium connection reports to be using
**Expected**
Expected the Documentation on this to be much more detailed
  * The /wd/hub should be removed or at least mentioned that this URL will ONLY be used when the docker image is passed this URL (/wd/hub could be omitted)
  * What is "MyGrid:options"
  * What are the Capabilities to be used (WebDriver or selenium names, is it "browser_version" or "browserVersion")
Can you please in the very near future update the documentation on this, I
need to pass in some capabilities and am trying to figure out how to pass in
for e.g. browswerVersion
**Actual**
Trial and error on how to pass capabilities through playwright to selenium
grid and in what sepcific format they need to be in without prevail.
