Electronic Roadside Construction Signs 
(ERCS)
ERCS
• Started showing up in mid- to late-2008
• One manufacturer in particular is used by DoT
• Started with “zombies ahead” and 
deteriorated from there
• Post from i-hacked has step-by-step 
instructions on how to do it
– Posted in January of 2009, but is still accurate
– Has pictures!
ERCS: Vulnerabilities
• Easy to find
• Unlocked or “secured” by a small master lock
• Control pad is in the access panel
• Usually no password
– If there is a password, it’s usually a default 
password
• If not default, can easily be changed
ERCS: Don’t be a dumbass
• Usually on a busy road (or right before one)
• If it warns of impending construction, don’t do 
it right before or during construction hours
• Some areas may have cameras
• Use common sense
– Gloves
– Be a hoodie ninja
– Walk, don’t drive directly up to it

ODBN: Update and Notes
• Uses digital signage software that is ran

machines (unless there’s a XP virtual running)

signage software.
