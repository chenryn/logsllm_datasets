User: I installed Python 3.1 yesterday on my Windows Vista PC, and was surprised to find that the version of IDLE is 2.6.4, for "Python 2.6.4 (r264:75708, Oct 26 2009, 08:23:19) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32"
I was hoping to use IDLE to investigate some of the new features of Python 3...
I guess I'm stuck with the command line...
Anyone know what's up with Python 3's IDLE?
Thanks
Assistant: Type 'idle3' in the terminal window. That should launch your copy of idle 3.1
