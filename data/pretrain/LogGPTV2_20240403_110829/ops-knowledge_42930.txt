**Subject: Issue with IDLE Version After Installing Python 3.1 on Windows Vista**

Yesterday, I installed Python 3.1 on my Windows Vista PC. To my surprise, when I launched IDLE, it appeared to be version 2.6.4, as indicated by the following startup message:

```
Python 2.6.4 (r264:75708, Oct 26 2009, 08:23:19) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
```

I was looking forward to using IDLE to explore some of the new features in Python 3.1, but it seems that I am limited to the command line for now.

Does anyone have any insights into why Python 3.1â€™s IDLE is not launching, or how I can resolve this issue?

Thank you.

**Response:**

To launch the correct version of IDLE for Python 3.1, try entering `idle3` in your terminal window. This should open the IDLE environment associated with Python 3.1.
