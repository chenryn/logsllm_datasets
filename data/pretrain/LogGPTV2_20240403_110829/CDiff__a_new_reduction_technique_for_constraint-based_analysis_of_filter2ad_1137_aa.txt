## Abstract

**Keywords:**
- Melanocortin-5 receptor
- Poultry
- Livestock
- cAMP
- pERK1/2

The melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5R) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily that plays a critical role in lipid production, skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation, and adipocyte lipolysis. While the multiple functions and importance of MC5R in humans have been well-documented, the molecular cloning, pharmacological characteristics, and key amino acids in poultry and pigs remain less understood. In this study, we successfully cloned MC5R genes from chicken (Gallus gallus, cMC5R), duck (Anas platyrhynchos, dMC5R), goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus, gMC5R), and pig (Sus scrofa domestica, pMC5R). We compared their genetic and protein differences with human MC5R (hMC5R) through phylogenetic analysis and homology modeling. Additionally, we constructed three alanine-substitution mutants for each MC5R, including c/d/gMC5R-D119A/F254A/H257A and pMC5R-D204A/F339A/H342A. We then characterized the pharmacological properties of these wild-type and mutant receptors in HEK293T cells, focusing on intracellular cAMP generation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels. The results showed that the mutants exhibited decreased cAMP levels under ligand stimulation, despite enhanced basal activity for c/d/gF254A and pH342A, indicating their importance in receptor location and activation. Notably, the MC5Rs and their mutants displayed species-specific phenotypes in the activation of pERK1/2, which were not entirely consistent with hMC5R. These findings highlight interspecies differences in MC5Rs, particularly in the pERK1/2 pathway. Our study expands the current knowledge of the molecular and pharmacological characterization of c/d/g/pMC5Rs, providing preliminary data for MC5R-targeted drug screening or genetic breeding of economic animals.

## 1. Introduction

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane proteins, mediating physiological responses to hormones, neurotransmitters, and environmental stimuli, making them valuable therapeutic targets for various diseases (Rosenbaum et al., 2009; Venkatakrishnan et al., 2013). Among GPCRs, melanocortin receptors (MCRs) belong to the rhodopsin-like GPCRs with seven transmembrane domains (TMD) and include five subtypes (MC1R to MC5R) (Mountjoy et al., 1992). MCRs play crucial roles in pigmentation, lipolysis, stress, immunity, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular function (Getting, 2006). Specifically, MC1R is associated with epidermal melanin production (Herraiz et al., 2017); MC2R regulates adrenal function, and its dysfunction can lead to familial glucocorticoid deficiency (Chhajlani et al., 1996). MC3R, expressed in the central nervous system and some peripheral tissues, regulates body fat and diet-induced obesity (Gantz et al., 1993; Chen et al., 2000). MC4R, mainly expressed in the hypothalamus, regulates food intake and body weight (Krashes et al., 2016). Mutations in MC4R are a common cause of obesity (Vaisse et al., 2000).

In contrast, MC5R, consisting of 343 amino acids, is widely distributed in skeletal muscle and exocrine tissues and is involved in lipid production, skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation, and adipocyte lipolysis (Konda, 1994). Defects in MC5R can cause metabolic and exocrine gland dysfunctions (Li et al., 2011). MC5R-deficient mice exhibit accelerated lipolysis and reduced oil secretion (Chen et al., 1997). In humans, MC5R increases carnitine transferase and fatty acid oxidation in a dose-dependent manner when activated by α-MSH (Yang et al., 2013a). Missense polymorphisms in hMC5R, especially in conserved TMD amino acids, can affect ligand binding and downstream functions (Yang et al., 2011). Upon ligand stimulation, MC5R couples to Gs and activates adenylyl cyclase, enhancing intracellular cAMP accumulation (Kobayashi et al., 2016). Despite the well-documented functions of MC5R in humans, the molecular and pharmacological characteristics of MC5Rs in poultry and pigs are not fully understood. Given the economic importance of poultry and pigs, a better understanding of MC5R's molecular and pharmacological properties could provide valuable data for drug screening and genetic breeding.

### 2.1. Materials and Reagents

- Fast mutagenesis system kit: Transgen Biotech (Beijing, China)
- ClonExpress®II one step cloning kit and ExFect 2000 transfection reagent: Vazyme Biotech (Nanjing, China)
- DMEM/F-12 1:1 medium: Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA)

- Reporter gene plasmids pGL4.29-[luc2P/CRE/Hygro] and pGMLR-TK: Promega (Madison, USA)

### 2.2. Molecular Cloning of c/d/g/pMC5R

Total DNA from chicken, duck, and goose blood was isolated using the TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (TianGen Biotech, Beijing, China). Total RNA from pig liver was isolated using the RNAsimple Total RNA Kit (TianGen Biotech). The coding sequences (CDS) of c/d/g/pMC5R were amplified by PCR or RT-PCR using specific primers (Table S1) designed based on GeneBank sequences. The PCR products were digested with Hind III and Xho I restriction enzymes and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector using the ClonExpress®II one step cloning kit. The recombinant plasmids were sequenced to ensure no PCR-induced errors.

### 2.3. Phylogenetic Analysis and Homology Models

The cloned c/d/g/pMC5Rs and related genes from the NCBI database (human, monkey, sheep, chimpanzee, cattle, Norway rat, and mouse) were aligned using ClustalX 2.1. A maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 6.0, and the reliability was evaluated by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications. The tree was visualized using iTOL. Homology models of MC5Rs were predicted using SWISS-MODEL, and the structural figures were refined using PyMOL.

### 2.4. Site-Directed Mutagenesis

Three mutations were introduced into each of the four MC5Rs (12 mutant plasmids in total) using the Fast Mutagenesis System Kit (Transgen Biotech). The mutated MC5Rs were sequenced to confirm the absence of errors. Pure plasmid DNA was isolated using the EndoFree Maxi Plasmid Kit V2 (TianGen Biotech) and used for subsequent transfection experiments.

### 2.5. Cell Culture and Transfection

HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were harvested at 60–80% confluence. For transient expression, MC5Rs alone or with reporter gene plasmids (total 12 μg/plate, MC5R: pGL4.29: pGMLR-TK = 1:10:2) were transfected into HEK293T cells using ExFect®2000 transfection reagent (Vazyme Biotech). After 24 hours, the transfection mixtures were replaced with serum-free culture medium.

### 2.6. cAMP Generation by Dual-Reported Genes Method

The transiently transfected cells expressing MC5Rs or mutants were analyzed for intracellular cAMP generation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels. The results indicated that the mutants showed decreased cAMP levels under ligand stimulation, despite enhanced basal activity for c/d/gF254A and pH342A, highlighting their importance in receptor location and activation. Species-specific differences in the activation of pERK1/2 were also observed, suggesting interspecies variations in MC5R function.
