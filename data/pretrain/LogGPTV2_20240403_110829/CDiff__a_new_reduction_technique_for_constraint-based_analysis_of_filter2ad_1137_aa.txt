The melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5R) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily that plays a
critical role in lipid production, skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation, and adipocyte lipolysis. Although multiple
functions and important value of MC5R in human beings have been fully demonstrated, however, the potential
molecular cloning, pharmacological characteristics and key amino acids in poultry and pig were still not fully
understood. Herein, we successfully cloned MC5R genes from chicken (Gallus gallus, cMC5R), duck (Anas pla-
tyrhynchos, dMC5R), goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus, gMC5R) and pig (Sus scrofa domestica, pMC5R), and
compared their genetic and protein diﬀerence with hMC5R through phylogenetic analysis and homology models.
Besides, we constructed three alanine-substitution mutants for each of MC5Rs through homologous re-
organization, including c/d/gMC5R-D119A/F254A/H257A and pMC5R-D204A/F339A/H342A. Subsequently,
we focused our investigation on the pharmacological characterization of four wide-type MC5Rs and their mu-
tants in HEK293T cells, including the intracellular cAMP generation and phosphorylation level of ERK1/2. The
results showed that these mutants had decreased cAMP levels under the stimulation of ligands, in spite of
enhanced basal activity for c/d/gF254A and pH342A, indicating their important roles in the location and ac-
tivation of receptors. Notably, these MC5Rs and mutants displayed signiﬁcant species-speciﬁc phenotypes in the
activation of pERK1/2 with ligands, which was not completely consistent with hMC5R. These ﬁndings de-
monstrated that presence of interspecies diﬀerences for MC5Rs, particularly for the pERK1/2 pathway. Taken
together, our study expands current knowledge about the molecular and pharmacological characterization of c/
d/g/pMC5Rs, providing preliminary data for MC5R-targeted drug screening or genetic breeding of economic
animals in the future.
1. Introduction
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of
membrane proteins and mediate most of our physiological responses to
hormones, neurotransmitters and environmental
stimulants, and
thereby have great potential as therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum
of diseases (Rosenbaum et al., 2009; Venkatakrishnan et al., 2013).
Among the subgroups of GPCRs, melanocortin receptors (MCRs) belong
to rhodopsin-like GPCRs with seven transmembrane domains (TMD)
and thus far possess ﬁve sub-types (MC1R to MC5R) (Mountjoy et al.,
1992). Previous evidence has proved that MCRs play an important role
in pigmentation, lipolysis, stress, immunity, energy metabolism and
cardiovascular
function (Getting, 2006). Speciﬁcally, MC1R is
associated with the production of epidermal melanin pigments (Herraiz
et al., 2017); MC2R anticipates the regulation of adrenal function, and
its dysfunction would lead to a potentially fatal disease-familial glu-
cocorticoid deﬁciency (FGD) (Chhajlani et al., 1996). MC3R is pro-
duced in the central nervous system and some peripheral tissues (Gantz
et al., 1993), which plays an important role in regulating body fat and
accelerating diet-induced obesity (Chen et al., 2000). MC4R is mainly
expressed in the hypothalamus and involved in regulating food intake
and body weight (Krashes et al., 2016). MC4R stimulates hormones (α-
MSH) by activating α-melanocytes. Mutations in MC4R are found in
obese patients, representing the most common cause of unilateral
obesity (Vaisse et al., 2000). In addition to hMC4R, studies on role of
MC4R in regulation of food intake have been extended to other species,

such as chicken (Wang et al., 2016a) and giant panda (Wang et al.,
2016b).
Diﬀerent from other four types of MCRs, MC5R is a protein that
consists of 343 amino acids and expressed in a variety of forms and
widely distributed in skeletal muscle and exocrine tissues (Konda,
1994). MC5R is involved in lipid production, skeletal muscle fatty acid
oxidation, and adipocyte lipolysis. Previous studies showed that defects
in MC5R could cause skeletal muscle fatty acid and fat cell metabolism,
and exocrine gland dysfunction (Li et al., 2011). Mice with MC5R de-
ﬁciency had accelerated lipolysis and reduced oil secretion (Chen et al.,
1997). In humans, MC5R can increase the oxidation of carnitine
transferase and fatty acids in a dose-dependent manner under the ac-
tivation of the endogenous agonist α-MSH (Yang et al., 2013a). It has
also been proved that some missense polymorphisms in hMC5R would
aﬀect its binding activity with ligands and downstream functions,
particularly for conserved amino acids in transmembrane domains
(TMD). For example, the mutations of E92 (TMD 2), D115/119 (TMD
3), W251, F254 and H257 (TMD 6) would result in decreased NDP-α-
MSH binding aﬃnity and potency with hMC5R (Yang et al., 2011).
Upon stimulation by active ligands, MC5R couples to the stimulatory
heterotrimeric G protein (Gs) and activates adenylyl cyclase to enhance
the intracellular accumulation of cAMP (Kobayashi et al., 2016). Thus,
the generation of cAMP is recognized as the important indicator to
evaluate the receptors’ response to stimulators. Although multiple
functions and important value of MC5R in human beings have been
fully demonstrated, however, the potential molecular cloning, phar-
macological characteristics and key amino acids of MC5Rs in poultry
and pig were still not fully understood. Accordingly, poultry and pig are
critical economic animals worldwide, which provides cost-eﬀective
proteins and energy for human daily life. Most notably, MC5R mediated
synthesis of fatty acid is critical for improving the production and
beneﬁt of economic animals. Therefore, a better understanding of
molecular, pharmacological characteristics and related signal pathways
during the interaction between receptors and ligands would provide
preliminary data for MC5R-targeted drug screening or genetic breeding
of poultry and pig in the future.
c/d/gMC5R-D119A/F254A/H257A and
In this study, we ﬁrst cloned MC5R genes from chicken (cMC5R),
duck (dMC5R), goose (gMC5R) and pig (pMC5R), and constructed eu-
karyotic expression vectors. Besides, three mutants in each of four
species were constructed by single point mutation technology, in-
cluding
pMC5R-D204A/
F339A/H342A. Then, we determined the intracellular cAMP levels of
wide type and mutants in human embryonic kidney T cells (HEK293T)
by dual-luciferase reporter genes assay, and the phosphorylation level
of extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) induced by li-
gands through western blot analysis. Consequently, we found that the
all alanine-substitution mutants showed decreased cAMP generation
under the stimulation of ligands in spite of enhanced basal activity for
c/d/gF254A and pH342A, indicating the important roles of these po-
sitions in location and activation of cAMP signaling. Meanwhile, under
the activation of agonist NDP-α-MSH or antagonist AgRP, only partial
receptors and mutants showed similar pERK1/2 expression compared
with hMC5R. These results demonstrated MC5Rs from diﬀerent species
and their mutants displayed various actions under the interaction with
ligands, suggesting the presence of interspecies diﬀerences for MC5Rs.

plasmids pGL4.29-[luc2P/CRE/Hygro] and pGMLR-TK were purchased
from Promega (Madison, USA).
2.2. Molecular cloning of c/d/g/pMC5R
Total DNAs from chicken, duck and goose blood were isolated using
the TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (TianGen Biotech, Beijing, China) fol-
lowing the manufacturer instructions. Total RNA from pig liver was
isolated using the RNAsimple Total RNA Kit (TianGen Biotech). The
coding sequence (CDS) of c/d/g/pMC5R were ampliﬁed by PCR or re-
verse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using the speciﬁc primers (Table S1)
that designed in accordance with the predicted sequence in GeneBank.
The PCR ampliﬁcation products of MC5Rs were digested with Hind III
and Xho I restriction enzymes, then were cloned in the pcDNA3.1(+)
vector through using the ClonExpress®II one step cloning kit (Vazyme
Biotech). The pcDNA3.1(+)-c/d/g/pMC5R recombinant plasmids were
subsequently sequenced to ensure that no errors were induced by PCR
reactions.
2.3. Phylogenetic analysis and homology models
The cloned c/d/g/pMC5Rs as described above and other related
genes from NCBI database, including from human (accession number:
NM_005913), monkey (NM_001193897),
sheep (NM_001078656),
chimpanzee (NM_001009119), cattle (NM_001015542), norway rat
(NM_013182) and mouse (L27081). Multiple alignment of selected se-
quences was conducted by ClustalX 2.1. Then, a maximum likelihood
tree was produced by MEGA 6.0. The reliability of the resulting tress
was evaluated by bootstrap method with 1000 replications. Lastly,
phylogenetic tress was visualized by iTOL. For homology models of
MC5Rs, SWISS-MODEL was used to perform protein 3D structure pre-
diction. The structural ﬁgures were polished and generated by PyMOL.
2.4. Site-directed mutagenesis
Each three mutations of four MC5Rs (12 mutant plasmids in total)
were introduced into the MC5R with the Fast Mutagenesis System Kit
(Transgen Biotech). Subsequently, the nucleotide sequences of the
mutated MC5Rs were sequenced to ensure no errors during ampliﬁca-
tion. The isolation of pure plasmids was performed using the EndoFree
Maxi Plasmid Kit V2 (TianGen Biotech) and these DNAs were used on
next transfection experiments.
2.5. Cell culture and transfection
HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented
with 10% newborn calf serum in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells
were harvested until 60–80% conﬂuency reached. For transient ex-
pression of receptors, MC5Rs alone or with reporter gene plasmids,
about 12 μg/plate in total (MC5R: pGL4.29: pGMLR-TK = 1: 10: 2),
were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells with by using
ExFect®2000 transfection reagent (Vazyme Biotech) as recommended
