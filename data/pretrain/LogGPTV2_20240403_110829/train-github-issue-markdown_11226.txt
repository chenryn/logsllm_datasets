# Description of the new feature/enhancement
Ability to specify a list of command(s) to be ran upon opening a new terminal.
This would be extremely useful if users wanted to configure their terminal
upon opening a new tab, for example, I would like that once I open a new CMD
instance it would go to a specific directory (cd ...).
It's obvious there may need to be different lists for different terminals.
