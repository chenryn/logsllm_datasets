REPOST of #14403 because closed prematurily and not sure the other question I
just posted could be reopened (newbie here) but I certainly could not and I
think this is an important thing that needs to be sorted out, but if rules
entails to continue the conversation on the other post, please delete this one
and we will do so.
**_OLD** _  
I just discovered a bug that has been giving me a headache.
Basically I was using a jqvmap and when clicking on a country I would create a
popup with some info.  
So I initialize the popup as follows:
    $('.jvectormap-region').popover({
                placement: 'left',
                container: '#vmap',
                html: 'true',
                title: ' ',
            });
and onClick I would do this:
    $('#vmap').bind('regionClick.jqvmap',
                function(event, code, region) {
                    var baseRegionId = "#jqvmap1_";
                    baseRegionId = baseRegionId + code;
                    if ($('#vmap [id^="popover"]').length > 1) {
                        $('#vmap [id^="popover"]').first().remove();
                    }
                    var snapshot_url = "http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/" + region + "/snapshot.aspx";
                    $(".popover-title").html(region);
                    $(".popover-content").html('Snapshotpage 2page 3page 4');
                }
            );
So basically if there was already a popup on screen I would delete it so that
the newly created popup will be alone in the page. Problem is that exactly the
6th time I was clicking on a country a popup would not be created!
I ran this multiple times and ALWAYS happened.
I solved it by triggering it manually and the issue is then resolved, but this
is something that needs to be fixed..
