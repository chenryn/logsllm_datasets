I am using Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 and Typescript for VS2015 1.8.4.  
I have a project that contains TypeScript files.  
Here's my `tsconfig.json`
    {
      "compileOnSave": true,
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "module": "system",
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "sourceMap": true,
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "removeComments": false,
        "noImplicitAny": false,
        "noEmitOnError": true
      },
      "exclude": [
        "node_modules",
        "typings"
      ]
    }
When I write incorrect TypeScript, let's say i have `file1.ts` and write `foo`
, I obtain the error message  
`Cannot find name 'foo'`
If I try to build the project, it will result in a build failure. When the
`file1.ts` file is correct, it generates the `file.js` file next to it and I
can build successfully. So far so good.
Now, if I change once again `file1.ts` , it will show `Cannot find name 'foo'`
in the error list but building the project succeeds.
What I expect is for the project build to fail.
The project build will fail again when I remove the generated `file1.js` file.
Shouldn't the TypeScript compiler try to recompile all the *.ts files that are
newer than their output when I perform a build, or have the `compileOnSave`
option to remove the output?
