User: Please describe the process of DNS resolution, as well as the common problems and solutions encountered when using DNS.
Assistant: The process of DNS resolution is as follows: 1. The user enters the URL in the browser, such as www.google.com. 2. The local DNS server looks up the required IP address according to the cache, and if there is no cache, it requests the root DNS server. 3. The root DNS server returns the IP address of the top-level domain name server. 4. The local DNS server sends a request to the top-level domain name server. 5. The top-level domain name server returns the IP address of the authoritative DNS server. 6. The local DNS server sends a request to the authoritative DNS server. 7. The authoritative DNS server returns the IP address of the desired URL. 8. The local DNS server saves the IP address in the cache. 9. The browser uses the IP address to access the website. When using DNS, common problems include: 1. DNS server failure: the browser cannot locate the IP address corresponding to the website. Solution: Change the DNS server IP address or wait for the DNS server to return to normal. 2. DNS hijacking: Malware tampers with the IP address of a specific website on the DNS server, causing users to visit fake websites. Workaround: Use antivirus software or a VPN to protect against malware or man-in-the-middle attacks. 3. DNS cache problem: The IP address cached in the local DNS server may have expired or been tampered with, resulting in users being unable to access the website normally. Solution: Clear the local DNS cache or wait for the cache to expire automatically. 4. DNS response delay: DNS server response time is too long, website access slows down. Solution: Change to a faster DNS server or use CDN to speed up loading.
