### Bug report
Markers disappear if I use markerfacecolor='None', when saving as eps file. if
I save as png file, they are correctly displayed.  
Note that markeredgewidth is correctly set to a non zero value and
markeredgecolor is correctly set to a color. As I said, the figure is
correctly produced when saved as png, so it should really work similarly for
eps figure, but it doesn't.
**Code for reproduction**
I'm too lazy for a complete reproducible example. But here are the relevant
lines.
    axe.plot(x, y, linestyle = '-', linewidth=0.5, marker = 's', markeredgewidth = 0.5, label='something', c
        lip_on= False, markersize = '3',markerfacecolor='None', markeredgecolor='green', color='green')
    plt.savefig('another_name_come_on_not_this_again.png', format='png', dpi=400)
    plt.savefig('another_name_come_on_not_this_again.eps', format='eps', dpi=400)
Only the line is displayed. No marker.
**Expected outcome**
As said above, the edges of the makers should be displayed, as in the case
when the picture is saved as png. But they aren't.
