It appears that the unit tests in e2e are sometimes failing due to a 60 minute
timeout, but it does not appear to be being correctly applied.
Logs here:  
https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/kubernetes-jenkins/pr-
logs/0586d866de1b0ca888ad3de53ad41cdb2077dd0e/kubernetes-pull-test-unit-
integration/10243/
The weird thing is that the logs show that the unit tests themselves only took
the normal amount of time - ten minutes or so (14:38 - 14:50 in the logs). But
I'm guessing there is an invisible delay before the first timestamp or after
the last timestamp (or the 60 minute limit is not being correctly applied).
The wall clock time in between my request to retest and the failure result
being posted was a little more than an hour (I think), so I think there is a
silent delay somewhere.
