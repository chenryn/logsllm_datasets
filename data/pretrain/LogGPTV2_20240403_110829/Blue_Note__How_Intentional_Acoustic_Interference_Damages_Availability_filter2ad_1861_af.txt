The effectiveness of mitigating acoustic interference by simply
as 103 dB SPL from 1 cm away from the laptop. We have
observed write blocking using signals as low as 95.6 dB SPL.
This demonstrates the possibility of using the laptop’s own
speakers to attack its own hard disk drive.
Beamforming or concealing a speaker can make the speaker
harder to locate and harder to stop. For example, a beamforming
Long Range Acoustic Device could target a device from a
distance greater than 1 mile and may cause malicious effects
before the victim would be able to ﬁnd the emitter.
Acoustic Attacks in Data Centers and Medical Devices.
In a private data center, the environment is controlled by a
single entity and the systems often have no co-located speakers
to mount a self-stimulation attack. Companies or individuals
can rent a rack, cabinet, cage, or room in a co-located data
center. Thus, in a co-located data center, an adversary could pay
to place a speaker next to other targeted machines. However,
the speaker would need to produce inaudible ultrasonic waves
because of constant datacenter monitoring.
Medical devices require high availability. However, in most
hospitals and other medical buildings, there is typically an
abundance of people, making it difﬁcult to attack with audible
frequencies. In the chaos of a hospital or other such building, it
may be possible to conceal a device on one’s person, but it may
also be just as easy to cause denial of service in other ways
without the need of such equipment, such as by unplugging
cables. However, acoustic attacks could cause denial of service
through more sophisticated means that leave little traceability
back to the adversary.
XI. RELATED WORK
Acoustic Interference on Hard Drives.
Sandahl et
al. [2], Siemens [4], and Rawson and Green [3] have in-
vestigated HDD throughput loss due to acoustic interference;
however, they did not consider malicious actors and did not
test ultrasonic signals. An engineer demonstrated how yelling
at HDD arrays can lead to perceptible drops in I/O throughput1.
Ortega [6] demonstrated how hard disk drives can be interfered
with by ﬁnding their resonant frequency. This interference can
lead to the operating system losing its ability to communicate
with the drive. Ortega also suggested that physically damaging
the drives is possible using sound.
Hard Drive Covert and Side Channels.
Previous
research has made use of HDD components’ analog features to
establish covert channels. Guri et al. [33] utilized the HDD’s
built-in thermal sensors to receive data transmitted over the
machine’s heat emissions. Guri et al. [1] used the movements
of a hard drive’s actuator arm to generate audible emissions that
were used to exﬁltrate data from airgapped machines. Since
the head of a hard drive is made up of magnetic materials,
the movement of the head can produce a sufﬁciently strong
magnetic ﬁeld that can be detected by a smartphone’s magnetic
ﬁeld sensors. Matyunin et al. [34] utilized this phenomenon to
build a covert channel by manipulating the movement of the
head.
Much less attention has been devoted to side-channel
information-leakage attacks on HDDs. Biedermann et al. [35]
showed how an attacker could use a smartphone’s magnetic ﬁeld

sensors to deduce information about a machine’s operations.
Previous research has demonstrated how to establish a covert
channel, our work explores the effects induced by injecting
acoustic waves into HDDs.
Acoustic Side Channels.
Recent research has demon-
strated how attackers can utilize acoustic side channels to
interfere with computer systems. Genkin et al. [36] showed
how to extract cryptographic keys by observing the coil whine
of a machine during the decryption process. Son et al. [17]
used sound to crash drones by affecting gyroscopic sensors.
This work was extended by Trippel et al. [8] to spoof the output
of capacitive MEMS accelerometers. We utilized both audible
and ultrasonic acoustic waves to attack HDDs.
Sensors.
Intentionally altering sensor output using physi-
cal signals sources is a topic of recent research. Depending on
the structure of a MEMS gyroscope, performance degradation
can be induced by acoustic resonance [37], [38], [39], [17].
Moreover, researchers have used the data from gyroscopic
sensors as a side channel to extract information [40], [41]. By
utilizing the induction of magnetic sensors, the researchers
were able to apply side-channel attacks for anti-lock braking
systems [42], hard drives [35], and 3D printers [43]. Park et
al. [44] implemented a spooﬁng attack for an IR drop sensor in
medical infusion pumps so that they could control the infusion
rate of the pump. Foo Kune et al. [45] demonstrated how to use
electromagnetic interference to inject signals into analog sensors.
In addition, researchers have demonstrated that spooﬁng attacks
can control optical ﬂow sensors [46] and accelerometers [8].
Our study expands this work by examining the vibration sensor
of the hard drive and exploiting it to DoS HDDs.
XII. CONCLUSION
Adversaries without special purpose equipment can cause
errors in the hard disk drive using either audible or ultrasonic
acoustic waves. Audible waves vibrate the read/write head
and platters; ultrasonic waves alter the output of the HDD’s
shock sensor, intentionally causing the head to park. These
errors can lead to operating system level or application
level consequences including persistent corruption and reboots.
Defenses include mitigating attacks in vulnerable frequency
bands with attenuation controllers, using sensor fusion to detect
attacks, and noise dampening materials to attenuate the signal.

APPENDIX A
FEM MODEL DETAILS
We built a 3D Finite Element Model (FEM) to study the
effect of acoustic interference on hard disks using COMSOL
(Figure 16).
The goal of our simulation is to give evidence that: (i) the
throughput loss is mainly caused by an abnormal displacement
between the head disk assembly and the disk; and (ii) this
displacement is because of the mechanical vibrations induced
by the acoustic interference.
Our analysis explores an example of physical proximity
attack scenario, with the hard drive positioned at 10 cm from
the speaker (Figure 17).
The model estimates, for the head stack assembly top head
suspension, a horizontal/vertical maximum displacement of
roughly 8 nm and 112 nm respectively; and for the top disk a
maximum horizontal/vertical displacement of about 33 nm and
156 nm respectively (Figure 5).
This stationary model highlights how the magnitude of
our attack can induce head stack assembly position errors
considering the track read/write thresholds (15/10 percentage
of the track width respectively) [15] and the distance between
the head and the disk (roughly 6 nm) [16].
Model Mechanics.
The model explores the ﬁne-grained
physics of how sound waves affect
the mechanical parts
composing the hard drive, exposing how: (i) the attack mainly
affects the head stack assembly and the disks; (ii) the magnitude
of the vibration effect depends from the sound pressure
generated by the source, i.e. the more the sound pressure
increases, the greater is the mechanical vibration induced to
the hard drive.

maintaining the same frequency and distance from the hard
drive, the total displacement of the head assembly top head
suspension and disks halved too.
Increasing the sound pressure of the source to 360 Pa, the
total displacement of the head assembly top head suspension
increases to a horizontal/vertical displacement of about 26 nm
and 300 nm, respectively. The top disk, on the other hand,
reaches a horizontal/vertical total displacement of roughly
50 nm and greater than 1 m, respectively.
The latter analysis highlights how the sound pressure
induced by the speaker increases the mechanical displacement
of both disks and head assembly of one order of magnitude.
This phenomenon signiﬁcantly increases the probability of
performance degradation and throughput loss, because of the
possibilities of the read/write head exceeding the read/write
fault thresholds or head crashes.
Model limitations.
There are two main limitations of this
model. (i) The model is stationary, i.e. it does not consider the
spindle system rotation. (ii) The simulation does not consider
all the dynamics of the hard drive components such as ﬂuid or
ball pivot bearing effects.
Despite these assumptions, the simulation is consistent with
previous studies in terms of free vibrations and mode shapes
of both disks and head assembly under acoustic interference
attack [49], [50], [51].
Furthermore, the simulation correctly predicts the through-
put loss investigated in our dynamic study (Section IV).
Fig. 16. The complete geometry of the 3D COMSOL model. The speaker
diaphragm and the dust cap are positioned at the top of the air domain semi-
sphere to replicate an example of physical proximity attack scenario.
Fig. 17. Vertical cross-section plot of the sound pressure level distribution
generated by the speaker at 5 kHz frequency. The model replicates a physical
proximity attack scenario with the hard drive positioned at 10 cm from the
sound source. Note how the sound pressure level decreases with distance
following the Inverse Square Law.
A radius cone, set in an inﬁnite bafﬂe, represents the
diaphragm and the dust cap of a common speaker. A known
sound pressure applied on the dust cap boundary simulates
the generated acoustic interference [47]. We designed the
mechanical structure of the hard disk in SolidWorks-CAD 3.5.
The model includes four read/write heads, an actuator bearing,
a voice coil motor, magnets, a spindle, three disks, and the
HDD chassis. A semi-sphere represents the acoustic radiation
domain of the model, truncated with a Perfectly Matched Layer
(PML) to mimic an inﬁnite open air domain.
A 100 Pa sound wave at 5 kHz generated by the simulated
speaker reaches the hard drive and causes mechanical deforma-
tions. Considering for example 10 cm of distance between the
sound source and the HDD, the sound pressure level measured
on the chassis surface is about 120 dB SPL (Figure 17). This
follows the Inverse Square Law, i.e. the sound pressure level
of a spherical wave decreases with doubling of the distance by
-6 dB [48].
Halving the sound pressure of the source to 50 Pa, while
