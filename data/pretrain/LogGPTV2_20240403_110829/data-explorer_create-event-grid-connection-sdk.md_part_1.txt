# Create an Event Grid data connection for Azure Data Explorer with SDKs
In this article, you learn how to ingest blobs from your storage account into Azure Data Explorer using an Event Grid data connection. You'll create an Event Grid data connection that sets an [Azure Event Grid](/azure/event-grid/overview) subscription. The Event Grid subscription routes events from your storage account to Azure Data Explorer via an Azure Event Hubs.
To learn how to create the connection in the Azure portal or with an ARM template, see [Create an Event Grid data connection](create-event-grid-connection.md).
For general information about ingesting into Azure Data Explorer from Event Grid, see [Connect to Event Grid](ingest-data-event-grid-overview.md).
> [!NOTE]
> To achieve the best performance with the Event Grid connection, set the `rawSizeBytes` ingestion property via the blob metadata. For more information, see [ingestion properties](ingest-data-event-grid-overview.md#ingestion-properties).
> For code samples based on previous SDK versions, see the [archived article](/previous-versions/azure/data-explorer/create-event-grid-connection).
## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. [Create a cluster and database](create-cluster-and-database.md).
* A destination table. [Create a table](kusto/management/create-table-command.md) or use an existing table.
* An [ingestion mapping](kusto/management/mappings.md) for the table.
* A [storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal). An Event Grid notification subscription can be set on Azure Storage accounts for `BlobStorage`, `StorageV2`, or [Data Lake Storage Gen2](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction).
* Have the [Event Grid resource provider registered](/azure/event-grid/blob-event-quickstart-portal#register-the-event-grid-resource-provider).
## Create an Event Grid data connection
In this section, you'll establish a connection between Event Grid and your Azure Data Explorer table.
### [C#](#tab/c-sharp)
1. Install the [Microsoft.Azure.Management.Kusto NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Kusto/).
1. [Create a Microsoft Entra application principal](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to use for authentication. You'll need the directory (tenant) ID, application ID, and client secret.
1. Run the following code.
    ```csharp
    var tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"; //Directory (tenant) ID
    var clientId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx"; //Application ID
    var clientSecret = "PlaceholderClientSecret"; //Client Secret
    var subscriptionId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";
    var credentials = new ClientSecretCredential(tenantId, clientId, clientSecret);
    var resourceManagementClient = new ArmClient(credentials, subscriptionId);
    var resourceGroupName = "testrg";
    //The cluster and database that are created as part of the Prerequisites
    var clusterName = "mykustocluster";
    var databaseName = "mykustodatabase";
    var subscription = await resourceManagementClient.GetDefaultSubscriptionAsync();
    var resourceGroup = (await subscription.GetResourceGroupAsync(resourceGroupName)).Value;
    var cluster = (await resourceGroup.GetKustoClusterAsync(clusterName)).Value;
    var database = (await cluster.GetKustoDatabaseAsync(databaseName)).Value;
    var dataConnections = database.GetKustoDataConnections();
    var eventGridConnectionName = "myeventgridconnect";
    //The event hub and storage account that are created as part of the Prerequisites
    var eventHubResourceId = new ResourceIdentifier("/subscriptions//resourceGroups//providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/");
    var storageAccountResourceId = new ResourceIdentifier("/subscriptions//resourceGroups//providers/Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces//eventhubs/");
    var consumerGroup = "$Default";
    var location = AzureLocation.CentralUS;
    //The table and column mapping are created as part of the Prerequisites
    var tableName = "StormEvents";
    var mappingRuleName = "StormEvents_CSV_Mapping";
    var dataFormat = KustoEventGridDataFormat.Csv;
    var blobStorageEventType = BlobStorageEventType.MicrosoftStorageBlobCreated;
    var databaseRouting = KustoDatabaseRouting.Multi;
    var eventGridConnectionData = new KustoEventGridDataConnection
    {
        StorageAccountResourceId = storageAccountResourceId, EventHubResourceId = eventHubResourceId,
        ConsumerGroup = consumerGroup, TableName = tableName, Location = location, MappingRuleName = mappingRuleName,
        DataFormat = dataFormat, BlobStorageEventType = blobStorageEventType, DatabaseRouting = databaseRouting
    };
    await dataConnections.CreateOrUpdateAsync(WaitUntil.Completed, eventGridConnectionName, eventGridConnectionData);
    ```
    |**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
    |---|---|---|
    | tenantId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | Your tenant ID. Also known as directory ID.|
    | subscriptionId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The subscription ID that you use for resource creation.|
    | clientId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The client ID of the application that can access resources in your tenant.|
    | clientSecret | *PlaceholderClientSecret* | The client secret of the application that can access resources in your tenant. |
    | resourceGroupName | *testrg* | The name of the resource group containing your cluster.|
    | clusterName | *mykustocluster* | The name of your cluster.|
    | databaseName | *mykustodatabase* | The name of the target database in your cluster.|
    | eventGridConnectionName | *myeventgridconnect* | The desired name of your data connection.|
    | tableName | *StormEvents* | The name of the target table in the target database.|
    | mappingRuleName | *StormEvents_CSV_Mapping* | The name of your column mapping related to the target table.|
    | dataFormat | *csv* | The data format of the message.|
    | eventHubResourceId | *Resource ID* | The resource ID of your event hub where the Event Grid is configured to send events. |
    | storageAccountResourceId | *Resource ID* | The resource ID of your storage account that holds the data for ingestion. |
    | consumerGroup | *$Default* | The consumer group of your event hub.|
    | location | *Central US* | The location of the data connection resource.|
    | blobStorageEventType | *Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated* | The type of event that triggers ingestion. Supported events are: Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated or Microsoft.Storage.BlobRenamed. Blob renaming is supported only for ADLSv2 storage.|
    | databaseRouting | *Multi* or *Single* | The database routing for the connection. If you set the value to **Single**, the data connection will be routed to a single database in the cluster as specified in the *databaseName* setting. If you set the value to **Multi**, you can override the default target database using the *Database* [ingestion property](ingest-data-event-grid-overview.md#ingestion-properties). For more information, see [Events routing](ingest-data-event-grid-overview.md#events-routing). |
