reason why the true-positive rate is 100% for these two cases.
In practice, it is difﬁcult to conduct “smart” attacks that allow
the attacker to do the guessing and align the attacking signal
with the sensor output. In the experiment of a temperature
sensor system in Section VI-B, smart attacks are simulated
from real sensor data.
4) Signal Reconstruction: When no attack is detected,
the ﬁnal step is to recover the physical quantity. Because
measurements in Case 2 and 3 are detected with attacking
signals, we cannot recover the physical quantity from these
two cases. In Case 1, no attacking signal is detected, and we can

which is generated by modulating 1 kHz signal on a 144 MHz carrier signal at the power of −5 dBm; (c) the attacker transmits

and the speaker plays 1 kHz tone at the same time.

signal is presented.
recover the 1 kHz signal by excluding zero samples and edge
samples in the measurement. Then, we use a digital second-
order Butterworth low-pass ﬁlter with a cut-off frequency of
5 kHz to get rid of high-frequency components in the digitized
signal. The recovered 1 kHz signal is shown in Figure 10. As
a comparison, we also digitize 1 kHz audio signal with the
same ADC as a reference signal, and it is ﬁltered by the same
low-pass ﬁlter. The reference signal is depicted in Figure 10.
We analyze the quality of the recovered signal in two aspects:
similarity and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). As discussed in
Section VI-A2, PCC can be used to measure the similarity
between two signals. We calculate the PCCs between 100
recovered signals and the reference audio signal. The averaged
PCC in Case 1 is above 0.99, which implies that the recovered
signal is similar to the audio signal in the time domain.
The averaged SNR of all 100 recovered signals in Case 1
is 30.6 dB ± 0.1 dB at a 99% conﬁdence level; the SNR of
the reference signal is 29.9 dB. It can be concluded that the
recovered signal has a equivalent quality as the reference signal.
B. Temperature Sensor System
We use a thermistor to build a temperature sensor system.
The thermistor is a resistor that varies its resistance according
to temperature. In our experiment, we choose a thermistor with
Fig. 11: A thermistor circuit is a voltage divider. When the
temperature increases, the output voltage of the circuit increases
accordingly.
a negative temperature coefﬁcient (NTC), which means that
the resistance of the thermistor increases with decreasing the
temperature. In order to present experimental results properly,
we deﬁne that the temperature measuring range is from 0.0 ◦C
to 50.0 ◦C, which is within the allowable measuring range of
the thermistor.
In the following sections, we ﬁrst introduce the setup of
the temperature sensor system. Then, we demonstrate how an
attacking signal affects a sensor reading. Finally, we show that
our detection method can detect the attacking signal.
1) Setup: In Figure 11, we present a diagram of a thermistor
circuit. The thermistor circuit is a voltage divider, which is
formed by connecting an NTC thermistor and a resistor in series.
The output voltage of the thermistor circuit increases with
increasing the temperature. We test the thermistor circuit using
the setup shown in Figure 6, and we replace the microphone
module with the thermistor circuit. This setup is placed in
a laboratory with a constant temperature at around 25.0 ◦C.
Since the room temperature can be regarded as a constant
physical quantity, digitized samples that should be non-zero
are supposed to be approximately equal. The sampling rate
is set to 284 Hz, which is much lower than the one in the
microphone system.
The attacking signal has a frequency of 144 MHz, and it is
radiated from a 144 MHz omnidirectional antenna. The antenna
is placed 1 cm away from the thermistor circuit. Note that the
distance between the antenna and the thermistor circuit is small
In the following parts, a reference case (Case 1) is presented,
in which no attacking signal exists. A dumb attack (Case 2) is
conducted on the temperature sensor system, and then a smart
attack (Case 3) is simulated from data that are collected from
Case 1 and 2. In the following parts, the thermistor circuit’s
voltage outputs are converted into temperature. Note that when
the bias voltage is 0 V, the output is also 0 V. Since 0 V
corresponds to a temperature that is beyond the measurement
range of the thermistor circuit, this temperature is denoted as
Tref (see Figure 13).
Case 1: No attacking signal is radiated from the antenna, and
the microcontroller records the output of the thermistor circuit.
In Figure 13a, a measurement is presented. The measured
temperature is 25.5 ◦C ± 0.1 ◦C.
Case 2: In order to change the sensor reading to a signiﬁcant
high temperature, the antenna radiates an attacking signal with
a power of 19 dBm. The microcontroller records the output of
the thermistor circuit. A measurement is shown in Figure 13b.
Note that such an attack is a dumb attack, as the attacker
radiates the attacking signal continuously. The mean of the non-
zero samples corresponds to a temperature of 38.3 ◦C± 0.1 ◦C,
which is around 13 ◦C higher than the true room temperature.
The zero samples are lifted to 27.4 ◦C±0.1 ◦C, which indicates
an attack.
Case 3: (A simulation of a smart attack) The attacker has
a fair coin that has a probability of 50% showing a head and
50% showing a tail every time it is tossed. The attacker selects
a measurement from Case 1, and each measurement contains
4 clock cycles or 8 half clock cycles (see Figure 13a). For
each clock cycle, the attacker tosses the coin to decide whether
to send an attacking signal. A head means that the attacker
radiates an attacking signal in the ﬁrst half cycle and remains
silent in the second half cycle. Accordingly, the ﬁrst half cycle
is replaced by a half cycle that corresponds to 38.3 ◦C± 0.1 ◦C
from Case 2. Conversely, a tail means that the attacker remains
silent in the ﬁrst half cycle and radiates an attacking signal in
the second half cycle. Accordingly, the second half cycle is
replaced by a half cycle that is 27.4 ◦C ± 0.1 ◦C from Case
2. After tossing the coin for all four clock cycles, we have
a new measurement that is affected by a smart attack (see
Figure 13c).
As shown in Figure 13c, except for the third clock cycle, the
attacker’s guesses in the other three clock cycles are correct.
The attacker accidentally radiates the attacking signal during
the second half cycle of the third cycle: the temperature of that
half cycle is enhanced from Tref to 27.4 ◦C. After digitization,
non-zero samples form a non-constant signal, and thus an attack
can be detected. Also, since samples that should be Tref in
the third clock cycle are lifted, the attack is alarmed.
In each case, 100 measurements are recorded. In Case 2,
the true-positive rate is 100%, which implies that an attacking
signal is detected in each measurement. Also, we repeat the
simulation of smart attacks 100 times, and the true-positive
rate is 93%. In theory, since the number of digits of the secret
is four, the attacker has a probability of 1
24 guessing the secret
of each measurement correctly. Among 100 measurements, the
Fig. 12: The power of attacking signal is increased from
13 dBm to 19 dBm with a step of 0.5 dBm. Under the attack,
the temperature is changed from 24.9 ◦C to 37.9 ◦C.
because we want to realize the remote injection with a low
power of the R&S SMC 100A signal generator.
2) Without Detection Method: The thermistor circuit is
biased at 1 V. When no attacking signal is radiated, the
temperature sensor system outputs 24.9 ◦C ± 0.1 ◦C at a 99%
conﬁdence level.
Next, the attacker radiates an attacking signal, and the power
of the attacking signal is increased from 13 dBm to 19 dBm
with a step of 0.5 dBm. For each power level, 100 temperature
measurements are recorded. We calculate the 99% conﬁdence
interval around the mean of the 100 measurements, and results
are presented in Figure 12. Below 14 dBm, the attacking signal
has no signiﬁcant effect on the temperature measurement.
When the power of the attacking signal is increased above
14 dBm, the temperature measurements increases. The 19 dBm
attacking signal results in a temperature measurement of
37.9 ◦C ± 0.4 ◦C, which is approximately 13 ◦C higher than
the true room temperature of 24.9 ◦C ± 0.1 ◦C. The curve in
Figure 12 shows that the attacker can change the temperature
reading of the sensor to any values as she wishes. Without any
detection method, the temperature sensor system cannot detect
the existence of the attacking signal.

3) Applying Detection Method: The secret sequence we use
is also [1100], and the clock rate of the Manchester code is set
to 20 Hz. We use oscilloscope to measure the time of signal
edge, and the width of signal edge is around 2 ms. Regarding
that the sampling period is
284 Hz = 3.5 ms, at most one sample
is digitized from signal edges. In order to eliminate the negative
inﬂuence caused by samples from signal edges, the ﬁrst and
the last sample in each half clock cycle are abandoned.
We use the oscilloscope to measure the bound of non-zero
samples, which is 0.03 V; the bound of zero samples has the
same value. When no attacking signal is radiated, ﬂuctuations
of non-zero samples are within 0.03 V; note that zero samples
2 × 0.03 V = 0.015 V, as the ADC in
swing between 0 V and 1
the microcontroller can only read positive voltages. Because
the room temperature is a constant physical quantity, we can
concrete the requirements as follows:
• The standard deviation of all non-zero samples is smaller
than or equal to 1
2 × 0.03 V = 0.015 V.
• All zero samples are within [0, 0.015] V.

Fig. 13: Our detection method is deployed to the temperature sensor system, and the outputs of the thermistor circuit are

of 25.5 ◦C. In (b), a dumb attacking signal is radiated, and the non-zero samples indicate a room temperature of 38.3 ◦C, and

VII. DISCUSSION
A. Guaranteeing the Security with Small n for Constant
Physical Quantities
In Section IV-A, we have discussed that increasing the length
of the secret sequence n leads to increasing the difﬁculty of
bypassing the detection method. A larger n results in a more
secure system. Given a ﬁxed duration of a measurement, a
larger n requires a faster sampling rate of the ADC. Because of
the hardware limitations, the sampling rate has an upper limit,
and thus n also has a maximal value. Although the sampling
rate reaches the highest, it is possible that n is a small number
(e.g., n = 8). However, in our detection method, a small n can
also guarantee the security of the sensor system.
For each measurement, the number of combinations of n-bit
secret sequence is 2n, and the attacker can ﬁnd the correct
secret sequence to bypass the detection method by trying all
combinations. However, in practice, it is impossible for the
attacker to try 2n times, and the attacker has only one chance
to change the measurement. The probability of successfully
attacking the measurement without being detected is 1
2n , and
this means that the expected number of successful attacks in
attacking 2n measurements is only one. In the other 2n − 1
measurements, the attacking signal is discovered by the sensor
system. Imagine that the microcontroller receives 2n−1 invalid
measurements before one valid measurement. Because the
2n − 1 invalid measurements imply that the sensor system
is currently under an attack, the valid measurement is still
untrustworthy, and hence the microcontroller rejects to further
processing the valid measurement.
In general, we suggest using a large n (e.g., n = 128) to
guarantee the security of the sensor system. However, limited by
the sampling rate, although a substantial n may be impractical,
a relatively small n is still effective to prevent an attacker from
bypassing the detection method, and further, the security of
the sensor system is guaranteed.
B. Trade-off between Security and Speed
In some applications, the sampling rate of an ADC is ﬁxed.
To increase the security, we can lengthen the duration of one
measurement, and thus more sub-measurements are included.
If the physical quantity keeps constant after lengthening the
measurement, the number of sub-measurements that the attacker
must change increases. As a result, it is more difﬁcult for the
attacker to change all sub-measurements without being detected.
For non-constant physical quantities, to change the waveform
of the sensor output effectively, the attacker has to alter
more sub-measurements after lengthening the measurement.
Consequently, the difﬁculty of bypassing the detection method
also increases. Above all, without changing the sampling rate
of the ADC, the security of the sensor system can be further
improved at the cost of lengthening the measurement.
In summary, to achieve a more secure sensor system, we have
to sacriﬁce the speed, which is either the speed of sampling
or the speed of obtaining a measurement. In real applications,
designers need to consider the constraints of their sensor
systems to choose the proper option to enhance the security.
C. Our Approach for Non-Powered Passive Sensors
In order to deploy our approach to a sensor system with a
non-powered passive sensor, a switch can be added between the
sensor output and the ADC. Figure 14 depicts a conﬁguration
for the non-powered passive sensor. The microcontroller can
“turn on” and “turn off” the sensor by controlling the switch.
When the microcontroller “turns on” the sensor, the switch con-
nects the sensor output and the ADC; thus, the microcontroller
