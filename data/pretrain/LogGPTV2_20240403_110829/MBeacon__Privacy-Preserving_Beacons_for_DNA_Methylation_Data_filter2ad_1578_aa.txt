Abstract—The advancement of molecular proﬁling techniques
fuels biomedical research with a deluge of data. To facilitate
data sharing, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
established the Beacon system, a search engine designed to help
researchers ﬁnd datasets of interest. While the current Beacon
system only supports genomic data, other types of biomedical
data, such as DNA methylation, are also essential for advancing
our understanding in the ﬁeld. In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst
Beacon system for DNA methylation data sharing: MBeacon. As
the current genomic Beacon is vulnerable to privacy attacks, such
as membership inference, and DNA methylation data is highly
sensitive, we take a privacy-by-design approach to construct
MBeacon.
First, we demonstrate the privacy threat, by proposing a
membership inference attack tailored speciﬁcally to unprotected
methylation Beacons. Our experimental results show that 100
queries are sufﬁcient to achieve a successful attack with AUC
(area under the ROC curve) above 0.9. To remedy this situation,
we propose a novel differential privacy mechanism, namely SVT2,
which is the core component of MBeacon. Extensive experiments
over multiple datasets show that SVT2 can successfully mitigate
membership privacy risks without signiﬁcantly harming utility.
We further implement a fully functional prototype of MBeacon
which we make available to the research community.

INTRODUCTION
The advancement of molecular proﬁling technologies dur-
ing the last decade has resulted in a deluge of biomedical
data becoming available. The large quantity of data is consid-
ered the fuel for the next-generation bio-engineering industry.
Leading researchers as well as practitioners have predicted the
biotech era is coming.
Data sharing is essential for advancing biomedical research.
However, large-scale data sharing has been limited, primarily
due to privacy concerns [12], [22], [2], [24]. Homer et al. [16]
have shown that an adversary can effectively predict
the
presence of an individual in a genomic dataset. This attack
is known as membership inference attack [5], [35], [28],

[31] and its implication is beyond membership status: For
instance, if the dataset is collected from individuals carrying a
certain disease, then the adversary can immediately infer this
sensitive information about her target(s). A recent study [5]
further shows that not only genomic data, but also other types
of biomedical data, are vulnerable to membership inference
attacks.
Aiming for a responsible and effective genomic data shar-
ing solution, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH)1 established the Beacon system2 in 2014. The
Beacon system is essentially a search engine indexed over
multiple Beacons. Each single Beacon is constructed by a
partner institution of the Beacon system with its own database.
Only one type of query is supported by a Beacon: whether
its database contains any record with the speciﬁed nucleotide
at a given position and chromosome, and the corresponding
response is a binary “Yes” or “No”. Upon a query from a
researcher, the search engine, i.e., the Beacon system, will
return the names of the partner institutions that answer “Yes”,
and the researcher can directly contact these institutions to
obtain access to the data.
The current Beacon system only supports genomic data.
However, other types of biomedical data, like epigenetic data,
are also essential for biomedical research. In particular, DNA
methylation, as one of the most important epigenetic elements,
has been demonstrated to be very inﬂuential to human health.
For instance, anomalous changes in the DNA methylation
patterns are frequently observed in cancer [13]. Consequently,
there exists a huge demand for methylation data sharing.
A. Contributions
We construct the ﬁrst Beacon system for sharing DNA
methylation data, namely, the MBeacon system. Similar to
the current genomic Beacon system,
the MBeacon system
is also a search engine. Each institution taking part in the
MBeacon system establishes its own MBeacon that implements
the following query: “Are there any patients with a certain
methylation value at a speciﬁc methylation position?”, and
provides a binary “Yes” or “No” response.
Despite the coarse-grained answer format, researchers have

shown that

attacks, in particular membership inference attacks [36], [29],
[1], [45]. In addition, previous works have demonstrated the
serious privacy risks stemming from sharing DNA methyla-
tion data [3], [8]. Therefore, we follow a privacy-by-design
approach to construct the MBeacon system.
Membership Inference Attack. The ﬁrst step towards a
privacy-preserving MBeacon is to evaluate the privacy threat
of membership inference attacks against a plain (unprotected)
methylation Beacon. Since existing attacks on the current
Beacons are tailored to genomic data only, we design a
membership inference attack suitable for DNA methylation
data. Our membership inference attack relies on the likelihood-
ratio test and uses as probability estimate a normal distribution
calibrated to the mean and standard deviation of the general
population’s methylation values.
We empirically evaluate our attack on several unprotected
methylation Beacons composed of various methylation datasets
and show that the attack achieves a superior performance. For
instance, the simulated attacker can achieve an AUC value
(area under the ROC curve) of over 0.9 after submitting only
100 queries to the Beacon.
Defense Mechanism. The effectiveness of our membership
inference attack demonstrates the privacy threat of the Bea-
con system for methylation data. To mitigate this threat, we
propose a novel differential privacy mechanism, namely the
double sparse vector technique (SVT2), which is the core
component of MBeacon. We consider a MBeacon’s query
response to be highly privacy-sensitive if it differs from the ex-
pected response over the general population data. In fact, these
differences are also the major reason why our membership
inference attack is effective. A MBeacon is usually constructed
over a database collected from people with a certain disease,
and biomedical studies show that, for data of this kind, only a
few methylation regions differ from the general population.
As a consequence, only a few queries are highly privacy-
sensitive. Therefore, we aim for a solution that scales noise
to the sensitive responses in order to reduce the overall noise
level of MBeacon, thus maintaining utility.
One possible solution for the problem is the sparse vector
technique, a differential privacy mechanism that is designed to
scale noise to a subset of highly privacy-sensitive responses.
The sparse vector technique determines whether a response
is sensitive by comparing it to a ﬁxed threshold. However, it
cannot be applied to MBeacon, as we need to check whether
the MBeacon response and the expected response agree with
each other. The novelty of our proposed SVT2 lies in checking
this agreement through two comparisons to a ﬁxed threshold:
one for the MBeacon response, the other for the expected
response. We prove that SVT2 guarantees differential privacy.
Utility Metrics. The goal of the MBeacon system is to
facilitate DNA methylation data sharing. Therefore, the main
users of the system are researchers who want to discover
institutions that possess data of interest. In order to quantify
the impact of SVT2 on the real-world utility of our MBeacon
system, we introduce a new utility metric by simulating a
legitimate researcher who tries to ﬁnd other institutions that
possess methylation data similar to her own data.
We evaluate the performance of our privacy-preserving
MBeacon through extensive experiments (simulating 2,100
researchers). The results show that the privacy loss on member-
ship inference attacks can be minimized while the researcher
utility still remains high. For carefully chosen privacy param-
eters, it is possible to decrease the attacker’s performance to
random guessing (AUC  0.8). Furthermore, we conduct
a large-scale evaluation of privacy parameters for SVT2 and
provide the necessary tools for an institution to tune these
parameters to their needs.
In addition, we have implemented a fully-functional pro-
totype of the MBeacon system3 which we make available to
the research community.
B. Organization
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We brieﬂy
introduce the current Beacon system and necessary biomedical
background in Section II. MBeacon is formally deﬁned in
Section III. Section IV and V present our membership infer-
ence attack and its evaluation, respectively. In Section VI, we
describe our defense mechanism SVT2. Section VII introduces
the utility metric. The effectiveness of our defense is evaluated
in Section VIII. The MBeacon prototype is introduced in
Section IX. We summarize the related work in Section X, and
then conclude in Section XI.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide the necessary background on
the current Beacon system as well as on DNA methylation.
A. Beacon System
Current biomedical data sharing has limited success due to
its inherent privacy risks. To tackle this problem, GA4GH has
established the Beacon system, also referred to as the Beacon
network.
The Beacon system is a search engine that allows re-
searchers to query whether any of the institutions taking part
in the system possesses data of their interests. Each partner
institution implements its own Beacon with its onsite data.
These Beacons only support one simple type of query, i.e.,
the presence of a speciﬁed nucleotide (A, C, G, T) at a
given position within a certain chromosome. The response is
a binary “Yes” or “No”. To give a concrete example, query
“13 : 32936732 G > C” stands for ”Are there any patients
that have allele C at position 32936732 (with reference allele
G) on chromosome 13?”. When the Beacon system receives
such a query, it forwards the query to each of its partner
institutions’ Beacons. If an institution’s dataset contains at
least one record matching the query, then the Beacon answers
“Yes”. The names of all Beacons with “Yes” answers are sent
back to the querier. In the end, the querier can contact the
corresponding institutions for data access ofﬂine.
B. DNA Methylation
DNA methylation is one of the most important and best
understood epigenetic elements. It consists of molecules, so-
called methyl groups, added to the nucleotides at positions

MBeacon responses “Yes” if there are
p ≥ T patients with the requested value
where a C nucleotide is followed by a G nucleotide (called
CpG-dinucleotides). Usually, DNA methylation at a given
CpG-dinucleotide is measured as a real value between 0 and 1.
This value represents the fraction of methylated dinucleotides
at this position. The whole DNA methylation proﬁle of an
individual can thus be represented as a vector of real values
between 0 and 1. Intermediate values occur due to DNA
methylation varying between copies of the DNA within the
same cell, or due to mixtures of cells from different tissues
being measured.
Whether the DNA is methylated at certain positions affects
the DNA activity and structure [17], [33]. Some anomalous
changes in methylation patterns are correlated with cancer [13],
leading to activation of genes such as oncogenes, or the si-
lencing of tumor suppressor genes. Meanwhile, environmental
factors, such as pollution, smoking and stress, can cause the
changes of methylation values [7], [40], [42], [41]. Therefore,
an increasing number of studies concentrate on methylation,
which require large amounts of DNA methylation data, and
thus data sharing.
In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst Beacon system for
sharing DNA methylation data, namely the MBeacon system.
Since an individual’s methylation data may carry information
about her current disease status and environmental factors
inﬂuencing her health, methylation data is considered highly
privacy-sensitive. Also, a recent study has shown that methy-
lation data can be re-identiﬁed by inferring the corresponding
genomes [3] given an individual’s methylation proﬁle. There-
fore, our MBeacon system is built following a privacy-by-
design approach.
III. MBEACON DESIGN
The MBeacon system is a search engine that
indexes
over multiple MBeacons. Each MBeacon is established by
an institution with its own database, and this institution is
referred to as a partner of the MBeacon system. We denote an
institution by I and its MBeacon by BI. Without ambiguity, we
also use I to represent the institution’s database itself, which
consists of multiple patients’ methylation proﬁles. Moreover,
we denote a patient by v, and her methylation proﬁle, i.e., the
sequenced methylation values, by a vector m(v) ∈ RM
[0,1]. The
3
vector length M is equal to the total number of methylation
positions considered, e.g., M = 450, 000.
Similar to the genomic Beacon, our MBeacon supports one
type of query, that is “Are there any patients with this methy-
lation value at a speciﬁc methylation position?”. Formally, we
deﬁne a query q as a tuple (pos, val ) where pos represents
the queried position and val represents the queried value. A
Beacon BI is essentially a function,
BI : q → {0, 1},
(1)
where 0 represents “No” and 1 represents “Yes”. It is worth
noting that this general query format also allows researchers
to infer answers to more complex queries, such as “Are there
any patients with methylation value above some threshold for
a speciﬁc position?”. When a researcher issues a query to the
MBeacon system, the system forwards this query to all the
MBeacons, and returns the names of those MBeacons with
“Yes” answers to the researcher.
For presentation purposes, we summarize the notations
introduced here and in the following sections in Table I.
IV. MEMBERSHIP INFERENCE ATTACK
To demonstrate the privacy risks of unprotected methy-
lation Beacons, we propose a membership inference attack
against them. In this section, we ﬁrst present the considered
adversarial model, then the methodology of our attack.
