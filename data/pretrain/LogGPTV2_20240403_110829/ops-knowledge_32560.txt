User: I am making a crawler to download some images extensively and I want to speed up by using thread (I'm new to multithreading). I am not sure about the inner mechanism behind disk writing operation. Can I write different files to disk simultaneously using thread? (does the writing get scheduled automatically?) Or should I make a lock for disk access for each thread to take turns and write?
Assistant: There's no point. Disk write operations aren't blocking anyway, so there's no point in creating many threads just to perform them.
