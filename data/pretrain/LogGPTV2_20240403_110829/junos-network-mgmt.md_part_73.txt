# Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics Software Installation and Configuration

## Overview
The Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software is designed to test the FPGA module in the QFX-PFA-4Q expansion module installed on a QFX5100-24Q-AA switch, as well as the data paths between the FPGA module and the switch. The software includes standard diagnostics, orchestration diagnostics, Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and synchronization diagnostics, and additional utilities for further diagnostics.

### Prerequisites
- **Junos OS Version**: Ensure that your QFX5100 switch is running Junos OS Release 14.1X53-D27 or later with enhanced automation.
- **Service Contract**: Access to the download site requires a service contract with Juniper Networks and an access account. If you need an account, register at [Juniper Networks](https://www.juniper.net/registration/Register.jsp).

## Installation and Configuration Steps

### 1. Verify the QFX-PFA-4Q Expansion Module Installation
Before installing the Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software, ensure that the QFX-PFA-4Q module is installed. Use the following command to check the hardware inventory:

```shell
root> show chassis hardware
```

Example output:
```shell
Hardware inventory:
Item                  Version  Part number    Serial number  Description
Chassis               VX3715020024  QFX5100-24Q-AA
...
PIC 1                 REV 01   711-060247    VY3115060052   QFX-PFA-4Q
...
```

### 2. Download the Packet Flow Diagnostics Software
To download the software from the Juniper Networks Support website, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to [Juniper Networks Support](https://www.juniper.net/support).
2. Click "Download Software."
3. In the Switching section, click "Junos OS Platforms."
4. Select the platform and release version.
5. Choose the appropriate install package.
6. Log in and agree to the End User License Agreement.
7. Save the `pfadiag_vm-rXXXXX.img.gz` file to your local system or a remote location accessible via HTTP, TFTP, FTP, or SCP.

### 3. Copy the Packet Flow Diagnostics Software Package to the Switch
Use any file transfer protocol to copy the package to the switch. For example, using SCP:

```shell
root% scp //hostname/pathname/pfadiag_vm-rXXXXX.img.gz /var/tmp
```

### 4. Install the Packet Flow Diagnostics Software on the Switch
Install the software package with the following command:

```shell
root> request system software add virtual-machine-package /var/tmp/pfadiag_vm-rXXXXX.img.gz
```

Verify the installation with:

```shell
root> show version
```

### 5. Configure the Guest VM Options
Configure the guest VM options in the Junos OS CLI:

1. Set the compute cluster and node names:
   ```shell
   root# set services app-engine compute-cluster default-cluster compute-node default-node hypervisor
   ```

2. Set the VM instance name and third-party package name:
   ```shell
   root# set services app-engine virtual-machines instance diagnostics package pfadiag_vm-rXXXXX-ve
   ```

3. Associate the VM instance with the compute cluster and node:
   ```shell
   root# set services app-engine virtual-machines instance diagnostics compute-cluster default-cluster compute-node default-node
   ```

4. Configure the local management IP address:
   ```shell
   root# set services app-engine virtual-machines instance diagnostics local-management family inet address 192.168.1.10
   ```

5. Configure the management interface for the guest VM:
   ```shell
   root# set services app-engine virtual-machines instance diagnostics management-interface em1
   ```

6. Commit the configuration:
   ```shell
   root# commit
   ```

### 6. Verify the Guest VM
Check the status of the guest VM with the following commands:

```shell
root> show app-engine status
root> show app-engine virtual-machine instance
root> show app-engine virtual-machine package
```

### 7. Access the Guest VM
Log into the guest VM using the following command:

```shell
root> request app-engine virtual-machine-shell diagnostics
```

Enter the username `root` and create a password when prompted.

### 8. Verify the FPGA Module
Use the following commands to verify the FPGA module:

```shell
[root@ikondiag ~]# lspci | grep "RAM memory"
[root@ikondiag ~]# lspci | grep Co-processor
[root@ikondiag ~]# maxtop
```

### 9. Validate Connections Between Switch Ports and QFX-PFA-4Q Module Ports
To validate the connections, configure a VLAN and use the `ikon_eth_util --all-pass-through` utility:

1. Create a VLAN:
   ```shell
   user@switch # set vlans VLAN_TEST vlan-id 100
   ```

2. Associate the F-port and A-port with the VLAN:
   ```shell
   user@switch # set interfaces xe-0/0/10:2 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members VLAN_TEST
   user@switch # set interfaces xe-0/0/32 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members VLAN_TEST
   ```

3. Commit the configuration:
   ```shell
   user@switch # commit synchronize
   ```

4. Verify the VLAN:
   ```shell
   user@switch # show vlans
   ```

5. Run the `ikon_eth_util --all-pass-through` command in the guest VM:
   ```shell
   [root@ikondiag ~]# ikon_eth_util --all-pass-through
   ```

By following these steps, you can successfully install, configure, and validate the Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software on your QFX5100-24Q-AA switch.
