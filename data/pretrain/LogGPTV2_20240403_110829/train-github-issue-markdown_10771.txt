From the docs on static HTML export:

> object passed to getInitialProps. You can't use req or res fields.
Does static export entirely negate the ability to use the _error.js component
for error handling, which is dependent on `res`? How would I go about creating
a 404 page?
The current behavior is that any unknown routes redirect to `/index.js`.
One possible solution I can think of is to maintain a list of all routes and
check against it to see if pathname is found. However this seems especially
onerous to run on every page load for a site/blog that generates 100s of
routes.
Is there a way to do this?  
Or is it possible to define a custom error route and redirect to that instead?  
Or even better, catch all routes within subfolders? eg
     {
        ...routes,
         '/*': { page: '/_error.js' },
        '/blog/*': { page: '/blog/_error.js' },
      }
