Code as of `6088134`
  * Your Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.86]
  * What you're doing and what's happening:
  1. Clicked the dropdown in the upper right corner
  2. Clicked Settings
  3. Code launched with profiles.json in a compact form
  4. Formatted the JSON so I could more easily read and edit it
  5. Saved the file
  6. File is immediately reloaded and put back into compact, unformatted form, making it difficult to edit again.
  * What's wrong / what should be happening instead:
  1. Expect formatting to persist after saving a change or if the app needs to modify it after detecting a change to at least format it with indentation / beautify / formatter
