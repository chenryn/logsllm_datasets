title:botconf2017 Python and Machine Learning: How to Clusterize a Malware Dataset
The goal of this workshop is to present how to use python to make machine learning. We take examples of security data like malware and we explain how to transform data to use algorithms of machine learning. We detail the different algorithms and the different librairies Scikit-learn and Tensorflow.The algorithms help to clusterize quickly a database malware to create yara signature for using in Incident Response. The participants will work on little dataset and develop some code based on theses librairies and create yara signature.
