User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Shellshock: How do I know if my server is compromised + suspicious files to look out for Three questions which I hope someone can help answer:


How do I know if my server is already compromised due to the Shellshock bug ?
If it was compromised, is there a particular folder where I should look for malicious files?
How does a malicious file look like?


I'm running CentOS 6, LEMP stack

Assistant: How do I know if my server is already compromised due to the Shellshock bug?


You don't. That's the idea of a security vulnerability. If you had to click Let the crackers in? OK/Cancel it wouldn't be much of a vulnerability.

You may have some luck checking the logs of your attack vectors, but given that so many services are vulnerable and not all of them log every access, it's likely not possible to conclusively find an attack.


  If it was compromised, is there a particular folder where I should look for malicious files?


No, a malicious file could be anywhere.

Common rootkits install themselves in /root or / or /tmp or one of the binary paths but really they could be anywhere. They might have a name similar to a real service or something "important" looking like "IPTables" or "kernel-bin" but they could also be random strings of characters or the same name as a genuine binary (just in a different path). You can spot a really obvious rootkit loading in /etc/rc.local or making connections via netstat -neopa. Look for suspicious process names in top -c.

A less common and much more difficult to find rootkit replaces a library or loads itself as a shim library and intercepts system calls. This is almost impossible to find unless you strace/ltrace every single thing running on your system and compare the behaviour with the expected behaviour of a known-good system or source code.

It would be quicker, easier, and more conclusive to just reload the system.


  How does a malicious file look like?


Probably like any other regular ELF binary or library. It may also be a script.

In conclusion, if you think there's a possibility that your system has been compromised, treat the system as if it has been compromised and take necessary measures.
