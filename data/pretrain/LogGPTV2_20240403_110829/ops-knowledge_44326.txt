User: In the old (non-Ajax) Google Appengine's Developer Console Dashboard - showed estimated cost for the last 'n' hours. This was useful to quickly tell how the App engine is doing vis-a-vis the daily budget.
This field seems to be missing in the new Appengine Developer Console. I have tried to search various tabs on the Console and looked for documentation, but without success.
Looking for any pointers as to how do I get to this information in the new Console and any help/pointers are highly appreciated !
Assistant: App Engine > Dashboard
This view shows how much you are charged so far during the current billing day, and how many hours you still have until the reset of the day. This is equivalent to what the old console was showing, except there is no "total" line under all charges.
App Engine > Quotas
This view shows how much of each daily quota have been used.
App Engine > Quotas > View Usage History
This view gives you a summary of costs for each of the past 90 days. Clicking on a day gives you a detailed break-down of all charges for that day.
