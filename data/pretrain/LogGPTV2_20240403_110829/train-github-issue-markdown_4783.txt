https://github.com/BMayhew/playwright-demo
**Steps**
  * Run the test in this sample repo in local mode, you could run just single smoke test npx playwright test -g "Register a new user @smoke"
  * observe the test time it took including tear down time, lets call it A
  * Now start a playwright server on some different remote machine
  * Now, change the config to run the same test with connectOption with remote browser url
  * Observe the test time it took including tear down time, lets call B
  * Now, turn off tracing and rerun the test
  * Observe the test time and tear down time again, lets call it C
**Expected**  
Time increase should between B and C should not be abnormally high.
**Actual**  
Time increases drastically for just 6MB of trace file, for 30sec test it
increased to 2-3 mins.
