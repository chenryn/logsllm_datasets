##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 4.1.2
  * Operating System / Platform => Windows 7 64 bit
  * Compiler => Python 3.7.3 (v3.7.3:ef4ec6ed12, Mar 25 2019, 22:22:05) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
##### Detailed description
I've tuned a pre-trained tensorflow model using the object_detection API.  
After freezing the model and using the "tf_text_graph_ssd.py" script (the pre-
trained model I used was SSD_inception_v2_coco) I generated the graph.pbtxt
file.  
Each time I try to load the model with  
`cv.readNetFromTensorflow("frozen_inference_graph.pb", "graph.pbtxt")`  
Windows immediately says Python stopped working and crashes.  
The same thing happens when I try to use it in C++.
##### Steps to reproduce
    import cv2 as cv
    cv.readNetFromTensorflow("frozen_inference_graph.pb", "graph.pbtxt")
frozen_inference_graph.pb
