User: I would like to write a script to automate a task which I do manually everyday. This task requires me to download some files from a UNIX server (Solaris) to my desktop (Windows XP) using WinSCP. Is there any way to copy/move the files from a path in the UNIX server to a path in my Windows XP PC using Python or shell script?
Assistant: If you are planning to use python, then you can use paramiko library. It has sftp support. Once you have the file on windows, use shutils library to move it to your path on windows
