dently ﬁxed probability as the loss rate of the link.
For a Gilbert model, the link ﬂuctuates between a good
state (no packet dropped) and a bad state (all packets
dropped). According to Paxon’s observed measure-
ment of Internet [31], the probability of remaining in
bad state is set to be 35% as in [10]. Thus, the Gilbert
model is more likely to generate bursty losses than the
Bernoulli model. The other state transition probabili-
ties are selected so that the average loss rates matches
the loss rate assigned to the link.
We repeat our experiments ﬁve times for each simulation
conﬁguration unless denoted otherwise, where each repe-
tition has a new topology and new loss rate assignments.
The path loss rate is simulated based on the transmission
of 10000 packets. Using the loss rates of selected paths as
input, we compute xG, then the loss rates of all other paths.
220000 is the largest topology we can simulate on a 1.5GHz
Pentium 4 machine with 512M memory.
