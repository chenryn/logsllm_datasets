Hi,  
I have a suite of tests that takes ~3 minutes **without** using the awesome
video feature and ~4+ minutes (133%) **with** the video feature.
I looked at the logs and saw that each context closing takes few more seconds
than without video.
    2021-02-08T10:52:04.726Z pw:api => browserContext.close started
    2021-02-08T10:52:15.962Z pw:api  browserContext.close started
    2021-02-08T10:51:20.406Z pw:api <= browserContext.close succeeded
    Success notification after 9 seconds
Is there a way to prevent this duration increase?
