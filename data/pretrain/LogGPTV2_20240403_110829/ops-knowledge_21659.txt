User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Observe the following logs
 0 14:41:57 combo klogd 1.4.1, log source = /proc/kmsg started.
 1 14:41:57 combo portmap startup succeeded
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*> 和 check pass; user unknown
B: portmap startup succeeded 和 klogd <*>.<*>.<*>, log source = /proc/kmsg started.
C: check pass; user unknown 和 session opened for user <*> by (uid=<*>)
D: session opened for user <*> by (uid=<*>) 和 session closed for user <*>

Assistant: Answer: B
