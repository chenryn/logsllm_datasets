I would like to propose adding a new feature: displaying a nested menu when hovering over an item.

After reviewing the source code, I noticed that the new menu is currently rendered within the `<body>` tag. I am unsure how to modify the code to enable this hover functionality for the menu items. Could you please provide guidance or assistance on how to implement this?

Thank you!
