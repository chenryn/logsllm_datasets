User: (I am using Python and ArchLinux)
I am writing a simple AI in Python as a school project. Because it is a school project, and I would like to visibly demonstrate what it is doing, my intention is to have a different terminal window displaying printed output from each subprocess- one terminal showing how sentences are being parsed, one showing what pyDatalog is doing, one for the actual input-output chat, etc, possibly on two monitors. 
From what I know, which is not much, a couple of feasible ways to go about this are threading each subprocess and figuring out display from there, or writing/using a library which allows me to make and configure my own windows. 
My question is, then, are those the best ways, or is there an easy way to output to multiple terminals simultaneously. Also, if making my own windows (and I'm sorry if my terminology is wrong when I say 'making my own windows'. I mean building my own output areas in Python) is the best option, I'm looking for which library I should use for that.
Assistant: I like @ebarr's answer, but a quick and dirty way to do it is to write to several files. You can then open multiple terminals and tail the files.
