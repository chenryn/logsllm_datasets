User: I can't run my PyCharm IDE using port 80.
I need to use PayPal that requires me to use port 80.
But using Mac OS X 10.8 I can't have it working because of permission issues.
I've already tried running PyCharm with SUDO command.
Does anyone know how to run Pycharm using port 80, or any other solution?
Thanks.
Assistant: To give PyCharm permissions, one has to run as Administor (Windows) or using sudo if on OSX/Linux: sudo /Applications/PyCharm.app/Contents/MacOS/pycharm.  Note that this truly runs PyCharm as a new user, so you'll have to register the app again and set up your customizations again if you have any (ie theme, server profiles etc)
