size and depth.

APPENDIX
A. OBTAINING M DJ FROM S0, SDJ AND M
IN TIME O(L3)
We recall that S0=(s0, ··· , sl−1) and S(j)
sdj +l−1). First, we compute
0 =Sdj =(sdj , ··· ,
Sl−1 = (sl−1,··· , s2l−2) = S0 · M l−1
Sdj +l−1 = (sdj +l−1,··· , sdj +2l−1) = Sdj · M l−1 .
Then the following equation holds.

If we denote the above equation by Adj =A0·M dj , then Adj
and A0 are both nonsingular, more generally, Proposition 2
holds.
Proposition 2. Suppose that L(1) is an l-bit LF RS with
a period of 2l−1 and update matrix M , denote its state at
time i by Si=(si, ··· , si+l−1) with initial state S0, then for
each i≥0, matrix

is nonsingular.
Proof. As L(1) has a period of 2l−1, we have Si=Si+2l−1
and si=si+2l−1. Hence, it follows that Ai=Ai+2l−1. Since
every non-zero state appears exactly once per period, there
exists a d such that 0≤d≤2l−2 and
Sd = (sd,··· , sd+l−2, sd+l−1) = (0,··· , 0, 1) .
Thus, Ad is nonsingular since it can be written as

Due to the equation
Ai = Ai+2l−1 = Ad · M i+2l−1−d
where both Ad and M are nonsingular, it follows that Ai is
nonsingular.
Therefore, we can obtain M dj eﬃciently by computing A
