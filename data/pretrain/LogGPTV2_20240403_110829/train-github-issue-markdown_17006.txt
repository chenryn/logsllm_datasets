Hi all,
first and foremost, thanks very much for Next.js. It's great.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
In versions prior to 5, our ssr was functioning as expected for every page.
## Current Behavior
Since we upgraded to 5, the page mapped as in  
https://github.com/em-casa/frontend/blob/master/server.js#L39  
started flashing 404 and displaying if rendered server-side (losing the
context).
I ended up making a bare-bones page just to make sure, see  
https://github.com/em-casa/frontend/blob/fix-filtered-calls-to-
url/pages/listings/index.js  
and it still happens.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. In production: https://emcasa.com/imoveis
  2. A branch that if cloned will reproduce the issue without needing the backend:  
https://github.com/em-casa/frontend/tree/fix-filtered-calls-to-url
  3. If testing locally, the page in question is `localhost:3000/imoveis`
## Context
I tried to make sure this isn't an Express issue or anything of the sort.
Wonder if anyone has been experiencing something similar. Any help will be
greatly appreciated.
