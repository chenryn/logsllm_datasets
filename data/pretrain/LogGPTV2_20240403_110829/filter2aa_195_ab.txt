## Online Resources
Check these websites for additional information:
- **www.apple.com/xserve**: Provides information about your server hardware and optional features.
- **www.apple.com/server**: Offers documents that provide useful background on setting up and using the server, including:
  - Understanding and Using NetInfo: Describes the built-in Mac OS X directory service and provides instructions for configuring NetInfo and Mac OS X Server.
  - Integrating Mac OS X With Active Directory: Explains how to use Microsoft’s Active Directory to authenticate Macintosh users and provide file services and home directories.
  - Upgrading to Mac OS X Server: Contains guidelines for migrating data and settings from existing servers.

## Software Update for Xserve
Depending on the software version installed on your Xserve system, you may need to download and install a software update. You can get automatic updates by using the software update command-line tool (when logged in remotely as “root”). This tool lists available updates, allowing you to choose the appropriate one. For more information, see the Mac OS X Server documentation.

For optimal performance, keep your system updated with the latest software.

## Installing or Restoring Software on Your Xserve System
Mac OS X Server is preinstalled on the drive module of your Xserve system. If the software has issues or needs reinstallation, you can use several methods to complete the installation. All methods involve using a remote computer or another Xserve system. Note that for any method using command-line tools, you must be logged in as root.

### Installation Methods
1. **Using Another Xserve System**:
   - Remove the drive module from your Xserve system and use another Xserve system with an optical drive to install the software.
2. **Starting Up from an External FireWire Optical Drive**:
   - Use an external FireWire optical drive with the Mac OS X Server install disc to start up and install the software.
3. **Putting the Xserve System in Target Disk Mode**:
   - Connect a PowerBook, iBook, or other Mac via a FireWire port to install the software.
4. **Network Installation**:
   - Use a NetBoot image or the Apple Software Restore (asr) command-line tool to install the software over the network.

**Important**: Remote installation of Mac OS X Server erases the target volume. Ensure you back up any important data before proceeding.

### Using a Second Xserve System to Install Server Software
This method is straightforward but requires a second Xserve system with an optical drive. You can install software using either the Terminal application and command-line tools or Server Assistant.

#### Using Command-Line Tools
1. Shut down your Xserve system and remove its drive module.
2. On a second Xserve system, unmount and remove one of the drive modules (or a blank module) and insert the drive module from your system.
3. Insert the server install CD into the second system’s optical drive.
4. Log in to the second system as root.
5. As the root user, type the following command:
   ```bash
   % installer -pkg /Volumes/Mac\OS\X\Server\Install\CD/System/Installation/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg -target /Volumes/ -lang
   ```
6. Open System Preferences on the second Xserve system and select the original startup volume.
7. Unmount the volume on which you just restored the software.
8. Remove the drive module with the restored software from the second system, put it in your Xserve system, and restart the system.
9. Replace the drive module or the blank module you removed from the second Xserve system and restart that system.

#### Using Server Assistant
1. Shut down your Xserve system and remove its drive module.
2. On a second Xserve system, unmount and remove one of the drive modules (or a blank module) and insert the drive module from your system.
3. Insert the server install CD into the second system’s optical drive.
4. Restart the second Xserve system from the server install CD.
5. Use Server Assistant on a remote computer to install the software.
6. Quickly remove your drive module from the second system before it finishes starting up.
7. Insert the drive module in your Xserve system and start it up.
8. Use the administration tools on a remote computer to finish setting up your server.

### Starting Up From an External FireWire Optical Drive
If you have an external FireWire optical drive, you can use it to start up your Xserve system from the Mac OS X Server install disc. Once started, you can use Server Assistant on a remote computer to install the software.

1. Shut down your Xserve system.
2. Press the handle of the drive module to open it.
3. Connect the external optical drive to the FireWire port on the system’s front panel.
4. Turn on the optical drive and insert the server install disc.
5. Start up your Xserve system.
6. When the system starts up from the disc, press the handle on the drive module to close it.
7. Use Server Assistant on a remote computer to install the software.
8. Unmount the volume on which you just installed the software.
9. Turn off the system by holding the power button for 5 seconds.

### Connecting Another Mac with the Xserve System in Target Disk Mode
You can connect a PowerBook, iBook, Xserve, or other Mac directly to your Xserve system using a FireWire port. The Xserve system must be in target disk mode.

1. Remove any FireWire devices connected to the Xserve system.
2. Use the front panel mode to put the system into target disk mode.
3. Connect a PowerBook, iBook, or other Mac to the FireWire port on the system’s front panel.
4. Turn on the connected computer and insert the server install disc.
5. Begin the installation process from the server install disc and install on the mounted volume of your installation drive.

### Using Front Panel Mode on an Xserve System
Xserve systems with a slot-loading optical drive can enter limited commands using the system identifier button on the front panel.

1. With the power off, hold the system identifier button while pressing the power button.
2. Continue holding the button until the top row of blue lights blinks sequentially and the rightmost light in the bottom row turns on.
3. Release the button, then press it again to light the next button in the bottom row, moving from right to left.
4. When the light for the desired action is on, hold the button for at least 2 seconds until all lights in the top row are on.
5. Release the button.

### Installing and Restoring from a Network Server
You can use a remote computer to install server software on one or multiple systems. Two methods particularly useful for multiple installations are Network Install and the Apple Software Restore (asr) command.

For more information on using command-line tools, see Chapter 17, "Tools for Advanced Administrators," in the Mac OS X Server Administrator’s Guide. For details on starting up or installing over the network, see Chapters 12 and 13, "NetBoot" and "Network Install," respectively.
