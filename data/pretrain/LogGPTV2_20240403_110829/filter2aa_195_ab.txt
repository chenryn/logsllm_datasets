Software Update for Xserve
Depending on the software version installed on your Xserve system, you may need to 
download and install a software update. You can get automatic software updates by using the 
software update command-line tool (when logged in remotely as “root”). This procedure lists 
any available updates for your system; you can choose the appropriate update. See the 
Mac OS X Server documentation for additional information.
For best performance, keep your system current with the latest software updates.
Installing or Restoring Software on Your Xserve System
Mac OS X Server is preinstalled on the drive module of your Xserve system. If the software 
has a problem or you need to reinstall or restore the server software, you can use one of 
several methods to complete installation. 
All of these installation methods involve using a remote computer or another Xserve system. 
Note:  For any method that uses command-line tools, you must be logged in as root.
The installation methods include:
m Removing the drive module from your Xserve system and using another Xserve system 
that has an optical drive to install the software on that drive module 
m Starting up from an external FireWire optical drive that has the Mac OS X Server install 
disc in it
m Putting the Xserve system in target disk mode and connecting a PowerBook, iBook, or 
other Mac by means of a FireWire port on the Xserve system
m Installing the software over the network, using a NetBoot image or using the command-
line tool Apple Software Restore (asr)
Important  Remote installation of Mac OS X Server erases the target volume. Be sure to 
back up other information on that volume.
16
Using a Second Xserve System to Install Server Software 
This is a simple method for installing or restoring software, but you must have a second 
Xserve system with an optical drive to do it. You can install software with a second system 
using either of these methods:
m The Terminal application and command-line tools
m Server Assistant
To use a second Xserve system and command-line tools:
1
Shut down your Xserve system and remove its drive module.
2
On a second Xserve system, unmount and remove one of the drive modules (or a blank 
module) and insert the drive module from your system.
Note:  You should not remove the startup drive module from the second system.
3
Insert the server install CD that came with your Xserve system in the second system’s optical 
drive.
4
Use an administrator computer to log in to the second system as root.
See Chapter 17, “Tools for Advanced Administrators,” in the Mac OS X Server 
Administrator’s Guide for more information about using command-line tools with the 
Terminal application.
5
As the root user type the following command:
% installer
    -pkg /Volumes/Mac\OS\X\Server\Install\CD/System/Installation/
Packages/OSInstall.mpkg
    -target /Volumes/ 
    -lang 
6
While still logged in as root, open System Preferences on the second Xserve system and 
select the original startup volume for that system.
You must change the startup disk because the remote installation set the drive you inserted 
into the second system as its startup disk.
7
Unmount the volume on which you just restored the software.
8
Remove the drive module with the restored software from the second system, put it in your 
Xserve system, and restart the system.
9
Replace the drive module or the blank module you removed from the second Xserve system 
and restart that system.
17
To use a second Xserve system and Server Assistant:
1
Shut down your Xserve system and remove its drive module.
2
On a second Xserve system, unmount and remove one of the drive modules (or a blank 
module) and insert the drive module from your system.
Note:  You should not remove the startup drive module from the second system.
3
Insert the server install CD that came with your Xserve system in the second system’s optical 
drive.
4
Restart the second Xserve system from the server install CD using one of these procedures:
m If the system has a tray-loading optical drive, hold in the system identiﬁer button as you 
press the power button. Continue holding in the system identiﬁer button until the drive 
tray opens. Insert the server install disc and close the tray.
m If the system has a slot-loading optical drive, use the front panel mode to start up from 
the optical drive. See “Using Front Panel Mode on an Xserve System” on page 19 for 
instructions; use light 1.
5
Do one of the following:
m Use Server Assistant on a remote computer to install the software on the drive module 
from your Xserve system. (See “Remote Installation” in Chapter 1 of Getting Started With 
Mac OS  X Server for details.)
m If you have a monitor and keyboard available for the second Xserve, double-click “Install 
Mac OS X Server.”
When software installation is complete, the second system will restart.
6
Quickly remove your drive module from the second system before that system ﬁnishes 
starting up.
7
Insert the drive module in your Xserve system and start it up.
8
Use the administration tools on a remote computer to ﬁnish setting up your server.
Starting Up From an External FireWire Optical Drive
If you have an external optical drive with a FireWire port, you can use it to start up your 
Xserve system from the Mac OS X Server install disc. Once you’ve started up from the 
external drive, you can use Server Assistant on a remote computer to install the software.
To start up from an external optical drive:
1
Shut down your Xserve system.
2
Press the handle of the drive module to open it, which assures that the drive won’t be 
recognized during startup.
3
Connect the external optical drive to the FireWire port on the system’s front panel.
18
4
Turn on the optical drive and insert the server install disc.
5
Start up your Xserve system.
After a few moments, the system begins starting up from the disc in the optical drive.
6
When you hear the disc in the optical drive beginning to start up the system, press the 
handle on the drive module to close it.
The drive module must be recognized as the system starts up so that you can install the 
server software on it.
7
Use Server Assistant on a remote computer to install the software on the drive module in 
your Xserve system. (See “Remote Installation” in Chapter 1 of Getting Started With 
Mac OS X Server for details.)
8
Unmount the volume on which you just installed the software.
9
Turn off the system by holding in the power button for 5 seconds.
Connecting Another Mac With the Xserve System in Target Disk Mode
You can also connect a PowerBook, iBook, Xserve, or other Mac directly to your Xserve 
system. The computer you connect must have a FireWire port and an optical drive, and the 
Xserve system must be in target disk mode.
Note:  The default name of the server’s startup volume is Server HD. If you connect another 
server to your Xserve system, you may want to change the name of its startup volume 
temporarily to avoid having two disks with that name when you want to install.
To put your system into target disk mode and connect a Mac to it:
1
Remove any FireWire devices that are connected to the Xserve system.
2
Use the front panel mode to put the system into target disk mode. See “Using Front Panel 
Mode on an Xserve System” on page 19 for instructions; use light 5.
3
Connect a PowerBook, iBook, or other Mac to the FireWire port on the system’s front panel.
4
Turn on the connected computer and insert the server install disc.
The Xserve system’s drive or volumes mount on the connected computer.
5
Begin the installation process from the server install disc and install on the mounted volume 
of your installation drive.
Note:  You can use either Server Assistant or the Terminal application and command-line 
tools to control the installation.
See Chapter 17, “Tools for Advanced Administrators,” in the Mac OS X Server 
Administrator’s Guide for more information about using command-line tools with the 
Terminal application.
19
Using Front Panel Mode on an Xserve System
Xserve systems with a slot-loading optical drive have a method of entering limited commands 
using the system identiﬁer button on the front panel. 
To use any of the available boot commands (listed after step 3):
1
With the power off, hold in the system identiﬁer button while you press the power button.
2
Continue holding in the system identiﬁer button until the top row of blue lights blinks 
sequentially and the rightmost light in the bottom row turns on.
3
Release the system identiﬁer button, then press it again to light the next button in the 
bottom row, moving from right to left. Press the button again to change lights.
The lights in the bottom row indicate (from right to left):
m Light 1 (far right):  Start up from the system disc (on models with an optical drive)
m Light 2:  Start up from a network server (NetBoot)
m Light 3:  Start up from the internal drive
m Light 4:  Bypass the current startup disk and start up from any other available startup disk
m Light 5:  Begin target disk mode (all volumes will show up)
m Light 6:  Restore the system’s default settings (reset NVRAM)
m Light 7:  Enter Open Firmware (via the serial port if no monitor and keyboard are 
connected)
4
When the light for the action you want is on, hold in the system identiﬁer button for at least 
2 seconds, until all lights in the top row are on.
5
Release the button.
Installing and Restoring from a Network Server
You can use a remote computer to install server software on one system or on many systems. 
Two methods that are especially useful for installations on multiple Xserve systems are 
Network Install and the Apple Software Restore (asr) command.
For more information about using command-line tools, see Chapter 17, “Tools for Advanced 
Administrators,” in the Mac OS X Server Administrator’s Guide. For details on starting up or 
installing over the network, see Chapter 12, “NetBoot,” and Chapter 13, “Network Install,” in 
the Mac OS X Server Administrator’s Guide.
