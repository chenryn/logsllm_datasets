country. While domestic peering is very common, our hypothesis is that inter-
national peering is still not a frequent occurrence in some countries. We begin
with the set of ASes that originate at least 0.05% of addresses in each country.
We remove marginal ASes that originate a very small fraction of the country’s
address space to reduce the scope of our active campaign, as we are limited
by RIPE Atlas’s system-wide limits on concurrent measurements [55]. This set
includes origin ASes that we classiﬁed as foreign to that country, but that orig-
inate BGP preﬁxes entirely geolocated in the country. (These ASes originate a
marginal fraction of the addresses in the vast majority of countries we study;
see Sect. 3.) We look for these origin ASes in CAIDA’s IXP dataset (from Oct.
2019 [21]), PeeringDB Colo dataset (from Mar. 1st, 2020 [9]), and inferred AS-
Relationships from BGP (Mar. 2020 [5]).
We classify an origin as a candidate if the following three conditions are true:
1. the origin AS has no foreign peers in BGP [5];
2. the origin AS is not a member of any IXPs or Colos based in another coun-
try [9,21]; and
3. the origin AS is not a member of any IXPs or Colos where any member AS
is based in a diﬀerent country than the origin AS [9,21].
The intuition for each test is as follows. If we observe at least one foreign peer
on BGP (1), this origin AS already has the ability to receive some external
content from that peer, bypassing transit providers. Therefore, transit providers
serving that origin will have fewer capabilities to observe traﬃc ﬂowing towards
it. Further, if an AS is a member of an IXP/Colo in another country (2), or a
member of an IXP/Colo where another member is from a diﬀerent country (3),
the origin AS is at least capable of establishing peering relationships with those
other ASes.
Figure 8a shows the percentage of a country’s address space originated by
candidate ASes. We select the top-100 countries as candidates for active mea-
surements. This set includes only countries where at least 25% of addresses are
originated by candidate ASes. Our motivation is to actively probe the set of
countries where it is most likely that transit providers still play an important
role on inbound international connectivity. These 100 countries are colored in
Fig. 8b.

6.2 Active Measurement Campaign
We ran a traceroute campaign to the 100 candidate countries for 14 days starting
May 2nd, 2020. Additionally, we use all publicly available IPv4 traceroutes on
RIPE Atlas during the same period—on the order of several million per hour—
in order to opportunistically take advantage of other measurements towards the
same ASes. We design our traceroute campaign guided by two constraints. First,
we want to select a geographically and topologically diverse set of probes. Second,
we have to operate within the rate limits of RIPE Atlas7, particularly regarding
concurrent measurements and credit expenditure.
Within these constraints, we launch ICMP traceroutes8 from 100 active—
shown as “connected” during the previous day [56]—RIPE Atlas probes (located
outside any target country) towards a single destination in each AS, twice daily9;
probing at this frequency gives us 28 opportunities to reach the AS during the
two-week period from each vantage point.
We target an IP in a single /24 block for each origin AS in each candidate
country by looking for any preﬁx originated by that AS that is entirely geolocated
or delegated within the candidate country (see Sect. 3). Our ﬁnal dataset is
comprised of 33,045,982 traceroutes, including those launched by other RIPE
users that meet our constraints. The distribution of the number of traceroutes
reaching each country has the following properties: (Min, 25th Pctl., Median,
Mean, 75th Pctl., Max) = (36, 13k, 46k, 330k, 250k, 3.3m). That is, the median
country received 46k traceroutes. Only three countries received fewer than a
thousand traceroutes: Eritrea (667), Nauru (154), and Tuvalu (36).
We use BdrmapIT [49] to translate our traceroutes into AS-level intercon-
nections. BdrmapIT requires a number of external datasets in its operation,
which we specify as follows: inferred AS-Level customer cone [48] from Mar.
2020; AS2Org, which infers groups of ASes who belong to the same organi-
zation10, from Jan. 2020; and datasets we mention in other sections—preﬁx-
to-Autonomous System mappings (Sect. 2), PeeringDB records (Sect. 6.1), and
RIR delegation records (Sect. 3). From these traceroutes and external datasets,
BdrmapIT infers a set of AS-level interconnections and the IP addresses (inter-
faces) at which they occur. Each interface inferred by BdrmapIT has an AS
“owner” assignment. We reconstruct the AS-level path observed on the tracer-
oute using such assignments.
6.3 Country-Level Transit Fraction
From the preceding sections we have built a set of AS-level paths taken from the
traceroute source to the destination AS. We now need a quantitative analysis

technique to infer the prevalence of transit links on inbound traces towards each
country.
To that end, we determine how frequently a transit (p2c) link is traversed
when crossing the AS-level national boundary11 towards an origin AS (ASo) in a
candidate country. We infer the AS-level national boundary as the link between
the last foreign AS observed on the AS-level path (starting from the vantage
point) and the subsequent AS.
We calculate how frequently, in the inbound traceroutes we process with
BdrmapIT, the AS-level national border crossing occurs on a transit link for
each origin AS. We scale this fraction to take into account the size of the address
space originated by each AS using the country-level transit fraction:
T (C) =
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
ASo,ASc∈dom(C)
ASt /∈dom(C)
R(ASo, ASt, ASc)
R(ASo)
· a∗(ASo, C)
A(C)
,
where R(ASo, ASt, ASc) is the number of traceroutes destined toward a preﬁx
originated by ASo that traverse a transit link between a foreign provider ASt
and a domestic customer ASc in country C; R(ASo) is the total number of
traceroutes where ASo is the last observed AS; and a∗(ASo, C)/A(C) is the
fraction of country C’s address space originated by ASo. For instance, if an AS
originates 50% of the country’s origin addresses, and 50% of the traces towards it
traverse a foreign transit provider AS, the contribution of that AS to the country-
level transit fraction becomes 0.25. Note that ASc and ASo are not necessarily
the same, as the border crossing may occur at the link between (direct and/or
indirect) providers of ASo.
The values of T (C) for each candidate country are represented in Fig. 8b:
countries in darker shades of blue have both a large probed and responsive
fraction and a large fraction of traceroutes from outside the country traversing
transit providers. The closer the fraction is to 1, the more evidence we have that
the country relies on transit providers for its international inbound connectivity.

6.4 Final Selection
Finally, in order to identify a set of primarily-transit countries, we evaluate the
values of T (C) across countries, shown in Fig. 9. At one extreme of Fig. 9 and
Fig. 8b are countries such as Ethiopia (ET) and Yemen (YE), T (C) = 0.95 and
0.7, respectively, where all available evidence points towards transit links as the
main inbound modality. At the other extreme are countries such as Syria (SY)
and Iran (IR), T (C) ≤ 0.01, where we rarely observe AS-level national borders
being crossed using transit links.
Outside the upper and lower extremes in Fig. 9, where the decision of whether
to include a country in our study is obvious, the middle results (most countries)
do not oﬀer clear dividing points. We decided then to set the threshold for T (C)
to classify a country as primarily-transit based on our validation with operators
(Sect. 7); in particular, we use the value of T (C) for Sudan (0.48) as a lower
bound, which is the lowest T (C) in any country that we were able to conﬁrm
relies on transit links for its inbound connectivity. The ﬁnal countries in our CTI
study are shown in a blue-white spectrum in Fig. 8c and as blue circles in Fig. 9,
75 of the 100 candidates. Countries in red are excluded from further analysis, as
at this time we lack suﬃcient evidence to support that they are primarily using
transit providers for inbound connectivity.
7 Stability and Validation
In this section, we discuss the ﬁndings of our stability analyses, validation with
operators, and a calculation of transit inﬂuence at the organization level.
7.1 Stability
Temporal Stability. We apply our CTI methodology to a set of BGP paths
from Feb. 2020 and Apr. 2020 and compare the results to those presented in
Sect. 5 (from Mar. 2020). Speciﬁcally, we compute the absolute value of the
diﬀerence in CTI across successive months for transit ASes listed in each country.
The results are shown in Table 2. We ﬁnd that the CTI values are relatively stable
across these months.

Stability to Changes in Geolocation Input. In order to assess the poten-
tial fragility of our study to inaccuracies in geolocation, we also applied our CTI

methodology using MaxMind [3] and computed the absolute value of the diﬀer-
ence in CTI scores produced with each location database. The output of this
analysis is (25th perc.,mean,median,75th perc.) = 0.00000, 0.00104, 0.00002,
0.00017, suggesting CTI is relatively stable across these geolocation inputs.
7.2 Operator Validation
We discussed our ﬁndings with employees or contractors of two types of organi-
zations: commercial network operators and non-proﬁts who conduct networking
research (universities, registrars, and non-commercial network operators). Addi-
tionally, we describe the results of our discussions follwing a mass email request
to ASes with preﬁxes geolocated in countries in our study. Discussions with all
of these organizations are anonymized. Our ﬁndings are largely consistent with
each operator’s view of the transit ecosystem of the countries discussed with
them.
The results of our discussion of CTI ﬁndings with 6 operators in 6 countries12
are shown in Table 3. Our CTI operator discussions consist of a conﬁrmation of
the AS set we identiﬁed as being most inﬂuential in their countries. Overall,
operators conﬁrm that the vast majority of ASes we identify are among the
most inﬂuential in their nations. We also summarize our discussions with: (i)
operators regarding our inferences of transit-dominant countries, (ii) ASes with
preﬁxes geolocated to these countries. Regarding (i) 10 operators in 9 countries13
conﬁrmed that their nations are primarily transit14.
Regarding (ii) we sent a mass email request to the WHOIS abuse address
registered by ASes that had preﬁxes geolocated in 10 countries15 (with IRB
approval): BO, CO, VE, CM, BD, GT, CL, HN, SV and ZW16. We received
111 responses in 9 of these countries (all but ZW). Of these, 107 conﬁrmed
they operate primarily in the country that we geolocated their preﬁxes to17.
Additionally, 108 were willing to discuss which type of business relationship
dominated their inbound international traﬃc: 83 stated that transit relationships
are the primary modality.
12 We sent a set of ASes produced before updating our CTI methodology to its current
form, which explains the “unconﬁrmed” column; the “top” ASes were deﬁned as the
country’s top 12, unless any of those ASes had a marginal CTI score.

AS Name]’s DNS nodes, but there are no foreign network operators present here.
Furthermore, until recently, only two ISPs held gateway licenses (i.e., were licensed
to provide external connectivity to Sudan).”
15 We only contacted ASes who had ≥ 1% of their addresses in the country. Since this
survey took place in 2021, we use the addresses geolocated in Jan. of that year.

7.3 Organization-Level Transit Inﬂuence
In some instances, multiple ASes may be operated by the same organization. We
identiﬁed 323 instances where multiple ASes belonging the same organization (as
of Jul. 2020 [20]) have CT I > 0 in a given country. We compute an upper bound
of the organization’s transit inﬂuence (in each country) by summing the CTI of
component ASes. We ﬁnd that 270 org-country pairs—an organization operating
in a country—have marginal inﬂuence, with the CTI sum under 0.05 (218 were
under 0.01).
