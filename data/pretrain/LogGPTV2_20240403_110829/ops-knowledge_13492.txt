User: Tornado is powerful webserver and web Framework written in Python, it can run by its own (stand-alone) or could also be run through an other webserver specially nginx
Is there any performance or advantage of runing Tornado through Nginx ?
Assistant: Tornado can be run on its own, but there are three major advantages to using nginx as a proxy in front of it:

Nginx is much more efficient at serving static files.
A proxy makes it easier to do rolling restarts of backend processes to perform upgrades without downtime.
Nginx can be configured to more efficiently reject abusive requests (DDoS, etc).
