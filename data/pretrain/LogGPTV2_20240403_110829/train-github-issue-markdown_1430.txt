I was looking into the classes for GetResponseEvent and PostResponseEvent and
found tthat even tought they share a lot of code they do not have common
acentors.
Here is what i found:
    GetResponseEvent -> KernelEvent -> Event
and
    PostResponseEvent -> Event
Get: implements `response property`  
KernelEvent: Implements `kernel`, `request` and `request type`  
Post: implements `kernel`, `request`, `response`
It seems to me that there is a clear overlap, would it make sense to organize
this so that both have a common ancestor and less duplicate code? Or is
PostResponseEvent not considered a `KernelEvent`?
