### Vue.js version
2.0.1
### Reproduction Link
I have written an example in jsfiddle  
https://jsfiddle.net/yreenchan/vfxtb7ps/1/
### Steps to reproduce
`var vm = new Vue({ el: '#app', data: { isShow: 0, second: 1 } });`
  1. :style="{opacity: isShow}", the default value of isShow is 0, and the dom is hidden;
  2. change the value of another property 'second'
### What is Expected?
Don't effect the :style renderer results when it's value is not changed.
### What is actually happening?
