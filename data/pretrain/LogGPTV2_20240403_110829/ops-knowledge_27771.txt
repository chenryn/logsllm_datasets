User: When trying to render a Django template file in Google App Engine

from google.appengine.ext.webapp import template
templatepath = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(file), 'template.html')
self.response.out.write (template.render( templatepath , template_values))

I come across the  following error:

<type
'exceptions.UnicodeDecodeError'>:
'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2
in position 17692: ordinal not in
range(128)
args = ('ascii', '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0
Str...07/a-beautiful-method-to-find-peace-of-mind/
--> ', 17692, 17693, 'ordinal not in range(128)')
encoding = 'ascii'
end = 17693
message = ''
object = '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0
Str...07/a-beautiful-method-to-find-peace-of-mind/
-->
reason = 'ordinal not in range(128)'
start = 17692

It seems that the underlying django template engine has assumed the "ascii" encoding, which should have been "utf-8".
Anyone who knows what might have caused the trouble and how to solve it?
Thanks.
Assistant: Did you check in your text editor that the template is encoded in utf-8?
