For reasons, I have a file called BUILD in my ios/ directory, which conflicts
with Xcode's default build output directory ('build/'), since macOS has case-
insensitive file system by default.
I can get around that by setting SYMROOT in project.pbxproj, but the flutter
tools still insist on using 'build/'. It would be nice if the build directory
was configurable with a command-line parameter, and the xcode_backend.sh
script passed $SYMROOT in there.
## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Create an empty (non-directory) file named 'build' in ios/
  2. flutter run //
