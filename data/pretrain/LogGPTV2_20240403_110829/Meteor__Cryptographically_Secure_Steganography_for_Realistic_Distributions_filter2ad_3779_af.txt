security, these constructions evaluate their work by measuring
the statistical difference between the output produced by the en-
coding scheme and real text. Highlighting the weaknesses of these
schemes, numerous attack papers have been published, e.g., [45–50].
These attacks use machine learning techniques to detect the pres-
ence of encoded messages generated with some of the works listed
previously. Ad-hoc and non-cryptographic security is insufficient
to provide security against powerful and determined adversaries,
especially nation-state adversaries.
Comparative Analysis. We assess Meteor against the following
previous solutions: (1) bins [37], (2) Huffman coding [41], and (3)
arithmetic coding [44]. We compare standard NLP language statis-
tics for these with a regular, random sample from the model, and
provide our results in Table 4. Note that we mark entropy as “N/A”
for Huffman and bins because these methods use a binning algo-
rithm which prevents us from calculating entropy meaningfully.
The random sample is a control distribution, and is not encoding
anything thereby having “N/A” capacity.
Of particular note in our results is the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence across algorithms, which in this case compares the
distribution of the model to the output distribution of the algo-
rithm. The KL-divergence for Meteor is very close to that of the
random sample, as Meteor merely changes the randomness to
steganographically-encoded randomness. As discussed previously,
algorithms that modify distributions from the model have high
biases, and this is reflected in the KL-divergence of Huffman and
bins being much higher than the rest. The arithmetic algorithm has
a lower KL-divergence than the rest of the NLP algorithms, as it
does not modify the distribution; however, it has a higher value
than Meteor because it reuses randomness, while Meteor uses fresh
randomness like the baseline random sample does.
We also note that the security properties of Meteor do not ham-
per the capacity metric significantly. Arithmetic output has a higher
capacity, but we note that the insecurity of this system makes this
additional capacity moot; modifying the parameters to Huffman
or bins could have yielded the same capacity with the same secu-
rity vulnerabilities. Table 4 also includes perplexity and entropy
statistics, that show Meteor is competitive in performance with the
insecure primitives proposed previously.
8 CONCLUSION
In this work we present an analysis of the practical limitations of
using cryptographically secure steganography on real, useful distri-
butions, identifying the need for samplers and impractical entropy
requirements as key impediments. We show that adapting existing
public key techniques is possible, but produces stegotext that are
extremely inefficient. We then present Meteor, a novel symmetric
key steganographic system that dramatically outperforms public
key techniques by fluidly adapting to changes in entropy. We eval-
uate Meteor, implementing it on GPU, CPU, and mobile, showing
that it is an important first step for universal, censorship-resistant
steganography. Finally, we compare Meteor to existing insecure
steganographic techniques from the NLP literature, showing it has
comparable performance while actually achieving cryptographic
security.
