Impact of Ambient Background Noise
6.7.4
In this section we investigate how ambient background noise im-
pacts the performance of our ﬁngerprinting technique. For this ex-
periment we consider scenarios where there is a crowd of people
using their smart devices and we are trying to ﬁngerprint those de-
vices by capturing audio signals (in this case ringtones) from the
surrounding environment. Table 16 highlights the four different
scenarios that we are considering. To emulate such environment,
external speakers (2 pieces) are placed between the smartphone and
microphone while recording is taking place. The external speak-
ers are constantly replaying the respective ambient noise in the
background. We consider a distance of two meters from the audio
source to recorder. The ambient background sounds were obtained
from PacDV [2] and SoundJay [16]. We also compute the signal-
to-noise (SNR) ratio between the original ringtone and the different
ambient background noises. The RMS (root-mean-square) value
of the different background noises varied from approximately 13%
(17.77 dB) to 18% (14.92 dB) of the RMS value of the ringtone un-
der consideration. Table 16 shows our ﬁndings (values are reported
as percentages). We can see that even in the presence of various
background noise we can achieve an F1-score of over 91%.

6.7.3 Varying Distance between Speaker and Recorder
Next, we inspect the impact of distance between the audio source
(i.e., smartphone) and recorder (i.e., laptop/PC) on ﬁngerprinting
precision. For this experiment we use a separate external micro-
phone as the signal capturing capacity of the microphone embed-
ded inside a laptop degrades drastically as distance increases. We
use the relatively inexpensive ($44.79) Audio-Technica ATR-6550
shotgun microphone for this experiment and vary the distance be-
tween the external microphone and smartphone from 0.1 meter to 5
meters. Table 15 summarizes the F1-scores obtained as the distance
between the smartphone and microphone varies. We see that as dis-
tance increases, F1-score decreases. This is expected, because the
longer the distance between the smartphone and microphone, the
harder it becomes to capture the minuscule deviations between au-
dio samples. However, we see that even up to two meters distance
we can achieve an F1-score of 93%. This suggests that our device
ﬁngerprinting approach works only up to a certain distance using
any commercial microphones. However, using specialized micro-
phones, such as parabolic microphones (usually used in capturing
7. DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
Our approach has a few limitations. First, we experimented with
52 devices manufactured by different vendors; it is possible that a
larger target device pool would lower accuracy. That said, distinc-
tions across different device types are more clear; additionally, au-
dio ﬁngerprints may be used in tandem with other techniques, like
accelerometer ﬁngerprinting [31], to better discriminate between
devices. Secondly, most of the experiments took place in a lab set-
ting. However, we studied the impact of ambient background noise
and still found our approach to be applicable. Lastly, all the phones
used in our experiments were not in mint condition and some of the
idiosyncrasies of individual microphones and speakers may have
been the result of uneven wear and tear on each device; we believe,
however, that this is likely to occur in the real world as well.
8. CONCLUSION
In this paper we show that it is feasible to ﬁngerprint smart de-
vices through on-board acoustic components like microphones and

dard components present in almost all smart devices available to-
day, this creates a key privacy concern for users. To demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach, we collect ﬁngerprints from 52 differ-
ent smartphones covering a total of ﬁve different brands of smart-
phones. Our studies show that it is possible to successfully ﬁn-
gerprint smartphones through microphones and speakers, not only
under controlled environments, but also in the presence of ambi-
ent noise. We believe our ﬁndings are important steps towards un-
derstanding the full consequences of ﬁngerprinting smart devices
through acoustic channels.
