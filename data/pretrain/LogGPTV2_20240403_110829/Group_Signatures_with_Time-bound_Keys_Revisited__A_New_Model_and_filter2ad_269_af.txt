Figure 4: The Running Time of the Verify Algorithm
(Rall = 5, 000, 000)
Since the revocation check requires O(Rpre)-times pairing
computations4, the running time of the Verify algorithm
linearly depends on Rpre. Nevertheless, as a reasonable as-
sumption, the natural revocation accounts for most of signer
revocations in practice and prematurely revoked signers are
only a small fraction. Thus, for a relatively small Rate, our
scheme is still eﬃcient in practice.
4In the previous schemes [20, 37], no pairing computation
is required for the revocation check (just O(Rpre)-times ex-
ponentiations are required). Thus, our revocation check is
ineﬃcient than those of the previous schemes due to the
pairing computations. However, at the expense of this inef-
ﬁciency, our scheme provides backward unlinkability.

algorithm for each Rate and Rall in Fig 5.

6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we revisit the deﬁnition of GS-TBK given
in [20, 37], and give a new security model that considers
unforgeability of expiry time of signing keys. Moreover,
the computational cost of our signing algorithm is constant
whereas those of the previous schemes depend on the bit-
length of the time representation. We also give implemen-
tations.
Our GS-TBK scheme and previous schemes are secure in
the random oracle model. Since we employ the Ohara et
al. revocable group signature scheme which implements the
Libert-Peters-Yung revocable group signature scheme [33]
in the random oracle model, we might be able to employ
the Libert-Peters-Yung revocable group signature scheme
for implementing time-bound keys. Moreover, as mentioned
by Libert and Vergnaud [35], the Nakanishi-Funabiki revoca-
tion technique [42] itself does not depend on random oracles.
Thus, a GS-TBK scheme in the standard model might be
constructed by employing the Libert-Peters-Yung and the
Nakanishi-Funabiki schemes. Though it is theoretically in-
terest, on the other hand, there is room for argument on
the eﬃciency of the scheme. Since a signature of the Libert-
Peters-Yung scheme contains about 100 group elements, it
seems diﬃcult to achieve a practical eﬃciency. Hence, we
pursue a practical eﬃciency in this paper, and leave the
standard model construction as a future work.
In addition to the standard model construction, remov-
ing pairing computations from the revocation check, e.g.,
employing [15], is an interesting future work of this paper.
