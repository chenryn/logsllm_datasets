## Introduction to Smart Guns
- **Definition:** A smart gun is a firearm that can only be fired by an authorized user.
- **Authorization Techniques:**
  - Magnetic rings
  - RFID
  - Biometrics (e.g., fingerprint readers)

## Motivation
- **Why I Care:** The Armatix iP1, featured in the James Bond film "Skyfall," sparked my interest in smart gun security.
- **Motivation:** Challenging and improving the security of these devices.

## Armatix iP1 Overview
- **Design:**
  - Custom semi-automatic pistol
  - Fires .22 LR cartridges
  - Hammer-fired
  - Introduced around 2015
- **Authorization:**
  - Paired wristwatch
  - Watch must be within 25 cm of the pistol
- **Communication:**
  - 5.35 kHz inductive coupling (Pistol to Watch)
  - 916.5 MHz RF (Watch to Pistol)

## Normal Operation
1. Enter PIN on the watch.
2. Wear the watch within 25 cm of the pistol.
3. Squeeze the grip on the pistol.
4. Fire the pistol.

## Security Vulnerabilities and Exploits
### Defeat Proximity Restriction
- **Method:**
  - Relay 5.35 kHz burst using custom hardware.
  - First device listens for 5.35 kHz chirp and sends indication over backhaul.
  - Second device generates 5.35 kHz chirp near the watch.
- **Results:**
  - Works reliably up to 3 meters (12x range improvement).
  - Latency of 630 us added by the relay.

### Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Scenarios:**
  - Adversary prevents the gun from being fired by an authorized user.
  - Parent uses a backup kill-switch if the gun is not locked up properly.
  - Unintentional interference from other devices (e.g., baby monitors, wireless microphones).
- **RF Weaknesses:**
  - 916.5 MHz ISM band used by many products.
  - OOK modulation is highly susceptible to interference.
- **Defenses:**
  - Use more transmitter power.
  - Use error-correcting codes.
  - Use more-robust modulation.

### Fire Without Authorization
- **Mechanical Attack:**
  - Use strong neodymium magnets (N52) to bypass the electromagnet.
  - Magnets pull the ferrous material, unblocking the firing pin.
- **Results:**
  - Successful firing without the watch or batteries.
  - Caveats: Magnet can prevent trigger reset and cause light primer strikes.

## Technical Details
### Communication Protocols
- **Unlock Sequence:**
  - Pistol sends 5.35 kHz CW chirp for 1.5 ms.
  - Watch receives chirp and sends unlock response on 916.5 MHz.
  - Pistol ACKs 100 ms later on 916.5 MHz.
- **Data Transmission:**
  - OOK, Manchester coding.
  - 30 kbit/s raw, 2 kbytes/s net.
  - 8-bit checksum.
  - 19-byte frame from watch to pistol.
  - 13-byte frame from pistol to watch.

### Hardware and Cost
- **Relay Devices:**
  - Total cost: $20
  - Components:
    - $5 nRF24 module
    - $2 PCB
    - $1 microcontroller
    - $2 other parts
- **Custom Test Transmitter:**
  - 916.5 MHz transmitter (Murata TR1000)
  - Antenna (Linx ANT-916-SP)
  - Microcontroller (PIC16F18313)
  - Stripboard breadboard
  - Total cost: $5 to $20

## Legal and Ethical Considerations
- **New Jersey Smart Gun Law:**
  - Takes effect 3 years after qualifying guns are available at retail.
  - Only one model currently for sale in the US (Armatix iP1).
  - Owners of gun stores have received threats over plans to sell the Armatix iP1.

## Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts:**
  - The security of smart guns is a critical issue.
  - Continuous testing and improvement are necessary to ensure safety and reliability.

## Backup Slides
- **Smart Gun Models:**
  - iGun shotgun (RFID ring)
  - Kloepfer pistol (fingerprint)
  - Magna-Trigger/Magloc retrofit (magnets)
  - Safe Gun retrofit (fingerprint)
- **Tools for Reverse Engineering:**
  - Patents
  - FCC certification database
  - Government resources
