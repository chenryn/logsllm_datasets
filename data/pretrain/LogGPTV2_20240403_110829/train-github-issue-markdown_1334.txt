##### SUMMARY
I have writen more than 50 Ansible roles, with the aim of installing/updating
my home-server. It works nice.  
But running the whole book takes _**very**_ long! One reason it takes so long
is that some roles that I include using `include_role` get often repeated
needlessly (no change) at places where I do not expect them to run.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
I tried to minimally reproduce the problem, and I came up with this:  
https://yalis.fr/git/yves/ansible-repeated-tasks-showcase
In short:
  * `nfs` and `postgresql` both depend on `cleanupdate`, which depends on `init`
  * each of these may have “upstream” actions and “local” actions
  * the “upstream” actions are enclosed between: 
    * an `include_role` of `etckeeper.inc` with tasks from `upstream.yml`
    * an `include_role` of `etckeeper.inc` with tasks from `merge.yml`
  * the “local” actions are followed by: 
    * an `include_role` of `etckeeper.inc` with tasks from `local.yml`
  * furthermore, `init` starts with: 
    * an `include_role` of `etckeeper.inc` with tasks from `init.yml`
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I expect the following sequence of actions:
  1. load role `nfs` and see its `meta/` dependencies, for instance `cleanupdate`
  2. load role `cleanupdate` and see its `meta/` dependencies, for instance `init`
  3. load role `init` and see its `meta/` dependencies, for instance none
  4. run `init`, then `cleanupdate`, then `nfs`
  5. load role `postgresql` and see its `meta/` dependencies, for instance `cleanupdate`
  6. `cleanupdate` has already ran, so skip it
  7. run `postgresql`
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Instead of the 6th step, I see a bunch of runs of tasks from `etckeeper.inc`,
which is exactly what I see with my big, real, Ansible setup. And this is only
a minimal example with 2 roles and simplified meta-dependencies…
The actual, annotated, output of `ansible-playbook -i production site.yml` can
