Question: When reviewing a peer's code, you notice several functions with deep nesting levels. Your peer argues that flat structures can be more confusing and less expressive in certain contexts. Which of the following points could be a valid counterargument supporting the use of deep nesting in some scenarios?
"A": "Deep nesting can make the code more readable by clearly separating logical blocks that depend on different conditions.",
"B": "Flat structures prevent the use of control structures such as loops and conditional statements, which are essential for any non-trivial program.",
"C": "Excessive use of deep nesting is always detrimental, and all logic should be expressed in a linear fashion without any nesting for maximum clarity.",
"D": "Deep nesting is a poor practice because it invariably leads to code that is difficult to test and debug."
Answer: A
