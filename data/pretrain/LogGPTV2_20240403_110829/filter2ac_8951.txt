### Title: Detecting Domain Abuse for Phishing Using DNS: A Case Study from the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration

The Dutch Tax and Customs Administration, as a high-profile public-sector organization, frequently encounters criminals who impersonate its representatives to send phishing emails to the public. To combat this, we have developed a technique that leverages DNS logging and RFCs, such as RFC7208 (Sender Policy Framework, or SPF), to identify and mitigate these phishing attacks. This method is universally applicable and provides valuable insights into the origins and targets of phishing emails.

In this presentation, we will begin by outlining the available standards and protocols designed to enhance email security. We will provide an overview of key protocols including:
- **STARTTLS**: Encrypts email traffic between mail servers.
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: Validates the sender's IP address against a list of authorized IP addresses.
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Ensures the integrity and authenticity of email messages.
- **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)**: Aligns SPF and DKIM policies and provides reporting on email authentication.
- **DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities)**: Uses DNSSEC to secure TLS connections.
- **MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security)**: Enforces secure SMTP connections.

We will also delve into advanced SPF options and how they can be utilized to strengthen domain protection. By integrating these protocols, our framework offers a comprehensive solution to detect and prevent the misuse of your organization's domains for phishing attacks. 

Our goal is to share these techniques widely, as we believe their widespread adoption could significantly reduce the prevalence of phishing emails. Join us to learn how you can better protect your organization and its stakeholders from these threats.
