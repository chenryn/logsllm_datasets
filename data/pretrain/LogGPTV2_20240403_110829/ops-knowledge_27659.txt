Question: "Alice needs to securely send a message to Bob without having previously established a shared secret key. They decide to use public-key cryptography. Which of the following steps should Alice and Bob take to ensure secure communication? (Select all that apply)"
 "A": "Alice encrypts her message with her own private key and sends it to Bob, who then uses Alice's public key to decrypt the message."
 "B": "Alice generates a secret key for a symmetric-key cryptosystem, encrypts it with Bobâ€™s public key, and sends him the ciphertext."
 "C": "Bob publishes a public key that Alice uses to encrypt her message before sending. Bob then decrypts the message using his private key."
 "D": "Bob sends Alice his private key so that she can encrypt messages with it, and Bob uses his public key to decrypt received messages."
Answer: BC
