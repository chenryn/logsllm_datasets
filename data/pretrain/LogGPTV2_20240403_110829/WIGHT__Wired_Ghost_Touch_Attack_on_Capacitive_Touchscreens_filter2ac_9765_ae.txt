## 4. WIGHT Attack Mechanisms

### 4.1 Injection Attacks
Injection attacks can perform injection to tap the button and connect AirPods, which can be used as a stepping stone to activate and control the voice assistant by double-tapping the AirPods [65].

### 4.2 Alteration Attacks
By performing alteration attacks, the attacker can misdirect the victim user’s touchpoint to ghost touches on the same RX electrode. For example, when the attacker sends a link that contains malicious files, two buttons will appear at the bottom of the screen, prompting users to click a button to open the link or not. If the user clicks the “Decline” button, the fast-moving ghost touches along the RX can tap the “Accept” button with a success rate of around 50%. Clicking a malicious link may enable a virus [66] and damage the user’s privacy. The attacker may also connect malicious NFC tags in a similar way [67].

### 4.3 Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
A DoS attack can disable touch services and block the victim user’s touch operations. We envision that an attacker can combine injection attacks and DoS attacks. For example, if the user finds his/her phone is performing an unintended operation caused by injection attacks, e.g., loading malware, he/she cannot interrupt the process in the presence of DoS attacks. DoS attacks can also be used to intentionally degrade the user experience, e.g., causing interruptions while the user is playing a delay-sensitive game.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Safety Recommendations
In practice, a user may physically touch the victim device while an attacker is injecting attack signals into the charging cable. Considering that the attack signal is an alternating current with a high voltage, we seriously recommend that researchers should conduct experiments under the supervision of safety professionals, and the laboratory needs to be equipped with standard electrical protective devices, e.g., the earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) [68], to prevent electric shock and potential injury to humans.

### 5.2 Potential Countermeasures
#### 5.2.1 Hardware-based Suppression
WIGHT attack relies on the mechanism that a CM interference of high intensity can be converted into a DM interference in asymmetric circuits. Therefore, we propose a hardware defense named Ghost Blocker that can suppress or even prevent the attack signal’s transmission. The key component is a CM choke that can create an opposing field of magnetic flux to suppress the CM noises traveling in the same direction on a group of lines [69]. We design the CM choke’s inductor with an inductance \( L_{cm} = \frac{X_L}{2f\pi} \), where \( X_L \) is the resistance of the load, and \( f \) is the frequency of the touchscreen’s excitation signal (around 100 kHz to 500 kHz). Therefore, to maximize the suppression effect, the inductance in practice needs to be around 0.77\( X_L \) to 1.59\( X_L \) μH. To verify the effectiveness, we simulate two identical asymmetric circuits in Fig. 20. The bottom circuit is equipped with a CM choke while the top circuit is unprotected. The results displayed in the voltmeter show that the CM choke can effectively suppress the CM interference, therefore eliminating DM interference that causes ghost touches.

#### 5.2.2 Software-based Detection
We propose a software-based detection method that exploits capacitance variation and touch features such as pressure, touch size, etc., to differentiate human touches and ghost touches. The defender first collects touch data of humans and ghost touches using touchscreens and additional pressure sensors [54], [55], [70]. The dataset can be given as \( D = [d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5] \), where \( d_1 \) is the capacitance variation, \( d_2 \) is the number of simultaneous touches, \( d_3 \) is the touch duration, \( d_4 \) is the touch size, and \( d_5 \) is the touch pressure. Based on the collected dataset, the defender can train a classifier, which we envision can effectively detect the attacks because ghost touches are very different from human touches on these features.

#### 5.2.3 Authentication
We suggest building a collaborative database of trustworthy public charging stations. The defender may exploit hardware fingerprinting methods [71] with the authentication chips in touchscreen devices to verify secure charging stations. If an authorized charging station is hijacked by an attacker, its hardware fingerprints will become invalid, and the authentication chip can alert the user.

## 6. Related Work

### 6.1 Touchscreen Attacks
Research in recent years has shown that an attacker can manipulate a device by attacking its touchscreen. Shwartz et al. [72] first presented a touch injection attack by replacing the touchscreen driver. This attack can accurately inject any touchpoint into a victim device. Nevertheless, a practical challenge is that the attacker needs to tamper with the victim device’s hardware in advance. In comparison, other studies focused on attacking the touch sensing circuits using physical signals. Maruyama et al. [7] proposed Tap’n Ghost, an alteration attack that can change the detected touch position when a user is touching the screen. This attack is achieved by generating an electric field that interferes with the RX electrodes of touchscreens. Wang et al. [8] presented GhostTouch, an injection attack that can inject ghost touches into targeted positions of the screen by emitting an electromagnetic interference (EMI). Both of the attacks require the victim device to be placed on a table where the attack device is hidden underneath. In this work, we present WIGHT, the first wired attack on capacitive touchscreens that can achieve injection, alteration, and DoS outcomes via the charging cable and even across power adapters.

### 6.2 Charging-based and USB-based Attacks
Universal Serial Bus (USB) has become the de-facto standard for both charging and data transfer on modern devices [73]. Many vulnerabilities have been found in the USB interface. For example, several studies have demonstrated that sensitive information, including passwords to unlock smartphones [74], critical keys in cryptographic systems [75], information of the browsed webpage [76], display content of a screen [35], data traffic [77], etc., can be extracted through USB power cables. Esteves et al. [78] demonstrated that EMI signals conducted through charging ports could be used to inject voice commands into smartphones. Due to the trust-by-default nature of the USB ecosystem [34], malicious USB peripherals have emerged in recent years. Some USB peripherals can be used to eavesdrop on signals, such as BadUSB Hubs [36], KeyGrabber [79], and CottonMouth [80], and others can be used to inject signals, such as USBee [81], USB Killer [82], and TURNIPSCHOOL [83]. Different from these USB-based attacks, our attack does not rely on the data lines and therefore cannot be defended using the traditional data blocking techniques [37].

## 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we present WIGHT, the first wired attack on capacitive touchscreens via charging cables. WIGHT can inject ghost touches regardless of whether the screen is being touched or not and can disable the touch service of victim devices. We analyze the underlying principle of ghost touches theoretically and experimentally and find that due to the asymmetric circuits, a common-mode noise on the power line can be converted into a differential-mode noise that interferes with the capacitance measurement. We have validated the effectiveness of WIGHT on 9 commercial touchscreen devices, 13 charging cables, and 6 power adapters and proposed both hardware and software countermeasures to mitigate the threat.
