can perform injection attacks to tap the button and connect the
AirPods, which can be used as a stepping stone to activate and
control the voice assistant by double-tapping the AirPods [65].
2) Misdirecting Options: By performing alteration attacks,
the attacker can misdirect the victim user’s touchpoint to ghost
touches on the same RX electrode. For example, when the
attacker sends a link that contains malicious ﬁles, two buttons
will appear at the bottom of the screen, prompting users to
click a button to open the link or not. If the user clicks the
“Decline” button, the fast-moving ghost touches along the RX
can tap the “Accept” button with a success rate of around 50%.
Clicking a malicious link may enable a virus [66] and damage
the user’s privacy. The attacker may also connect malicious
NFC tags in a similar way [67].
Limited by the driving method of the victim touchscreen,
WIGHT attack cannot control ghost touches to appear at any
position of the screen. For example, injection attacks may at
most inject ghost touches along any TX electrode or at ﬁxed
areas/positions, and alteration attacks can only cause ghost
touches along the RX electrode that the user touches. There-
fore, in most cases, the ghost touches may appear randomly
on a vertical or horizontal line of the screen. If two buttons
are aligned horizontally on the electrode where ghost touches
appear, the success rate of taping a speciﬁc button will be
around 50%. We envision that future work could investigate
the feasibility of more ﬁne-grained control of ghost touches.

VII. DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the safety recommendations,
limitations, and potential countermeasures of WIGHT attack.
A. Safety Recommendations
the attack signal
In practice, a user may physically touch the victim device
while an attacker is injecting attack signals into the charging
cable. Considering that
is an alternating
current with a high voltage, we seriously recommend that
researchers should conduct experiments under the supervi-
sion of safety professionals, and the laboratory needs to be
equipped with standard electrical protective devices, e.g., the
earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) [68], to prevent electric
shock and potential injury to humans.
C. Potential Countermeasures
WIGHT attack manipulates devices by injecting ghost
touches into the touchscreens via the charging cable. There-
fore, it is difﬁcult to defend against this attack using traditional
methods such as data blockers [34], [36], [37]. To mitigate
the threat, we propose potential countermeasures from three
perspectives: hardware-based suppression, software-based de-
tection, and authentication.
1) Hardware-based Suppression: WIGHT attack relies on
the mechanism that a CM interference of high intensity can
be converted into a DM interference in asymmetric circuits.
Therefore, we propose a hardware defense named Ghost
Blocker that can suppress or even prevent the attack signal’s
transmission. The key component is a CM choke that can
create an opposing ﬁeld of magnetic ﬂux to suppress the
CM noises traveling in the same direction on a group of
lines [69]. We design the CM choke’s inductor with an
inductance Lcm = XL/(2f π), where XL is the resistance of
the load, and f is the frequency of the touchscreen’s excitation
signal (around 100 kHz to 500 kHz). Therefore, to maximize
the suppression effect, the inductance in practice needs to be
around 0.77XL to 1.59XL μH. To verify the effectiveness,
we simulate two identical asymmetric circuits in Fig. 20. The

show that the CM choke can effectively suppress the CM
interference, therefore eliminating DM interference that causes
ghost touches.
touch size, etc.,
2) Software-based Detection: We propose a software-based
detection method that exploits capacitance variation and touch
features such as pressure,
to differentiate
human touches and ghost touches. The defender ﬁrst collects
touch data of humans and ghost touches using touchscreens
and additional pressure sensors [54], [55], [70]. The dataset
can be given as D = [d1, d2, d3, d4, d5], where d1 is the capac-
itance variation, d2 is the number of simultaneous touches, d3
is the touch duration, d4 is the touch size, and d5 is the touch
pressure. Based on the collected dataset, the defender can
train a classiﬁer, which we envision can effectively detect the
attacks because ghost touches are very different from human
touches on these features.
3) Authentication: We suggest building a collaborative
database of trustworthy public charging stations. The defender
may exploit hardware ﬁngerprinting methods [71] with the
authentication chips in touchscreen devices to verify secure
charging stations. If an authorized charging station is hijacked
by an attacker, its hardware ﬁngerprints will become invalid
and the authentication chip can alert the user.
VIII. RELATED WORK
We summarize the related work on touchscreen attacks as
well as charging-based and USB-based attacks.
A. Touchscreen Attacks
Research in recent years has shown that an attacker can
manipulate a device by attacking its touchscreen. Shwartz et
al. [72] ﬁrst presented a touch injection attack by replacing the
touchscreen driver. This attack can accurately inject any touch-
point into a victim device. Nevertheless, a practical challenge
is that the attacker needs to tamper with the victim device’s
hardware in advance. In comparison, other studies focused
on attacking the touch sensing circuits using physical signals.
Maruyama et al. [7] proposed Tap’n Ghost, an alteration attack
that can change the detected touch position when a user is
touching the screen. This attack is achieved by generating an
electric ﬁeld that interferes with the RX electrodes of touch-
screens. Wang et al. [8] presented GhostTouch, an injection
attack that can inject ghost touches into targeted positions of
the screen by emitting an electromagnetic interference (EMI).
Both of the attacks require the victim device to be placed
on a table where the attack device is hidden underneath.
In this work, we present WIGHT, the ﬁrst wired attack on
capacitive touchscreens that can achieve injection, alteration,
and DoS outcomes via the charging cable and even across
power adapters.
B. Charging-based and USB-based Attacks
Universal Serial Bus (USB) has become the de-facto stan-
dard for both charging and data transfer on modern de-
vices [73]. Many vulnerabilities have been found in the USB
interface. For example, several studies have demonstrated that
sensitive information including passwords to unlock smart-
phones [74], critical keys in cryptographic systems [75],
information of the browsed webpage [76], display content
of a screen [35], data trafﬁc [77] etc., can be extracted
through USB power cables. Esteves et al. [78] demonstrated
that EMI signals conducted through charging ports could be
used to inject voice commands into smartphones. Due to the
trust-by-default nature of the USB ecosystem [34], malicious
USB peripherals have emerged in recent years. Some USB
peripherals can be used to eavesdrop on signals, such as
BadUSB Hubs [36], KeyGrabber [79], and CottonMouth [80],
and others can be used to inject signals, such as USBee [81],
USB Killer [82], and TURNIPSCHOOL [83]. Different from
these USB-based attacks, our attack does not rely on the data
lines and therefore cannot be defended using the traditional
data blocking techniques [37].
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present WIGHT, the ﬁrst wired attack
on capacitive touchscreens via charging cables. WIGHT can
inject ghost touches regardless of whether the screen is being
touched or not and can disable the touch service of victim
devices. We analyze the underlying principle of ghost touches
theoretically and experimentally and ﬁnd that due to the
asymmetric circuits, a common-mode noise on the power line
can be converted into a differential-mode noise that interferes
with the capacitance measurement. We have validated the
effectiveness of WIGHT on 9 commercial touchscreen devices,
13 charging cables, and 6 power adapters and proposed both
hardware and software countermeasures to mitigate the threat.
