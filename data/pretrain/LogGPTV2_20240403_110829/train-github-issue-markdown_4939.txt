## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Run the following app: https://gist.github.com/tvolkert/1458377c6d4bfb582e14bb284083c1b2
  2. In the drawer, select "Show Breakage" to set the `Material.debugEnablePhysicalModel` value to `true`.
  3. Look closely at the text rendering within the tab contents
## Results
The rendering of the contents of the tab seem to have pixel rounding errors.
See the screenshots without raster cache checkerboard and with raster cache
checkerboard.
## Analysis
When you select "Checkerboard Raster Cache Images" in the drawer, the fact
that the checkerboard patterns show artifacts as well indicates that this is a
raster cache issue -- and that the `Material.debugEnablePhysicalModel` flag is
merely tickling a code path into causing the raster cache to show this
underlying issue.
