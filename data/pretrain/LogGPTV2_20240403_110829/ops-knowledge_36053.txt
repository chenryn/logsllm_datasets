Question: Consider a web application built using a framework that allows automatic binding of user input to model objects. A developer has created the following controller to handle new user sign-ups in a Java web application:

java
@RequestMapping(value = "/signup", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String signUp(User newUser) {
    userRepository.save(newUser);
    return "success";
}


The associated `User` model is as follows:

java
public class User {
   private String name;
   private String email;
   private boolean isVerified;
   // Getters and Setters
}


Which of the following HTTP POST requests could potentially exploit a Mass Assignment vulnerability, assuming no additional security measures are in place?
"A": "POST /signup name=alice&email=alice@example.com",
"B": "POST /signup name=alice&email=alice@example.com&isVerified=true",
"C": "POST /signup name=alice&email=alice@example.com&isAdmin=true",
"D": "POST /signup name=alice&email=alice@example.com&accountBalance=100000"
Answer: C
