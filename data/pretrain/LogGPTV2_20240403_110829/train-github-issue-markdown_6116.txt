HTML5 supports a variety of new form field input types such as "email," "tel,"
and "date" (to name a few). e.g.  In all known cases,
browsers that don't understand these new field types gracefully degrade to
type "text." Since these new field types permit modern browsers (especially
mobile browsers) to handle certain fields in a special manner (e.g. bring up
different variant of on-screen keyboard conducive to the type of field being
edited) and because they degrade gracefully, they're quickly becoming popular
to use, but unfortunately, Spring MVC's form-binding tags don't currently
permit use of these new field types. i.e. there is no form:email or form:tel
tag. It seems it would be rather simple to include these by extending
org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.form.InputTag to change the field type,
in much the same way that
org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.form.PasswordInputTag already does.
