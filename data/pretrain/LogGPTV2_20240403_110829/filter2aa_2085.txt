# Building Spectacular Christmas Light Shows with Computer-Controlled Lights

## Basic Elements of a Light Show

- **LEDs**
- **Power Supplies**
- **Waterproof Cases**
- **Cabling**
- **Pixel Controllers**
- **Sequencing Software**
- **Show Controller + Software**
- **FM Transmitter**
- **Zip Ties** (Lots and lots of zip ties)

### Traditional Mini-Lights vs. LEDs
- **LEDs Used Here:**
  - **3 LEDs on 1 Chip**: Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) LEDs combine to create a wide range of colors through additive color mixing.
  - **"Smart" RGB LEDs**: These are the core of the display, using the WS-2812b serial protocol, which is simple and allows for indefinite length strings. Each pixel reshapes the signal, making it robust.

## Customizing Your Display

### LED Form Factors
- **Customize by Cutting and Soldering**: LEDs come in various form factors, allowing for customization. You can cut and solder them to fit your specific needs.

### Custom Elements

#### Mega Trees
- **Matrix Made of Pixel Strings**: These trees can display pictures, animations, and effects.
- **Low Resolution**: For example, a 50x32 pixel tree that is 14 feet tall.
- **Dominates the Scenery**: A key focal point of the light show.

#### Flood Lights
- **Rounding Out the Display**: Flood lights provide a "color wash" effect on walls and trees.
- **Power Range**: 10-30 Watts.
- **Control Protocols**:
  - **Streaming-ACN (E.131)**: An industry-standard suite of protocols for lighting and control via Ethernet.
  - **sACN (E1.31)**: A subset for "lightweight" devices, using UDP for unicast or multicast communication.
  - **Universes**: Groups up to 512 channels.

### Ethernet Control of Pixels
- **Ethernet to Pixels**: This method involves power and fusing, remapping, and testing pixels.
- **Web-Based Interfaces**: Good controllers offer web-based interfaces for easy management.

## Running the Show

### Controller
- **Dedicated Computer**: Manages the light show, starting lights on schedule and streaming data to controllers.
- **Popular Options**:
  - **Windows PC**
  - **FPP Falcon Player (Raspberry Pi)**

### Sequencing
- **Alignment to Music**: Light show events are synchronized with music.
- **Millisecond Control**: Precise control over lights to apply effects across one or more elements.
- **Complex Visual Patterns**: Computing and simulating the show without hardware.
- **Adaptable Sequences**: Free and commercial sequences can be adapted to fit your needs.

### Raspberry Pi as a Pixel Driver
- **Software Library**: Generates pixel serial data.
- **GPIO Pin 18**: Direct drive with 3.3V data output (suboptimal for 5V WS-2811/2812 pixels).
- **Buffered Outputs**: Better performance with 12V and 5V pixel options.
- **Multiple Strings**: Supports two strings of 800+ pixels.
- **Real-Time Clock**: Bonus feature for precise timing.

## Purchasing and Setup

### Buying Pixels
- **Sources**:
  - **Direct from China**
  - **Pre-sales and Group Buys**
  - **eBay and Amazon**
  - **Specialty Sellers**
- **Considerations**:
  - **Form Factor**
  - **Voltage (5V/12V)**

### Matrix Displays
- **P10 Panels (10MM Pixels)**:
  - **Beaglebone Adapter**: Up to 64 P10 panels.
  - **Raspberry Pi Adapter**: Up to 12 P10 panels.
- **Software**: FPP Falcon Player.
- **Video Example**: [Link to Matrix Display Video]

## Weatherproofing

- **Weather-Rated Lights**: Essential for outdoor use.
- **Clear Silicone Caulk**: To seal strip ends.
- **Weatherproof Connectors**: Ensure connections are secure.
- **Electrical Enclosures**:
  - **CG-2000 Cable Boxes**
  - **Tackle Boxes**
  - **Ammo Cans**
- **Cooling**: Can become an issue; proper ventilation is necessary.

### Voltage and Signal Challenges
- **Voltage Drop**: Can cause white colors to shade to pink.
  - **Solution**: Voltage injection at both ends of the string.
- **Signal Corruption**:
  - **Solution**: Use a "null pixel" to reshape the signal.

## Broadcasting

- **Audio Output**: The controller outputs audio to an FM radio station for viewers.
- **Finding an Open Channel**: Use resources like [Radio-Locator](https://radio-locator.com/) to avoid interference.
- **Antenna Quality**: Makes a significant difference in signal clarity.
- **FCC Compliance**: Ensure the signal is clear and within FCC rules.

## Required Skills

- **Soldering**
- **Debugging**
- **Planning**
- **Logical Thinking**
- **Creative and Artistic Design**
- **Attention to Detail**
