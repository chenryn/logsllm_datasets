Building Absurd 
Christmas Light Shows
Computer Controlled Lights
Basic Elements of a Light Show
• LEDs
• Power Supplies
• Waterproof cases
• Cabling
• Pixel Controllers
• Sequencing Software
• Show Controller + Software
• FM Transmitter
+Zip Ties…. 
Lots and lots of zip ties
Traditional Mini-Lights
LEDs used here
• 3 LEDS on 1 chip
Creating Colors
Red, Green, Blue LEDS combine to make colors
Additive Color
Additive Colors
“Smart” RGB at the core 
of the display
What makes them smart?
Pixels: WS-2812b serial protocol
• Simple protocol
• Indefinite length strings*
• Reshapes pulses at each pixel
Many form factors for LEDs
Customize: cut and solder
Custom Elements
Mega Trees
• Matrix made of Pixel Strings
• Pictures, Animations, Effects
• Low resolution
• Example: 50x32 pixels, 14 feet tall
• Dominate the scenery
Mega Tree
Flood Lights
• Round out the display
• 10-30 Watts
• “Color Wash” Walls & Trees
• Streaming-ACN (E.131) Protocol
• ACN- Industry standard suite of protocols for 
lighting and control via Ethernet
• Subset for "lightweight" devices called sACN (E1.31)
• UDP: Unicast to a single IP or Multicast
• Groups up to 512 channels in “Universes”
Ethernet Control of Pixels
• Ethernet to pixels
• Power and Fusing 
• Remapping
• Testing Pixels
• Good controllers have 
web based interfaces
Controller
Running the show
• Dedicated computer
• Starts lights on schedule
• Streams data to controllers
• Two popular options:
• Windows PC
• FPP Falcon Player- Raspberry PI
Sequencing
• Light show events aligned to music
• Millisecond control of lights
• Apply effects across one or more elements
• Computing complex visual patterns
• Simulates the show without hardware
• Free and commercial sequences can be adapted
Raspberry Pi Pixel Driver
• Software library- Generate pixel serial data
• GPIO pin 18 – direct drive
• 3.3V data output
• WS-2811/2812 pixels expect 5v
• Works, but suboptimal
Raspberry Pi Pixel Driver
Better than direct drive:
• Buffered outputs
• 12V and 5V pixel options
• Two strings of 800+ pixels 
• Bonus: real time clock
Buying Pixels
• Direct from China
• “Pre-sales” – group buys
• eBay and Amazon
• Specialty Sellers
Consider form factor and voltage (5V/12V)
Matrix Displays
P10 Panels (10MM Pixels) 
Beaglebone Adapter – up to 64 P10 panels
Raspberry Pi Adapter – up to 12 P10 panels
Software: FPP Falcon Player

Water is the Enemy
• Buy weather rated lights
• Clear Silicone Caulk to seal strip ends
• Weatherproof connectors
• Electrical enclosures:
• CG-2000 cable boxes
• Tackle boxes
• Ammo Cans
• Cooling can become an issue
Two challenges
• Voltage drop –
• Can’t push enough current through small wire
• White colors shade to Pink
• Solution: Voltage injection. Power at both ends of 
string
• Distance to first pixel
• Signal corruption
• Solution: “Null pixel” – reshapes signal.
Broadcasting
• Controller outputs audio 
• FM radio station for viewers
• Find an open channel to avoid interference
• https://radio-locator.com/
• Antenna makes a significant difference
• Challenge: clear signal within FCC rules
Skills
• Soldering
• Debugging
• Planning
• Logical thinking
• Creative and artistic design
• Attention to detail
