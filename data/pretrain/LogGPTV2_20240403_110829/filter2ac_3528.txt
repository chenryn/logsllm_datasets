### Title: BotConf 2014 - ZeuS Meets VM: The Story So Far

At the beginning of the year, we observed a shift in the malware landscape. Old Citadel was losing market share, being pushed out by new versions of KINS. This threat was significant enough to be added to the ZeusTracker. Subsequently, the game changed with the introduction of new encryption schemes, which confused researchers. Following this, some antivirus (AV) companies rediscovered other, more stealthy branches of KINS and started giving them fancy names, further complicating the situation. However, given the multitude of mutations, it's understandable that confusion arises.

In this presentation, we will demonstrate methods to distinguish between variants of ZeuS-like malware, determine their versions, and highlight commonalities that can be exploited. We will begin by delving into the internals of ZeuS, showing how key components have evolved over time and identifying elements that persist through all mutations. Along the way, we will provide techniques for handling the most recent mutations to extract configuration details. Ultimately, we will show that it is possible to obtain the most important information without necessarily knowing the specific mutation or version.

The talk will be accompanied by the release of several tools:
- A tool to parse and print BinStruct
- Yara signatures to distinguish between different mutations
- Tricks to expedite analysis
- A service (zdump) that can crack most ZeuS-like malware configurations

By the end of the session, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of the current state of ZeuS-like malware and practical tools to aid in their analysis.
