User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Continuously monitor logs with tail that are occasionally rotated We're using tail to continuously monitor several logs, but when a log is rotated the tail for that file will cease.

As far as I understand, the problem is that when the log is rotated, there is a new file created, and the running tail process doesn't know anything about that new file handle.

Assistant: Ah, there's a flag for this.

instead of using tail -f /var/log/file we should be using tail -F /var/log/file



tail -F translates to tail --follow=name --retry as in;


--follow=name: follow the name of the file instead of the file descriptor
--retry: if the file is inaccessible, try again later instead of dying
