I am attempting to delete records from the datastore, but I encounter a `BadValueError` whenever I try to do so. The error message indicates that the `Districts` field, one of the columns, is required. Due to an issue with the bulk loader, the `Districts` field is null for all rows. However, I still need to clear the datastore to resolve the bulk loader error. What can I do?

**Suggested Solutions:**

1. **Update the Model:**
   Modify your data model to make the `Districts` field optional. You can do this by setting `required=False` for the `Districts` field in your model definition. This change will prevent the validator from complaining about the existing entities, allowing you to delete them.

   ```python
   class YourModel(db.Model):
       # Other fields...
       districts = db.StringProperty(required=False)
   ```

2. **Direct Deletion Using Keys:**
   If you know the keys of the entities you want to delete, you can use the `db.delete()` method to remove them directly without fetching them first. This approach can be more efficient and avoids validation issues.

   ```python
   from google.appengine.ext import db

   # List of entity keys to delete
   keys_to_delete = [key1, key2, key3]

   db.delete(keys_to_delete)
   ```

3. **Using the Datastore Viewer:**
   If you have a small number of entities to delete, you can use the Datastore Viewer available in the Google Cloud Console. This tool allows you to manually delete entities, which can be a straightforward solution for a limited dataset.

   - Navigate to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Go to the Datastore section.
   - Use the Datastore Viewer to find and delete the entities.

By following one of these methods, you should be able to clean out the datastore and address the bulk loader error.
