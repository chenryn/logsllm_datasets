**Title: Kr00k: How KRACKing Amazon Echo Exposed Over a Billion Vulnerable Wi-Fi Devices at Black Hat Asia 2020**

We have identified significant security vulnerabilities in the FullMAC Wi-Fi chipsets manufactured by Broadcom/Cypress and potentially other vendors. These chipsets, which are widely used in Wi-Fi-enabled devices, are susceptible to encrypting network packets with an all-zero encryption key, even when operating on WPA2-protected networks. This vulnerability, designated as CVE-2019-15126, allows an attacker to decrypt certain wireless network packets if exploited successfully.

The scope of this vulnerability is extensive, affecting over a billion devices, including products from major manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, Amazon, and others that utilize these chipsets. To differentiate this issue from previous research, we have named it "Kr00k."

Our investigation began with the discovery that some versions of popular Amazon devices, such as the Echo and Kindle, were vulnerable to Key Reinstallation Attacks (KRACK). After reporting this to Amazon, we delved deeper into the all-zero encryption key variant of KRACK. Our further research revealed that the root cause lies not in the software but in the hardwareâ€”specifically, the Wi-Fi chipsets themselves. This finding significantly broadens the range of affected devices.

During our presentation, we will provide a detailed account of our responsible disclosure process and the successful collaboration with Amazon in developing and deploying patches. We will also present technical insights and a live demonstration, illustrating how we triggered a reassociation to set an all-zero encryption key and subsequently decrypted intercepted packets.

Additionally, we will discuss the potential impact of these vulnerabilities, along with the practical limitations in exploiting them.
