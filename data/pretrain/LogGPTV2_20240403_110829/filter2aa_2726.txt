## Overview
This presentation will explore the evolution and construction of a network disruption bot, often referred to as a "killing robot." We will discuss how these bots are created, their historical context, and the methods used to detect and remove them.

## Creating a Network Disruption Bot
### Key Components
1. **Integration of Technologies**: Combine various technologies, leveraging the strengths of each.
2. **User-Friendly Design**: Make it accessible for a wide range of users, not just elite hackers.
3. **Widespread Distribution**: Distribute the tool to non-technical users.
4. **Automation**: Automate as many processes as possible.
5. **Internet-Based Distribution**: Use the Internet to reduce single points of failure.
6. **Expression through Tools**: Allow users to express themselves through the tools.

### Example Integration
- **IRC (Internet Relay Chat)**: A widely available and easy-to-use application for socializing.
- **DOS (Denial of Service) Tools**: Effective for communicating emotions and evolving in response to new defenses.

## Historical Context

### Early DOS Attacks
- **Ping of Death**: Simple network flood using large or small ping packets.
- **Smurf Attack**: Amplified network flood with faked return addresses.
- **SYN Flood**: Overloads the target machine by sending SYN packets to different ports.

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Tools
- **Trinoo and Stacheldracht**: Faked source IP addresses, harder to track, and more devastating than traditional DOS tools.
- **Media Coverage**: High-profile attacks on major websites like CNN, Yahoo, and eBay.

## Evolution of IRC Bots
### Notable Examples
- **Eggdrop Bot (1993)**: Developed by Jeff Fischer, used to manage IRC channels.
- **BNC (Bouncer)**: An IRC server proxy that hides the user's IP address, providing anonymity and protection from DOS attacks.

### Parallel Evolution
- **IRC Scripts and Bots**: Used for file sharing and channel management.
- **Channel Wars and Netsplits**: Bots started to cause and resolve netsplits, leading to more sophisticated attacks.

### Denial of Service
- **Early DOS**: Caused by poorly written software and shell scripts.
- **Mid-1990s**: Introduction of simple and amplified network floods.
- **Distributed DOS**: Scripted and remotely controlled, with tools like Trinoo and Stacheldracht making headlines.

## Modern Network Disruption Robots
### Features
- **Control via IRC**: Bots can scan, break into systems, and carry out DOS attacks on demand.
- **DOSnets**: Networks of machines that can perform DOS attacks, turning them into DDoS attacks.

### DoSnet Tools
- **Automation**: Reduces the need for manual setup and maintenance.
- **Flexibility**: Can run various programs, such as Ping of death, fragmented IGMP flood, and IRC channel flooding.

### Infection Methods
- **Trojaned Files**: Sent via email attachments.
- **Web Browser Exploits**: Download and run bots in stealth mode.
- **Weak Passwords**: Exploited to install bots.
- **Existing Trojans**: Leveraged to spread further.

### Notable Bots
- **Evilbot**: A backdoor Windows trojan that copies itself and adds registry keys.
- **GTBot (Global Threat Bot)**: A modified mIRC client with various bot scripts, runs in stealth mode.
- **SDBot**: Connects to IRC servers, receives commands, and can execute remote files and act as an IRC proxy.

## Detection and Removal
### Detection
- **Mailing Lists**: Subscribe to lists like FIRST and NSP for alerts.
- **Port Monitoring**: Look for traffic on port 6667.
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)**: Use tools like Snort to spot unencrypted traffic.
- **Packeteer**: Identify top DCC talkers and high traffic.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Observe formulaic nicknames and repeated joins in IRC channels.

### Removal
- **Tools**: Use security software like Lockdown Corp's LockDown 2000 or SwatIt!.
- **Registry Keys**: Delete the registry key created by the bot.
- **File Deletion**: Remove the bot files after ensuring the process is stopped.
- **Antivirus Software**: Use tools like McAfee or F-Secure Anti-Virus.
