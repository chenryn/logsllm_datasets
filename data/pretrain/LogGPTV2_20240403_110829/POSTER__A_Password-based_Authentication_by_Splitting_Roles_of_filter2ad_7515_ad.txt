### Practical Strength and User Behavior in Grid-Based Passwords

As previously mentioned, the practical strength of grid-based passwords also needs to be explained. A study was conducted to examine how users select cells as their password in grids of different sizes. Figures 4-6 to 4-11 illustrate the cell selection patterns of approximately two hundred volunteers who participated in the study. Each figure presents a heat map that represents the frequency of cell selection. Darker colors (red) indicate cells selected by a higher percentage of users, while lighter colors (green) represent cells selected by very few or no users. The numbers in the figures denote the percentage of users who selected each specific cell.

**Figure 4-6. Cell Selection in a 30-Cell Grid**

**Figure 4-7. Cell Selection in a 60-Cell Grid**

**Figure 4-8. Cell Selection in a 90-Cell Grid**

**Figure 4-9. Cell Selection in a 120-Cell Grid**

**Figure 4-10. Cell Selection in a 150-Cell Grid**

**Figure 4-11. Cell Selection in a 180-Cell Grid**

From the heat maps, it is evident that participants tended to choose cells on the left-hand side of the grid, particularly in the top-left area. The right-hand side, especially the bottom-right area, was significantly less popular, with many cells remaining unselected. Specifically, in the 120-cell grid, 26 cells were not chosen by any user, accounting for 21.67% of the available cells. In the 150-cell and 180-cell grids, 57 and 63 cells, respectively, were not selected, representing 38.00% and 35.00% of the total cells.

The way users select cells directly impacts the security of the grid. When many cells remain unselected, the combination space (the number of possible cell selection combinations) decreases, making it easier for an adversary to perform a brute-force attack on the grid-based authentication mechanism.

To confirm this, Table 4-5 shows the physical strength of the 60-cell, 90-cell, 120-cell, 150-cell, and 180-cell grids, indicating a reduction in the number of possible combinations compared to the theoretical strength in Table 4-4.

**Table 4-5. Physical Strength of Each Grid to Withstand Brute Force**

| Grid Size (Number of Cells) | Strength (Number of Possible Combinations) | Percentage of Strength Reduction |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 60                          | 1,652,411,475 + 108                        | 35.42%                           |
| 90                          | 48,124,511,370 + 108                       | 37.92%                           |
| 120                         | 111,315,063,717 + 108                      | 86.75%                           |
| 150                         | 101,841,441,273 + 108                      | 98.06%                           |
| 180                         | 681,927,413,310 + 108                      | 97.08%                           |

Figures 4-6 to 4-11 clearly show that larger grid sizes result in a higher number of unchosen cells, which in turn reduces the strength against brute-force attacks. For example, the 150-cell and 180-cell grids have their strength reduced by almost 100%, while the 120-cell grid's strength is decreased by almost 90%. This implies that an attacker would need to perform significantly fewer attempts to crack these grids compared to the theoretical expectations.

### Recall-Based Systems

A recall-based grid password system, also known as a drawmetric system, requires users to draw, recall, and reproduce a secret drawing on a grid. The first such system, called Draw a Secret (DAS), was introduced in 1999. Users draw on a 2D grid using a stylus or mouse, and the drawing serves as the graphical password template. During authentication, users redraw their picture to match the template.

**Figure 4-12. Draw-a-Secret System**

In detail, the usability of DAS has not been extensively studied, but one study found that users tend to draw simple images with one to three strokes, achieving an authentication success rate of only 57-80%. The theoretical password space for a 5x5 grid with a maximum length of 12 is 258, comparable to text passwords. However, users often create predictable passwords with just one, two, or three simple lines.

Improvements on DAS include the BDAS scheme, which adds a background image to encourage more complex drawings, and Passdoodle, which allows freehand drawing and uses a more sophisticated password matching method considering line count, color, and drawing speed.

Another well-known recall-based system is the Pass-Go scheme, proposed in 2008, inspired by the Chinese board game Go. Users select intersections on the grid as their password, and during authentication, they reselect the correct points.

**Figure 4-13. Pass-Go Scheme**

Pass-Go offers a large theoretical password space, similar to a 256-bit password, but it is still vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks. Usability tests with over 160 users showed a 78% authentication success rate, higher than DAS.

### Android Pattern Lock

The Android pattern lock, introduced in 2008, is a recall-based system where users connect dots in a 3x3 grid to create a pattern. The pattern must use at least four and up to nine dots, with no jumps allowed unless a dot has already been selected.

**Figure 4-14. Android Lock Pattern**

The pattern space is limited, with only 389,112 possible combinations. Research shows that 44% of patterns start at the top-left dot, and 77% start at one of the four corners. The average pattern uses five dots, resulting in only 7,152 combinations, far fewer than the 4 billion combinations of a four-character password. Patterns are often drawn from left to right and top to bottom, making them easy to guess.

**Table 4-6. Theoretical Strength of Android Pattern Lock**

| Length (Number of Dots) | Theoretical Strength (Number of Possible Combinations) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 4                       | 1,624                                                  |
| 5                       | 7,152                                                  |
| 6                       | 26,016                                                 |
| 7                       | 72,912                                                 |
| 8                       | 140,704                                                |
| 9                       | 140,704                                                |
| Total                   | 389,112                                                |

Shoulder surfing attacks are also a significant concern. One study found that it was possible to crack a pattern lock in five attempts 95% of the time using video recordings. Commonly used patterns often mimic letters of the alphabet, further reducing security.

**Figure 4-15. Examples of Weak Android Lock Patterns**

To enhance security, users should choose more complex patterns, though this may affect memorability.

### Summary

Passwords, as a "something-you-know" method, are the most popular form of authentication. This chapter discusses methods to generate stronger passwords and store them securely, including dynamic salt generation and placement. It also explores alternative graphical password systems, such as grid-based and recall-based schemes, including the widely used Android pattern lock.
