**Current behavior**  
Service's method can't access the service attribute when called from a child
component of ChildModule with `this` if the service is declared in the
providers array of AppModule and ChildModule.
**Expected behavior**  
An error need to spawn to warning the duplicated declaration of the service.
Because without this error I searched for 3 days where was the problem in my
service /or/ my component trying everything but nothing was working, then I
just removed the service from my ChildModule and it was working fine.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
I tried to make a Plunker, but I can't manage to setup the router on it, so
it's not representative because it seems we need to load the sub-module with
the router loadChildren method.
You can see the code issuing this problem on my Github here (protected
branch): https://github.com/SherlockStd/ME4N-Starter/tree/this-error/src/app
Here is the main structure of the files:
    src/
    ├── app.component.html
    ├── app.component.ts
    ├── app.module.ts <== provide AuthenticationService
    ├── app.routes.ts <== load authentication.module with router.loadChildren()
    │
    ├── +authentication/
    │   ├── authentication.component.html
    │   ├── authentication.component.ts
    │   ├── authentication.module.ts <== provide AuthenticationService
    │   ├── authentication.routes.ts <== expose a route to login component
    │   └── login
    │       ├── login.component.html
    │       └── login.component.ts <== using service's methods here don't work
    │
    └── shared/
        └── services/
            ├── authentication.service.ts
            └── base.service.ts
What I mean by `login.component.ts <== using service's methods here don't
work` is that the service is unable to set his own attributes, it can read
them but can't write.
If we provide `AuthenticationService` only in `app.module.ts`, instead of both
`app.module.ts` and `authentication.module.ts` (), the problem is solved.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
If something like this break the context, we need to display an error
explaining why.
