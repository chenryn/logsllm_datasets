User: How to optimize inefficient SQL queries to improve the query performance of the database?
Assistant: Optimizing inefficient SQL queries may start from the following aspects: 1. Index optimization. By establishing a suitable index, the efficiency of the query can be improved. Consider creating appropriate single-column or joint indexes, and avoiding excessive duplicate indexes. 2. Query optimization. When optimizing queries, you can consider reducing the number of table accesses, batch processing data, using internal memory sorting, using optimal connection methods, making full use of caches, and avoiding resource-wasting operations such as SELECT*. 3. Optimization of database structure. Improve query performance by adjusting the structure of the database. You can consider optimizing the data structure by splitting large tables vertically or horizontally, merging irrelevant fields, merging large fields, etc. 4. Query cache optimization. You can enable query cache to store frequently queried result sets, reduce query IO operations, and improve query performance. 5. Code optimization. At the code level, query performance can be optimized by writing optimized SQL statements, reducing unnecessary data processing, and avoiding excessive ORM mapping. In short, if you want to optimize inefficient SQL queries, you need to fully understand the basic principles of the database, analyze the performance bottlenecks of the query in depth, and consider the optimization of the above-mentioned aspects to improve the performance of the database.
