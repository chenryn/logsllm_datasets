a fair share u′
dst, respectively, from their local do-
mains. Similar to Theorems 1–3, we can show guarantees for
the sender and receiver by replacing usrc with u′
src and ddst
with d′
dst in the proofs above. Moreover, because the num-
ber of dynamic channel setup requests within the static class
is small and bounded, STRIDE can provide guaranteed high
bandwidth to ﬂows established through static channels. An
interesting observation is that since compromised endhosts
send traﬃc all the time whereas uncompromised endhosts
do not, the available bandwidth is much higher than the
fair share if the domain contains fewer bots.
Resilience against DoC and N 2 Attacks. Theorems 1
and 2 imply that a DoC attacker (1) cannot crowd out a ca-
pability request if the request is placed along a static channel
with a private path, and (2) can delay a capability request at
most by time linear to the static allocation of other domains
if the request uses a public path. These bounds are inde-
pendent of the size or distribution of the botnet. Theorem 3
implies that STRIDE can defend against the N 2 attack as
the guaranteed ﬂow bandwidth between the source and des-
tination ADs is unaﬀected by bots outside those ADs.
7. EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate STRIDE with respect to its ef-
fectiveness against DDoS attacks. We show the eﬀectiveness
of end-to-end bandwidth guarantees under large-scale attack
scenarios. We also test the packet forwarding performance
of STRIDE via real-ﬁeld implementation.
For realistic simulation, we use a
Simulation setup.
CAIDA AS-relationship dataset to construct a TD; a tier-1
AD connecting to 2164 endpoint ADs is chosen as the TDC.
Although the AS-relationship dataset does not include all
interface-level paths, our analysis of the dataset reveals that
AD-level path diversity is high enough to support STRIDE’s
path control and hence to evaluate STRIDE’s path construc-
tion. Speciﬁcally, the endpoint ADs in the dataset have more
than 40 diﬀerent paths to the TDC on average. If interface-
level paths are constructed, path diversity at endpoint ADs
would become much higher since the number of paths grows
exponentially as PCBs propagate downstream.
Bandwidth allocation. During PCB propagation, each
AD allocates bandwidth to each child AD proportional to
the child size. We assume that the size of an AD is propor-
tional to its degree.
7.1 Resilience against DoC Attacks
We evaluate the resilience of STRIDE against DoC at-
tacks, under the following simulation scenario. We randomly
label one hundred ADs as clean (i.e., ADs containing no
bots) and conﬁgure them to send traﬃc to a destination
AD using 10 diﬀerent down-paths (i.e., k=10), with a send
rate equal to one tenth of the down-path capacity. Hence,
in the absence of attacks, all down-paths are fully (but not
overly) utilized. Then, we randomly label ADs as contam-

inated (ADs containing bots) and set their send rate equal
to that of a clean AD so as to make individual contami-
nated ADs indistinguishable from clean ones. The number
of contaminated ADs is increased from 0 to 300.
We evaluate the eﬀectiveness of STRIDE against the
above attacks in the following two scenarios.
1. Public Paths: All clean and contaminated ADs use the
k activated down-paths to setup capabilities with the
destination AD.
2. Public and Private Paths: Half of the clean ADs use
a private down-path that was provided to the source
ADs via a secret out-of-band channel. Meanwhile, the
remaining half of the clean ADs and contaminated ADs
use the public paths as before.
As an evaluation metric, we use the admission ratio, which
is deﬁned as the percentage of the legitimate packets (i.e.,
packets from the clean domains) that successfully traverse
the bottleneck link/path.
Figure 4 shows that when all source ADs use the public
paths (“All”), the admission ratio of the legitimate packets
decreases as more contaminated ADs are added since the
per-AD bandwidth decreases. When half of the clean ADs
acquire a private path from the destination (“Private”), their
packets are unaﬀected by the attack as the 100% admission
ratio shows; and the packets of the remaining half of the
clean ADs (“Public”) obtained higher admission ratio along
the public paths because the use of the private path reduced
bandwidth contention along the public paths. This result il-
lustrates how destination ADs can protect their valued cus-
tomers’ traﬃc from DDoS attacks in STRIDE.
While STRIDE enables private parties to use private
paths to avoid congested static paths, it also protects clean
ADs’ traﬃc from large-scale DDoS attacks via packet pri-
oritization: i.e., capability requests made through the static
up-paths would have a higher priority than others through
the best-eﬀort up-paths. To examine this, we use the fol-
lowing simulation scenario: the attack strength is increased
(by adding more attack sources within contaminated ADs)
up to 10 times the bandwidth of the static up-paths; source
ADs put the high priority marking on their outbound pack-
ets such that the bandwidth of high priority packets would
not exceed that of the static up-paths (e.g., if the attack
strength grows 10 times, 90% of attack packets would have a
low priority marking). Legitimate source endhosts, on iden-
tifying congestion on static down-paths, use the best-eﬀort
down-paths; and attack source endhosts use the same path
selection strategy as that of the legitimate sources to maxi-
mize their eﬀects. The above attack scenario is the strongest
attack scenario we consider for the given number of legiti-
mate and attack sources since all packets from the 100 clean
and 300 contaminated ADs compete for the bandwidth of
public paths.
Figure 5: Eﬀects of attack strength.
Figure 5 shows that even if the attack strength grows,
the eﬀects on legitimate traﬃc are marginal: attack sources,
regardless of their strength, can only consume bandwidth
proportional to their fair share both on the static and the
best-eﬀort channels. Meanwhile, 25% of legitimate packets
sent through the static down-paths reach their destination
without loss, and the other legitimate packets (i.e., 75% of
them) sent through the best-eﬀort channel reach the desti-
nation with a ratio close to 66.7%. Overall, 75% of the le-
gitimate requests overcome the massive DDoS attack whose
total send rate is 30 times higher than that of the legit-
imate sources, even if routers cannot distinguish between
legitimate and attack packets. The ﬁgure also shows that
without packet prioritization, the admission ratio of legiti-
mate packets decreases as attack strength grows. This result
shows the eﬀectiveness of using static up-path and packet
prioritization in STRIDE.
7.2 Flow Bandwidth Guarantees
STRIDE’s bandwidth guarantees eﬀectively isolate the
bandwidth of attack traﬃc from that of legitimate traﬃc.
As a consequence, in STRIDE, the eﬀects of attacks are
conﬁned within the paths they follow regardless of whether
attack sources ﬂood a single path (or a link) or multiple
paths simultaneously. We show this bandwidth isolation via
large-scale simulations. For realistic simulations, we con-
struct simulation topologies using a CAIDA SkitterMap [2],
attach 10,000 legitimate sources to 200 ADs proportional
to the AD size, and attach attack sources (hosts) to 100
ADs. Paths are probabilistically sampled from the Skit-
terMap to satisfy both the number of sources and the num-
ber of ADs. Legitimate sources control their packet sending
rate based on the TCP congestion control mechanism, while
attack sources send constant, high-rate traﬃc to ﬂood a tar-
get link. We increase the attack size from 10K to 100K to
compare STRIDE’s bandwidth guarantees with those of a
per-ﬂow fair-sharing based mechanism. We consider a base-
line case, labeled as “No Defense”, where packets are ran-
domly dropped during congestion.
Figure 6 shows the bandwidth used by the legitimate ﬂows
that originate from clean ADs. Under “No Defense”, the
legitimate ﬂows obtain almost no bandwidth. DDoS at-

Figure 7: The eﬀects of attack dispersion.
ployed, attack ﬂows cannot completely exhaust the target’s
link bandwidth, yet the attack eﬀects grow linearly with the
attack size.
STRIDE provides consistent bandwidth guarantees to le-
gitimate traﬃc under diﬀerent attack sizes, which proves the
eﬀectiveness of path bandwidth isolation. The bandwidth of
legitimate ﬂows decreases slightly as the attack size grows,
because (1) the extra bandwidth that is not fully used by
some paths (due to the TCP congestion control) is shared
by other ﬂows, and (2) as the number of contaminated ADs
increases, the number of clean ADs decreases (as the total
number of ADs is ﬁxed).
Next, we increase the number of contaminated ADs by
10 up to 200 ADs. As one can imagine, the bandwidth of
legitimate ﬂows decreases as Figure 7 shows. However, the
eﬀects of attack dispersion are marginal (i.e., proportional
to the number of attack ADs) because the dynamic channel
bandwidth is proportional to the static channel bandwidth
and the static channel bandwidth that can be used by attack
traﬃc is limited by the number of attack ADs in STRIDE.
7.3 Throughput
STRIDE introduces additional computational work for ca-
pability (or opaque ﬁeld) veriﬁcation. To gauge the compu-
tational overhead, we measure the throughput of a STRIDE
router for various packet sizes and compare the result with
that of the default IPv4 forwarding. We implement a
STRIDE router as a user-space process using the Click Mod-
ular Router [10]. The capability generation and veriﬁcation
are implemented as CBC-MAC with AES-ni. We perform
the measurement with a simple topology where a source
and a destination are directly attached to a STRIDE router.
NetPerf [3] is used for throughput measurement.
As described earlier, STRIDE forwards packets based on
the interface identiﬁer in the packet header; hence, unlike in
today’s routers, no overhead will be incurred for FIB (for-
warding table) lookup. Meanwhile, the IPv4 forwarding in
our experiments would produce the highest throughput that
it can achieve since the FIB has only one entry in our net-
work conﬁguration.
Figure 8 shows that for small packets, both IPv4 and
STRIDE routers under-utilize the link bandwidth while the
IPv4 packet forwarding outperforms that of STRIDE; for
