    PowerToys version: 0.18.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): Settings
# Steps to reproduce
Install as Admin  
Log on as Admin and configure (including run at startup)  
Log off  
Log on as Standard User  
Launch Settings
# Expected behavior
Standard User can configure Settings, settings dialogue has headings and text
the same as Admin (minus Admin features)
# Actual behavior
Settings dialogue is lacking all text for Standard User. As it loads there is
a brief flash of the text that should be there, but by the time the user can
click on any thing, the text is gone and the dialogue had nothing visible to
click on (see screenshot)
