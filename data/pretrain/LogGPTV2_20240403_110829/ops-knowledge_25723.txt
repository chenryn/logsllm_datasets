User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Supervisor not loading new configuration files I have a problem deploying Django app using Gunicorn and Supervisor. While I can make Gunicorn serving my app (by setting proper PYTHONPATH and running apropriate command, the one from supervisord config) I can't make supervisor to run it. It just won't see my app. I don't know how to make sure if the config file is ok. 

Here's what supervisorctl says:

# supervisorctl start myapp_live
myapp_live: ERROR (no such process)


I'm running it on Ubuntu 10.04 with following config:

File /home/myapp/live/deploy/supervisord_live.ini:

[program:myapp_live]
command=/usr/local/bin/gunicorn_django --log-file /home/myapp/logs/gunicorn_live.log --log-level info --workers 2 -t 120 -b 127.0.0.1:10000 -p deploy/gunicorn_live.pid webapp/settings_live.py
directory=/home/myapp/live
environment=PYTHONPATH='/home/myapp/live/eco/lib'
user=myapp
autostart=true
autorestart=true


In /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf, at the end of the file, there is:

[include]
files = /etc/supervisor/conf.d/*.conf


and here's a symlink to my config file:

# ls -la /etc/supervisor/conf.d
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   48 Dec  4 18:02 myapp-live.conf -&gt; /home/myapp/live/deploy/supervisord_live.ini


everything looks fine for me but supervisorctl just keep saying myapp_live: ERROR (no such process). Any solution for this?

Assistant: The correct answer is that supervisor requires you to re-read and update when you place a new configuration file. Restarting is not the answer, as that will affect other services. Try:

supervisorctl reread
supervisorctl update
