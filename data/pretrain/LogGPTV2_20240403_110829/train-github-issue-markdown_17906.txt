When concatting two dataframes where there are a) there are duplicate columns
in one of the dataframes, and b) there are non-overlapping column names in
both, then you get a IndexError:
    In [9]: df1 = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(3,3), columns=['A', 'A', 'B1'])
       ...: df2 = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(3,3), columns=['A', 'A', 'B2'])
    In [10]: pd.concat([df1, df2])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "", line 1, in 
        pd.concat([df1, df2])
    ...
      File "c:\users\vdbosscj\scipy\pandas-joris\pandas\core\index.py", line 765, in take
        taken = self.view(np.ndarray).take(indexer)
    IndexError: index 3 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 3
I don't know if it should work (although I suppose it should, as with only the
duplicate columns it does work), but at least the error message is not really
helpfull.
