**ATT&CK ID:** S0604  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Industroyer

The OPC (OLE for Process Control) module of Industroyer can perform brute-force attacks on values. During such an attack, it sends a status code of `0x01` to the target systems. This status code is interpreted as "Primary Variable Out of Limits," which can mislead operators into misunderstanding the actual status of protective relays. [4]
