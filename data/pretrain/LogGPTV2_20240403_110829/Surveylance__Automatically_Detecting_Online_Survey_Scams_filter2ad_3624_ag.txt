APPENDIX
A. Third-party Inclusions in Survey Gateways
To motivate our use of third-party script incidence as a
feature, we compared the usage of third-party scripts (e.g.,
advertisements) in survey gateways to benign survey pages.
Figure 8 shows the number of unique third-party scripts used as
advertisement on survey gateways versus the number of unique
third-party scripts referenced by the baseline benign survey
pages. The plot clearly shows that survey gateways include
signiﬁcantly more third-party scripts to benign survey pages.

scam pages.

B. Interacting with Survey Gateways
Our preliminary experiment on 10 survey gateways showed
that the transmitted data to servers varies if different browser
conﬁgurations and IP addresses are used, albeit providing
identical responses to the initial set of questions (e.g. age,
gender). To better explore this, we conducted a larger scale
study on 200 randomly selected survey gateways to infer
potential information ﬂow into survey gateways.
Our analysis consists of two phases. In the ﬁrst phase, we
visited each survey gateway multiple times with an identical
browser proﬁle (i.e., same IP address and browser user-agent)
and collected raw network traces. The goal of this phase is to
construct a complete picture of the network behavior of a given
survey gateway. Note that determining the number of times to
visit a gateway website in order to draw a comprehensive view
of its network behavior strongly depends on the complexity of
network traces between the survey gateway and the browser.
For example, the number and sources of non-deterministic
parameters usually vary from website to website and can
have signiﬁcant impacts on our analysis in this experiment.
By performing a differential analysis on the collected traces,
we empirically observed that running the ﬁrst phase of the
experiment three times is sufﬁcient to reach convergence and
identify potential discrepancies in the traces for a large number
of websites in our dataset.
To this end, we collected the raw HTTP trafﬁc sent to
survey gateways and also monitored their interactions with
browser features such as WebStorage APIs (i.e., LocalStorage,
SessionStorage). We then checked the raw HTTP trafﬁc and
searched for values by string comparison to ﬁnd any potential
sources of non-determinism. We used similar techniques that
prior work [40] employed to extract speciﬁc values in the
network trafﬁc. In fact, we labeled any parameters that varied
during the ﬁrst phase in which we did not alter any source
of information. We then combined all the traces and deﬁned
the behavior summary of the given survey gateway, which
was then used in the second phase of the experiment. In the
second phase, after visiting the survey gateway with a different
browser user-agent, we monitored the information sent
to
the server to identify potential sources of non-determinism.
Figure 9 illustrates a simpliﬁed version of our experiment on
one of the survey gateways.
From the 200 randomly selected survey gateways, we
observed that 144 (72%) of them were interacting with browser
WebStorage APIs by calling set and get functions. However,
112 (56%) of all the websites did not reach convergence during
the ﬁrst phase of our analysis, or we were not able to extract
any particular patterns due to multiple levels of encoding.
Our empirical analysis on the network traces shows that
among all the remaining 88 (44%) cases, the most common
sources of non-determinism were timestamps, dates, cookies
or session identiﬁers assigned by gateways. This experiment
clearly implies that the interaction with survey gateways relies
on creating and maintaining unique IDs for visiting users. In
fact, survey gateways differentiate among visiting users and
redirect them to survey publishers based on their browser
conﬁguration and responses to the initial set of questions.
However, we cannot claim that the interaction between survey
gateways and publishers relies solely on the set of unique
IDs that we observed by interacting with survey gateways.

Furthermore, we do not know whether adversaries use any
speciﬁc technique besides the user-agent analysis, nor have
we investigated enough to make statistically signiﬁcant claims
about any particular types of ﬁngerprinting techniques.

with survey gateways. In the ﬁrst phase, we create a behavior
summary of a given survey gateway by visiting the website

C. Exposing Victims to Scam Pages After Filling Out a Survey
Page
After completing a survey, victims are redirected to a new
page, and are usually asked to enter sensitive information, such
as a credit card number, along with other information to receive
rewards. Figure 10 shows an example of a scam page after
completing a survey.
