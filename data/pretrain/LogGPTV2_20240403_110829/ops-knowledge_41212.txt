User: I am currently trying to develop something using Google AppEngine, I am using Python as my runtime and require some advise on setting up the following.
I am running a webserver that provides JSON data to clients, The data comes from an external service in which I have to pull the data from.
What I need to be able to do is run a background system that will check the memcache to see if there are any required ID's, if there is an ID I need to fetch some data for that ID from the external source and place the data in the memecache.
If there are multiple id's, > 30 I need to be able to pull all 30 request as quickly and efficiently as possible.
I am new to Python Development and AppEngine so any advise you guys could give would be great.
Thanks.
Assistant: You can use "backends" or "task queues" to run processes in the background.  Tasks have a 10-minute run time limit, and backends have no run time limit.  There's also a cronjob mechanism which can trigger requests at regular intervals.
You can fetch the data from external servers with the "URLFetch" service.
