User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I report SQL Injection attacks (e.g. to User's ISP)? EDIT : Sorry, my question clearly wasn't clear. I don't want to report attempted server attacks internally; we already have systems that log. record and report that activity.

What I was keen to do was to report the attacks to the perpetrator's ISP or somesuch.

Original question:

Our sites are immune to SQL Injection (AFAIK!), but of course we still get targeted regularly.

Is there some way I could automate reporting of attempted attacks - reverse DNS lookup etc.?

Although I guess its only worthwhile if, overall, it would be doing the community a favour.

Ditto I suppose for all the other attacks we see - probing for wide-open BBS, MySQL, PHPAdmin, etc.

Assistant: Donate your logs to SANS!  They have a client for most firewalls that will pull the logs and send them to the DShield database.
