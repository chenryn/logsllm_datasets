### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**
    * 9.0.0, 9.0.4
  * **Operating System:**
    * Windows 10
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:**
    * 
### Expected Behavior
  * Ctrl - should not zoom out the window (preferred) OR
  * Ctrl - (using the minus that is not on the numpad) zoom out should be reversible with Ctrl + to zoom in
### Actual Behavior
When you hit `Ctrl` \+ `-` (using the - on the keyboard, not the one on the
numpad), electron causes the zoom factor to change.
### To Reproduce
Run electron.exe  
Click `Ctrl` \+ `-` (use the minus on the main keyboard, not the numpad)  
The window will zoom out and you cannot zoom back in with `Ctrl` \+ `+`

### Additional Information
After some debugging in the browser, I discovered that `Ctrl` \+ `-` on the
keyboard actually seems to trigger a `Ctrl` \+ `Shift` \+ `-`. This might be
the problem.
