User: I have LibreOffice installed on a Windows machine.  LibreOffice comes with a bundled python.exe (version 3.3) to allow you to write LibreOffice macros in Python.  This works fine.  But the bundled python routines don't come with the IDLE python ide as far as I can see.
1) If I download and install Python on my machine will that interfere with the execution of LibreOffice python macros (by changing Python environmental variables, register settings etc.?
or
2) Is there a way to download IDLE or another free Python IDE and have it work with the Python bundled into LibreOffice?
Assistant: Unless LibreOffice was programmed sloppy, it should not
That would not be smart: using bundled software for anything else than what it was bundled for would not be smart
