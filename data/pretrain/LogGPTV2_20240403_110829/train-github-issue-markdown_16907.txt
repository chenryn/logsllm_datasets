Bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
When rendering with a suspense config, time spent before rendering appears to
be subtracted from the timeout of the suspense config. If I spend 1 second
before triggering an update with a suspense config with a timeout of 2
seconds, it takes only 1 second before the tree suspends.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster
if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**
  * Open PR with failing test (#17015)
  * Create CodeSandbox with example (https://codesandbox.io/s/suspense-config-test-sw3fn)  
In the sandbox, any time spent before click "Next page", reduces the time the
pending state is shown before suspending. If you wait longer than 2 seconds,
it immediately suspends.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
I would expect the timeout of the suspense config to count from when the
update is triggered.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
Any version that allows rendering with a suspense config
