**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Use Recent OS Version

**Description:**
- **iOS 11**: Introduced a first-come-first-served principle for URI handling. This means that only the app that was installed first and registered for a specific URI scheme will be launched when that URI is invoked.
- **Android 6 (Marshmallow)**: Introduced App Links, which provide a more secure and predictable way to handle URLs by associating them with a specific app.

This technique highlights the importance of using recent operating system versions to leverage new security features and enhancements.
