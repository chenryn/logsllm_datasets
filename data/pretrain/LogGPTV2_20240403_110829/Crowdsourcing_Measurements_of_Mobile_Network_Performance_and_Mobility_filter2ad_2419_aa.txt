Abstract. Cellular infrastructure in urban areas is provisioned to easily
cope with the usual daily demands. When facing shockingly high loads,
e.g., due to large scale sport or music events, users complain about perfor-
mance degradations of the mobile network. Analyzing the impact of large
scale events on the mobile network infrastructure and how users perceive
overload situations is essential to improve user experience. Therefore, a
large data set is required to get a detailed understanding of the diﬀerences
between providers, mobile devices, mobile network access technologies,
and the mobility of people.
In this paper, we present experiences and results from a crowdsourc-
ing measurement during a music festival in Germany with over 110,000
visitors per day. More than 1,000 visitors ran our crowdsourcing app to
collect active and passive measurements of the mobile network and the
user mobility. We show that there is signiﬁcant performance degradation
during the festival regarding DNS and HTTP failures as well as increased
load times. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the carrier, the access
technology, and the user mobility on the perceived performance.
1 Introduction
Network providers are facing rapidly increasing mobile data traﬃc [1]. Their cel-
lular infrastructure is provisioned to easily cope with the usual daily demands.
High demand peaks at events with thousands of users in a small area, how-
ever, are highly challenging for the infrastructure. Figure 1 shows the venue of a
music festival, the Schloßgrabenfest 1, on a normal day and during the event. This
paper investigates the question how the network performance of the user devices
is aﬀected by large scale events. Understanding how users perceives overload sit-
uations requires a large data set. Especially for a comparison between diﬀerent

network providers, mobile devices, and access technologies, a systematic study
with actively controlled measurements on the user devices is required.
Based on these considerations, we developed a crowdsourcing app which
actively measures network performance during events. The app measures the
performance of diﬀerent network protocols (e.g. HTTP and DNS), the network
paths, the used network technologies, the signal strengths, and location data.
As this app is executed on the user’s device, the results represent the actual
performance perceived by the user and are not limited to certain carriers. With
this app, we took a large measurement during the Schloßgrabenfest 2015, a music
festival with more than 110,000 visitors per day. More than 1,000 participants
ran the crowdsourcing app, allowing detailed analysis of the event.
In this paper, we (i) present our crowdsourcing measurement app, (ii) provide
a ﬁrst look at the measurements2 on end user devices during a large scale event,
and (iii) investigate the impact of the high load on the network performance.
We especially analyze how the HTTP and DNS performance suﬀers depending
on the location, the time, and the network carrier. Furthermore, we brieﬂy show
insights from additionally measured data, such as Bluetooth beacons.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents the
crowdsourcing app, the venue, and a summary of the collected data. Based on a
discussion of the location data in Sect. 3, we analyze the HTTP performance in
Sect. 4 in detail. Section 5 brieﬂy investigates the DNS performance, traceroute
results, and traﬃc statistics. Section 6 presents related work. Finally, Sect. 7
concludes the paper and gives an overview of future work.
2 Methodology and Data Set
Venue: The Schloßgrabenfest is the biggest music festival in the state of Hesse in
Germany. During the festival, the city center of Darmstadt, a city with approxi-
mately 150,000 inhabitants, is highly crowded (Fig. 1). The event takes four days
(Thursday till Sunday) and has more than 110,000 visitors per day.
Crowdsourcing App: We advertised Research4Reﬁll, our crowdsourcing app
for Android smartphones, in local print media3, local television, social media,

the university campus, and on the video screen during the festival. In our adver-
tisement, we stressed that users help us to understand their network problems.
As additional incentive, we oﬀered a free drink for users who ran the app. We
found more than 1,000 users willing to give up some privacy for a free beer.
As we were focusing on a very large data set with as many participants as
possible, we limited the amount of collected data to preserve privacy and to avoid
scaring oﬀ potential participants. The app tracks the location (GPS, network,
and additional placed Bluetooth Beacons), the WiFi and cellular network state,
and actively executes HTTP, DNS, and traceroute measurements. Additionally,
we asked all users to ﬁll in a short questionnaire. Thus, the app does not track
the actual transferred user data and requires minimal rights.
Data Set: The app automatically started on all devices at 18:00 and stopped at
02:00 (on Sunday, the app started earlier). Figure 2 shows the number of partici-
pating users during the festival. The number decreased per day. We assume that
this happens due to the higher energy consumption which drained the battery.
We concentrate our further analysis on Thursday, as this is the day with the
highest number of participants at the venue (at once up to 194). On Thursday,
the number of participants at the venue decreases earlier than on the other days,
as Friday was a workday. The feature to continue measurements tomorrow led
to an unintended increase of participants at midnight, as many devices suddenly
continued to measure. The feature should have continued tomorrow evening.
In total, 1,401 participants ran our app. According to GPS information, 740
of these were at least one time at the venue, and 410 participants were at the
venue on Thursday. We identiﬁed 252 additional smartphones at the venue due
to Bluetooth beacon signals, 135 of these users were at the venue on Thursday.
Thus, out of 110,000 visitors of the venue on Thursday, 545 (≈ 0.5 %) run our
app. Traditional counting of visitors can not track users and therefore sums
up the number of visitors per day. Oﬃcially, 500,000 people visited the event.
Summing up the number of app participants per day leads to 1562 users. Thus,
this method overestimates the number of unique participants by 592 (61 %).
86 % of the devices belonged to one of four leading brands running the
Android OS. Most devices had Android SDK 19 or 21 (58 %). The four Ger-
man mobile carrier were represented with between 21.4 % and 28.3 %, which
does not reﬂect the distribution of all users in Germany.

Limitations: The data has to be interpreted carefully, as the collected data
sample might not be representative. We assume that most participants are tech-
savvy and students. The app might inﬂuence the participants, as they stayed
longer to gain a free drink, or only installed the app if they planned to stay
long. Additionally, the app induced network traﬃc and increased the energy
consumption of the smartphone.
3 Active Measurement: Location
The location information of users is important to understand movement patterns
and investigate possible mitigation strategies, such as ad hoc or delay tolerant
networks. Out of 1,196,875 location measurements, 161,429 location samples are
located in the area of the venue. We discarded location information outside
of this area due to privacy concerns. The app used the network and the GPS
location provider. As 276 devices only returned network locations, we assume
that many users manually turned oﬀ GPS.
In this section, we discuss the distribution of the people, their movement
patterns, the accuracy of the location provider reported by the operating system,
and our experiences with Bluetooth Beacons for location tracking.
3.1 User Density and Movement
Figure 3 visualizes the distribution of the participants on Thursday evening. For
this purpose, we divide the venue in areas and count the number of participants
per area per hour. This implies that people moving between areas in one hour
are counted multiple times. The user density rapidly increases at the beginning
of the event and decreases at midnight. Figure 3 shows that the participants
concentrate in a few areas, which are in front of the main stage of the music
festival. Some participants were located in areas which were inaccessible during
the event. Figure 4 illustrates the user movement. Dark arrows represent many
area transitions, bright arrows a few. Thus, even though the user density in front
of the main stage is high, people are constantly moving between areas. A more
detailed analysis could evaluate the eﬃciency of delay tolerant networks and
placement strategies for access points.

3.2 Location Accuracy and Bluetooth Beacons
As using GPS for location data is often discouraged due to the energy consump-
tion, we investigate the measured accuracy of the samples. Figure 5a shows that
nearly 40 % of all GPS results had an accuracy of less than 20 m, whereas the
network never had such a high accuracy. The network accuracy rapidly decreases
at about 70 %, thus 30 % of all network location samples could not beneﬁt from
seen WiFi access points but relied on cellular networks.
Beside the GPS and network location provider, the app regularly searches
for Bluetooth Beacons. We placed 50 Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons4 at the
venue. We were surprised that most people turned oﬀ Bluetooth immediately
and complained about this measurement. However, 250 devices saw at least 3
Beacons at the same time and can be located with the Beacon information.
As we do not have the ground truth locations, we compare location measure-
ments to investigate diﬀerences between GPS and the Beacons. We distinguish
between the diﬀerence ignoring the reported GPS accuracy, and the diﬀerence
after regarding the GPS accuracy. Figure 5b shows that nearly 50 % of all sam-
ples are equal regarding the GPS accuracy. Ignoring the accuracy, 50 % of all
samples have a diﬀerence of less than 20 m (99 % less than 100 m). The Figure

shows the reported GPS accuracy for those measurements which are diﬀerent
regarding the accuracy. Most of these measurements have an accuracy of less
than 20 m.
4 Active Measurement: HTTP Load Times
In this section, we investigate how the HTTP load time varied during the event.
The app regularly triggered HTTP GET requests to diﬀerent web pages, e.g.,
the front pages of Google, Wikipedia, and Facebook. We measured the load
completion time, but canceled the request after 30 s. In the following, we analyze
the general performance, investigate diﬀerences between carriers, web pages, and
the used network type.
4.1 General Overview
Figure 6a shows the HTTP load time of all devices at the venue on Thursday
evening. With the increasing number of users at the venue, the amount of samples
per time increases. The successful requests increase till 20:00. Between 20:00 and
23:00, the number of failed requests increases rapidly. As there is only a limited
amount of samples after half past midnight, these results are imprecise. The
average HTTP load time and its standard deviation show the same pattern.
To conclude, during the event, both the failure rate and the average load time
