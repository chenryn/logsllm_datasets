### Apache Airflow version
2.4.0
### What happened
Upgraded airflow from 2.1.4 to 2.4.0, did airflow db upgrade, all seems to
work ok  
In the new grid view UI though, we don't seem to be able to see running DAGs
in the default grid view (All run states)  
Filtering for "Running" does show the DAG is actually running, with the latest
DAGRun, I'm just wondering why it doesn't show for All run states, the DAG
runs shown there are 1 run behind.
### What you think should happen instead
Shows all DAG runs from latest backwards, as with old UI
### How to reproduce
Upgrade from 2.1.4 to 2.4 and look at grid view for DAGs that have been
upgraded and have many runs over the past few years.
Not sure if one actually needs to upgrade airflow and db or if the bug is
purely from 2.4 Grid view, probably the latter.
