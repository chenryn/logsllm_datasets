Question: You are tasked with configuring a web server that needs to handle both HTTP and HTTPS requests. Given your knowledge of networking protocols and their use of port numbers, which of the following configurations should you implement to ensure the server correctly receives and processes incoming traffic?
"A": "Assign HTTP requests to port 80 and HTTPS requests to port 443, ensuring that only programs running as root can receive packets on these ports.",
"B": "Use arbitrarily assigned high number ports for both HTTP and HTTPS to avoid conflicts with other applications on the server.",
"C": "Set up the server to accept HTTP requests on any available port and only use port 443 for HTTPS requests.",
"D": "Configure the server to receive all HTTP and HTTPS requests on a single, unique port number that is not reserved."
Answer: A
