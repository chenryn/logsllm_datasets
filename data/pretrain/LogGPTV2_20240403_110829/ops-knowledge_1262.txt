User: Please list and explain each link in the CI/CD process, and point out its role and importance.
Assistant: CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment) is one of the important processes in software development, the purpose is to improve the speed and quality of delivered software. Its main links include: 1. Code repository: Contains all source code and related files. Code submission and management are carried out in this link. 2. Automated build: When the code is submitted to the code warehouse, an automated build tool will automatically trigger the build process. The purpose of this step is to ensure the compilability of the base code. 3. Automated testing: After the build is completed, automated testing tools will execute test cases to ensure the correctness and feasibility of the code. Automated testing can reduce the cost of manual testing and accelerate the speed of software release. 4. Integration testing: After automated building and automated testing, integration testing should be performed on the code to ensure that the coordination of different parts of the code works properly. Integration tests check the interaction between different modules in the code, as well as the interface with external systems. 5. Delivery and Deployment: When the code is tested and verified, the final step is delivery and deployment. This step includes releasing the code to the production environment, ensuring that the code runs stably in the production environment without causing issues. The above are the most basic links in the CI/CD process, but in practice, more links may be involved, such as environmental management and fault management. Through the CI/CD process, the speed and frequency of software release can be accelerated, and the error rate can be reduced, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of software development and operation and maintenance.
