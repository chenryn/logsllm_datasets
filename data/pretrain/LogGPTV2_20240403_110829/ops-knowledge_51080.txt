User: I have no idea why this happens and then it doesn't come up with any typing cursor even when I click so I can't edit anything. I'm running Windows 10, and Python 3.4.4. Anyone know why this is happening?

Cannon update File menu Recent Files list. Your operating system says:
[Errno 13] Permission denied:
'C:\Users\Aaron\.idlerc\recent-files.lst'

Solved, my .idlerc folder was hidden, after making it visible everything worked fine.
Assistant: If the recent-files.lst file is hidden, Python will fail to access it properly. You most likely tried to hide the .idlerc folder and applied the same settings to any subfolders. You can still keep that folder hidden, because it's ugly, but make sure not to set the recent-files.lst file to hidden, too.
