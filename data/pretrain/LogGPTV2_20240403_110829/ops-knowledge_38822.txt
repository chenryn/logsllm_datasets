User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why do inflight wifi networks display a captcha? When you log on to Gogo Inflight Wifi or similar, Gogo displays a captcha:



A CAPTCHA is usually associated with preventing automated traffic from accessing your network; however, to connect to Gogo you need to be on the plane, thirty thousand feet in the air. It doesn't seem like this is exploitable by bots (or what the advantage would be from doing so).

What am I missing?

Assistant: I suspect this is to prevent inadvertient activation of service.

Imagine you have bougt a one-hour pass to use at a later time. When you start up your computer, your computer might try to update its antivirus, or may try to download some windows updates, thus prematurely starting your one-hour pass when you dont want.

Thus, they have a captcha to activate a pass (regardless of its a pre-purchased pass in your account or a pass that you purchase on the spot) just so you don't inadvertly activate the pass without your consent.

For example, look at these roaming "accidents", where a phone in the background, decides to download a software update or whatever, causing bills long above € 10 000, without the consent of the end user.
Thats why EU have done legalisation in the whole EU requiring all operators to require confirm each € 500, eg for each € 500 spent, the account must be blocked and require re-confirm to start billing again.

A captcha is not only to prevent "bots", its also used to make it clear you are doing a sensitive action, for example lets say deleting some important files, some software might ask you to type "Yes, I really want to delete this file!" in a text box or just ask to "enter 4252562 to delete the file".
To prevent auto-complete from kicking in, it can be good idea to use captcha or whatever.

So this captcha is more as a "confirm activation of pass" so you can't come and complain after this like "wtf? My pass is gone and I haven't activated it" (but in the background some software on your computer activated it). Its a service from the Company to you as a customer.
