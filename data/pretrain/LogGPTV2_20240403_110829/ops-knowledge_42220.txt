User: How to do version control in continuous integration and continuous deployment?
Assistant: In continuous integration and continuous deployment, version control is very important because it ensures the stability and reliability of the code. Here are some best practices for version control: 1. Use a version control tool: Using a version control tool like Git or SVN allows you to easily track and manage your code base. 2. Create a branch: By creating a branch, changes and improvements can be made to the code before testing it on the main branch. 3. Merge code: When your team finishes making changes and improvements to the code, and the test code is placed in the main branch, you need to merge the code. 4. Version tagging: Version tagging is very useful when making important changes or releasing new versions. This way, you can easily track its history and improvements. In summary, version control is very important for code management in continuous integration and continuous deployment. It ensures multi-person collaboration and code reliability without creating unnecessary issues for the deployment and delivery process.
