User: How to create and use Git branches to manage software development?
Assistant: The steps to create and use Git branches to manage software development are as follows: 1. Create a branch: Use the command `git branch <branch_name>` to create a new branch (branch_name is the branch name), which will be the same as the current branch. 2. Switch branch: Use the command `git checkout <branch_name>` to switch to the newly created branch. 3. Develop new functions or modify code: develop or modify code on a new branch. 4. Submit the code: Use the command `git add .` to add all the modified code to the temporary storage area, and then use the command `git commit -m "<commit_message>"` to submit the modified code to the local warehouse (commit_message is the comment for the submission ). 5. Merge branch: Use the command `git checkout <merge_to_branch>` to switch to the branch to be merged (merge_to_branch is the target branch). Then use the command `git merge <merge_from_branch>` to merge other branches (merge_from_branch is the branch to be merged) into the target branch. 6. Resolve conflicts: If conflicts occur when branches are merged, use the command `git mergetool` or manually edit files to resolve conflicts. 7. Push to the remote warehouse: Use the command `git push origin <branch_name>` to push the local branch to the remote warehouse (branch_name is the name of the local branch). Using Git branches to manage software development can allow developers to collaborate better, avoid direct modification on the main branch, reduce code conflicts, and enhance code maintainability and scalability.
