ABSTRACT 
The  speaker  will  utilize  his  experience  from  inside  one  of  the 
world's  largest  social  networks  during  the  2016  and  2018 
elections, and running an election integrity war room in 2020 to 
discuss the ways that technology fails the people we try so hard 
to serve. We will discuss the realistic assumptions we can make 
about threats, and the expectations we should have of users, and 
try  to  chart  a  path  forward  for  how  cutting-edge  security 
research  might  better 
inform  the  engineers  and  product 
designers  who  end  up  putting  computing  technologies  in  the 
hands of billions.
