User: Often when I am coding I just like to print little things (mostly the current value of variables) out to console. I don't see anything like this for Google App Engine, although I note that the Google App Engine Launcher does have a Log terminal. Is there any way to write to said Terminal, or to some other terminal, using Google App Engine?
Assistant: Use log.setLevel(Level.ALL) to see messages
The default message filtering level seems to be 'error'.  I didn't see any useful log messages until I used the setLevel() method to make the .info and .warning messages visible. 
Text printed to System.out wasn't showing up either.  It seems to be interpreted as log.info() level messaages.
