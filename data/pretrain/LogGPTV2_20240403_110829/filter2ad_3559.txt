### Background

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) provide a suite of valuable analytical and decision-making techniques that are increasingly being adopted by a broad community of practitioners, including those working on security-sensitive applications. However, there is a notable gap in the interaction between the AI/ML and security research communities. Security researchers often treat AI/ML components as black-box solvers, while AI/ML researchers rarely consider the security and privacy implications of their algorithms during the design phase. This lack of cross-disciplinary attention has led to the emergence of a new research area known as secure learning, which focuses on the intersection of these two fields.

The AISec workshop has become the primary venue for this unique fusion of research, addressing the challenges and opportunities at the intersection of AI, ML, and security. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in activity within the AISec/secure learning community, driven by several factors:

1. **Big Data Analytics:** AI and ML technologies play a crucial role in extracting knowledge, situational awareness, and security intelligence from large datasets.
2. **Industry Adoption:** Major companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Splunk are increasingly exploring and deploying learning technologies to solve Big Data problems for their customers.
3. **Exposure to Intelligent Technologies:** These trends are exposing both companies and their users to intelligent technologies, leading to both potential solutions and new vulnerabilities in the realm of security and privacy.

The AISec Workshop serves as the only long-running venue dedicated to this topic, providing a platform for researchers to explore both the potential and the risks associated with AI and ML in security and privacy.
