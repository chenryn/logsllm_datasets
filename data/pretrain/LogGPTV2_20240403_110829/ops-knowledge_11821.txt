User: I have installed tensorflow on Windows using Docker, I want to go to the folder "tensorflow/models/image/imagenet" that contains "classify_image.py" python file..
Can someone please how to reach this mentioned path?
Assistant: If you're using one of the devel tags (:latest-devel or :latest-devel-gpu), the file should be in /tensorflow/tensorflow/models/image/imagenet/classify_image.py.
If you're using the base container (b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest), it's not included -- that image just has the binary installed, not a full source distribution, and classify_image.py isn't included in the binary distribution.
