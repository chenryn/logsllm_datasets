ABSTRACT
We consider reliable telemetry in white spaces in the form of pro-
tecting the integrity of distributed spectrum measurements against
coordinated misreporting attacks. Our focus is on the case where a
subset of the sensors can be remotely attested. We propose a prac-
tical framework for using statistical sequential estimation coupled
with machine learning classiﬁers to deter attacks and achieve quan-
tiﬁably precise outcome. We provide an application-oriented case
study in the context of spectrum measurements in the white spaces.
The study includes a cost analysis for remote attestation, as well as
an evaluation using real transmitter and terrain data from the FCC
and NASA for Southwest Pennsylvania. The results show that with
as low as 15% penetration of attestation-capable nodes, more than
94% of the attempts from omniscient attackers can be thwarted.

INTRODUCTION
Dynamic spectrum allocation promises to make spectrum use
more efﬁcient by enabling opportunistic, unlicensed (secondary)
use of ‘white-space’ frequencies when they are not occupied by li-
censed (primary) users. This paradigm has gained signiﬁcant trac-
tion due to the increasing demand for wireless services, the limited
availability of spectrum, and the FCC’s recent ruling that permits
operation of unlicensed users in the unused portions of the TV spec-
trum. This permission is considered the ﬁrst signiﬁcant increase in
unlicensed spectrum below 5 GHz in over 20 years [2].
Identifying unused portions of spectrum is a key requirement for
opportunistic spectrum access. Spectrum availability data is envi-
sioned to be centrally aggregated and consulted to govern the us-
age of spectrum. At least three scenarios for data collection have
been proposed. First, the data may be provided by volunteer white-
space devices or deployed sensors to build regional or nationwide
spectrum availability databases, or augment the white space geo-
location database mandated by the FCC. Second, a white-space
service provider may collect spectrum sensing data from white-
space devices in its network to determine areas of primary pres-
ence [1, 4, 11]. Third, by combining spectrum sensing data from
multiple devices (collaborative sensing), one can improve the de-
tection accuracy in highly shadowed environments [37].

Reliable Telemetry, or reliable central aggregation of sensor data
in this context, is threatened by nodes that may report false data
with malicious intent. A coordinated group of attacker nodes may
aim to exploit a spectrum in a given region by falsely reporting that
a primary signal is present, or vandalize a primary by reporting that
its signal is not present and thereby creating interference and chaos.
Previous works on this problem have achieved moderate degrees of
success by identifying the data from individual or small groups of
attackers as abnormal. These approaches suffer from at least two
shortcomings. First, their effectiveness is limited by relying solely
on sensor data for inferring (dis)trust. Second, they assume limits
on the penetration of attackers in an area; attackers either constitute
a small fraction of nodes in a small local neighborhood [30], or if
they control the majority of nodes in a neighborhood, the prepon-
derance of adjacent neighborhoods must be un-compromised [18].
In this paper, we initiate a new direction in reliable distributed
measurement by relying on a small subset of nodes that can perform
remote attestation. These nodes can securely attest their operating
state to a remote server. They will be excluded if they are detected
as compromised. Otherwise, they will be used as a foundation for
security and reliability. To that end, we propose a practical frame-
work for using data from both attested and regular nodes to deter
attacks, while achieving quantiﬁably accurate results in the absence
of attacks. More speciﬁcally, we explore a strategy based on sta-
tistical sequential sampling and inference to obtain an estimate for
signal power in each small region. The sampling method uses data
from all of the attested nodes, as well as the minimum required data
from the rest of the nodes to achieve accuracy with a pre-speciﬁed
margin of error. Next, the data contributed by non-attested nodes is
veriﬁed against data from attested nodes in the neighboring areas.
This step is performed using SVM classiﬁers with quadratic ker-
nels that are trained with an initial set of trusted signal propagation
data in the region of interest.
We evaluate our scheme using predicted signal power data ob-
tained from applying empirical signal propagation data to real-world
TV transmitter and terrain data from the FCC and NASA databases.
We instantiate the evaluations to a hilly urban/suburban area in
Pennsylvania and measure the performance of our approach in the
absence and presence of omniscient coordinated attackers. In addi-
tion, we systematically enumerate the costs associated with remote
attestation and provide detailed data on these costs for prototypes
based on Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and AVR32 microcon-
trollers. The data shows attestation may introduce non-trivial costs,
which motivates our approach to leveraging attestation efﬁciently
to establish trust in spectrum sensing results. Our evaluation re-
sults show that our scheme is highly effective against attacks even
in cases where only a small subset of the sensors can be remotely
attested. For example, with as low as 15% of nodes being attested,
we show that more than 94% of the attacks can be defended against.
The protection gradually improves as the fraction of attested nodes
increases.
The contributions of this paper are summarized below:
• A new direction in reliable telemetry against coordinated mis-
reporting attacks that relies on a small subset of attestation-
capable sensors.
• A practical framework for using statistical sequential esti-
mation coupled with machine learning classiﬁers to deter at-
tacks and achieve quantiﬁably accurate outcome.
• A case study based on real TV transmitter and terrain data
from the FCC and NASA in Pennsylvania that includes an
evaluation for the proposed scheme, as well as a cost analysis
for remote attestation.
2. BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM FORMU-
LATION
In this section we ﬁrst provide background information on spec-
trum measurements and remote attestation. Next, we describe our
setting and problem statement.
2.1 Spectrum Sensing and Aggregation in White
Spaces
The FCC’s ruling in November 2008 allows for operation of
unlicensed users in the unused portions of the TV spectrum [2].
Wireless communications in this spectrum (below 700 MHz) ben-
eﬁt from favorable signal propagation and penetration properties,
which enable long transmission ranges. Access to this spectrum
could enable more powerful Internet connections in public areas,
campuses, and homes with extended range, fewer dead spots, and
improved speeds. Many other applications are envisioned; for ex-
ample, broadband access for rural areas, extended access to medi-
cal care in rural areas, and support for the communications of the
advanced meter infrastructure (AMI) [3, 17].
Sensing the spectrum to identify unused channels can be used to
improve the performance of white space networks. This is despite
the FCC’s September 2010 ruling which exempts the devices that
incorporate geo-location and can access a new TV band database
from mandatory spectrum sensing [3]: (1) The ruling still allows
for operation of sensing-only devices that cannot or do not access
the database. (2) The database is built from conservative propaga-
tion models, which results in declaring many unused channels as
occupied in places far from the transmitters. Real-time spectrum
sensing data can provide a more accurate view of spectrum avail-
ability, or be used to improve the database results. (3) In places
where multiple channels are available, the spectrum sensing details
can reveal the highest quality channels for communications.
There exist three scenarios for centrally aggregating spectrum
sensing results from sensors in a large region [19]. First, using
data from deployed spectrum sensors or volunteer (mobile) white-
space devices to build a regional or nationwide spectrum availabil-
ity database. Such a database can be used to augment the white
space geo-location database mandated by the FCC, or to learn spec-
trum usage as part of the recently passed Spectrum Inventory Bill [6].
Second, a white-space service provider or base station may col-
lect spectrum sensing data to determine areas of primary presence
from cognitive radios in its network. This centralized approach
has been endorsed by the IEEE 802.22 WRAN standard draft [4],
CogNeA [1] and recent research prototypes [11]. The spectrum
sensing data collected by the service provider may be provided by
not only in-network cognitive radios, but also deployed spectrum
sensors, and additional volunteer (mobile) devices to determine ar-
eas of primary presence. Third, spectrum sensing results from mul-
tiple devices may be combined to improve the detection accuracy
at low thresholds in highly shadowed environments [37].
To capture the common aspects of the above scenarios, we focus
on the case of building a regional spectrum availability database
by a service provider. The database may then be combined with
databases from other regions to form a nationwide database of spec-
trum sensing. The spectrum sensing data used to populate the
database is provided by one or more of the following sources.
• Volunteer Radios: a set of (mobile) devices with different
owners. The data would be collected by a modern ‘mobile
app’ built to perform spectrum sensing at its current location
and report the results to a central server. This form of partic-
ipatory sensing is also referred to as crowdsourcing.
• In-Network Cognitive Radios: cognitive radios that are part
of the service provider’s network.
• Dedicated Sensors: sensors (in the form of a wireless sensor
network) deployed for the speciﬁc task of spectrum sensing
alongside the main white-space network [16].
2.2 Remote Attestation
Remote attestation is a technique for a system to provide certi-
ﬁed information about its operating state (i.e. software, ﬁrmware,
or conﬁguration) to a remote party. This process is typically ini-
tiated by a request from the remote party. Upon receipt of the re-
quest, the queried system creates a (signed) record of the system’s
operating state and sends it to the initiator. To securely record and
certify its current state, the system needs to contain a number of
components. Trusted hardware components are often used to this
end, although software can also be used in some cases. Regardless,
remote attestation imposes additional computational, storage, en-
ergy, time, and potentially manufacturing costs on both parties. On
desktop PCs, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is often used to
provide remote attestation functionality. The Trusted Computing
Group (TCG) is developing trusted computing standards speciﬁ-
cally for mobile devices to minimize costs and support appropri-
ate usage models, and have speciﬁed several primitives for a Mo-
bile Trusted Module (MTM). MTMs are expected to be available
for many new mobile applications in the near future [7]. Previ-
ous work has also shown that remote attestation can feasibly be
implemented in software on-chip for embedded processors such as
AVR32 micro-controllers [25].
2.3 Setting and Problem Statement
We consider building a spectrum availability database from re-
ceived signal power data from a combination of volunteer radios,
in-network cognitive radios, and deployed sensors. We refer to
these sources as nodes or sensors in the rest of this paper. Due
to their widespread adoption, ease of implementation, and small
sensing time, we assume that energy detectors will be the only sen-
sors in use [8, 36]. We also assume the primary signal faces path
loss and shadow fading due to irregular terrain and obstacles such
as trees, buildings, walls, and windows.
The spectrum availability database represents the region of inter-
est as a grid of small cells (or tiles) on the map of the region. Each
cell may be a 1km × 1km square and is the unit in which combin-
ing individual results, or collaborative sensing, occurs. Within a
cell, we combine the raw signal power measurements from nodes to
determine primary presence (as opposed to binary yes/no results).
This allows for using signal power as a measure of quality among
the available channels and enables us to detect misreporting attacks.
A common method for combining sensing results within each cell
is Equal Gain Combining (EGC), which periodically averages the
power measurements of individual nodes in each frequency channel
and compares it to a detection threshold λ. In the case of primary
Digital TV (DTV) transmitters, FCC has mandated -114 dBm as
the detection threshold.
We address the problem of performing reliable aggregation of
spectrum measurement data contributed by a distributed set of nodes.
An attacker may compromise a (large) subset of the nodes and
make them act in cooperation in order to change the spectrum sens-
ing outcome in any cell, including any number of adjacent cells.
For example, they may seek to change the perceived primary signal
power for a cell from a value below threshold (-120 dBm) to a value
above threshold (-100 dBm), or vice versa. The ﬁrst attack is called
exploitation, and the second is called vandalism. In exploitation,
the attackers aim to deceive the network to abandon the channel to
exclusively use it for themselves, whereas in vandalism the main
goal is creating chaos or interference. We focus on canceling the
effect of such attackers that have a strong (e.g. majority) presence
in a cell, and (in the absence of any defense) are able to dominate
the cell and ﬂip the detection outcome.
A particularly novel aspect of our work is that we assume that a
subset of nodes, for example 20%, are able to perform remote at-
testation (see Figure 1). For any such attestation-capable node, the
aggregation server can detect whether it is compromised and thus
running illegitimate code. The question that we aim to answer is
how to efﬁciently and effectively use this capability to obtain reli-
able spectrum sensing results. This question is particularly impor-
tant when the attestation-capable nodes constitute a small fraction
of the nodes. This may be due to the low penetration of the technol-
ogy among the volunteer nodes, or cost considerations of deploying
and using this capability by the service providers in the deployed
sensor scenarios (see Section 5).
While some of the nodes may be unreliable or compromised in-
siders, we assume that each node maintains a secure link to the
base station for sending spectrum sensing results, and that attack-
ers are unable to fabricate nodes or identities arbitrarily (‘Sybil’ at-
tacks [32]). The secure links can be realized using pre-shared keys
or a PKI, which may also serve as a foundation for preventing Sybil
attacks by being associated with the identity of each node. Alter-
natively, one can take the dual view that we aim to demonstrate
a method that forces adversaries to discover and deploy a practi-
cal Sybil attack, which requires a higher level of sophistication on
the attacker’s side (e.g. faking multiple link layer addresses). We
also assume that the locations of nodes are reliably known through
GPS or other localization techniques and nodes do not misreport
their locations. This assumption is easily achievable in two of
the most popular proposed applications of white space network-
