## Abstract
We address the challenge of ensuring reliable telemetry in white spaces by protecting the integrity of distributed spectrum measurements against coordinated misreporting attacks. Our approach focuses on a subset of sensors that can be remotely attested. We propose a practical framework that combines statistical sequential estimation with machine learning classifiers to deter attacks and achieve quantifiably precise outcomes. This paper includes a case study in the context of spectrum measurements in white spaces, featuring a cost analysis for remote attestation and an evaluation using real transmitter and terrain data from the FCC and NASA for Southwest Pennsylvania. The results show that with as low as 15% penetration of attestation-capable nodes, more than 94% of attempts by omniscient attackers can be thwarted.

## 1. Introduction
Dynamic spectrum allocation aims to enhance spectrum efficiency by enabling opportunistic, unlicensed (secondary) use of 'white-space' frequencies when they are not occupied by licensed (primary) users. This paradigm has gained significant traction due to the increasing demand for wireless services, limited spectrum availability, and the FCC's recent ruling permitting unlicensed users to operate in unused portions of the TV spectrum. This permission marks the first significant increase in unlicensed spectrum below 5 GHz in over 20 years [2].

Identifying unused portions of the spectrum is crucial for opportunistic spectrum access. Spectrum availability data is typically centrally aggregated and used to manage spectrum usage. Three primary scenarios for data collection have been proposed:
1. Data provided by volunteer white-space devices or deployed sensors to build regional or nationwide spectrum availability databases, or to augment the white space geolocation database mandated by the FCC.
2. A white-space service provider collecting spectrum sensing data from white-space devices in its network to determine areas of primary presence [1, 4, 11].
3. Combining spectrum sensing data from multiple devices (collaborative sensing) to improve detection accuracy in highly shadowed environments [37].

Reliable telemetry, or the central aggregation of sensor data, is threatened by nodes that may report false data with malicious intent. Coordinated groups of attacker nodes may falsely report the presence or absence of primary signals to exploit the spectrum or cause interference. Previous approaches to this problem have had limited success, primarily because they rely solely on sensor data for inferring (dis)trust and assume limits on the number of compromised nodes.

In this paper, we introduce a new direction in reliable distributed measurement by leveraging a small subset of nodes capable of performing remote attestation. These nodes can securely attest their operating state to a remote server and will be excluded if detected as compromised. Otherwise, they serve as a foundation for security and reliability. We propose a practical framework that uses data from both attested and regular nodes to deter attacks while achieving quantifiably accurate results in the absence of attacks. Specifically, we employ statistical sequential sampling and inference to estimate signal power in each small region, and verify data from non-attested nodes against data from attested nodes using SVM classifiers with quadratic kernels.

We evaluate our scheme using predicted signal power data obtained from applying empirical signal propagation data to real-world TV transmitter and terrain data from the FCC and NASA databases. Our evaluations, conducted in a hilly urban/suburban area in Pennsylvania, demonstrate that our approach is highly effective against attacks, even with a small subset of attested nodes. For example, with as low as 15% of nodes being attested, more than 94% of attacks can be defended against. The protection improves as the fraction of attested nodes increases.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
- A new direction in reliable telemetry against coordinated misreporting attacks that leverages a small subset of attestation-capable sensors.
- A practical framework combining statistical sequential estimation with machine learning classifiers to deter attacks and achieve quantifiably accurate outcomes.
- A case study based on real TV transmitter and terrain data from the FCC and NASA in Pennsylvania, including an evaluation of the proposed scheme and a cost analysis for remote attestation.

## 2. Background and Problem Formulation
### 2.1 Spectrum Sensing and Aggregation in White Spaces
The FCC's ruling in November 2008 allows unlicensed users to operate in the unused portions of the TV spectrum [2]. Wireless communications in this spectrum (below 700 MHz) benefit from favorable signal propagation and penetration properties, enabling long transmission ranges. Access to this spectrum could support more powerful Internet connections in public areas, campuses, and homes, with extended range, fewer dead spots, and improved speeds. Other applications include broadband access for rural areas, extended medical care, and support for advanced meter infrastructure (AMI) [3, 17].

Spectrum sensing is essential for identifying unused channels and improving the performance of white space networks. Despite the FCC's September 2010 ruling, which exempts devices incorporating geo-location from mandatory spectrum sensing, real-time spectrum sensing data provides a more accurate view of spectrum availability and can be used to improve the database results [3]. In places with multiple available channels, spectrum sensing details can reveal the highest quality channels for communication.

Three scenarios for centrally aggregating spectrum sensing results from sensors in a large region have been proposed [19]:
1. Using data from deployed spectrum sensors or volunteer (mobile) white-space devices to build a regional or nationwide spectrum availability database, which can augment the white space geolocation database mandated by the FCC or support the recently passed Spectrum Inventory Bill [6].
2. A white-space service provider or base station collecting spectrum sensing data to determine areas of primary presence from cognitive radios in its network, endorsed by the IEEE 802.22 WRAN standard draft [4], CogNeA [1], and recent research prototypes [11].
3. Combining spectrum sensing results from multiple devices to improve detection accuracy in highly shadowed environments [37].

To capture the common aspects of these scenarios, we focus on building a regional spectrum availability database by a service provider. The database may be combined with databases from other regions to form a nationwide database of spectrum sensing. The data used to populate the database comes from one or more of the following sources:
- Volunteer Radios: mobile devices with different owners, reporting spectrum sensing results to a central server.
- In-Network Cognitive Radios: cognitive radios part of the service provider’s network.
- Dedicated Sensors: sensors deployed specifically for spectrum sensing alongside the main white-space network [16].

### 2.2 Remote Attestation
Remote attestation is a technique for a system to provide certified information about its operating state (software, firmware, or configuration) to a remote party. This process is typically initiated by a request from the remote party. Upon receipt, the queried system creates a signed record of its operating state and sends it to the initiator. Trusted hardware components, such as the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on desktop PCs, are often used to securely record and certify the current state. The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) is developing standards for mobile devices, including primitives for a Mobile Trusted Module (MTM), which are expected to be widely available in the near future [7]. Previous work has shown that remote attestation can be feasibly implemented in software on-chip for embedded processors like AVR32 micro-controllers [25].

### 2.3 Setting and Problem Statement
We consider building a spectrum availability database from received signal power data from a combination of volunteer radios, in-network cognitive radios, and deployed sensors, referred to as nodes or sensors. We assume energy detectors will be the only sensors in use due to their widespread adoption, ease of implementation, and short sensing time [8, 36]. We also assume the primary signal faces path loss and shadow fading due to irregular terrain and obstacles such as trees, buildings, walls, and windows.

The spectrum availability database represents the region of interest as a grid of small cells (or tiles) on the map. Each cell, typically a 1km × 1km square, is the unit for combining individual results or collaborative sensing. Within a cell, we combine raw signal power measurements from nodes to determine primary presence. This allows us to use signal power as a measure of quality among available channels and detect misreporting attacks. A common method for combining sensing results within each cell is Equal Gain Combining (EGC), which periodically averages the power measurements of individual nodes in each frequency channel and compares it to a detection threshold (e.g., -114 dBm for DTV transmitters).

Our goal is to perform reliable aggregation of spectrum measurement data contributed by a distributed set of nodes. An attacker may compromise a (large) subset of the nodes and make them act in cooperation to change the spectrum sensing outcome in any cell, including adjacent cells. For example, they may seek to change the perceived primary signal power for a cell from below the threshold (-120 dBm) to above the threshold (-100 dBm), or vice versa. The first attack is called exploitation, and the second is called vandalism. In exploitation, the attackers aim to deceive the network to abandon the channel for exclusive use, whereas in vandalism, the goal is to create chaos or interference. We focus on canceling the effect of such attackers that have a strong (e.g., majority) presence in a cell and can dominate the cell and flip the detection outcome.

A novel aspect of our work is that we assume a subset of nodes, for example, 20%, can perform remote attestation (see Figure 1). For any such attestation-capable node, the aggregation server can detect whether it is compromised and running illegitimate code. The key question is how to efficiently and effectively use this capability to obtain reliable spectrum sensing results, especially when the attestation-capable nodes constitute a small fraction of the nodes. This may be due to the low penetration of the technology among volunteer nodes or cost considerations for deploying and using this capability by service providers.

While some nodes may be unreliable or compromised, we assume each node maintains a secure link to the base station for sending spectrum sensing results, and attackers are unable to fabricate nodes or identities arbitrarily (Sybil attacks [32]). Secure links can be realized using pre-shared keys or a PKI, which can also prevent Sybil attacks by associating with the identity of each node. Alternatively, we aim to demonstrate a method that forces adversaries to deploy a practical Sybil attack, requiring a higher level of sophistication. We also assume that the locations of nodes are reliably known through GPS or other localization techniques and that nodes do not misreport their locations. This assumption is easily achievable in two of the most popular proposed applications of white space networks.
