    function handleWindowBeforeunload(event) {
        const confirmed = (dialog.showMessageBox(remote.getCurrentWindow(), options) === 1);
        if (confirmed) {
            remote.getCurrentWindow().close();
        } else {
            event.returnValue = false;
        }
    }
    window.addEventListener("beforeunload", handleWindowBeforeunload);
### Expected behavior
The window should stay open except when button 1 is pressed in the message
box.
### Actual behavior
Sometimes (~1 out of 10 times) the window will close, regardless of the button
pressed in the message box.  
It happens more often when the developer tools are closed, and never happens
when using the debugger to step over the code.
### How to reproduce
Use the code snipped above with any message box with >= 2 buttons, with closed
developer tools.
The code above is loosely modeled in the way atom does their beforeunload
handling.
