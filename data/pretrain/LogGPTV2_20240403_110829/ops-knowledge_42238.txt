User: If I have a python file that has no suffix.  Can pydev read that file as a python file using the first line of the file if it includes a #!/usr/bin/python?  I'm not really concerned specifically about using that first line, just that that line exists and might be useable.  If there is a manual way to mark a file as a python file without mucking with its suffix that'd be fine as well.
Assistant: Just right-click on the file, then hit "Open With" -> "Other", then choose "Python editor" and hit OK. Eclipse will remember your choice and from then on will open that particular file in the Python editor when you double-click it.
