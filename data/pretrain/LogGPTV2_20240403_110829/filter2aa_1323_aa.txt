Summary 
Motorola supports the FCC’s general approach to promote use of the TV broadcast bands 
by unlicensed devices on most of the spectrum occupied by channels below TV channel 52 
because it believes that reasonable technical rules can be developed to minimize interference to 
incumbent operations.  The spectrum made available as a result of the Commission’s action will 
be beneficial for a variety of commercial and non-commercial broadband services and is 
uniquely appropriate for service in rural areas.  Motorola believes, however, that the FCC should 
adopt policies that will enhance the usefulness and availability of this spectrum for devices and 
applications that meet the needs of public safety agencies and other critical uses.  Such 
applications will serve as a useful supplement for mission critical systems operated in dedicated 
licensed spectrum allocations.   
Motorola appreciates and supports the Commission’s decision to prohibit portable 
unlicensed devices on TV channels 14-20 in order to protect public safety operations that share 
this spectrum in 13 markets across the country.  Because the interference impact to emergency 
responders could have disastrous consequences, Motorola agrees with the Commission’s 
fundamental view that unlicensed use of the 470-512 MHz band should not be allowed until the 
technology to ensure proper protection of incumbent public safety licensees has been fully 
developed, tested and proven.   
-ii- 
Motorola recommends, however, that the Commission consider allowing some limited 
and controlled use of the 470-512 MHz band by low powered devices in order for public safety 
and other critical users (and the industry that serves them) to gain more experience and 
understanding of the application of cognitive radio equipment in that environment.  More 
specifically, Motorola recommends that the Commission allow public safety agencies and other 
critical users to deploy fixed and personal/portable low power devices within the 470-512 MHz 
band that are consistent with the technical standards established in this proceeding on a 
nationwide basis.  As further experience with the technology is applied, the Commission can 
review whether these eligibility restrictions continue to be warranted.  
Such use of the 470-512 MHz band should be controlled and monitored.  Operations 
would not be unlicensed but would be authorized “by rule” in the same manner that the FCC 
authorizes police departments to use radiolocation speed determining devices (“radar guns”) 
without having to apply for a new license.  In order to protect incumbent land mobile uses in the 
470-512 MHz band, Motorola recommends the establishment of 145 kilometer exclusion zones 
around the 13 markets that use these frequencies for land mobile services.  This is only a modest 
expansion of the FCC’s initial proposal to adopt exclusion zones of 134 kilometers.   
In addition to establishing 470-512 MHz for public safety low powered devices, the 
Commission should also consider adopting priority access requirements for devices that operate 
in other portions of the TV spectrum to help ensure that public safety and other critical users 
have adequate spectrum capacity.  More specifically, Motorola recommends that public safety 
-iii- 
and other critical users be provided unconditional priority access to two VHF and two UHF 
channels from TV channels 7-25.  In addition, during emergency situations, public safety and 
other critical users should have the ability to preempt users on other channels with this range if 
necessary to meet critical communications requirements.   
Motorola previously stated that it is premature to rely on spectrum sensing as a spectrum 
access method because of the difficulties involved in implementing sensing technology in this 
environment and continues to recommend that database and location information should be the 
final source for determination on whether or not to transmit.  While Motorola believes that 
cognitive radios will inherently have sensing capabilities for determining which candidate 
channels provide the best communications opportunities, it is not clear at this time whether those 
capabilities can be used for independent identification and protection of licensed incumbents.

COMMENTS OF MOTOROLA, INC. 
On October 18, 2006, the Federal Communications Commission (“Commission” or 
“FCC”) released a First Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in the 
above-captioned proceeding that addresses the use of low-powered unlicensed devices to operate 
on vacant channels in the spectrum allocated for television broadcast service.1  Motorola, Inc. 
(“Motorola”) respectfully submits these comments in response to the issues raised in the Further 
Notice.   
In general, Motorola supports the Commission’s approach to promote use of the TV 
broadcast bands by unlicensed devices on most of the spectrum occupied by channels below 
channel 52 because of its belief that reasonable technical rules can be developed to minimize 
interference to incumbent operations.  The spectrum made available as a result of the 
Commission’s action will be beneficial for a variety of commercial and non-commercial

broadband services and is uniquely appropriate for service in rural areas.  Motorola believes, 
however, that the FCC should adopt policies that will enhance the usefulness and availability of 
this spectrum for devices and applications that meet the needs of public safety agencies and other 
critical uses.  Such applications will serve as a useful supplement for mission critical systems 
operated in dedicated licensed spectrum allocations.2

BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY. 
This proceeding was initiated to promote more efficient and effective use of the spectrum 
allocated for television broadcast service by allowing for the development and deployment of 
new types of unlicensed broadband devices and services for businesses and consumers.3  In 
developing its initial proposals, the Commission noted that there is significant bandwidth 
available in the TV bands because multiple 6 MHz wide channels are generally vacant or unused 
in any particular area.4  To ensure that no harmful interference to authorized users of the 
spectrum will occur, the Commission proposed to require that unlicensed devices operating on 
these vacant channels comply with significant restrictions and technical protections, including 
the incorporation of any number of a variety of “smart radio” or cognitive features to identify the 
vacant spectrum in the area where the unlicensed devices are located on a dynamic basis.5  With

Motorola emphasizes that although TV white space spectrum offers the potential to serve 
a variety of public safety and other critical use applications, its availability will not lessen the 
need for adequate spectrum allocations for licensed mission critical operations.

such protections, the Commission stated that unlicensed use of this spectrum could result in 
significant benefits for consumers and economic development for businesses by providing 
additional competition in the broadband market.6   
In its comments submitted in response to the initial Notice, Motorola agreed that it would 
be technically feasible to have low-power unlicensed devices share spectrum with incumbent 
broadcasters without causing harmful interference to TV reception.7  However, Motorola 
expressed concern about unlicensed operation in TV spectrum that is currently shared by 
commercial and public safety land mobile operations.  Motorola argued against unlicensed use of 
this shared spectrum until protection mechanisms that ensure interference-free unlicensed 
transmissions to mobile facilities are proven reliable.8  Specifically, Motorola recommended 
against permitting unlicensed operations on TV channels 14-20 (470-512 MHz) that are already 
available for shared used by public safety and other critical land mobile services and TV 
channels 52-69 (698-806 MHz) that have been reallocated to public safety, commercial wireless 
and band manager services. 
The First R&O adopted in October of 2006 focused on the larger policy issues addressed 
by the original Notice.  It adopted the general policy to allow the operation of fixed low power 
devices on most TV channels beginning on February 18, 2009, in areas where those frequencies

are not being used for TV or other incumbent licensed services.9  Exempted from this general 
decision were TV channel 37, which is used by radio astronomy and wireless medical telemetry 
devices, and the reallocated TV channels 52-69.  The First R&O did not allow any unlicensed 
operations (fixed or personal/portable) on these channels.  Further, consistent with Motorola’s 
recommendations, the First R&O prohibited the use of unlicensed personal/portable devices on 
TV channels 14-20 due to the difficulties of coordinating unlicensed use with mobile services.10   
The Further Notice was adopted concurrently with the First R&O.  In this phase of this 
proceeding, the Commission seeks additional technical analyses to determine the answers to the 
following fundamental questions:   
1) 
Can personal/portable devices operate in the TV broadcast band without 
causing harmful interference?11 
2) 
Should fixed unlicensed devices be permitted to operate on TV Channels 
14-20 in the 13 cities where these channels are used by public safety and 
other mobile services?12 
3) 
Should low power devices authorized to operate in the TV band be 
permitted only on a licensed, rather than an unlicensed, basis or should 
there be a hybrid licensing scheme?13   
The Further Notice also requests further comment on the methods that low power devices 
may use to determine whether a portion of the TV band is unused at a specific time and location.  
Specifically, the Commission seeks additional comment on the technical viability of the

following three methods while offering specific technical proposals to implement these 
techniques: 
Spectrum Sensing Approach:  An unlicensed device could have sensing capabilities 
incorporated into its equipment to detect whether other transmitters are operating in an 
area. 14 
Geo-location/Database Approach:  The location of an unlicensed device is established 
by a professional installer or by the device itself using geo-location technology such as 
GPS incorporated within the device.  It could then be determined from either a local 
internal or remote external database whether the unlicensed device is located far enough 
outside the protected service contours of licensed television stations to avoid causing 
harmful interference.15 
Control Signal Approach:  An unlicensed device could receive information transmitted 
from an external source such as a broadcast station or another unlicensed transmitter 
indicating which channels are available at its geographic location.16 
Motorola supports the Commission’s efforts to expand the effective use of the TV 
broadcast spectrum by promoting the deployment of unlicensed and/or registered devices that are 
capable of operating on a non-interfering basis.  The success of this policy, however, is 
dependent on the development and performance of spectrum access methods that help ensure 
that unlicensed devices operate only where protected incumbent facilities are not located.  In this 
regard, Motorola has been actively participating in the leading IEEE cognitive radio and 
coexistence standardization venues including IEEE 802.22, IEEE P1900 and the SDR Forum.17

The IEEE 802.22 working group of the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards committee is 
formally developing “Standard for Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRAN) - Specific 
requirements - Part 22: Cognitive Wireless RAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical 
Layer (PHY) Specifications: Policies and procedures for operation in the TV Bands” and focuses

In IEEE 802.22, Motorola has been instrumental in the drafting of the 802.22 baseline 
standard for fixed point to multipoint wireless broadband access in the TV white space.  
Motorola is also taking a leading role in the discussions in IEEE 802.22.1, a Task Group of IEEE 
802.22, to draft a disabling beacon standard that offers enhanced protection to licensed and 
protected devices and services.  To proactively address the critical need for proper, professional 
installation of fixed access base stations, Motorola participates as the vice-chair of Task Group 
IEEE 802.22.2, established to create a Recommended Practice for installation of TV white space 
devices.  In IEEE P1900, Motorola chairs the Task Group work that is developing methods and 
standards for the use of cognitive radio technology to select from among many standards 
available on a multi frequency, multimode wireless network.  In the SDR Forum, Motorola holds 
leadership positions in the development of software defined radio technologies for advanced 
radio technologies.  Motorola believes that the diverse standards venues are needed to solve the 
myriad of complex technological issues to make innovative services in the TV white space a 
reality.

2005 jointly by the IEEE Communications Society and the IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility 
Society.  The objective is to develop supporting standards dealing with new technologies and 
techniques being developed for next generation radio and advanced spectrum management.  The 
Software Defined Radio (SDR) Forum is a non-profit organization comprised of approximately 
100 corporations from around the globe dedicated to promoting the development, deployment 
and use of software defined radio technologies for advanced wireless systems.

In these comments, Motorola augments its previously filed comments in this proceeding 
including updated analysis and recommendations on each of the spectrum access methods 
discussed in the Further Notice.  Motorola intends to provide additional information to the FCC 
as work in the various IEEE forums described above progresses.   
Motorola believes that the TV white space spectrum will be valuable for a variety of both 
commercial and non-commercial uses and that the ability to use this spectrum for unlicensed and 
registered devices while fully protecting services with higher regulatory priority will advance 
and improve over time.  At this nascent stage of development, however, Motorola believes that it 
is appropriate for the Commission to proceed with some caution so that future opportunities are 
not diminished by haphazard early deployments.   
Motorola recommends that the Commission adopt special provisions that would enhance 
the utility of TV white space spectrum for use by public safety and other critical users.  For 
example, until the capabilities of spectrum access methods are fully proven, the Commission 
should limit the availability of TV white space on channels 14-20 to public safety and other
