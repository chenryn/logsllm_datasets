 **Neo4j version** : 4.1.1 (community edition)  
**Operating system** : DEBIAN 7  
**API/Driver** : Cypher/Python API/Browser/Desktop (I get the same error
everywhere)
**Steps to reproduce** : I created several csv files to run `neo4j-admin
import`. I can't share the files unfortunately. The import runs successfully
without errors. In the graph there are: 8 different node labels, 3
relationship types, 700k nodes, 400M relationships. **There's a specific
relationship csv file (7 GB), containing 399M relationships out of the total
~400M, which leads to this issue. If I don't include that file, everything
works fine.**
When I operate a simple query e.g.  
`match path = (h)-[r]->(t) where (('Gene' in labels(h)) and ('Gene' in
labels(t))) or (('Gene' in labels(h)) and ('Variant' in labels(t))) return
id(h), id(t)`
I obtain the following error:
`NOT PART OF CHAIN! RelationshipTraversalCursor[id=292159681, open state with:
denseNode=true, next=292159681, , underlying
record=Relationship[292159681,used=true,source=137047,target=271310,type=0,sPrev=292159682,sNext=292159680,tPrev=292196972,tNext=292152117,prop=295162289,!sFirst,!tFirst]]`
I also run a consistency check and obtained:

Can someone please explain what this means? Does it imply something goes wrong
in the import?  
If yes, I'd expect an error message in the import process.
