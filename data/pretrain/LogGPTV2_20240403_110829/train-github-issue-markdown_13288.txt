I experienced weird response when it comes to FMA on Julia 1.4 .
First started Julia from the command line, without any flags (downloaded from
julialang.org). Then I checked `mulladd` with code_native and find it's not
using FMA CPU instructions and `Base.Math.FMA_NATIVE` also showed false...
that was strange since as long as I've used julia this was always true and FMA
always used native instruction.
Then I started Julia with `-O3`. Check thing again... `muladd` is correctly
using native FMA, but `Base.Math.FMA_NATIVE` is false (makes sense since it's
a precompile constant, but should be fixed regardless).
Then the strange behavior shows up. I then check julia again (without `-O3`
flag) and native FMA is working correctly in `muladd` (Base.Math.FMA_NATIVE
still false).
