sharing.
To obtain the energy consumption statistics on smartphones, we
tried many existing software solutions (e.g., Battery Historian [48],
Emmagee [49]). However, these methods either cannot provide
fine-grained time series or fail to read 5G signaling information.
On the other hand, the hardware solution, e.g., Monsoon Power
Monitor [59] typically used in 4G test, needs to remove the phone’s
battery, which is not feasible for our all-in-one 5G smartphones.
Therefore, we custom-build an energy consumption logging and
analysis tool, called pwrStrip by directly reading battery status
(time-stamp, instant current, voltage, etc) from the Android kernel,
at a fine-grained 100ms interval.
Following the above methodology, we perform extensive inves-
tigation over the 5G networks via both active and passive mea-
surements, which lead to a dataset of 2.1 TB (366.5 GB for analysis
after removing irrelevant payload) through 7 months. Leveraging
on such a first-of-its-kind measurement campaign, we conduct a
comprehensive and in-depth analysis to profile the current 5G net-
works. Moreover, we have publicly released our dataset along with
the measurement tools at GitHub [68], for facilitating in-depth 5G
exploration in our community.

easy deployment and low cost.
Our 5G network operates at 3.5 GHz frequency, also referred
to as New Radio (NR) or sub-6 GHz band (i.e. 0.45 GHz to 6 GHz)
following 3GPP Rel-15 TS 38.104 [8]. The alternative 5G millimeter-
wave (operating at a much higher frequency, i.e. 24.25 GHz to 52.6
GHz) has not been deployed by our local 5G operators, and hence it
is beyond the scope of this work. One may refer to recent work in
[60, 61] for a measurement study of 5G millimeter-wave networks.
In Sec. 8, we will provide more details on the 5G spectrum usage.
5G user equipment (UE). Our measurement involves three 5G
phone models: ZTE Axon10 Pro (Qualcomm Snapdragon TM855),
HUAWEI Mate20 X (Hisilicon Kirin 980) and HUAWEI Mate30
Pro (Mali G76 | Hisilicon Kirin 990). Unless otherwise mentioned,
we use Axon10 in most experiments. When we carried out our
measurement campaign, only a few 5G smartphone models are
available on the market. ZTE Axon10 Pro represents mainstream 5G
smartphones with powerful communication (SDX M50 5G modem),
computing (Snapdragon TM855) and storage (256 GB) capabilities.
Axon10 also adopts the mainstream Qualcomm chip-set, allowing
for a flexible diagnostic mode wherein certain PHY and MAC layer
information can be extracted, to enable the low-layer measurement.
We believe the computing and radio hardware profile of Axon10
represent the state-of-the-art, and the measurement findings hold
true for other 5G smartphone models, particularly for these with the
Qualcomm chip-set. In terms of network performance at TCP and
application level, the phone model does not matter much. We have
also used two HUAWEI 5G UEs to measure TCP and application
performance, which show consistent results.
Cloud server. We deploy some of our measurement tools (men-
tioned later) in a HUAWEI cloud server (8vCPUs | 64GB | Ubuntu
18.04) with 1000 Mbps bandwidth to match the 5G wireless bit-rate.
It is noteworthy that such a Gbps cloud service incurs a high cost
($36.43 per hour), which hints that 5G services, particularly the
bandwidth-hungry applications, may be too expensive for end-
users at this stage. The server is located in the same city with our
campus, and the geographical distance is about dozes of kilometers
(due to our communication with the could service technicians). In
addition, we utilize 20 SPEEDTEST [5] servers for end-to-end delay
measurement (Sec. 4.4), and they are located 1 km to 3400 km away,
as listed in Appendix C.

3 5G COVERAGE
We first perform a blanket measurement within the campus region,
and zoom in on the coverage of a single 5G gNB. We then study
the indoor-outdoor capacity gap and finally examine mobile hand-
off across cells. In all experiments, we contrast the 5G with its
counterpart 4G.
3.1 Campus Coverage
We traverse all road segments (6.019 km in total) within the cam-
pus region at a normal walking speed of about 4 - 5 km/h, while
carrying an XCAL-equipped laptop and a smartphone to monitor
the physical-layer information of both 5G and 4G. Meanwhile, we
use a GPS receiver on the laptop to record the sampling locations.
Through the blanket survey, we identify 6 5G gNBs on the campus.
Each gNB consists of 2 or 3 sectors (cells) facing towards different
directions, as marked with
in Fig. 2(a). For instance, the bottom-
right gNB has 3 cells with physical cell indicators 60, 61 and 62. The
gNB cells operate at 3.5 GHz carrier frequency with 100 MHz band-
width, in contrast to the 1.8 GHz carrier and 20 MHz bandwidth
in 4G. Tab. 1 summarizes the general physical layer profile of the
co-located 4G and 5G networks. Note that the RSRP (i.e., reference
signal received power) in Tab. 1 represents the average value across
all sampling points. According to 5G standard Rel-15 TS 38.104
[8], the 3.5 GHz frequency belongs to the n78 band, which uses
the TDD (Time Division Duplexing). In contrast, the 4G network
uses the b3 band with FDD, i.e., the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL)
channels use orthogonal frequencies.
2,
In addition, the 5G gNB density on our campus is 12.99/km
which is on a similar scale as the average density across our city’s
2) [20]. Therefore,
urban region (7000 eNBs in 667/km
we believe the campus coverage profile is representative.
2, i.e., 10.49/km
Despite the high deployment density, many coverage holes still
exist as marked by pink dots in Fig. 2(a). These are the areas
with the lowest level of RSRP [-140, -105] dBm, unable to initiate
communication services. According to Rel-15 TS 36.211 [10], if
the RSRP is less than -105 dBm, the communication service cannot
be triggered. We randomly sample 4630 locations, and summarize
the number of locations (and percentage) in each RSRP category
in Tab. 2. We observe that: (i) The fraction of 5G coverage holes is
non-negligible, i.e., 8.07% locations have RSRP lower than -105 dBm,
in contrast to only 1.77% for 4G. We find that a 5G gNB is always
co-sitting with a 4G eNB due to the NSA. However, not all 4G eNBs
have 5G companions, implying that the 5G deployment has not
fully matured yet. Overall, the 4G eNB density is much higher (13
2), which partly explains its better
base stations in total, 28.14/km
coverage. (ii) Even under the same deployment density (i.e., only
focusing on the 6 4G eNBs co-sitting with 5G counterparts), the
fraction of 4G coverage holes is only 3.84%, still much lower than
5G. This may be due to the higher carrier frequencies used by 5G,
and hence higher attenuation loss over the same distance. On the
other hand, it implies that, for both 4G and 5G, the deployment has
to be highly redundant to fix all the coverage holes. It is noteworthy
that we carry out the experiments under the scenario with the daily
human, bicycle, and vehicular traffic on campus. The coverage holes
exist consistently irrespective of such environment dynamics.
3.2 Cell Coverage
We now characterize the coverage profile around one typical 5G
gNB. We force the 5G phone to lock on a specific cell by turning
on the frequency-lock switch (PCI 72, 1850 MHz in our setting) in
the diagnostic mode. Notably, this is locking on the frequency of
the master 4G eNB, because under NSA, the RRC configuration
messages from the 5G UE must pass through the corresponding
master 4G eNB before reaching the 5G gNB. Afterward, we par-
2 grids and sample 154
tition the gNB’s nearby region into 20 m

locations across all the grids. The contour plot in Fig. 2 (b) connects
the sample locations with the same bit-rate. Our observations are as
follows: (i) The contour lines obviously deviate from the ideal sec-
tor/circle shape, mostly biased by building blockage and multi-path
reflections. (ii) To examine the impact of signal path-loss, we walk
along a line-of-signal (LoS) path between cell 72 and location A in
Fig. 2(b). We find that the 5G becomes disconnected due to too weak
signal strength and only the 4G master eNB remains connected
when reaching A (230m away from the gNB). This phenomenon oc-
curs at other locations with similar distance from the sector, which
implies that the coverage radius of one gNB is approximate 230m
in dense urban areas like our campus. In contrast, typical 4G link
distance is much longer, at around 520m, on the same campus. (iii)
The limited field-of-view (FoV) of gNB cells, along with building
occlusions, inevitably cause coverage defects. The gNBs commonly
use sectionalized antennas with a fan-shaped gain pattern, and
hence a narrow FoV. Location B and C outside the FoV are thus
not covered. Whereas location D and E fall within the gNB’s FoV,
they cannot reach the gNB either, due to building blockage. A de-
liberate arrangement of the gNB locations may help maximize the
coverage with minimum cost. For decades, such cellular network
planning problems have been solved using blanket war-driving
[31, 34], which becomes a daunting task as the 5G network density
and parameter space grows. A more intelligent planning mecha-
nism, which leverages the 3D terrain and building map information,
may help automate and optimize the 5G deployment.
3.3 Indoor-outdoor Gap
In the single-cell measurement (Fig. 2 (b)), we also observe a huge
bit-rate gap between indoor and outdoor cases. In particular, near
the location F , G, H , I (100m from the base station 72), we use XCAL-
Mobile to measure the bit-rate in the immediately adjacent indoor
and outdoor spots. The resulting CDF plot in Fig. 3 shows that, on
average, 5G has more than 2× indoor-outdoor bit-rate gap, i.e., 50.59%,
in contrast to only 20.38% in 4G. We ascribe the larger bit-rate drop to
the higher-frequency 5G signals (3.5 GHz), which suffer more from
penetration loss than the 4G signals (1.85 GHz) [72]. Note that the
buildings on our university campus have brick and concrete walls,
which are common in urban scenarios. The observation on the
indoor-outdoor bit-rate gap will hold true for similar environments.
Drywalls and wood construction may experience lower penetration
loss. One may refer to existing channel sounding work (e.g., [50])
for a comparison across different material types.
Considering the meager coverage of 5G indoor, we believe com-
bining micro-cells in residential/office buildings with the current
483
macro-cells, such as the 5G/WiFi coexistence based on 3GPP ATSSS
(Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting) service [2], will
lead to more seamless connectivity. Currently, a commercial 5G
macro gNB equipped with 3 sectors costs $28,833.40, in contrast
2
to $360.42 for a micro router (i.e., CPE [64]) with about 120 m
coverage, which hints to an acceptable deployment cost. We will
experimentally validate the performance of a typical indoor CPE in
Sec. 8.
3.4 Hand-off across Cells
Due to smaller coverage, 5G hand-off (HO) is expected to become
more frequent than in 4G. In this section, we first uncover the 5G
HO strategy and evaluate its effectiveness, then we quantify the
HO latency. The analysis is based on 407 HO events collected on
the campus region and other areas in our city, during an 80 minutes
measurement study at a walking/bicycling speed of 3∼10 km/h.
Among them, 387 are horizontal HOs, i.e., switching between two
5G cells; 20 are vertical HOs (5G-4G and 4G-5G).
HO strategy evaluation. We use XCAL-Mobile to monitor the
HO-related control signaling messages, i.e., Radio Connection Re-
configuration messages with embedded HO configuration mea-
surement report of the eNB/gNB. We first find that, although the
smartphone reports 5 kinds of HO-related measurement events
(i.e., 21.98% A1, 0.18% A2, 67.25% A3, 9.19% A5, and 1.40% B1, as
