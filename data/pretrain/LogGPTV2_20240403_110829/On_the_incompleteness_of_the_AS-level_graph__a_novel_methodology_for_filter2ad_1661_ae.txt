5.2 Candidate feeder analysis
We now focus on the characteristics of the elements of the
set of candidate BGP feeders found by applying the monitor
placement algorithm with parameter d = 1, which represents
the best trade-oﬀ between AS-level connectivity discovery
and the number of BGP feeders required. With d = 1, the
positioning algorithm ﬁnds the set of BGP feeders required
to obtain BGP routing information ﬁltered by at most two
BGP decision processes from each non-stub AS: the source
AS and the BGP feeder itself. The results obtained with
other values of d are available at [23].
Table 7 and Figure 8 show the most relevant characteris-
tics of these elements. Figure 8 depicts a) the degree dis-
tribution, b) the average provider degree (knp) distribution,
where knp is computed for each AS as the average degree of
its providers, and c) the number of providers of the candidate
feeders. Note that graphics a) and b) have been normalized
with the maximum value of the node degree (k) found in the
related region, in order to allow full-scope analysis and to
trace the characteristics of a typical candidate BGP feeder.
The most frequent classes of ASes found to be candidate are:
a) stub ASes (see Table 7), b) ASes that have set up a small
number of BGP connections (see Fig. 8a), and c) ASes that
have chosen a rather small number (see Fig. 8c) of small-
medium ISPs (see low-medium values of the normalized knp
in Fig. 8b) to be their providers.
Only a small percentage of these ASes are present on at
least one IXP (see Table 7), and this implies that their typi-
cal interconnectivity behavior is to not establish public peer-
ing with other ASes. Thus, we can conclude that the typical
AS that should become a BGP feeder of the current route
collector infrastructure is a small multi-homed AS, that has
set up multiple connections with diﬀerent regional providers
to guarantee route diversity and increase the reliability of its
reachability. This is not surprising since these ASes are likely
to be located at the bottom of the hierarchy and, thanks to
multi-homing can cover several non-stub ASes at once.
5.3 Current status of the route collector in-
frastructure
We now analyse how many of the current BGP feeders are
present in the ideal set of candidates found via the method-
ology proposed in Section 4. Their distribution for each
region is shown in Table 8, as well as the percentage of the
total number of feeders in the region that fall into that cat-
egory. The main result is that only a small percentage of
the current full feeders are actually part of an optimal so-
lution in any of the topologies analysed. This is a direct
consequence of their position in the Internet hierarchy, as
already shown in Section 3. These ASes are not likely to
have a large number of providers, thus their contribution is
limited. Nevertheless, there are few other classes of current
BGP feeders in the set of candidates, thus highlighting that,
in terms of p2c-distance, only a few of them are placed in an
optimal position. It is also interesting to understand how
many BGP feeders should be added to the current route
collector infrastructure in order to improve the quality of
data. To determine these values, we used the methodology
illustrated in Section 4.2.2 considering the current set of full
feeders F as part of the initial set of solution P, and consid-
ering the number of additional BGP feeders as n = |P|−|F|.
Results per each geographic region are reported in Table 9.

Table 7: Characteristics of candidate BGP feeders
Table 9: Additional feeders required in each region
262A comparison of the number of additional ASes required
and the number of non-stub ASes (see Table 4) reveals that
the methodology covered every non-stub AS with a number
of new BGP feeders which is about 50-60% of the number
of non-stub ASes in each region. In addition, a priority for
each AS found to be part of P can be identiﬁed by recording
the amount of non-stub ASes that are found to be uniquely
covered by an element in P during phase a) of the methodol-
ogy7. The higher this value is, the larger the coverage of the
element considered. The distribution of these values can be
found in Fig. 9, while the complete AS ranking is available
at [23].

Figure 9: CCDF of the number of ASes uniquely covered
The number of elements covered uniquely by a single AS
is never too large, since typically a customer demands its
Internet reachability to a set of well-known ISPs. The distri-
bution of this priority index also allows us to make a priority
selection, adding ﬁrst those ASes with the highest number
of unique covered AS values (see Fig. 9). Exploiting this
priority selection, by just adding a number of ASes compa-
rable to the current number of feeders, the route collectors
can now see about one in three non-stubs in each region (see
Table 10). This means that the capture of a more complete
AS-level view of the Internet is a feasible task in terms of
numbers of elements to be connected and, consequently, of
costs. Thus our methodology would seem to be a very useful
tool to drive the growth of the route collector infrastructure.
It must be stressed that our methodology extracts the op-
timal solution for the input data provided, thus, if a new
BGP feeder is introduced, the solution may no longer be
optimal. In any case, it still represents an upper bound to
the number of additional full feeders needed.
In fact, the
introduction of new data may add previously hidden con-
nections and may lead the tagging algorithm exploited to
infer a higher number of p2c connections. These new con-
nections may change the p2c-distance of several ASes that
might be reached by exploiting a lower number of feeders.
However, it would still be possible to apply the methodology
once again on the new data to obtain a new optimal value.
7The same ranking value is also inherited by every ele-
ment in I that is related to an element in P due to their
interchangeability. However, only one of them is required to
be connected.

6. CONCLUSIONS
The BGP route collector projects that have been devel-
oped to date are extremely valuable for researchers, as they
are the most reliable source of information for gathering
data on the infrastructure of the Internet. However, BGP
data are currently only collected from a small amount of
ASes, thus limiting the quality of the inferences that can
be drawn from analysing such data. Studies on Internet
topology structure must be fully aware of the high level of
incompleteness of BGP data, since a topological analysis of
the Internet as viewed from these monitors is like analysing a
roadmap of a given country where the highways are known,
but most of the secondary roads are not shown!
In this paper, we have quantitatively evaluated the cur-
rently available BGP route collector infrastructure, showing
that it is only able to reveal complete AS-level connectiv-
ity information about a very small number of ASes. The
current BGP feeders that are contributing with their full
routing tables are typically large ASes such as provider-free
and worldwide ISPs. This implies that the current vision of
the BGP route collector projects cannot capture any of the
p2p connections that small or medium-sized ASes may es-
tablish. The only solution to deal with this incompleteness is
to dramatically increase the number of BGP feeders of these
projects. In this perspective, we have outlined a systematic
methodology to infer the minimum number of ASes that the
route collector projects should introduce as BGP feeders in
order to maximize the amount of information that can be
collected. We found that multi-homed ASes with a small-
medium size are the most useful contributors in a topology
discovery perspective.
Our methodology provides a useful tool to select those
ASes that are the most useful in enhancing the quality of
topology information data. We are aware that this kind of
data is extremely hard to obtain, but we also believe that
the greatest problem in data gathering is that ASes are not
stimulated enough to join any of the current projects, since
no direct service is oﬀered by the projects in change of the
voluntary participation of ASes. Thus, it makes sense to
imagine that currently the route collector projects are used
by several large ISPs to promote their reachability. In par-
ticular, it might be a good idea to create services based on
the real-time analysis of the inter-domain routing from dif-
ferent points of view in return of full routing tables, following
the do ut des principle. Such services would be valuable for
many ASes, ranging from local ISPs to CDNs, and thus en-
courage them to participate. Otherwise, it might be useful
to exploit alternative tools to improve the amount of data
available. Speciﬁcally, some of the traceroute-based projects
[28, 29, 30, 31] are able to bypass the reluctance in disclos-
ing the routing information of AS owners by placing agents
directly on user applications and, thus, obtaining data that
would not be collected otherwise.
