# Analysis of BGP Feeder Characteristics and Route Collector Infrastructure

## 5.2 Candidate Feeder Analysis
In this section, we focus on the characteristics of the candidate BGP feeders identified by the monitor placement algorithm with parameter \( d = 1 \). This value represents the best trade-off between AS-level connectivity discovery and the number of BGP feeders required. With \( d = 1 \), the algorithm identifies the set of BGP feeders needed to obtain BGP routing information filtered by at most two BGP decision processes: the source AS and the BGP feeder itself. Results for other values of \( d \) are available in [23].

### Key Characteristics of Candidate BGP Feeders
Table 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the most relevant characteristics of these candidate BGP feeders. Specifically, Figure 8 shows:
- **(a)** The degree distribution.
- **(b)** The average provider degree (\( k_{np} \)) distribution, where \( k_{np} \) is computed as the average degree of an AS's providers.
- **(c)** The number of providers of the candidate feeders.

The distributions in (a) and (b) are normalized by the maximum node degree (\( k \)) found in the related region to facilitate a comprehensive analysis and to trace the characteristics of a typical candidate BGP feeder.

#### Common Characteristics of Candidate ASes
The most frequent classes of ASes identified as candidates are:
- **Stub ASes** (see Table 7).
- **ASes with a small number of BGP connections** (see Figure 8a).
- **ASes with a small number of small-to-medium ISPs as providers** (see low-to-medium values of the normalized \( k_{np} \) in Figure 8b).

Only a small percentage of these ASes are present on at least one IXP (see Table 7), indicating that their typical interconnectivity behavior is to avoid public peering with other ASes. Therefore, the typical AS that should become a BGP feeder in the current route collector infrastructure is a small multi-homed AS that has established multiple connections with different regional providers to ensure route diversity and enhance its reachability. These ASes are likely to be located at the bottom of the hierarchy and, through multi-homing, can cover several non-stub ASes simultaneously.

## 5.3 Current Status of the Route Collector Infrastructure
We now analyze how many of the current BGP feeders are part of the ideal set of candidates identified by our methodology. Table 8 shows the distribution of these feeders across different regions and the percentage of total feeders in each region. The main finding is that only a small percentage of the current full feeders are part of an optimal solution in any of the topologies analyzed. This is due to their position in the Internet hierarchy, as discussed in Section 3. These ASes typically do not have a large number of providers, thus their contribution is limited.

However, there are a few other classes of current BGP feeders in the set of candidates, highlighting that, in terms of p2c-distance, only a few are optimally positioned. To determine how many additional BGP feeders are needed to improve data quality, we used the methodology from Section 4.2.2, considering the current set of full feeders \( F \) as part of the initial set of solutions \( P \), and the number of additional BGP feeders as \( n = |P| - |F| \). The results for each geographic region are reported in Table 9.

### Additional Feeders Required
A comparison of the number of additional ASes required and the number of non-stub ASes (see Table 4) reveals that the methodology covers every non-stub AS with a number of new BGP feeders that is about 50-60% of the number of non-stub ASes in each region. Additionally, a priority for each AS in \( P \) can be determined by recording the number of non-stub ASes uniquely covered by an element in \( P \) during phase (a) of the methodology. Higher values indicate greater coverage. The distribution of these values is shown in Figure 9, and the complete AS ranking is available at [23].

By adding a number of ASes comparable to the current number of feeders, the route collectors can now see about one in three non-stubs in each region (see Table 10). This suggests that capturing a more complete AS-level view of the Internet is feasible in terms of the number of elements to be connected and the associated costs. Thus, our methodology is a useful tool for driving the growth of the route collector infrastructure.

It is important to note that our methodology provides an optimal solution for the given input data. If a new BGP feeder is introduced, the solution may no longer be optimal, but it still represents an upper bound on the number of additional full feeders needed. New data may reveal previously hidden connections, leading to a higher number of inferred p2c connections and potentially changing the p2c-distance of several ASes. However, the methodology can be reapplied to the new data to obtain a new optimal value.

## 6. Conclusions
BGP route collector projects are invaluable for researchers, providing the most reliable source of information on the Internet's infrastructure. However, BGP data are currently collected from a small number of ASes, limiting the quality of inferences that can be drawn. Studies on Internet topology must account for the high level of incompleteness in BGP data, as analyzing the Internet from these monitors is akin to studying a roadmap that shows highways but omits secondary roads.

This paper quantitatively evaluates the current BGP route collector infrastructure, showing that it reveals complete AS-level connectivity information for only a small number of ASes. The current BGP feeders contributing full routing tables are typically large ASes such as provider-free and worldwide ISPs. This means that the current vision of BGP route collector projects cannot capture p2p connections established by small or medium-sized ASes. The only solution is to significantly increase the number of BGP feeders. Our methodology infers the minimum number of ASes that should be added as BGP feeders to maximize the amount of collected information. We found that small-to-medium multi-homed ASes are the most useful contributors in a topology discovery perspective.

Our methodology provides a useful tool for selecting ASes that can enhance the quality of topology information. While obtaining such data is challenging, we believe that the primary issue is the lack of incentives for ASes to join current projects. It might be beneficial to create services based on real-time inter-domain routing analysis in exchange for full routing tables, following the "do ut des" principle. Such services would be valuable for many ASes, ranging from local ISPs to CDNs, and could encourage participation. Alternatively, traceroute-based projects can bypass the reluctance to disclose routing information by placing agents directly on user applications, thereby obtaining otherwise uncollected data.
