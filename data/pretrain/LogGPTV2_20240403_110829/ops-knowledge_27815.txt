User: I'm using Twisted 14.0.2 and I was wondering what's the correct way of doing a rotating log file without blocking I/O?
Assistant: Log files are pretty much inherently blocking things.  Eventually Twisted may integrate a non-blocking log consumer with an intelligent buffering policy, but that day is not here yet.  Good luck!
