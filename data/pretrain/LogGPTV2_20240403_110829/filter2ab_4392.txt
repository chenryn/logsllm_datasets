**ATT&CK ID:** T1071.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** File Transfer Protocols

Adversaries may use file transfer protocols to communicate with compromised systems, thereby blending their malicious traffic with legitimate network activity to evade detection and filtering. This technique involves embedding commands and the corresponding command outputs within the protocol traffic exchanged between the client and server. By doing so, attackers can maintain a covert communication channel that is difficult to distinguish from normal file transfer operations.
