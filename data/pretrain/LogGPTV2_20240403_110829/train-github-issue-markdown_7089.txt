Atom should not open an "untitled" editor at startup.
It should either start with no open editors, or else start with the last open
editor (especially where the last open editor was a folder).
Otherwise, if it starts with an "untitled" editor, one needs to first press
CMD+Shift+W and then CMD+O to get where one wants.
