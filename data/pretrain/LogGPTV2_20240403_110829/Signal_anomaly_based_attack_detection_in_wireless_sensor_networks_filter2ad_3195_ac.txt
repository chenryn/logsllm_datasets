### 1. Introduction

The following section discusses the impact of non-stationary data distributions on anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Specifically, it examines how changes in the distribution of normal and anomalous data affect the class boundary and the overall performance of anomaly detection algorithms.

### 2. The Effect of Non-Stationary Distributions on Class Boundaries

#### 2.1. Changes in the Normal Data Distribution

**Fig. 2.** The effect of a non-stationary distribution on the class boundary. Changing the data distribution will result in changes to the boundary location and shape.

- **Change in the distribution of the normal class:** This affects the class boundary of the normal data, altering \( P(N|x) \).
- **Change in the ratio of anomalies to normal data:** This alters the prior \( P(A) \) (and consequently \( P(N) \)).

**Effect on the Normal Class Boundary:**

In a WSN, the dataset consists of sensor measurements of a phenomenon. Changes in the phenomenon cause changes in the data distribution, leading to a shift in the boundary of the normal class. Mathematically, the training and testing sets consist of a time-ordered sequence of data vectors \( X = \{x_i : i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n\} \), where each \( x_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, x_{i3}, ..., x_{ip}) \) is a p-variate data vector. The probability that a data vector belongs to the normal class is given by:
\[ P(N|x) = \frac{P(x|N)P(N)}{P(x)} \]
If the distribution is non-stationary, the posterior distribution of the normal class will change over time, i.e., \( P_t+1(N|x) \neq P_t(N|x) \).

**Fig. 2** illustrates the effect of changing data distributions on the class boundary:

- **Fig. 2(a):** Initial data distribution with the class boundary centered at the origin.
- **Fig. 2(b):** Mean of the distribution for Attribute 1 shifts from 0 to 1, transforming the class boundary along the x-axis.
- **Fig. 2(c):** Standard deviation of the distribution for Attribute 2 changes, causing a vertical expansion of the class boundary.

**Impact on Anomaly Detection:**

An alteration in the class boundary of the normal data can lead to misclassification by anomaly detection algorithms. A model trained on a previous distribution may no longer be optimal for the current distribution, resulting in the misclassification of normal data as anomalies and vice versa.

#### 2.2. Changes in the Anomaly Rate

If the data distribution is non-stationary, the rate at which anomalies occur in the dataset can be affected. Some algorithms use the anomaly rate as a threshold to determine the class boundary for normal data. The class prior probabilities are defined as \( P(\omega) \). In the context of anomaly detection, there is only one class, the normal data class. Therefore, the class prior \( P(N) \) also determines the anomaly rate as \( P(A) = 1 - P(N) \). A change in \( P(N) \) will cause a change in the anomaly rate \( P(A) \). This is crucial because certain algorithms assume a known and fixed anomaly rate during model construction. If the anomaly rate varies, anomalies can be misclassified as normal data and vice versa.

#### 2.3. Effect on the Anomaly Class Boundary

In anomaly detection, the class boundary of the anomalous data is often not considered. The one-class classification approach assumes that anomalies are under-sampled, making it difficult to extract information about the anomaly data distribution from available instances. Therefore, no attempt is made to model the anomaly class. Consequently, changes in the class boundary of the anomalies, \( P(A|x) \), do not affect classification performance.

### 3. Examples of Non-Stationary Data in Real-World Datasets

We have shown that if data are non-stationary, changes in the data distribution will occur. Here, we provide details of several real-world datasets that exhibit non-stationarity.

**Grand-St-Bernard (GSB) Dataset:**

- **Data Collection:** Gathered from 23 sensors deployed in the Grand-St-Bernard pass between Switzerland and Italy in 2007.
- **Non-Stationary Characteristics:** Wind speed and direction data show an abrupt change (concept shift) over the measured period, causing a change in the normal data class boundary.
- **Example:** For node 4, the wind speed and direction data exhibit a sustained increase in wind speed from day 35, with the wind speed increasing to a maximum of 10 ms\(^{-1}\).

**Intel Berkeley Research Laboratory (IBRL) Dataset:**

- **Usage:** Used by Zhang et al. [47] with an adaptive anomaly detector and by Moshtaghi et al. [48] for updates to an iterative elliptical boundary tracking algorithm.
- **Non-Stationary Characteristics:** Requires updates to the model to account for changes in the data distribution.

**Other Non-Stationary Datasets:**

- **Signalled Road Intersection:** Sensors provide data on traffic volume, used to predict traffic volume in the next hour.
- **Weather Data:** Sensor measurements from a weather station at the Offutt Air Base in Bellevue, Nebraska, used to study incremental learning in non-stationary environments.

### 4. Analyzing Anomaly Detection Techniques for Non-Stationary Environments
