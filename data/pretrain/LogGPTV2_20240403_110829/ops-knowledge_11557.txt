User: When I want to run my python applications from commandline (under ubuntu) I have to be in the directory where is the source code app.py and run the application with command
python app.py
How can I make it (how is it conventionally done) to run the application from arbitrary directory with the command: app ? Similarly as you type ls, mkdir and other commands?
thank you
Assistant: I'm pretty sure you have to make the script executable via chmod +x and put it in the PATH variable of your system.
