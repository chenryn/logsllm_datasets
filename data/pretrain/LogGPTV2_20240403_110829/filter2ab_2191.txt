**ATT&CK ID:** T1204.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Execution: Malicious File

An adversary may rely on a user opening a malicious file to gain execution. Users can be targeted through social engineering tactics, which aim to trick them into opening a file that will trigger code execution. This behavior often follows a successful spearphishing attack involving an attachment.

Adversaries may use various types of files that require user interaction to execute, including:

- Document files: `.doc`, `.pdf`, `.xls`, `.rtf`
- Executable files: `.scr`, `.exe`
- Shortcut and script files: `.lnk`, `.pif`, `.cpl`

By leveraging these file types, adversaries can exploit the trust and curiosity of users to achieve their malicious objectives.
