User: Suppose I have python script having having 4-5 functions all are called from single function in a script. If I want to results after executing script( Use functions from another script)  I can make script executable and use subprocess.popen and I can also import these functions in another script. Which is better way to do this?
Assistant: Which is better way to do this?

Use import unless you have to use subprocess.Popen to run Python code.

import uses sys.path to find the module; you don't need to specify the path explicitly
usually, imported functions accept arguments, return results in the same process; you don't need to serialize Python objects into bytes to send them to another process
