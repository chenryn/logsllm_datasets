# Create an Event Hubs data connection for Azure Data Explorer
Azure Data Explorer offers ingestion from [Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about), a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. Event Hubs can process millions of events per second in near real time.
In this article, you connect to an event hub and ingest data into Azure Data Explorer. For an overview on ingesting from Event Hubs, see [Azure Event Hubs data connection](ingest-data-event-hub-overview.md).
To learn how to create the connection using the Kusto SDKs, see [Create an Event Hubs data connection with SDKs](create-event-hubs-connection-sdk.md).
> For code samples based on previous SDK versions, see the [archived article](/previous-versions/azure/data-explorer/create-event-hubs-connection).
## Create an event hub data connection
In this section, you establish a connection between the event hub and your Azure Data Explorer table. As long as this connection is in place, data is transmitted from the event hub into your target table. If the event hub is moved to a different resource or subscription, you need to update or recreate the connection.
### [Get data](#tab/get-data)
### Prerequisites
* A Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra user identity. An Azure subscription isn't required.
* An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. [Create a cluster and database](create-cluster-and-database.md).
* Streaming ingestion must be [configured on your Azure Data Explorer cluster](ingest-data-streaming.md).
### Get data
1. From the left menu, select **Query**.
1. Right-click on the database where you want to ingest the data. Select **Get data**.

### Source
In the **Get data** window, the **Source** tab is selected.
Select the data source from the available list. In this example, you're ingesting data from **Event Hubs**.
:::image type="content" source="media/get-data-file/select-data-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot of get data window with source tab selected." lightbox="media/get-data-file/select-data-source.png":::
### Configure
1. Select a target database and table. If you want to ingest data into a new table, select **+ New table** and enter a table name.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Table names can be up to 1024 characters including spaces, alphanumeric, hyphens, and underscores. Special characters aren't supported.
    :::image type="content" source="media/get-data-event-hubs/configure-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of configure tab with fields for configuring the data source of Event Hubs in Azure Data Explorer." lightbox="media/get-data-event-hubs/configure-tab.png":::
1. Fill in the following fields:
    | **Setting**                | **Field description**  |
    |--------------------------|----------|
    | Subscription               | The subscription ID where the event hub resource is located.     |
    | Event hub namespace        | The name that identifies your namespace.    |
    | Event hub                  | The event hub you wish to   |
    | Consumer group             | The consumer group defined in your event   |
    | Data connection name       | The name that identifies your data connection.                 |
    | **Advanced filters**       |
    | Compression                | The compression type of the event hub messages payload.       |
    | Event system properties    | The [event hub system properties](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-amqp-protocol-guide#message-annotations). If there are multiple records per event message, the system properties are added to the first one. When adding system properties, [create](kusto/management/create-table-command.md) or [update](kusto/management/alter-table-command.md) table schema and [mapping](kusto/management/mappings.md) to include the selected properties. |
    | Event retrieval start date | The data connection retrieves existing Event Hubs events created after the *Event retrieval start date*. Only events retained by Event Hubs's retention period can be retrieved. If the *Event retrieval start date* isn't specified, the default time is the time at which the data connection is created.   |
1. Select **Next**
### Inspect
The **Inspect** tab opens with a preview of the data.
To complete the ingestion process, select **Finish**.
:::image type="content" source="media/get-data-event-hubs/inspect-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of inspecting data for ingesting from Event Hubs to Azure Data Explorer." lightbox="media/get-data-event-hubs/inspect-data.png":::
Optionally:
* If the data you see in the preview window isn't complete, you might need more data to create a table with all necessary data fields. Use the following commands to fetch new data from your event hub:
  * **Discard and fetch new data**: Discards the data presented and searches for new events.
  * **Fetch more data**: Searches for more events in addition to the events already found.
    > [!NOTE]
    > To see a preview of your data, your event hub must be sending events.
* Select **Command viewer** to view and copy the automatic commands generated from your inputs.
* Use the **Schema definition file** dropdown to change the file that the schema is inferred from.
* Change the automatically inferred data format by selecting the desired format from the dropdown. See [Data formats supported by Azure Data Explorer for ingestion](ingestion-supported-formats.md).
* [Edit columns](#edit-columns).
* Explore [Advanced options based on data type](#advanced-options-based-on-data-type).
[!INCLUDE [get-data-edit-columns](includes/get-data-edit-columns.md)]

    | Managed Identity (recommended) | System-assigned | The managed identity used by the Data Explorer cluster for access to read from the event hub. We recommend using managed identities to control access to your event hub.**Note**:When the data connection is created:\* *System-assigned* identities are automatically created if they don't exist\* The managed identity is automatically assigned the *Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver* role and is added to your Data Explorer cluster. We recommend verifying that the role was assigned and that the identity was added to the cluster. |
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have an existing data connection that is not using managed identities, we recommend updating it to use managed identities.
