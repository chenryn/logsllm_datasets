**About Me:**
- I run [Irongeek.com](http://Irongeek.com).
- I have a strong interest in Information Security (InfoSec) education.
- I don't claim to know everything; I'm just a geek with some free time.

### Background

At Shmoocon 2010, I received a device called the Phantom Keystroker as a speaker’s gift. The Keystroker is designed to annoy someone by sending keystrokes and mouse movements to their computer. This led me to wonder: what if it were programmable?

### Collaboration

I approached Darren Kitchen (media mogul) and Robin Wood (code deity) with this idea. It turned out they were already developing a similar product, the **USB Rubber Ducky**:

### Personal Notes

For those who prefer to "Go ugly early," here are three notes in my defense:
1. I am new to microcontrollers.
2. I am not very skilled at soldering (think of an epileptic alcoholic with DTs using an aluminum baseball bat).
3. I also struggle with using rotary tools.

### Benefits of Programmable HID USB Keystroke Dongles

- **Speed and Accuracy:** Likely types faster than a human, without errors.
- **Stealth:** Works even if U3 autorun is disabled and draws less attention than sitting at the terminal.
- **Timing:** Can be set to trigger on a timer when the target is logged in.
- **Versatility:** Use your imagination for various applications.

### Potential Uses

- **Add a user**
- **Run a program**
- **Copy files to a thumb drive for later retrieval**
- **Upload local files**
- **Download and install apps**
- **Perform actions on a website where the target has a cookie (similar to CSRF)**

### Future Enhancements

- **Embed a hub and storage in better packaging:**
  - [Example Product](http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.2704~r.48687660)
- **Trojaned Hardware:**
  - Use a timer or sensor to embed it in another device given as a "gift."
  - Have it "wake up," mount onboard storage, run a program (like a fake BSOD), perform its task, then stop, leaving the target to think it's just a glitch.
- **Default BIOS password brute-forcing**

### Naming and Acronyms

- **MintyPwn?**
- **DIPStick?**
- **Programmable HID USB Keyboard/Mouse Dongle?**
- **Acronym: PHUKD (Programmable HID USB Keyboard/Mouse Dongle)**

### Circuit Design

- **USB Connector**
- **Common Ground**
- **DIP Switches**
- **10K Ω Resistor**
- **Photoresistor** (above 10K Ω in the dark, below 10K Ω in the light)

**Note:** The Teensy can use internal pullup resistors.

### Sample Code

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

// Header Section
// You will want to change the pins below to match your board.
int thispin;
int ledPin = 11;
int PhotoRead = 0; // Here, but not used.
int MinWait = 0;
int DIP_1 = 5;
int DIP_2 = 6;
int DIP_3 = 7;
int DIP_4 = 8;
char *DIPOptions = "Dips are used to set number of mins to wait";

void setup() {
  // Initialize the digital pin as an output:
  for (int thispin = 4; thispin < 14; thispin++) {
    pinMode(thispin, OUTPUT);
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Add your main code here
}
```

### Security Measures

To prevent unauthorized use of such devices, consider the following Group Policy settings in Windows:

- **Administrative Templates -> System -> Device Installation -> Device Installation Restrictions:**
  - [Microsoft Documentation](http://technet.microsoft.com/es-es/library/cc753539%28WS.10%29.aspx)

**Registry Keys:**
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Group Policy Objects\{EA879B20-EDB8-4FBB-972D-DDD85F5D90AA}Machine\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceInstall\Restrictions`
  - `"DenyRemovableDevices"=dword:00000001`
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Group Policy Objects\{EA879B20-EDB8-4FBB-972D-DDD85F5D90AA}Machine\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceInstall\Restrictions\DeniedPolicy`
  - `"SimpleText"="Disabled because Adrian Said So!!!"`
  
If a device was inserted while the policy is in place, you may need to enable it via Device Manager even after the policy is unset.
