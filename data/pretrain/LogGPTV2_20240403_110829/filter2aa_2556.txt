 I run Irongeek.com 
 I have an interest in InfoSec 
education 
 I don’t know everything - I’m just a 
geek with time on my hands 
http://Irongeek.com 
 I was given a device called a Phantom Keystroker as 
a speaker’s gift for doing a FireSide talk at 
Shmoocon 2010  
 The Keystroker was meant to annoy someone by 
sending keystrokes and mouse movements to their 
computer 
 But, what if it was programmable?

 Darren Kitchen (media mogul) 
and Robin Wood (code deity) 
 I knew Darren had been working  
with the U3 thumb drives for  
automated attacks, so I went to 
him with the idea 
 Devious minds think alike! They 
were already developing it! 
 They are working on a product 
(USB Rubber Ducky):

 For those that like to “Go ugly early”, hold on for 
the rest of this presentation 
 Three notes in my defense: 
1.
I’m new to microcontrollers 
2.
I suck at soldering  
(Like an epileptic alcoholic with DTs soldering with 
an aluminum baseball bat) 
3.
I apparently suck at using rotary tools too 
http://Irongeek.com 
 Likely types faster than you can, without errors 
 Works even if U3 autorun is turned off   
 Draws  less attention than sitting down in front of the 
terminal would. The person turns their head for a minute, 
the pen-tester plugs in their programmable USB key stroke 
dongle, and Bobs your uncle, instant pwnage.  
 Can also be set to go off on a timer when you know a target 
will be logged in 
 Just use your imagination!

 Embed a hub and storage in better packaging 
http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.2704~r.48687660  
 Leave it around in a thumb drive package for 
unsuspecting people to pick up and use 
 Trojaned Hardware: Use a timer or sensor and 
embed it in another device you give to the target as 
a “gift“  
 Have it “wake up”, mount onboard storage, run a 
program that covers what it is doing (fake BSOD for 
example), does its thing, then stops (leaving the 
target to think “it’s just one of those things”)

 MintyPwn? 
 DIPStick? 
 Programmable Hid USB Keyboard/Mouse Dongle? 
 Maybe an acronym? Let’s see:
