### Problem Description

While working with a WebGL project, the following render warning appeared in the console:

```
[.Offscreen-For-WebGL-0EAEC5B0] RENDER WARNING: The texture bound to texture unit 0 is not renderable. This may be due to the texture not being a power of 2 and having incompatible texture filtering.
```

Additionally, I encountered an issue when trying to duplicate a water shader material from the CodePen example (https://codepen.io/marshall_hunts/pen/GEeXJa). Specifically, Chrome was unable to load the skybox material, although it worked correctly when tested locally.

### Steps Taken
1. **CodePen Duplication**: Attempted to replicate the water shader material from the provided CodePen link.
2. **Local Testing**: Verified that the skybox material works correctly in a local environment.
3. **Browser Issue**: Observed that Chrome fails to load the skybox material.

### Additional Information
- **CodePen Link**: [Water Shader Example](https://codepen.io/marshall_hunts/pen/GEeXJa)
- **Environment**: 
  - Browser: Chrome
  - Local Environment: Works as expected

### Questions
- What could be causing the texture to be non-renderable?
- Are there any specific settings or configurations that need to be adjusted for Chrome to properly load the skybox material?
