we focus on the I2C serial bus [31] for following reasons: I2C facilitates a sophis-
ticated communication protocol, in contrast to UART and SPI. Furthermore,
I2C and UART are the most widely supported serial communication interfaces,
and in 32-bit architectures (which make 61.1% oﬀ all evaluated MCU models),
I2C is even the most supported serial communication interface.
I2C uses two signal lines: one clock line (denoted as SCL) and one data line
(denoted as SDA). ICs are chained along these two signal lines, which are referred
to as bus. In order to request and send data from one IC to another, each IC
has a distinct address. Furthermore, each IC can be conﬁgured to act either as
master or slave. The I2C standard supports multiple masters, which can initi-
ate transactions on the bus. The master that currently performs a transaction
also generates the clock signal. Slaves cannot start own transactions and remain
passive until they respond to the requests of masters. Typical examples of mas-
ters are MCUs and processors, while sensors, memory chips, and actuators are
usually conﬁgured as slaves.
A transaction between master and slaves contains two types of frames: An
address frame that informs all participants at the bus for which slave the mes-
sage is intended, and one or more data frames, each consisting of an 8-bit data
block. To start a new transaction, a master sends a start condition indicating its
intention to occupy the bus. If more than one master aims to use the bus at the
same time, the master get access that pulls the SDA line with a clock signal ﬁrst.
The other masters wait until the current bus master completes its transaction
via a stop sequence. Upon receiving a start sequence, all slaves on the bus listen
for an address frame. The master sends the 7 bit address of the corresponding
slave after which only this particular slave continues listening. Then, the master
sends an 8th bit to indicate whether he wants to write or read. Once these 8
bits are sent by the master, the receiving slave sends a bit to acknowledge its
readiness to receive data. In case of no explicit acknowledgment bit was received,
the master aborts the transaction.
After the address frame is sent, the transmission of the data frames starts.
Depending on whether the master indicated its intention to read or write, either
the master or the slave writes data on the SDA line and the corresponding device
acknowledges the receipt. Finally, the master sends a stop condition to complete
the transaction.
3 Threat Model
Serial communication on PCBs is security-critical as many high-level applica-
tions rely on correct data transmissions to function properly. For instance, spoof-
ing of a temperature sensor with false values can have a signiﬁcant impact on
manufacturing processes that require a particular temperature. The injection
of wrong gyroscope data into the serial communication of an unmanned aerial
vehicle can lead to a crash. Eavesdropping the passcode entered into the pin
pad of a safe grants an attacker access to the content without using brute force.
The manipulation of loudspeakers in headphones can injure the hearing abil-
ity of the user. All these examples show that attacks on serial communication

between ICs have serious impacts. To this end, we deﬁne following security goals
for the serial communication between ICs on PCB boards: (a) Conﬁdentiality:
Only legitimate ICs have access to the data that is transmitted on the serial
bus. (b) Integrity: The tampering with data on the serial bus during transfer
is recognized by the legitimate ICs. (c) Availability: The legitimate ICs always
have access to the transmitted data on the serial bus.
In this paper, we present a threat model that involves a so-called malicious
IoT implant. Malicious IoT implants are electronic systems that are inserted into
an existing system after the fabrication process, which feature a bidirectional
direct wireless connection to a public IoT infrastructure. The system that hosts
the implant is denoted as target system. We refer to the entity that inserts the
implant into the target system as attacker. The objective of the attacker is to
violate the security goals of the serial communication between ICs.
3.1 Untrusted Supply Chain
From an economic perspective, a supply chain can be described as a series of
inter-related business processes ranging from the acquisition and transformation
of raw materials and parts into products to the distribution and promotion of
these products to the retailers or customers [29]. The supply chain process can
be divided into two main business processes: material management and physical
distribution. In this work, we focus on the physical distribution as malicious IoT
implants are inserted into the target system after its fabrication.
We identiﬁed a number of stakeholders that are involved in the physical dis-
tribution process shown in Fig. 1: Manufacturers use raw materials and parts
to produce goods. Distributors buy goods from manufacturers, store and resell
them either to retailers or customers. Retailers sell goods to customers. Third-
party logistics providers manage the ﬂow of goods between point of origin and
destination, which includes shipping, inventory, warehousing, and packaging.
Government agencies, e.g., customs inspection, enforce regulations and docu-
ment the ﬂow of goods in and out of a country. Customers receive and consume

goods. Dashed lines: ﬂow of services (third-party logistics providers) or possibility of

goods, while having the ability to choose between diﬀerent products and sup-
pliers. Hence, the physical distribution process provides many entry points for
attackers to gain physical access to a target device. Potentially any of these
stakeholders can either be an attacker or cooperate with an attacker. Therefore,
we assume an untrusted supply chain in our threat model.
3.2 Attacker Model
We assume that the attacker has physical access to the target device as described
in Sect. 3.1, and is able to remove the device’s enclosure without leaving physical
traces. The attacker identiﬁes access points on the PCB to which a malicious IoT
implant can be connected within a reasonable amount of time. We further assume
that the target device only requires a power supply, neither Internet nor network
access are necessary. The attacker succeeds with an attack if the implant is able
to interfere with the communication of the serial buses and cannot be detected
without opening the enclosure of the product. Thus, we assume that the attacker
targets systems that are not likely to be disassembled by the user. Furthermore,
we assume that the attacker has access to a public IoT infrastructure within the
wireless range of the implant. In this case, the attacker is not required to be
physically present within the wireless range of the implant.
The motivations to utilize malicious IoT implants are various. Governmental
organizations might have an interest to use this approach for surveillance, indus-
trial espionage, or the manipulation of infrastructure in enemy states. Leaked
documents of the National Security Agency [4] indicate the usage of similar
malicious hardware for these purposes. Besides governmental entities, criminal
organizations and terrorist groups can use malicious IoT implants to achieve
