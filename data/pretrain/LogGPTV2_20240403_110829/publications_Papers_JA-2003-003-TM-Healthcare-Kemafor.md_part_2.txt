### METEOR: An Infrastructure for Developing Distributed Object-Based Applications

#### Security
METEOR provides a robust security framework, including role-based access control, authentication, and multilevel security (MLS). The MLS workflow system enables globally distributed users and applications to collaborate across different classification levels, ensuring mission-critical goals are met. Users can program multilevel mission logic to securely coordinate distributed tasks and monitor the progress of workflows across various classification levels (Kang, Froscher et al., 1999).

#### Dynamic Changes
The METEOR system includes a layer that ensures consistent realization of dynamic changes in instances (Chen, 2000). This module guarantees that all consistency constraints maintained before a dynamic change are also upheld after the workflow instances have been modified (Reichert and Dadam, 1998). These features are particularly useful for supporting scalability as the system load increases. For example, an administrator can move a portion of a running workflow to a new host or hosts that have become available.

#### Error and Exception Handling
METEOR's error and exception handling, along with its recovery framework, are designed to be scalable (Luo, 2000; Worah, Sheth et al., 1997). The most advanced component is the exception-handling mechanism, which works as follows: during workflow execution, if an exception occurs, it is propagated to a case-based reasoning (CBR) exception handling module. The CBR system derives an acceptable exception handler (Luo, Sheth et al., 1998). Over time, the system adapts based on knowledge acquired from past experiences, making it more resilient and preventing unwanted states.

#### QoS Management
METEOR allows for the specification of quality of service (QoS) metrics and requirements (Cardoso, 2002; Cardoso, Sheth et al., 2002). The system includes a workflow QoS model, estimation algorithms, and monitoring tools. Suppliers can specify the duration, quality, cost, and fidelity of services and products. Algorithms estimate the QoS of a workflow both before and during instance execution. This allows suppliers to ensure that the workflow processes meet the requested QoS, and any deviations from initial requirements can be registered and addressed.

### Healthcare Applications Prototyped Using METEOR

The healthcare sector encompasses various types of organizations, including hospitals and non-hospital-based entities such as pharmaceutical companies and laboratories. Each organization has unique requirements. Table 1 summarizes the different types of processes, the applications that support them, and their specific requirements.

| Processes | Example Applications | Requirements |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------|
| Charting, Scheduling, Discharge Summaries, Reports | Integration with patient data management software; Management of human and automated activities; Exception handling; Ease of use; Support for dynamic changes; Security; Role-Based Authorization; QoS management | Hospital Based Ordering Systems (radiology, pharmacy) Data Management and Integration; Application Integration; Support for standards (e.g., EDI and HL7); Exception Handling. |
| Non-Clinical (Administrative and Financial) | (billing, accounts receivable, claims filing) | Heterogeneous and Distributed Environments; Security; Support for standards (e.g., EDI and HL7); Exception Handling. |

#### Neonatal Clinical Pathways
Low birth-weight babies with underdeveloped organs are at risk due to various medical reasons. To monitor their development, these babies undergo several clinical pathways, such as the Head Ultrasound, Metabolic, and Immunization pathways. A METEOR workflow application was developed for the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Medical College of Georgia to automate the scheduling of procedures and eliminate errors. The application issues reminders for scheduling tests, retrieving results, and updating patient records. The workflow involves a single organization, three roles, and a single database. Timing and temporal constraints were specified in the application design and programmatically coded. The application uses WebWork for deployment, supporting human, transactional, and non-transactional tasks.

#### GeneFlow
GeneFlow is a workflow application designed for the Fungal Genome Initiative, a multi-institution consortium mapping and sequencing fungal genomes. The application handles data analysis for genome sequencing, synthesizing raw shotgun DNA sequences into larger contiguous sequences, and searching for probable genes and chromosomal features. The process involves highly specialized personnel and equipment, often geographically distributed, requiring sophisticated coordination. QoS management is crucial, with requirements including delivery timelines, profit margins, error rates, and data quality. The application integrates legacy applications on SGI, Solaris, and Windows platforms using Java wrappers and the ORBWork enactment service.

#### Eligibility Referral
The Eligibility Referral application supports the process of transferring patients between hospitals, involving three organizations: two hospitals and an insurance company. The workflow includes determining patient placement, verifying eligibility information, obtaining payment details, and getting physician signatures. The application requires an infrastructure that supports distributed and heterogeneous environments, managing workflow instances across multiple installations. Separate METEOR systems were deployed for the sending and receiving hospitals, each hosting its own web server and database.

#### State-Wide Immunization Tracking
The Immunization Tracking application is the most advanced, designed to enhance healthcare management through performance monitoring and reporting. It generates alerts and reminders for immunizations, verifies insurance eligibility, and provides contraindications for medical personnel. The system interacts with the central location (CHREF), healthcare providers, and user organizations (SDOH, schools, DSS). The clinical subsystem includes roles for various medical personnel, worklists for hospital and clinic operations, and automatic generation of medical alerts and contraindications.

This comprehensive approach ensures efficient use of healthcare resources, improving the quality of care while lowering costs.
