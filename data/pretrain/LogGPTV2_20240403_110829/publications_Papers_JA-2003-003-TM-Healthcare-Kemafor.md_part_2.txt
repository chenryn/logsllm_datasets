emergence as an infrastructure of choice for developing distributed object-based
applications.
Security
METEOR provides various levels of security, from role-based access control and
authentication, to multilevel security (MLS). A MLS workflow system enables globally
distributed users and applications to cooperate across classification levels in order to
achieve mission-critical goals. Users can program multilevel mission logic to securely
coordinate distributed tasks and to monitor the progress of workflows across
classification levels (Kang, Froscher et al. 1999).
Dynamic Changes
The METEOR system has a layer that permits consistent realization of the dynamic
change of instances (Chen 2000). The module guarantees that all consistency constraints
which have been ensured prior to a dynamic change are also ensured after the workflow
instances have been modified (Reichert and Dadam 1998).
The features designed to handle dynamic changes in workflows are also very useful
in supporting scalability, as the load increases. For example, an administrator may decide
to move a portion of a running workflow to a new host (or hosts) that have become
available for use.
Error and Exception Handling
Error and exception handling, and the recovery framework (Luo 2000)(Worah, Sheth et
al. 1997) have been defined in a scalable manner. The most advanced component
developed was the exception-handling mechanism, which works in the following way.
During a workflow execution, if an exception occurs, it is propagated to the case-based
reasoning exception handling module; the CBR system is used to derive an acceptable
exception handler (Luo, Sheth et al. 1998). The system has the ability to adapt itself over
time, based on knowledge acquired about past experiences which help solve new
problems. As the CBR system collects more and more cases, the global WfMS becomes
more and more resistant, thus preventing unwanted states.
QoS Management
The METEOR system allows for the specification of quality of service metrics and
requirements (Cardoso 2002; Cardoso, Sheth et al. 2002). The implementation of
mechanisms to specify workflow quality of service (QoS) is a major advance for
METEOR. The system includes a workflow QoS model, estimation algorithms and
methods, and monitoring tools. The model allows suppliers to specify the duration,
quality, cost, and fidelity of the services and products to be delivered. The available
algorithms estimate the quality of service of a workflow, both before instances are started
and during instance execution. The estimation of QoS before instantiation allows
suppliers to ensure that the workflow processes to be executed will indeed exhibit the

quality of service requested by customers. The analysis of workflow QoS during instance
execution allows workflow systems to constantly compute QoS metrics and register any
deviations from the initial requirements.
4 Healthcare Applications Prototyped Using METEOR
The healthcare sector has a number of different types of organizations. By healthcare
sector we mean both hospital and non-hospital based organizations. Examples of non-
hospital based organization are the pharmaceutical companies and laboratories. All these
organizations have different requirements. Table 1 gives a summary of the different types
of processes, the applications that support them, and their requirements.

Table 4-1. Healthcare Processes and Applications
The rest of this section describes four applications that we have prototyped using the
METEOR system. These applications support different types of processes, varying in
scale (i.e., number of tasks and roles, and requirements ranging from single server to
multiple distributed servers), workflow execution across different workflow system
installations, integration of legacy applications, access to databases, and QoS
management support.

The first three applications – Neonatal Clinical Pathways, GeneFlow, and Eligibility
Referral – are briefly sketched, highlighting the main requirements and implementation
strategies selected. The fourth application, Immunization Tracking, is a more
comprehensive application, and it is discussed in more detail.
4.1 Neonatal Clinical Pathways
Low birth-weight babies with underdeveloped organs are normally considered to be at
risk, for a number of medical reasons. To monitor their development, these babies are
screened through several clinical pathways. Three of the major pathways are the Head
Ultrasound, the Metabolic, and the Immunization pathways. When a human-dependent
approach is used for tracking patients, errors can occur, and some patients suffer because
the necessary tests are not performed on time. To automate the scheduling of procedures
at appropriate times and to eliminate such errors, a METEOR workflow application was
developed for the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Medical College of
Georgia.
Figure 4-1 shows the graphical representation of the Head Ultrasound pathway.
Here, an initial ultrasound is performed when the baby arrives at the NICU and is
repeated at specified intervals over a period of weeks. The duration depends on whether
test results indicate an improvement in the baby’s condition. The application issues
reminders for scheduling tests, retrieving test results, and updating patient records, to the
nurse responsible for tracking this data.
Figure 4-1. Head Ultrasound pathway
The workflow process involves a single organization, three roles, and a single
database. Some of the requirements for this process, such as timing and the specification
of temporal constraints, are not supported by the current generation of workflow

products. Timing and temporal constraints were specified in the application design, and
their logic was programmatically coded.
Since the support for advanced features, such as the integration of legacy
applications, was not a requirement, this application was developed using the WebWork
enactment service of the METEOR system. WebWork allows for the deployment of a
simple infrastructure installation with a low cost, and for easy administration.
The application uses three distinct types of tasks: human, transactional, and non-
transactional tasks. Human tasks are accessed through web-enabled clients. Transactional
tasks control the access to an Oracle database which contains patient information. Non-
transactional tasks execute custom-developed applications which perform specific actions
inside the workflow process. Examples are the scheduling of ultrasound exams and the
calculation of temporal deadlines.
4.2 GeneFlow
GeneFlow was developed specifically for the needs of the Fungal Genome Initiative. This
is a multi-institution consortium of research groups which is mapping and sequencing the
genomes of important fungal organisms.
GeneFlow is a workflow application that handles the needs of data analysis for
genome sequencing. Raw “shotgun” DNA sequence data consists of short overlapping
DNA sequences. This data comes from automatic sequencing machines. From this raw
data, the short overlapping shotgun sequences must be synthesized into larger contiguous
sequences of whole chromosomes. These larger sequences are searched for probable
genes and other chromosomal features. The results are then electronically published, with
the objective of making the annotated genomes available in the public domain.

Genomic projects involve highly specialized personnel and researchers, sophisticated
equipment, and specialized computations involving large amounts of data. The
characteristics of the human and technological resources involved, often geographically
distributed, require a sophisticated coordination infrastructure to manage not only
laboratory personnel and equipment, but also the flow of data generated.
The quality of service management is an important factor for this application
(Cardoso 2002). The laboratory wishes to be able to state a detailed list of requirements
for the service to be rendered to its customers. As an example, requirements may include
the following constraints:
• The final report has to be delivered in 31 weeks or less, as specified by the customer
(e.g., NIH).
• The profit margin has to be 10%. For example, if a customer pays $1,100 for a
sequencing, then the execution of the GeneFlow workflow must have a cost for the
laboratory that is less than $1,000.
• The error rate of the task Prepare Clones and Sequence has to be at most ε, and the
data quality of the task Sequence Processing has to be at least α.
• In some situations, the client may require an urgent execution of sequencing.
Therefore, the workflow has to exhibit high levels of reliability, since workflow
failures would delay the sequencing process.
In this application, METEOR tools are used to wrap genome data analysis
applications together in a “genome data assembly line.” Three heterogeneous platforms
(SGI, Solaris, and Windows) are used with a single database and a single workflow
system. The process requires many human and automated tasks, support for legacy
applications integration, and Web-based access to support geographically distributed
users. The integration of legacy applications on the SGI, Solaris, and Windows platforms
was accomplished by writing Java wrappers for the legacy tasks. These wrappers were
then easily integrated with the ORBWork enactment service.
The genetic workflow application presented underlines QoS management
requirements. It necessary to analyze the QoS of workflows during the design phase and
also during the execution of instances. At runtime, the system monitors instances and
registers any deviations from the initial requirements. When deviations occur, the
dynamic change interface can be used to adapt workflow instances, with the goal of
restoring their QoS to acceptable metrics.
4.3 Eligibility Referral
The Eligibility Referral application was developed for the Connecticut Healthcare
Research and Education Foundation (CHREF) to support the process of transferring a
patient from one hospital to another. It involves three organizations, two hospitals, and an
insurance company.
The design depicted in Figure 4-3 shows a consolidated workflow, including the
activities carried out by both the sending and the receiving hospitals.
September 5, 2002 11

Figure 4-3. Eligibility Referral Workflow
The workflow starts with the sending hospital trying to determine the right placement for
a patient that needs to be sent out. Once this is done, the next tasks involve determining
the eligibility information, obtaining the necessary payment information, and also getting
the physician’s signature for a specific patient. The final step in the sending hospital’s
workflow is to receive an acknowledgment from the receiving hospital indicating that it
will accept the patient. Once this is done, the sending hospital can update its database,
and the receiving hospital will take over from there. The receiving hospital also has its
own workflow for processing transferred patients. Workflow instances spans across the
two hospitals, interacting with the insurance company through EDI transactions.
The Eligibility Referral application requires an infrastructure that supports
distributed and heterogeneous environments. Workflow instances must be managed
across multiple workflow system installations. The application accesses multiple
databases and web servers. Furthermore, it requires an infrastructure that supports
heterogeneous tasks such as human, automated, and transactional tasks with EDI
transactions.
In our implementation, we have deployed separate METEOR systems – one for the
sending hospital and one for the receiving hospital. A single workflow instance executes
tasks across both the hospitals. Each hospital hosts its own web server and a database.
The databases are used to find data about patients in order to verify eligibility
information.
4.4 State-Wide Immunization Tracking
The Immunization Tracking application has the most advanced requirements of all four
examples discussed. The enhancements of healthcare management, with the development

of performance monitoring and reporting frameworks, made childbirth reporting and
immunization tracking an important rating criterion. According to the Health Plan
Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS), the childhood immunization rate is one of
the most important elements that define the quality of care.
Healthcare resources must be used efficiently to lower costs while improving a high
quality of care. To accomplish these goals, healthcare processes need to be automated.
Figure 8 shows the scope of the Immunization Tracking application in a schematic form.

Figure 4-4. Schematic view of the Immunization Tracking application
The process includes on-line interactions for the workflow application between CHREF
(the central location), healthcare providers (Hospitals, Clinics, and home healthcare
providers), and user organizations (State Department of Health (SDOH), schools, and
Department of Social Services (DSS)).
The system can be best explained in terms of the clinical and tracking subsystems
shown in Figure 4-4. The clinical subsystem has been designed to provide the following
features:
• Roles for Admit Clerk, Triage Nurse, Nurse Practitioner, and Doctor;
• Worklist for streamlining hospital and clinic operations;
• Automatic generation of Medical Alerts (e.g. delinquent immunizations) and
Insurance Eligibility Verification by the Admit Clerk; and
• Generation of contraindications for patients visiting a hospital or clinic to caution
medical personnel regarding procedures that may be performed on the patient.
