As a practical example, we consider a direct line of sight
to a green (λ = 565 nm) LED with a luminous intensity of
7 mcd, which corresponds to a radiant intensity of roughly
Ip = 10−5 W/sr. A telescope at distance d with aperture

if the observed area A has a reﬂection factor  and is ex-

 = 1, A = 1 cm2 = 10−4 m2 and Eb = 1 W/m2 (roughly
103 lx, “overcast sky”), we end up with a lower bound for
the bit error rate of 10−7.

d(cid:4) = 2 m, A = 2 m2 and Eb = 1 mW/m2 (roughly 1 lx,
“late twilight”), we end up with a lower bound for the bit
error rate near 10−4.
Figure 10 illustrates a possible detection and clock re-
covery algorithm for NRZ encoded binary data (as it ap-
pears on serial port lines), which recovers the sampling
clock signal if only the bitrate is known (or guessed cor-
rectly).
7. Receiver design considerations
The experiment in Section 5 shows the image quality that
an eavesdropper can achieve in principle under favorable
conditions by using simple off-the-shelf instruments. It is
just intended as a proof-of-concept laboratory demonstra-
tion for the diffuse optical CRT eavesdropping risk and does
not exploit a number of techniques for improving range and
signal quality that could be used in purpose-built portable
optical eavesdropping receivers.
The most important improvement is the use of a zoom
telescope to capture more photons and provide for the ex-
act selection of a target area with good signal-to-noise ratio.
The image quality of the telescope needs to be only good
enough to allow for the masking of an area of interest, usu-
ally with centimeter to decimeter resolution. This avoids
the need for high-precision mirrors such as those used for
astronomic imaging and should simplify the construction of
receivers with large apertures.
The ultimate performance limit is the amount of back-
ground light and the associated shot noise that reaches the
photosensor. An important design concern will be tech-
niques for suppressing light from unwanted sources. This
can be achieved with the help of careful geometric mask-
ing, time-domain masking, and wavelength ﬁltering.
The data provided for “X” and “XX” screen phosphors in
[13] shows that the zinc-sulﬁde based blue and green phos-
phors have a bell-shaped spectral energy distribution cen-
tered mostly at 450 and 520 nm, respectively, with a stan-
dard deviation of roughly 20–30 nm. The red phosphors on
the other hand typically have a spectrum consisting of sev-
eral much narrower lines, usually near 630, 620 and 600 nm
with a standard deviation of less than 5 nm. Color ﬁlters
or a spectrometer can be used to separate the contributions
from different phosphors to reconstruct color images or ap-
ply phosphor-speciﬁc deconvolution parameters. Careful
selection of ﬁlter frequencies can also be used to attenu-
ate background light. While both the sun and incandescent
lights have a relatively ﬂat spectrum in the optical band, this
is not the case with some types of ﬂuorescent lights com-
monly used in ofﬁces, which emit much of their energy in
a few narrow spectral lines that could be suppressed with
suitable ﬁlters.

Figure 10. This chart illustrates an algorithm for clock and data signal recovery from a NRZ binary
signal (a) with added white Gaussian noise (b). We ﬁrst convolve the received signal (b) with the
pulse shape of a single bit (here a rectangular pulse) and obtain (c). Curve (d) shows the distance of
(c) from its mean, which we convolve with an impulse series with the same period as the bit length to
get (e). The result has maxima at the edges of the original signal, which provides us with the clock
signal for sampling (c). The sampled values (f) are then thresholded (g) and we have recovered the
original bitstream (a) out of (b) knowing only its bit rate but not its clock phase.
The phosphor decay curves shown in this paper were
measured with a sensor that is sensitive over the entire opti-
cal band. It might be worth investigating, whether narrow-
band sensors observe different decay curves for different
spectral lines. If this is the case, spectral bands with par-
ticularly low high-frequency attenuation could be selected
by an optical eavesdropping receiver to improve the signal
quality further, although a tradeoff will have to be made be-
tween optical bandwidth and shot noise.
If background light is generated directly from a 50 or
60 Hz power supply, it will be modulated with twice that
frequency; ﬂuorescent lights far more so than incandescent
ones. Where the observed signal is repetitive, varying the
receiver gain inversely proportional to the background light
amplitude can further improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
Analog preprocessing at the output of the photosensor
could better approximate the optimal deconvolution ﬁlter
than just the resistor-capacitor combination simulated in the
previous section. Digital processing would then have to take
care only of any remaining inaccuracies of the analog stage.
8. Countermeasures
Once the nature of a new eavesdropping technique is un-
derstood, it is possible to suggest a range of countermea-
sures that when combined and implemented properly can
signiﬁcantly reduce the described risk.
Display surfaces as well as keyboards used for handling
critical information should naturally be kept out of any line
of sight to a potential eavesdropper. In addition, also dif-
fusely reﬂected stray light from cathode-ray tube displays
should be treated as a potentially compromising emanation,
especially when there is low background illumination and
eavesdroppers can install large-aperture equipment within a
few hundred meters. Rooms where a signiﬁcant amount of
the ambient light comes from displayed sensitive informa-
tion should be shielded appropriately, for example by avoid-
ing windows.
Various measures for jamming diffuse optical emissions
with good background illumination can be used. Back-
ground light should preferably be of a broadband nature
Proceedings of the 2002 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P(cid:146)02)

(solar or incandescent) or in the case of ﬂuorescent lights
be produced with phosphors that have an emission spec-
trum similar to that of CRT phosphors. Modern ﬂuores-
cent lights that are operated with a high-frequency current
(≥ 20 kHz) are preferable as they have signiﬁcantly reduced
dark phases and in addition individual lamps will not be
phase synchronized.
Some types of monitors include already an ambient light
sensor to adjust brightness and contrast automatically to
the surrounding illumination.
It would be easy to extend
this mechanism such that a power-saving mode is activated
when the ambient light levels fall below a secure jamming
margin. Such a mechanism has not only security but also
ecologic and ergonomic advantages. Less electric power
would be wasted in dark and empty ofﬁces overnight if
darkness acted as an additional power-saving mode trigger
and eye strain for users might be prevented by discouraging
work under bad background illumination.
The red phosphor in this demonstration showed a signif-
icantly better high-frequency attenuation than the green and
blue phosphors. In order to facilitate the selection of suit-
able CRT phosphors for information security applications,
it would be helpful if display tube and phosphor manufac-
turers as well as phosphor-type registries provided impulse-
response information in the form of double-logarithmic dia-
grams such as Fig. 3 that cover a time scale of 10−9–10−2 s
and perhaps even a closed-form approximation along with
a plot of the frequency-domain ﬁlter characteristic. An ex-
ample for a suitable characteristic parameter of interest in
the design of a security CRT might be the relative attenua-
tion provided by a phosphor for beam currents with 100 Hz
and 10 MHz frequency. It would also be helpful if monitor
manufacturers documented, which exact CRT and phosphor
types as well as which beam currents they use.
The need for special security CRTs is likely to be re-
duced signiﬁcantly with the further proliferation of liquid
crystal displays (LCDs). Their pixels react considerably
slower than CRT phosphors and most types of ﬂat-panel
displays refresh all pixels in a line simultaneously. Both
these factors suggest that this technology has a signiﬁcantly
reduced risk of leaking information about individual pixels
in diffuse optical emanations.
9. Conclusions
The information displayed on a modern cathode-ray tube
computer monitor can be reconstructed by an eavesdropper
from its distorted or even diffusely reﬂected light using eas-
ily available components such as a photomultiplier tube and
a computer with suitably fast analog-to-digital converter.
Due to shot-noise limits, the eavesdropping from diffuse
reﬂections of display light (both CRT and LED) seems only
applicable in relatively dark environments (e.g., “late twi-
light” or 1 lx) and is even then limited to less than a few
tens or hundreds of meters distance, but that alone might
already be of practical concern in some situations. Better
eavesdropping distances even under ofﬁce-light conditions
become possible with a direct line of sight, which might
include minor distortions such as frosted glass that would
otherwise be deemed sufﬁcient to frustrate projective ob-
servation.
Very much like radio-frequency eavesdropping of video
displays, the practical exploitation of compromising opti-
cal time-domain emanations eavesdropping will usually re-
quire specially designed equipment, expertise, and patience.
However it seems at least as powerful as the former, and or-
ganizations who have traditionally worried about compro-
mising radio emanations should seriously consider this new
set of eavesdropping techniques in their threat models.
