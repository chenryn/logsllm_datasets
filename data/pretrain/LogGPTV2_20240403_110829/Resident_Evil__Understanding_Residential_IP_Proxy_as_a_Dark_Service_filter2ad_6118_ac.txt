### Domains Hosted in the Direct Inetnum of This IP
We identified domains hosted in the direct inetnum of this IP using the Active DNS dataset [68]. Our evaluation on the labeled set shows that non-residential IPs have an average feature value of 5.49, while residential IPs have an average feature value of 0.016.

### IP Whois Features
We used phone numbers and email addresses to identify the owners of the inetnum for an IP. We found that residential IPs tend to have more inetnum objects (an average of 3,536) compared to non-residential IPs (an average of 1,482). This discrepancy may occur when ISPs assign large, contiguous blocks of IPs to organizational users. Additionally, we designed features to profile the size and stability of the direct inetnum for a given IP. Specifically, we retrieved the IP’s historical direct inetnums from 24 IP whois snapshots over the past two years and analyzed their sizes, depths on the inetnum tree, and variations in these parameters. Our analysis revealed that 70% of residential IPs have a size (of historical direct inetnums) below 105, while 58% of non-residential IPs have a size above 105. Residential IPs also exhibit greater stability in their depths on the inetnum tree, with a variation below 0.16.

### Evaluation and Results
We trained a Random Forest (RF) classifier on a dataset of 10,000 residential IPs and 10,000 non-residential IPs, achieving excellent performance in a 5-Fold cross-validation (precision of 95.61% and recall of 97.12%). We further evaluated the model on four labeled datasets and an unlabeled dataset (6.2 million RESIP IPs we collected) with sampled manual validation. The model's predictions aligned well with the nature of these sets, particularly on the unlabeled set, where it achieved a precision of 95.80%. When applied to the 6.2 million RESIP IPs, the model detected 5.9 million (95.22%) residential IPs and 0.3 million (4.78%) non-residential IPs. More details about the evaluation process and results can be found in Appendix IX-A.

### Labeled Set Construction
From the available datasets, we constructed a labeled set with 10,000 residential IPs and 10,000 non-residential IPs randomly sampled from resi-clean and non-resi-clean, respectively (see Table II). These were used for feature evaluation and classifier training, while the remaining datasets were used to evaluate the classifier.

### Host Profiling
To better understand RESIPs, it is crucial to profile their host devices in addition to their IPs. Since residential IPs are often dynamically assigned, host profiling must be completed before the RESIP host changes its IP. To achieve this, we designed a real-time profiling system that can simultaneously fingerprint newly captured RESIP hosts, measure their relaying time, and detect when they go offline or change IPs. The system consists of three modules: a host fingerprinter, an IP liveness checker, and a relaying time profiler.

The host fingerprinter sends various probes to commonly open TCP/UDP ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 22 for SSH, 23 for Telnet, 443 for HTTPS, 554 for RTSP, and 5000 for UPNP) and uses the Nmap service detection probe list [16] to identify device type and vendor information. A challenge arises because IPs can be frequently reassigned to different hosts. To address this, our profiling system starts fingerprinting an IP immediately after it is observed by our web server. This is confirmed by sending another request right after grabbing banners. If the same IP is seen again, we are confident that the banner belongs to the same RESIP. This process is called "outside fingerprinting" (outsideFP).

Another issue is the presence of private networks, which can prevent probes from reaching the actual RESIP host. Our solution leverages the fact that many RESIP providers do not inspect the target IP visited by the client, allowing our client to probe the proxy’s loopback address (127.0.0.1) through the gateway. This is called "inside fingerprinting" (insideFP). Our study found that 3 out of 5 RESIP service providers (Proxies Online, Geosurf, and ProxyRack) allow insideFP.

To optimize performance, our system conducts insideFP only if outsideFP reveals a router/NAT. If insideFP and outsideFP results conflict, we prioritize the insideFP result. For example, if insideFP identifies a printer and outsideFP shows a NAT, the RESIP is considered a printer.

The IP liveness checker and relaying time profiler scan a given IP every 30 seconds. The liveness checker pings the IP to determine online periods, while the relaying time profiler sends heartbeat requests to measure the relaying time. This information helps improve the accuracy of RESIP fingerprinting, as we consider the fingerprinting result valid only if the relaying time covers the fingerprinting period.

### Evaluation and Results
Our system, running on an Amazon EC2 instance with 60 Mbps bandwidth, 1GB memory, and a one-core CPU at 2.40GHz, can profile 800,000 IPs per hour, with each IP being fingerprinted in 63.57 seconds. In total, our profiling system acquired banners from 728,528 (11.78% of 6.2 million) IPs and identified device types and vendor information for 547,497 of them. Interestingly, 237,029 (43%) of these IPs belong to IoT devices like web cameras, DVRs, and printers. Details of the study are in §IV-B.

### Datasets
Our study leverages various data sources to characterize multiple dimensions of the RESIP ecosystem. We generated a large RESIP IP dataset through infiltration (§III-A). To construct and evaluate our residential IP classifier, we collected datasets containing residential and non-residential IPs (§III-B), and used IP Whois and Active DNS datasets for feature generation (§III-B). In our host profiling framework, the Nmap service detection probe list is used to infer device types (§III-C). We also utilized additional datasets, including PUP traffic, Passive DNS, IP geolocation, public network proxies, and dark IPs, to provide a comprehensive view of the RESIP ecosystem.

### Discussion
**Potential Bias:** Due to the challenges in comprehensively identifying RESIP hosts and analyzing their illicit behaviors, our study is based on the data we could obtain. This may introduce bias. While we believe our study offers valuable insights into this new business, we are cautious about drawing definitive conclusions. Our vantage points were limited to five RESIP service providers, and only about 10% (over 500,000) of all observed IPs could be fingerprinted and analyzed. Our analysis of relayed traffic was based on PUP traffic logs collected by our industry partner, which, despite covering 8,886 RESIP IPs and 5 million traffic traces, has limited coverage. More comprehensive datasets will help better understand RESIPs and their security implications. However, the RESIP providers we studied are representative, and we did find PUPs running behind RESIP IPs that could not be fingerprinted, indicating broader applicability of some results.

**Ethical Issues:** We paid RESIP providers to access their services and followed all terms of service. We took care to ensure our study would not harm RESIP host owners by visiting only our own domains. Users of our industry partner agreed to share related information in exchange for free services. During host profiling, we limited probing rates to avoid overheads and reported only aggregated statistics to avoid identity leakage. All studies were approved by our organization’s IRB.

### Residential IP Proxy
We conducted a measurement study on the core component of the RESIP service—the residential IP proxy. We analyzed why these RESIPs were used, how they were recruited, and what they served.

**Proxy Detection Evasion:**
- **IP Source Analysis:** We collected 6,183,876 unique RESIP IPs from five RESIP service providers. These IPs are spread across 238 countries and regions, 28,035 /16 network prefixes, and 52,000+ ISPs. The top 100 ISPs cover 57.4% of the RESIP IPs, with Turk Telekom having the most (5.7%). Figure 4(a) illustrates the distribution of RESIP IPs over countries.
- **Classifier Performance:** As described in §III-B, we trained a classifier to identify residential IPs. Figure 5(a) shows the percentage of non-residential IPs in each RESIP service provider. Overall, 95.22% of the RESIP IPs were classified as residential.

**Characterizing RESIPs:**
- **Non-Residential, Blacklisted, and Published Proxies:** Figure 5(a) and (d) show the distribution of non-residential, blacklisted, and published proxy IPs in RESIP services.
- **Relaying Time:** Figure 5(b) shows the CDF of the relaying time per RESIP.
- **Time Lag Between Blacklisting and Capture:** Figure 5(c) shows the time lag between when RESIPs were blacklisted and when they were captured.
- **IoT Devices:** Figure 5(d) shows the number of IoT devices observed from each RESIP service provider.

This comprehensive analysis provides a detailed understanding of the RESIP ecosystem and its security implications.
