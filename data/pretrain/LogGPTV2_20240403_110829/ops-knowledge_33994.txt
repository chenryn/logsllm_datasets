User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题IP address in email header? I sent an email through my normal internet provider.
Afterwards, I set up an account so I’d have VPN to hide/randomize my IP address.
If someone traces the original email (before I got vpn to change my IP address) will that yahoo email I sent, have my original IP address?
I didn’t get VPN yet, so now I’m wondering if they’ll see my IP address.
[It was through YAHOO email, using a mobile phone.]

Assistant: When a mail transport agent (a mail server) receives an email, it's required to add a Received header indicating from where it received the data.  This customarily contains information about the hostname or IP of the server, the date and time of receipt, the protocol used (including whether it was authenticated), and potentially other information.  In addition, it may include information about the account used to send the mail, which is useful for dealing with abuse problems.
The information that's recorded is what the mail server recorded when the mail was received.  If you sent the mail from a machine without using the VPN, then the public IP address will be recorded as part of the email, regardless of whether you use a VPN or otherwise change your IP address later.  If you were using a VPN when the mail was sent and you properly configured it, then the VPN's IP address will be used.
If you used a webmail client, the webmail client, as a tool that processes email, will also probably insert a Received header before forwarding it onto the mail server, and it will usually insert the IP address it saw as well.  The same policy applies from the paragraph above, just substitute &quot;webmail interface&quot; with &quot;mail server.&quot;
Do note that if you sent a mail to your normal ISP, regardless of whether you used a VPN, they will probably record the fact that you authenticated to send the mail, either in the email, or in their logs.  All reputable providers require some sort of authentication (or other sender verification, such as an IP check) before sending mail destined for other domains, because otherwise spammers would abuse those servers.  Thus, it's not possible to send an anonymous email directly through your ISP's mail server unless you use a service such as a remailer.
