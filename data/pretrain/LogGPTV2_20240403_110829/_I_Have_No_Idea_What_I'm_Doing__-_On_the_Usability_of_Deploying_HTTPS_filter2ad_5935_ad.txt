on the assignment. 18 participants reported that they
thought they ﬁnished the assignment completely, while
nine thought that there were still some conﬁguration
steps missing. One participant was not sure about
whether or not he/she ﬁnished the task. While ten
participants perceived the assigned task as difﬁcult and
three as very difﬁcult, only four participants thought
that it was easy and one that it was very easy. Twelve
participants rated the difﬁculty as neutral.
We also asked our participants what they think are the
most severe usability pitfalls in the deployment process.
In the following, we provide a respective list. Most fre-
quently mentioned were lack of best practice tutorials
(19), followed by misleading terminology (15) and weak
default conﬁgurations (12).
Lack of best practice tutorials. According to our par-
ticipants, it was difﬁcult to determine a best practice on
how to deploy TLS. Our participants reported that they
came across outdated or simply wrong information in on-
line tutorials. 13 participants also mentioned that most
tutorials were not generic, but still not speciﬁc enough to
apply them to the system given in the assignment.
Misleading terminology and error messages. Espe-
cially with respect to interactions with the CA, partici-
pants expressed confusion about the terminology. Some
accidentally uploaded a self-signed certiﬁcate instead of
a CSR and found the ﬁle endings difﬁcult to handle and
to distinguish, e.g., .key, .pem, .crt.
Weak default conﬁguration. Eight participants ex-
plicitly criticized the high effort necessary to harden the
conﬁguration, as too many cipher suites are enabled by
default. Also, they criticized that the selection of cipher
suites is a time-consuming task that requires profound
background knowledge in order to make an informed
decision and that bad decisions yield major security
vulnerabilities. One participant also suggested a simpli-
ﬁed conﬁguration option including a two- or three-way
variable to disable certain cipher suites (e.g., tinfoil hat
vs. maximum compatibility). Four participants also
Confusing conﬁg ﬁle structure. During the conﬁgu-
ration process, many participants perceived the Apache
conﬁg ﬁle structure as confusing and experienced it as
a severe source for errors. We also observed that some
participants had simple copy/paste errors in their conﬁg
ﬁles which highly distracted them from the actual main
task.
“There are multiple conﬁg ﬁles in /etc/apache2, how
and where do I have to load modules?” (P18)
“Why is there a snakeoil certiﬁcate in the conﬁg ﬁle?”
(P22)
Complex workﬂow. Six participants explicitly stated
that the workﬂow itself is too complex due to the differ-
ent approaches and branches that can be taken during the
conﬁguration process as well as the dependencies of the
subtasks. Three participants stated these factors hindered
them in ﬁnding the source of an error afterwards.
“The conﬁguration process is ﬁddly and one has to
google tons of pages to get it right. Even then one can-
not be sure to have a good conﬁguration because SSL
vulnerabilities are discovered almost on a regular basis.”
(P9)
Too much background knowledge required. Many
participants expressed their concern about
the high
amount of background knowledge required to success-
fully conﬁgure TLS in a secure way. Also, the fact that
a TLS conﬁguration must be well maintained and fre-
quently updated requires the person in charge to be in-
formed about the latest TLS attacks and other vulner-
abilities which our participants considered infeasible in
practice.
Confusing permissions. Five participants also stated
that they found it hard to choose the correct location and
permissions for the certiﬁcate and private key.
5 Expert Interviews
In order to address ecological validity, we conducted ad-
ditional expert interviews with security consultants and
auditors about their experiences with insecure TLS con-
ﬁgurations.

methodology and results of these expert interviews that
were conducted in April 2016. The interview guideline
can be found in Appendix A.
5.1 Recruitment and Interview Procedure
The participants were recruited at a security conference
in Germany with participants from both academia and
industry and via emails to regional security consulting
companies. The requirements for participation currently
work as a security consultant or auditor and to have at
least 2 years of prior experience in auditing web services.
The expert interviews were conducted as semi-structured
interviews with 7 security experts from well-respected
security consulting ﬁrms in the German-speaking region.
The experts were familiar with TLS misconﬁgurations
and frequently encountered misconceptions on how to
combat the trade-off between compatibility and security.
The interview segments were coded using iterative cod-
ing.
5.2 Results
Our results show that auditors commonly agree that poor
usability and too complex workﬂows and server conﬁg-
urations result in weak TLS conﬁgurations. They also
mentioned that the deployment process must be simpli-
ﬁed and especially the default conﬁguration should favor
security. In the following, we discuss their responses in
detail. Six interview participants were male, one was fe-
male. The average number of months spent as a pene-
tration tester or auditor was 53.2. Two participants work
in small companies with less than 10 employees, the re-
maining participants were employed in companies with
more than 10 but less than 100 employees.
Auditing TLS conﬁgurations. All expert interview
participants reported to focus on the following conﬁg-
uration characteristics during audits: activated TLS/SSL
version, activated cipher suites, if the certiﬁcate is recog-
nized by commonly used web browsers, whether HSTS
is conﬁgured and whether public key pinning is activated.
E3 and E7 also highlighted that they particularly pay at-
tention if recently discovered attacks are mitigated. E6
and E7 also said that in addition to automated tools, they
prefer to evaluate the server conﬁguration directly, if it is
accessible.
All seven interview participants use Qualy’s SSL Test as
the de-facto standard to evaluate public domains. They
also use selected Nessus modules3 and OpenVAS4 for
internal sites. E2, E4 and E6 also reported to use
NMap [30].
Conﬁguration mistakes in the wild. According to the
interview participants, the main concern when deploying
TLS is compatibility. Our interviewees, however, also
mentioned that in most cases the compatibility challenge
is just a mock argument which is often used as an ex-
cuse and not fully elaborated by the responsible employ-
ees. Compatibility is a challenge for publicly available
sites where almost any client may want to access. How-
ever, it is a rather easy-to-solve problem for services that
are only accessed internally, hence the set of potentially
accessing clients is well known. Also, backward com-
patibility with older client versions (i.e., <IE7) may not
be desired for a variety of reasons beyond TLS and will
only affect a minority of clients. However, E1 and E3
also reported that ﬁnding the best ﬁt between security
and compatibility is hard even for security experts and
often arguable. Five of the interviewed auditors also re-
ported that they often ﬁnd self-signed certiﬁcates which
do not fulﬁl the intended purpose. E1, E2, E3 and E7
mentioned that they often encounter weak default TLS
conﬁgurations with poor ciphers and no additional secu-
rity measures (e.g., HSTS).
Two auditors mentioned that in the course of look-
ing at TLS conﬁgurations for many years, they have
never encountered HTTP public key pinning during an
audit. Also, one interview participant reported that TLS
deployment is not sufﬁciently streamlined in compa-
nies. According to them, most companies have multi-
ple servers with varying conﬁgurations and each one is
maintained and updated separately.
E2 also highlights that the ideal TLS conﬁguration
has changed frequently in the last two years or algo-

rithms have been deprecated which implies a signiﬁcant
overhead for administrators to keep their conﬁgurations
up to date. E2, E4 and E7 also reported that companies
do not fully make use of the online sources available,
such as using Qualy’s SSL test for public domains.
“In most cases backward compatibility is the show-
stopper regarding proper TLS conﬁgurations.” (E3)
Concerns in the wild. We also asked our interviewees
about the concerns that admins, CSOs and other persons
in charge have regarding TLS. Our experts agreed that
especially administrators are aware that conﬁguring TLS
is a sensitive task during which several things can go
wrong. However, lack of time seems to be a major is-
sue and administrators often do not have the resources
to get a deep understanding on the fundamentals. To
our surprise, E4 and E7 reported that they frequently
encounter responsible persons that have little or no ex-
perience with security protocols such as TLS. All inter-
view participants reported that in the course of security
audits, they also frequently ﬁnd weak default conﬁgura-
tions along with little awareness regarding the weakness
of such conﬁgurations and how they could easily be hard-
ened. E7 highlighted that responsible persons even report
that they are “afraid of using crypto”. As an example (de-
scribed in 5.2), E1 explicitly mentioned HSTS which is
easy to deploy and has no impact on compatibility, but is
rarely used in practice.
Also, compatibility still remains a key concern as lack
of compatibility often leads to overloaded help lines, as
reported by E1, E6 and E7. Also, the risk of MITM at-
tacks is often underestimated and companies do not per-
ceive themselves as targets of such attacks. E7 cited an
administrator from an SME saying: “Our conﬁguration
supports basic encryption, so this should be more than
enough... and clearly is better than no encryption.” As E2
reports, companies are often concerned about introduc-
ing encryption due to the additional performance over-
head which is in their opinion not worth the effort.
Suggested usability improvements. A common opin-
ion of all interviewees was that the default server conﬁg-
urations must be improved by simpliﬁcations and default
security options. They said that server conﬁgurations
should be secure by default, i.e., that TLS should be en-
abled by default and hence must be explicitly disabled if
necessary. E1 highlighted that Apache has a weak default
conﬁguration for compatibility reasons and mentioned
the Caddy web server5 as a good and usable example.
Caddy comes with a TLS conﬁguration by default and
5https://caddyserver.com/
uses Let’s Encrypt to get certiﬁcates. Also, according
to E1 the by default activated cipher suites are a good
compromise, and even OCSP stapling and HSTS are de-
ployed by default. Also, the Caddy web server automati-
cally renews certiﬁcates. E1 highlights that conﬁguration
directives must be simpliﬁed to yield strong conﬁgura-
tions and that Caddy web server is a good example for
this paradigm. E1 also suggests that compatibility ﬂags
which administrators can use to conﬁgure cipher suites
would be much more helpful than letting them deal with
cipher suites directly.
Regarding the deployment process in larger enter-
prises that maintain multiple servers, E1 proposes to cre-
ate a strong sample conﬁguration on a test server and to
then deploy them on all servers. This potentially helps to
avoid outdated conﬁgurations, as the updating process is
simpliﬁed and the person in charge is aware of the TLS
conﬁguration on all devices by knowing the essentials of
the sample conﬁguration.
E1 also suggests to deploy everything that does not re-
sult in lower compatibility, i.e., OCSP stapling which is
commonly ignored by clients who do not understand the
according header. While public key pinning is rather dif-
ﬁcult to fully deploy, it can easily be used in report-only
mode and thus enables to detect MITM attacks. E1 high-
lights that these additional functionalities are beneﬁcial
for security but rarely encountered in the wild.
E3 also suggests that HTTPS should fully replace
HTTP to solve security problems. E3 also thinks that
HTTP has no fundamental beneﬁt over HTTPS with
TLS. E3 shifts the responsibility from servers to clients
and stated that clients should be frequently updated to
support the respective ciphers. Furthermore, E3 argues
that the concept behind CAs also has its ﬂaws, i.e., lack
of certiﬁcate transparency, certiﬁcate revocation and law-
ful interception on the CA’s side without the end user’s
consent. She/he also claims that browsers generally trust
a high number of CAs with varying trustworthiness.
E7 highlighted the need for professional education and
that “doing it right” requires experienced professionals
that keep track of the ongoing changes. E7 also sug-
gested that there is a high demand for better conﬁg-
uration guides and easier-to-use default conﬁgurations
to compensate the lack of know-how of the persons in
charge as well as to make it easier for everyone to conﬁg-
ure TLS in a secure yet compatible way. Also, this inter-
view participant said that companies should have policies
regarding encryption and compatibility to make it easier
for administrators to choose the right conﬁguration.

While related work already showed that TLS conﬁgu-
rations in the wild are often weak and thus do not suf-

ﬁciently protect Internet users from MITM attacks, our
work explores the reasons for this. In comparison to most
related user studies, we focus on the expert user role in-
stead of the non-expert end user who is mostly unaware
of potential risks and clicks through warnings which are
often hard to understand and do not sufﬁciently commu-
nicate security risks.
We were surprised by the helplessness that we encoun-
tered during the lab study. The security auditors who par-
ticipated in our expert interviews draw a similar picture
of the administrators’ reaction when confronted with the
results of an audit which strengthens the ecological va-
lidity of our results.
For our sample, we selected top students that success-
fully completed security courses and proved their techni-
cal knowledge in an initial knowledge survey. 17 out of
28 participants were already experienced with managing
servers in a corporate environment. We also compare the
technical knowledge of our participants with those from
Fahl et al. [19] who surveyed 755 webmasters. Their re-
sults suggest that webmasters often lack of a detailed un-
derstanding of the SSL security features and that they are
not sufﬁciently educated. Fahl et al. [19] also found that
real world webmasters heavily rely on online sources to
compensate for their lack of knowledge.
Based on this comparison and the results from our ex-
pert interviews we are conﬁdent that our sample is suited
to explore usability challenges and reﬂects the diverse
knowledge of administrators in the wild.
Our results suggest that poor usability is a key is-
sue and by far the main reason for weak conﬁgurations.
Through both our lab study and the expert interviews we
found that even professionals lack the knowledge regard-
ing the underlying cryptographic fundamentals such as
