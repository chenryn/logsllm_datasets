### Assignment Completion and Difficulty

In the assignment, 18 participants reported that they believed they had completed the task fully, while nine participants felt that some configuration steps were still missing. One participant was uncertain about whether they had finished the task. Regarding the perceived difficulty of the task, ten participants found it difficult, and three found it very difficult. Only four participants thought it was easy, and one participant considered it very easy. Twelve participants rated the difficulty as neutral.

### Usability Pitfalls in Deployment

We also asked participants to identify the most significant usability challenges they encountered during the deployment process. The following list summarizes their responses:

1. **Lack of Best Practice Tutorials (19 mentions)**
   - Participants found it challenging to determine best practices for deploying TLS. They often encountered outdated or incorrect information in online tutorials. Additionally, 13 participants noted that most tutorials were not generic enough to be applied to the specific system used in the assignment, yet they were also not detailed enough to be useful.

2. **Misleading Terminology and Error Messages (15 mentions)**
   - Interactions with the Certificate Authority (CA) were particularly confusing. Some participants mistakenly uploaded a self-signed certificate instead of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). They also struggled with file extensions such as .key, .pem, and .crt, finding them difficult to distinguish and handle.

3. **Weak Default Configuration (12 mentions)**
   - Eight participants criticized the high effort required to harden the default configuration, which often includes too many enabled cipher suites. They noted that selecting appropriate cipher suites is time-consuming and requires extensive background knowledge. Poor decisions can lead to significant security vulnerabilities. One participant suggested a simplified configuration option with a two- or three-way variable to disable certain cipher suites (e.g., "tinfoil hat" vs. "maximum compatibility").

4. **Confusing Configuration File Structure (Multiple mentions)**
   - Many participants found the Apache configuration file structure confusing and error-prone. Copy/paste errors in the configuration files were common and distracting. For example:
     - "There are multiple config files in /etc/apache2, how and where do I have to load modules?" (P18)
     - "Why is there a snakeoil certificate in the config file?" (P22)

5. **Complex Workflow (6 mentions)**
   - Six participants stated that the overall workflow was too complex due to the various approaches and branches that could be taken during the configuration process. Three participants mentioned that this complexity hindered their ability to trace and resolve errors.
     - "The configuration process is fiddly and one has to google tons of pages to get it right. Even then, one cannot be sure to have a good configuration because SSL vulnerabilities are discovered almost on a regular basis." (P9)

6. **Too Much Background Knowledge Required (Multiple mentions)**
   - Many participants expressed concern about the high amount of background knowledge required to configure TLS securely. They also noted that maintaining and frequently updating a TLS configuration requires staying informed about the latest TLS attacks and vulnerabilities, which they found impractical.

7. **Confusing Permissions (5 mentions)**
   - Five participants found it challenging to choose the correct location and permissions for the certificate and private key.

### Expert Interviews

To address ecological validity, we conducted additional expert interviews with security consultants and auditors to gather their experiences with insecure TLS configurations.

#### 5.1 Recruitment and Interview Procedure

Participants were recruited at a security conference in Germany, which included attendees from both academia and industry, and through emails to regional security consulting companies. The requirements for participation were current employment as a security consultant or auditor and at least two years of experience in auditing web services. Seven security experts from well-respected firms in the German-speaking region were interviewed using a semi-structured format. The interview segments were coded using iterative coding.

#### 5.2 Results

Our results show that auditors commonly agree that poor usability and overly complex workflows and server configurations result in weak TLS configurations. They emphasized the need to simplify the deployment process and favor security in default configurations. Key findings include:

- **Auditing TLS Configurations:**
  - All experts focused on activated TLS/SSL versions, cipher suites, certificate recognition by web browsers, HSTS configuration, and public key pinning. Some also paid attention to recently discovered attack mitigations. In addition to automated tools, some experts preferred direct evaluation of server configurations when accessible.

- **Configuration Mistakes in the Wild:**
  - The main concern was compatibility, though it was often used as an excuse rather than a valid reason. Compatibility is more critical for publicly available sites but less so for internal services. Backward compatibility with older clients (e.g., <IE7) was not always necessary. Weak default configurations, including poor ciphers and lack of additional security measures, were frequently observed.

- **Concerns in the Wild:**
  - Administrators are aware that configuring TLS is sensitive and prone to errors. Lack of time and resources often prevents administrators from gaining a deep understanding of the fundamentals. Some responsible persons had little or no experience with security protocols like TLS. Weak default configurations and a lack of awareness about their weaknesses were common. Some administrators were "afraid of using crypto."

- **Suggested Usability Improvements:**
  - Experts agreed that default server configurations should be secure and simple. TLS should be enabled by default, and administrators should have to explicitly disable it if necessary. The Caddy web server was cited as a good example, as it comes with a secure default configuration and automatic certificate renewal. Simplified configuration directives and strong sample configurations for larger enterprises were also recommended.

### Discussion

While previous research has shown that TLS configurations in the wild are often weak, our study explores the underlying reasons. We focused on the expert user role, unlike other studies that focus on non-expert end users. Our participants, who were top students with proven technical knowledge, still experienced significant challenges, highlighting the importance of usability in TLS configuration. The results from our expert interviews further support these findings, emphasizing the need for better education, simpler default configurations, and more user-friendly tools.
