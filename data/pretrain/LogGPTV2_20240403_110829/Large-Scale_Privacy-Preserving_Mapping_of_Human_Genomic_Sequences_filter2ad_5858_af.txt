putation (edit-distance calculation) at the genetic locations
found by the matches, which is shouldered by the private
cloud. We carefully designed these techniques to move the
workload from the private cloud to the public cloud, and
thoroughly evaluated their privacy protection and perfor-
mance. The study shows that the approach, though simple,
offers a high privacy assurance and can easily handle the
computation of a practical scale.

7.1 Read Anonymization and Re-Identiﬁcation
Anonymizing read data. Different from the microarray
data that targets a speciﬁc set of SNPs, sequencing reads
are randomly drawn from a human genome, which con-
sists of 6 billion nucleotides.
In a dataset with 1 million
sequences of 100-bp long, about 40% of these reads carry
SNPs, typically, one on each of them. These SNPs, roughly
0.03 of the total 14 million SNPs, can be viewed as ran-
domly picked out from the whole SNP set. This ratio can
become even lower when it comes to human microbiome
sequencing data [8], which has about 1-8% of the reads con-
taminated from the respective human host. Given that each
random sample (all SNPs on the reads from one individ-
ual) is small relative to the total number of SNPs, the over-
lapping between two different persons’ sequence datasets,
in terms of the SNPs they share, is often not signiﬁcant.
Therefore, the question becomes that once we aggregate
multiple persons’ read datasets, each carrying a different
set of SNPs, whether the resulting mixture can still be used

tion after aggregation, and 4)data partition after noise adding.
to re-identify these individuals. We can make this identiﬁ-
cation attempt even more difﬁcult to succeed by randomly
adding to the mixture noise reads, which are randomly sam-
pled from the reference genome with its SNP sites randomly
set to major/minor alleles according to the known allele fre-
quencies in human population (e.g. taken from the HapMap
project [9]), and/or by partitioning an individual’s dataset
into multiple subsets to let the public cloud process them
separately.
The re-identiﬁcation threat. Our research shows that these
techniques are still insufﬁcient for protecting the read data
from the adversary with access to a reference population
and a DNA sample from the victim.
Speciﬁcally, con-
sider a dataset whose reads are sampled from a population
(referred to as the case group). We ﬁrst estimate the allele
frequencies in the case group by aligning these reads to the
reference genome: if a SNP site k has been covered by m
reads, and i of them have the major allele and the rest carry
the minor allele, the major allele frequency is calculated as
m. Note that this frequency often deviates from the
fk = i
SNP’s real major-allele frequency in the population, simply
because not everyone’s SNP k has been sampled. Actually,
it might well be that many SNP sites are not covered by any
read and therefore have frequencies of zero. The case group
here describes a group of human subjects whose reads are
