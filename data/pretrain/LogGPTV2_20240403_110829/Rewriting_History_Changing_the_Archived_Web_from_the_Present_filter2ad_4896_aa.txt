## Abstract
The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine is the largest modern web archive, preserving web content since 1996. We identify and analyze several vulnerabilities in the Wayback Machine's archiving process and leverage these to create, to our knowledge, the first attacks that can alter a user’s view of archived web pages. These vulnerabilities arise from the unique interaction between the Wayback Machine, other websites, and a user’s browser, allowing attackers to manipulate users' views without compromising the archives themselves. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks through proof-of-concept implementations and conduct a measurement study to quantify the prevalence of these vulnerabilities. Finally, we explore potential defenses for archives, website publishers, and users, and present a prototype defense, ArchiveWatcher, for clients of the Wayback Machine.

## 1. Introduction
The Wayback Machine is a publicly accessible web archive that has cataloged over 286 billion web pages from 1996 to 2017 [26]. It allows users to access snapshots of past websites, enabling both ordinary citizens and technical experts to see how the web has evolved. These snapshots are rendered in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, preserving not only the content but also the dynamic behaviors of the original pages.

The Wayback Machine is widely used in various critical contexts, such as scholarly articles, journalism, and legal proceedings. Scientists may cite archived snapshots to ensure the durability of their references [19, 41], while journalists use it to track changes in official government pages [38]. Lawyers often use archival snapshots as evidence in legal cases, including civil and criminal cases, administrative proceedings, and patent litigation (e.g., [1, 2, 4, 40]). The importance of these uses suggests potential incentives for intentional manipulation of the archives.

This paper is the first to investigate the technical vulnerabilities and attacks that could be used to manipulate the Wayback Machine. We find that there are several types of vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to control clients' views of archived snapshots. For example, snapshots can sometimes mix content from the live web, allowing servers on the live web to inject content or code into clients' views of the archive. Our attacks are global and do not require compromising the archival or publisher servers.

We demonstrate the viability of these attacks with proofs-of-concept, showing that arbitrary JavaScript code can be injected into client views of archival snapshots, allowing for the modification of text, images, styling, and behavior. Figure 1 illustrates an attack where we took complete control of a 2011 snapshot of reuters.com.

We then quantify the prevalence of these vulnerabilities through a measurement study of archived websites. We find that over 74% of the Top 500 most popular websites contain some vulnerability that exposes the snapshot to complete control by an attacker (65% for URLs sampled from the Top Million). Additionally, 37 domains referenced in 991 legal documents are vulnerable to attacks that provide complete control.

Before publishing this paper, we disclosed these vulnerabilities to the Wayback Machine and made our defense, ArchiveWatcher, publicly available. Links to the code for ArchiveWatcher and other artifacts from the paper, including the TrackingExcavator tool, can be found at https://rewritinghistory.cs.washington.edu.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 How Web Archives Work
**Overview: Archival Protocol and Systems.** We focus on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, the largest publicly available web archive, which aims to archive as much of the public web as possible. While our attacks were developed against the Wayback Machine, they provide a basis for understanding how other archives and systems that rehost content could be manipulated.

The Wayback Machine consists of two major components: the archive crawler, which visits, retrieves, and archives web pages, and the archive front-end, which allows users to view the archived web via https://web.archive.org. An archival snapshot refers to the preservation of a top-level page, and the archival captures refer to the subresources (e.g., images, scripts, CSS) of the page. Each snapshot or capture is saved at a specific timestamp, which appears in its URL. When a browser accesses a snapshot, it downloads, parses, executes, and renders the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, with the archive serving the resources.

The archive crawler performs regular crawls of a large set of pages, providing significant coverage of the web. Any person can use the "Save Page Now" feature to immediately capture a web page and its subresources.

### 2.2 How Are Web Archives Used?
Web archives are used in various important social contexts, including legal proceedings, news articles, and academic publications. We are particularly interested in their use in legal proceedings due to the importance of the legal process and the potential for involved parties to launch attacks to modify evidence in their favor. Lawyers use web archives in a wide variety of legal contexts, such as civil lawsuits, criminal cases, administrative proceedings, federal claims court, and patent litigation. They may use archival evidence to demonstrate prior art or recover evidence of wrongdoing that has been deleted from the live web.

### 2.3 Legal Guidance on Web Archives
Legal scholars have written on the evidence standards governing the admissibility of archival material. Eltgroth encouraged the use of existing evidence standards to allow reliable evidence from the Wayback Machine to be admitted as any other internet-derived proof [21], while Gazaryan argued in 2013 for more stringent standards [22].

## Contributions
- **Vulnerability Analysis:** We analyze the Wayback Machine to identify vulnerabilities that enable adversaries to manipulate clients’ views of archival snapshots (Section 4).
- **Attack Development:** We develop and execute proofs-of-concept of attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities, changing the appearance and behavior of snapshots seen by all visitors (Section 5).
- **Measurement Study:** We measure the prevalence of these vulnerabilities, finding that they are quite common, including in snapshots cited in legal cases (Section 6).
- **Defenses:** We explore possible defenses and build an end-user defense, ArchiveWatcher, that detects and blocks vulnerabilities to our attacks (Section 7).

## Conclusion
Our work highlights the need for robust defenses to protect the integrity of web archives. By identifying and demonstrating the feasibility of these attacks, we aim to raise awareness and encourage the development of effective countermeasures.
