device. Whenever distance(xt, µD, ΣD) < thresh for packet
xt, we identify the packet as being transmitted by the target
device D. The threshold can be chosen in two ways. One way
would be to choose a threshold that guarantees a certain FNR
in a validation set. Another way can be to pick a threshold that
minimizes F P R2 + F N R2, so that their values are balanced.
In this paper, we use these two methods for selecting the
threshold depending on the goal of the experiment.
Additionally, since the MAC address of every BLE device
is stable for a limited duration of time, we can receive multiple
packets that we know belong to the same BLE device. As a
result, we can use multiple packets to identify a BLE device,
reducing inter-packet noise. One way that we found most
effective to use multiple packets was to ﬁrst average the feature
vector x for all packets from the same BLE device, and then

Summary: We identify a device based on the Mahalanobis
distance to its previously recorded hardware imperfection
ﬁngerprint. Also, since BLE devices have temporarily stable
identiﬁers in their packets, we can identify a device based
on the average over multiple packets, increasing identiﬁcation
accuracy.
IV. CHALLENGES
There are ﬁve primary challenges that limit the effectiveness
of tracking BLE devices based on their physical-layer ﬁnger-
print. For each challenge, we perform controlled experiments
or theoretical analysis to investigate how signiﬁcantly they
affect ﬁngerprinting accuracy in practice. We found that BLE
tracking attacks are likely to be feasible in practice. However,
the attacker’s ability to track a speciﬁc device will vary
depending on several factors that are out of their control.
A. Uniqueness of BLE ﬁngerprints
BLE transmitters must have unique imperfections if an
attacker wants to differentiate their target from other nearby
devices. To evaluate how similar BLE ﬁngerprints are in
practice, we compare the ﬁngerprint of many devices across
three different popular BLE chipsets. Speciﬁcally, we captured
the ﬁngerprint of eight recent iPhones with WiFi+BLE combo
chipsets, 20 ESP32 WiFi+BLE microcontroller chipsets, and
20 TI CC2640 BLE-only chipsets used in low-power devices
(e.g., ﬁtness trackers). We captured 100 packets using a high-
quality SDR (USRP N210) from each of these devices in a
controlled environment (i.e., an RF isolation chamber). We
computed the ﬁngerprint of each device across all 100 packets
using the methodology described in the previous section.
Figure 6 shows the mean of the ﬁngerprint metrics for
each of the 48 devices. We plot only the CFO and I/Q offset
metrics to simplify the visualization, adding I/Q imbalance
does not change the conclusions of the experiment. Overall,
most of the 48 devices have unique ﬁngerprints. However,
there are a few devices that have similar ﬁngerprints, making
Fig. 7: TI’s BLE-only transmitter. This is not an I/Q modulator.
them more difﬁcult to uniquely identify. The distribution of
device ﬁngerprints also appears to be dependent on the chipset.
Namely, there are striking differences in how the I/Q offset
metric is distributed between different chipsets. For instance,
the ESP32 devices have a much larger range of I/Q offsets
than the iPhones, which may be because ESP32s are low-end
chipsets compared to the high-performance WiFi+BLE combo
chipsets used in iPhones.
Surprisingly, the TI BLE-only chipsets all have negligible
I/Q offset. Recall in Section III, we described how unlike WiFi,
BLE is not an inherently I/Q modulated protocol; therefore, the
TI’s BLE-only chipset may have I/Q offset because it may not
use an I/Q modulator. We conﬁrmed this suspicion by ﬁnding
a technical report that describes the TI BLE chipset radio
architecture: it uses a PLL-based (non-I/Q) modulator [36].
Summary: An attacker’s ability to uniquely identify a target
device’s ﬁngerprint depends on the BLE chipset it is using, as
well as the chipsets of the other devices nearby. Distinguishing
devices with the same chipset is likely more difﬁcult than
distinguishing devices with different chipsets. This may make
tracking attacks difﬁcult in practice because targets are likely
to use the same popular devices (e.g., iPhone).
B. Temperature stability of BLE ﬁngerprints
A device’s BLE ﬁngerprint must be stable to track over
time across multiple locations. However, a device’s CFO may
drift when the temperature of the device changes. CFO is
a product of imperfections in the crystal oscillator used to
generate the transmitter’s center frequency (e.g., 2.480 GHz),
and the frequency error of a crystal oscillator has a well-
deﬁned relationship with its temperature called the “Bechmann
curve”. The relationship between temperature changes and I/Q
imperfections is not as well understood as with CFO.
Smartphones are particularly exposed to temperature varia-
tions. Their internal temperature can signiﬁcantly change due
to internal components heating up (and cooling down) when
activity changes, and they also experience a variety of ambient
temperatures [20]. However, it is possible that smartphones do
not have instability in their BLE transmissions. The impact of
temperature on CFO is dependent on the cut angle and face
of the crystal [12], and smartphones may use high-quality
crystals that have less frequency drift due to temperature
changes. Also, smartphones may use temperature compensated
crystals as they may be required for high-data rate cellular
communication chipsets.

Fig. 9: Metric stability while putting the phone in a pocket
We performed controlled experiments to observe how tem-
perature affects CFO and I/Q offset of a typical smartphone.
We tested the effects of internal components changing tem-
perature by playing a graphics-heavy game (Asphalt 9), and
the effects of ambient temperature by putting an idle phone
into a user’s pants pocket. Our test device was a common
smartphone, a Moto G6, and it was running a COVID–
19 contact tracing app to generate BLE transmissions. Each
test ran for 15 minutes. During the tests we captured the
ﬁngerprint metrics from each BLE packet with a USRP
N210. Simultaneously, we also captured readings from all the
internal temperature sensors of the device. We only present the
temperature sensor data that most closely correlated with the
changes in CFO, which was the Power Management Integrated
Circuit’s temperature sensor.
Figures 8 and 9 show the per-packet variation in CFO
and IQ offset during the 15-minute tests. We do not show
the variation in I/Q imbalance as it as we found it has
a similar relationship to temperature as I/Q offset. For the
game experiment (Figure 8), we observe that the CFO has a
linear relationship to the changes in temperature. When the
game begins, the CFO increases, and when the game ends,
it decreases. At the peak internal temperature (+10°C above
baseline), we observe a signiﬁcant CFO deviation (7 kHz). For
the in-pocket experiment (Figure 9), the peak change in CFO
is much less than the game experiment (2 kHz). However, it
is still signiﬁcant enough to introduce confusion with other
devices that have similar I/Q metrics (Figure 6). Finally,
ﬁgures 8 and 9 both show that I/Q offset (and I/Q imbalance
which is not shown) does not correlate with temperature.
Summary: Device temperature changes signiﬁcantly change
the CFO a smartphone, but not the I/Q imperfections. If an
attacker tries to track a device when it is under heavy use,
it will need to allow for signiﬁcant differences in CFO from
the initial ﬁngerprint, which may result in increased confusion
with other nearby devices. Also, putting an idle device in a
user’s pocket changes the CFO signiﬁcantly enough to cause
confusion as well. Ideally, an attacker would both get an initial
ﬁngerprint, and try to identify the device, in the of the most
common use case for the device: idle in the user’s pocket.
C. Differences in BLE transmitter power
BLE transmit power affects how far away an attacker can
track a target. If some devices have lower transmit power,
it is more difﬁcult for an attacker to capture their beacons.
One may assume that all similar devices (e.g., smartphones)
would use similar transmit power—especially when they are
running the same popular app. In particular, we would expect
similar transmit power for the same contact
tracing apps,
where transmit power correlates with distance where the
contact occurred. However, transmit power is conﬁgurable:
BLE APIs on mobile devices allow applications to set their
beacon transmit power to match the needs of the application.
We measured the received SNR of BLE beacons from
several popular smartphones while they were running the Ap-
ple/Google COVID–19 contact tracing app. The measurement
was performed with a USRP N210, and all the phones were
placed at the same distance (15 feet) from the USRP. We
performed this measurement on ﬁve different phones, running
latest version of iOS and different versions of Android. We
installed the same ofﬁcial California COVID–19 contact trac-
ing app on all the devices. Then, we averaged the SNR over
100 received packets from each of the devices.
Figure 10 shows that the iPhone 8 has an SNR 10 dB
higher than all other Android phones we tested. Therefore, the
iPhone’s BLE beacons are likely to be received considerably
farther away than the other devices. Anecdotally, we observed
that an iPhone’s COVID–19 contact tracing beacons 7 meters
farther than any of the Android devices we tested*.
Summary: There can be signiﬁcant differences in BLE
transmit power across devices, and even across apps running
on devices. We observed that iPhones transmit COVID–19

Summary: Attackers can use lower-cost ($179) hobbyist-
grade SDRs to do physical-layer attacks, but they will likely
have to calibrate the differences between their SDRs before
they deploy them.
E. Mobility of target device
Physical-layer tracking would be impossible if the BLE
ﬁngerprint of BLE device changes as it moves from one
physical
location to another. Speciﬁcally, ﬁngerprints may
change due to differences in the target’s physical environment
(e.g., multipath in one room vs. another), and differences in
motion of the target (e.g., walking vs. driving).
Physical environment: A change in the physical location
of the target can alter the received signal’s SNR due to
changes multipath conditions. However, we observed that this
appears to have an insigniﬁcant impact on BLE ﬁngerprinting
metrics. In Section V-C, we will demonstrate that we can
accurately identify 17 target devices across different locations.
Furthermore, Figures 12 and 11 show the that above a certain
minimum SNR (∼10 dB), changes in SNR do not impact
identiﬁcation accuracy
Speed of Motion: A moving BLE device may experience
a velocity-dependent frequency offset due to the Doppler
effect [41]. While this may cause a slight drift in the CFO
of the BLE target device, the impact is not signiﬁcant for the
frequencies that BLE operates at.
For example, if a BLE device is moving at a velocity of 80
kilometers per hour, and the receiver is stationary, the Doppler
frequency offset at 2.4 GHz is about 180 Hz. This is only
˜50% of the median of standard deviation of CFO for BLE
devices we observed in the ﬁeld (Figure 5). Therefore, even at
relatively high speed motion, the Doppler shift doesn’t impact
an attacker’s ability to track devices.
Summary: Changing location, or speed, of BLE device has
an insigniﬁcant impact on the attacker’s ability to accurately
ﬁngerprint and identify a target device.
V. FIELD EVALUATION
Several of the challenges described in the previous section
raise the possibility that there are realistic scenarios where
an attacker may falsely identify their target is present when
it is not (False Positive), or falsely identify their target is
not present when it is (False Negative). Determining how
often these errors happen in practice requires a ﬁeld study.
Fortunately, BLE devices constantly beacon, and these beacons
contain an anonymous identiﬁer that is stable for 15-minutes.
We leverage these properties of BLE to perform a large-
scale uncontrolled ﬁeld study of how severely misidentiﬁcation
errors manifest in real-world environments.
To begin with, we assess how well our BLE tracking toolkit
works, even though devices may not have unique ﬁngerprints,
and their ﬁngerprint can be affected by temperature variations.
We end with two case studies describing how well the end-to-
end attack works in the ﬁeld over multiple days. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst uncontrolled experiment to
Fig. 10: SNR of COVID contact tracing beacons across devices
contact tracing beacons with signiﬁcantly higher power than
Android devices. Consequently, attackers may be able to track
iPhones from a farther distance than Android devices.
D. Quality of an attacker’s sniffer radio
Physical-layer ﬁngerprinting attacks can require an expen-
sive high-quality Software-Deﬁned Radio (SDR) to execute.
The problem is, an SDR’s receiver chain adds signal imperfec-
tions to the transmitted signals. If the SDR’s imperfections are
unstable, they can make it difﬁcult to identify a device based
on its previously captured ﬁngerprint. On the other hand, the
more expensive the required SDR is, the fewer locations an
attacker can deploy them to track their target.
Recently, several
low-cost SDRs have become popular
among hobbyists. However, the stability of their receivers’
imperfections are unknown. We evaluate if one of the least
expensive SDRs has sufﬁcient imperfection stability for BLE
device tracking.
We compared the ﬁngerprinting metrics captured by a
high-end SDR, USRP N210 ($3,400), and a low-end SDR,
LimeSDR-Mini ($179). To make the comparison fair, we
sent BLE packets from a single iPhone device to both SDRs
simultaneously. We computed the average and standard devi-
ation of our metrics to evaluate if the two devices observe
the same absolute imperfections, and if they have similar
metric stability. Similar to prior experiments, we captured 100
beacons to compute these distributions.
CFO: The USRP observed a mean of -4.78 kHz and a
standard deviation of 102 Hz, while the Lime-SDR observed a
lower mean of -8.07 kHz but with a similar standard deviation
of 114 Hz. The difference is in the mean CFO is likely due
to manufacturing variations in the SDR’s crystal oscillators.
Both radios however use a TCXO-based oscillator, therefore
their CFO measurements will be stable even if the SDR’s
temperature changes.
I/Q metrics: A similar conclusion can be drawn about
the differences between the observed I/Q metrics. The USRP
observed an average I/Q offset magnitude of 0.0145 and
standard deviation of 0.0017. While the Lime-SDR observed
an average of 0.0203 but with a similar standard deviation
0.0030. The I/Q imbalance was surprisingly similar across
both devices, with a mean amplitude of 0.991 for the USRP

Data Collection
We collected two datasets of BLE beacons from uncon-
trolled mobile devices. The ﬁrst dataset was collected in
public places that were likely to contain many stationary
BLE-enabled mobile devices, including: six coffee shops, a
university library, a food court. We set up a USRP N210 in
each of these locations for approximately one hour, and op-
portunistically collected BLE beacons. We observed hundreds
of packets from 162 unique devices across all the locations.
We used this dataset to evaluate the false positive (and false
negative) rate of our BLE tracking toolkit. The second dataset
was collected in a facility where many unique devices passed
brieﬂy within range of our USRP N210. We observed dozens
of packets from 647 unique devices over the course of 20
hours of data collection. We used this dataset to evaluate the
uniqueness of BLE physical-layer ﬁngerprints across a large
number of devices.
Ethical Considerations: Our data collection is completely
passive, and we only capture BLE advertisement packets (i.e.,
beacons) that devices already broadcast indiscriminately with
the intention of being received by any nearby device. Many
of these packets originated from pervasive BLE applications
like contact tracing and device discovery. To ensure we only
capture BLE advertisement packets, we conﬁgured our SDR
to only capture BLE advertisement frequencies and mask off
non-advertisement channels [22]. Furthermore, we ensure that
in the decoding stage only undirected advertising packets are
passed on to the analysis phase.
The device ﬁngerprints we produce as part of the analysis
in this work cannot be directly linked to individual people.
Moreover, the BLE advertising packets from which we pro-
