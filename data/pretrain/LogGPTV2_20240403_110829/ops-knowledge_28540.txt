User: I have a project with some structure, it is console script. The project has setup.py file.
All I want is to install my package any way without using sudo.
I spent like 10 hours browsing the internet and can't find a working solution.
I keep getting error: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'srm.egg-info/PKG-INFO' if using virtualenv
And getting [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/test-easy-install-27105.write-test'
It works good enough with sudo(but there are troubles with uninstall, and it is still not working with virtualenv)
Using: Ubuntu 14.04, Python 2.7,
Assistant: Ok, so I f***ed up so much:
After using sudo, package files were created in the location of my setup.py and they had lock icon (system files because of sudo) and I could no longer install program without sudo.
My solution was to sudo rm -r all of the previously created locked files in program directory and those near python directory, and just install my program without sudo using --user or virtualenv.
