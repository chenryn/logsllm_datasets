**Project Overview:**
I have a console script project with a `setup.py` file. My goal is to install the package without using `sudo`.

**Issue:**
Despite spending around 10 hours searching online, I have not found a working solution. I encounter the following errors:
- When using a virtual environment, I get: `[Errno 13] Permission denied: 'srm.egg-info/PKG-INFO'`.
- Without a virtual environment, I get: `[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/test-easy-install-27105.write-test'`.

Using `sudo` for installation works, but it causes issues with uninstallation and still doesn't work with virtual environments.

**Environment:**
- Ubuntu 14.04
- Python 2.7

**Resolution:**
I realized that using `sudo` had created system-protected files in the directory where my `setup.py` is located. These files were marked with a lock icon, indicating they were system-protected. This prevented me from installing the package without `sudo`.

To resolve this, I performed the following steps:
1. Removed all the previously created locked files in the program directory and those near the Python directory using `sudo rm -r`.
2. Installed the package without `sudo` using the `--user` flag or within a virtual environment.

This approach successfully resolved the permission issues, allowing me to install and manage the package without needing elevated permissions.
