Message from the Dependable Computing and Communications 
Symposium (DCCS) Program Chair
Andrea Bondavalli, DCCS Program Chair, 2005 
  Welcome to Japan and to DSN 2005. This year’s DCCS program consists of 55 excellent papers that cover a 
wide  range  of  dependability  issues  and  show  the  depth  and  breadth  of  our  community’s  research  efforts.  This 
excellent  collection  is  the  result  of  a  quite  thorough  selection  process,  in  line  with  the  long  tradition  of  this 
conference and, formerly, of FTCS. 
  This year, the symposium received 205 complete submissions out of the 261 initial ones, a quite large number 
that demonstrates the importance of dependable computing and the vitality and creativity of our community. These 
submissions  included  several  submissions  from  industry,  and  joint  submissions  between  academia  and  industry 
besides the usual bulk from universities and national research labs. To note also a marked trend continuing from past 
years  of  cross-organization  and  cross-country  submissions.  To  demonstrate  the  international  nature  of  DCCS,  the 
submission pool contained contributions from over 35 countries from all continents. 
  The review process followed the tradition of thoroughness that has come to be expected of this conference. The 
program committee members suggested external reviewers for the papers in early December. The rate of completed 
reviews  from  external  referees  exceeded  70  percent.  In  total,  846  completed  reviews  were  produced  for  the  205 
submissions.  These  reviews  were  discussed  in  a  program  committee  meeting  in  Pisa  the  last  21  and  22  February 
2005 with more than 40 PC members attending. Each regular paper was reviewed by 2 program committee members 
and  up  to  3  external  reviewers,  while  practical  experience  reports  and  software  demonstration  submissions  were 
each reviewed  by 3 program  committee  members  and 2  external  reviewers, producing  an  average of  4.13 reviews 
per paper. Such an important  number of submissions was particularly challenging, and generating these 846 reviews 
has been possible thanks to the generous efforts of many individuals. 
I  would  like  to  thank  very  warmly  and  convey  my  deep  appreciation  to  the  47  program  committee  members 
(none of them missed a single review!) and to the 470 external reviewers who volunteered their time and expertise to 
produce the reviews. 
  Many  individuals  have  helped  me  in  many  ways  during  the  long  preparation  that  led  to  this  program.  I  am 
grateful to Paulo Veríssimo, Jean Arlat and Mootaz Elnozahy for their excellent advice, support and mentoring. I am 
also very much indebted to Silvano Chiaradonna, whose invaluable help with the set up, operation and maintenance 
of  the  START  tool  used  for  the  Program  management,  played  a  decisive  role  in  the  smooth  processing  and 
coordination of the work resulting in the DCCS technical program. 
  Thanks  to  Lorenzo  Falai  and  Ettore  Ricciardi  who  helped  in  organizing  the  program  committee  meeting  and 
other logistical functions. Finally, I would like to thank the ISTI-CNR for hosting the symposium’s Web site, and 
The University of Firenze for supporting the program committee meeting and partial sponsorship of the program. 
I hope you will find the program rewarding and inspiring. Enjoy it and enjoy Yokohama!
