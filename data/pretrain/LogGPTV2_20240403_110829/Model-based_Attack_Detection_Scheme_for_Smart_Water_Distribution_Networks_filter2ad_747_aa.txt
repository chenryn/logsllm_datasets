ABSTRACT
In this manuscript, we present a detailed case study about
model-based attack detection procedures for Cyber-Physical
Systems (CPSs).
In particular, using EPANET (a simu-
lation tool for water distribution systems), we simulate a
Water Distribution Network (WDN). Using this data and
sub-space identiﬁcation techniques, an input-output Linear
Time Invariant (LTI) model for the network is obtained.
This model is used to derive a Kalman ﬁlter to estimate the
evolution of the system dynamics. Then, residual variables
are constructed by subtracting data coming from EPANET
and the estimates of the Kalman ﬁlter. We use these resid-
uals and the Bad-Data and the dynamic Cumulative Sum
(CUSUM) change detection procedures for attack detection.
Simulation results are presented - considering false data in-
jection and zero-alarm attacks on sensor readings, and at-
tacks on control input - to evaluate the performance of our
model-based attack detection schemes. Finally, we derive
upper bounds on the estimator-state deviation that zero-
alarm attacks can induce.

INTRODUCTION
Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) are the combination of
computing resources and physical processes [14]. In the past,
process control systems were completely isolated in the sense
that they were not connected to the cyber space. However,
with the arrival of new networking technologies, physical
processes are being controlled and monitored through com-
munication networks. These advancements have greatly im-
proved the performance of our public infrastructures–e.g.,
transportation, smart grid, and water treatment facilities–
but have also led to increased vulnerabilities against fail-
ures and attacks at the communication networks, which may
serve as new access points for malicious agents trying to dis-
rupt the system. Attacks on such systems may result in any-
thing from performance degradation to physical damange,
depending on the knowledge, capabilities, resources, and
goals of the attacker.

Water distribution networks are spread over hundreds of
miles. These distributed systems are controlled by Pro-
grammable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and monitored by sen-
sors and smart meters. To operate these networks, an oper-
ator supervises the system through a centralized computer
using a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
system [8]. PLCs gather data coming from the sensors and
use this information to compute control actions to be sent
to the actuators. This automation relies on the cyber in-
frastructure to exchange information between devices. The
addition of this cyber layer makes the water system vul-
nerable to diﬀerent types of cyber-physical attacks. For in-
stance, in 2000, Maroochy Shire (Australia) sewage system
was hacked by a disgruntled employee. This hacking led
to the spillage of around one million liters of waste water
into parks and water ways [25]. According to a report by
U.S. Industrial Control System Cyber Emergency Response
Team (ICS-CERT), several attacks have occurred against
water utilities in the USA [2]. The critical nature of water
infrastructures makes them an attractive target for hackers
and terrorist activities. Therefore, it is extremely important
to ensure security of these systems.
The work in [5, 6] focuses on a water canal network. The
authors characterize the eﬀect of adversarial attacks on sen-
sor readings. They conducted ﬁeld tests to support their
proposed approach. However, such methods cannot be di-
rectly applied to water distribution networks, because at-
tackers have more access points to disrupt the system, due
to complexity of the system. The work in [23] studies vul-
nerabilities in water distribution networks. They propose a
game-theoretic approach to detect and minimize loss due to
attacks.
In this manuscript, we propose a control-theoretic model-
based approach for detection of sensor and actuator attacks
of WDNs. We obtain a dynamical model of the system from
sensor data and use statistical change detection techniques
for attack detection. Most of the related work focuses on
static detection procedures–e.g., chi-squared and bad-data
detectors [18, 4, 13, 16]. These procedures detect attacks
based on a single measurement at a time. However, in con-
text of CPSs security, only a few papers have considered the
use of dynamic detectors like the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM)
procedure, which employs sensor measurement history [9,
10, 19]. Here, for both the Bad-Data and the CUSUM pro-
cedures, we study how features of the system (e.g., system
matrices, estimator gains, and noise) relate to the perfor-
mance of the attack detector (e.g., state estimate deviation
and false alarm rate).
101Figure 1: Case Study: Water Distribution Network
We provide a comprehensive study of a real world WDN
designed and emulated in EPANET. We run EPANET for
diﬀerent demand patterns and collect the corresponding out-
put data (simulated sensor measurements) e.g., water level
in the water storage tank and ﬂow/pressure at the junc-
tions/nodes. This data is used to derive a state space Linear
Time Invariant (LTI) model for the WDN using subspace
identiﬁcation techniques [21]. This model is employed to
construct a Kalman ﬁlter to estimate the evolution of the
system dynamics. Next, we construct residual variables by
subtracting data coming from EPANET and the estimates of
the Kalman ﬁlter. We use these residuals and the Bad-Data
and the dynamic Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change detec-
tion procedures for attack detection. Limitations of these
statistical detectors are analyzed under a class of zero-alarm
attacks. Simulation results compare the performance of the
attack detectors under diﬀerent attack scenarios.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
2, the system description and the attack detection scheme
are presented. In particular, the proposed water distribution
network, the Kalman ﬁlter (and the residuals generation),
and the CUSUM and Bad-Data procedures are introduced.
In Section 3, the attacker model and the implemented at-
tacks are presented. Performance limitations of the attack
detectors and state estimate deviations under attacks are
analyzed in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the simulation
results that compare the theoretical analysis with experi-
mental observations.
2. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND ATTACK
DETECTION
In this section, we introduce the topology of the water dis-
tribution network considered here. A linear time invariant
system model is obtained using subspace identiﬁcation tech-
niques. Then, we construct a Kalman ﬁlter which is used
to construct attack detection schemes. A block diagram for
the proposed method is shown in Figure 2.
2.1 Water Distribution Network
The proposed water distribution network is modeled in
EPANET [1]. EPANET is a software tool used to model
and simulate water systems. The schematic of the network
is depicted in Figure 1. It consists of a water reservoir, a
storage tank, a pump, and seven nodes/junctions. Nodes 4,
Figure 2: Block diagram of the estimation-based
control and attack-detection.
5, 6, and 7 represent four consumers. The consumer nodes
have time-varying demand patterns based on their water re-
quirements. The controller has the knowledge of the demand
patterns, the water level in the tank, and the pressures at
the junctions. This network is simulated in EPANET and
data is collected for all measurable outputs and the input
demands. These hydraulic simulations are carried out with
a simulation time period of 10 days (240 hours) and a time
step of 15 minutes (which we also use as sampling time for
generating the state space model). The junctions and water
level in the tank are used as outputs of the control system
and the demands of the user nodes and the pump status
are used as inputs to generate a state space model of the
system. Using data collected under regular operation (no
attacks) and subspace identiﬁcation techniques [21], we ap-
proximate the input-output dynamical model of the WDN
by a set of Linear Time Invariant (LTI) stochastic diﬀerence
equations.
In particular, we obtain a discrete time state
space model of the form:
(cid:26) xk+1 = Axk + Buk + vk,
yk = Cxk + ηk.
(1)
where k ∈ N is the discrete time index, xk ∈ Rn is the state
of the approximated model, (its dimension depends on the
order of the approximated model), y ∈ Rm are the mea-
sured outputs, and u ∈ Rp denote the demand patterns.
The system identiﬁcation problem is to determine the sys-
tem matrices A, B, C from input-output data. The obtained
model provides a 70% ﬁt between measurements and sim-
ulated outputs (generated using the approximated model)
with 10 states, i.e., n = 10 (the matrices are shown in ap-
pendix). We also identiﬁed a few higher and lower order
models. Ultimately, the model with 10 states has a nice
trade-oﬀ between prediction error and the dimension of the
model. The quality of the identiﬁed model is validated by
looking at the system evolution based on the identiﬁed state
space matrices and initial state x1. The closeness of the
system evolution to the sensor measurements obtained from
EPANET indicates that this model is a faithful representa-
tion of the water distribution network (see Figure 3). The
top pane shows the sensor readings from EPANET as well as
the modeled output for the water level sensor using system
matrices. We can observe that modeled output is very close
to sensor readings, resulting in small error(error is shown in
middle pane while it’s probability distribution is shown in
bottom pane).

is sampled and transmitted over a communication channel
(2). The received output ¯yk is used to compute control ac-
tions uk which are sent back to the process. Throughout
this control-loop, there are many potential points where an
attacker can hack into the system. For instance, man-in-the-
middle attacks at the communication channels and physical
attacks directly on the infrastructure. In this manuscript,
we focus on sensor and actuator attacks, which could be ac-
complished through a man-in-the-middle scheme and/or a
replacement of onboard PLC software with malware. Af-
ter each transmission and reception, the attacked output ¯yk
takes the form:
¯yk := yk + δk = Cxk + ηk + δk,
(2)
where δk ∈ Rm denotes sensor attacks. Throughout this
manuscript, we reserve the variable k as the discrete-time
index of various sequences; where clear, we omit reminding
the reader that k ∈ N.
2.2 Attack Detection Framework
In this section, we explain the details of our attack de-
tection scheme. First, we discuss the Kalman ﬁlter based
state estimation and residual generation. Then, we present
our residual-based attack detection procedures (namely the
CUSUM and Bad-Data detectors).
2.2.1 Kalman Filter
To estimate the state of the system based on the available
output yk, we use a linear ﬁlter with the following structure:
(cid:0)¯yk − C ˆxk
(cid:1),
ˆxk+1 = Aˆxk + Buk + Lk
(3)
with estimated state ˆxk ∈ Rn, ˆx1 = E[x(t1)], where E[· ]
denotes expectation, and gain matrix Lk ∈ Rn×m. Deﬁne
the estimation error ek := xk − ˆxk. In the Kalman ﬁlter,
the matrix Lk is designed to minimize the covariance matrix
Pk := E[ekeT
k ] (in the absence of attacks). Given the system
model (1),(2) and the estimator (3), the estimation error is
governed by the following diﬀerence equation
ek+1 =(cid:0)A − LkC(cid:1)ek − Lkηk − Lkδk + vk.
(4)
If the pair (A, C) is detectable, the covariance matrix con-
verges to steady state in the sense that limk→∞ Pk = P
exists [7]. We assume that the system has reached steady
state before an attack occurs. Then, the estimation of the
random sequence xk, k ∈ N can be obtained by the estimator
(3) with Pk and Lk in steady state. It can be veriﬁed that,
if R2 + CP C T is positive deﬁnite, the following estimator
gain
Lk = L :=(cid:0)AP C T(cid:1)(cid:0)R2 + CP C T(cid:1)−1,
(5)
leads to the minimal steady state covariance matrix P , with
