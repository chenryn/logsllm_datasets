environment.
Results. Figure 16 plots the time taken by robot A to navigate to
location X vs. the number of contending nodes when running Car-
Speak as well as the two 802.11 benchmarks. We observe that in a
network of over 6 contending wireless transmitters, CarSpeak per-
forms, on average, 2.4× better than the 802.11 baseline and 2.1×
better than 802.11’s MAC with CarSpeak’s multi-resolution nam-
ing system. In this network, 802.11 predominantly picks the incor-
rect path to the destination, while CarSpeak correctly picks the de-
tour at the intersection, with high probability. While, 802.11+Nam-
ing performs marginally better than 802.11 due to a more effective
compression scheme, its performance remains poor as much of the
available wireless bandwidth is used by other nodes, with sensor
information of much lower importance.
11.7 Safety
In this experiment, we evaluate CarSpeak’s effectiveness in im-
proving the safety of autonomous driving by detecting obstacles
outside the ﬁeld of view of the vehicle.
Method. Consider a topology of the robots as shown in ﬁgure
15(b) emulating the common scenario of vehicles at an intersection.
Robot A is navigating towards a T-intersection and seeks to merge
with other trafﬁc on the main roadway. Ideally, Robot A must yield
to Robot B (emulating a human-driven car without sensors), which
is currently traveling on the main road. However, Robot A’s sensors
have a limited ﬁeld of view and cannot detect Robot B. Negotiating
such intersections is one of the most challenging problems in de-
signing autonomous vehicles, often requiring human intervention
or additional information regarding obstacles on the road [7]. In
this topology, Robot C has access to sensor information capturing

Robot B. The network has several other robots contending for the
wireless medium, placed in randomly chosen locations. We evalu-
ate the ability of Robot A to detect Robot B, while implementing
CarSpeak against the 802.11 baseline implementations. We repeat
the experiment with different numbers of vehicles contending for
the medium in the environment.
Results. Figure 17 plots the percentage of successful detection
of Robot B vs. the number of wireless nodes contending for the
medium. While the performance of 802.11 and 802.11+Naming
deteriorate to as low as 6.1% and 11.9% as the number of robots
increases, CarSpeak successfully detects Robot B with 91% prob-
ability. In a network of over 6 transmitters, CarSpeak’s probabil-
ity of detecting Robot B is 14× that of 802.11 and 6.5× that of
802.11+Naming.
11.8 Outdoor Experiments on an Autonomous Vehicle
CarSpeak was implemented in an outdoor setting at a pedestrian
crosswalk in a campus-like environment. This pedestrian crosswalk
presents a hazardous setting where the two buildings on either side
of the crosswalk completely block the view such that vehicles on
the road are not aware of pedestrians before they emerge onto the
street. See Figure 9. We present empirical results demonstrating
CarSpeak’s capability of improving the stopping time of an au-
tonomous Yamaha G22E golf car over 802.11 when point cloud
sensor data for pedestrians in the vehicle’s blind spot is transmitted
to the vehicle. In particular, our results show that CarSpeak enables
the vehicle to make a stop decision before the crosswalk even at
full speeds, if a pedestrian appears when the vehicle is one to two
meters away from from the crosswalk.
Method. Our setup consists of a total of six Kinect sensors
placed adjacent to the pedestrian crosswalk, i.e., the vehicle blind
spot. The experiments were conducted in the presence of multi-
ple collision domains, and hidden terminals.4 Five out of six of
these Kinects are monitoring a different section of the environment
and thus are inconsequential for detecting pedestrians entering the
crosswalk. Only one of the Kinect sensors is strategically placed
to monitor the pedestrian crosswalk blind spot and thus obtains in-
formation relevant for the vehicle. Each Kinect broadcasts its point
cloud sensor information using the Asus netbook described in §10.
A receiver node on the autonomous golf car, a Vaio VPCF23BFX
laptop with an Intel Core 17-2670QM processor, processes the sen-
sor data that it receives from the Kinects to infer the presence of
a pedestrian in the critical region (i.e., vehicle blind spot) viewed
4Pairwise pings show that only a subset of the pairs can directly hear each
other, and in some pairs, the two nodes do not receive each other’s pings
though a third node can receive pings from both nodes, which indicates a
hidden terminal scenario.

tances on the x-axis are grouped into bins of two meters repre-

by the high priority Kinect. The pedestrian detection module issues
a positive reading if the number of point cloud data points within
the critical region is above a threshold of 1000 points. Upon de-
tecting the presence of the pedestrian, the receiver node immedi-
ately publishes a stop command to the golf car through a ROS pub-
lish/subscribe interface. We compare CarSpeak against the bench-
mark of the traditional 802.11 protocol for data transmission.
For the purposes of obtaining our performance metric, we make
the node attached to the Kinect log the sensor data to detect the ex-
act time when the pedestrian appears in the lobby in front of the
transmitting Kinect. This time is then compared against the times-
tamp of when the receiver issues a stop command to the vehicle.
Using the vehicle’s on-board localization paired with the two times-
tamps recorded, we also compare the distance of the vehicle from
the crosswalk when the pedestrian enters the crosswalk and when
the golf car is issued a stop command by the receiver. We note how-
ever, that processing is not necessary at the transmitter and is only
done for computing our performance metrics.
The golf car drives from 15 meters away towards the crosswalk.
We perform the experiment by allowing the pedestrian to enter the
crosswalk’s blind spot when the golf car is traveling at a full speed
of two meters per second at distances of roughly ten meters, eight
meters, six meters, four meters, and two meters from the crosswalk.
For all of our results we assume the pedestrian takes an additional
0.5 seconds to enter the crosswalk from the time he is detected at
the Kinect in the lobby and this is the time value we use on the x-
axis of our plots. The results of these experiments are averaged over
ﬁve runs for each of these distances using both CarSpeak and the
traditional 802.11 protocols and are compared in the next section.
Results. Our results, in Figure 18, show a clear improvement
in the vehicle’s ability to safely stop before the crosswalk using
CarSpeak as compared to 802.11. In particular CarSpeak allows
for the receiver to issue a stop command with a minimum average
delay of as little as 0.3 seconds from when the pedestrian appears
in the ﬁeld of view of the Kinect and a maximum average delay of
0.45 seconds. The maximum average delay of a positive pedestrian
detection using CarSpeak is 4.75 times smaller than the minimum
delay of 2.14s using 802.11.
These relatively small delays using CarSpeak allow the vehicle to
safely stop before the crosswalk even when it is one to two meters
away and traveling at a speed of two meters per second when the
pedestrian appears. Use of the traditional 802.11 protocol, however,
fails to stop the car before the crosswalk if a pedestrian appears
when the vehicle is closer than four meters from the crosswalk, on
average. See Figure 19. Using CarSpeak allows for a larger por-
tion of critical information requested by the golf car from the prior-
ity Kinect sensor to reach the receiver, whereas an 802.11 protocol
ﬂoods the receiver with proportionally more data from the irrelevant

Kinect sensors, inhibiting the receiver’s ability to process a posi-
tive pedestrian detection. In particular, using CarSpeak the receiver
obtains 7.5× as many pedestrian critical 3D points as 802.11, av-
eraged over twenty runs. Thus, using CarSpeak allows the receiver
to gain several folds more information about regions of the envi-
ronment that it considers important, even with several contending
non-relevant transmitters, allowing more timely usage of important
data to make critical decisions on actual autonomous vehicles.
12. CONCLUSION
This paper introduces CarSpeak, a content-centric communica-
tion system for autonomous driving, enabling cars to query and ac-
cess sensory information captured by other cars in a manner similar
to how they access information from their local sensors. Field tests
using a combination of iRobot robots and a Yamaha instrumented
car show that, in comparison with a baseline that directly uses
802.11, CarSpeak improves safety, increases information through-
put, and provides several folds reduction in the time to navigate an
obstacle-ridden environment.
