titleblackhat:us-22 In Need of &#39;Pair&#39; Review: Vulnerable Code Contributions by GitHub Copilot
On June 29 in 2021 GitHub announced and released their newest tool, 'Copilot' - an 'AI-based Pair Programmer', a deep learning model trained over vast quantities of open-source GitHub code.  However, we humans wrote most of that code. And much of it isn't great. It has bugs, it contains dated coding practices, and many repositories even contain dangerously insecure code. Given the vast quantity of garbage code that Copilot has learned from, is it reasonable to trust the code suggestions that it generates? In this talk, we demonstrate that GitHub Copilot is susceptible to writing vulnerabilities in multiple axis, from SQL injections to buffer overflows, use-after-free to cryptographic issues. We try different languages - C, Python, and even Verilog, where we show it also generates hardware bugs (when it can generate hardware at all).Overall, we tried 89 different scenarios for Copilot, generating 1,689 suggestions, and found approximately 40% to be vulnerable.
