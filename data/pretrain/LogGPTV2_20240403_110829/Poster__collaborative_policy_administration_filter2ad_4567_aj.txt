DSH proposals involving co-production and bottom-
up social innovation were not immediately or entirely 
embraced by the agency. Certain aspects of co-
production were eventually incorporated into the pilot 
proposals, but within the limits of existing parameters. 
For example, proposals in which co-production 
was directed at reorienting relationships between 
stakeholders in the affordable housing services 
landscape (i.e. supporting new forms of collaboration 
between tenants and landlords), did not fall directly

In this article the authors reflect on the barriers faced by designers 
when designing for social innovation in the public sector. These 
reflections does not include the opinion of public staff participants, 
who might have felt equally challenged by the design process 
proposed by the Public & Collaborative team.
8  The term ‘user-centered design’ was coined by Donald Norman at 
the University of California San Diego to describe design processes 
in which the needs of end-users influence the design of a product 
or service. The term and design approach enjoyed a surge of 
popularity after the publication of the books User-Centered System 
Design: New Perspectives on Human-Computer Interaction (Norman 
& Draper, 1986) and The Design of Everyday Things (Norman, 1988)
9  This article refers to the participatory design approach as described 
in the Scandinavian tradition, in terms of early experiments 
with employing computers to emancipate workers in their work 
environment (Ehn, 1989).
10 According to David Boyle, a fellow at the New Economics 
Foundation in London, co-production means delivering public 
services through an equal and reciprocal relationship between 
professionals, people using services, their families, and their 
neighbors. Where activities are co-produced in this way, both 
services and communities become far more effective agents of 
change.

within the agency’s current mandate or practices. In 
retrospect, it is clear that the presentation, negotiation 
and reception of these ideas constituted moments 
of contestation, wherein design is an explicitly 
political act. Design becomes a political act precisely 
because it is a set of practices and procedures which 
directly challenge the established order. It represents 
a moment of contestation, not only through the 
promotion of new ideas and policies, but by the very 
processes in which such ideas are produced.
2.2 Overcoming Epistemological Barriers 
“Overcoming the distinction between quantitative and 
qualitative forms of knowledge is politically radical, 
as well as epistemologically radical. Breaking out of 
methodological scientific procedures may also mean 
breaking out of organisational routines that constrain 
power.” (Davies, 2011)
The DSH project was conceived as an inherently 
interdisciplinary endeavor meant to bring together 
designers (represented by Parsons students and Public 
Policy Lab fellows), agency leadership (with different 
backgrounds including strategic planning, marketing, 
and urban development policy) and front-line staff 
into a collaborative space. Within this space, the 
different project participants brought to the table 
different disciplinary viewpoints and approaches to 
improving New York City’s affordable housing-related 
services11. Designers typically operate as experts in 
experimentation, coming up with a wide array of 
proposals in a short period of time. Design’s mode 
of operation is heuristic and iterative (where failure 
during the process is expected and embraced), and it 
lays a heavy emphasis on ‘innovation’. While agency 
partners certainly maintained a positive view of the 
value of design – particularly with respect to its 
potential to identify and fix service inefficiencies, 
as well to improve the style and usability of ‘touch-
points’ (i.e. posters and websites) – the role of designer 
as a catalyst for social innovation and institutional 
change was not always embraced. Design proposals 
11 Public Policy Lab’s fellows included designers from different 
academic and professional backgrounds such as an experience 
designer with a focus on participatory design and systems thinking; 
a service designer specialized in social-sector clients; an expert 
in public-engagement strategy, and an urban planner with a focus 
on community-based design. Design students in the Integrated 
Design Program (BFA) and the Transdisciplinary Design Program 
(MFA) at Parsons were involved in the first phase of the project. 
Both academic programs emphasize the use of service design and 
participatory tools and methods to engage multiple stakeholders in 
addressing pressing social issues.
that sought to discuss and expand policy into areas 
outside existing mandates were often constrained by 
legal infrastructure which places strict limitations on 
the speed and scale in which new policy ideas may be 
experimented with or implemented.
One such proposal recommended that affordable 
housing developers and property managers actively 
facilitate social networks and collaborative services 
within their buildings in order to help residents 
recognize each other for mutual support and foster a

greater sense of connection and belonging throughout 
their community. While this concept appeared 
compatible with HPD’s interests in “strengthening 
neighborhoods” and “stabilizing families” (HPD, 2010), 
the designer’s proposed methods for achieving such 
goals differed significantly from the agency’s existing 
policy mechanisms. Although this proposal was 
designed to further HPD’s goals and social mission, 
the rational for such an approach fell outside of 
existing frameworks for validating strategic decisions 
and policy proposals. Previous studies on policy 
innovation reinforce this perception by suggesting 
that modern bureaucracies “often struggle to 
make space for engagement with uncertainty” and 
operate within a highly rationalistic, economized 
epistemological framework (Davies, 2011). The DSH 
project verified that agencies’, governments’, and policy 
makers’ ‘economistic’ approach to problem solving 
tends to value new ideas by weighing them against 
quantitative metrics for an initiative’s likelihood of 
success. The rapid experiments, ad hoc iterations, and 
speculative narratives that designers commonly use 
to justify their ideas simply do not carry the same 
weight as  rigorous surveying and economic data in 
the eyes of most public administrators. Both previous 
research on policy innovation experts and the 
32
observations made during the DSH project confirm 
that the requirements necessary for bureaucratic 
institutions to incorporate new forms of change often 
fall outside the capabilities of designers. In meetings 
where proposals were presented to agency staff 
that emphasized social innovations outside existing 
service structures, the designers often lacked the 
‘epistemological authority’ to convey the validity of 
their ideas to agency partners. 
Both designers and policy makers are expected 
to demonstrate particular forms of expertise; but 
paradoxically such demonstrations of expertise 
can actually prevent the very real work required to 
translate policy intentions into political realities. For 
instance, a designer could be asked by agency staff 
to ‘do the design’ for a set of policy goals; this is 
not the same as designers working with citizens to 
envision better societies. If design practices are to be 
a catalyst for social innovation in the public sector, 
then it is imperative to further explore the possibility 
of creating platforms or spaces in which different 
epistemic communities may work together without 
reproducing hierarchical power relations where one 
form of knowledge and practice is valued more highly 
than another.
2.3 Managing Risk Aversion 
“The practitioner allows himself to experience surprise, 
puzzlement, or confusion in a situation which he finds 
uncertain or unique. He reflects on the phenomenon 
before him, and on the prior understandings which 
have been implicit in his behavior. He carries out 
an experiment which serves to generate both a new 
understanding of the phenomenon and a change in the 
situation.” (Schön, 1983) 
The risks associated with communicating new ideas 
and proposals must be taken into account when 
designing for social innovation with public-sector 
partners. Especially when discussing and promoting 
more disruptive, or transformative proposals, designers 
need to be aware of the unique constraints that 
government agencies face in exploring, entertaining, 
and implementing new ideas. By acting in the 
public sphere, agency managers and staff are held 
publicly accountable for their actions and for their 
use of taxpayers’ money. For this reason, strict 
communications protocols (both internal and external) 
may inhibit the exchange of ideas and discourage 
33
participants of a design project from taking the risks 
necessary to be truly innovative.
The various ideas, activities, and outcomes of the DSH 
project were subject to different constraints depending 
on their audience – be it the design team, agency 
partners, or the general public. The more people that 
proposals and interventions were potentially exposed 
to, the greater the limitations that were imposed upon 
them. As concepts moved from the design studio to the 
agency conference room and into the public domain, 
they were naturally subjected to increasingly rigorous 
editorial scrutiny and legal restriction.
In the studio, designers often encourage divergent 
thinking and expansive ideation in order to maximize 
the exploration and exchange of new ideas. In the 
conference room, an atmosphere of free and frank 
discussion may also be cultivated, but ideas must 
be articulated in ways that do not unduly criticize 
an agency’s existing policies or unfairly overlook 
its inherent limitations. In public documents and 
FIGURE 3: Layout of the “How-To Guide” cover. 
The presence of agency’s logo in the cover was 
contingent on the approval of all ideas and language 
consolidated by HPD’s legal and communications staff.
interactions associated with the agency, new ideas 
must be thoroughly vetted and edited to ensure 
that they do not create false expectations, unequal 
opportunities, or conflicts of interest among individual 
constituents or institutional partners.
Since innovation in the public realm is intended for 
everyone, it cannot be seen to alienate anyone. Unlike 
the private corporation, which is obligated to act solely 
in the interest of its shareholders, a public-sector 
institution is obligated to act equally in the interest of 
all its constituents. As a result, the work of designers 
partnering with government agencies is held to 
a higher standard of public accountability. In this 
environment designers should expect agencies’ legal 
and communications departments to work closely with 
design team in developing concepts for the public and 
authorizing them for public consumption.
The DSH team grappled with the complexities of 
involving the public in their work well before any of 
their proposals were ready to be discussed publicly. 
Design research methods involving public participants 
or private partners had to be routinely vetted by 
the agency. The design team’s decision to produce 
and publish a “How-To Guide” (figure 3), illustrating 
the project’s development and detailing proposals 
intended for piloting by the agency, presented 
additional challenges. Publishing concepts before 
conducting prototyping emphasized editing over 
experimentation and placed legal and communications 
procedures before the design process. 
This experience demonstrates how untested ideas 
risk being evaluated on the basis of how they 
might be perceived rather than how they actually 
perform. ‘Visioning’ and scenario building – design 
approaches intended to explore new possibilities 
in order to prompt strategic conversations among 
stakeholders – risk being interpreted as “speculative” 
or “condescending” for presuming too much about 
current procedures and future possibilities, and they 
may be just as likely to offend public managers as 
inspire them.
Successful innovation in public services must 
ultimately recognize the challenges of public 
accountability. Designers and agency staff are wise 
to think strategically about how and when to involve 
the public in their work. This requires a delicate 
balance that can be hard to achieve and manage. 
The Bloomberg administration, for instance, has been 
criticized for its so-called pilot programs – essentially 
a “do it first; ask questions later” approach. For some, 
these pilots are innovative ways to skip public-
sector red tape, and for others they are a “tool that 
undermines democracy by minimizing the public’s role 
in scrutinizing the ideas of government”12.

IMPLICATIONS FOR
35
DESIGN PRACTICE
Although the overall design agenda is growing within governments (with a prevalent 
focus on the design of ‘apps’ or digital platforms to increase government transparency), 
participatory design, service design, and designing for social innovation in the public 
sector are still emerging practices in the United States. As discussed in this article, 
designing for social innovation cannot be merely an exercise of consultation or placing 
the user at the center of the design process. Designing in this context is mostly about 
creating meaningful mechanisms of public participation. As a result, designers must 
acknowledge the complex political environment in which their work is situated. They 
would also do well to examen the landscape and existing processes which facilitate 
public participation in governance. The application of participatory methods and 
involving final users in the delivery of public services must be carefully examined. 
The aims of consultation, participation, co-design, and co-production can be easily 
distorted, and the use of these strategies – what Barbara Cruikshank (1999) calls 
“technologies of citizenship” – can expose problematic political and power relations. 
The design community needs to shift the discussion focused on user-centered methods 
towards a political commitment to participatory and democratic processes.
Designers pursuing social innovation in the public sector must also carefully 
consider how to position their projects in relation to government agencies, 
community partners, and private individuals, so as to maintain their own autonomy 
and legitimacy without losing the participation, trust, and enthusiasm of all 
stakeholders. As stressed above, in asserting their epistemological authority within 
hierarchical, bureaucratic policy making environments, designers will be subjected 
to increasingly rigorous scrutiny. Therefore, they must adapt their language and tools 
in ways that are more legible to their public partners and community collaborators. 
Further comparison and analysis is necessary to determine when and why designers 
are best served by working within, along side, or outside of government agencies.
DESIGN EDUCATION
The DESIS Network’s Public & Collaborative Thematic Cluster initiative is one 
example of how universities and design schools around the world are trying to 
create different opportunities for students and faculty to engage with a multiplicity 
of public and community partners. Exposure to these kinds of project situations is 
fundamental to the development of future designers’ capacity to work collaboratively 
and engage in cooperative processes. 
The DSH project in particular, revealed that designers must learn how to better 
communicate with public-sector managers and at the same time retain their 
authority to intervene and add value to a field that often resists the kinds of 
uncertainty and speculative thinking that characterize design practice. In this sense, 
it is essential to nurture pedagogical spaces that enhance the ability of design 
students to interact with other fields and disciplines, such as the social sciences, 
management, and public policy.
Although the market for design services in the public sector is expanding (with 
companies like IDEO, Reboot, and others steadily expanding the field) there is a 
lack of a strong professional and academic tradition around service design in the 
United States. Consequently, there is not much of a culture or familiarity with 
design-led innovation processes within public agencies. As a result, there are few 
internships or other opportunities for design students to gain experience working 
in this space. One way to address this issue is for universities’ career service offices 
to consider establishing relationships with public agencies and to guide design 
students in pursuing careers in the public sector.
To strengthen the professional authority and credibility of designers working 
to effect change in the public realm, universities should continue to promote 
public events, stimulate research initiatives and foster strategic alliances with 
public agencies in order to build a more robust academic knowledge base in this 
emerging field.
PUBLIC-SECTOR MANAGERS AND POLICY MAKERS
Public-sector managers and policy makers are beholden to practical and political 
constraints, which can make experimentation with new ideas – even desirable 
ones – difficult and/or impossible. If public-sector managers and policy makers 
are interested in experimenting with new ideas, one approach could be to create 
semi-autonomous spaces for collaboration, or what Christian Bason has referred 
to as “authorizing environments” (Bason, 2013). Supported by a specific agency, 
organization, or community, these spaces could serve as both exploratory and 
experimental sites for working towards innovative solutions to public problems 
(i.e. affordable housing, education, healthcare, etc). They could be dedicated to the 
creation of networks and partnerships; launching projects, events, and platforms. 
Such spaces would bring together a variety of actors, both public and private, 
with a diverse array of skill sets and expertise around a set of issues. They would 
provide a degree of freedom from many of the innovative constraints of partner-
specific mandates, policy issues, and procedural restrictions. 
While remaining semi-autonomous and allowing innovators to freely explore new 
forms and create new knowledge, these spaces could still be supported by the 
larger institutional bodies whose services, practices, interests stand to benefit from 
such collaborative work. How the output of these spaces is evaluated and adopted 
would ultimately be up to the specific agencies, organizations, or communities 
that house them. However, the idea is to proliferate such spaces so that they may 
(1) work experimentally and freely using design as a instrument for advancing 
innovation in the public sector/realm, and (2) be collaboratively integrated with all 
interested parties at every step of the process in order to maximize the potential 
for innovation and new ideas to emerge.
