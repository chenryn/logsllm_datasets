### DSH Proposals and Co-Production

The proposals for co-production and bottom-up social innovation in the DSH (Design for Social Housing) project were not immediately or entirely embraced by the agency. While certain aspects of co-production were eventually incorporated into the pilot proposals, they were limited by existing parameters. For example, proposals that aimed to reorient relationships between stakeholders in the affordable housing services landscape—such as fostering new forms of collaboration between tenants and landlords—did not align with the agency's current mandate or practices.

In retrospect, it is clear that the presentation, negotiation, and reception of these ideas constituted moments of contestation, where design became an explicitly political act. Design challenges the established order, not only through the promotion of new ideas and policies but also through the processes by which such ideas are produced.

### Overcoming Epistemological Barriers

"Overcoming the distinction between quantitative and qualitative forms of knowledge is politically radical, as well as epistemologically radical. Breaking out of methodological scientific procedures may also mean breaking out of organizational routines that constrain power." (Davies, 2011)

The DSH project was conceived as an interdisciplinary endeavor, bringing together designers (represented by Parsons students and Public Policy Lab fellows), agency leadership (with backgrounds in strategic planning, marketing, and urban development policy), and front-line staff into a collaborative space. Each participant brought different disciplinary viewpoints and approaches to improving New York City’s affordable housing-related services.

Designers typically operate as experts in experimentation, generating a wide array of proposals in a short period. Their mode of operation is heuristic and iterative, embracing failure as part of the process and emphasizing innovation. While agency partners recognized the value of design, particularly in identifying and fixing service inefficiencies and improving the style and usability of touchpoints (e.g., posters and websites), the role of the designer as a catalyst for social innovation and institutional change was not always fully embraced.

Proposals that sought to expand policy into areas outside existing mandates were often constrained by legal infrastructure, which places strict limitations on the speed and scale at which new policy ideas can be experimented with or implemented. For instance, one proposal recommended that affordable housing developers and property managers facilitate social networks and collaborative services within their buildings to foster a greater sense of connection and belonging among residents. Although this concept aligned with HPD’s goals of "strengthening neighborhoods" and "stabilizing families," the proposed methods differed significantly from the agency’s existing policy mechanisms. The rationale for this approach fell outside the existing frameworks for validating strategic decisions and policy proposals.

Previous studies on policy innovation suggest that modern bureaucracces often struggle to engage with uncertainty and operate within a highly rationalistic, economized epistemological framework (Davies, 2011). The DSH project confirmed that public agencies, governments, and policymakers tend to value new ideas based on quantitative metrics for success. The rapid experiments, ad hoc iterations, and speculative narratives that designers use to justify their ideas do not carry the same weight as rigorous surveying and economic data in the eyes of most public administrators.

### Managing Risk Aversion

"The practitioner allows himself to experience surprise, puzzlement, or confusion in a situation which he finds uncertain or unique. He reflects on the phenomenon before him, and on the prior understandings which have been implicit in his behavior. He carries out an experiment which serves to generate both a new understanding of the phenomenon and a change in the situation." (Schön, 1983)

When designing for social innovation with public-sector partners, the risks associated with communicating new ideas and proposals must be considered. Especially when promoting more disruptive or transformative proposals, designers need to be aware of the unique constraints that government agencies face in exploring, entertaining, and implementing new ideas. Agency managers and staff are held publicly accountable for their actions and use of taxpayers’ money, leading to strict communication protocols that may inhibit the exchange of ideas and discourage risk-taking.

The DSH project faced different constraints depending on the audience—be it the design team, agency partners, or the general public. As concepts moved from the design studio to the agency conference room and into the public domain, they were subjected to increasingly rigorous editorial scrutiny and legal restrictions. In the studio, designers encourage divergent thinking and expansive ideation, while in the conference room, ideas must be articulated in ways that do not unduly criticize the agency’s existing policies or overlook its inherent limitations. In public documents and interactions, new ideas must be thoroughly vetted and edited to ensure they do not create false expectations, unequal opportunities, or conflicts of interest.

### Conclusion

Building on reflections from this case study, this article highlights the implications of designing for social innovation in the public sector and offers recommendations for designers, educators, civil servants, and policymakers. Designing for social innovation cannot be merely an exercise of consultation or placing the user at the center of the design process; it is about creating meaningful mechanisms of public participation. Designers must acknowledge the complex political environment in which their work is situated and carefully examine the landscape and existing processes that facilitate public participation in governance.

Designers pursuing social innovation in the public sector must consider how to position their projects in relation to government agencies, community partners, and private individuals, maintaining their autonomy and legitimacy without losing the participation, trust, and enthusiasm of all stakeholders. They must adapt their language and tools to be more legible to their public partners and community collaborators.

### Implications for Design Practice

While the overall design agenda is growing within governments, participatory design, service design, and designing for social innovation in the public sector are still emerging practices in the United States. The design community needs to shift the discussion from user-centered methods towards a political commitment to participatory and democratic processes. Designers must carefully consider how to position their projects in relation to government agencies, community partners, and private individuals to maintain their autonomy and legitimacy.

### Design Education

The DESIS Network’s Public & Collaborative Thematic Cluster initiative is an example of how universities and design schools are creating opportunities for students and faculty to engage with a multiplicity of public and community partners. Exposure to these project situations is fundamental to developing future designers' capacity to work collaboratively and engage in cooperative processes. The DSH project revealed that designers must learn to better communicate with public-sector managers while retaining their authority to intervene and add value. It is essential to nurture pedagogical spaces that enhance the ability of design students to interact with other fields and disciplines, such as the social sciences, management, and public policy.

### Public-Sector Managers and Policymakers

Public-sector managers and policymakers are beholden to practical and political constraints, making experimentation with new ideas difficult or impossible. One approach could be to create semi-autonomous spaces for collaboration, or what Christian Bason has referred to as "authorizing environments" (Bason, 2013). These spaces, supported by specific agencies, organizations, or communities, could serve as exploratory and experimental sites for innovative solutions to public problems. They would bring together a variety of actors, both public and private, with diverse skill sets and expertise around a set of issues, providing a degree of freedom from many of the innovative constraints of partner-specific mandates, policy issues, and procedural restrictions.
