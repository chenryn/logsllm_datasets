User: How to manage processes in Linux system? Please provide a set of shell commands for viewing, killing, and backgrounding processes.
Assistant: Process management is a very important part of the Linux system. Administrators need to monitor, maintain and adjust the processes in the system. The following is a set of Shell commands for process management in the Linux system: 1. View processes: use the ps command to view the running processes in the system. Commonly used ps command options are as follows: - aux: view all running processes; - u: view processes based on users; - x: view processes that are not running as a terminal. Example command: ``` ps aux # View all running processes ps u -C sshd # View detailed information of the process named sshd``` 2. Kill the process: use the kill command to kill one or more processes. Commonly used kill command options are as follows: - -9 (or -kill): Forcefully kill the process; - -s: Specify the signal used when killing the process. Example command: ``` kill -9 1234 #Forcibly kill the process with PID 1234 kill -s HUP 1234 #Send a HUP signal to the process with PID 1234 killall -9 nginx #Forcibly kill all processes named nginx`` ` 3. Background process: use the & symbol to put the process into the background. Example command: ``` ping 127.0.0.1 & # Run the ping command in the background nohup ping 127.0.0.1 & # Run the ping command in the background in nohup mode ``` The above are common shell commands for process management in Linux systems, administrators You can adjust and combine them according to your specific needs.
