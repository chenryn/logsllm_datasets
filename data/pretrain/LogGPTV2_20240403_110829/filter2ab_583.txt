### Title: Unsafe at Any Speed: CISA's Plan to Foster Tech Ecosystem Security

In 1965, Ralph Nader published "Unsafe at Any Speed," a groundbreaking book that examined automobile safety from design to delivery and maintenance. The parallels between the safety issues in the automotive industry and those in modern technology are striking. In this talk, we will explore how products can be designed and built to be inherently safe, covering topics such as memory safety, open-source security, insurance, and the security poverty line.

We will also delve into CISA's comprehensive strategy to foster a safer technology ecosystem. This strategy includes working with technology manufacturers to secure commitments to build more secure products, ensuring that smaller organizations can demand better security from their vendors, and educating the next generation of software developers about the importance of security.

Achieving a safer technology ecosystem is a collective effort, and we need your help to make it a reality. Join us as we discuss these critical issues and work together to create a more secure future.
