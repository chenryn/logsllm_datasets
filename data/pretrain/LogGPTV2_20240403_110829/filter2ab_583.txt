titleblackhat:us-23 Unsafe At Any Speed: CISA's Plan to Foster Tech Ecosystem Security
In 1965, Ralph Nader published "Unsafe at Any Speed", a survey of automobile safety from design, to delivery, to maintenance. The parallels to the safety of modern technology are startling. In this talk, we'll explore how products can be built to be safe by design, and safe by default, including topics ranging from memory safety, open-source security, insurance, and the security poverty line. As part of this, we'll detail CISA's strategy to foster a safer technology ecosystem. This spans from working with tech manufacturers to get commitments to build more secure products, to ensuring that smaller organizations are able to demand better security from their vendors and educating the next generation of software developers to understand security. We cannot do this alone and need your help to get it right!
