Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
 The biggest priority for Texas is to establish a 
statewide network of interoperable radio systems 
by January 2007.  All jurisdictions/regions within 
the state must reach level-four interoperability by 
January 2007, and all future communications 
equipment must meet those standards as well.  Level-four interoperability 
means that all disciplines can go anywhere in the state and have 
immediate radio communications with each other using their own equipment on established 
channels.  The interoperability is being tested during the real-life wildfires currently taking place 
across the state, will also be tested during the statewide hurricane exercise scheduled in May, and 
will be incorporated into all future exercises conducted within the state. 
Another interoperable communications project in the state is the purchase and use of the 
WebEOC system.  While it is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged and is being utilized by 
many of the large cities throughout the state.  The WebEOC system is server-based and allows 
electronic collaboration between 
the EOCs, including posting of 
emergency operations plans 
(EOPs) and sharing of situation 
reports (SITREPS).  It allows 
users to see what other EOCs 
are doing, and the information is 
available much quicker using 
the system.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
The State EOC is working on the capacity to receive streaming video and audio 
feeds from on scene units engaged in crisis response.  This inexpensive use of 
current technology would provide State and Federal officials the ability to ensure 
seamless response and recovery efforts across multiple jurisdictions.   
The system is fully scalable and can be up-linked to multiple state or federal 
command centers where communications bridges have been created.  The State continues to 
focus energies on broadening this significant capability through multiple funding streams.   
In order to create this level of interoperability, the Utah Department of Public Safety is focusing 
technology development resources on three major areas. The first area is the integration of voice 
communications between all agencies in the state. Network integration is the second area where 
development resources are being used. Data sharing between the different agencies in the state is 
the third area of focus.  
The voice and network 
integration projects are the top 
priority of the state and consume 
the majority of the resources 
allocated to the state under 
department of homeland security 
grants. With current levels of 
funding, completion of the data-
sharing project is at least two 
years away. If the proposed 
project is funded the whole 
system could serve as a model

Utah is the Interim Co-Chair of the Four Corners Homeland Security Coalition.  The State Co-
Chairs the Coalition of four states (Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona), 15 Local 
Counties and ultimately 22 tribes within the Four Corners Region.  The first priority of the 
Coalition is to expand interoperable communications to ensure full integration of all jurisdictions 
in this overlap area.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
Vermont invested approximately $9m of State funds to bolster existing public safety 
radio communications by installing a new digital microwave network and upgraded 
the Vermont State Police (VSP) two-way radio system and mobile data network 
Vermont has invested in a variety of solutions to support interoperability within the 
State which include the provision of command radios in Fire, EMS and Vermont 
State Police vehicles, as well as new towers, repeaters, and dispatch consoles.   
Approximately 90% of all local and State law enforcement agencies in Vermont can 
communicate by “flipping” a switch on their mobile radios.  Vermont State Police (VSP) has the 
ability to communicate with emergency medical and fire services from their cruisers and four 
dispatch centers.  Over 50% of these first responders have the ability to communicate with the 
VSP dispatch centers.   
In May 2006, Vermont will 
activate its Statewide web-
enabled virtual Emergency 
Operation Center system.  This 
interoperable communication 
system will allow the State to 
share data, gather instant 
situational awareness, tie into 
HSIN, and communicate with 
first responder agencies and 
state agencies during events.

The Territory of the US Virgin Islands continues to build out its 
interoperable communications infrastructure including Government 
Wide Area Network (GWAN) which will provide data connectivity 
and satellite based voice communications for first responder 
agencies. With the islands as much as 40 miles apart, completion of 
this system will ensure a secure communications capability for 
response activities. The Territory has already deployed several 
communications vehicles that can establish voice and data 
communications on each of the islands within one hour of an 
incident.
