There appears to be an issue with the challenge located at [http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/bonfire-return-largest-numbers-in-arrays](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/bonfire-return-largest-numbers-in-arrays).

Upon attempting to solve the challenge, the compiler returns the error: "cannot read property 'eql' of undefined". This is confusing because I have not defined or used a property named 'eql' in my code. Regardless of any changes I make in the editor, the same error message persists. 

Could you please look into this?
