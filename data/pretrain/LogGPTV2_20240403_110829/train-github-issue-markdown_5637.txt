Hi,  
The following code works in version 1.2, but leads to an exception in version
1.3:
    >>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(range(10), color='none')
    >>> plt.show()
I think the issue boils down to this commit: `edc48f0`
I'm not sure whether this was an intentional change. Thanks!
