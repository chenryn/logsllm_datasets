Subject: Issue with `color='none'` in matplotlib version 1.3

Hi,

I have encountered an issue where the following code, which works in version 1.2, raises an exception in version 1.3:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.plot(range(10), color='none')
plt.show()
```

After some investigation, I believe the problem may be related to this commit: `edc48f0`.

Could you please confirm whether this change was intentional? If so, is there a recommended alternative for achieving the same effect in version 1.3?

Thank you!

Best regards,
