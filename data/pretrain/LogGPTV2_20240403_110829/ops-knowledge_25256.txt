User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is there a way to permanently set the font and window size in putty? When I log in with putty, I always have to:


change settings
appearance
font
change
8
resize window


so that I can see enough text to work with the log files. 

I don't see where I can save these settings to my saved session, is this possible?





Answer:

So the answer is click on change settings, change everything but then you have to also click on session the name again and save, thanks david:

Assistant: You need to go &quot;Change Settings -&gt; Window&quot; and set it there.
Do the same under Appearance for the font and size.

Then go back to the session and save it.
