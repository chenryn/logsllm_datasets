**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Execution Prevention

To prevent the execution of unauthorized or potentially malicious applications, implement application control measures. This is particularly important for tools that are not part of the organization's approved security policies, such as rootkit removal tools, which can be misused to compromise system defenses. Ensure that only approved and trusted security applications are installed and running on enterprise systems. Regularly review and update the list of approved applications to maintain a robust security posture.
