**User:** I want to update my Python 2.6.1 to 3.x on my Mac, but I'm wondering if it's possible to do this using the Terminal, or if I have to download the installer from the Python website. The reason I'm asking is that the installer is not updating the Python version in my Terminal.

**Assistant:** You can indeed update Python using the Terminal. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Check the Current Version:**
   First, check which version of Python is currently installed by running:
   ```sh
   python --version
   python3 --version
   ```

2. **Install Homebrew (if you don't have it already):**
   Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install and manage software. To install Homebrew, open your Terminal and run:
   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. **Install Python 3 Using Homebrew:**
   Once Homebrew is installed, you can use it to install the latest version of Python 3:
   ```sh
   brew install python
   ```

4. **Verify the Installation:**
   After the installation, verify that Python 3 is correctly installed by running:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```

5. **Update the Default Python Version (Optional):**
   If you want to make `python` point to Python 3 instead of Python 2, you can create an alias or use a version manager like `pyenv`. To create an alias, add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`):
   ```sh
   alias python=python3
   ```
   Then, reload the configuration:
   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to update Python and ensure that the Terminal uses the correct version. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance.
