User: I wanted to update my python 2.6.1 to 3.x on mac but i was wondering if its possible to do it using terminal or i have to download the installer from python website? 
The reason why i am asking this question is because installer is not updating my terminal python version.
Assistant: You can do it from Terminal too. It's quite easy. You just need to type python3 --version and
