User: Does anyone know how I would go about detected what bit version Windows is under Python.  I need to know this as a way of using the right folder for Program Files.
Many thanks
Assistant: There should be a directory under Windows 64bit, a Folder called \Windows\WinSxS64 for 64 bit, under Windows 32bit, it's WinSxS.
