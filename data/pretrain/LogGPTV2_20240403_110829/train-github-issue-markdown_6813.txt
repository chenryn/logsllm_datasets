### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
Running `npm config set` expands all environment variables in `.npmrc`,
permanently.
The documentation says you can do this:
> All npm config files are an ini-formatted list of key = value parameters.
> Environment variables can be replaced using ${VARIABLE_NAME}. For example:
>  
>  
>     prefix = ${HOME}/.npm-packages
>  
However if you do this, it gets expanded permanently the first time you run
`npm config`:
    $ cat .npmrc
    prefix = ${HOME}/.npm-packages
    $ npm config set dummy=true --location=project
    $ cat .npmrc
    prefix = /home/example/.npm-packages
    dummy=true
### Expected Behavior
Environment variables in `.npmrc` should be left alone. They are often
placeholders for things like authentication tokens for private repositories,
so replacing them with the current value is undesirable and breaks
functionality.
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. `echo 'prefix = ${HOME}/.npm-packages' >> .npmrc`
  2. `cat .npmrc`
  3. Confirm `${HOME}` is contained in the file
  4. `npm config set dummy=true --location=project`
  5. `cat .npmrc`
  6. Observe `${HOME}` has been replaced with the current user's actual home directory.
### Environment
  * npm: 8.18.0
  * Node.js: 18.4.0
  * OS Name: Arch Linux
