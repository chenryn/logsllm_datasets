    Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
    [✓] Flutter (Channel beta, v0.8.2, on Mac OS X 10.13.6 17G65, locale en-ID)
    [✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 27.0.3)
    [!] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 10.0)
        ! CocoaPods out of date (1.5.0 is recommended).
            CocoaPods is used to retrieve the iOS platform side's plugin code that responds to your plugin usage on the Dart side.
            Without resolving iOS dependencies with CocoaPods, plugins will not work on iOS.
            For more info, see https://flutter.io/platform-plugins
          To upgrade:
            brew upgrade cocoapods
            pod setup
    [✓] Android Studio (version 3.0)
    [!] VS Code (version 1.27.2)
