Today, after updating Xcode to version 10.0, I encountered issues when attempting to run my application project. The error message is as follows:

**Xcode's Output:**
```
error: Multiple commands produce '/Users/lumos/Office/Git Project/ios/tanamduit-ios-app/tanamduit-app-ios/build/ios/Debug-iphoneos/Runner.app/Frameworks/Flutter.framework':

Prior to updating Xcode, the project was running without any issues. Here is the output from `flutter doctor`:

**Flutter Doctor Summary:**
```
[✓] Flutter (Channel beta, v0.8.2, on Mac OS X 10.13.6 17G65, locale en-ID)
[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 27.0.3)
[!] iOS toolchain - develop for iOS devices (Xcode 10.0)
    ! CocoaPods out of date (1.5.0 is recommended).
        CocoaPods is used to retrieve the iOS platform side's plugin code that responds to your plugin usage on the Dart side.
        Without resolving iOS dependencies with CocoaPods, plugins will not work on iOS.
        For more information, see https://flutter.io/platform-plugins
      To upgrade:
        brew upgrade cocoapods
        pod setup

[✓] Android Studio (version 3.0)
[!] VS Code (version 1.27.2)
[✓] Connected devices (3 available)

```

The main issue appears to be related to the multiple commands producing the same output file and the outdated CocoaPods version. I need to resolve these issues to get my project running again.
