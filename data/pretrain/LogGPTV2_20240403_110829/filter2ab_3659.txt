**ATT&CK ID:** T1584.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Virtual Private Server

Adversaries may compromise third-party Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) as part of their operational infrastructure. Many cloud service providers offer virtual machines or containers as a service, which can be attractive targets for malicious actors. By compromising VPSs that are owned by third parties, adversaries can obscure the physical and digital trail leading back to their own operations. This makes it challenging for investigators to attribute attacks to the true source, thus providing a layer of anonymity and operational security.
