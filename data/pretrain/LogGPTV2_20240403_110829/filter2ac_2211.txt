**ATT&CK ID:** T1021  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Remote Services

Adversaries may exploit valid account credentials to log into services that accept remote connections, such as Telnet, SSH, and VNC. Once authenticated, the adversary can perform actions with the privileges of the logged-on user.

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Remote Services**: These include protocols and applications that allow users to connect and interact with a system from a remote location.
- **Valid Accounts**: Credentials that are legitimate and have been compromised or otherwise obtained by the adversary.
- **Actions Performed**: The adversary can execute commands, transfer files, and perform other activities as if they were the legitimate user, potentially leading to further compromise or data exfiltration.

This technique is commonly used in various stages of an attack, including initial access, lateral movement, and persistence.
