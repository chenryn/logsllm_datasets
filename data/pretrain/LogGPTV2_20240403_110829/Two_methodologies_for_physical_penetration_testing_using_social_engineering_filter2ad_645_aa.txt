ABSTRACT
Penetration tests on IT systems are sometimes coupled with
physical penetration tests and social engineering. In phys-
ical penetration tests where social engineering is allowed,
the penetration tester directly interacts with the employ-
ees. These interactions are usually based on deception and
if not done properly can upset the employees, violate their
privacy or damage their trust toward the organization and
might lead to law suits and loss of productivity. We propose
two methodologies for performing a physical penetration test
where the goal is to gain an asset using social engineering.
These methodologies aim to reduce the impact of the pene-
tration test on the employees. The methodologies have been
validated by a set of penetration tests performed over a pe-
riod of two years.

INTRODUCTION
A penetration test can assess both the IT security and the
security of the facility where the IT systems are located. If
the penetration tester assesses the IT security, the goal is to
obtain or modify marked data located deep in the organiza-
tions network. Similarly, in testing the physical security of
the location where the IT system is located, the goal of the
penetration test is to obtain a speciﬁc asset, such as a laptop
or a document. Physical and digital penetration tests can
be complemented with social engineering techniques, where
the tester is allowed to use knowledge and help from the
employees to mount the attack.
In digital penetration tests the resilience of an employee
is measured indirectly, by making phone queries or sending
fake mail that lure the employee to disclose secret informa-
tion. These tests can be designed in an ethical manner [1]

and within the legal boundaries [2]. However, measuring
the resilience of an employee against social engineering in a
physical penetration test is direct and personal. When the
tester enters the facility of the organization and directly in-
teracts with the employees, she either deceives the employee,
trying to obtain more information about the goal, or urges
the employee to help her, by letting the tester inside a secure
area or giving the tester a credential. The absence of any
digital medium in the communication with the employees
makes the interaction between the penetration tester and
the employee intense, especially if the employee is asked to
break company policies.
There are three main consequences from personal inter-
action between the tester and the employee. First, the em-
ployee might be stressed by having to choose between help-
ing a colleague and breaking the company policies. Second,
the tester might not treat the employee respectfully. Fi-
nally, when helping the penetration tester to enter a secure
location, the employee loses the trust from the people who
reside in the secure location. For example, employees might
stop trusting the secretary when they ﬁnd out she let an
intruder into their oﬃce. To avoid ethical and legal implica-
tions, organizations may avoid physical penetration testing
with social engineering, leaving themselves unaware of at-
tacks where the attacker uses non-digital means to attack
the system.
This paper tackles the problem how to perform a physical
penetration test using social engineering in the most respect-
ful manner, while still getting results that lead to improving
the security of the organization. The contribution of this
paper is two methodologies for physical penetration tests
using social engineering where the goal is to gain possession
of a physical asset from the premises of the organization.
Both methodologies are designed to reduce the impact of
the test on the employees. The methodologies have been
validated by performing 14 live penetration tests over the
last two years, where students tried to gain possession of
marked laptops placed in buildings of two universities in
The Netherlands.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section
2 we present related work and in section 3 we set the re-
quirements for the methodologies. Sections 4 and 5 outline
the methodologies, section 6 provides an evaluation of the
structure of the methodologies and section 7 concludes the
paper.
2. RELATED WORK
In the computer science literature, there are isolated re-
ports of physical penetration tests using social engineering
[3, 4]. However, these approaches focus completely on the
actions of the penetration tester and do not consider the
impact of the test on the employees.
There are a few methodologies for penetration testing.
The Open-Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OS-
STMM) [5] provides an extensive list of what needs to be
checked during a physical penetration test. However, the
methodology does not state how the testing should be car-
ried out. OSSTMM also does not consider direct interaction
between the penetration tester and the employees. Barret [6]
provides an audit-based methodology for social engineering
using direct interaction between the penetration tester and
an employee. Since this is an audit-based methodology, the
goal is to test all employees. Our methodologies are goal-
based and focus on the security of a speciﬁc physical as-
set. Employees are considered as an additional mechanism
which can be circumvented to achieve the goal, instead of
being the goal. T¨urpe and Eichler [7] focus on safety pre-
cautions while testing production systems. Since a test can
harm the production system, it can cause unforseeable dam-
ages to the organization. In our work the penetration test
of the premises of an organization can be seen as a test of a
production system.
In the crime science community, Cornish [8] provides mech-
anisms how to structure the prosecution of a crime into uni-
versal crime scripts and reasons about mechanisms how to
prevent the crime. We adopt a similar reporting format to
present the results from a penetration test. However, in-
stead of using the crime script to structure multiple attacks,
we use the script to identify security mechanisms that con-
tinuously fail or succeed in stopping an attack.
In social science research, the Bellman report [9] deﬁnes
the ethical guidelines for the protection of humans in testing.
The ﬁrst guideline in the report states that all participants
should be treated with respect during the test. Finn [10]
provides four justiﬁcations that need to be satisﬁed to use
deception in research. We use the same justiﬁcations to show
that our methodology is ethically sound.
3. REQUIREMENTS
A penetration test should satisfy ﬁve requirements to be
useful for the organization. First, the penetration test needs
to be realistic, since it simulates an attack performed by a
real adversary. Second, during the test all employees need
to be treated with respect [9]. The employees should not be
stressed, feel uncomfortable nor be at risk during the pene-
tration test, because they might get disappointed with the
organization, become disgruntled or even start legal action.
Finally, the penetration test should be repeatable, reliable
and reportable [6]. We call these the R* requirements:
Realistic - employees should act normally, as they would
in everyday life.
Respectful - the test is done ethically, by respecting the
employees and the mutual trust between employees.
Reliable - the penetration test does not cause productivity
loss of employees.
Repeatable - the same test can be performed several times
and if the environment does not change, the results should
be the same.
Reportable - all actions during the test should be logged
and the outcome of the test should be in a form that permits
a meaningful and actionable documentation of ﬁndings and
recommendations.
These are conﬂicting requirements. For example:
1. In a realistic penetration test, it might be necessary to
deceive an employee, which is not respectful.
2. In a realistic test, arbitrary employees might be social
engineered to achieve the goal, which is unreliable.
3. In a reportable test, all actions of the penetration tester
need to be logged, which is unrealistic.
Orchestrating a penetration test is striking the best bal-
ance between the conﬂicting requirements.
If the balance
is not achieved, the test might either not fully assess the
security of the organization or might harm the employees.
We propose two methodologies for conducting a penetra-
tion test using social engineering. Both methodologies strike
a diﬀerent balance between the R* requirements, and their
usage is for diﬀerent scenarios. Both methodologies assess
the security of an organization by testing how diﬃcult it is
to gain possession of a pre-deﬁned asset.
The methodologies can be used to assess the security of
the organization, by revealing two types of security weak-
nesses: errors in implementation of procedural and physical
policies by employees and lack of deﬁned security policies
from the management.
In the ﬁrst case, the tests should
focus on how well the employees follow the security policies
of the organization and how eﬀective the existing physical
security controls are. In the second case, the primary goal of
the tests is to ﬁnd and exploit gaps in the existing policies
rather than in their implementation. For example, a test
can focus on how well the credential sharing policy is en-
forced by employees or can focus on exploiting the absence
of a credential sharing policy to obtain the target asset.
In this paper we present the two methodologies which re-
duce the impact of these tests. The environment-focused
(EF) methodology, measures the security of the environment
where the asset is located. The methodology is suitable for
tests where the custodian (person who controls the asset)
is not subject of social engineering and is aware of the ex-
ecution of the test. One example of such test is evaluating
the security of the assets residing in the oﬃce of the CEO,
but not the awareness of the CEO herself. The custodian-
focused (CF) methodology is more general, and includes the
asset owner in the scope of the test. In this methodology,
the owner is not aware of the test. The CF methodology
is more realistic, but it is less reliable and respectful to the
employees.
4. ENVIRONMENT-FOCUSED METHOD
First, we deﬁne the actors in the environment-focused
methodology. Then, we introduce all events that take place
during the setup, execution and aftermath of the penetra-
tion test. Finally, we validate the methodology by conduct-
ing three penetration tests and present some insights from
the experience.

happens in sequence or parallel with other events. For example, event 3 happens after event 2 and in parallel
with events 1 and 4.
ees should behave normally (1 in Figure 2).
As in other penetration testing methodologies, before the
start of the test, the security oﬃcer sets the scope, the rules
of engagement and the goal (2 in Figure 2). The goal is
gaining physical possession of a marked asset. The scope of
the testing provides the penetration tester with a set of lo-
cations she is allowed to enter, as well as business processes
in the organization she can abuse, such as processes for is-
suing a new password, or processes for adding/removing an
employee. The rules of engagement restrict the penetration
tester to the tools and means she is allowed to use to reach
the target. These rules, for example, deﬁne if the tester is
allowed to force doors, to break windows or to use social
engineering.
The custodian ﬁrst signs an informed consent form and
then sets up the environment, by marking an asset in her
possession and installing monitoring equipment.
The asset should not be critical for the daily tasks of the
custodian or anyone else, including the organization. Thus,
when the penetration tester gains possession of the asset,
the productivity of the custodian using the asset and the
process ﬂow of the company will not be aﬀected. The custo-
dian leaves the asset in her oﬃce or an area without people
(storage area, closet). If the custodian shares an oﬃce with
other employees, the monitoring equipment should be po-
sitioned in such a way that it records only the asset and
not the nearby employees. The custodian knows when the
test takes place, and has suﬃcient time to remove/obscure
all sensitive and private assets in her room and around the
marked asset (3 in Figure 2).
Meanwhile, the penetration tester needs to sign the rules
of engagement (4 in Figure 2). The OSSTMM methodol-
ogy [5] provides a comprehensive list of rules of engagement.
4.3 Execution
Figure 1: Actors in the EF methodology
4.1 Actors
The penetration test involves four diﬀerent actors.
Security oﬃcer - an employee responsible for the security
of the organization. The security oﬃcer orchestrates the
penetration test.
Custodian - an employee in possession of the assets, sets
up and monitors the penetration test.
Penetration tester - an employee or a contractor trying to
gain possession of the asset without being caught.
Employee - person in the organization who has none of
the roles above.
The actors and the relations between them are shown in
Figure 1. The majority of actors treat each other with re-
spect. No respect relation between two actors means either
the actors do not interact during the penetration test (for
example between the tester and the custodian) or do not
have a working relationship (between the penetration tester
and the employee). In this methodology, the tester deceives
the employee during the penetration test, presented in the
ﬁgure with a dashed line.
