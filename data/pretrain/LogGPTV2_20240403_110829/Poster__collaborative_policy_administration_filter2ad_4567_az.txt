research and sketch large-scale proposals for public 
spaces working within the context of three different 
site possibilities where the Teen Art Park could be 
situated within the city of Pasadena (see figures 1-3).  
In the second studio, students iterated on the key 
concepts that emerged in the first studio from close 
collaboration with a group of twenty teenagers who 
engaged in workshops and critique sessions with the 
designers.  The teens were recruited from local after-
school programs offered by three of the main partners 
of the project: La Pintoresca Teen Education Center, 
Muir High School and the Armory Center for the Arts.  
In this second phase, the design teams transitioned 
into creating full-scale prototypes of modular 
structures that could animate various different 
configurations of the Teen Art Park independent of 
specific site constraints, (see figures 4 -6) in order to 
explore a broad scope of actionable options with the 
stakeholders of the project.

1.3 Context: Innovative Design for Social Sustainability
The youth that were identified for the Teen Art Park 
project are residents from Northwest Pasadena and 
West Altadena, neighboring cities in Los Angeles 
County that have struggled with lack of economic 
opportunity, declining public education and youth-led 
gang violence since the 1970s. The region is prone to 
high rates of youth unemployment as well as a high 
percentage of public high school dropouts.  In addition, 
both cities include a dichotomy of contrasts with 
areas of great affluence in close proximity to areas of 
income levels that are below the US National “poverty 
threshold.”4

 The poverty thresholds are the original measure of the federal poverty measure.  
The US Government poverty threshold is adjusted for inflation and the consumer 
price index.  For 2012, the poverty level was set at $23,050 (total year income) for 
a family of four. 2012 HHS Poverty Guidelines.  Accessed February 2013: http://

In a recent study about Design for Social Sustainability 
(2011), the Young Foundation defines social 
sustainability as: 
“A process for creating sustainable, 
successful places that promote wellbeing, 
by understanding what people need from 
the places they live and work.   Social 
Sustainability combines design of the physical 
realm with design of the social world— 
infrastructure to support social and cultural 
life, social amenities, systems for citizen 
engagement and space for people and places 
to evolve.”5 
The participation of the teenagers and a wide array 
of staff and educators from the community-based 
organizations in the Teen Art Park consortium afforded 
the design teams at Art Center the opportunity to think 
about the long-term success and sustainability of the

social life that would animate the design schemes 
proposed for the Teen Art Park, infusing the physical 
designs with the user-centered aspirations uncovered 
in the collaborative framework of the project.
2. RESEARCH PROCESS AND DESIGN
2.1 Methods
Participatory design research methods defined the 
investigation of the Teen Art Park initiative: the design 
learning in the studios relied on a fertile ground of 
co-design where students were encouraged to access 
an immersive context enriched by the multiplicity 
of perspectives and life experiences that the 
participating teens in the studios imparted.  
Envisioned as a safe environment for creative 
expression and human development for underserved 
teens, some of the underlying concepts that emerged 
from the research of the Teen Art Park included

The teen art park we envisioned is one that would 
be a place for transformation, where you could 
become the best version of who you can possibly 
be.
I want to build on my 
skills so one day I can go 
to art school and have a 
successful career.
We want a place of our 
own, just for teens, but 
also a safe environment. 
So many of the kids we met feel as though society 
is just pushing them into a corner and leaving them 
to fend for themselves.  All these teens have a deep 
desire to be heard.   Together, we can give them a 
voice. 
I feel connected with art.  
These pieces make me feel 
like drawing.
I wouldn’t change 
anything about the space. 
I like the uniqueness, the 
colors,  the textures.
The number one thing in this project is that it’s 
about the teens.   Everything about the space has to 
be about them. And it has to be genuine.

my own style and develop 
my graphic skills.

the idea of designing spaces that would promote 
opportunities for dialogue, collective activities, 
and mentorship with peers. In this sense, the park 
would therefore be not just a destination, but also a 
starting point for the journey toward visualizing and 
reaching one’s creative potential.  The table above 
captures a few statements from the design teams and 
participating teens and summarizes the design criteria 
underlying the design development of each projects.

important features that the environments would need

to creativity and skill development and 3/ positive and 
safe environment. 
2.2 From Concept to Implementation: Final Modular Designs
Following the conclusion of the second studio, 
semi-permanent homes within the context of the 
project partners’ facilities (such as indoor lounge and 
exterior courtyard areas) were found for the various 
structural components of the design prototypes 
and deployed across various locations in the city 
of Pasadena.   After a period of approximately six 
months of testing of the modular structures by teens 
and partners, in fall 2012, Designmatters convened 
an independent study seminar directed by Professor 
James Meraz, the principal investigator of the project, 
with a sub-set of students who were committed to 
seeing their proposals go forward to a manufacturing 
and implementation-ready stage. This final design 
process included a rigorous phase of iteration based 
on new feedback and insights collected from users and 
partners that addressed considerations of durability,

mobility of the structures, and cost.  At the time of 
this writing (spring 2013), the following designs are 
included in an executive report developed by the 
Designmatters Department that lays out a set of 
recommendations for the project partners to take 
forward the proposed designs as the continuing policy 
work to designate a possible site for the Teen Art Park 
unfolds in the City of Pasadena.6   The three projects 
that fully developed in this final phase are:

transformative structure for creative self-expression 
that includes a lounge area, a performing stage and 
detachable painting boards for graffiti and art making 
(figure 7).
Chair Mock, lead designer Adam Patrick Easter 
Cottingham:  the over-size chair concept is a sturdier 
and more flexible iteration of the original piece that 
resulted from the second phase studio. The chair 
structure is now made of steel; it includes a light-
weight customizable mesh material for the seating

area and wheels for ease of mobility and flexibility in 
seating configurations (figure 8). 
Hub, lead designer Seth Baker: this is a system of 
components that can be layered onto a wide array of 
landscapes and public spaces ranging from parks to 
courtyards and commercial malls.  The system includes 
“boom tubes” an umbrella-like seating area that is 
designed to amplify sound and encourage music 
listening, as well as “parked-stools” and “roller-stools,” 
seating areas that can take on moving and permanent 
configurations depending on the setting (figure 9).
3. DISCUSSION
3.1 Collaboration, Alignment and Divergence 
The Teen Art Park concepts that underwent final 
development are intended to be not just an end unto 
themselves, but a departure point for the teens that 
will animate and use these structures.   A common 
denominator of all of the design schemes proposed 
is that users had a say in shaping the structures 
functionalities and as much as the designers did 
in conceiving them.   As one of the instructors of 
122
the studio, Chris Adamick remarked, the necessary 
interactions and collaboration that characterized 
the process throughout involved a multiplicity 
of stakeholders who had diverse and sometimes 
conflicting interests.  The inherent challenges that 
surfaced were “solved through collaboration— an 
extremely valuable aspect of this experience from a 
design educational standpoint.”  The faculty saw this 
collaborative dimension for the design teams and the 
teens as somewhat of an uncharted territory and a 
transformative proposition. 7
The value of collaboration in this initiative – 
which specifically entailed getting to a common 
understanding of the capacity of art to improve 
people’s lives in their neighborhoods—defined all 
of the project interactions Designmatters facilitated 
with the main partner organizations that make up 
the Teen Art Park consortium.  As the Executive 
Director, Scott Ward of the Armory for the Arts cites: 
“We believe that art is an essential component of the 
human experience: a highly effective tool to promote 
creativity, self-confidence, tolerance, individuality and, 
at the same time a sense of community—the Teen Art 
Park project fits right into that sense of mission.”8 
Pretending however that the alignment with partners 
and synergies the Teen Art Park project uncovered 
was free from junctures where the collaboration 
was also characterized by divergence of aims and 
timelines between the educators, community leaders 
and nonprofits engaged in the initiative would not 
be honoring the richness and complexity of the 
undertaking. If anything, the most invaluable and 
intangible lessons from the initiative as far as the 
practice of social impact design education is concerned, 
originated, in this author’s view, from the difficulties at 
times in reconciling academic calendars, educational 
learning outcomes and grant research aims, with the 
day-to-day pressures and obligations of resource 
constrained organizations serving a very vulnerable 
population of teens.  As Dr. Mikala Rahn, the founder 
of Learning Works Charter School explains: “We are 
pioneering a model that does not exist in California—a 
last chance program.   We have 400 students that 
we call ‘youth in crisis,’ because they are way beyond 
at risk…. To work with these students one must be 
inordinately loving and forgiving every single day.”9
For the design educators of Teen Art Park and for the 
partners, perhaps one of the most rewarding aspects of 
“We believe that art is an 
essential part of the human 
experience: a highly effective 
tool to promote creativity, self-
confidence, tolerance, individuality 
and at the same time a sense of 
community—the Teen Art Park 
project fits right into that sense of 
mission.”

the collaboration was to witness the respect and trust 
that emerged between the teens and the design teams.  
The design process in the studios was characterized 
by active listening of the teens’ wants and needs, and 
built on them.  
For designers Breon Waters and Adam Cottingham, 
their Teen Art Park concept was precisely centered on 
the teens’ aspirations they came to internalize.  This 
inspiration drove them to create a miniature urban fun 
zone where the focus was all about “a park design as a 
place to chill, a place to be heard, and a place to grow 
for the teens to become stronger individuals.”10
A final note about the complexity of the Teen 
Art Park project touches upon the fact that the 
initiative suffered somewhat as far as the actual 
implementation planning is concerned, because 
an anticipated commitment by the partners for a 
permanent site for the Teen Art Park project by the 
time the studios started did not materialize.  This 
prompted the design teams’ need to anchor concepts 
around three plausible sites in the first studio, and

in the second studio that could function in a wide 
variety of sites in order to ensure that the city of 
Pasadena and project partners would have a range of 
actionable options to take forward at the completion 
of the design stage of the project.   While this change
