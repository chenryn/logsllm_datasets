In the initial phase, students from the design studios researched and sketched large-scale proposals for public spaces, considering three potential sites within the city of Pasadena (see Figures 1-3). In the second studio, the students refined key concepts that emerged from close collaboration with a group of twenty teenagers who participated in workshops and critique sessions. These teens were recruited from local after-school programs at La Pintoresca Teen Education Center, Muir High School, and the Armory Center for the Arts. During this phase, the design teams developed full-scale prototypes of modular structures that could be configured in various ways, independent of specific site constraints (see Figures 4-6), to explore a broad range of actionable options with project stakeholders.

### 1.3 Context: Innovative Design for Social Sustainability
The Teen Art Park project targets youth from Northwest Pasadena and West Altadena, neighboring cities in Los Angeles County that have faced challenges such as lack of economic opportunity, declining public education, and youth-led gang violence since the 1970s. The region has high rates of youth unemployment and a significant number of public high school dropouts. Additionally, both cities exhibit stark contrasts, with areas of affluence adjacent to areas below the US National "poverty threshold." For 2012, the poverty level was set at $23,050 (total year income) for a family of four, according to the 2012 HHS Poverty Guidelines.

In a 2011 study on Design for Social Sustainability, the Young Foundation defines social sustainability as:
"A process for creating sustainable, successful places that promote well-being by understanding what people need from the places they live and work. Social Sustainability combines the design of the physical realm with the design of the social world—infrastructure to support social and cultural life, social amenities, systems for citizen engagement, and space for people and places to evolve."

The involvement of teenagers and staff from community-based organizations in the Teen Art Park consortium allowed the design teams at Art Center to consider the long-term success and sustainability of the social life that would animate the proposed designs, infusing them with user-centered aspirations uncovered through collaborative efforts.

### 2. RESEARCH PROCESS AND DESIGN
#### 2.1 Methods
Participatory design research methods defined the investigation of the Teen Art Park initiative. The design learning in the studios relied on a co-design approach, where students engaged with the diverse perspectives and life experiences of the participating teens. Envisioned as a safe environment for creative expression and human development for underserved teens, some of the underlying concepts that emerged from the research included:

| **Design Criteria** | **Perspectives** |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Identity and Belonging** | Designers: "The teen art park we envisioned is one that would be a place for transformation, where you could become the best version of who you can possibly be." <br> Teens: "We want a place of our own, just for teens, but also a safe environment." |
| **Access to Creativity & Skill Development** | Teens: "I want to build on my skills so one day I can go to art school and have a successful career." <br> "I am motivated to keep up my own style and develop my graphic skills." |
| **Positive and Safe Environment** | Teens: "I wouldn’t change anything about the space. I like the uniqueness, the colors, the textures." <br> "It makes me feel at peace and connected to the world." |

The idea of designing spaces that would promote opportunities for dialogue, collective activities, and mentorship with peers was a key concept. The table above captures statements from the design teams and participating teens, summarizing the design criteria underlying the development of each project. From the exchange with the teens, the following drivers emerged as important features: 1) identity and belonging, 2) access to creativity and skill development, and 3) a positive and safe environment.

#### 2.2 From Concept to Implementation: Final Modular Designs
Following the second studio, semi-permanent homes were found for the structural components of the design prototypes within the facilities of project partners, such as indoor lounges and exterior courtyards. After six months of testing, Designmatters convened an independent study seminar directed by Professor James Meraz, the principal investigator, with a subset of students committed to advancing their proposals to a manufacturing and implementation-ready stage. This final design process included rigorous iteration based on new feedback and insights, addressing durability, mobility, and cost. As of spring 2013, the following designs are included in an executive report by the Designmatters Department, which provides recommendations for the project partners:

- **Freesol Graffiti Lounge (Lead Designer: Anycia Lee)**: A transformative structure for creative self-expression, including a lounge area, performing stage, and detachable painting boards for graffiti and art making (Figure 7).
- **Chair Mock (Lead Designer: Adam Patrick Easter Cottingham)**: An oversized chair concept made of steel, featuring lightweight customizable mesh seating and wheels for mobility (Figure 8).
- **Hub (Lead Designer: Seth Baker)**: A system of components for various landscapes and public spaces, including "boom tubes" for sound amplification and music listening, and "parked-stools" and "roller-stools" for flexible seating configurations (Figure 9).

### 3. DISCUSSION
#### 3.1 Collaboration, Alignment, and Divergence
The Teen Art Park concepts that underwent final development are intended to be more than just destinations; they are starting points for the teens who will use these structures. A common denominator among all the design schemes is that users had a say in shaping the functionalities, just as designers did in conceiving them. As instructor Chris Adamick noted, the necessary interactions and collaboration involved a multiplicity of stakeholders with diverse and sometimes conflicting interests. These challenges were addressed through collaboration, which was seen as a valuable aspect of the design educational experience.

The value of collaboration in this initiative, particularly in understanding the capacity of art to improve lives in neighborhoods, defined all project interactions facilitated by Designmatters with the main partner organizations. Scott Ward, Executive Director of the Armory for the Arts, stated, "We believe that art is an essential part of the human experience: a highly effective tool to promote creativity, self-confidence, tolerance, individuality, and a sense of community—the Teen Art Park project fits right into that sense of mission."

However, the alignment with partners and the synergies uncovered were not without divergence in aims and timelines between educators, community leaders, and nonprofits. The most invaluable lessons from the initiative, in terms of social impact design education, arose from the difficulties in reconciling academic calendars, educational outcomes, and grant research aims with the day-to-day pressures of resource-constrained organizations serving vulnerable teens. Dr. Mikala Rahn, founder of Learning Works Charter School, explained, "We are pioneering a model that does not exist in California—a last chance program. We have 400 students that we call 'youth in crisis' because they are way beyond at risk…. To work with these students, one must be inordinately loving and forgiving every single day."

For the design educators and partners, one of the most rewarding aspects of the collaboration was witnessing the respect and trust that emerged between the teens and the design teams. The design process in the studios was characterized by active listening to the teens' wants and needs and building on them. For designers Breon Waters and Adam Cottingham, their Teen Art Park concept was centered on the teens' aspirations, driving them to create a miniature urban fun zone focused on "a park design as a place to chill, a place to be heard, and a place to grow for the teens to become stronger individuals."

A final note on the complexity of the Teen Art Park project: the initiative faced challenges in implementation planning due to the lack of a committed permanent site by the time the studios started. This prompted the design teams to anchor concepts around three plausible sites in the first studio and then shift to developing modular components in the second studio that could function in a wide variety of sites. While this change required flexibility, it ensured that the city of Pasadena and project partners would have a range of actionable options to take forward at the completion of the design stage.

"At the core of every Designmatters at Art Center educational project collaboration is the fundamental belief in the power of design to drive positive social change."
