# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
~~Product Launcher should support keyboard layout mapping for all system
keyboard layouts, for example:~~
~~**US Keyboard** ⟶ **Russian Keyboard**~~  
~~**Russian Keyboard** ⟶ **US Keyboard**~~  
EDIT: commenting out the part about the keyboard switching since it nor
relevant, this problem is present even for languages that don't require to
switch keyboard.
Query **"ьшскщыщае еуфьы"** should display the results of **"ьшскщыщае
еуфьы"** and **"microsoft teams"** queries.
Query **"rfkmrekznjh"** should display the results of **"калькулятор"** and
**"rfkmrekznjh"** queries.
## P.S.
Also Product Launcher should search for the localized app names(`ms-
resource:AppName`) like a Windows Search.
