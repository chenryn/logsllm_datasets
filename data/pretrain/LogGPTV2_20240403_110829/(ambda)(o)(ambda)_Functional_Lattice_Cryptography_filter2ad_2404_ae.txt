2.2.4 Canonical Embedding
There are 𝑛 distinct ring embeddings (i.e., injective ring homomorphisms) 𝜎𝑖 : 𝐾 → C,
√−1/𝑚) ∈ C
indexed by 𝑖 ∈ Z*
is the principal 𝑚th complex root of unity. These embeddings come in conjugate pairs
𝑚, which are deﬁned by 𝜎𝑖(𝜁𝑚) = 𝜔𝑖
𝑚 where 𝜔𝑚 = exp(2𝜋
(𝜎𝑖, 𝜎𝑚−𝑖), because 𝜔𝑖
is the concatenation of all the embeddings (under a suitable reindexing of Z*
𝑚 is the complex conjugate of 𝜔𝑚−𝑖
𝑚 . The canonical embedding

𝜎 : 𝐾 → 𝐻
𝜎(𝑎) = (𝜎𝑖(𝑎))𝑖∈Z*
𝑚
where 𝐻 ⊂ C𝑛 is the subspace deﬁned above in subsection 2.1.2.
We endow 𝐾 and 𝑅 with a geometry using the canonical embedding 𝜎, i.e., all geometric
quantities on 𝐾 and 𝑅 are deﬁned in terms of the canonical embedding. For example, we
deﬁne the ℓ2 norm on 𝐾 as ‖𝑥‖2 = ‖𝜎(𝑥)‖2 =√︀⟨𝜎(𝑥), 𝜎(𝑥)⟩, and use this to deﬁne the
continuous Gaussian distribution 𝐷𝑟 over 𝐾.2 A key property is that both addition and
multiplication in the ring are coordinate-wise in the canonical embedding:
𝜎(𝑎 + 𝑏) = 𝜎(𝑎) + 𝜎(𝑏)
𝜎(𝑎 · 𝑏) = 𝜎(𝑎) ⊙ 𝜎(𝑏).
This property aids analysis and allows for sharp bounds on the growth of errors in crypto-
graphic applications.
For two-power cyclotomics, this geometry is particulary simple: 𝜎 is just a scaling
√
by a
𝑛 factor, followed by a rigid rotation (an isometry). Therefore, a sample from
the Gaussian distribution 𝐷𝑟 over 𝐻 (and over 𝐾, via 𝜎−1) has independent power-basis

coefﬁcients, drawn from 𝐷𝑟/
𝑛.

(Tweaked) Decoding Basis
Ideal lattices. Recall that an ideal ℐ ⊆ 𝑅 is a nontrivial additive subgroup that is also
closed under multiplication by 𝑅. The norm is deﬁned as N(ℐ) := |𝑅/ℐ|, the index
2To be formal, the continuous Gaussian is deﬁned over 𝐾R := 𝐾 ⊗Q R, which is analogous to 𝐾 as the
reals R are to the rationals Q, and which is in bijective correspondence with 𝐻 via the natural extension of 𝜎.
Because precision is always ﬁnite in any computational context, in this work we ignore the formal distinction
between 𝐾 and 𝐾R.

of ℐ in 𝑅. A fractional ideal 𝒥 ⊂ 𝐾 is a set that can be expressed as 𝒥 = 𝑑−1 · ℐ for
some ideal ℐ ⊆ 𝑅 and 𝑑 ∈ 𝑅. (We sometimes omit the word “fractional” when it is
clear from context.) Its norm is deﬁned as N(𝒥 ) := N(ℐ)/ N(𝑑). The fractional ideals
form a group under multiplication (with 𝑅 as the identity), where ideal multiplication is
𝑖 𝑥𝑖𝑦𝑖 : 𝑥𝑖 ∈ ℐ, 𝑦𝑖 ∈ 𝒥 }. The norm map is then multiplicative:
deﬁned by ℐ𝒥 = {∑︀
N(ℐ𝒥 ) = N(ℐ) N(𝒥 ).
Any (fractional) ideal ℐ yields a lattice 𝜎(ℐ) ⊂ 𝐻 under the canonical embedding.
As usual, we often leave 𝜎 implicit and refer to ℐ itself as a lattice. The following lower
bound on the minimum distance of an ideal lattice is an immediate consequence of the
arithmetic-mean/geometric-mean inequality.
Lemma 2.2.1. For any fractional ideal ℐ ⊂ 𝐾, we have 𝜆1(ℐ) ≥ √
𝑛 · N(ℐ)1/𝑛.
The dual ideal, and a “tweak.” Any fractional ideal ℐ ⊂ 𝐾 has a dual (fractional)
ideal ℐ∨, which under the canonical embedding corresponds to (the complex conjugate of)
the dual lattice of ℐ, i.e., 𝜎(ℐ) and 𝜎(ℐ∨) are duals. In particular, the dual ideal 𝑅∨ of 𝑅,
also called the codifferent ideal, is deﬁned as the dual of 𝑅 under the trace, i.e.,
𝑅∨ := {fractional 𝑎 : Tr𝑅/Z(𝑎 · 𝑅) ⊆ Z}.
The dual ideal 𝐼∨ is related to the inverse ideal via the codifferent: ℐ∨ = ℐ−1𝑅∨. (See,
e.g., [Con09] for further details and proofs.) By the composition property of the trace,
(𝑅′)∨ is the set of all fractional 𝑎 such that Tr𝑅′/𝑅(𝑎 · 𝑅′) ⊆ 𝑅∨. In particular, we have
Tr𝑅′/𝑅((𝑅′)∨) = 𝑅∨.
Concretely, the dual ideal is the principal fractional ideal 𝑅∨ = (𝑔𝑚/ ˆ𝑚)𝑅, where
ˆ𝑚 = 𝑚/2 if 𝑚 is even and ˆ𝑚 = 𝑚 otherwise, and the special element 𝑔𝑚 ∈ 𝑅 is as follows:
• for 𝑚 = 𝑝𝑒 for prime 𝑝 and 𝑒 ≥ 1, we have 𝑔𝑚 = 𝑔𝑝 := 1 − 𝜁𝑝 if 𝑝 is odd, and
𝑔𝑚 = 𝑔𝑝 := 1 if 𝑝 = 2;
22
• for 𝑚 =∏︀
ℓ 𝑚ℓ where the 𝑚ℓ are powers of distinct primes, we have 𝑔𝑚 =∏︀
ℓ 𝑔𝑚ℓ.
The dual ideal 𝑅∨ plays a very important role in the deﬁnition, hardness proofs, and
cryptographic applications of Ring-LWE (see [LPR13b; LPR13a] for details). However,
for implementations it seems preferable to work entirely in 𝑅, so that we do not to have to
contend with fractional values or the dual ideal explicitly. Following [AP13], we achieve
this by multiplying all values related to 𝑅∨ by the “tweak” factor 𝑡𝑚 = ˆ𝑚/𝑔𝑚 ∈ 𝑅; recall
that 𝑡𝑚𝑅∨ = 𝑅. To compensate for this implicit tweak factor, we replace the trace by what
we call the twace (for “tweaked trace”) function Tw𝑚′,𝑚 = Tw𝑅′/𝑅 : 𝑅′ → 𝑅, deﬁned as
Tw𝑅′/𝑅(𝑥) := 𝑡𝑚 · Tr𝑅′/𝑅(𝑥/𝑡𝑚′) = ( ˆ𝑚/ ˆ𝑚′) · Tr𝑅′/𝑅(𝑥 · 𝑔𝑚′/𝑔𝑚).
(2.2.4)
A nice feature of the twace is that it ﬁxes the base ring pointwise, i.e., Tw𝑅′/𝑅(𝑥) = 𝑥 for
every 𝑥 ∈ 𝑅. It is also easy to verify that it satisﬁes the same composition property that the
trace does.
We stress that this “tweaked” perspective is mathematically and computationally equiva-
lent to using 𝑅∨, and all the results from [LPR13b; LPR13a] can translate to this setting
without any loss.
Decoding Basis. The work of [LPR13a] deﬁnes a certain Z-basis ⃗𝑏𝑚 = (𝑏𝑗) of 𝑅∨, called
the decoding basis. It is deﬁned as the dual of the conjugated powerful basis ⃗𝑝𝑚 = (𝑝𝑗)
under the trace:
Tr𝑅/Z(𝑏𝑗 · 𝑝−1
𝑗′ ) = 𝛿𝑗,𝑗′
for all 𝑗, 𝑗′. The key geometric property of the decoding basis is, informally, that the Z-
coefﬁcients of any 𝑒 ∈ 𝑅∨ with respect to ⃗𝑏𝑚 are optimally small in relation to 𝜎(𝑥), the
canonical embedding of 𝑒. In other words, short elements like Gaussian errors have small
decoding-basis coefﬁcients.
23
With the above-described “tweak” that replaces 𝑅∨ by 𝑅, we get the Z-basis
⃗𝑑𝑚 = (𝑑𝑗) := 𝑡𝑚 · ⃗𝑏𝑚 ,
which we call the (tweaked) decoding basis of 𝑅. By deﬁnition, this basis is dual to the
conjugated powerful basis ⃗𝑝𝑚 under the twace:
Tw𝑅/Z(𝑑𝑗 · 𝑝−1
𝑗′ ) = 𝛿𝑗,𝑗′.
Because 𝑔𝑚 · 𝑡𝑚 = ˆ𝑚, it follows that the coefﬁcients of any 𝑒 ∈ 𝑅 with respect to ⃗𝑑𝑚 are
identical to those of 𝑔𝑚 · 𝑒 ∈ 𝑔𝑚𝑅 = ˆ𝑚𝑅∨ with respect to the Z-basis 𝑔𝑚 · ⃗𝑑𝑚 = ˆ𝑚 · ⃗𝑏𝑚 of
𝑔𝑚𝑅. Hence, they are optimally small in relation to 𝜎(𝑔𝑚 · 𝑒).3
Relative decoding basis. Generalizing the above, the relative decoding basis ⃗𝑑𝑚′,𝑚 of
𝑅′/𝑅 is dual to the (conjugated) relative powerful basis ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 under Tw𝑅′/𝑅. As such, ⃗𝑑𝑚′,𝑚
(and in particular, ⃗𝑑𝑚′ itself) has a Kronecker-product structure mirroring that of ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 from
Equations (2.2.1) and (2.2.3). Furthermore, by the results of [LPR13a, Section 6], for a
positive power 𝑚 of a prime 𝑝 we have
⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩⃗𝑝𝑡
⃗𝑑𝑡

otherwise,
(2.2.5)
where 𝐿𝑝 is the lower-triangular matrix with 1s throughout its lower triangle.
3This is why Invariant 4.2.2 of our somewhat-homomorphic encryption scheme (section 4.3) requires
𝜎(𝑒 · 𝑔𝑚) to be short, where 𝑒 is the error in the ciphertext.

2.2.6 Chinese Remainder Bases
This section contains a relatively brief summary of the Chinese Remainder sets and bases
used throughout this thesis; see [LPR13b; LPR13a] for many more mathematical and
computational details.
Prime splitting. As usual, let 𝑅 denote the 𝑚th cyclotomic ring and 𝑛 = 𝜙(𝑚). Let 𝑝 ∈ Z
be a prime integer, which for simplicity we assume does not divide 𝑚. The factorization
of the ideal 𝑝𝑅 into prime ideals is as follows. Let 𝑑 be the order of 𝑝 modulo 𝑚, i.e.,
the smallest positive integer such that 𝑝𝑑 = 1 (mod 𝑚), and note that 𝑑 | 𝑛. Let ⟨𝑝⟩ =
{1, 𝑝, 𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝑑−1} ⊆ Z*
𝑚 denote the multiplicative subgroup generated by 𝑝. Then 𝑝𝑅
factors as
∏︁
𝑝𝑅 =
p𝑖 ,
𝑖
where the p𝑖 are indexed by the quotient group 𝐺 = Z*
of cosets 𝑖⟨𝑝⟩ of the subgroup ⟨𝑝⟩ of Z*
𝑅, and their number 𝑛/𝑑 is called the splitting number of 𝑝 in 𝑅.
𝑚/⟨𝑝⟩, i.e., the multiplicative group
𝑚. These are called the prime ideals lying over 𝑝 in
Concretely, the ideals lying over 𝑝 are as follows: let 𝜔𝑚 be some arbitrary element of
order 𝑚 in the ﬁnite ﬁeld F𝑝𝑑. (Such an element exists because the multiplicative group F*
𝑝𝑑
is cyclic and has order 𝑝𝑑−1 = 0 (mod 𝑚).) For each 𝑖 ∈ Z*
𝑚, deﬁne a ring homomorphism
ℎ𝑖 : 𝑅 → F𝑝𝑑 by ℎ𝑖(𝜁𝑚) = 𝜔𝑖
𝑚. Then the prime ideal p𝐼 corresponding to the coset 𝐼 of ⟨𝑝⟩
is the kernel of the homomorphism ℎ𝑖, where 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 denotes some arbitrary element of the
coset. It is easy to verify that this is an ideal, and that it is invariant under the choice of
representative, because ℎ𝑖·𝑝(𝑟) = ℎ𝑖(𝑟)𝑝 for any 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅 since F𝑝𝑑 has characteristic 𝑝 and
therefore (𝑎 + 𝑏)𝑝 = 𝑎𝑝 + 𝑏𝑝 for any 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ F𝑝𝑑. Because p𝐼 is the kernel of ℎ𝑖, the induced
ring homomorphisms ℎ𝑖 : 𝑅/p𝐼 → F𝑝𝑑 for all 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 are in fact isomorphisms.
phism from 𝑅𝑝 := 𝑅/𝑝𝑅 to the product ring ∏︀
The Chinese Remainder Theorem states (in particular) that the natural ring homomor-
𝐼(𝑅/p𝐼) ∼= (F𝑝𝑑)𝑛/𝑑, where 𝐼 ranges
25
over all cosets of ⟨𝑝⟩ ⊆ Z*
𝑚, is a ring isomorphism.
In particular, the concatenation
𝑚 : 𝑅𝑝 → F𝑛
2𝑑 is a ring embedding (an injective ring homomorphism). We refer
ℎ = (ℎ𝑖)𝑖∈Z*
to the set ⃗𝑐 = {𝑐𝐼} ⊂ 𝑅𝑝, where 𝑐𝐼 = 1 (mod p𝐼) and 𝑐𝐼 = 0 (mod p𝐽 ) for all cosets 𝐼 ̸= 𝐽
of ⟨𝑝⟩, as the mod-𝑝 CRT set of 𝑅. In particular, for the CRT set ⃗𝑐 of 𝑅𝑝, for any 𝑧 ∈ 𝑅𝑝 we
have
Similarly, for a prime power 𝑝ℓ the natural ring homomorphism from 𝑅𝑝ℓ to∏︀
𝑝𝑑 /F𝑝(ℎ(𝑧)).
Tr𝑅𝑝/Z𝑝(𝑧 · ⃗𝑐) = TrF
(2.2.6)
𝐼(𝑅/pℓ
𝐼) is a
ring isomorphism, and the mod-𝑝ℓ CRT set is deﬁned analogously.
¯𝑅 = 𝒪 ¯𝑚 and 𝑝 ¯𝑅 =∏︀
Finally, consider the general case where 𝑝 may divide 𝑚. It turns out that this case easily
reduces to the one where 𝑝 does not divide 𝑚, as follows. Let 𝑚 = 𝑝𝑘 · ¯𝑚 for 𝑝 (cid:45) ¯𝑚, and let
𝑖 ¯p𝑖 be the prime-ideal factorization of 𝑝 ¯𝑅 as described above. Then
the ideals ¯p𝑖 ⊂ ¯𝑅 are totally ramiﬁed in 𝑅, i.e., we have ¯p𝑖𝑅 = p𝜙(𝑚)/𝜙( ¯𝑚)
for some distinct
prime ideals p𝑖 ⊂ 𝑅. This implies that the CRT set for 𝑅𝑝 is exactly the CRT set for ¯𝑅𝑝,
embedded into 𝑅𝑝. Therefore, in what follows we restrict our attention to the case where 𝑝
𝑖
does not divide 𝑚.
CRT Set Extensions. As above, let 𝑝 be a prime integer not dividing 𝑚, let 𝑝 have order
𝑚′, and let p𝐼′ ⊂ 𝑅′ be the prime ideals lying over 𝑝 in 𝑅′, where 𝐼′ ranges over
𝑑′|𝑛′ in Z*
the cosets of ⟨𝑝⟩ ⊆ Z*
𝑚′. Then each p𝐼 lies over exactly one p𝐼′, i.e., it is a divisor of exactly
one ideal p𝐼′𝑅, namely, the one for which 𝐼′ = 𝐼 mod 𝑚′. Therefore, there are exactly
(𝑛/𝑑)/(𝑛′/𝑑′) prime ideals lying over each p𝐼′; this number is called the relative splitting
number of 𝑝 in the extension 𝑅/𝑅′.
CRT Basis When the order of 𝑝 modulo 𝑚 is 1, 𝑝𝑅 factors into 𝑛 distinct prime ideals,
and the mod-𝑝 CRT set becomes a Chinese remainder (or CRT) Z𝑝-basis ⃗𝑐 = ⃗𝑐𝑚 ∈ 𝑅𝜙(𝑚)
whose entries are indexed by Z*
𝑚. This happens precisely when 𝑝 is a prime congruent to
,
𝑝

1 (mod 𝑚). The key property satisﬁed by this basis is
𝑐𝑖 · 𝑐𝑖′ = 𝛿𝑖,𝑖′ · 𝑐𝑖
(2.2.7)
for all 𝑖, 𝑖′ ∈ Z*
coefﬁcient-wise (and hence linear time): for any coefﬁcient vectors a, b ∈ Z𝜙(𝑚)
𝑚. Therefore, multiplication of ring elements represented in the CRT basis is
, we have
𝑝
(⃗𝑐𝑡 · a) · (⃗𝑐𝑡 · b) = ⃗𝑐𝑡 · (a ⊙ b).
Also by Equation (2.2.7), the matrix corresponding to multiplication by 𝑐𝑖 (with respect to
the CRT basis) has one in the 𝑖th diagonal entry and zeros everywhere else, so the trace
of every CRT basis element is unity: Tr𝑅/Z(⃗𝑐) = 1 (mod 𝑝). For completeness, in what
follows we describe the explicit construction of the CRT basis.
