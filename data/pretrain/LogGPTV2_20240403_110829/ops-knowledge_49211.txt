User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题MySQL replication & logrotate I'm using MySQL Master-Slave replication for backup purposes (for a few days).

Today after changing to expire_logs_days = 3 on master and slave I got this message (from slave):  

/etc/cron.daily/logrotate: 
/usr/bin/mysqladmin: refresh failed; error: 'Can't generate a unique log-filename mysqld-relay-bin.(1-999)'
error: error running shared postrotate script for '/var/log/mysql.log /var/log/mysql/mysql.log /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log '
run-parts: /etc/cron.daily/logrotate exited with return code 1


I tried to google what that message mean ("Can't generate...") but only error message definitions found instead of explanation.  

Currently I've about 50 bin-log files on slave (mysqld-relay-bin.000003 to mysqld-relay.bin.000052).

Assistant: Make sure the password set in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf for the debian-sys-maint user is the same for both the Master and the Slave, since the slave is an exact copy of the master, they have the same users table.
