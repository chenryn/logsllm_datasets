User:  How to implement batch management and deployment of multiple servers through Ansible?
Assistant: Ansible can be used to implement batch management and deployment of multiple servers through the following steps: 1. Install Ansible: Install Ansible on a host and ensure that all servers to be managed can access the host. 2. Configure SSH key authentication: use the ssh-keygen command to generate a key pair, and add the public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of all servers to be managed, so as not to frequently enter passwords. 3. Write Ansible Playbook: Create an Ansible Playbook file that contains the tasks and host inventory to execute. You can use Ansible's modules and plugins to perform various tasks such as software installation, configuration file updates, service startup or restart, and more. 4. Execute Ansible Playbook: Run the ansible-playbook command and specify the Playbook file to use, host inventory file, and optional other parameters such as username, password, etc. 5. Check the execution result: According to the task content in the Playbook, you can check the execution result of each task to ensure that all servers have been successfully configured. Precautions: - Before executing Ansible Playbook, you must ensure that all servers to be managed can be accessed and connected normally. - Before writing Ansible Playbook, it is necessary to understand the configuration and system environment of each target server to ensure that all tasks can be executed correctly. - When executing Ansible Playbooks, care must be taken not to accidentally overwrite or delete critical files or configurations. Backup and recovery measures can be done before execution.
