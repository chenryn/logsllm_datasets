User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can I trust DNS servers? If I use my own VPN and use third party DNS - can I trust it?

For example, is there any possibilities that an attacker can track the requests by contacting the DNS-hosting (assume that attacker have order and DNS-hosting have logs), and find out what sites I have visited? Because DNS requests are bypassing the VPN?

And if there is such a risk, how to solve this problem? 
Should I use my own DNS server instead of third party for added security?

Assistant: No, you can't. 

It's as easy as you search information about "DNS leak" topic. When you use a VPN, you have the risk of a DNS leak. In other words, your DNS resolution will be made outside your VPN. 

Second, VPN server knows (in some way) who you are, where are you from and where you want to go. It's the same risk that exit nodes of Tor Network pose. 

Anyway, it depends of how paranoid you woke up today.
