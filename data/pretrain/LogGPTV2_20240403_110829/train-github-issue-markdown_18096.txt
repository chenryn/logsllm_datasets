I am trying to create a group that consists of THREE.Line and THREE.Mesh:
    var line = new THREE.Line(text3d, lineMaterial);
    var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(text3d, faceMaterial);
    var group = new THREE.Object3D();
    group.add(line);
    group.add(mesh);
Unfortunately, only the "line" is rendered to the scene. If I change the order
of adding to the group, that is that if I add "mesh" to the group before
"line", then only "mesh" is rendered.
Of course, I want both elements to be rendered.
Any help?
PS. Great work on three.js, keep it up!
