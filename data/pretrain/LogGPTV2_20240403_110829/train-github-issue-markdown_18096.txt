I'm attempting to create a `THREE.Object3D` group that includes both a `THREE.Line` and a `THREE.Mesh`. Here is the code I am using:

```javascript
var line = new THREE.Line(text3d, lineMaterial);
var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(text3d, faceMaterial);
var group = new THREE.Object3D();
group.add(line);
group.add(mesh);
```

However, only the `line` is being rendered in the scene. If I change the order of adding the objects to the group, such as adding the `mesh` before the `line`, then only the `mesh` is rendered.

I would like both the `line` and the `mesh` to be rendered simultaneously. Can anyone provide some guidance on how to achieve this?

Additionally, I want to commend the work on three.js; it's an excellent library! Keep up the great work!
