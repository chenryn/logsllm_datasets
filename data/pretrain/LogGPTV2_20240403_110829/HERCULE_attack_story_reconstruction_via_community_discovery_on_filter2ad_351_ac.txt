in is the sum of the weights of the edges inside C where the
w Av,w denotes the sum of the weights
v is moved to, kv =
connected to the node w,
tot is the sum of the weights of
the connections to all the nodes in the community C, kv,in is
the sum of the weights of the links to node v in community C
and m is the total weights of all the edges in the graph. This
process is the ﬁrst phase, and it is applied repeatedly and
sequentially to all nodes until no modularity increase occurs.
Then the second phase begins once the algorithm reaches
the local optimum of modularity. In the second phase, the
algorithm aggregates all of the nodes in the same community
into one node and builds a new network. The links between
nodes within the same community are then represented by
self-linked edges on the new community node. The second
phase ends once the network reconstruction ﬁnishes, and
the ﬁrst phase then starts the next iteration on the new
network.
4. EVALUATION
Implementation. We have implemented HERCULE in
Python and use Matlab for the learning algorithms. We
leverage Python’s implementation of the Louvain method
package python-louvain [39] for community detection. The
weight assignment algorithms are implemented using Matlab
quadprog [43] for quadratic programming, LIBSVM [38] for soft
margin SVM and Matlab glmfit [42] for logistic regression.
Our evaluation environment consists of: (1) A Windows
victim system running on a machine with an Intel Core i5-
3570 3.40 GHz CPU, 4GB RAM and Windows 7 Ultimate
Service Pack 1 64-bit operating system. (2) A Linux victim
system runs on the machine with Intel Core i5-4200M 2.50
GHz CPU, 4GB RAM and Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS 64-bit op-
erating system. (3) The attacker runs on a machine with
Intel Core i5-4200M 2.50 GHz CPU, 4GB RAM and the Kali
Linux 64-bit operating system. The attacker’s machine also
serves diﬀerent roles, such as the C&C server, the FTP server
for downloading attack tools, the samba server for sharing
ﬁles, and Apache server for hosting malicious websites.
