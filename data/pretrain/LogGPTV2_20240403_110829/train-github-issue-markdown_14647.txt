### Describe your issue.
I'm inconsistently getting a RuntimeWarning from scipy, seemingly only after
running a matplotlib plotting function. This isn't really a problem for me,
but it is weird and I didn't see it referenced anywhere so I figured I would
at least raise an issue.
I don't get the runtime error if I just run `beta.pdf(xs, 1.2, 1.8)` outside
the plotting function. In general the error seems to appear inconsistently,
and I'm not entirely sure how to characterise the conditions accurately.
This is possibly related to #13364, since this comment has the same error from
some tests. I am also on an M1 mac, and using the miniforge version of scipy).
### Reproducing Code Example
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from scipy.stats import beta
    import numpy as np
    xs = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
    plt.plot(xs, beta.pdf(xs, 1.2, 1.8))
    beta.ppf(0.01, 1.2, 1.8)
### Error message
    /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniforge/base/envs/smokey/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scipy/stats/_continuous_distns.py:624: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in _beta_ppf
