User: i have a doubt, i need to create some svg files (in a sequence) and upload to data store. I know how to create the svg, but it save to filesystem, and i have understood that GAE cannot use it. 
So, i don't know how to create and put it on the datastore.
Assistant: Create your "file" in memory (use e.g io.BytesIO) and then use the getvalue method of the in-memory "file" to get the blob of bytes for the datastore. Do note that a datastore entity is limited to a megabyte or so, thus it's quite possible that some SVG file might not fit in that space -- in which case, you should look into Google Cloud Storage. But, that's a different issue.
