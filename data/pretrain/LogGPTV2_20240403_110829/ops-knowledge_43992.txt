User: I created a script that will tell me what to wear in the morning based on the weather (i.e. rain slicker if it will rain, heavy jacket if it will be cold, etc).  I have fairly basic programming experience with python and the script works perfectly, but I want to be able to create a file that I can just double-click from my desktop and the script will automatically run.
My goal is to be able to simply double click [something] in the morning and it will automatically run the script and thus tell me what to wear.  How could I go about doing this?
System Specifications:

python
Mac OSX
Assistant: In Linux/unix based OS ,  add #!/usr/bin/python3 line on top  of your script file with extension .py , if you have python version 3. Or change it to the version installed in the machine
Further , make the file executable by
sudo chmod +x <fileName>
for windows, add windows python path and make the file executable
