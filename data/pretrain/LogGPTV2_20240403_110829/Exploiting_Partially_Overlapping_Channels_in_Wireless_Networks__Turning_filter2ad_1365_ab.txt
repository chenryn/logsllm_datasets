a number of inefﬁciencies, and other dynamic and dis-
tributed approaches have been proposed [4, 5]. Here we
show using a simple example how partially overlapping
channels can yield improved network throughput and can
be complimentary to existing channel assignment meth-
ods.
Consider the WLAN setup shown in Figure 2. The
dashed circle shows the size of an AP’s cell or the basic
service set (BSS). This region is the distance upto which
a transmission from either the AP or a client associated to
the AP would interfere with stations on the same chan-
nel as the AP (circular ranges for ease of illustration).
There are four APs whose BSS have reasonable overlap.
Network administrators would organize APs in this man-
ner so as to maximize total coverage while allowing rea-
sonable overlap for handoffs to occur. If there are large
number of clients in the common region of overlap, the
four APs would need to be assigned to different chan-
nels. Such constraints are typically captured in a graph
theoretic manner as shown in the ﬁgure, and channel as-
signment becomes the well-known graph coloring prob-
lem. The example of Figure 2 becomes a 4-clique, which
needs four channels to eliminate interference from neigh-
boring APs. This is impossible to achieve in the 802.11b
system, which has only 3 non-overlapping channels.
Instead of using 3 non-overlapping channels, the APs
could use partially-overlapped channels, e.g., 1, 4, 7 and
11. The partial overlap among these channels would
be sufﬁcient to degrade the signal below an acceptable
level so as to not cause interference. This is conceptually
viewed as reducing the interference range of a BSS by
a certain factor as observed by a receiver on a neighbor-
ing channel – the extent of overlap among two channels
which we deﬁned as the I-factor. Note that the range
of a BSS itself (as viewed in the same channel) is not
altered. Hence clients associated with this AP see no
difference in performance, while clients of neighboring
APs on partially overlapped channels see reduced inter-
ference. Thus, by using these four partially overlapping

channels, the respective BSS get rid of any interference
from neighboring APs
Below we discuss a systematic method for taking ad-
vantage of the partially overlapping channels in an algo-
rithmic manner. We note that at this point this is work-
in-progress as we work towards a full-ﬂedged solution:
Let k denote the total number of non-overlapping
channels available in the underlying wireless PHY layer.
Given a region of interest covered with a set of access
points, deﬁne an overlap graph G = (V, E) as follows:
V = {ap1, ap2, . . . , apn} be the set of n APs that form
the network. Place an edge between APs api and apj
(api 6= apj) if the users associated to the respective APs
or the APs themselves interfere (indicating spatial over-
lap in region of coverage).
Assume we are given a channel assignment that uses
the 3 non-overlapping channels in 802.11b. This assign-
ment could have been performed using LCCS or other
techniques [5]. Reﬂect the channel assignment onto the
above constructed overlap graph. We say that an edge
(api, apj) is a conﬂict edge if there is interference be-
tween the respective APs – i.e.
they are assigned the
same channel. Consider such a conﬂict edge (api, apj).
Note that both api and apj, have neighbors utilizing the
other two channels (else this conﬂict can be removed).
Now, we apply the partially overlapping channels to this
subgraph formed by api, apj and all neighbors of api and
apj, we observe if the partial overlap can reduce the in-
terference (as discussed in the example above). This in-
tuition can be used to algorithmically use partially over-
lapping channels.
Next, we discuss detailed experimental results which
show improved spatial reuse of spectrum using partially
overlapping channels.

3.1 Experiments to demonstrate spatial
reuse
To demonstrate how partially overlapping channels can
be used to improve reuse of the RF spectrum, we con-
sider the following setup. Two APs and two stations
(STA), with one STA associated to each AP, take part
in the experiments. One such AP-STA pair, called Pair-
A, is kept ﬁxed at a particular location within an ofﬁce
building, while the other Pair-B is moved to various dif-
ferent locations of measurement. The distance between
an AP and its associated STA is kept constant throughout
the experiment process.
The following parameters are varied to study the ef-
fect of using partially overlapping channels on TCP/UDP
throughput and MAC level collisions: The distance be-
tween the AP-STA pairs is varied to study the interfer-

were performed. The datarate here was set at 11 Mbps.
Figure 5 shows the number of collisions that occurred
at the AP-STA Pair-B. The number of collisions have a
signiﬁcant amount of variation from one execution of the
experiment to another because of the randomness present
in the MAC protocol. However, clearly noticeable is the
fact that a drastic reduction in the number of collisions
(as shown by the cutoff at around 100 in Figure 5) in-
dicates signiﬁcant reduction in interference. Thus, the
points at which each curve takes a plunge below the cut-
off line (shown in the ﬁgure) indicates the distance at
which interference does not occur between the two AP-
STA pairs.
Figure 6 shows the effect of the 802.11 MAC datarate
on the interference range of a BSS. Each point on a
curve plots the minimum observed distance (modulo dis-
crete observation points) on the y-axis at which with the
given channel separation (x-axis) the two AP-STA pairs
do not interfere with each other and attain the maxi-
mum possible TCP/UDP throughput – which is the in-
terference range of the BSS formed by an AP-STA pair.
One observes that for all three datarates, the interference
range decreases consistently. Also as expected, for a
given amount of channel overlap, a higher datarate has
a smaller interference range.
Figure 7 shows graphically the interference ranges for
channel separation of zero (same channel), 2 and 4 at
a datarate of 2 Mbps. This visually demonstrates how
spatial reuse can be signiﬁcantly improved by carefully
employing partially overlapping channels.
4 Applications to Mesh Networks
Proper channel assignment and routing are important to
utilize the full capacity of a mesh network. Channel as-
signment affects the topology that is available to the rout-
ing infrastructure and these problems are addressed in
tandem with each other [6, 2, 8, 3]. Also, there are tech-
niques which utilizes a single wireless card to connect
to multiple networks by constantly switching channels
[1]. Partially overlapping channels that allow communi-
cation with nodes operating on different non-overlapping
channels can yield signiﬁcant advantages in such set-
tings. They can be employed to connect to multiple net-
works, or to add ﬂexibility to the routing infrastructure
by creating additional edges in the mesh network topol-
ogy. Below we demonstrate simple experiments which
show how two nodes operating on partially overlapping
channels can communicate with each other.
We conduct the following simple experiment: Two
nodes are placed on channels with decreasing overlap,
and the UDP throughput is measured. One node was kept
ﬁxed on channel 6, while the other was progressively
moved from channel 1 through 11. The nodes were con-

ence range of the BSS formed by the pair. The datarate
used for communication was chosen from the following
permissible instantaneous data rates: 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbps
(note, throughputs will be lower). The channel separa-
tion, which refers to the difference in the channel num-
bers used by the two pairs, is varied between 0 and 5.
For each selection of the parameters, we monitored TCP
and UDP throughputs for ﬂows lasting 10 seconds. The
MAC level collisions were also monitored. All APs and
STAs used wireless NICs from the same vendor with a
constant transmit power of 30mW.
Figure 3(a) plots the UDP throughput achieved by the
AP-STA Pair-B against distance from Pair-A. This ex-
periment used a datarate of 2 Mbps which best shows
how a step by step decrease in overlap increases the AP-
STA throughput (other datarates omitted due to space re-
strictions). Figure shows that using the same channel, a
distance of around 50 feet would be necessary to elim-
inate the interference and attain the maximum possible
throughput. This throughput is attained for much smaller
distances as the channel separation (indicated by the leg-
end ChSep) is increased from 0 (same channel ) to 5
(non-overlapping channels). Figure 3(b) shows the same
effect on TCP throughput. Figure 3(c) shows the TCP
throughput in a second environment, which is an ofﬁce

at distances of 15 and 30 feet between the two nodes.
The plots demonstrate how a partially overlapping chan-
nels can be used to communicate at the cost of reduction
in the throughput. This allows a node with a single inter-
face to communicate with nodes on two non-overlapping
channels by operating on a channel that partially overlaps
with both.
Figure 8: Throughput versus channel separation.
Figure 9: Example multihop scenario.
Throughput improvements using partially overlap-
ping channels: Apart from utilizing partially overlap-
ping channels for topology ﬂexibility in mesh settings,
they can be applied to improve the throughput capac-
ity of multi-hop networks. Consider the multihop setup
shown in Figure 9. There are four nodes; each with a
single radio interface. Because of this limitation, techni-
cally the network can utilize only one channel or the net-
work would get partitioned. Say, nodes A, B and C are
within communication range of each other. Nodes D and
E are each within communication range of nodes A,B
and C. The transmission ranges of nodes A,B and C are
shown using dashed circles. With all nodes operating on
a single channel to prevent network partition, each node
shares the channel with two other nodes, thus achieving
roughly 1/3rd of the maximum available bandwidth on
one channel.
Now, using partially overlapping channels, an assign-
ment can be performed as follows. Nodes A and E are
assigned channel 1; nodes B and D are on channel 6.
These links do not interfere with each other. Node C is be
placed on channel 4, which allows communication with
both A and B. Channel 4 is chosen such that the reduction
in the communication range as determined by the extent
of overlap between h4, 6i and h4, 1i allows communica-
tion with both A and B. The network thus utilizes the
maximum bandwidth available on two non-overlapping
channels and hence this can result in signiﬁcant through-
put improvements.
5 Summary
Through testbed measurements we have evaluated how
partial overlap in channels can be exploited for improved
spatial re-use (WLANs) and the ability to do multi-
channel communication (Mesh). The focus of this paper
has really been to add a new mechanism to our toolkit for
spectrum management — partially overlapped channels.
We believe this paper is merely the ﬁrst step towards de-
sign of new and efﬁcient algorithms that are aware of the
potential demonstrated. In particular it would be possible
to re-visit each channel assignment technique designed
in the past and examine how they can be extended by
employing this new mechanism.
