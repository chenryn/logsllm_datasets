Couldn’t address everything with SPI
• Additional considerations 
–Willingness and ability to purchase additional 
tools
–Specific expertise and skills of the analyst
• A scripting heavy method may be more effective 
for an expert scripter than the SPI predicts
–Type of environments needed for specific 
methods
• Such as mobile examination or a windows only 
shop
SPI vs. Expert
• Again, the expert has experience with success 
and failures of methods, missed deadlines, 
and empirical data on the processing time 
required for various methods.
• Determining the “best bang for the buck” has 
become second nature
• Already has an intuitive understanding of the 
best methods for the specific case goals
Framework for Structured Analysis 
Time
• Two factors in time estimation component of SPI:
– Data size, e.g. web history small is under 1000 
relevant records @ 1 hour
– Skill level, with a choice of novice, experienced, and 
expert for each method
• Provides the ability to budget time based on 
expected results
– If time exceeds the estimate by 20%, then this should 
force a revaluation of the method used.
• Provides a systematic time management strategy 
unique to the case
Case Studies using SPM
• You’ve made it past the dry methodology, so 
hopefully this is more entertaining
• Case studies are made up of real cases, 
sanitized and cleared by our lawyers
• Should represent the value of SPM as we walk 
through the phases of the case
Intellectual Property
•
Case Background
– Employee left and started a competing business
– Employee hire dates and “last date”
– Employee was assigned workstation
•
Case Type
– Intellectual Property case type includes analysis of systems, media, 
and network traffic for the use and misuse of proprietary data and is 
usually associated to the identification and verifications of documents, 
ideas, and concepts of the requesting organization. While it is not the 
analyst’s responsibility to interpret laws that determine unfair 
business practices or the violation of regulations, the analyst may be 
required to make the associations of proprietary information and 
derivative work. This case type typically includes keyword searches for 
key terms, system use analysis, and discovery of method that may 
have been used to transfer information. Intellectual property case 
types can also include external sources in conjunction with protective 
orders and analysis of similar work products that may be derivative of 
other work.
Meeting with Requester
• Initial Meeting
– Requester wants to know if any business protected information 
was taken
• Specifically contacts and vendor lists
• SPM Common Case Goals for Intellectual Property 
– Identification of specific documents
– Identification of specific parts of documents
– Identification of system use based around documents or time
– Identification of external transfer methods, such as USB drives 
or network uploading.
– Identification of documents based on keyword searches for 
ideas, concepts, and known terms
– Validation and opinion of derivative work
Agreement of Goals
– Agreement of goals
• Emails to and from identified contacts or mail domains
• Identification of USB devices that have attached to the 
system
• Identify system usage for selected time periods
– Link files, registry files, timelines of use
• Locate all copies of selected documents
– Both full copies and selected parts of documents
• Identify documents based on keywords
– Keywords provided by requester
Analyst’s Potential Additional Goals
• Extract instant message logs
• Recover deleted files
• Memory Analysis
• Convert identified persons of interest into 
common usernames (instant massage, 
personal email account, etc)
Case Information
• Based on Case Goals
– Required information
• Keywords / mail domains for email analysis
• Keywords for document identification
• Documents to be located
• Copies of documents to be searched for
• System Images
– Beneficial Information
• Full case background or timeline of events
• Work-product names / external associated names
• Specific dates and times 
Pre-Analysis Time Estimation
• 5 Goals, removing some duplication
– Email analysis
– Registry analysis
– Identification of files
– Extract files for analysis, recover delete files
– Identify system usage
• Pre-analysis estimate of 28.5 hours required
Common Methods
– Intellectual Property Common Methods include
• Hash files for matches
• Fuzzy hash for partial matches
• Extract files from container files
• Extract mail
• Registry analysis for system usage
• Registry timeline
• System usage timeline (super timeline, log files)
• USB analysis
• Network PCAP analysis
• Extract metadata
• Recover deleted files
• Keyword index and analysis
• Extract IM
• OCR graphic formats for text indexing
Methods to Goals IP Case
• Case Goals -> Methods
– Extraction of emails for analysis 
• SPI: 3,222 estimated time 80 minutes
– Hash files for identification and location 
• SPI: 2,457 estimated time 260 minutes
– Fuzzy Hash files for identification and location 
• SPI: 2,643 estimated time 280 minutes
– Recover deleted files 
• SPI 3,052 estimated time 225 minutes
Methods to Goals IP Case
• Case Goals -> Methods
– Identification of system usage
• Registry analysis,  SPI 2,707 @ est 45 minutes
• Super Timeline Analysis, SPI 2,257 @ est 5 hours
• Link File analysis, SPI 1,395 @ est 75 minutes
• Web History analysis, SPI 2,527 @ est 115 minutes
• Analysis of IM / Carve IM logs, SPI 1,410 @ est 60 
minutes
So, what did we find?
• Hashing and filename search results as expected
– Located the identified documents in emails, on 
internal and external drives, in LNK files, hits in 
registry for recent
– Hash match lead to a zip file with the name “needed 
for XXXXXXXX.zip” – name of the new competitor
– Fuzzy hashing found slightly altered copies, including  
copies with the new competitor’s name and letter 
head.  This lead to directories that contained slightly 
changed to updated overhauls of company processes 
and procedures
Email Extraction
• Extracted and processed email was interesting
– Used original keywords and associated names to 
develop a dictionary of all individuals associated, 
abbreviations of the new competitor, and  locations 
from the email threads / IM logs / web mail
– Developed a timeline that was amazing, from initial 
contact, follow-up, offer sent in FedEx, last- minute 
negotiations, discussions of exit strategies and how to 
approach difficult questions, and status of remaining 
days before the “last day”
– Web mail artifacts included discussions of pros and 
cons with a significant other,  purchase of equipment 
for a new home office on the negotiated “work from 
home day”.
Deleted Files and Keywords
• Processed deleted files and performed 
keyword searches.
– Updated dictionary with IM usernames, personal 
email addresses,  and associated derivatives
– Mediocre free space results, it is always difficult 
for me to justify using free space either for 
searching or to corroborate results from other 
methods
– Keyword documents did not generate any follow-
up searches or additional analysis
System Usage
• Registry analysis usually has a great SPI!
– Generated reports on all registries, including restore 
points.
– Tons of supporting data for accessing files
– Tied LNK files to USB drives, showed transfer to 
external USB keys
• Super Timeline Analysis
– Didn’t exist at the time, but would have a good SPI 
based on high effectiveness, more machine time than 
analyst time, and low cost.
– We didn’t have that, so we broke out the sources that 
were most relevant and custom scripted a merge.
System Usage (2)
• Analyzed web history, recovered deleted 
histories, rendered HTML cache files.
– Good approach because it showed a lot of activity 
not in the interest of the organization
– A little porn… NOT little people porn!
• Recovered IM chats and carved deleted chats
– Great conversations trashing the organization, key 
individuals, and friends
– Discussions of who to attempt to “take” to the 
new company
Conclusions
• Met all of the requester’s goals
– Had defendable data and conclusions
– Rechecked primary findings with multiple tools
– Happy client, no follow-up required
• Personal Conclusions
– This guy fills out the ID10T forms in triplicate
– Does he own a home PC?  CCleaner?  Eraser?
– Truecrypt? Zip 8.0 AES encryption?
Judging Your Performance
• Feedback can be shaky sometimes, based on how 
well you found the answers that were wanted by 
the requester
• I use the following metrics in weighted order
– The number of follow-up questions from the data in 
your report, i.e. how well they understood your 
presentation of the findings
– Number of goals the requester really wanted that you 
were unable to draw out of them
– Amount of estimated time vs. total time (adjusted for 
unusual circumstances)
– Total predicted value vs. actual value to the requester
– Number of “wrong turns” or undisciplined searching
Presentation Conclusions
• Even if you don’t fully invest into the 
methodology, you will still gain from
– Defining better case goals with your requester
– Improved familiarity with common goals of your 
primary case types
– Mentally organizing methods with a “best bang for 
the buck” mentality
– Developing internal time management for 
reevaluation of your methods to achieve your case 
goals

Forensic Thoughts
• I like building dictionaries of account names, 
email addresses, and additional keywords from 
examinations.
– Allows an overall priority for additional searching
– Reduces the temptation to get lost in unguided and 
unfocused searching
• Keeping the case goals/SPI/common methods 
handy
– I like to print them out and scribble status and notes 
as I go
– Helps prevent case goal “over-kill” and optimize 
efforts
• After a couple of cases that had reporting 
deadlines, I now include raw data as appendixes
