#### Formula for Estimating Costs
- **Excel / Open Office / Google Apps:**
  - `=LOG((1/(1-effectiveness)),2)*1000 - (machineTime + 2 * personTime + 1.5 * additionalCost)`

#### Limitations of SPI
- **SPI Considerations:**
  - **Willingness and Ability to Purchase Additional Tools:**
    - The willingness and ability to acquire additional tools can impact the effectiveness of the analysis.
  - **Specific Expertise and Skills of the Analyst:**
    - A method that is heavily reliant on scripting may be more effective for an expert scripter than what the SPI predicts.
  - **Type of Environments:**
    - The type of environment, such as mobile examination or a Windows-only shop, can influence the choice of methods.

#### SPI vs. Expert Analysis
- **Expert Experience:**
  - An expert has experience with the successes and failures of different methods, missed deadlines, and empirical data on the processing time required for various methods.
  - Determining the "best bang for the buck" has become second nature.
  - They have an intuitive understanding of the best methods for specific case goals.

#### Framework for Structured Analysis Time
- **Time Estimation Factors:**
  - **Data Size:**
    - For example, web history with fewer than 1,000 relevant records is estimated at 1 hour.
  - **Skill Level:**
    - Skill levels are categorized as novice, experienced, and expert for each method.
  - **Budgeting Time:**
    - If the actual time exceeds the estimate by 20%, it should prompt a reevaluation of the method used.
  - **Systematic Time Management:**
    - Provides a unique, systematic time management strategy tailored to the specific case.

#### Case Studies Using SPM
- **Introduction:**
  - After the detailed methodology, the case studies aim to be more engaging.
  - These studies are based on real cases, sanitized and approved by legal teams.
  - They illustrate the value of SPM as we walk through the phases of the case.

#### Intellectual Property Case
- **Case Background:**
  - An employee left the company to start a competing business.
  - Key details include hire dates, last date, and assigned workstation.
- **Case Type:**
  - **Intellectual Property:**
    - Involves analyzing systems, media, and network traffic to identify and verify the use and misuse of proprietary data.
    - Includes keyword searches, system use analysis, and identifying transfer methods.
    - May involve external sources and protective orders, and the analysis of similar work products.

#### Meeting with the Requester
- **Initial Meeting:**
  - The requester wants to know if any protected business information, specifically contacts and vendor lists, was taken.
- **Common Case Goals:**
  - Identification of specific documents and parts of documents.
  - Identification of system use related to documents or time.
  - Identification of external transfer methods (e.g., USB drives, network uploading).
  - Keyword searches for ideas, concepts, and known terms.
  - Validation and opinion on derivative work.

#### Agreement of Goals
- **Goals:**
  - Emails to and from identified contacts or mail domains.
  - Identification of USB devices attached to the system.
  - System usage for selected time periods (link files, registry files, timelines).
  - Locating all copies of selected documents.
  - Identifying documents based on provided keywords.

#### Analyst’s Potential Additional Goals
- **Additional Goals:**
  - Extract instant message logs.
  - Recover deleted files.
  - Perform memory analysis.
  - Convert identified persons of interest into common usernames (e.g., instant messaging, personal email accounts).

#### Case Information
- **Required Information:**
  - Keywords and mail domains for email analysis.
  - Keywords for document identification.
  - Documents to be located.
  - Copies of documents to be searched.
  - System images.
- **Beneficial Information:**
  - Full case background or timeline of events.
  - Work-product names and external associated names.
  - Specific dates and times.

#### Pre-Analysis Time Estimation
- **Estimated Time:**
  - 5 goals, removing some duplication, with a pre-analysis estimate of 28.5 hours.
- **Common Methods:**
  - Hash files for matches.
  - Fuzzy hash for partial matches.
  - File extraction from container files.
  - Email extraction.
  - Registry analysis for system usage.
  - Timeline analysis.
  - USB analysis.
  - Network PCAP analysis.
  - Metadata extraction.
  - Deleted file recovery.
  - Keyword indexing and analysis.
  - Instant message extraction.
  - OCR for graphic formats.

#### Methods to Goals in IP Case
- **Case Goals to Methods:**
  - **Email Extraction:**
    - SPI: 3,222, estimated time 80 minutes.
  - **File Identification:**
    - Hash files: SPI 2,457, estimated time 260 minutes.
    - Fuzzy hash files: SPI 2,643, estimated time 280 minutes.
  - **Deleted File Recovery:**
    - SPI 3,052, estimated time 225 minutes.
  - **System Usage:**
    - Registry analysis: SPI 2,707, estimated time 45 minutes.
    - Super Timeline Analysis: SPI 2,257, estimated time 5 hours.
    - Link File analysis: SPI 1,395, estimated time 75 minutes.
    - Web History analysis: SPI 2,527, estimated time 115 minutes.
    - IM/Carve IM logs: SPI 1,410, estimated time 60 minutes.

#### Findings
- **Hashing and Filename Search:**
  - Located identified documents in emails, internal and external drives, LNK files, and registry hits.
  - Found a zip file named “needed for XXXXXXXX.zip” with the new competitor's name.
  - Fuzzy hashing revealed slightly altered copies, including documents with the new competitor’s name and letterhead.
- **Email Extraction:**
  - Developed a dictionary of individuals, abbreviations, and locations from email threads, IM logs, and web mail.
  - Created a timeline from initial contact to final negotiations.
- **Deleted Files and Keywords:**
  - Updated dictionary with IM usernames, personal email addresses, and associated derivatives.
  - Mediocre free space results; keyword documents did not generate follow-up searches.
- **System Usage:**
  - **Registry Analysis:**
    - Generated reports on all registries, including restore points.
    - Tied LNK files to USB drives, showing transfers to external USB keys.
  - **Super Timeline Analysis:**
    - Custom scripted a merge due to the lack of a super timeline tool.
  - **Web History:**
    - Recovered and rendered HTML cache files, showing activity not in the organization's interest.
