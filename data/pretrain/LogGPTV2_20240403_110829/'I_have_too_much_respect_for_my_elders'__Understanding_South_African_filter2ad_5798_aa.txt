Abstract
Facebook usage is growing in developing countries, but we
know little about how to tailor social media privacy settings to
users in less well-resourced settings. To that end, we present
ﬁndings from interviews of 52 current mobile social me-
dia users in South Africa. We found users’ primary privacy-
related concern was who else could see their posts and mes-
sages, not what data the platforms or advertisers collect about
them. Second, users displayed general knowledge gaps on
existing social media privacy settings and relied heavily on
blocking and passwords for privacy and security protection.
Third, users’ privacy and security-related behaviors were heav-
ily inﬂuenced by living in high-crime areas. Based on these
ﬁndings, we suggest future work to better serve users’ privacy
and security needs in less well-resourced settings.
1 Introduction
There are an estimated 139 million Facebook users in Africa
and the most popular messaging app on the African continent
is WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook [34, 50, 58]. Most of
these users are on mobile only and may be unaware of pri-
vacy issues [22, 34], thus making them more vulnerable to
exploitation of their data [53, 69]. Yet most of the research on
how users manage privacy on Facebook has been undertaken
in more well resourced countries and has not focused on low
income users speciﬁcally [10, 63]. This is signiﬁcant, since in
developing contexts in many African countries, many other
factors such as costly data plans, issues of device ownership
and phone sharing, and differences in culture inﬂuence so-
cial media users’ privacy [44, 48, 68, 69]. Several researchers
have been investigating social media usage in Ghana, Kenya,
India, parts of South Asia, parts of the Arab gulf, and South
Africa including Facebook and Free Basics usage, the zero-
rated platform for applications—meaning users do not have
to pay for data costs for using these applications—made by
Facebook [3, 53, 56, 57, 75–78]. Although these studies fo-
cus on low income users, fewer focus speciﬁcally on how
users manage their privacy on these social media applications.
Given the fact that privacy is a very culturally bound con-

cept [5, 15, 68, 69] and to avoid over-generalizing from one
marginalized community to another, it is important to under-
stand how users in South Africa approach the management
of privacy and privacy settings on Facebook and its related
applications [44]. Moreover, the ‘privacy paradox’ suggests
users’ privacy concerns may not be correlated with actual
privacy protecting behaviors; thus, studying current social me-
dia behaviors which are better correlated with users’ privacy
valuations is crucial [8, 12, 52]. Doing so can help inform the
design of privacy settings for users whose needs may not have
been accounted for [67].
To investigate how resource-constrained mobile users per-
ceive and manage their privacy on social media, we conducted
a qualitative study with 52 mobile social media users in Cape
Town, South Africa. We focused our study on the Facebook
suite of apps—Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Free Ba-
sics, (a platform for applications including Facebook Lite,
Messenger Lite, and others)—since they are the most popu-
lar apps in South Africa, particularly amongst low income
users [53]. Our goals were to better understand users’ mental
models of privacy, what data privacy options are available to
them, and their social media consumption patterns. We also
aimed to develop recommendations for improving privacy and
potentially security controls for these users speciﬁcally. We
had three research questions: (1)What are South African mo-
bile social media users’ privacy concerns?, (2) How do users
currently manage privacy on social media?, and (3) What
factors inﬂuence users’ current behaviors on social media?.
We have three main ﬁndings. First, we found that users’
principal privacy concerns regarded who had access to in-
formation they considered private as opposed to platforms
collecting data about them. In particular, users were mindful
of ‘elders’ and others and how they presented themselves
online. Users also perceived WhatsApp as more private than
Facebook because they understood the settings and felt the
audience on the platform was more under their control. Sec-
ond, much like in more well resourced settings [68], we found
that users had very little knowledge of available privacy set-
tings or how to use them. Unlike in more developed settings,

their primary method of protecting privacy was via blocking
people or controlling what they posted or via passwords on
shared devices, as opposed to relying on granular privacy set-
tings [15]. Third, unlike more developed settings, we found
evidence that users’ concerns for physical safety strongly im-
pacted when and what they posted on social media. High
crime, phone sharing, and theft also inﬂuenced account hack-
ing, what content they encountered, and how they used social
media to store their data. Based on these ﬁndings, we make
recommendations to better address the privacy and security
needs of mobile users in high-crime settings.
We make two contributions. The ﬁrst is providing evidence
of how low income users in South Africa manage privacy
on Facebook and WhatsApp, which adds to a growing set of
literature on privacy behaviors on social media in other low-
income countries and regions including Ghana, parts of South
Asia, Saudi Arabia, and parts of the Arab Gulf [3, 13, 51, 57].
This evidence provides novel insights about how cultural and
ﬁnancial differences affect privacy management in marginal-
ized communities and how South African concerns compare
to those of users in various resource-constrained nations. The
second contribution is providing recommendations for how to
address user needs for privacy management in marginalized
communities in high-crime settings, again building on unique
insights from South Africa, such as data costs limiting users’
explorations of privacy settings, and user concerns around
physical safety affecting posting on social media. In the rest
of this paper: Section 2 explores prior work, Section 3 and 4
detail the methods used and our ﬁndings. Finally, Section 5
discusses the implications of our ﬁndings for marginalized
users’ social media privacy needs1.
2 Related Work
2.1 Social Media And Privacy Breaches
With the rise of social media usage, social media compa-
nies have found new ways to monetize their users’ data [25],
including by encroaching on user privacy with methods rang-
ing from allowing third-party app access to user informa-
tion to massive data collection by the platforms themselves
[20, 30, 71]. This "Big Data" era has brought along with it a
renewed emphasis on data privacy. Facebook has been in the
spotlight a number of times recently for major data breaches
and how it treats user privacy. For instance, in 2018, after a
major backlash from users about data breaches at Facebook
through Cambridge Analytica, Facebook executives Sheryl
Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg testiﬁed in front of the United
States Congress about the use of data in targeted advertising
during the 2016 United States presidential election [62]. Even
after such testimony, many calls for social media sites to im-
prove the way they handle user data remain unanswered.
1There are currently no guidelines for respectful writing on resource-
constrained settings but we strived to present our work respectfully draw-
ing inspiration from http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/november-
december-2015/writing-about-accessibility.
In late December 2018, a New York Times exposé [17] re-
vealed that Facebook had been giving other major companies,
such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Spotify, access to private
messages sent through Facebook’s Messenger application.
Other social media sites have also been at the helm of contro-
versy over privacy breaches. For instance, a few weeks after
the Facebook Messenger app story broke, a massive security
ﬂaw in Google’s social media site, Google+, was reported to
have exposed the data of more than 52 million users [45]. A
Wall Street Journal investigation later showed that Google had
known about this bug for more than three years, but feared the
repercussions of revealing it to the public [39]. Despite me-
dia attention, discussion regarding these events has not been
about protecting the end users themselves, but rather, has been
largely surrounding the notion that technology conglomerates
have grown too powerful by using consumer data.
Additionally, it is increasingly evident that social media
users are not even aware of the vast data collection done by
companies. A study [29] conducted by the Pew Research
Center found that only 12% of adult Facebook users were
aware that Facebook maintained a list of their interests and
identiﬁable traits. Once informed, however, 82% expressed
at least some level of unease about a company collecting
this information about them. Further, researchers found [6]
that the mechanisms Facebook currently uses to inform users
about data collection in an effort for transparency, such as the
“ad preference” page and the “why am I seeing this?” button,
give users misleading or erroneous explanations about the
data Facebook has collected about them. Thus, users often
lack knowledge about data privacy practices on social media.
2.2 Facebook And Privacy Studies
Ironically, while stories about breaches of digital privacy con-
tinue to populate daily news outlets and an increasing number
of countries are passing laws protecting user data privacy [26],
researchers have found that the users in developed countries
have not been taking many measures to protect their data.
Users continue to post and upload large amounts of personal
information, despite claiming high levels of knowledge of pri-
vacy issues [19,65]. Users do, however, use various strategies
such as self-censorship and information control to manage
their privacy as found by Cho and Filippova who studied hun-
dreds of users in the United States and Singapore to see how
they manage privacy on Facebook [14, 15]. Some studies also
focus on how users perceive data collection and privacy from
third-party apps on Facebook [35, 72]. Notably, most existing
studies of Facebook and privacy have been conducted in de-
veloped countries such as the United States [9, 31, 37, 61, 73],
and Canada [79]. Additionally, many studies relied only on
student populations. Thus this vast literature is not necessarily
representative of users privacy behaviors in developing coun-
tries who may be mobile only, experience high data costs, or
engage in phone sharing [4, 40, 53].
However, there is a growing amount of research on how
1950    29th USENIX Security Symposium

users in developing countries use social media platforms.
Some studies have focused broadly on Internet use, such as in
Bangladesh [11] and Havana [21], or the use of voice social
media platforms for blind users in India. These studies have
conﬁrmed that users in less-resourced settings use social me-
dia platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, often
by consuming content more so than posting. Yet, these studies
have not not focused on how users manage privacy on these
platforms speciﬁcally. Others focus on privacy attitudes and
privacy on mobile phones in India and other countries in South
Asia or on how social media users experience online abuse,
without speciﬁc focus on privacy management [36,56,57,70].
2.2.1 Social Media Use and Non-Use
There are also studies speciﬁcally on social media usage and
non-use. For instance, Miller conducted a year-long study of
Facebook in Trinidad [43]. In another study, Wyche et. al [77]
found that in a low-income neighborhood in Nairobi, Kenya,
Facebook was mostly used for purposes of income generation
and supplementation such as looking for job opportunities or
marketing oneself. A different study done in Kenya by the
same researchers [78] found that usage of Facebook was de-
sired, but limited. Low income users’ minimal Facebook use
often took place at Internet cafes, as participants either did not
have the ﬁnancial resources to spend money on mobile data
plans or encountered infrastructural challenges such as power
outages, low-bandwidth, and limited Internet connectivity. In
a third study by Wyche [75] in a Nairobi slum, she found
that often women were harassed online on Facebook. All
of these studies were done in Kenya. Some researchers also
studied urban users’ [13] perception of online security threats
in Ghana. They found that at least 26% of 193 respondents
reported using at least one Facebook privacy setting.
2.2.2 Privacy and Social Media In Marginalized Com-
munities
A few studies do explore privacy behaviors on social media
in detail in non-African countries. This prior work suggests
users do make use of granular privacy settings to limit per-
sonal information being shared widely. One study of Saudi
Arabian WhatsApp users’ privacy behaviors [51] found that
more than half the users had used a WhatsApp privacy set-
ting and tried to hide their “Last Seen” feature on WhatsApp
(showing when a user was last online). In another study of
social media privacy in the Arab gulf [3], the researchers
found that users often had private Facebook accounts or used
post-level privacy settings to avoid bringing dishonor to their
families through exposing personal information that was not
in line with their culture or religious beliefs. Females, in
particular, struggled from unwanted contact and scrutiny on
social media. These studies shed light on privacy behaviors in
various marginalized communities, but it is unclear how these
takeaways apply to the South African context.
The study most closely related to ours examined how aware
South African college students at NorthWest University were
of South African online privacy-related legislation, such as
the Protection of Private Information Act [47]. In this survey-
based study, Nyoni and Velempini found that users did not
take advantage of many privacy features when accessing their
Facebook proﬁles. They discovered that 86% of respondents
were “not aware of the [settings or] controls that can assist
them to regulate their privacy,” such as being able to set who is
permitted to tag them in a picture, post on their wall, or prevent
their location from being shared. Further, the researchers
found [46] that 81% of those surveyed indicated that they
were unaware of the rights granted to them by South African
legislation. This study suggests that South African social
media users follow the global trend of lack of knowledge of
privacy law or practices [64].
That study had a limited focus on Facebook usage only,
and all participants were selected from individuals who had
“liked” the NorthWest University Facebook page. Our study,
by contrast, gathered data from a diverse participant pool
across a city. Furthermore, we examined Facebook privacy
management as well as its related applications. Our study adds
to this growing body of work by focusing on how low-income
South African mobile users manage privacy on Facebook and
related applications WhatsApp, Instagram, and Free Basics
through in-depth interviews with current and active users.
3 Study Method And Participants
To answer our research questions, the ﬁrst author and a local
research assistant conducted 52 in-person interviews with mo-
bile social media users in Cape Town, South Africa between
November 2018 and February 2019. The study was approved
by Princeton’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).
3.1 South African Research Context
In South Africa, there are approximately 18 million social
media users, 89% of whom browse social media exclusively
from their mobile devices [59]. An earlier study found that
these users are often resource-constrained, as data costs are
extremely expensive [40]. Additionally, the study found that
many low-income users are commonly on prepaid plans, using
up a large portion of their income on Internet use. Thus, many
users have turned to using zero-rated versions of applications
