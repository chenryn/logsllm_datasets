**Abstract:**
The use of Facebook is growing in developing countries, yet there is limited understanding of how to tailor social media privacy settings to users in resource-constrained environments. This study presents findings from interviews with 52 current mobile social media users in South Africa. Our key findings are as follows: 
1. Users' primary privacy concern was who could see their posts and messages, rather than the data collected by platforms or advertisers.
2. There were significant knowledge gaps regarding existing social media privacy settings, and users relied heavily on blocking and passwords for privacy and security.
3. Users' privacy and security behaviors were significantly influenced by living in high-crime areas.

Based on these findings, we suggest future work to better address the privacy and security needs of users in less well-resourced settings.

**1. Introduction**
Facebook has an estimated 139 million users in Africa, and WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook, is the most popular messaging app on the continent [34, 50, 58]. Most of these users access social media exclusively via mobile devices and may be unaware of privacy issues [22, 34], making them more vulnerable to data exploitation [53, 69]. However, most research on managing privacy on Facebook has been conducted in well-resourced countries and has not focused specifically on low-income users [10, 63]. In developing contexts, factors such as costly data plans, device ownership, phone sharing, and cultural differences influence social media users' privacy [44, 48, 68, 69].

Several studies have investigated social media usage in Ghana, Kenya, India, parts of South Asia, the Arab Gulf, and South Africa, including the use of Facebook and Free Basics (a zero-rated platform) [3, 53, 56, 57, 75–78]. While these studies focus on low-income users, few specifically address how users manage their privacy on these platforms. Given that privacy is culturally bound [5, 15, 68, 69], it is important to understand how users in South Africa approach privacy management on Facebook and its related applications [44]. The "privacy paradox" suggests that users' privacy concerns may not correlate with their actual behaviors, making it crucial to study current behaviors to inform the design of privacy settings [8, 12, 52].

To investigate how resource-constrained mobile users perceive and manage their privacy on social media, we conducted a qualitative study with 52 mobile social media users in Cape Town, South Africa. We focused on the Facebook suite of apps—Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Free Basics—since they are the most popular among low-income users [53]. Our goals were to understand users' mental models of privacy, available data privacy options, and social media consumption patterns, and to develop recommendations for improving privacy and security controls for these users. Our research questions were:
1. What are South African mobile social media users' privacy concerns?
2. How do users currently manage privacy on social media?
3. What factors influence users' current behaviors on social media?

**2.1 Social Media and Privacy Breaches**
With the rise of social media, companies have found new ways to monetize user data, often at the expense of privacy [25]. Methods include allowing third-party app access to user information and massive data collection by the platforms themselves [20, 30, 71]. Facebook has faced significant scrutiny over major data breaches, such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, which led to testimonies by Facebook executives before the U.S. Congress [62]. Despite this, many calls for improved data handling remain unaddressed. For example, a New York Times exposé in December 2018 revealed that Facebook had given major companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Spotify access to private messages [17]. Google+ also faced a massive security flaw, exposing the data of over 52 million users [45]. These events highlight the power of technology conglomerates and the lack of focus on protecting end users.

**2.2 Facebook and Privacy Studies**
Despite frequent news about digital privacy breaches and increasing data protection laws [26], users in developed countries often do not take many measures to protect their data. They continue to post personal information, despite claiming to be aware of privacy issues [19, 65]. Some strategies, such as self-censorship and information control, are used to manage privacy [14, 15]. Studies have also examined how users perceive data collection and privacy from third-party apps on Facebook [35, 72]. Most of these studies have been conducted in developed countries like the United States and Canada, and often only with student populations [9, 31, 37, 61, 73, 79]. This literature may not be representative of users in developing countries who face high data costs and engage in phone sharing [4, 40, 53].

**2.2.1 Social Media Use and Non-Use**
Studies in less-resourced settings, such as Bangladesh and Havana, have shown that users consume more content than they post on social media [11, 21]. Other studies in India and South Asia have focused on privacy attitudes and online abuse without specific attention to privacy management [36, 56, 57, 70]. For instance, Miller's year-long study in Trinidad [43] and Wyche et al.'s studies in Nairobi, Kenya, [77, 78, 75] provide insights into social media use for income generation and the challenges faced by low-income users.

**2.2.2 Privacy and Social Media in Marginalized Communities**
Some studies have explored privacy behaviors in non-African countries. For example, a study of Saudi Arabian WhatsApp users found that over half used privacy settings to hide their "Last Seen" status [51]. Another study in the Arab Gulf found that users often had private Facebook accounts or used post-level privacy settings to avoid dishonoring their families [3]. These studies highlight privacy behaviors in marginalized communities but may not fully apply to the South African context.

A closely related study examined South African college students' awareness of online privacy legislation [47]. Nyoni and Velempini found that 86% of respondents were unaware of privacy settings and 81% were unaware of their rights under South African law [46]. This study, however, focused only on Facebook and participants from a single university. Our study, in contrast, gathered data from a diverse participant pool across a city and examined multiple Facebook-related applications.

**3. Study Method and Participants**
To answer our research questions, the first author and a local research assistant conducted 52 in-person interviews with mobile social media users in Cape Town, South Africa, between November 2018 and February 2019. The study was approved by Princeton’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).

**3.1 South African Research Context**
South Africa has approximately 18 million social media users, 89% of whom browse exclusively from mobile devices [59]. Data costs are extremely expensive, and many low-income users rely on prepaid plans, using a large portion of their income on internet access. As a result, many users turn to zero-rated versions of applications to reduce costs.
