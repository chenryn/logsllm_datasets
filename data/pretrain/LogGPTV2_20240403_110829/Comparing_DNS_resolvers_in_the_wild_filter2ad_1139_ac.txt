### Optimizing DNS Response Times for Enhanced End-User Experience

For an optimal end-user experience, fast DNS (Domain Name System) response times are crucial. While this aspect has been previously explored in Section 4.1, we now delve into the specific IP addresses returned by DNS queries. Often, there are multiple options available for content retrieval, which can be attributed to load balancing and content distribution networks (CDNs) [9, 15]. CDNs replicate content and distribute it geographically to optimize network performance [12]. This section aims to investigate the diversity of resolved DNS names (i.e., IP addresses) across different vantage points and DNS resolvers, with a particular focus on potential interferences between the choice of DNS resolver and CDN measurements.

#### Resolved IP Addresses and CDN Optimization

As expected, our experiments reveal significant diversity in the IP addresses returned by DNS. We performed DNS queries for 10,000 unique hostnames, resulting in 36,000 unique resolved IP addresses. This diversity is partly due to the fact that we conducted two DNS queries for each hostname and repeated this process using three different DNS resolvers. The variation in resolved IP addresses can be attributed to load balancing and CDN content. When queries are repeated or when different DNS resolvers are used, the resolved IP addresses may differ based on the mechanisms employed by CDNs to optimize network performance for clients.

In Section 4.1, we found that local DNS resolvers generally provide lower latencies due to their proximity to end-hosts. This suggests that local DNS resolvers better represent the location of end-hosts compared to other resolvers. For performance and economic reasons, it might be preferable for CDNs to use a DNS resolver located within the local ISP of the end-host. Figure 5 illustrates, for each vantage point (x-axis), how many IP addresses belonging to the same ISP as the vantage point were returned by each DNS resolver across all queried content.

#### Analysis of DNS Resolver Performance

Our analysis shows that the majority of DNS answers point to content outside the vantage point’s network. GoogleDNS and OpenDNS, in particular, return IP addresses from different networks for all our traces. This is likely because these resolvers are not typically located within the ISP. However, for approximately 30 vantage points, we observed that content was downloaded from at least 100 hosts within the ISP’s network when the local DNS resolver was queried. In some cases, up to 926 out of our 10,000 hostnames were accessed locally.

This local access is significant, especially considering that it covers the entire set of Akamai content (see Section 3). We harvested IP addresses of Akamai servers by sending DNS queries to Akamai content from different Planetlab servers. Our manual inspection revealed that vantage points with local content generally have an Akamai server deployed within the same network.

#### Comparative Analysis of DNS Resolvers

Figure 5 indicates that only local DNS resolvers direct end-users to content that is locally available within the vantage point's network. To further analyze this, we compared the results of our three DNS resolvers pairwise, counting how often the results differed in terms of subnet, autonomous system (AS), and country. Figure 6 presents, for each vantage point (x-axis), the number of differences between the local DNS resolver and GoogleDNS.

Figure 6 reveals that the DNS answers differ in terms of subnets for approximately 2,000 out of our 10,000 hostnames. In half of these cases, the returned IP addresses belong to different ASs and countries. Given that the local DNS resolver points to content inside the ISP’s network for a significant number of hostnames (as shown in Figure 5), we conclude that GoogleDNS and OpenDNS unnecessarily direct end-users to content servers in different ASs or subnets. Due to space limitations, we do not present the plots for the comparisons between Local vs. OpenDNS and Google vs. OpenDNS, but they are similar to Figure 5. This observation supports recent IETF activities aimed at standardizing a way to include the IP address of the original end-host in DNS requests [5].

### Conclusion

Based on active measurements from more than 50 commercial ISPs, we have studied DNS performance by comparing the ISPs’ DNS deployment against widely used third-party DNS resolvers, such as GoogleDNS and OpenDNS. Typically, end-hosts experience very small latencies to the resolvers maintained by the local ISP, though there are cases where GoogleDNS and OpenDNS outperform the local DNS resolvers in terms of response times. Additionally, our findings suggest that several ISPs and OpenDNS rely on a load balancing setup without a shared cache, leading to poor caching efficiency. Even Google Public DNS, despite its claims [2], exhibits the same behavior for a few vantage points. Furthermore, third-party DNS resolvers do not effectively redirect users to content available within the ISP, unlike local DNS resolvers. This observation holds for all Akamai content.

Given the increasing share of CDN traffic [11, 13], future work will aim to fully understand the impact of DNS resolver choice on the performance optimizations made by CDNs. We plan to rerun our experiments with an enlarged set of vantage points and an enhanced version of our script to scrutinize caching and the role of anycast in DNS performance.
