Abstract—Modern hospital systems are complex environments
that rely on high interconnectivity with the larger Internet.
With this connectivity comes a vast attack surface. Security
researchers have expended considerable effort to characterize
the risks posed to medical devices (e.g., pacemakers and insulin
pumps). However, there has been no systematic, ecosystem-wide
analyses of a modern hospital system to date, perhaps due to
the challenges of collecting and analyzing sensitive healthcare
data. Hospital trafﬁc requires special considerations because
healthcare data may contain private information or may come
from safety-critical devices in charge of patient care. We describe
the process of obtaining the network data in a safe and ethical
manner in order to help expand future research in this ﬁeld. We
present an analysis of network-enabled devices connected to the
hospital used for its daily operations without posing any harm
to the hospital’s environment. We perform a Digital Healthcare-
Associated Infection (D-HAI) analysis of the hospital ecosystem,
assessing a major multi-campus healthcare system over a period
of six months. As part of the D-HAI analysis, we characterize DNS
requests and TLS/SSL communications to better understand the
threats faced within the hospital environment without disturbing
the operational network. Contrary to past assumptions, we ﬁnd
that medical devices have minimal exposure to the external
Internet, but that medical support devices (e.g., servers, computer
terminals) essential for daily hospital operations are much more
exposed. While much of this communication appears to be benign,
we discover evidence of insecure and broken cryptography and
misconﬁgured devices, and potential botnet activity. Analyzing the
network ecosystem in which they operate gives us an insight into
the weaknesses and misconﬁgurations hospitals need to address
to ensure the safety and privacy of patients.

INTRODUCTION
Modern medical systems are digital, networked, and com-
plex. From operations and ﬁnance to clinical departments,
virtually every facet of a contemporary healthcare organization
relies on interconnectivity with the wider Internet. Such con-
nections bring with them signiﬁcant beneﬁts, from the ability
to access patient records wherever they are needed to being
able to incorporate revolutionary treatments as they become
available. These systems hold the potential to improve quality
of care while reducing patient costs and unnecessary therapies.
Much of this rise in connectivity can be attributed to

the building of medical applications atop commercial off-
the-shelf (COTS) systems and networks. As such, healthcare
organizations have been able to rely upon much of the same
expertise used in other industries to reap the advantages of
“smart” devices and fast networks. This modernization has
been rapid and has fundamentally transformed the way that
healthcare is delivered in the developed world. However,
connection to the larger Internet has come with notable risks.
Like other systems relying on COTS components, hospital
systems also inherit a large number of publicly disclosed and
zero-day vulnerabilities [16], [22], [17]. Malware designed to
send spam [33] and encrypt critical ﬁles for ransom [32] have
already been found on machines within hospital networks,
taking advantage of unpatched operating systems and weak
security practices. Even devices long considered immune to
compromise by nature of their isolation from other systems
such as pacemakers and insulin pumps now allow remotely
controlled malicious behavior [20], [28], [29]. All of these
problems are ampliﬁed by unclear standards, resulting in the
device manufacturers failure to ﬁx vulnerable software for fear
of requiring FDA safety reviews [24].
There is no doubt that medical systems have vulnerabilities.
However, these individual examples and anecdotes fail to paint
a broad picture of the current state of affairs because we lack
a systematic, ecosystem-wide analysis of a modern healthcare
system.
In medicine, Healthcare-Associated Infection (HAI) refers
to the possible infections a patient may receive as part of
the treatment they need while in a hospital. Our case study
follows a similar goal but focuses on Digital Healthcare-
Associated Infection (D-HAI). D-HAI can be described as
either the characterization of health-related day-to-day trafﬁc
from network-enabled devices that are connected to the hospi-
tal network or the exposure to potential malware infection in
their daily operational use. As the ﬁrst such study, we focus on
characterizing the hospital network trafﬁc to assess its security
as a whole rather than looking for speciﬁc signs of device
infection. Critically, such an analysis must be done without
posing any potential harm to the hospital environment as it
operates. We make the ﬁrst such characterization in this paper,
and in so doing make the following contributions:
• Assess a Digital Hospital Ecosystem: We perform
the ﬁrst Digital Healthcare-Associated Infection (D-HAI)
analysis on a major, multi-campus healthcare system. Our
analysis captures trafﬁc from across this system from
January-July, 2018.
• Provide Guidelines for Ethical Research: We explain
our process and limitations of obtaining data from the
hospital network in order to facilitate future academic
research in studying this ﬁeld in an ethical manner.
• Categorize and Evaluate Outgoing Trafﬁc Requests:
We collect and evaluate over 775 million DNS requests
made from the hospital network. We show that traditional
whitelisting and blacklisting efforts used to analyze the
Internet do not cover a signiﬁcant amount of trafﬁc found
in a hospital ecosystem. Additionally, while the majority
of trafﬁc appears to be benign, there are indications of
malicious trafﬁc within the network (e.g., potential botnet
activity).
• Characterize Security of Encrypted Communications:
We measure and evaluate the state of TLS/SSL communi-
cations based on our collection of 325 million handshakes
across the hospital network. While we observe many
positive trends (e.g., lower use of vulnerable versions
of TLS/SSL compared to the larger Internet), we also
record signiﬁcant use of broken/deprecated cryptographic
primitives and handshake modes, and some evidence of
misconﬁgured devices.
While there are similar studies to this paper of various
enterprises, no prior study has been done in a hospital network.
The sensitive nature of this environment requires special care
to ensure that our study is both ethical and safe to perform. As
a case study, we discuss the two year process to bring together
all of the necessary stakeholders to ensure that our study never
threatened patient privacy or safety. While this process posed
limitations and delayed our ability to conduct our study, we
believe that it was an absolutely critical component of our
efforts. We hope that other researchers will be able to follow
a similar process in order to conduct an ethical and safe
investigation in critically-sensitive environments.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion II gives a background on the network protocols studied
and a topology of a hospital; Section III details the processes
we undertook to ensure an ethical and safe study; Section IV
explains our methodology and outlines the datasets; Section V
shows our analysis of connection requests made by medical
devices; Section VI focuses on the communication channel
of medical devices; Section VII discusses our limitations
and future work; Section VIII highlights related work; and
Section IX offers concluding remarks.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Hospital Networks
To provide timely patient care on a daily basis, hospitals
rely on the availability and the infrastructure of their network.
A hospital’s network poses many unique challenges that other
commercial networks may not. A major problem is that many
devices throughout the network (mobile or stationary) need
to have broad access to patient data at any given moment.
Each device is thus a potential attack vector as even one
infection could result
in unauthorized access to thousands
of personal records. Such leakage of data is not limited to
just ﬁnancial and personally identiﬁable information, but also
health and diagnostic information not found elsewhere. While
network-wide issues (e.g., DDoS attacks or outages) might
create downtime and monetary losses to commercial-driven
networks, such issues can potentially be life-threatening in a
hospital setting. During such events a device used for patient
care or the diagnostic information of a patient could become
inaccessible.
Devices within the network include MRI machines, med-
ical beds, surgical robots, and many other IP enabled med-
ical devices. These critical devices must follow regulatory
guidelines including FDA approval [24] and HIPAA compli-
ance [30]. In addition to those unique devices only found in a
hospital, other devices such as printers, accounting computers,
and doctor’s laptops make up a large portion of the network.
B. Network Protocols
Our study involves trafﬁc from two networking protocols:
DNS and SSL/TLS. We chose DNS because it allows us to
see the domains being visited by devices within the network
without revealing additional information that may compromise
the privacy of those connections. SSL/TLS were chosen for
this study because they are the most widely deployed security
protocols.
(e.g., www.domain.com)
The Domain Name System (DNS) maps human-readable
domain names
to machine-
readable IP addresses (e.g., 1.2.3.4) among a range of data
types. DNS is separated into organizationally-controlled zones
that are arranged in a hierarchical structure, with each zone
having information about itself and links to the sub-domains
beneath it [39]. Zones in DNS are named based on their
position within the hierarchical structure: www.domain.com
would have a top level domain (TLD) of .com, and second
level domain (2LD) of .domain, etc. On occasion,
the
effective second level domain (e2LD) is used to signal the
canonical name of the domain (e.g., google.co.uk) since
registration is only allowed at the third level and below.
The response of a DNS request is sent via resource records
(RR). Passive DNS records can indicate that a device inside
a network has attempted to resolve the address of a known
malicious domain. While the request alone does not imply
that the device is necessarily compromised or malicious, it
may warrant investigation of the device itself [11].
Once DNS provides a method for devices to ﬁnd each
other on the Internet, the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol
and its modern successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
protocol, provide a cryptographically secure communication
channel between them. To establish a secure connection with a
server using SSL/TLS, a client must ﬁrst validate the identity
of the server it is communicating with.1 To do so, a server
presents the client with an X.509 certiﬁcate containing the
server’s identity and signature. Certiﬁcates are issued by one
of a number of Certiﬁcate Authorities (CAs) that assert the
server’s identity. It is up to the client to track which CAs it
deems trustworthy; if the CA that issued the server’s certiﬁcate
is trusted by the client, then the client validates the X.509
certiﬁcate and begins secure communication with the server.
Many versions of both protocols have been deprecated and
deemed insecure for various reasons, ranging from susceptibil-

identity.

ity to downgrade attacks to the use of insecure cryptography.
At the time of writing, the current acceptable protocol standard
in use is TLS 1.2; however, early implementations of TLS 1.3
are already being deployed [27].
III. DESIGNING AND EXECUTING AN ETHICAL STUDY
Designing this study required legal, institutional, regula-
tory, and self-imposed limitations to protect the safety and
privacy of the hospital. There have been multiple papers
published in the security community over the last decade that
have caused signiﬁcant discussions about ethics. While these
papers are often cleared by the university’s Institutional Review
Boards (IRBs), the implications of the work are often not clear
to these approval boards. The resulting papers clearly push the
boundary of community norms and are published “asking for
forgiveness instead of permission.”
Such a cavalier approach is not possible in our setting.
In addition to the potential to violate patient privacy and run
afoul of the law (e.g., HIPAA in the United States), studies of
medical ecosystems must also ensure that they do not interfere
with patient care or safety, nor the anonymity of the hospital
workers. Accordingly, we must make sure that our study by
design minimizes any potential for such a negative impact.
Achieving these ends has taken over two years of planning
and effort. Prior to presenting a detailed study to our IRB,
we met with legal counsel for both our university and the
hospital system. We then worked in conjunction with IT staff
from both organizations to determine the feasibility of any
requested analysis and its potential impact. We also provided
such information to our funding agency.
A. Design Process and Limitations
Agreeing to the details of our study required multiple
rounds of discussion with stakeholders. In particular, the legal
team and hospital IT staff requested more speciﬁcity from our
original proposal regarding the following issues:
