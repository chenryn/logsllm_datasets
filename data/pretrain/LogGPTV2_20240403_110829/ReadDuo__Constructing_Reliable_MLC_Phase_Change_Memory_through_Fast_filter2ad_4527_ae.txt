Figure 10 reports the dynamic energy consumption under
different schemes. We normalized the results to Ideal.
Due to frequent scrubbing, Scrubbing consumes 17%
more energy than Ideal with W=1 setting. M-metric
consume 5% extra dynamic energy due to long read latency.
The scrubbing energy consumption is small because the
frequency to issue a scrub operation is lower. Hybrid
adopts W=0 scrubbing, meaning that more scrub operations
has to be issued. Therefore, the extra energy overhead is
8.7%.
Our proposed LWT-4 reduces energy consumption for
some benchmarks, like bwaves, bzip2, etc. The reduction
comes from two parts, one is because the read latency is
now shortened compared with M-metric. Also, by using
W=1 scrubbing mode, our scrubbing energy is also saved
compared with Hybrid. However, it is noticeable that for
some benchmarks, such as sphinx, the energy consumption is
increased signiﬁcantly. This is because for such benchmarks,
we convert many R-M read to write operations, thus the
energy consumption is higher. Overall, LWT-4 has an
energy overhead of 1.33%.
The Select-4:2 reduces the write energy signiﬁcantly,
which contributes the major part of the overall dynamic
energy. Since we only need to modify changed bits, the
energy is only 77.8% of the Ideal, which writes all line
with full writes.
C. Energy Delay Area Product
We next examined different schemes by taking subarray
area into consideration. We start with comparison of the
effective cell array sizes when storing same amount of
information. Take 64B data as example, the TLC design
with (72,64) SECDED code requires 192 tri-level cells to
store data. Scrubbing with BCH-8 and parity check per
32bits, resulting to use 155 cells to store data. Our proposed
schemes, also requires BCH-8 attached per line. With LWT-
4, another 153 cells per line is required, thus storing 64B
212
requires cells. We normalize all the required cells to store a
line to TLC and show the result in Figure 11.
To evaluate the schemes on performance, energy con-
sumption, and area, we used EDAP (Energy Delay Area
product) metric and reported the comparison results in
Figure 11. In this ﬁgure, lower bars mean better results.
Product-D and Product-S are the results when consid-
ering dynamic energy and system energy, respectively. When
considering dynamic energy only, on average, LWT-4 and
Select-4:2 achieves 7.5% and 37% over TLC.
When considering system energy, they achieves 11% and
23% over TLC design.

D. Sensitivity Study
In this section, we varied the choices of parameters and
evaluated their impacts on the system.
1) Impact of Subinterval Number(k): The value of k
determines how many subintervals we have in one 640s
scrubbing interval. With bigger k, we are able to track longer
time. Longer tracking time will give some benchmarks
higher opportunity to enable fast R-read. At the same time,
we need to add more ﬂag bits to enable ﬁner granularity
tracking. We report several benchmarks that shows signiﬁ-
cantly better performance with more subintervals. Figure 12
shows that the performance improvement from k =2 to k =4
is 0.7% for all benchmarks, and 2.3% for memory intensive
benchmark mcf.

2) Impact of Select Rewrite Interval Number(s): As stated
in Section III-D, the choice of s determines how frequently
we can convert a full write to a selective write. We compare
Select-4:1 and Select-4:2 two settings and compare the
energy reduction results. Figure 13 shows that the energy
saving for s =2 over s =1 is 1.2%.

3) R-M-read conversion in LWT-k: Figure 14 shows the
beneﬁt of R-M read conversion enhancement in LWT-4.
For several benchmarks, for example, sphinx, enabling R-
M Read conversion will bring much better performance.
The performance improvement for sphinx by enabling R-
M Read conversion is 22%. Meanwhile, as we analyze
in Section V-B, the energy consumption is also increased
because of the conversion. Overall, R-M-read conversion
with LWT-4 will gain 2.9% improvement on performance.

E. Lifetime Impact
For PCM, the memory lifetime is determined by numbers
of write operations. We examine different schemes impact
on memory lifetime and show the result
in Figure 15.
Scrubbing will shorten 12.4% lifetime. M-metric with
W=1 scrubbing will have negligible lifetime impact on
memory. Hybrid, LWT-4 will reduce lifetime by 6% and
10%. By enabling the Select-4:2, the memory lifetime
is increased by 42%.

VI. RELATED WORK
Phase Change memory is one of promising non-volatile
memory technologies for future memory systems. In ad-
dition to resistance drift, many issues have been stud-
ied in the literature. ECP [27], PAYG [17], Free-p [33],
Safer [25] focus on hard errors in PCM. Write disturbance
was addressed in SD-PCM [30] and DIN [10]. Wear-leveling
techniques were proposed in Security-refresh [24] and Start-
gap [19]. MLC PCM also suffers from long write latency and
leading performance degradation. Write cancellation [18],
write truncation[11] addressed the long write latency in
MLC PCM.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we propose ReadDuo, a resistance drift
resilient readout solution for MLC PCM system. ReadDuo
combines fast R-metric sensing and drift resilient M-metric
sensing. It converts the reliability design to a performance
optimization problem. By selectively scrubbing MLC lines
for drift errors and selectively rewriting drifted cells only,
ReadDuo achieves high performance, low energy consump-
tion, and good storage density simultaneously.
