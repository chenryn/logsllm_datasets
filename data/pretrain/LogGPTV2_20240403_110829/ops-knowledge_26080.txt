Question: "You are tasked with enhancing the security of a mobile application that handles sensitive user data. The stakeholders emphasize the importance of ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Which of the following sets of cryptographic algorithms and practices should you recommend for the application to align with modern security standards and best practices?"
 "A": "Use DES for encryption due to its long-standing reputation, MD5 for hashing to ensure data integrity, and RSA with 2048-bit keys for digital signatures."
 "B": "Implement AES-GCM-256 for confidentiality, SHA-256 for integrity, and ECDSA with NIST P-384 for digital signatures."
 "C": "Opt for RC4 for stream encryption as it is lightweight, SHA1 for hashing due to its speed, and Dual_EC_DRBG for random number generation."
 "D": "Choose 3DES for block encryption to leverage its triple encryption feature, BLOWFISH for hashing operations, and RSA with 1024-bit keys for key establishment."
Answer: B
