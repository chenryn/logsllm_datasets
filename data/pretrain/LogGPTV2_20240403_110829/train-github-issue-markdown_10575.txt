##### Issue Type:
Feature Idea
##### Component Name:
core
##### Ansible Version:
$ ansible --version  
ansible 2.0.0.2  
config file = /home/damjan/sys-ops/ansible.cfg  
configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### Ansible Configuration:
    ask_vault_pass   =  true
    become           = true
##### Summary:
the ansible.cfg file has `become=true` and `ask_vault_pass=true` but in rare
situations I need to run `ansible` without the vault or sudo requirements. It
would need to have something like `--no-become` and `--no-ask-vault-pass` or
`--become=false` to be able to revert the defaults from the config file.
