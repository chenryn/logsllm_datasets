How can this common `Windows 7` error be fixed? I'm using the Java bindings
and I'm about to go nuts since I tried everything and nothing worked:
  1. Running the system file checker `sfc /scannow` (no violations found)
  2. Searching for each DLL in the Windows search (all DLLs are found)
  3. Repairing the system image `Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth` (does not work on `Windows 7`)
  4. Downloading `OpenCV` and extract the `DLL`s to the Java application's root folder (does not fix the issue)
  5. Installing the `DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer` (does not fix the issue)
  6. Rebooting after all previous mentioned points (does not fix the issue)
This is a related `StackOverflow` question with additional information.
Thank you.
