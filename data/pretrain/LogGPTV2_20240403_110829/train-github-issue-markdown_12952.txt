I have defined the following request mapping:  
`@RequestMapping`(value = "/services/{serviceKey}/vos", method =
RequestMethod.GET)
There is a problem if the value of {serviceKey} contains a "/", for example if
{serviceKey}=http://example.com/foo  
This makes sense of course since the requestmapping cannot easily know that
the / is part of a PathVariable.
However, I would have assumed that if the URL is URL-encoded as
"http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Ffoo" this should not be a problem. But apparently
this values for some reason cannot mapped properly because it reports:
"org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet - DispatcherServlet with
name 'dispatcher' processing GET request for
[/core/services/http://example.com/foo/vos]"
If the already URL-encoded values is URL-encoded again to
"http%253A%252F%252Fexample.com%252Ffoo", the mapping works:
"org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet - DispatcherServlet with
name 'dispatcher' processing GET request for
[/core/services/http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Ffoo/vos]"
So, my question is whether there is a way how to make Spring accept the URL
encoded value "http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Ffoo" as PathVariable or whether this
is a bug.
I tested this on Tomcat 6 and Jetty 7.
