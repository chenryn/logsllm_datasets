User: I have a scheduled task which runs a python script every 10 min
so it turns out that a script pops up on my desktop every 10 min
how can i make it invincible so my script will work in the background ?
I've been told that pythonw will do the work, but I cant figure out how to use it
any help ?
thanks
Assistant: Set the scheduled task to start the script as minimized.
