User: where should my python files be stored so that I can run that using gdb. I have custom gdb located at /usr/local/myproject/bin. I start my gdb session by calling ./arm-none-eabi-gdb from the above location.
I don't know how this gdb and python are integrated into each other.
Can anyone help.?
Assistant: I was able to figure out. What I understood is
GDB embeds the Python interpreter so it can use Python as an extension language.
You can't just import gdb from /usr/bin/python like it's an ordinary Python library because GDB isn't structured as a library.
What you can do is source MY-SCRIPT.py from within gdb (equivalent to running gdb -x MY-SCRIPT.py).
