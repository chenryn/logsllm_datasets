ABSTRACT
Large-scale abusive advertising is a proﬁt-driven endeavor. Without
consumers purchasing spam-advertised Viagra, search-advertised
counterfeit software or malware-advertised fake anti-virus, these
campaigns could not be economically justiﬁed. Thus, in addition
to the numerous efforts focused on identifying and blocking indi-
vidual abusive advertising mechanisms, a parallel research direc-
tion has emerged focused on undermining the associated means
of monetization: payment networks. In this paper we explain the
complex role of payment processing in monetizing the modern af-
ﬁliate program ecosystem and characterize the dynamics of these
banking relationships over two years within the counterfeit phar-
maceutical and software sectors. By opportunistically combining
our own active purchasing data with contemporary disruption ef-
forts by brand-holders and payment card networks, we gather the
ﬁrst empirical dataset concerning this approach. We discuss how
well such payment interventions work, how abusive merchants re-
spond in kind and the role that the payments ecosystem is likely to
play in the future.

individual mechanisms directly, an alternative research agenda re-
volves around undermining the economics of the activity itself. In
particular, as with all advertisers, the actors employing these abu-
sive techniques are proﬁt-seeking and only participate due to the
promise of compensation (e.g., a typical pharmaceutical spammer
is paid a 40% commission on the gross revenue of each sale they
bring in). Thus, if these payments dried up, so too might the incen-
tive to continue advertising.
In this paper we examine this question by focusing particularly
on abusive advertising that is directly capitalized through consumer
credit card payments (e.g., counterfeit goods such as pharmaceuti-
cals [11] and some fraud scams such as fake anti-virus [15]). We are
motivated in part by our previous work documenting that a small
number of banks are implicated in handling credit card payments
for the vast majority of spam-advertised goods [10]. In that pa-
per, we hypothesized that interrupting those banking relationships
might be an effective intervention for undermining such activity.
However, at the time we lacked the data to evaluate this “payment
intervention” theory; to the best of our knowledge, few such con-
certed actions were even being attempted. Over the last year, how-
ever, there has been signiﬁcant adoption of this approach and we
are now in a position to examine this question empirically.
Thus, in this paper, we advance our understanding of the role
played by merchant banking and provide some of the ﬁrst evidence
about the efﬁcacy of payment intervention. Our work makes three
contributions in this vein:
• Payment mechanics. We explain the role of the existing con-
sumer payment ecosystem in the monetization of abusive ad-
vertising by afﬁliate programs, the details of which are both
critical and unfamiliar to much of the security community.
• Account dynamics. We empirically measure and characterize
the relationship of 40 sponsoring afﬁliate programs with the
banks and merchant accounts they use to monetize customer
trafﬁc and the role of such banks in this ecosystem over two
years.
• Bank intervention. We opportunistically measure the impact
of targeted efforts to terminate a subset of these merchant
accounts and characterize the emerging structure of this con-
ﬂict.
Overall, we ﬁnd that reliable merchant banking is a scarce and crit-
ical resource that, when targeted carefully, is highly fragile to dis-
ruption. As a testament to this ﬁnding, we document the decima-
tion of online credit-card ﬁnanced counterfeit software sales due to
845a focused eradication effort. We further document how less care-
fully executed interventions, in the pharmaceutical sector, can also
have serious (although less dramatic) impacts, including program
closures, pursuit of riskier payment mechanisms, and reduced or-
der conversions. Finally, we document the set of countermeasures
being employed now by surviving merchants and discuss the result-
ing operational requirements for using payment intervention as an
effective tool.
2. BACKGROUND
In this section we explain both the business structure of modern
abuse-advertised goods as well as the structure of the payment card
ecosystem and how the two integrate in practice.
2.1 Afﬁliate marketing
Since at least 2005, abuse-advertised goods and services have
been dominated by a business model comprised of independent
advertisers acting as free agents paid on a commission basis by
the sponsors they shill for. This arrangement, frequently called the
“afﬁliate program” model (or sometimes “partnerka”), has been
highly successful—allowing botnet operators to focus on acquir-
ing trafﬁc (e.g., via spam or search), while sponsors handle the
“back end” including software, fulﬁllment, customer service and
payment processing. This relationship is well documented in the
work of Samosseiko [14], Levchenko et al. [10], Stone-Gross et
al. [15, 16], Kanich et al. [6], Leontiadis et al. [9] and McCoy et
al. [11] among others.
Mechanically, the relationship works as follows: individual afﬁl-
iates attempt to drive trafﬁc to particular Web sites (e.g., through e-
mail spam, search engine optimization, social network abuse, mal-
ware installed on the host, etc.). In some cases the domain names
and Web sites are held and hosted by the afﬁliate program, but in
other situations they are managed by the afﬁliate. Users who visit
this site are greeted with a storefront typically designed by the af-
ﬁliate program that provides a selection of products and a standard
shopping cart interface (most afﬁliate programs provide a broad
range of “templates” targeted towards different markets). If a cus-
tomer selects products for purchase and then clicks on the “check-
out” button, they are diverted to a “billing page” where they are
asked to provide their name, address and payment credentials.
There are two kinds of billing pages provided in the industry:
on-site and off-site. On-site billing pages are organically integrated
in the Web site the customer visited, while offsite billing involves
redirection to a different Web site (typically with domain names
like “secure-billing.com”). In both cases however it is this external
site, operated by the afﬁliate program, that accepts the billing in-
formation (the onsite billing “veneer” is typically implemented as
an RPC-like protocol using PHP and forms). Thus, it is this point
of accepting the billing information where the relationship with the
customer is handed from the advertising afﬁliate to the sponsoring
afﬁliate program.1 Ultimately, it is the primary responsibility of the
program to convert the latent demand attracted by its afﬁliate ad-
vertisers into concrete purchases; obtaining money from trafﬁc.
2.2 Payment cards
In the retail environment purchases can be settled using cash,
but online purchase transactions are typically executed via payment
card networks such as provided by Visa, MasterCard and American
1Should the customer complete a sale the afﬁliate who delivered
that customer is eventually paid a commission (typically 40% of
gross revenue for pharmaceuticals, and a bit more for counterfeit
software or fake anti-virus) via some separate payment mechanism
(e.g., WebMoney or Liberty Reserve).
Express. In one recent empirical study covering several years of
transactions for a large online pharmacy, McCoy et al. [11] found
that over 95% of all revenue was delivered via such networks.2
Thus, managing and maintaining reliable access to such pay-
ments is critical to all such business and ultimately provides the
money (paid on a commission basis) that funds the creation of spam
and SEO-focused botnets. In the remainder of this section, we pro-
vide an overview of how modern payment networks operate and, in
particular, how they interact with online merchants such as those in
our study.
The basic transaction
While a wide variety of payment card systems exists, we focus on
Visa and MasterCard because they have by far the largest consumer
footprint and ultimately are the networks by which all but a small
fraction of abuse-driven advertising is monetized.
Visa and MasterCard are so-called “open loop” systems, because
they implement multi-party payment networks that interconnect a
range of distinct member banks. In particular, there are at least ﬁve
parties in every such transaction: the cardholder, issuing bank, card
association, acquiring bank, and merchant. The cardholder is the
individual making a purchase who obtains a payment card (e.g.,
credit, debit, prepaid, etc.) via an issuing bank. The card number is
structured into two key ﬁelds: a six-digit Bank Identiﬁcation Num-
ber (BIN) that identiﬁes the issuing bank of record and, typically,
a 10-digit Primary Account Number (PAN) that identiﬁes the card-
holder’s account (credit or debit) held by that bank.
To make a purchase, the cardholder provides their card number
and associated personal information to a merchant (e.g., via an In-
ternet form) and the merchant then passes this information, along
with the price of the service, to their acquiring bank. This bank,
sometimes also called the “merchant bank”, then uses the card as-
sociation network (e.g., VisaNet) to reach the issuer and requests an
“authorization” for the amount speciﬁed (frequently in real-time)
using a variant of the ISO 8583 protocol [4].
In considering whether to approve this transaction the issuer has
available a range of features including the BIN of the merchant
bank, the country of operation, the Merchant Category Code (MCC)
of the merchant terminal (e.g., MCC 5912 is used for pharmaceuti-
cals [18]), the size of the request, the amount of money available to
the cardholder and so on. As well, the merchant may elect to pay for
the Address Veriﬁcation Service (AVS) that veriﬁes if the street ad-
dress and ZIP provided by the customer match that registered with
the issuing bank.3 If the authorization request is approved, then the
money (or credit) is held at the issuer, the acquiring bank is noti-
ﬁed (again via the card association network) and the acquiring bank
informs the merchant that the purchase request is approved. On a
longer time basis (e.g., 24 hours) a batch settlement transaction is
used to make this request concrete and money is transferred from
the cardholder’s issuing bank to the merchant’s acquiring bank.4
Note that authorization does not imply settlement and the merchant
is free to not complete the transaction (in which case the hold on
2A smaller number of transactions are completed using so-called
“alternative payment” systems such as PayPal, as well as other
money transfer vehicles such as Western Union or the ACH Net-
work (i.e., eChecks), but these are a small part of consumer pay-
ments in Western countries.
3AVS is typically a bundled service implemented as part of autho-
rization. However, it is possible to separate AVS from authorization
and verify address data before issuing an authorization request.
4In some cases it is possible for the merchant to use a different
BIN for authorization and settlement, but typically only when these
belong to the same bank.

available again to the cardholder).
In practice, however, there can be quite a bit more complexity
than described above. In particular, while the issuing and acquir-
ing banks are ultimately responsible for the transactions made in
their name, they will frequently outsource the actual “processing”
of transactions to a third party (e.g., First Data). Moreover, while
some banks will market accounts directly to merchants, in many
cases this is commonly performed by an Independent Sales Orga-
nization (ISO) who is sponsored by one or more acquiring banks
and may largely “own” the merchant relationship.5
High-risk accounts
In all cases, the acquiring bank still holds liability on any trans-
actions (e.g., due to chargebacks from unhappy consumers). Thus,
merchant accounts (whether direct or through an ISO) must be un-
derwritten by the bank against the merchant’s risk proﬁle (i.e., the
likelihood of fraud, ﬁne assessment and charge-backs).
Some businesses are considered inherently high-risk (e.g., on-
line pharmaceuticals, pornography, multi-level marketing, etc.) and
many banks may refuse to underwrite such businesses entirely. Those
that do will charge much higher transaction fees, and may demand
up-front money, transaction “holdbacks” and a documented history
of high turnover with low charge-back rates.
Another approach for such merchants (as well as for “startups”
without signiﬁcant processing history) is to use what is called “third-
party processing” or aggregation. For example, Visa provides a pro-
gram for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) who can contract with
an acquiring bank to provide payment services on behalf of mer-
chants contracted directly with the PSP. In principal, PSPs comply
with Visa rules, and thus they will only be able to aggregate high-
risk client transactions with acquiring banks who are agreeable.
However, a less benign form of aggregation, sometimes called
“factoring”, occurs when a merchant or ISO resells access to an ex-
isting merchant account with an acquiring bank and launders trans-
actions from multiple merchants through this account (clients who
may in fact be in a different line of business or risk category). In
extreme cases, a criminal ISO might register a slew of shell com-
panies with one or more banks (sometimes working directly with
