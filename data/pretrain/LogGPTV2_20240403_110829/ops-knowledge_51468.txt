I created a virtual environment for my project, but I am unable to activate it. The issue might be related to syntax or folder location, but I'm currently unsure of the solution.

Below are the steps I followed:

1. **Creating the Virtual Environment:**
   - I used the command `virtualenv --no-site-packages venv` to create the virtual environment.
   - The `--no-site-packages` flag is deprecated, as it is now the default behavior.
   - The new Python executable was created in `venv\Scripts\python.exe`.
   - Setuptools and pip were installed successfully.

   ```plaintext
   c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
   The --no-site-packages flag is deprecated; it is now the default behavior.
   Using real prefix 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python'
   New python executable in venv\Scripts\python.exe
   File venv\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg exists with different content; not overwriting
   Installing setuptools.................done.
   Installing pip...................done.
   ```

2. **Attempting to Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - I tried to activate the virtual environment using the command `source venv/bin/activate`, but it did not work.
   - The error message indicated that `source` is not recognized as an internal or external command.

   ```plaintext
   c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>source venv/bin/activate
   'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
   operable program or batch file.
   ```

3. **System Information:**
   - I am using Python 7 on Windows OS.
   - My virtualenv version is 2.2.x.

4. **Potential Solution:**
   - If the command `.\venv\Scripts\activate` does not work and you encounter the error:
     ```
     \Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
     ```
   - You can resolve this by opening PowerShell as an administrator and running the following command:
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
     ```

This should enable script execution and allow you to activate the virtual environment.
