### Description
#### Background
The new Dynamic Task Mapping feature adds the attribute `map_index` to the
`TaskInstance` class. When viewing information for a single mapped task
instance, you must select based on this `map_index`, e.g. an integer value
`0`, `1`, `2`, ... `n`.
However, task instances can be mapped based on an iterable data type using the
`.expand()` \- using a slightly modified Airflow Simple Mapping example, on a
list:
    added_values = add_one.expand(x=['truck', 'car', 'bicycle'])
It is a challenge to view the log for the task instance `add_one` that used
the input `'truck'`. In the UI, there is no indication of the element at that
index, only the index. In practice, you must click through **all** task
instances `[0, 1, 2]` to find the truck log.
#### Proposal
  * Parameter for `TaskInstance` that maps `map_index` to a value with meaning i.e. the list element at index `map_index`
  * UI updated to show list element, if parameter is provided
### Use case/motivation
I would like the UI to indicate the input element value for each mapped task
instance, not the index `map_index`. This will make it easier to navigate
mapped task instances.
