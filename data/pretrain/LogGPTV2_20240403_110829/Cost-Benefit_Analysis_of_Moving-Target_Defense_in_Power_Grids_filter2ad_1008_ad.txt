t(cid:48)) is increased,
where COPF,t(cid:48) is the OPF cost of the system corresponding to
the measurement matrix Ht(cid:48) computed using (1) (at time t(cid:48)),
and C(cid:48)
OPF,t(cid:48) is the OPF cost of the system with MTD (corre-
sponding to the measurement matrix H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)). Note that CMTD,t(cid:48)
is always non-negative since the additional perturbation due
to MTD will increase the OPF cost.
From (3), we note that CMTD,t(cid:48) depends on the separation
between the column spaces of Ht(cid:48) and H(cid:48)
t(cid:48). In particular, if
the two matrices are identical, then CMTD,t(cid:48) is zero. As the
separation between the column spaces of the two matrices
γ(Ht(cid:48), H(cid:48)
the power ﬂows within the two
systems and the corresponding generation dispatch will be
different (due to the reactance perturbation). Consequently, the
OPF cost in the system with MTD perturbation will increase.
t(cid:48)) closely approximates
γ(Ht(cid:48), H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)). Hence, MTD’s operational cost increases as we
choose perturbations with higher γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)). The approxi-
mation can be explained as follows. Recall that Ht and Ht(cid:48)
differ only due to temporal variations in the system load. Since
the power system load is temporally correlated, the matrices
Ht and Ht(cid:48) will not differ signiﬁcantly and their column
spaces are nearly aligned. Thus, γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) can be used as an
approximate measure of the SPA between the column spaces
of Ht(cid:48) and H(cid:48)
t(cid:48). Extensive simulation results driven by real-
world data load traces presented in Section VII conﬁrm the
validity of this approximation.
Our observation is that γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
MTD Tradeoff
Following the above arguments, we note that the defender
faces conﬂicting objectives. On the one hand, for the MTD to
be effective from an attack detection point of view, the column
spaces of the matrices Ht and H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) should be as orthogonal
as possible. On the other hand, the MTD’s operational cost
increases with γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)). Thus, there exists a trade-off be-
tween the MTD’s effectiveness and its operational cost. To
balance the two aspects, we formulate the MTD reactance
selection problem as a constrained optimization problem with
the objective of minimizing the operational cost subject to a
constraint on the MTD’s effectiveness. The problem is stated
as:

In (4), the SPA between the column spaces of Ht and H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)
is used as a heuristic metric to approximate the effectiveness
of the attack detection η(cid:48)(δ) (based on the conjecture stated
in Section V-C). In (4b), we impose a constraint on the
SPA, where γth ∈ [0, π/2] is a threshold that must be tuned
numerically (see Section VII for more details). Simulation
results show that different values of the threshold γth provide
a spectrum of trade-offs between the MTD’s effectiveness and
its operational cost. We propose to solve (4) numerically using
existing constrained non-linear optimization solvers (e.g., the
fmincon function of MATLAB).
Note that the attacker does not have sufﬁcient information
to solve (4) and thus cannot anticipate the MTD perturbations.
In particular, at time t(cid:48), the attacker does not know Ht, since
there is not sufﬁcient time to learn it given the frequency of
perturbations (see the discussion in Sec. IV-A). Hence, the
secrecy of the MTD is satisﬁed.
VII. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we present simulation results to evaluate the
MTD’s effectiveness and its operational cost.

We perform simulations using the IEEE 14-bus system. The
bus topology is shown in Fig. 5. We obtain its conﬁguration
data from the MATPOWER package [27]. As shown in Fig. 5,
the generators are installed at buses 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 and their
parameters are listed in Table IV. We use the linear generation
cost model given by Ci(Gi,t) = ciGi,t. We assume that
D-FACTS devices are installed on 6 branches indexed by

LD = {1, 5, 9, 11, 17, 19}. The D-FACTS limits are set to
xmin = (1− ηmax)x and xmin = (1 + ηmax)x, where x is the
default values (obtained from the IEEE 14-bus case ﬁle) and
ηmax is set to 0.5. Further, the branch ﬂow limits are chosen
to be 160 MWs for link 1, and 60 MWs for all other links of
the power system. The rest of the settings are obtained from
the MATPOWER conﬁguration case ﬁle.
B. Simulation Results with Static Load
In the ﬁrst set of simulations, we assume that the system
load is static (we use default values from the IEEE 14-bus
MATPOWER case ﬁle). The pre-perturbation reactances xt
(and Ht) are adjusted by solving (1). The defender designs
MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) assuming that the attacker has acquired the knowl-
edge of Ht, and that he injects attacks of the form a = Htc.
Effectiveness of Attack Detection: First, we examine the
MTD’s effectiveness (η(cid:48)(δ)) for different values of γ(H, H(cid:48)).
t(cid:48)) ∈ [0, 0.45] radians in steps of 0.05
We choose γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
radians. For each value of γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)), we solve the optimiza-
tion problem (4) by setting γth to the corresponding value,
and evaluate η(cid:48)(δ) using Monte Carlo simulations as follows.
We consider 1000 attack vectors of the form a = Htc,
where the vector c is chosen as a random vector drawn from
the Gaussian distribution, and scale its magnitude such that
||a||1/||z||1 ≈ 0.08 (the scaling adjusts the magnitude of
attack injections to be relatively small in comparison to the
actual measurements). We then evaluate P (cid:48)
D(a) for each of
the attack vectors (the details will be presented shortly), and
D(a) ≥ δ,
count the fraction of attack vectors for which P (cid:48)
for a given value of δ ∈ [0, 1]. For each attack vector, the
detection probability P (cid:48)
D(a) is computed by generating 1000

instantiations of measurement noise (according to the Gaussian
distribution), and counting the number of times the BDD alarm
is triggered. The BDD threshold is adjusted such that the FP
rate is set to 5 × 10−4. We note that MTD does not alter the
FP rate of the BDD.
In Fig. 6 (a), we plot the variation of η(cid:48)(δ) as a function
of γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) for different values of δ. In this ﬁgure, the y-
D(a) ≥ δ,
axis represents the fraction of attacks for which P (cid:48)
for a given γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)). We observe that η(cid:48)(δ) monotonically
increases with γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)), thus conﬁrming our intuition that
MTD perturbations with higher values of γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) are more
effective in attack detection. E.g., for γ = 0.44, 97% of the
attacks have a detection probability greater than 0.95. In prac-
tice, the defender can run these simulations to determine an
appropriate γth for meeting a desired level of attack detection.
Comparison With Existing Work: We also perform simu-
lations to compare our MTD selection approach with state
of the art [11], [12], [13]. Similar to the related work, we
implement MTD by selecting random MTD perturbations that
are constrained to be within 2% of the optimal value. We
plot η(cid:48)(δ) as a function of δ for ﬁve such randomly-chosen
perturbations in Fig. 7. It can be seen that η(cid:48)(δ) exhibits high
variability across the trials, implying that the randomly chosen
MTD perturbations cannot always guarantee effective attack
detection.
Further, out of 500 such randomly chosen perturbations
(known also as the keyspace [11], [12]), we count the fraction
of perturbations which satisfy η(cid:48)(δ) ≥ 0.9 for different
values of δ, and plot the results in Fig. 8. We observe that
less 10% of the randomly-selected MTD perturbations satisfy
η(cid:48)(0.9) ≥ 0.9. In contrast, the MTD perturbations chosen
according to our approach can always guarantee a certain
effectiveness, once the subspace angle threshold γth is adjusted
to an appropriate value. This highlights the importance of
designing the MTD according to the formal design criterion
advanced in this work.
To show the scalability of the proposed approach to larger
bus systems, we plot the η(cid:48)(δ) as a function of γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) for
the IEEE 30-bus system in Fig. 6 (b). We use default settings
provided in the MATPOWER case ﬁle. We observe results
similar to those for the IEEE 14-bus system, i.e., perturbations

which have a higher value of γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
in terms of attack detection.

C. Simulation Results With Dynamic Load
In the next set of simulations, we consider dynamic load.
We use a load data trace from New York state for one day
(25-JAN-2016) [31] sampled hourly, and feed it to the IEEE
14-bus system. The simulations are performed every hour. At
each hour, COPF,t is computed by solving (1) with the load
input of the corresponding hour. On the other hand, C(cid:48)
OPF,t(cid:48) is
computed by solving (4) assuming that the attacker’s knowl-

edge is outdated by 1 hour. For example, while computing the
MTD H(cid:48)
t(cid:48) at 9 AM, we assume that the attacker has acquired
the knowledge of the measurement matrix Ht at 8 AM. (Recall
from our previous discussion in Sec. IV-A that hourly MTD
perturbations are realistic for practical systems.)
MTD Tradeoff: In Fig. 9, we plot of the tradeoff between
η(cid:48)(δ) and the operational cost for data corresponding to 6 PM.
We make the following observations. For low values of η(cid:48)(δ),
the operational cost is nearly zero. However, as γ(Ht, H(cid:48)
t(cid:48))
and consequently η(cid:48)(δ) is increased, the MTD incurs a non-
trivial operational cost. In particular, the cost increases steeply
for values of η(cid:48)(δ) very close to 1. E.g., for δ = 0.9, an
increase in the value of η(cid:48)(δ) from 0.8 to 0.9 changes the MTD
operational cost from 0.96% to 2.31%. These results suggest
that the defender must carefully choose an appropriate level
of attack detection while taking into account the increase in
operational cost.
MTD Operational Cost Over a Day: We also perform
simulations to show how the cost varies over the day. At each
hour, we adjust the subspace angle threshold γth numerically
such that
the MTD perturbation achieves effectiveness of
η(cid:48)(0.9) ≥ 0.9. The corresponding value of γ(Ht(cid:48), H(cid:48)
t(cid:48)) is
shown in Fig. 11. The rest of the bus settings is identical
to the previous simulation. The variation of MTD operational
cost and the aggregate load are shown in Fig. 10. It can be
observed that the MTD operational cost increases at higher
load. This can be explained as follows. When the system load
is low, there will be a signiﬁcant buffer capacity between the
branch power ﬂows and the corresponding ﬂow limits. If the
difference in power ﬂows between the two systems (with and
without MTD) is within the buffer capacity, then the generator
dispatch in the two systems will be identical (or close to each
other). Thus, the corresponding MTD cost is low. At higher
loads, the power system is signiﬁcantly congested, and the
branch power ﬂows of the two systems (with and without
