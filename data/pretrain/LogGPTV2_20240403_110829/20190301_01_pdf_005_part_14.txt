sufficient to list only the IN and IN OUT arguments. (Specification of argmode is
not compatible with Oracle databases and applies only to Advanced Server.)

The name of an argument. Note that DROP FUNCTION does not actually pay any
attention to argument names, since only the argument data types are needed to
determine the function‟s identity. (Specification of argname is not compatible

argtype
The data type of an argument of the function. (Specification of argtype is not
compatible with Oracle databases and applies only to Advanced Server.)
CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the function (such as operators or
triggers), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects.
RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the function if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

removed – the package specification is not dropped. If BODY is omitted, both the package
specification and body are removed.

2.3.47 DROP PROCEDURE
Name
DROP PROCEDURE -- remove a procedure
Synopsis
DROP PROCEDURE [ IF EXISTS ] name
[ ([ [ argmode ] [ argname ] argtype ] [, ...]) ]
[ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
Description
DROP PROCEDURE removes the definition of an existing procedure. To execute this
command you must be a superuser or the owner of the procedure. All input (IN, IN OUT)
argument data types to the procedure must be specified if this is an overloaded procedure.
(This requirement is not compatible with Oracle databases. In Oracle, only the procedure
name is specified. Advanced Server allows overloading of procedure names, so the
procedure signature given by the input argument data types is required in the Advanced
Server DROP PROCEDURE command of an overloaded procedure.)
Usage of IF EXISTS, CASCADE, or RESTRICT is not compatible with Oracle databases
and is used only by Advanced Server.
Parameters
IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the procedure does not exist. A notice is issued in this
case.
name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing procedure.
argmode
The mode of an argument: IN, IN OUT, or OUT. If omitted, the default is IN. Note
that DROP PROCEDURE does not actually pay any attention to OUT arguments,
since only the input arguments are needed to determine the procedure‟s identity.
So it is sufficient to list only the IN and IN OUT arguments. (Specification of
argmode is not compatible with Oracle databases and applies only to Advanced
Server.)

CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the procedure, and in turn all objects
that depend on those objects.
RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the procedure if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

The following command removes the select_emp procedure.
DROP PROCEDURE select_emp;

2.3.48 DROP PROFILE
Name
DROP PROFILE – drop a user-defined profile
Synopsis
DROP PROFILE [IF EXISTS] profile_name [CASCADE | RESTRICT];
Description
Include the IF EXISTS clause to instruct the server to not throw an error if the specified
profile does not exist. The server will issue a notice if the profile does not exist.
Include the optional CASCADE clause to reassign any users that are currently associated
with the profile to the default profile, and then drop the profile. Include the optional
RESTRICT clause to instruct the server to not drop any profile that is associated with a
role. This is the default behavior.
Parameters
profile_name
The name of the profile being dropped.
Example
The following example drops a profile named acctg_profile:
DROP PROFILE acctg_profile CASCADE;
The command first re-associates any roles associated with the acctg_profile profile
with the default profile, and then drops the acctg_profile profile.
The following example drops a profile named acctg_profile:
DROP PROFILE acctg_profile RESTRICT;
The RESTRICT clause in the command instructs the server to not drop acctg_profile
if there are any roles associated with the profile.

IF EXISTS
Include the IF EXISTS clause to instruct the server to not return an error if the
queue table does not exist. The server will issue a notice.
CASCADE
Include the CASCADE keyword to automatically delete any objects that depend
on the queue table.
RESTRICT
Include the RESTRICT keyword to instruct the server to refuse to delete the
queue table if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

2.3.51 DROP SYNONYM
Name
DROP SYNONYM -- remove a synonym
Synopsis
DROP [PUBLIC] SYNONYM [schema.]syn_name
Description
DROP SYNONYM deletes existing synonyms. To execute this command you must be a
superuser or the owner of the synonym, and have USAGE privileges on the schema in
which the synonym resides.
Parameters:
syn_name
syn_name is the name of the synonym. A synonym name must be unique within
a schema.
schema
schema specifies the name of the schema that the synonym resides in.
Like any other object that can be schema-qualified, you may have two synonyms with the
same name in your search path. To disambiguate the name of the synonym that you are
dropping, include a schema name. Unless a synonym is schema qualified in the DROP
SYNONYM command, Advanced Server deletes the first instance of the synonym it finds in
your search path.
You can optionally include the PUBLIC clause to drop a synonym that resides in the
public schema. The DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM command, compatible with Oracle
databases, drops a synonym that resides in the public schema:
DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM syn_name;
The following example drops the synonym, personnel:
DROP SYNONYM personnel;

2.3.52 DROP ROLE
Name
DROP ROLE -- remove a database role
Synopsis
DROP ROLE name [ CASCADE ]
Description
DROP ROLE removes the specified role. To drop a superuser role, you must be a
superuser yourself; to drop non-superuser roles, you must have CREATEROLE privilege.
A role cannot be removed if it is still referenced in any database of the cluster; an error
will be raised if so. Before dropping the role, you must drop all the objects it owns (or
reassign their ownership) and revoke any privileges the role has been granted.
It is not necessary to remove role memberships involving the role; DROP ROLE
automatically revokes any memberships of the target role in other roles, and of other
roles in the target role. The other roles are not dropped nor otherwise affected.
Alternatively, if the only objects owned by the role belong within a schema that is owned
by the role and has the same name as the role, the CASCADE option can be specified. In
this case the issuer of the DROP ROLE name CASCADE command must be a superuser
and the named role, the schema, and all objects within the schema will be deleted.
Parameters
name
The name of the role to remove.
CASCADE
If specified, also drops the schema owned by, and with the same name as the role
(and all objects owned by the role belonging to the schema) as long as no other
dependencies on the role or the schema exist.

2.3.54 DROP TABLE
Name
DROP TABLE -- remove a table
Synopsis
DROP TABLE name [CASCADE | RESTRICT | CASCADE CONSTRAINTS]
Description
DROP TABLE removes tables from the database. Only its owner may destroy a table. To
empty a table of rows, without destroying the table, use DELETE. DROP TABLE always
removes any indexes, rules, triggers, and constraints that exist for the target table.
Parameters
name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to drop.
Include the RESTRICT keyword to specify that the server should refuse to drop the table
if any objects depend on it. This is the default behavior; the DROP TABLE command will
report an error if any objects depend on the table.
Include the CASCADE clause to drop any objects that depend on the table.
Include the CASCADE CONSTRAINTS clause to specify that Advanced Server should drop
any dependent constraints (excluding other object types) on the specified table.
Examples
The following command drops a table named emp that has no dependencies:
DROP TABLE emp;
The outcome of a DROP TABLE command will vary depending on whether the table has
any dependencies - you can control the outcome by specifying a drop behavior. For
example, if you create two tables, orders and items, where the items table is
dependent on the orders table:
CREATE TABLE orders
(order_id int PRIMARY KEY, order_date date, …);
Copyright © 2007 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 177
Database Compatibility for Oracle® Developers
Reference Guide
CREATE TABLE items
(order_id REFERENCES orders, quantity int, …);
Advanced Server will perform one of the following actions when dropping the orders
table, depending on the drop behavior that you specify:
 If you specify DROP TABLE orders RESTRICT, Advanced Server will report an
error.
 If you specify DROP TABLE orders CASCADE, Advanced Server will drop the
orders table and the items table.
 If you specify DROP TABLE orders CASCADE CONSTRAINTS, Advanced
Server will drop the orders table and remove the foreign key specification from
the items table, but not drop the items table.
