## Background
HavenCo was an offshore data haven established by a group of idealists on the Principality of Sealand, a small artificial island fortress in the North Sea. The location claimed sovereignty due to its unique position and historical context.

- **Sealand's History:**
  - Originally a World War II anti-aircraft platform, Sealand was abandoned by the British in international waters.
  - It was later occupied by pirate radio broadcasters and declared a sovereign nation.
  - Its status has been tested in minor court cases and affirmed, but no direct challenge has ever been made. The general policy is one of non-confrontation.

---

## Why This Talk?
While working at Sealand, it was challenging to see the broader context, and minor issues often seemed major. Several factors motivated this presentation:

- **Commercial Concerns:** These led to both intentional and unintentional optimism.
- **Recent Resolutions:** Some issues have only recently been resolved, and the outcomes were uncertain until now.
- **Limited Public Information:** Press management has been tight, and insiders had little incentive to reveal the truth.
- **Non-NDA Information:** Now that I no longer work at Sealand, I can provide substantial, non-confidential information to the public.

---

## On Confidentiality
- **Public Interest:** The potential harm from discussing these events is less than the risk to the public of continuing without this knowledge.
- **Uncertain Operational Status:** Given the current uncertain operational status of HavenCo, confidentiality concerns are minimized.
- **Independently Rediscovered Information:** Any information covered by NDA has been independently re-discovered using publicly available data.
- **No Access to Confidential Data:** I currently have no access to any confidential information belonging to HavenCo or Sealand.
- **Customer Confidentiality:** Customer confidentiality remains intact.

---

## Mea Culpa
- **Transparency:** A major regret is not being more open with the public earlier about underlying problems.
- **Record-Keeping and Contracts:** Initially, record-keeping and contract negotiations were not as rigorous as they should have been, leading to over-reliance on trust with business partners.
- **Media Influence:** Media attention may have clouded judgment.
- **Future Impact:** It is uncertain whether the next data haven will face easier or harder challenges, but hopefully, customer quality will improve.

## The Idea
- **Global Privacy Laws:** Laws around the world, especially in the U.S., have become increasingly restrictive regarding privacy and internet freedom.
- **Sovereign State Partnership:** By finding a sovereign state willing to explicitly protect these freedoms, a data haven for servers could be established, providing global users with the benefits of such a haven.
- **Security Infrastructure:** High-security server infrastructure, including cryptographic protocols and software, would provide security beyond what the location itself could offer militarily.
- **Replication Model:** This model could be replicated in multiple centers worldwide, making it impossible to target a small number of locations.
- **Minimal Restrictions:** By setting minimal, unchanging restrictions and removing the ability to renege on terms, there would be maximum certainty and freedom for users, and no tough decisions for operators.

## Founding
- **Initial Meeting:** In 1999, the founders met in San Francisco to discuss plans and find a suitable location.
- **Negotiations with Sealand:** Visits to Southend and Sealand were conducted.
- **Funding:** Angel funding was raised from a small number of technology leaders, though the full amount was never successfully secured, even during the 1999/2000 bull market.
- **Relocation:** Ryan moved to the UK/Sealand, while others moved to Amsterdam and Sealand to begin converting Sealand into a data haven and prepare the business.

---

## Launch
- **Wired Magazine Cover:** The launch was featured in Wired magazine, which was done on an accelerated schedule, disrupting timelines.
- **Network Issues:** Winstar UK failed to provision an STM-1 circuit on time, leading to reliance on a single consumer 128Kbps VSAT terminal until winter 2000. This detail was not made public, and customers were deferred.
- **Press Management:** Most of the time was spent dealing with press. No one took responsibility for sales, and there was no ticketing system, resulting in lost or mishandled inquiries.

---

## Launch (Continued)
- **Improved Connectivity:** In late 2000/early 2001, 4xE1 circuits (8M total) from London Telehouse to Cliff House, a tall private office building visible from Sealand, were brought online. A FreeBSD box with 802.11b point-to-point link brought data to Sealand at higher speeds for the first time in January 2001.
- **Initial Customers:** The first customers included personal boxes of insiders and a single offshore stock information source with multiple Windows NT web servers, already using other offshore colocation centers.

---

## Launch (Continued...)
- **Misleading Information:** Press visitors to Sealand were told of racks of machines filling the south tower lower leg, but in reality, the five relay racks above the NOC were mostly empty.
- **Lack of Funding:** Critical technical infrastructure components, such as tamper-resistant server modules and redundant network links, were not deployed due to lack of funding.
- **Payment Processing:** Lack of payment processing crippled new customers, who often had to incorporate in another location and set up banking, rarely returning to get a server on Sealand.
- **Administrative Disorganization:** There was no real accounting, and wages to security staff were paid in cash from personal accounts.

---

## Departures
- **Founder Departures:** Two of the three founders left the company for personal reasons in late summer 2000 and returned to the U.S., leaving Ryan responsible for technical and sales. Prince Michael of Sealand was nominally in charge but focused on his fishing business.
- **Financial Strain:** The company continued to consume money from investors, paid in small increments via Western Union and credit cards, and accumulated substantial expenses with employees.

---

## Departures (Continued)
- **Cost Cutting:** By cutting costs (not paying salaries), HavenCo was break-even on cash costs in summer 2001, and by a marketing stretch, "profitable." Approximately 10 customers, primarily casino gaming.
- **Trend Toward Profitability:** The rate of customer acquisition increased, and costs continued to decrease, leading to a trend toward genuine profitability and success. HAL2001 was a high point of customer growth.
- **Ryan's Sacrifice:** Much of the cost savings came from Ryan living on Sealand full-time, handling all technical (non-marine/power generation and plant maintenance) and sales/business development responsibilities.

---

## Underlying Problem
- **Breach of Agreement:** HavenCo was technically in breach of the original agreement with the Sealand government for not paying large cash sums on schedule. Reduced investor interest and lack of follow-on financing contributed to this, but with Prince Michael as HavenCo's CEO, there was no rush to renegotiate, and a gentlemen's agreement was in place.
- **Unforeseen Consequences:** Little did we realize the extent of the problem this would become.

---

## Coasting and Decline
- **Advisor Involvement:** In Fall 2001, an advisor to Prince Michael's father became involved, initially to advance Sealand's claims of sovereignty with international agencies.
- **Criticism and Interference:** The advisor increasingly criticized HavenCo's laissez-faire attitude, viewing it as a PR liability to Sealand's push for sovereignty. Additional expenses were incurred, such as replacing the working 802.11b link with an expensive telco Nx64 wireless bridge and eliminating backup multi-path 802.11b and redundant connectivity.

---

## Coasting and Decline (Continued)
- **Informal Restrictions:** Informal and inconsistent restrictions were placed on HavenCo's operations but largely ignored. Reporters often received different stories from Sealand and HavenCo during interviews.
- **Covert Initiatives:** Most new initiatives, such as an anonymizing remailer, were undertaken covertly to avoid raising Sealand's and the advisor's interest. Customers were often advised to avoid providing details of their activities, provided they complied with the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).
- **Taxation Concerns:** There was grumbling about applying taxation to Sealand-hosted companies and HavenCo.

---

## Coasting and Decline (Continued...)
- **Cooperation with Authorities:** A policy of "cooperating on the sly with authorities" if hosting a terrorist server was in place, but without adequate technical measures, this was a real possibility.
- **Financial Stability:** HavenCo's financial stability was questionable, with large new expenses, reduced potential for future business, and mounting unpaid debts to insiders.
- **Lack of Formal Agreement:** The lack of a formal operating agreement with Sealand, especially in light of new attempts to restrict business, was a major concern.

---

## Coasting and Decline (Continued.....)
- **Stock Issuance:** HavenCo had not issued stock to investors/employees, despite re-incorporating in Cyprus after moving from Anguilla. Concerns were raised about the nature of the delayâ€”whether it was bad faith or just ineffective management.
- **DoS Attacks:** Several large DoS attacks against HavenCo customers caused outages, with some lasting as long as 3-4 days after the redundant circuits were removed.
- **Connectivity Outage:** The bankruptcy of Winstar, the vendor of the original 4xE1, combined with the involvement of Sealand's advisor, caused a two-month outage where connectivity was completely lost to Sealand. A VSAT link was re-established within a week, but customers complained about 500+ms latency and low bandwidth, causing many to leave and halting growth.

---

## Selling Out/Ultimatum
- **Potential Business Opportunities:** During 2002, several large and potentially profitable businesses approached HavenCo after extensive negotiations to arrange hosting.
- **Online Movie Rental Business:** One such business, an online movie rental service, met in London with Ryan, Michael, and Sealand advisors. They offered to host and comply with all laws but were ultimately rejected by Sealand's advisors due to potential negative publicity.
- **Legal Status Concerns:** If Sealand was so concerned about negative publicity, did they have faith in their legal status?
