Background
Background
HavenCo was an offshore datahaven created by several 
idealists on the Principality of Sealand, a tiny artificial island 
fortess in th North Sea which claimed sovereignty due to 
location and history
Sealand was a WW2 anti-aircraft platform abandoned by the 
British in international waters, subsequently occupied by 
pirate radio broadcasters and declared a sovereign nation
•
Status has been tested in minor court cases and affirmed, 
but no head-on challenge has ever been waged, and general 
policy of non-confrontation

Why this talk?
Why this talk?
While working at Sealand, it was difficult to see the greater 
context; minor issues seemed major
Commercial concerns caused optimism (intentional and 
unintentional)
Some issues have only recently been resolved; no one knew 
what would happen until recently
Very little information has been made public; press has been 
carefully managed.  Insiders have no incentive to reveal the 
truth
Now that I no longer work on Sealand, I can provide 
substantial non-NDA information to the public

 On Confidentiality
On Confidentiality
Harm from discussing what happened is less than the risk to 
the public in continuing to operate without this knowledge
Since the company is of uncertain operational status now, is 
there confidentiality for HavenCo
Anything covered by NDA has been independently re-
discovered using only information available to outsiders
I have no current access to any confidential information 
belonging to HavenCo or Sealand
Customer confidentiality maintained

 ““Mea culpa”
Mea culpa”
Major misgiving about the whole thing is not being more 
open with the public earlier about the underling problems
Certainly initially I wasn't keeping records and negotiating 
contracts as well as by the end; over-reliance on trust with 
business partners
Probably the media attention got in the way of good 
judgement
Not sure if it will be easier or harder for the next datahaven 
as a result; hopefully quality for customers will be increased

Idea
Idea
Laws around the world, and in the US particularly, with 
respect to privacy and Internet freedom have become 
increasingly restrictive
By finding a sovereign state willing to agree to explicitly 
protect these freedoms, a data haven for servers could be 
established, allowing users around the world the benefits of 
this data haven

Idea (continued)
Idea (continued)
High security server infrastructure, including cryptographic 
protocols and software to distribute and secure applications, 
would provide security in excess of what the location itself 
could militarily.
Eventually, this model could be replicated in many centers 
around the  world, making it impossible to go after a small 
number of targets
By making any restrictions upfront, minimal, and 
unchanging, and removing the ability to renege on terms 
later, there would be maximum certainty and freedom for 
users and no tough decisions for the operators

Negotiations with Sealand; visiting Southend and Sealand
Raising angel funding from a small number of technology 
leaders (never successfully raised the full amount, even in 
the bull market of 1999/2000, due to lack of organization)
Ryan moved to the UK/Sealand, others moved to 
Amsterdam and Sealand to begin conversion of Sealand into 
a datahaven and prepare the busines

Launch
Launch
Launch with the cover of Wired magazine, which was done 
on an accelerated schedule, throwing off timelines
Winstar UK failed to provision STM-1 circuit in time, leading 
to reliance on a single consumer 128Kbps tachyon VSAT 
terminal until winter 2000.  This detail was not made public; 
instead, customers were deferred.
Almost all time was spent dealing with press.  No one took 
responsibility for sales, and there was no ticketing system, 
so basically all initial inquiries were lost or mishandled. (as 
has happened with many launches, such as DigiCash)

Launch (continued)
In late 2000/early 2001, 4xE1 circuits (8M total) from London 
Telehouse to Cliff House, a tall private office building visible 
on the shore of Felixstowe from Sealand, were brought 
online.  A FreeBSD box with 802.11b  point-to-point brought 
data out to Sealand at higher speeds for the first time in 
January 2001.
Initial customers were insiders personal boxes and a single 
offshore stock information source with multiple Windows NT 
web servers, already using other offshore colocation centers

Launch (continued...)
Press visitors to Sealand were told of the racks of machines 
filling the south tower lower leg; in reality, the 5 relay racks 
standing mostly empty above the NOC were the entirety of 
equipment.
Critical components of technical infrastructure (tamper-
resistant server modules, redundant network links via 
multiple paths, etc.) were not deployed for lack of funding.
Lack of payment processing crippled new customers -- 
generally one was forced to incorporate in another location, 
get banking there, and once that had been done, rarely did 
potential customers come back to get a server on Sealand.
Administrative operations disorganized; no real accounting, 
and wages to security staff paid in cash from personal 
accounts

Departures
Departures
Two of the 3 founders left the company for personal reasons in 
late  summer 2000 and returned to the US, leaving Ryan 
responsible for technical and sales, with Prince Michael of 
Sealand nominally in charge of the company, but primarily 
focused on his own fishing business
The company continued to consume money from investors, 
paid in small  increments via Western Union and credit 
cards, as well as accumulated a very substantial expense 
balance with employees

Depatures (continued)
Depatures (continued)
Few new customers came, but by cutting costs (not paying 
salaries),  HavenCo was basically break even in summer 
2001 on cash costs, and thus by a marketing stretch, 
"profitable".  Approximately 10 customers, primarily casino 
gaming
Rate of customer acquisition increased, and costs continued to 
decrease, so general trend was toward genuine profitability 
and success.  HAL2001 was a high point of customer growth
Much cost savings came from Ryan living on Sealand full-time, 
responsible for all technical (non-marine/power generation 
and plant maintenance) and handling sales/bizdev/etc. while 
there.  A sacrifice, but worthwhile for eventual success

Underlying problem
Underlying problem
HavenCo was technically in breach of original agreement with 
Sealand  government for not paying large cash sums on 
schedule to Sealand, due to  reduced investor interest and 
no follow-on financing, but with Prince  Michael as 
HavenCo's CEO, there was no rush to renegotiate, and there 
was a gentlemen's agreement that terms would be largely 
unchanged
Little did we realize what a problem this would become...

Coasting and Decline
Coasting and Decline
In Fall 2001, an advisor to Prince Michael's father became 
involved. Initially, was to try to advance Sealand's claims of 
sovereignty with international agencies, due to experience 
interacting with those agencies.
Increasingly, this advisor took advantage of proximity to 
Michael to criticize the lassiez-faire attitude of HavenCo, and 
belief that it was a PR liability to Sealand's push for 
sovereignty.  Additional expenses were also incurred, such 
as replacing the working 802.11b link with expensive telco 
Nx64 wireless bridge, and eliminating backup multi-path 
802.11b and redundant connectivity, due to advisor.

Informal and inconsistent restrictions were placed on 
HavenCo's operations, but largely ignored, in the truest form 
of banana republic.  Reporters would often be given different 
stories by Sealand and HavenCo during interviews, with 
HavenCo going by the terms of original contracts, and 
Sealand and its advisor believing in the "norms of 
international practice and custom" and  "nothing which 
would be offensive" (how British)

Most new initiatives during this period(anonyimzing remailer, 
one of the most popular HavenCo services ever, discounted 
servers for open source projects, etc. ) were undertaken 
somewhat covertly to avoid raising the  interest of Sealand 
and advisors.  Often customers were told after initial contact 
to avoid providing further details of exactly what they were 
doing, provided they complied with AUP, to avoid causing 
interest by Sealand.

"If we were hosting a terrorist server, we'd cooperate on the 
sly with the authorities" policy; without adequate technical 
measures (tamper resistant machines, and at least 
encrypted disks), this was a very real possibility.
Financial stability of HavenCo continued to be questionable -- 
large new expenses, coupled with reduced potential for 
future business, and mounting unpaid debts to insiders.
Also, lack of formal operating agreement with Sealand, 
especially in light of new attempts to restrict business, was 
a major concern

HavenCo had not issued stock to investors/employees/etc., 
despite re-incorporating for this purpose in Cyprus after 
moving from Anguilla.   Concerns raised as to nature of 
delay -- bad faith, or just ineffective  management?
Several large DoS attacks against HavenCo customers caused 
outages, as well as equipment outages.  Some outages 
lasted as long as 3-4 days once the redundant circuits were 
removed.

Bankruptcy of Winstar, vendor of the original 4xE1, combined 
with  involvement of Sealand's advisor (also a telcomms 
"expert"), caused >2 month outage where connectivity was 
completely lost to Sealand.  Within a week, a VSAT link was 
re-established, but customers continually complained about 
500+ms latency and very low bandwidth, causing many to 
leave and eliminating growth.
. Sealand people only present when press visits underway; 
otherwise it was 1-2 people, including Ryan

Selling out/Ultimatum
Selling out/Ultimatum
During 2002, several very large and potential profitable 
businesses came to HavenCo after extensive negotiations 
and tried to arrange hosting
One, an online movie rental business, met in London with 
Ryan, Michael, and Sealand advisors.  They offered to host 
and comply with all laws, but  were ultimately nixed by 
Sealand's advisors due to potential for negativepublicity.
If Sealand was so concerned about negative publicity, did they 
have faith  in their legal status?
