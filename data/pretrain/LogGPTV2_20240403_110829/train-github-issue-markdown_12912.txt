For the admin interface of eZ Platform 2.0, we are developing an application
where the navigation happens with AJAX request. After an AJAX request
corresponding to the navigation, the following is code is run:
    Sfjs.load(
        document.querySelector('.sf-toolbar').id,
        `/_wdt/${debugTokenFromHttpHeader}`
    );
so that the toolbar is updated as if the full page was generated
(implementation of this feature request #15456)
Somehow, this is working (the toolbar is updated for instance the Route name,
the timing or the memory usage are updated) but after calling `load` the
toolbar is buggy in the following ways:
  1. if it's was minimized, it becomes maximized
  2. it's impossible to minimized it again, clicking on _Close Toolbar_ link has no effect
  3. if the page does others AJAX requests, the AJAX requests counter is correctly updated, but it keeps on blinking even after the end of those requests
