I am currently developing a web application using AngularJS, Webapp2, and the Python Google App Engine environment. The application is designed to include all the features of a modern social network, such as user management, posts, likes, and comments. I would like the page hierarchy to be structured as follows, with the main pages served by the server and sub-pages managed via Angular routes:

- **Index**
  - Learn More
  - Sign Up
  - Log In

- **Feed Page**
  - Popular Feed
  - Following Feed

- **Profile**
  - Interactions
  - Posts

- **Settings**
  - Profile
  - Account

The challenge I'm facing is that when a user navigates to `/signup`, I want them to see the index page with the sign-up route preloaded. How can I configure the server to preload an Angular route in the response?

**Solution:**

To address this, you can structure your application so that the main pages (e.g., Index, Log In, Sign Up) are served as individual server-rendered pages without client-side routing. This means that each of these pages will have its own URL and will be handled by the server. For example, `/signup` would directly serve the sign-up page.

Once the user successfully logs in, you can then serve a single-page application (SPA) that uses Angular for client-side routing. This SPA will handle all the subsequent views, such as the feed, profile, and settings, through Angular routes.

Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how you can implement this:

1. **Server-Side Configuration:**
   - Configure Webapp2 to serve the `index.html` file for the main pages (e.g., `/`, `/login`, `/signup`).
   - Ensure that the `index.html` file includes the necessary AngularJS setup and the appropriate initial view (e.g., sign-up form).

2. **AngularJS Configuration:**
   - Set up AngularJS routing to handle the sub-pages (e.g., feed, profile, settings) within the SPA.
   - Use AngularJS to dynamically load the appropriate content based on the route.

3. **User Authentication:**
   - After a successful login, redirect the user to the main SPA entry point (e.g., `/feed`).
   - From this point, all navigation within the app will be handled by AngularJS.

By following this approach, you can ensure that users can navigate to `/signup` and see the sign-up page directly, while still leveraging AngularJS for the dynamic and interactive parts of your application.
