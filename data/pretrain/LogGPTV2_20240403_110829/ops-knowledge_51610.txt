User: I'm currently building a web application using AngularJS, Webapp2, and the Python Google App Engine environment. This app is supposed to have all the features of modern social networks (users, posts, likes, comments). I want the page hierarchy to look like this, the main pages are from the server and the sub pages are supposed to be angular routes:

The problem is that when a user wants to signup I want them to be able to go to /signup and get the index page with the signup route loaded. How can I get the server to preload an angular route from the response
Assistant: I'm working on the same stack and the way we do it is that we have the main pages (index, login, signup) configured as regular individual pages where we use angular without routing. Any page that anonymous users will access will be such pages which work over server side routing. But once the user login is successful we serve a page which will start serving other views through client side routing.
