User:  web application logs more than 10GB per day, placing high demands on system and storage resources. Please provide a log management solution.
Assistant: Log management solutions: 1. Decentralized logging: Distribute logs to different servers to reduce the burden on a single server. 2. Database storage: Logs are stored in a database and indexed so that logs can be quickly accessed and analyzed through queries. You can use NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra to store and manage logs. 3. Data warehouse solution: Using off-the-shelf big data solutions, such as Hadoop and Spark, log data can be saved in the data warehouse. Storage capacity can be expanded using Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), while log data can be analyzed using Spark as an analysis framework. 4. Log cutting: Cut the log into multiple files according to date, size or other rules. You can use a tool like logrotate to periodically cut log files. 5. Automatic Cleanup: Use Cron jobs or other scheduled task tools to automatically clean up old logs. 6. Monitoring and alerting: Implement an effective monitoring and alerting system to monitor the usage of logging and storage resources, and notify managers to make corresponding adjustments when needed. The above are some feasible solutions, and the specific solutions need to be adjusted and optimized according to the needs and resources in the actual situation.
