# Hydra: An Advanced x86 Polymorphic Engine

## Overview
Hydra is an advanced x8ctor polymorphic engine that integrates both existing and novel techniques into a single, cohesive package. All features, with the exception of one, are operating system-independent.

### Key Features

#### Random Register Operations
- **Synonymous Instructions:** Each invocation uses different synonymous instructions.
- **Instruction Library:** Hydra provides a comprehensive library of such instructions and a platform to add more.
- **Key Generation:** For some operations, a random key is generated to further obfuscate the payload.

#### Two Methods to Clear a Register
1. **Method 1:**
   ```assembly
   mov reg, 0
   sub reg, reg
   ```
2. **Method 2:**
   ```assembly
   push dword 0
   pop reg
   sub reg, reg
   ```

#### Recursive NOP Generator
- **Traditional Limitations:** Traditional shellcode engines use a static array of possible NOPs, which lacks randomness.
- **Dynamic Library:** Hydra employs a built-in "NOP generator" that dynamically builds a library of possible NOP instructions.
- **Brute-Force Discovery:** Finds all 1-byte NOPs by brute force and extends this to larger NOPs recursively.
- **Extensive Library:** Over 1.9 million NOP instructions have been discovered.

**Usage in Decoders:**
- **Variability:** NOP instructions can be interspersed between decoder instructions, adding variability to the size and content.
- **Types of NOPs:**
  - **Normal NOPs:** Standard no-operation instructions.
  - **State-Safe NOPs:** Do not modify the environment (stack, registers, flow control) and must be used between instructions to preserve state.

#### Multi-Layer Ciphering
- **Random Ciphers:** Hydra randomly selects ciphers for the payload.
- **Cipher Operations:** Includes ror, rol, xor, add, sub, etc.
- **Random Order and Keys:** The cipher order and 32-bit keys are randomized each time.
- **Default Rounds:** Six rounds of ciphering by default, but arbitrary rounds can be specified.

#### ASCII Encoder
- **Text-Based Protocols:** Useful for sending ASCII payloads to text-based protocols like HTTP to evade anomaly sensors.
- **ASCII NOPs:** Chooses from over 4000 ASCII NOPs generated by the NOP-generator.
- **Integration:** ASCII NOPs are inserted between decoder instructions and shellcode to further obfuscate both content and size.
- **Modular Design:** Can be combined with any or all other options.

#### Bi-partite Decoding
- **Signature Evasion:** Static decoders are easily detected by IDS systems.
- **Dynamically Generated Decoders:** Hydra uses non-contiguous decoders with different instructions, keys, and positions each time.
- **Current Implementation:** Decoders wrap around the payload, with the ultimate goal of tighter integration within the payload.

#### Spectrum Shaping
- **Statistical Mimicry:** Pads shellcode with bytes to make it statistically similar to normal traffic.
- **Training:** Automatically trains on sample files to learn the target byte distribution.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Uses Monte Carlo simulation to mimic the learned distribution.
- **Adjustable Spacing:** Allows for adjustable spacing and higher-byte mimicry (under development).

#### Randomized Address Zone
- **Address Overwriting:** Replaces %esp on the stack to point to the payload.
- **Signature Breaking:** Adds random offsets to each address in the return zone to break simple IDS signatures.

#### Forking Shellcode
- **Process Recovery:** Forks the shellcode so the child process executes the payload while the parent attempts to recover the exploited process.
- **Relative Offset:** Requires knowledge of the target process's address space for recovery.

#### Time-Cipher Shellcode
- **Emulator Evasion:** Designed to evade emulators that dynamically execute network traffic.
- **Time-Based Key:** Uses the most significant bytes of the `time()` syscall result as the key.
- **Cipher Chaining:** Utilizes time as the initialization vector for cipher chaining.
- **Shell-Life:** Sets a "shell-life" for the code, making it valid only for a short period.
