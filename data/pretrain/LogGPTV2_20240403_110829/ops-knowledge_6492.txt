User: How to check the system load on a Linux machine and analyze the cause of the high load?
Assistant: You can use the following command to check the system load of the Linux machine: ``` uptime ``` or ``` top ``` Among them, uptime will display the average load of the system, including the load of 1 minute, 5 minutes and 15 minutes , while top will display the detailed information of some key processes, including CPU usage, memory usage, process list, etc. If the system load is too high, you can further use the following command to analyze the cause: ``` ps auxf ``` Through this command, you can view the process information running in the current system, and you can track and monitor the processes that occupy high CPU or high memory debugging. ``` sar ``` Through this command, you can obtain the resource usage of the system, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, as well as various performance indicators. Through the analysis of these data, you can find the bottleneck of system resources. ``` dmesg ``` Through this command, you can view the kernel log of the system, and learn more about some abnormal situations that occur in the system. Through the use and analysis of the above commands, you can effectively find the reason for the high system load, and perform targeted optimization and adjustment to improve system performance and stability.
