User: What is Kubernetes (K8s), what are its features and uses? How to use K8s to deploy and manage containerized applications?
Assistant: Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration and management platform originally designed and maintained by Google to help developers and system administrators better manage, scale and deploy containerized applications. It provides a unified way to manage multiple containers and their dependencies and resource requirements. The characteristics and uses of Kubernetes include: 1. Automatically deploy, expand and upgrade containerized applications 2. Automatic fault tolerance and self-healing capabilities to ensure high availability and stability of the system 3. Realize functions such as load balancing, failover and service discovery 4. Support multi-cloud, hybrid cloud and private cloud deployment 5. Provide powerful security, monitoring and logging functions To use Kubernetes to deploy and manage containerized applications, the following steps are required: 1. Create a cluster on Kubernetes, including the master node and Work node 2. Package the application into a Docker image and upload it to the Docker image warehouse 3. Define the Deployment object and Service object of the application, including container image, number of containers, resource limits, etc. 4. Deploy the application, and use the Service object to It is exposed to external traffic 5. Operations such as monitoring, expansion, upgrade, and rollback can be performed through Kubernetes Dashboard, command line, and API. In short, Kubernetes is a powerful and widely used container orchestration and management platform, which can greatly simplify the deployment and management of containerized applications, and improve the reliability and scalability of the system.
