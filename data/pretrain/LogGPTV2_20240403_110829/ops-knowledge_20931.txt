User: What indicators need to be monitored during system monitoring? Please describe the role and impact of each indicator separately.
Assistant: During system monitoring, common indicators include: 1. CPU usage: Monitor CPU usage to know whether the CPU is overloaded or insufficient, whether there is a waste of CPU resources or unreasonable configuration. 2. Memory usage: Monitor the system memory usage to know whether the memory is sufficient, whether there is a memory leak or unreasonable configuration. 3. Disk usage: Monitor the disk storage occupancy to know whether the disk space is sufficient, whether there is insufficient disk space or unreasonable storage. 4. Network traffic: Monitor the size of network transmission traffic to know whether the network bandwidth is sufficient, whether there is network congestion or bandwidth waste. 5. Response time: Monitor the response time of the system to know whether the system performance is stable, whether there is delay or slow response. 6. Processor queue length: Monitor the length of the processor queue to know whether the system load is too high, whether there is a request accumulation or slow response. 7. Number of processes: Monitor the number of system processes to understand whether system resources are used reasonably, and whether there are excessive or abused processes. The above indicators can help administrators quickly understand the running status of the system, discover potential problems, optimize and adjust them, and ensure the stability and performance of the system.
