 **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
1000's of warning messages on the console increase the memory usage of an app
until the app crashes, and duplicate warning messages are not needed. Also,
the warning message are generated when a specific device doesn't have a
specific capability, even though the functionality of the app works, but will
cause the app to crash when running for a length of time because the extra
warning console messages use up the memory.
**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to request that all console messages ( log, info, warn, error )
be removed from the code and replaced by a console message handler that
provides the option of setting the log level as well as options to remove
duplicate messages and an option to pass a function to it for an alternative
logging system to allow for logging systems such as Winston that allow for
remote logging.
**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Replacing the built-in console message functions is not a good solution.
**Additional context**
This is an easy feature add, I could do it myself and submit a PR if I know it
will get accepted.
