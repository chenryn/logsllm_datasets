### Introduction
**Prayer for the Infosec Professional:**

"Grant me the serenity to accept people who will not secure their networks, the courage to face them when they blame me for their problems, and the wisdom to go out drinking afterwards."

### "You’re Doing It Wrong"
This phrase means that the method you are using is not creating the desired result.

---

### Your Mission
Design and implement a physical security system for a new facility, including multi-factor authentication and video surveillance.

### Proper Previous Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance

### What is Physical Security?
Physical security encompasses measures that prevent or deter attackers from accessing a facility, resource, or information stored on physical media. It also includes guidance on designing structures to resist various hostile acts.

### Methodology
#### 1. Assessment
A thorough examination of the facility to be protected, including:
- Scope of property to be protected
- Established points of entry and egress
- Potential points of entry and egress
- Existing security measures
- Evaluation of physical property
- Risk assessment

#### 2. Assignment
Establish the required level of security for specific areas and assets within the facility:
- **High Level:**
  - Data Centers
  - Executive Offices
  - Finance & Accounting
- **Medium Level:**
  - Entry & Egress
  - Reception
  - Elevators
- **Low Level:**
  - Common Areas
  - Cubicle Farms

Considerations:
- Insurance requirements
- Compliance requirements
- Fire code requirements
- Business requirements

#### 3. Arrangement
Establish the most effective locations for security devices based on their requirements:
- **Cameras:**
  - Field of view
  - Redundancy
  - Tracking
- **Doorways:**
  - Type of locks
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Time-based restrictions
- **Central Control:**
  - Cabling limitations
  - Power, archiving, and disaster planning

#### 4. Approval
Submit all plans, costs, schedules, and related data to management:
- **Hardware:**
  - Quotes from multiple vendors
  - Lifetime requirements
  - Service plans
- **Costs:**
  - Plan A, B, and C
  - Flexibility
  - Options
- **Schedule:**
  - Time frame for completion
  - Interference with business operations

#### 5. Action
Implementing the physical installation and configuration of the approved system:
- **Construction:**
  - Oversee construction
  - Oversee inspections by state/local government
  - Manage corrections
- **Training:**
  - Security officers
  - Users
  - Establishing policy & procedure
- **Testing:**
  - Ensuring the system works as planned
  - Compliance testing

### What Could Possibly Go Wrong?
"No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength."
- **Count Helmuth von Moltke**

---

### Management
**Pros:**
- Provide budget
- Set requirements
- Sign your paycheck
- Run the show

**Cons:**
- They know this

---

### Strife
**Example 1:**
- **CEO:** "I want a state-of-the-art, high-tech system. FBI, CIA kind of security."
- **Response:** "I can do that. Based on your needs and the floor plan, it will cost $54,875."
- **CEO:** "Can’t you just buy something from Costco?"

**Example 2:**
- **CEO:** "I went to Best Buy and saw an HDMI cable for $50. I went home and surfed the internet for a while and found the same cable for $2 from a website in China. If I can do that for a cable, I expect you to do the same thing for my security system."

---

### Best Practices
- Be knowledgeable about the equipment, methodology, and best practices for your industry.
- Understand the impact your project will have on business and user activity.
- Rely on facts, not speculation, theory, rumors, or maybes.
- Present facts, support with documentation, explain risk and impact, and prove mitigation.
- Present in a factual and respectful manner, showing your work and explaining your reasoning behind the design.
- If you don’t know, state that you will research and return with the answers.
- Be prepared to lose gracefully.

### Success
**Example:**
- **Visitor, Friend of CEO of Information Security Firm:** "This is one hell of a security system. Whoever did this knew what the hell they were doing."

---

### Motivation
"Shut up, get it done, failure is not an option."
- **Charles Rawls, VP of Ass Kicking, Dorsai Embassy, Earth**
