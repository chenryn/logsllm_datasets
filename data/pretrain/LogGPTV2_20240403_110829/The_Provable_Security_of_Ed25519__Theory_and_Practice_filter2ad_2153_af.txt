The reduction B gets as input a public key A and invokes
the SUF-CMA adversary A(A). For any of the maximal Q

S
of the simulator Sim (cf. Fig. 6) to obtain valid conversations
(R, ch, S) and patches the random oracle H to return ch on

response (R, S) to A is a valid signature from A’s point of

inputs that had not been patched by a signature query, the latter
are answered consistently with the patching. Note that to run
the simulation of A, B has made no signing query to its own
OSign. Thus, once A outputs its strong forgery (m(cid:3), σ(cid:3)), B
can immediately output the same pair as its existential forgery.
Note that since R(cid:3) (cid:7)= R
(cid:3), H has not been patched by B on
(R(cid:3), A, m(cid:3)).

(A, R, H(R, A, m(cid:3)), S) it is clear by the same argument that
there cannot be a strong forgery with S(cid:3) (cid:7)= S
To conclude, since the probability of computing non-unique
responses in CID is 0 and the signature scheme does not
admit existential forgeries with non-negligible probability, the
probability of an adversary A succeeding against the strong
unforgeability is also negligible.

The proofs so far capture adversary attacking a single key,

the interested reader to Appendix C.
2Note that there is a very small probability that there exist two different
encodings R1, R2 such that they decode to the same element R. This is
due to the fact that elements in E(Fq) are encoded as b bit strings with a
(b − 1)-bit encoding for the y coordinate, plus one bit for the sign of x. Thus
the entire valid encoding space for the y coordinate encompasses integers
from 0 to 2b−1 − 1 = 2255 − 1, whereas Fq contains only the integers from
0 to 2255 − 20. Nevertheless, Case 1 in the reduction also captures this.
C. Key Substitution Attacks
Key Substitution Attacks (KSA) were ﬁrst introduced by
Blake-Wilson and Menezes [60] and later formalized by Smart
and Menezes [32]. Informally, KSA cover the scenario where
an adversary learns one or more (message,signature)-pairs for
a given public key, and wishes to ﬁnd a different public key
and message such that one of the valid signatures verify under
the adversary’s new public key. Maliciously generated public
keys fall outside the traditional notions for signature security
such as existential unforgeability. However, these attacks have
practical consequences in real-world contexts: examples include
an attack on the popular Let’s Encrypt Certiﬁcate Issuance
protocol that allowed an attacker to impersonate any website,
compromise of conﬁdentiality in the WS-Security Standard,
and attacks on the well known Station to Station protocol [4].
Comparatively few publications have investigated key substi-
tution attacks and how they apply to different signature schemes.
Consequently, many signature schemes are vulnerable. For
example, [32] described a KSA on the Gennaro-Halevi-Rabin
signature scheme [61] and the standard-model secure scheme by
Boneh and Boyen [62] also proved to be vulnerable [63]. While
these schemes are more of an academic interest, [60], [63]
also showed that under certain conditions the widely-deployed
RSA, DSA, and ECDSA signatures are insecure against KSA
adversaries. Menezes and Smart also highlighted the relevance
of key-substitution [32] to the multi-user setting.
In [19], a practical scheme for email authentication is
proposed that requires the underlying signature scheme to
be resistant to key substitution attacks. In this paper, it is stated
that Schnorr signatures in prime order groups achieve SUF-
CMA and resistance to key substitution attacks. The paper
goes on to claim these results transfer to a variant of Ed25519
without key preﬁxing. We have already seen that this is not
true in general and we also point out that it is not correct
for their modiﬁed form of Ed25519. In particular, absent key
preﬁxing, an adversary can submit a mangled public key lying
outside the prime order group which is a distinct bitstring from
the ‘honest’ signature yet passes the veriﬁcation checks. Later
in this section we consider Ed25519 with key-preﬁxing and
ﬁnd the opposite result, that this attack is provably prevented.
In the following, we investigate the resistance of Ed25519
against various exclusive ownership deﬁnitions from [5] which
rule out multiple key substitution attacks. Theorem 5 shows that
Ed25519 achieves this stronger version, cf. Deﬁnition 11, where
the adversary is allowed to adaptively query the signing oracle
to learn (message,signature)-pairs of its choice and may choose
which signature to attack. Furthermore, we show in Theorem 6
that Ed25519 has so-called message-bound signatures (cf.
Deﬁnition 12), i.e., that there exist no two distinct messages
for which the same signature would verify with respect to a
given (potentially maliciously generated) public key. Lastly,
Theorem 7 shows that if small order elements are rejected,
even malicious strong universal exclusive ownership guarantees
are provided. We give the proofs for Theorems 5, 6, and 7 in
Appendix B. Firstly, we ﬁnd that an adversary cannot substitute

Provided small subgroup elements are rejected, this property
also holds. However, there is a straightforward attack if they
are accepted where the adversary chooses its public key to be
two distinct low order elements.

VI. CONCLUSION
We proved that Ed25519 achieves its goal of existential
unforgeability (EUF-CMA), as is assumed by many published
works. While Ed25519 seems similar to Fiat-Shamir applied
to the Schnorr identiﬁcation scheme, the devil is in the detail.
We took into account the non-prime order group, the clamping
of private scalars and many other details.
Moreover, we also proved that Ed25519-IETF achieves
SUF-CMA. We proved that all Ed25519 schemes resilient
against key substitution attacks, however, we also showed that
rejecting small order elements does yield additional properties,
enabling Ed25519-LibS to achieve an even stronger form of
key substitution resilience as well as message bound security.
Our results, summarized in Table I, thereby provide not
only theoretical foundations, but also meaningful insights for
choosing among the variants.

Ed25519 = (KGen, Sign, Vfy) be as deﬁned in Fig. 4, where

Ed25519 is (, QS, QH)-S-UEO secure,  ≤ 2·QH·(cid:13) 22b

where QS and QH are the maximum numbers of queries to
OSign and H.
We also ﬁnd that, even when the signer is dishonest, Ed25519
schemes which reject public keys and signatures with low order
elements, ensure that for a particular public key, signatures
can only verify under a single message. However, if low order
elements are accepted, an adversary can submit a low order
element as their public key and any value for their signature
such that SB = R. The resulting signature veriﬁes under any
message. This was pointed out in [1] but deemed unproblematic.
