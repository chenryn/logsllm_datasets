Assistant: Automated testing refers to a method of automatically executing test cases by using technical means such as tools, scripts, and programs during the software development process. Python is a popular programming language that can be used to write automated test scripts. Here is a sample code that uses Python and Selenium WebDriver to test an actual website: ```python from selenium import webdriver # Create a Firefox WebDriver instance driver = webdriver.Firefox() # Open the website homepage driver.get("https:/ /www.google.com/") # Enter keywords in the search box search_box = driver.find_element_by_name("q") search_box.send_keys("Python automated testing") # Submit search requests search_box.submit() # Verify search results Does the page title contain keywords assert "Python automated testing" in driver.title # Close the browser driver.quit() ``` This sample code uses Python and Selenium WebDriver to open the Google website, search for Python automated testing related content, and verify the search Whether the result page title contains keywords. You can also use a similar method to write automated test scripts that suit you, automatically execute test cases, and improve test efficiency.
