Note that the x-axis in Figure 11(b) is log scale, while that of Fig-
ure 11(a) is in linear scale and covers only up to 10, 000. Beyond
x = 10, 000, a very small number of points exist in Figure 11; al-
most one data point for each value of x, if any. Figure 11(b) ﬁts well
onto the line, y = x, up to about x = 1, 000. Beyond x = 1, 000,
it is hard to interpret the data points, as there are a limited number
of data points.
In the Cyworld activity network, the ratio of the number of mes-
sages received against that of messages sent pair-wise is ﬁxed to
1. In his pioneering work of operational deﬁnition for reciprocity,
Hemelrijk has distinguishes three types of reciprocity: ‘relative’,
‘absolute’, and ‘qualitative’ [22]. According to his classiﬁcation,
the reciprocity in the activity network is close to ‘absolute’; Hemel-
rijk projects that ‘absolute’ reciprocity is expected when there are
no differences in individuals’ capacities. His interpretation still
holds in our problem setting as the development of technology
gives a nearly equal power to all users in electronic communica-
tion. Cyworld facilitates users to surf to friends’ homepages by
simply clicking a button, and has almost no barrier for any users.
To quantify the reciprocity in the activity network, we use link
reciprocity deﬁned in [43]. When user i wrote p messages to user
j and user j wrote q messages to user i, we measure the correla-
tion between p and q, which map to wij and wji in our case. We
use Garlaschelli and Loffredo’s method to calculate the reciprocity
coefﬁcient ρ of the entire network based on link reciprocity [16].

ity networks, but only 20 random networks for the last and largest
activity network from Januanry 2005. Motif analysis is computa-
tionally costly and the computation of motifs from June 2004 took
more than two weeks on our 64-bit 3.4 GHz dual-core Intel Xeon
dual-processor server with 8 GB main memory. We had to curb the
number of random networks for the January 2005 network.
Figure 13: Normalized Z-scores of ﬁve activity networks
Figure 13 shows the result of motif analysis. We observe that
transitive motifs (motifs 9, 10, 12, and 13 in Figure 13) are abun-
dant, while intransitive motifs (motifs 4, 5, 6 in Figure 13) are
rarely constructed in Cyworld. These ﬁndings comply with results
from small-scale social networks in [28]. The normalized Z-scores
for motifs 1 and 2 in Figure 13 deviate from what we expect in so-
cial networks. Both motifs are intransitive relations: motif 1 is a
broadcasting type. A user writes to others, but they do not know
each other nor respond back to the writer. Motif 2 presents the op-
posite relations. Two users do not know each other, but write to the
same user; the recipient does not respond.
People instantly think of spammers for motif 1 and celebrities for
motif 2. As we have not excluded comments suspected to be from
automated scripts in the construction of our activity network, the
prevalence of motif 1 is easily understood. Celebrities physically
cannot communicate with a large number of their fans, and there is
no need for their fans to know each other. Thus much contribution
to motif 2.
Another point to note about the motif distribution in the activity
network is self-posts. We remind you that self-posts take up 38.9%
of all posts.
If disambiguated, self-posts add a directed edge to
a motif, if the edge is not already present. In general, self-posts
will decrease the proportion of intransitive motifs, and raise the Z-
scores of transitive motifs, once disambiguated.
The monthly window for the activity incurs boundary effects for
interaction at the beginning and the end of the month. Most users’
posts are spaced at one day or shorter apart as we see in Figure 15
of Section 5.2 and we conclude the boundary effects are negligible.
In summary the network motif analysis of the activity network
demonstrates that the online interaction through the Cyworld guest-
book feature follows other social networks [29] closely, but mas-
sive one-way communication suspected to be from spammers and
celebrities distort the Z-scores for motifs 1 and 2. In spite of the
explosive growth during the period, the Z-score distributions of
the network motifs have consistently shown the most proximity to
those from previously analyzed social networks.

4.3 Network Motifs
In Sections 4.1 and 4.2 we have conducted a macroscopic anal-
ysis of the activity network and seen that interaction is highly re-
ciprocal, but not evenly spread amongst friends. In this section we
delve deeper to the interaction patterns among users and their evo-
lution.
The basis of group interaction begins with three people. There
are 13 possible patterns of directional interaction among three peo-
ple, and they are called network motifs. Milo et al. have proposed
a network-motif-based categorization of networks [29]. The main
idea is to calculate the proportions of 13 network motifs in the net-
work of interest, and compare them against random graphs. We
can group networks of similar nature based on the prevalence or
scarcity of a certain subset of motifs relative to the random graphs.
The Z-score of a motif represents its proportion in a network. It
is calculated as follows:
Zi =
Nreal,i − m(Nrandom,i)
σrandom,i
,
(6)
where Nreal,i is the number of motif i in the network of our inter-
est, and m(Nrandom,i) and σrandom,i are the mean and the stan-
dard deviation of motif i in random graphs, respectively. The Z-
score as in (6) is not normalized and grows with the network size.
We normalize Z scores by
X
Zi/(
Zi
2)0.5
(7)
as in [28] and remove the bias. The motif deﬁnitions and Z-scores
we use here do not take the edge weight into consideration. Thus
motifs in this section capture the interaction patterns, not the fre-
quency or intensity of the interaction.
We conduct our motif analysis using FANMOD, a network motif
detection tool developed by Wernicke and Rasche citewernicke06.
In contrast to previous work that focuses on static snapshots of net-
works [1, 28, 29, 36] and infer evolutionary paths, we take snap-
shots from different periods and compare the evolution in motif
composition. Instead of building a single activity network from the
two-year-long guestbook logs, we build the activity network by the
month. More speciﬁcally, we choose ﬁve representative months,
July 2003, January, April, June 2004, and January 2005, and count
the motifs in them. FANMOD takes as input the in-degree and out-
degree distributions of the target network and the number of ran-
dom networks. We use 100 random networks for the ﬁrst 4 activ-
5. OTHER ACTIVITY-RELATED ASPECTS
Here we investigate two other activity-related aspects, namely,
capacity cap and time intervals. We examine whether the number
of messages a user writes increases with the number of friends the
user has online. The number cannot increase indeﬁnitely and is
bound to fall off at some point. The fall-off point speaks for the
innate upper bound on human capacity of guestbook-like online
social interaction. The next topic we look at is the time intervals
between messages sent. The online social network services are a
rather new phenomenon and not much is known about human be-
haviors on those services. The time interval analysis should provide
a macroscopic understanding on the frequency of service usage.
5.1 Capacity Cap
We ﬁrst ask the following question: “Are people socially more
active, if they have many friends?” We would like to know if one’s
number of friends plays an encouraging role, as the more friends
have joined the same online social networking service, the more
peer pressure one might receive.
of languages and the corresponding development in human brain
in the evolutionary path. Dunbar’s law extrapolates a limit on the
number of manageable relationships by the species based on its
neocortex size and “the limit imposed by neocortical processing
capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a sta-
ble inter-personal relationship can be maintained." [12].
As a recent news article points out [8], the technology-assisted
social network size is fundamentally intriguing as it challenges our
innate capacity for social grooming. Figure 14 tells one of the ﬁrst
evidences that people respond to comments and manage a social
network size up to 200 online. Whether they manage off-line con-
tact with these 200 friends or not is beyond the scope of this work.
The young generation are more at ease and faster in adopting new
technologies. Correlation between the group size and the age might
reveal the generational gap quantitatively. Also the microscopic
analysis of intra- and inter-group dynamics would provide baseline
facts about online socializing behaviors. We leave these questions
for future work.
5.2 Time Interval
Daily visitors to the site probably write and visit more guest-
books than infrequent visitors. The time interval between visits
tells much about the inherent underlying cognitive behavior as well
as patterns of induced trafﬁc for network engineering purposes. In
this section we analyze the time intervals between consecutive mes-
sages written by one user.
The call arrival process in the telephone network has long been
known to follow the Poisson distribution. With the advent of the
Internet and new killer applications, the arrival process of new traf-
ﬁc type requires close examination for any change in the underly-
ing stochastic nature. Arrival patterns of HTTP requests at a web
server are critical to monitoring and management of the system
performance and quality-of-service. Crovella and Bestavros have
published one of the ﬁrst work on world-wide web trafﬁc [9]. They
have shown that the distribution of HTTP request arrivals and trans-
mission times follow heavy-tail. Much work on trafﬁc modeling
followed, mostly from trafﬁc log mining.
Figure 15 shows time intervals between two consecutive guest-
book messages by users. In contrast to earlier sections, we include
self-posts, because they are relevant user activity and we need not
identify the recipients. We can divide the time interval distribu-
tion into three regions: x  1 day. All the three regions follow power-law, while the third
region has an undulating pattern with daily peaks.
Figure 15: Time intervals between guestbook comments
Figure 14: Median node strength vs number of friends
In Figure 14 we plot the median node strength against the num-
ber of friends per user. We see that the number of friends does in-
ﬂuence the node strength up to users with about 200 friends. That
is, people with up to 200 friends respond to peer pressure to stay
active online. Then the node strength starts to decrease, even when
the number of friends keeps increasing. The Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient of the overall graph in Figure 14 is 0.2071. We split the
users into two separate groups, those with 200 or fewer friends and
with more than 200, and compute the correlation coefﬁcients. For
the ﬁrst group, the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is 0.6235, that
is, strongly positive; for the other group, only 0.00913. Intuitively,
the more friends one has, the more active one should be socially.
However, beyond 200 or so friends, one must reach a limit in one’s
socializing capacity. We have plotted the number of messages with-
out self-posts against the node degree, and have observed the same
cut-off at 200. In order to reﬂect the sparsity of data points beyond
the degree of 200, we have used different bin sizes for x > 200.
Still, we see a clear cut-off at x = 200.
This striking behavior is in agreement with the previous work
that reports a fall-out from a single scaling behavior in the node de-
gree distribution [2]. We have conjectured the emergence of online-
only relationships for the multi-scaling behavior in the degree dis-
tribution and referred to Dunbar’s number of 150 for a plausible
explanation [13]. Dunbar bases his work on the analysis of the role
The ﬁrst region (x < 36 min) maps to comments written at a
very short time interval of 36 minutes or shorter. The ﬁrst data
point on the y-axis is from when x = 1 min. Writing a com-
ment within a minute or less after the previous comment is some-
what not humanly, although writing quick, short messages, such as
“Okay!” or “Hey!”, is not unheard of. Golder et al. have used
5 seconds as the threshold of inter-message time for automatically
generated messages and manual ones [18]. They report 43% of
the collected Facebook messages to be spam. The time granular-
ity in our guestbook logs is in minutes, and we cannot verify their
choice of the threshold. However, we can extrapolate from Fig-
ure 15 that the amount of spam classiﬁed with their threshold value
is likely to be far smaller.
In the Microsoft Messenger network
analysis, Leskovec and Horvitz have presented the power-law ex-
ponent of 1.5 of time interval distributions between consecutive
conversations started by one user [27]. Barabasi points out that
human beings receive tasks and execute them in two separate pro-
cesses, and has built a model for the task execution intervals for
variable-length tasks with the power-law exponent of 1.5 [6].
The power-law exponent from our data is slightly larger than
from the other two. Though the Cyworld guestbook has no up-
per limit on the number of characters per entry, most entries are
terse enough to be viewed without scrolling down. We believe
the ﬁnite nature of the guestbook entries contribute to the slightly
larger power-law exponent. However, we do not have data about
the length of messages, and cannot conﬁrm our proposition.
The power-law exponent for the second region (36 minutes <
x < 1 day) comes out to be 0.910.
If the ﬁrst region maps to
intra-session intervals, this region is representative of inter-session
intervals in a day. In [6] Barabasi begins with a simple model for
human task execution and veriﬁes his model with email data. The
time intervals between consecutive emails have the power-law dis-
tribution with an exponent of α = 1. As we expect people to write
more emails a day than logging in multiple times to Cyworld a day,
the gap between Barabasi’s exponent of 1 and ours of 0.910 from
(36 minutes < x < 1 day) is acceptable.
The time intervals beyond a day maps to login intervals. The
undulating pattern with daily peaks is the same as in literature [18,
27]. Temporal synchronization across days is possibly due to users
logging in during regular breaks from school and work and in the
