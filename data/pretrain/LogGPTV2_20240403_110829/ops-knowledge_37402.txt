Question: "Imagine you are a security engineer tasked with explaining to a development team the data protection mechanisms used by Apple devices. You need to explain how file encryption keys are managed and how different classes of data protection affect access to encrypted data after the user locks their device. Which of the following statements correctly describe these mechanisms?"
 "A": "Class A encrypts each file with a unique key, which is wrapped with a class key derived from the user's passcode and the device UID. Once the device is locked, the decrypted class key is discarded, making the data inaccessible."
 "B": "Class B allows files to be written while the device is locked by using symmetric encryption with a static key stored in the device's non-volatile memory."
 "C": "Class C behaves similarly to Class A but does not discard the decrypted class key when the device is locked, allowing data to be accessible after the first user authentication."
 "D": "Class D provides no protection and stores file encryption keys as plain text within the file's metadata for ease of access."
