ABSTRACT
The focus of this demonstration is the performance of stream-
ing video over the mobile wireless channel. We compare two
schemes: the standard approach to video which transmits
H.264/AVC-encoded stream over 802.11-like PHY, and Soft-
Cast – a clean-slate design for wireless video where the source
transmits one video stream that each receiver decodes to a
video quality commensurate with its speciﬁc instantaneous
channel quality.

INTRODUCTION
Mobile video broadcast presents a signiﬁcant challenge
to conventional wireless design. With mobility, the chan-
nel quality can exhibit fast unpredictable variations [3,9].
Video codecs however operate over groups of pictures (GOP)
and hence cannot instantaneously adapt the video rate to
the channel bit rate. As a result, a mobile receiver suﬀers
from video glitches and stales [2]. With multicast, diﬀerent
receivers experience diﬀerent channel qualities (SNRs) and
hence support diﬀerent bit rates. The transmitter however
has to pick a single transmission bit rate. As a result, the
transmitter has to send at the lowest bit rate supported by
all multicast receivers, which reduces everyone to the video
quality of the worst multicast receiver.
This demo advocates SoftCast, an alternative design for
wireless video streaming. SoftCast uses a novel encoding tech-
nique that allows it to broadcast a single stream from which
each receiver can decode a video quality commensurate with
its instantaneous channel quality. Thus, a mobile receiver need
not suﬀer glitches and stales due to quickly varying channel
quality; the received video quality naturally adapts to the
channel quality without any eﬀort from the source. Further-
more, diﬀerent multicast receivers can be served with a single
video broadcast, without reducing all receivers to the video
rate supported by the worst receiver in the group. Moreover,
SoftCast can support this performance without any receiver
feedback.
SoftCast adopts a uniﬁed design for video compression and
transmission over the wireless physical layer. SoftCast starts
with video that is represented as a sequence of numbers, with
each number representing a pixel luminance. Taking an end-
to-end perspective, it then performs a sequence of transforma-

tions to obtain the ﬁnal signal samples that are transmitted
on the channel. The crucial property of SoftCast is that each
transformation is linear. This property ensures that the sig-
nal samples transmitted on the channel are linearly related to
the original pixel values. Thus, increasing channel noise pro-
gressively perturbs the transmitted bits in proportion to their
signiﬁcance for the video application, i.e., high-quality chan-
nels perturb only the least signiﬁcant bits while low-quality
channels still preserve the most signiﬁcant bits. Each receiver
therefore decodes the received signal into video whose qual-
ity is proportional to the quality of its speciﬁc instantaneous
channel.
We have presented a preliminary design of SoftCast in [6].
Since then, we have enhanced SoftCast to perform inter-frame
compression which allows it to exploit the correlation between
subsequent frames in addition to the correlation of pixels in
each individual frame. The new design also includes packet
erasure protection and is reﬁned to work with actual OFDM
PHY (e.g., as provided by GNURadio [5]).
2. DEMONSTRATION
This demo shows live video streaming to mobile USRP soft-
ware radio nodes. The demo shows the video performance
of two schemes: SoftCast and the existing design which uses
H.264/AVC (i.e., MPEG-4 part 10) over 802.11a/g PHY. In
the experiment, a video sequence is streamed over the wire-
less channel to one or two mobile receivers. The spectators can
freely move the nodes around and observe the live video feed
on the laptop screen and how the channel conditions aﬀect
perceptible video quality.
The compared schemes share the low-level OFDM PHY
implemented in GNURadio [5] as well as the USRP2 hard-
ware, as shown in Fig. 1, thus experiencing identical channel
conditions. This includes parameters such as: channel band-
width and airtime, transmission power and receiver noise. The
channel attenuation and fading is out of direct control, but
can be inﬂuenced by changing node location (distance from
the transmitter, walls, etc.).
We have implemented real-time SoftCast using the ATLAS

Figure 2 Approaches to Wireless Video: Fig. (a) plots the space of video qualities obtained with the conventional design
which uses MPEG-4 over 802.11. Each line refers to a choice of transmission bit rate (i.e., modulation and FEC). Fig. (a)
shows that for any choice of bit rate, the conventional design experiences a performance cliﬀ. Fig. (b) plots 2-layer video in
red and 3-layer video in blue. For reference, the dashed lines are the three equivalent single-layer MPEG-4 videos. The ﬁgure
shows that layered video makes the cliﬀs milder but each new layer introduces overhead and reduces the maximum video
quality. Fig. (c) shows SoftCast (in black) and single-layer MPEG-4. It shows that SoftCast video quality scales with channel
quality.
linear algebra package [1]. SoftCast encodes the video from
pixels directly into OFDM frequency bin samples. H.264 im-
plementation is provided by libx264 [11]. The H.264-encoded
bitstream is then using 802.11 FEC, developed with Spiral [8],
and modulated using GNURadio signal processing blocks.
The experiment shows that SoftCast’s performance is ro-
bust to unpredictable channel conditions in mobile scenarios
and scales gracefully with multiple receivers. Each receiver
observes video quality commensurate with its instantaneous
channel quality, without glitches or stales. This adaptation
happens naturally in response to the noise (or interference)
level in received signal, and neither requires receiver feedback
nor sender adaptation.
3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Fig. 2 graphically displays the characteristics of the dif-
ferent video encoding and transmission schemes. This ﬁgure
presents three graphs; each graph plots the video quality at
the receiver as a function of the channel quality. All schemes
use exactly the same transmission power and the same chan-
nel bandwidth over the same period of time.
Fig. 2(a) illustrates the realizable space of video qualities
for conventional MPEG-based approaches. Each line refers to
a particular choice of transmission bit rate, i.e., a particu-
lar choice of forward error correction code and a modulation
scheme. The video codec encodes the video at the same rate
as the channel transmission bit rate. The eﬀective compres-
sion ratio of the video codec changes from 33(cid:2) at the lowest
rate to 3:7(cid:2) at the highest rate. Fig. 2(a) shows that for any
selection of transmission bit rate (i.e., modulation and FEC)
the conventional design experiences a performance cliﬀ, that
is there is a critical SNR, below which the video is not watch-
able, and above that SNR the video quality does not improve
with improvements in channel quality.
Fig. 2(b) illustrates the video qualities obtained by layered
video coding. The video is encoded using the JSVM reference
implementation for scalable video coding (SVC) [7]. The phys-
ical layer transmits the video using hierarchical modulation
over OFDM, an inner convolutional code and an outer Reed-
Solomon code following the recommendations in [4]. The ﬁg-
ure shows two solid lines, the red line encodes the video into
two layers while the blue line encodes the video into three
layers. For reference, the ﬁgure also shows in dashed lines the
single layer MPEG-4 videos that span the range of channel
SNRs spanned by the layers in the layered video. The ﬁgure
shows that layered video transforms the performance cliﬀ of
the conventional design to a few milder cliﬀs. Layering how-
ever causes extra overhead [10] and thus increases the size of
the video. Given a particular bit rate budget, the video codec
has to reduce the quality of the layered video in comparison
with the single layer video to ensure that the videos have the
same size and can be streamed at the same bit rate. As a
result, the enhancement layer of the 3-layer video has a lower
quality than the corresponding layer in 2-layer video, which
has a lower quality than the corresponding single layer video.
Fig. 2(c) illustrates the video qualities obtained with Soft-
Cast. Since SoftCast maps pixels to channel samples in the
real ﬁeld, it has no notion of bit rate. Unlike the conven-
tional or layered design, where the channel noise determines
the maximum reliable (layer) bit rate, in SoftCast it directly
translates to distortion in the video pixels. Therefore Soft-
Cast’s video quality is proportional to the channel quality and
stays competitive with the envelope of all of MPEG curves.
