User: I have already created a 64-bit program for windows using cx freeze on a 64-bit machine. I am using Windows 7 64-bit Home premium. py2exe is not working because as i understand it does not work with python 3.2.2 yet. Is there an option i have to specify in cx freeze to compile in 32-bit instead of 64-bit.
Thanks!
Assistant: All the "produce an executable from Python code" methods I know of basically create a file that bundles up the Python interpreter with the Python code you want to execute inside a single file. It is nothing at all like compiling C code to an executable; Python is just about impossible to compile to machine code in any significantly more useful way than just gluing the Python bytecode to the machine code for a Python interpreter.
So that's almost certainly why you can't produce a 32 bit exe from a 64 bit installation of Python; there isn't a 32 bit interpreter to embed in the output file.
