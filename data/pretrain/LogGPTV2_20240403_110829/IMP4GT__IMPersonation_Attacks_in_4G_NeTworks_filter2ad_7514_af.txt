Degabriele et al. showed that the use of encryption-only mode
with no integrity protection is vulnerable to decryption [13].
For the proposed attack, the authors also exploit the ICMP
refection mechanism along with IPSec speciﬁc padding and
are able to extract the plaintext. In contrast to our work, the
authors focus on IPsec and perform a ciphertext-only attack.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Mutual authentication is one central and key security aim of
LTE and is the basis for authorization, accounting, and lawful
interception. In LTE, a provably secure AKA establishes mu-
tual authentication and subsequent security mechanism ensure
the conﬁdentially of data. However, recent studies revealed
that
the
manipulation of user data.
the security mechanism does not protect against
In this paper, we presented the novel
IMP4GT attacks
that completely break the mutual authentication aim on the
user plane. More speciﬁcally, IMP4GT allows an active radio
attacker to establish arbitrary TCP/IP connections to and from
the Internet through the victim’s UE. IMP4GT exploits the lack
of integrity protection along with ICMP reﬂection mechanisms.
As a result, the attacker can circumvent any authorization,
13
accounting, or ﬁrewall mechanism of the provider. We perform
experiments to verify our assumptions and demonstrate the
real-world feasibility of IMP4GT in a realistic setup. As a re-
sult, we can access a service site that should only be accessible
by the user or circumvent the provider’s ﬁrewall. The lack of
integrity protection can break mutual authentication which is
one fundamental security aim of LTE. Considering this fact,
we demand to specify effective countermeasures for LTE and
mandatory user-plane integrity protection for 5G.
