User: Please introduce the concepts of relative paths and absolute paths, and explain their differences and usage scenarios in detail.
Assistant: Relative path and absolute path refer to the way used to describe the location of a file or directory in the file system in the computer. The relative path is based on the current working directory and describes the location relationship of the directory or file under the current working directory. For example, in a Windows system, if the current working directory is C:\project\, the relative path "..\folder\file.txt" indicates the file.txt file under the folder folder in the upper directory. An absolute path is a path that describes the full location of a directory or file in the file system, starting from the root of the file system. For example, in a Windows system, the absolute path "C:\project\folder\file.txt" indicates the file.txt file under the folder folder under the project folder on the C drive. The main differences between relative paths and absolute paths are: 1. A relative path describes the location of a file or directory relative to the location of the current working directory, while an absolute path describes the location of a file or directory starting from the root directory of the file system. 2. A relative path can simplify the path, while an absolute path can accurately specify the complete location of a file or directory. Usage scenarios: Relative paths are often used to refer to files or directories in the same project, or when the same resource is shared in multiple environments, relative paths can be used appropriately to avoid long paths and improve code readability. Absolute paths are often used to access files or directories across file systems or across networks. Absolute paths are best when you need to ensure the complete location of a file or directory.
