formation may be because of acoustic events that are heard

The existence of such partial information has the eﬀect
that the ﬁngerprints FCd1
and FCA share common bits at-
tributable to this partial information. The eﬀect of the par-
tial information is signiﬁcant. If one looks at the bit simi-
larities of adversarial devices to the co-located ones, we can
see that the attacker devices share ca. 65 - 85 % of common
bits, depending on the placement of the attacker devices.

Consider as an example 360-bit ﬁngerprints corresponding

i.e., t(cid:48) = 54 bits. Assume also that the fuzzy commitment
scheme corrects up to 10 % of bit diﬀerences, i.e., t = 36

Note
that the length of the used ﬁngerprints can be freely chosen
depending on the security requirements of a speciﬁc use case.
The only limiting factor is the time required to acquire the
context measurements for generating the ﬁngerprints.
Some of the changes in d1’s ambient context, especially in
the ambient luminosity, can originate from environmental
changes that can also be observable by the attacker A in a
close-by room (e.g., if direct sunlight is suddenly obscured
by a cloud). A could utilize this information to give more
conﬁdence to bits b in its ﬁngerprint FCA that A knows to
originate from such environmental events. Thus, he could
limit the search space of bit positions to be ﬂipped to fab-
CA , thus decreasing the eﬀective length |FC| of the
ricate F (cid:48)
ﬁngerprint in Eq. 5 and thereby improving his chances for
success. However, in our attacker model, A is an oﬀ-the-shelf
IoT device, and does in general not have the technology to
interpret the causes behind changes in sensor readings in an
automated way. Therefore it wouldn’t be straightforward
for A to distinguish which changes in the sensor readings
are caused by such changes in the environment that are ob-
servable also in d1’s context and which are not. On the other
hand, should such technology become available in the future,
it could not only be used by A to improve its guesses, but
also by d1 to defend against guessing. While generating its
ﬁngerprint, d1 could keep track of the number of ﬁngerprint
bits b ∈ FCd1
that were inﬂuenced by changes in the envi-
ronment outside of its proximate context. The target device
d1 could then disregard such key evolution steps, for which
the number of inﬂuenced ﬁngerprint bits is too high.
6. RELATED WORK
There are various approaches proposed to establish a se-
cure pairing between devices. These approaches can be
broadly divided into two main categories: utilizing key pre-
distribution mainly addressing nodes in digital sensor net-
works (DSN), and utilizing context information for key es-
tablishment or co-presence veriﬁcation.
Key predistribution-based approaches. A scheme for
key distribution in DSNs based on predistributing keys to
nodes was presented by Eschenauer and Gligor [6]. Their
scheme ensured that when deployed, each sensor node shares
a key with a neighboring node. Chan et al. [2] extend this
basic scheme and design three enhanced key pre-distribution
schemes: the q-composite scheme, multipath reinforcement
scheme, and, random pairwise key predistribution scheme.
Liu et al. [10] propose key predistribution schemes based on
preassignment of polynomial shares to sensor network nodes:
a random subset assignment scheme and a hypercube-based
key predistribution scheme.
Traynor et al. [18] extend the key predistribution schemes
by removing the assumption of homogeneous sensor nodes
and key predistribution by introducing unbalanced proba-
bilistic key distribution. They also extend their approach
to hybrid settings in which key distribution centers (KDC)
may be available.
However, all of the above schemes are mainly targeted at
DSNs deployed in a geographically limited area. Hence they
are as such not applicable nor scalable in practice to our
setting, which involves arbitrary subsets of devices coming
from a pool of potentially millions of IoT and wearable de-
vices deployed anywhere on the planet. Also, in contrast to
DSNs that typically are deployed by a single or a few organi-
zations sharing trust associations, IoT and wearable devices
are expected to come from hundreds if not thousands of dif-
ferent manufacturers. It is highly unlikely that all potential
IoT and wearable device vendors would share mutual secu-
rity associations necessary for pre-keying of devices. These
factors make any solutions based on predistributing keys be-
tween devices infeasible to deploy in practice.
Therefore, our approach presented in this paper does not
utilize key predistribution to devices, but builds on utilizing
ambient context information for evolving a pairing key be-
tween devices consistently sharing the same context.
Context information-based approaches. Varshavsky et
al. [20] proposed to use the ﬂuctuations in the received signal
strength of WiFi broadcast packets for verifying the immedi-
ate proximity of the to-be-paired parties. This approach is,
however not suitable for IoT scenarios: it is unlikely to work
in situations in which peers are located farther away from
each other than one meter, due to the local nature of the
ﬂuctuations in WiFi signals. The authors also acknowledge
that it does not protect against man-in-the middle attacks
that are mounted by an attacker immediately behind a wall
to the user’s location, since WiFi signals are unaﬀected by
some wall materials.
Narayanan et al. [11] propose a similar approach, in which
WiFi broadcast packets are monitored to determine location
tags that peers can compare to determine whether they are
co-located or not. Their solution addresses, however, the
problem of privacy-preserving determination of co-location
and does not address the problem of pairing previously un-
known peers with each other, whereas we explicitly address
the problem of pairing personal devices.
Sch¨urmann and Sigg [16] propose to use audio for generat-
ing a shared secret between co-located peers to be used as a
pairing key. They record audio samples and calculate audio
ﬁngerprints based on them. Using Reed-Solomon encoding
for fuzzy extraction of a common key they show that in
various audio environments, cryptographic keys can be de-
rived from the surrounding audio context. Their approach
attempts to extract a large amount of entropy from a short
audio snapshot and requires therefore very exact temporal
alignment of the sound samples, which is diﬃcult to achieve
with oﬀ-the shelf devices. Our approach is diﬀerent, since
our method does not require exact temporal alignment, and
it operates on longitudinal data, extracting entropy from the
user’s context over a longer period of time. Contrary to the
approaches in [20, 11, 16], our approach can also handle sit-
uations in which an adversary is present in the correct peers’
context without breaking the authenticity of the pairing.
The problem of zero-interaction authentication utilizing
contextual proofs of presence has been discussed by Truong
et al. [19]. While their work also addresses a zero-interaction
scenario, their problem is diﬀerent: they consider the prob-
lem of co-location veriﬁcation using context information in
a setting, in which both endpoints are trusted and already
have an established security association, whereas our ap-
proach addresses the problem of pairing devices that do not
have any prior security associations with each other.
7. CONCLUSION
We have presented a novel key evolution approach for pair-
ing personal IoT and wearable devices. The approach builds
on a robust scheme for extracting shared entropy from the
ambient context of such devices. We have also evaluated the
approach based on experiments with luminosity and ambient
noise in a number of diﬀerent environments. These results
should be understood as indicative, primarily establishing
the overall feasibility of our proposed approach. Currently
we are working on more large-scale testing in diﬀerent sce-
narios and diﬀerent contexts, which we think is of impor-
tance for further research in this area.
