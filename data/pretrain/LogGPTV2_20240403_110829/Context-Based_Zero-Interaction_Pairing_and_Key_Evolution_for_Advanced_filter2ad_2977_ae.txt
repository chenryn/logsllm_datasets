### Partial Information and Its Impact on Fingerprint Similarity

In the context of luminosity, the presence of outdoor light can influence the lighting conditions in both the target device \(d_1\) and the attacker \(A\). For audio, partial information may be due to acoustic events that are audible in both contexts.

The existence of such partial information results in common bits between the fingerprints \(F_{C_{d1}}\) and \(F_{CA}\), attributable to this shared information. The impact of partial information is significant. When comparing the bit similarities of adversarial devices to co-located ones, we observe that attacker devices share approximately 65-85% of common bits, depending on their placement.

This partial information benefits the attacker. If \(A\) assumes that its fingerprint \(F_{CA}\) contains partial information about the target device \(d_1\)'s fingerprint \(F_{C_{d1}}\), \(A\) can use \(F_{CA}\) as a basis for fabricating a fake fingerprint \(F'_{CA}\). Let \(t'\) denote the bit difference between \(A\)'s fingerprint \(F_{CA}\) and the target fingerprint \(F_{C_{d1}}\). Then, \(A\) needs to guess only \(\Delta t = t' - t\) bit modifications to \(F_{CA}\) to create a fake fingerprint \(F'_{CA}\) such that \(\text{Ham}(F_{C_{d1}}, F'_{CA}) \leq t\), allowing \(A\) to participate successfully in the key evolution.

Since \(A\) does not know which bits in \(F_{CA}\) differ from \(F_{C_{d1}}\), \(A\) must guess a set of at least \(\Delta t\) bit positions to correct in \(F_{CA}\) to achieve \(\text{Ham}(F_{C_{d1}}, F'_{CA}) \leq t\). The probability of selecting \(\Delta t\) bits from the total set of \(t'\) differing bits is given by:

\[
P(\Delta t \text{ successful corrections}) = \frac{\binom{t'}{\Delta t}}{\binom{|FC|}{\Delta t}}
\]

where \(|FC|\) denotes the bit length of the used fingerprints.

**Example:**
Consider 360-bit fingerprints corresponding to 6 hours of 1-minute observations. Assume \(A\) has a fingerprint \(F_{CA}\) with a bit difference of 15%, i.e., \(t' = 54\) bits. Assume also that the fuzzy commitment scheme corrects up to 10% of bit differences, i.e., \(t = 36\) bits. To guess a fingerprint \(F'_{CA}\) with \(\text{Ham}(F_{C_{d1}}, F'_{CA}) \leq 36\), \(A\) would need to correct \(\Delta t = 18\) bits. The success probability for \(A\) is calculated as:

\[
P(18 \text{ successful corrections}) = \frac{\binom{54}{18}}{\binom{360}{18}} \approx 9.27 \times 10^{-17}
\]

This probability is equivalent to approximately 53 bits of entropy, indicating that guessing correct fingerprints will be extremely difficult for the attacker if the fingerprints are long enough. Note that the length of the fingerprints can be freely chosen based on the security requirements of a specific use case. The limiting factor is the time required to acquire the context measurements for generating the fingerprints.

### Environmental Changes and Their Influence

Some changes in \(d_1\)'s ambient context, particularly in luminosity, can originate from environmental changes observable by the attacker \(A\) in a nearby room (e.g., if direct sunlight is suddenly obscured by a cloud). \(A\) could use this information to give more confidence to bits in its fingerprint \(F_{CA}\) that it knows to originate from such environmental events. This would limit the search space of bit positions to be flipped, effectively reducing the length \(|FC|\) of the fingerprint and improving \(A\)'s chances of success.

However, in our attacker model, \(A\) is an off-the-shelf IoT device and generally lacks the technology to interpret the causes behind changes in sensor readings automatically. Therefore, it would not be straightforward for \(A\) to distinguish which changes in the sensor readings are caused by environmental factors observable in \(d_1\)'s context and which are not. Should such technology become available in the future, it could be used by both \(A\) to improve its guesses and \(d_1\) to defend against guessing. While generating its fingerprint, \(d_1\) could track the number of fingerprint bits influenced by changes in the environment outside its proximate context and disregard key evolution steps where the number of influenced bits is too high.

### Related Work

Various approaches have been proposed to establish secure pairing between devices, broadly divided into two categories: key pre-distribution and context-based key establishment or co-presence verification.

**Key Pre-distribution Approaches:**
- Eschenauer and Gligor [6] presented a key distribution scheme for DSNs, ensuring each sensor node shares a key with a neighboring node.
- Chan et al. [2] extended this scheme with three enhanced key pre-distribution schemes.
- Liu et al. [10] proposed key pre-distribution schemes based on polynomial shares.
- Traynor et al. [18] introduced unbalanced probabilistic key distribution, extending their approach to hybrid settings with key distribution centers (KDC).

However, these schemes are primarily targeted at DSNs deployed in geographically limited areas and are not scalable or applicable to scenarios involving arbitrary subsets of devices from a pool of potentially millions of IoT and wearable devices. Additionally, the lack of mutual security associations among different manufacturers makes key pre-distribution infeasible.

**Context-Based Approaches:**
- Varshavsky et al. [20] used WiFi signal strength fluctuations for proximity verification, but this approach is unsuitable for IoT scenarios and vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Narayanan et al. [11] monitored WiFi broadcast packets to determine location tags, addressing privacy-preserving co-location but not pairing.
- Schürmann and Sigg [16] used audio for generating shared secrets, requiring exact temporal alignment, which is challenging with off-the-shelf devices.
- Truong et al. [19] discussed zero-interaction authentication using contextual proofs of presence, but their problem involves trusted endpoints with established security associations.

### Conclusion

We have presented a novel key evolution approach for pairing personal IoT and wearable devices, leveraging shared entropy from the ambient context. Our approach has been evaluated through experiments with luminosity and ambient noise in various environments, demonstrating its feasibility. Further large-scale testing in different scenarios and contexts is ongoing.
