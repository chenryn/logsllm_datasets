User: I have run into an issue with spark-submit , throws an error is not a Jupyter Command i.e, pyspark launches a web ui instead of pyspark shell 
Background info:

Installed Scala , Spark using brew on MAC
Installed Conda Python 3.5
Spark commands work on Jupyter Notebook
'pyspark' on terminal launches notebook instead of shell

Any help is much appreciated.
Assistant: The PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON variable is set to start ipython/jupyter automatically (probably as intended.)  Run unset PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON and then try pyspark again.
If you wish this to be the default, you'll probably need to modify your profile scripts.
