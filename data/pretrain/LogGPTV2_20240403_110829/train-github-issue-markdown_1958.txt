As discussed in #11332
  1. `renderer.gammaInput` needs to be deprecated. We now support `texture.encoding` instead.
  2. renderer.gammaOutput needs to be deprecated and replaced with `renderer.outputEncoding` when rendering to the screen. We already support `renderTarget.texture.encoding` when rendering to a render target.
  3. WebGLPrograms.getProgramCode() needs to be updated to respond to changes in `renderer.outputEncoding`. Setting `material.needsUpdate = true` will then force the change.
  4. Legacy warnings need to be added, and the examples need to be updated to accommodate this change.
