Sorry for the screenshot and not text, but I can't copy
# Steps to reproduce
Connect to windows from a mac with Microsoft Remote Desktop and the "Use Mac
Shortcuts for Cut, Copy, and Paste" option on.
# Expected behavior
Command-c copy, command-v paste. This does work in just powershell, but not in
the new Terminal
# Actual behavior
It sends `^C` and `^V`
