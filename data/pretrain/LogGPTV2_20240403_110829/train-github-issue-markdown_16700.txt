With IoT, WebRTC and VoIP DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) is becoming
more and more important.
It would be great if the Go standard libray has support for it like it has for
TLS.  
It would allow to implement secure versions of protocols using UDP as the
underlying protocol like CoAP for example.
