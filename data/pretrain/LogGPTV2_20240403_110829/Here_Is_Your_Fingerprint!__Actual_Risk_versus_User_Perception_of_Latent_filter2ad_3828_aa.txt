## Abstract
The small touch sensors in smartphones can only capture a limited portion of a full fingerprint, making them vulnerable to spoofing attacks that exploit a user's firm fingerprint impression. However, it remains unclear whether the smudges left on the smartphone surface during daily use can be used to bypass these sensors. In this paper, we first investigate how to exploit the latent fingerprints and smudges left on the smartphone surface. We introduce the "Fingerprint SCRAP" attack, which reconstructs high-quality images of enrolled fingerprints using smudges from the home button and touch screen. We conduct an experimental study to evaluate the actual risk posed by this attack. We collected 403 latent fingerprints from seven users under six different conditions (tapping, passcode-typing, text-typing, Facebook usage, in-pocket, and wiping). Using these, we performed our attack and compared the results with firmly impressed fingerprints. Our findings indicate that the SCRAP attack poses a significant risk to small touch sensors. We also examine the gap between user behavior and their perception of risk. An in-person survey of 82 participants revealed that the fingers most frequently used on the touch screen and home button are the same, and users' risk perception is generally low. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation methods and future research directions.

## 1. Introduction
Fingerprint recognition has become widely adopted in smartphones for device unlocking and convenient authentication services such as FIDO (Fast ID Online) and mobile payments [18]. For example, Apple's Touch ID, a small capacitive touch sensor, allows users to unlock their devices, make online purchases, and authenticate Apple Pay with a simple press of the home button. However, there is a security concern: small touch sensors can only capture a partial, limited portion of the full fingerprint without a liveness check, making them more susceptible to false matches due to entropy loss [15, 35].

Numerous practical, often non-professional, studies have demonstrated how to spoof fingerprints and deceive small fingerprint sensors using common materials like PVA glue, gelatin, and conductive ink [1, 6, 22, 24, 33, 34, 39]. These threats are limited because they require the target user's cooperation to provide a firm fingerprint impression. However, some studies have shown that if a high-quality image of a user's fingerprint is obtained, it can be used to bypass the small fingerprint sensors [1, 6, 34].

In daily use, users frequently interact with their smartphones, leaving oily residues, or "smudges," on the device surface. These smudges, though partially damaged, may still contain useful information about the user's fingerprint. Previous work has shown that smudges can be photographed and exploited to discover Android lock patterns [2]. If these smudges could also be used to reconstruct a high-quality image of the enrolled fingerprint, even a locked smartphone might be at risk. To our knowledge, no literature has explicitly addressed the threat posed by daily smudges on smartphone surfaces.

This paper aims to answer the following research questions based on strong field evidence:

- **Q1.1**: Can latent fingerprints be extracted from the smudges remaining on the smartphone surface after daily use?
- **Q1.2**: Can a high-quality image of the enrolled fingerprint be constructed from these smudges for small touch sensors?

- **Q2.1**: Are the fingers most frequently used on the home button and touch screen the same?
- **Q2.2**: Are users aware of the latent fingerprints remaining on the smartphone surface as a potential risk?

To explore these questions, we conducted a two-part study approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

## 2. Background and Related Work
### Fingerprint Recognition in Smartphones
Since the introduction of Touch ID in 2013, high-definition capacitive touch sensors have been integrated into the home buttons of smartphones, allowing users to easily unlock their devices with a fingertip [23]. Users can enroll up to five fingerprints and set a passcode as a fallback method. Internally, the passcode, combined with a factory-installed device key, decrypts the class keys that protect user data. In Touch ID, one of the enrolled fingerprints, if not failed five times, retrieves a temporary encryption key (TEK) stored in the sensor for up to 48 hours, which is used to decrypt the class keys [23]. Fingerprint templates are stored in secure hardware environments, such as Apple's Secure Enclave and Samsung's ARM TrustZone, to prevent leakage and reconstruction [18, 23]. Recent studies have shown that many touch sensor users perceive fingerprint recognition as more usable and secure than alternatives like passcodes [7, 11].

### Small Fingerprint Sensors
Table 1 shows that the touch sensors in smartphones are very small, capturing only a partial portion of the full fingerprint and extracting a reduced number of minutiae [15]. The minimum image dimension required for fingerprint capture is 12.7 × 16.5 mm (209.6 mm²) [31]. Prior works have studied the performance degradation and multiple registration issues of small sensors [15, 42, 29, 35], showing that matcher performance is significantly degraded by image cropping and multiple registrations, exposing potential vulnerabilities. Roy et al. explored the possibility of generating a "MasterPrint" composed of multiple partial fingerprints to impersonate multiple users [35]. Our study differs from these prior works as we focus on smudges and latent fingerprints on smartphones.

### Latent Fingerprints
In forensic science, numerous studies have dealt with latent fingerprints. These are accidental fingerprint impressions left on a surface, visible or invisible at the time of deposition. Various physical, chemical, and illumination methods have been studied for developing and visualizing latent fingerprints, such as powder dusting [37], visual chemical reactions [28], and laser techniques [10]. We are particularly interested in the setting of smudge attacks on smartphones [2].

Latent fingerprints are typically obtained under non-ideal conditions, requiring reconstruction and enhancement. Prior works have focused on image preprocessing techniques, such as grayscale conversion [20] and histogram equalization [19], which we incorporate into our reconstruction process.

### Smudge Attacks
In 2010, Aviv et al. first studied smudge attacks on Android unlock patterns by photographing the surface and retrieving smudge patterns [2]. They examined various lighting and camera conditions to facilitate pattern retrieval and simulated real usage scenarios. Their results showed that smudges could be exploited to guess secret patterns drawn on the touch screen. This work provides strong evidence that smudges can be used to deceive small touch sensors if a high-quality image of a partial fingerprint is obtained.

### Related Software
For semi-automation of our attack, we implemented image processing and verification software in Python using the OpenCV library [5] and NIST NBIS packages, including MINDTCT, BOZORTH3, and NFIQ [41].

Zhang et al. demonstrated fingerprint attacks against touch-enabled devices to infer user PINs or passwords from fingerprints left on the touch screen [45]. They used dusting and various image processing techniques to sharpen fingerprints, remove the background, and map the fingerprints to specific keys to infer user passwords. Our study builds on these prior works but focuses on discovering latent fingerprints and reconstructing effective images of partial fingerprints.

### Fingerprint Spoofing Attacks
Many prior works have explored spoofing fingerprints to deceive fingerprint recognition sensors, such as optical, capacitive, tactile, and thermal sensors [38]. Various materials, including glue, gelatin, latex, silicon, and thermoplastic, have been used to create artificial fingers targeting real-world fingerprint sensors [13, 16, 30]. These studies all exploited firm impressions of full fingerprints.

In 2004, Germany’s Chaos Computer Club demonstrated how to photograph a full fingerprint imprinted on a glass surface using graphite powder and exploit the image to create a fake fingerprint using wood glue [8]. In 2013, the same group showed that the same method could defeat partial fingerprint recognition in the iPhone 5S [1]. Due to the popularity and attractive small size of touch sensors, many people have attempted similar attacks. There are numerous field works on spoofing partial fingerprints, including public videos listed in Table 4 in Appendix A. Wood glue was used for direct casting of fingerprints, but these methods required the target user's cooperation, e.g., against Galaxy S5 [22] and iPhone 6 [33]. Another approach involved making molds with various materials and casting artificial fingers.

## 3. Fingerprint SCRAP Attack
We present the Fingerprint SCRAP (Smudges Collected Reconstruction And sPooﬁng) attack, using Figure 1 as an example. The SCRAP attack involves collecting latent fingerprints from smudges on the smartphone surface, using the latent fingerprint found on the home button as a key to reconstruct the enrolled fingerprint. The attack procedure includes photographic smudge collection, fingerprint smudge matching, image quality assessment, and fingerprint image construction. We verify the reconstructed image for minutiae quality, match scores, and overall image quality. Although manual photography and minute adjustments are necessary, the remaining procedures are automated. We then conduct an experimental study by recruiting participants under a privacy protection agreement. After collecting over 400 latent fingerprints from seven users in six conditions (tapping, passcode-typing, text-typing, Facebook usage, in-pocket, and wiping), we measure the quality of the constructed images compared to the firm impressions of genuine fingerprints.

## 4. Experimental Study
We conducted an experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness of the SCRAP attack. We recruited participants and collected latent fingerprints from their smartphones under various conditions. The results show that the SCRAP attack can produce high-quality fingerprint images, posing a significant risk to small touch sensors.

## 5. User Behavior and Perception Gap
We investigated users' touch behavior and their perception of the risk posed by latent fingerprints through in-person surveys and selective interviews. We surveyed 82 Apple Touch ID users, asking about their Touch ID experience, fingerprint enrollment, finger preferences on the home button and touch screen, and risk perception. We validated their answers through follow-up actions and semi-structured interviews. Our findings indicate that the fingers most frequently used on the home button and touch screen are the same, and users' risk perception is generally low.

## 6. Mitigation Methods and Future Directions
Finally, we discuss potential mitigation methods and future research directions. We propose enhancing the security of small touch sensors by incorporating additional biometric features and improving the liveness detection capabilities. Future research should focus on developing more robust and user-friendly authentication methods that can mitigate the risks associated with latent fingerprints and smudges on smartphones.
