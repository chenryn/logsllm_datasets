ABSTRACT
A small touch sensor employed in smartphones can only capture
a partial limited portion of the full (cid:128)ngerprint, and so it is more
vulnerable to (cid:128)ngerprint spoo(cid:128)ng a(cid:138)acks that leverage a user’s (cid:128)rm
impression. However, it is still unknown whether daily smudges re-
maining on the smartphone surface can be exploited to circumvent
the small touch sensor. In this paper, we (cid:128)rst study how to exploit
the (cid:128)ngerprint smudges le(cid:137) on the smartphone surface in daily
use, and present the so-called (cid:128)ngerprint SCRAP a(cid:138)ack, which
uses smudges remaining on the home bu(cid:138)on and touch screen to
reconstruct an image of the enrolled (cid:128)ngerprint in good quality. We
conduct an experimental study to show the actual risk regarding
this a(cid:138)ack. We collect 403 latent (cid:128)ngerprints from the smudges le(cid:137)
on the touch screens (361) and home bu(cid:138)ons (42) by seven users
in six conditions (tapping, passcode-typing, text-typing, facebook,
in-pocket, wiping). Using them, we perform our a(cid:138)ack and evaluate
the results in comparison with the (cid:128)rmly impressed (cid:128)ngerprints.
(cid:140)e study results indicate that our a(cid:138)ack is actual risk to the small
touch sensors. We then investigate the user’s touch behavior and
perception gap. We conduct in-person surveys involving 82 par-
ticipants, and ask about their touch behaviors and also their risk
perception regarding the latent (cid:128)ngerprints. (cid:140)e survey results
show that the (cid:128)ngers most frequently used on a touch screen and a
home bu(cid:138)on are the same, and the user’s risk perception is very
low. We (cid:128)nally discuss mitigation methods and future directions.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recently, (cid:128)ngerprint recognition has been popularly adopted to
smartphones to support prompt device unlock and convenient user
authentication services including FIDO (Fast ID Online) and mobile
payment transactions [18]. Indeed, Apple iPhone employs a small
capacitive touch sensor called Touch ID, which is covered with
laser-cut sapphire crystal on a home bu(cid:138)on. (cid:140)erefore, iPhone
users can simply press the home bu(cid:138)on to unlock the device, make
purchases in online stores, authenticate Apple Pay, and so on.
(cid:140)ere is but security concern that the small touch sensor could
capture only a partial limited portion of the full (cid:128)ngerprint without
a liveness check function — partial (cid:128)ngerprints are more prone to
generate a false match due to entropy loss [15, 35]. Indeed, plenty
of practical, mostly non-professional, (cid:128)eld works have shown how
to fake a (cid:128)ngerprint and deceive the small (cid:128)ngerprint sensors em-
ployed in smartphones by exploiting only commodity stu(cid:130)s, such
as PVA glue, gelatine, and conductive ink [1, 6, 22, 24, 33, 34, 39].
(cid:140)is kind of threat is quite limited because of requiring target user’s
cooperation — a user must have provided the (cid:128)rm impression of
the (cid:128)ngerprint to forge a partial (cid:128)ngerprint. Interestingly, however,
some of the (cid:128)eld works also showed that if the (cid:128)rm impression of
user’s (cid:128)ngerprint is photographed or scanned in good quality, such
an image can be used to circumvent the small (cid:128)ngerprint sensors
employed in smartphones [1, 6, 34].
Users, meanwhile, frequently perform various touch activities
with a few (cid:128)ngertips in daily use of their smartphones [3, 17, 43],
and so there always remain “daily smudges”, i.e., oily residues of
(cid:128)ngertips, on the smartphone surface as photographed in Figure 1.
Note that the smudges remaining on the smartphone, albeit par-
tially damaged, could be associated with the user’s (cid:128)ngerprint.
If the user uses the same (cid:128)nger enrolled for Touch ID for such
touch activities on a touch screen, the smudges may contain quite
useful information about the user’s authentic (cid:128)ngerprint. Interest-
ingly, a previous work showed that the smudges remaining on the
smartphone surface could be relatively easily photographed and
exploited to discover an Android lock pa(cid:138)ern [2]. If such smudges
could furthermore be used to discover the enrolled (cid:128)ngerprint in
good quality, even a locked smartphone might also face actual risk.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no explicit literature
that deals with daily smudges le(cid:137) on the smartphone surface, not a
cooperative (cid:128)rm impression, as a latent (cid:128)ngerprint threat.
Hence, in this paper, we raise the following research questions
based on the strong (cid:128)eld evidence mentioned above.
(Q1.1) Is it possible to extract latent (cid:128)ngerprints from the smudges
remaining on the surface of smartphones a(cid:137)er daily use?
(Q1.2) Is it possible to construct an image of the enrolled (cid:128)ngerprint
in good quality for small touch sensors from daily smudges?

(Q2.1) Are the (cid:128)ngers used most frequently by a user on the home
bu(cid:138)on and the touch screen, respectively, the same?
(Q2.2) Are the users aware of the latent (cid:128)ngerprints remaining on
the smartphone surface as actual risk?
To explore the answers to the questions above, we study the
actual risk and user perception gap regarding the latent (cid:128)ngerprints
remaining on the smartphone surface, in two folds. Our study has
been done a(cid:137)er an approval of the IRB.
We (cid:128)rst present the so-called (cid:128)ngerprint SCRAP (Smudges Col-
lected Reconstruction And sPoo(cid:128)ng) a(cid:136)ack, and use Figure 1 as an
example when describing the a(cid:138)ack procedure (Section 3). (cid:140)e
SCRAP a(cid:138)ack starts with collecting the latent (cid:128)ngerprints from
daily smudges remaining on the smartphone surface. We strategi-
cally use the latent (cid:128)ngerprint found on the home bu(cid:138)on, albeit
damaged, as a key to reconstruct an image of the enrolled (cid:128)nger-
print, and for the purpose, we exploit the latent (cid:128)ngerprints found
on a touch screen. (cid:140)e a(cid:138)ack procedure includes photographic
smudge collection, (cid:128)ngerprint smudge matching, image quality
assessment, and (cid:128)ngerprint image construction. We verify the re-
constructed image with regard to minutiae quality, match scores,
and (cid:128)ngerprint image quality. Although manual photography and
minute adjustment work are necessary, the remaining procedures
are automated by our so(cid:137)ware implementation. Subsequently, we
conduct an experimental study of our a(cid:138)ack by recruiting par-
ticipants under privacy protection agreement (Section 4). A(cid:137)er
collecting more than 400 latent (cid:128)ngerprints le(cid:137) by seven users
in six conditions (tapping, passcode-typing, text-typing, facebook,
in-pocket, wiping), we show how much realistic our a(cid:138)ack is by
measuring the quality of the constructed images in comparison
with the (cid:128)rm impression of the genuine (cid:128)ngerprints.
We then investigate the users’ touch behavior and perception
gap by conducting in-person surveys followed by extra selective
interviews (Section 5). We ask participants (82 Apple Touch ID
users) the survey questions regarding Touch ID experience, (cid:128)nger-
print enrollment, (cid:128)nger preferences on a home bu(cid:138)on and a touch
screen, and also the risk perception. We try to validate their an-
swers by asking follow-up actions, and selectively semi-structured
interviews. We also discuss the limitations of our studies. We (cid:128)-
nally discuss mitigation methods and future directions regarding
our a(cid:138)ack and user perception gap (Section 6).
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Fingerprint Recognition in Smartphones. Since Apple intro-
duced Touch ID in 2013, a high de(cid:128)nition capacitive touch sensor
has been popularly built into a home bu(cid:138)on of smartphones, al-
lowing a user to easily unlock a device with a (cid:128)ngertip [23]. For
instance, a user enrolls at most “(cid:128)ve” (cid:128)ngerprints to use Touch
ID a(cid:137)er se(cid:138)ing a passcode as a fall-back method. Internally, the
passcode in combination with a factory-installed device key is used
to decrypt the class keys that are actually used to protect user data.
In Touch ID, one of the enrolled (cid:128)ngerprints, not incurring (cid:128)ve
subsequent failed a(cid:138)empts, is used to retrieve a temporary encryp-
tion key (TEK) which is stored in Touch ID at most for 48 idle
hours, to decrypt the class keys either [23]. Fingerprint templates
are stored in secure hardware environments, e.g., Secure Enclave
in Apple iPhones and ARM TrustZone in Samsung Galaxy series,
to prevent leakage and reconstruction of (cid:128)ngerprints from those
templates [18, 23]. Recent works showed that many touch sensor
users perceive (cid:128)ngerprint recognition is more usable and secure
than the alternatives (e.g., passcode) in smartphones [7, 11].
Small Fingerprint Sensors. As shown in Table 1, the touch sen-
sors employed in smartphones are very small in size, yielding the
reduced sensing area. Such small sensors can capture only a partial
portion of the full (cid:128)ngerprint and extract a reduced number of
minutiae [15] while the minimum image dimension required for
(cid:128)ngerprint capture is 12.7 × 16.5 mm (209.6 mm2) [31].
(cid:140)ere are prior works to study the small sensor problems with
regard to performance degradation [15, 42] and multiple registra-
tion [29, 35]. (cid:140)ey showed that matcher performance is signi(cid:128)cantly
degraded by image cropping and multiple registration, respectively,
exposing potential vulnerabilities. Roy et al. studied that a possi-
bility of generating a “MasterPrint” composed of multiple partial
(cid:128)ngerprints which can be used to impersonate multiple users [35].
(cid:140)ey studied small (cid:128)ngerprint sensors with (cid:128)rm impressions.
Our study is di(cid:130)erent from the prior works because we are inter-
ested in smudges and latent (cid:128)ngerprints remaining on smartphones.
Latent Fingerprints. In forensice science, a number of studies
dealt with latent (cid:128)ngerprints in the literature. Since the latent (cid:128)n-
gerprints imply any accidental (cid:128)ngerprint impressions le(cid:137) on a
surface, regardless of whether it is visible or invisible at the time
of deposition, various kinds of physical, chemical, and illumina-
tion methods were studied for the development and visualization
of latent (cid:128)ngerprints, e.g., powder dusting [37], visual chemical
reaction [28], and laser [10]. However, we are rather interested in
the se(cid:138)ing of smudge a(cid:138)acks on smartphones [2].
Latent (cid:128)ngerprints are typically obtained under non-ideal ac-
quisition conditions, e.g., with noise, and thus it is necessary to
reconstruct and enhance them. (cid:140)ere are prior works of recon-
struction and enhancement of latent (cid:128)ngerprints [14, 25, 44]. We
513are motivated by those works regarding image preprocessing tech-
niques, such as gray-scale [20] and histogram equalization [19]
used in the reconstruction process.
Smudge Attacks. In 2010, Aviv et al. (cid:128)rst studied smudge a(cid:138)acks
on Android unlock pa(cid:138)erns by photographing a surface and retriev-
ing smudges of pa(cid:138)erns [2]. To explore the feasibility of smudge
a(cid:138)acks on unlock pa(cid:138)erns, they examined a variety of lighting
and camera conditions that allowed easier pa(cid:138)ern retrieval, also
a(cid:130)ected our photograph se(cid:138)ings, and formulated several situations
(normal touch, application usage, in-pocket) to simulate real us-
age of smartphones. (cid:140)eir results showed that smudges could be
exploited to guess secret pa(cid:138)erns drawn on a touch screen.
(cid:140)e above works are the strong (cid:128)eld evidence that we rely on: It
is possible to deceive small touch sensors of smartphones once an
image of a partial (cid:128)ngerprint is a(cid:138)ained in good quality.
Related So(cid:133)ware. For semi-automation of our a(cid:138)ack, we imple-
ment image processing and veri(cid:128)cation so(cid:137)ware in Python us-
ing the OpenCV library [5] and NIST NBIS packages that involve
MINDTCT, BOZORTH3, and NFIQ [41].
Zhang et al. demonstrated (cid:128)ngerprint a(cid:138)acks against touch-
enabled devices to infer user pins or passwords from (cid:128)ngerprints
le(cid:137) on a touch screen [45]. Dusting and various image processing
techniques were used. By sharpening (cid:128)ngerprints and removing the
background, they automatically mapped the (cid:128)ngerprints to speci(cid:128)c
keys and inferred users passwords.
(cid:140)e prior works on smudge a(cid:138)acks strongly motivated our study
but we are interested in discovering latent (cid:128)ngerprints and recon-
structing an e(cid:130)ective image of partial (cid:128)ngerprints from them.
Fingerprint Spoo(cid:128)ng Attacks. (cid:140)ere are many prior works on
spoo(cid:128)ng (cid:128)ngerprints to deceive (cid:128)ngerprint recognition sensors,
such as optical, capacitive, tactile, and thermal sensors [38]. (cid:140)ey
used various materials including glue, gelatin, latex, silicon, and
thermoplastic to make arti(cid:128)cial (cid:128)ngers and targeted real-world
(cid:128)ngerprint sensors [13, 16, 30]. For the purpose, they all exploited
(cid:128)rm impressions of the full (cid:128)ngerprints.
In 2004, Germany’s Chaos Computer Club presented how to
photograph a full (cid:128)ngerprint imprinted on the glass surface by
adding graphite powder, and exploit the photo image to fake the
(cid:128)ngerprint using wood glue [8]. In 2013, the same group showed
that the same method can be adopted to defeat partial (cid:128)ngerprint
recognition in iPhone 5S [1]. Due to the popularity and the a(cid:138)ractive
small size of touch sensors, many people joined these a(cid:138)empts.
Indeed, there are many (cid:128)eld works on spoo(cid:128)ng partial (cid:128)ngerprints
to deceive touch sensors, e.g., including public videos as listed
in Table 4 in Appendix A. Wood glue was solely used for direct
casting of a (cid:128)ngerprint but with target user’s cooperation, e.g.,
against Galaxy S5 [22], and iPhone 6 [33], respectively. Another
approach was to make a mold with various materials and cast a
