Hello, I found Scrollspy doesn't support Chinese ID Targets.
In order to reproduce the bug, I post a gist. It looks almost the same to the
example from official Doc. A slight difference is that I modify one element's
id("mdo") into a Chinese ID ("艾姆滴欧").
When you view the html file in your browser, you can see that it can spy all
the target elements except that element with Chinese ID.
