4.3 Incentives and Participation
In the following, we measure how liquidators are incentivized to
engage in liquidations and elaborate on the status quo of liquidator
participation.
Liquidator Profit & Loss. To measure the profit of each liqui-
4.3.1
dation event, we assume that the purchased collateral is immedi-
ately sold by the liquidator at the price given by the price oracle.
The total profit by the 28,138 liquidations sums up to a total of
63.59M USD. To better understand the temporal evolution of liqui-
dation profits, we show the monthly collective profit yielded from
each platform in Figure 5.
MakerDAO notably shows an outlier in March, 2020, when the
MarkerDAO monthly profit reached 13.13M USD. This outlier is
due to the Ethereum network congestion caused by the 43% ETH
price market collapse on the 13th March, 2020 [1]. The liquidation
bots were not acting accordingly, which caused the liquidation
transactions to not be swiftly included in the blockchain. This delay
allowed other capable liquidators to manually win the auctions at
a negligible cost.
In November, 2020, an irregular DAI price provided by the Com-
pound price oracle [2] allowed liquidators to profit in total 8.38M USD.
We also observe that Compound contributes a strong liquidation
profit of 9.61M USD in February, 2021, which, however, does not
seem related to any bot failure or oracle irregularity.
To study the number of liquidators, we assume that each unique
Ethereum address represents one liquidator. We then identify a
total of 2,011 unique liquidators. On average the liquidators yield
a profit of 31.62K USD each. We show the number of liquidators
and their average profit on the four considered platforms in Table 1.
Remarkably, the most active liquidator performs 2,482 liquidations
alone, which yield a total profit of 741.75K USD. The most profitable
liquidator generates 5.84M USD in only 112 liquidations.
We also discover 641 MakerDAO liquidations that are not prof-
itable and incur a total loss of 467.44K USD. After manually inspect-
ing those non-profitable liquidation transactions, we can confirm
that the liquidation losses are caused by collateral price fluctuations
during the auctions.

tocol, we plot the accumulative collateral sold through liqui-
dation (April, 2019 to April, 2021).
node, on an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X with 64 cores, 256
GB of RAM and 2 × 8 TB NVMe SSD in Raid 0 configuration. An
Ethereum archive node stores not only the blockchain data but also
the chain state at every historical block, which supports efficient
historical state query (e.g., the borrowing position debt amount at
a specific block). At the time of writing, an Ethereum archive node
requires over 4 TB disk space.
The Ethereum events are essentially EVM logs, which are also
recorded on-chain. An event is indexed by its signature, a 256-bit
hash, and the contract address emitting this event. We hence can
filter the liquidation events emitted from the studied lending pools.
We also build our own custom Ethereum client based on the
golang-based geth client4 to execute transactions on a specific
block (the block state is downloaded from the archive node) when
necessary. For instance, in Section 5.2, we validate our optimal fixed
spread liquidation strategy through concrete executions on past
blockchain states.
4.2 Overall Statistics
In total, we observe 28,138 successful liquidations from the incep-
tion5 of the four platforms to block 12344944, the last block in the
month of April, 2021. We normalize the values of different cryp-
tocurrencies to USD according to the prices given by the platforms’
on-chain price oracles at the block when the liquidation is settled.
We crawl this data on-chain, and do not rely on an external price
oracle, or API.
In Figure 4, we present the accumulative collateral sold through
liquidation in terms of USD. The overall liquidated collateral on
the four platforms Aave, Compound, dYdX, and MakerDAO ac-
cumulates to a total of 807.46M USD. We notice an increase on
Compound in November, 2020. This is caused by an irregular DAI
price provided by the Compound price oracle, which triggers a
large volume of cryptocurrencies to be liquidated [2]. Another re-
markable boost on Compound in February, 2021 is caused by the
drastic fluctuations in prices of cryptocurrencies [3].

Figure 5: Monthly accumulated liquidator profit. We observe an outlier for MakerDAO in March, 2020, because the MakerDAO
liquidation bots were faulty due to an excessive price decline of ETH. The outlier for Compound in November, 2020 is caused
by an irregular price reported by a price oracle.
Figure 6: Gas prices paid by liquidators. We also report the 6000-blocks (1 day) moving average of the block median measured
on-chain. Interestingly, several liquidations are below the average gas price. We notice a gas price spike in March, 2020 because
of a collapse of ETH price [1]. There is an uptrend of gas price since May, 2020 due to the growing popularity of DeFi.
Fixed Spread Liquidations. We observe 3,809, 1,039, 6,766 and
4.3.2
9,762 settled liquidations on Aave V1, Aave V2, Compound and
dYdX respectively.
Liquidator Participation. In Figure 6, we show the gas price of
every fixed spread liquidation transaction along with the average
gas price. Note that we show the 6000-block moving average of
the block gas price medians in the figure to smooth the curve for
readability. The data in Figure 6 shows that many liquidators pay
significant gas fees (the y-axis is a log scale). We find that 73.97%
of the liquidations pay an above average transaction fee, and hence
allows the conclusion that liquidation events are competitive.
4.3.3 Auction Liquidations. Out of the recorded 6,762 MakerDAO
liquidations, 3,377 auctions terminate in the tend phase and the
other 3,385 auctions terminate in the dent phase. The average num-
ber of bidders participating in a liquidation is only 1.99. We notice
that 2.63± 1.96 bids (1.58± 0.95 tend bids and 1.06± 1.62 dent bids),
are placed per auction.
Duration. We define the duration of a MakerDAO liquidation
auction, as the time difference between the auction initiation and
finalization. To capture time, we resort to the block timestamps. We
visualize the duration of the MakerDAO liquidations in Figure 7. On
average, an liquidation lasts for 2.06 ± 6.43 hours (mean±standard
deviation). There are 4,173 auctions terminating within one hour.
We observe that few liquidations last longer than intended, which
can be explained by that fact that the respective liquidators did not
finalize the auction and hence didn’t claim the liquidation proceeds.
For example, the longest auction lasts for 346.67 hours, while its
last bid is placed 344.60 hours prior to the termination.

Table 2: Statistics of Type I/II bad debts on Aave, Compound
and dYdX at block 12344944 (30th Apr 2021). For instance, if
it costs 100 USD for a borrower to repay its debt, then 2, 550
(32.0%) of the lending position are classified as Type II bad
debts on Compound, which causes 14.3K USD collateral
value to be locked.

comparison of different auction designs for future work.
4.4.2 Bad Debts. We define a borrowing position as a bad debt if
it is financially rationale for neither the borrowers nor the lending
platform to close the position. In the following we introduce two
types of bad debts.
(1) Type I bad debt (Under-collateralized position): If the
collateral value falls below the value of the debt, then either
the borrower or the lending platform will suffer a loss if the
corresponding position is closed. Type I bad debt is typically
caused by overdue liquidations. An overdue liquidation can,
e.g., occur when the collateral/debt asset suffers a severe
price fluctuation or the blockchain network is congested.
(2) Type II bad debt (Excessive Transaction Fees): When
an over-collateralized position is closed, the borrower will
regain the excess asset used for over-collateralization. How-
ever, if the value of the excess asset cannot cover the transac-
tion fee, then there is no incentive for the borrower to repay
and close this position.
Because the value of the debt plus transaction fee is superior
to the value of the bad debt collateral, repaying bad debt is not a
financially rational endeavor for a borrower. The accumulation of
bad debt reduces the total liquidity in a lending protocol, which
necessarily leads to higher interest rates for borrowers. If the lend-
ing pool maintains exclusively bad debts, lenders will not be able
to withdraw funds.
In the following we quantitatively measure the amount of bad
debts present in existing lending protocols. To that end, we first
have to assume a somewhat random cost which a borrower would
need to bear, when repaying debt. For the sake of the example here,
we choose a cost of 100 USD to repay the debt, and consider the
blockchain state at block 12344944 (30th Apr 2021). Given this cost,
we have identified in total 351/3,525 Type I/II bad debts (cf. Table 2).
Remarkably, the liquidity of Aave V2 is reduced by 87.4K USD due
to existing bad debts. It is worth mentioning that dYdX does not
have any Type I bad debt at block 12344944. This is, because dYdX
apparently uses an external insurance fund, to write off bad debts
of Type I.
4.4.3 Unprofitable Liquidations. We define a liquidation opportu-
nity as unprofitable if the bonus collected by the liquidator cannot

Figure 7: Duration of the MakerDAO liquidations. Interest-
ingly, auctions last longer than they’re configured to. We
can observe a change in system auction parameters after the
13th March, 2020 event (the MakerDAO liquidation inci-
dent).
Bid Intervals. To better understand the bidding process of the
various liquidators, we study the number of bids, and their re-
spective intervals. We note that the first bid is placed on aver-
age 4.12 ± 25.52 minutes after the auction initiation. Given that
an auction can last several hours, it appears that most bidders
engage early in the auction process. We observe that 4,537 auc-
tions terminate with more than one bid placed. It also appears that
bids come close together, as the average interval between bids is
38.97 ± 89.34 minutes.
4.4 Risks
We proceed to discuss the risks that the participants of a lending
pool (i.e., borrowers, lenders and liquidators) bear in liquidations.
4.4.1 The Problem of Over-Liquidation. We observe that the liqui-
dation mechanisms of Aave and Compound grant a liquidator the
right to liquidate up to 50% of the collateral (i.e., the close factor)
once a debt becomes liquidatable. dYdX even allows a liquidator to
purchase 100% of the collateral at the fixed spread discount.
Such design decision favor the liquidators over the borrowers,
as a debt can likely be rescued by selling less than 50% of its value.
Choosing an appropriate close factor is challenging, because the
liquidation mechanism should minimize the number of liquida-
tion events and overall transactions due to the limited transaction
throughput of blockchains.
Auction mechanisms do not specify a close factor and hence offer
a more granular method to liquidate collateral. In return, auction
liquidators are exposed to the risk of loss due to the price fluc-
tuations of the collateral during the liquidation (cf. Appendix A).
The MakerDAO tend-dent auction, is to the best of our knowledge,
the only auction mechanism that is widely adopted in blockchain
liquidations. Yet, the liquidation bots must remain robust and vig-
ilant under blockchain congestion, otherwise the borrowers may
endure excessive losses [1]. Some alternative auction mechanisms
(e.g., Vickrey auction [9] and Dutch reverse auctions [22]) may
have potential in mitigating the over-liquidation problem and could

Table 3: Statistics of unprofitable liquidation opportuni-
ties on Aave, Compound and dYdX at block 12344944
(30th Apr 2021). For instance, Aave configures a 50% liqui-
dation threshold with at most 15% liquidation spread. Based
on our measurement, at least 59.1% of the Aave liquidation
opportunities are not profitable if the liquidation process
costs 100.
