#### File Type Identification
- **Importance of File Type Characteristics**
  - Understanding the characteristics of various file types is crucial for their identification.
  - We will now use the tools to further explore these characteristics.

#### Compressed or Encrypted?
- **Visual Inspection**
  - It is impossible to determine whether a file is compressed or encrypted by simply looking at its image.
- **Histogram Analysis**
  - A histogram can make it easier to distinguish between compressed and encrypted files.

#### Packed or Not Packed?
- **WinZip32.exe Example**
  - Histogram shows a large number of zeros.
  - Zoomed-in histogram provides more detailed insights.

#### Are You Hiding Something?
- **Hidden Data in Files**
  - Sometimes, histograms and entropy are less effective in detecting hidden data.
  - **Original Image**
    - Entropy (H): 7.61037
    - Small aberrations in the histogram may not be easily noticeable.
  - **Image with Appended Data**
    - Entropy (H): 7.63532
    - The appended data at the end of the file can be revealed through an image analysis.
    - Remember, bitmaps start from the bottom up.
    - The larger the appended data, the more its entropy characteristics become apparent.

#### Using Steganography?
- **LSB Steganography**
  - LSB steganography hides data in the least significant bits of an image.
  - Very difficult to detect if the number of bits used is small.
- **XOR Encryption Example**
  - 0x14 XOR 0x5a -> 0x4e “N”
  - Textual histogram shows that "C", "A", "N", "D" are more prevalent than other characters.
  - With some sleuthing, assumptions, analysis tools, and a bit of luck, you can identify the hidden data.

#### Tool: Statistical Analyzer
- **Overview**
  - Combines file searching (Footprint) and file type identification (Write Bitmap Histogram).
  - Searches entire directory structures and attempts to identify file types.
  - Uses histograms and multiple statistics.
  - Currently, it does not use magic numbers as a clue.
  - Highlights any abnormalities.
  - Detailed information is available in a 50+ minute presentation.
