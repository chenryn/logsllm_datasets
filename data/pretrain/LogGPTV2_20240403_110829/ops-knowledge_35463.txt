User: I have python program that I've been writing on Ubuntu. For some reasons I could not properly installed on windows few libraries that I used, there are some problems I can't solve in libraries. I used PyInstaller to build run file in Ubuntu. And it is works perfectly. But now I faced a problem, I need to run this application on windows. And it specifically need to be an exe file, so I would not need to install ubuntu vmware on every PC in which I use this app. So is there any solution to compile/convert run file to exe?
Assistant: if you can't get the python to run on windows a packaged exe version is impossible.
