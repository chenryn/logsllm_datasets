### Definition and Parameters
We define "few" as one or two active addresses, and "recently" as the last three Full Rounds. Therefore, we use the Low Address Block Rule (LABR) when the number of active addresses (\(|\hat{E}_{3FR}|\)) is less than 3. This threshold ensures that decisions are not based on a small number of addresses, where packet loss could significantly alter the results.

### Asymmetric Outcome
This algorithm produces an asymmetric outcome: it can confirm that blocks are up but not that they are down. We believe this outcome is preferable to the alternatives, such as completely ignoring the block or tolerating false outages. However, we identify LABR blocks to allow researchers who need an estimator that can indicate both up and down states to exclude them from their analysis.

## Evaluation

### Full Block Scanning Reduces Noise
#### Case Study: One Block in CenturyLink
Figure 1 illustrates a case study of one block in CenturyLink (AS209, a U.S. ISP) with outage analysis.

- **Initial State**: The block initially has only 8 addresses responding.
- **Down Event (2017-10-27)**: A usage change causes a down event with no address response for approximately 13 hours. This event is consistent with other blocks in the same AS.
- **Lone Address (2017-11-14 to 2017-12-17)**: A single address responds for 18 days, followed by the block receiving new users.
- **Partial Outage (2017-11-16)**: A partial outage is observed only from our Los Angeles site, not from other Trinocular sites.

**Trinocular Results**: The third bar in Figure 1 shows frequent unknown states, leading to false down events, especially when block usage is sparse in October and early November.

**Full Block Scanning (FBS) Results**: The second graph in Figure 1 resolves this uncertainty. FBS provides more information, confirming that the block is usually up while recognizing the usage change and the partial outage. However, in between, there are two down events inferred by a single address, which are changed to unknown by LABR (top graph in Figure 1).

### False Outages: Does FBS Remove Noise?
From the single block example, we consider the broader context of a country's Internet. Our goal is to determine if FBS reduces noise by examining false down events (blocks correctly recovered by FBS because they were observation noise).

#### Iraqi Government-Mandated Outages (February 2017)
Iraq experienced seven government-mandated Internet outages (local mornings on February 2, and also the 4th through 9th) to prevent cheating during academic placement exams [5]. This scenario is particularly challenging for FBS, as closely spaced short outages test the algorithm's accuracy and precision. Additionally, a high fraction of blocks in Iraq are sparse. We identified 1176 Iraqi blocks using Maxmind’s city-level database [9], of which 666 are sparse.

**Figure 2**: Shows Iraqi outages in 2017q1, grouped in 660-second time bins. The top line (purple) represents outages without FBS, and the bottom line (green) represents outages with FBS. The Iraqi exam week is highlighted in gray on the left, and a larger scale plot of that week is shown on the right.

- **Exam Week**: During the seven large peaks, most Iraqi blocks (nearly 900, or 76%) are down—these are true outages. Outside the peaks, a few blocks (the 20 to 40 purple line, without FBS) are often down, likely false outages.
- **Noise Reduction**: FBS suppresses most background outages (85% of outage area), reducing the median number of down blocks from 26 to 1. This reduction is confirmed by examining 34 down events in 10 randomly-selected time periods; nearly all (33 events, 97% of purple) were in sparse blocks, with one diurnal block.

### True Outages: Does FBS Remove Legitimate Outages?
Next, we examine how Full Block Scanning interacts with known outage events. Its goal is to remove noise and false outages, but if FBS is too aggressive, it may accidentally remove legitimate outages (true down events) (Figure 3).

**Figure 3**: Compares the seven nationwide outages corresponding with Iraqi exams, with and without FBS. The purple dots represent "peak outage" without FBS, and the green dots represent peak outage with FBS. FBS removes somewhat less than half of the down events, with peaks around 440 to 560 instead of 790 to 910 blocks.

- **Event Duration**: FBS affects only 35% of events in the red box in the lower left corner. Sparse blocks are the primary source of attenuation.
- **Worst-Case Scenario**: Many blocks are sparse, and the events are just shorter than one full round. If the event was longer, FBS would have less impact.

### Confusion Matrix
Table 2 presents a confusion matrix of 5200 Trinocular-detected down events in 50 random blocks (Dataset A30, 2017q4).

| FBS | True Condition (Manually Observed) |
|------|------------------------------------|
| UP   | 4133 (79%, FBS fixes)              |
| DOWN | 621 (12%, FBS misses)              |
|      | 446 (9%, FBS confirms)             |

### Comparison of Down Time and Events
**Figure 4**: Compares per-block down time (left) and the number of down events (right) with and without FBS. The figures show that FBS effectively reduces the number of false outages while preserving true outages.

- **Left Panel**: Per-block down time.
- **Right Panel**: Number of down events.

By using FBS, we achieve a more accurate and reliable detection of Internet outages, especially in sparse blocks.
