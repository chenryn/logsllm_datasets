TCP/IP Settings
Changing a Server’s IP Address
Changing a server’s IP address isn’t as simple as changing the TCP/IP settings. Address 
information is set throughout the system when you set up the server. To make sure 
that all the necessary changes are made, use the changeip command.
To change a server’s IP address:
1 Run the changeip tool:
$ changeip [(directory|-)] old-ip new-ip [old-hostname new-hostname]
For more information or examples, see the man page.
2 Use the networksetup or serversetup command (or the Network pane of System 
Preferences) to change the server’s IP address in its network settings.
3 Restart the server.
Parameter
Description
directory
If the server is an Open Directory master or replica, or is connected 
to a directory system, you must include the path to the directory 
domain (directory node). For a standalone server, type “-” instead.
old-ip
The current IP address.
new-ip
The new IP address.
old-hostname
(optional) The current DNS host name of the server.
new-hostname

You can use the mount_afp command to mount an AFP volume. For more information, 
type man mount_afp to see the man page.
Mounting Volumes
You can use the mount command with parameters appropriate to the type of file 
system you want to mount, or use one of these file-system-specific mount commands:
• mount_afp for Apple File Protocol (AppleShare) volumes
• mount_cd9660 for ISO 9660 volumes
• mount_cddafs for CD Digital Audio format (CDDA) volumes
• mount_hfs for Apple Hierarchical File System (HFS) volumes

Chapter 6    Working With Disks and Volumes
Monitoring Disk Space
When you need more vigilant monitoring of disk space than the log rolling scripts 
provide, you can use the diskspacemonitor command-line tool. It lets you monitor 
disk space and take action more frequently than once a day when disk space is critically 
low, and gives you the opportunity to provide your own action scripts.
diskspacemonitor is disabled by default. You can enable it by opening a Terminal 
window and typing sudo diskspacemonitor on. You may be prompted for your 
password. Type man diskspacemonitor for more information about the command-
line options.
When enabled, diskspacemonitor uses information in a configuration file to 
determine when to execute alert and recovery scripts for reclaiming disk space:
• The configuration file is /etc/diskspacemonitor/diskspacemonitor.conf. It lets you 
specify how often you want to monitor disk space and thresholds to use for 
determining when to take the actions in the scripts. By default, disks are checked 
every 10 minutes, an alert script executed when disks are 75% full, and a recovery 
script executed when disks are 85% full. To edit the configuration file, log in to the 
server as an administrator and use a text editor to open the file. See the comments in 
the file for additional information. 
• By default, two predefined action scripts are executed when the thresholds are 
reached. 
The default alert script is /etc/diskspacemonitor/action/alert. It runs in accord with 
instructions in configuration file /etc/diskspacemonitor/alert.conf. It sends email to 
recipients you specify.
The default recovery script is /etc/diskspacemonitor/action/recover. It runs in accord 
with instructions in configuration file /etc/diskspacemonitor/recover.conf. 
See the comments in the script and configuration files for more information about 
these files.
• If you want to provide your own alert and recovery scripts, you can. Put your 
alert script in /etc/diskspacemonitor/action/alert.local and your recovery script in 
/etc/diskspacemonitor/action/recovery.local. Your scripts will be executed before the 
default scripts when the thresholds are reached. 
To configure the scripts on a server from a remote Mac OS X computer, open a Terminal 
window and log in to the remote server using SSH.

Reclaiming Disk Space Using Log Rolling Scripts
Three predefined scripts are executed automatically to reclaim space used on your 
server for log files generated by 
• Apple file service 
• Windows service
• Web service 
• Web performance cache
• Mail service
• Print service
The scripts use values in the following configuration files to determine whether and 
how to reclaim space: 
• The script /etc/periodic/daily/600.daily.server runs daily. Its configuration file is 
/etc/diskspacemonitor/daily.server.conf.
• The script /etc/periodic/weekly/600.weekly.server is intended to run weekly, but is 
currently empty. Its configuration file is /etc/diskspacemonitor/weekly.server.conf.
• The script /etc/periodic/monthly/600.monthly.server is intended to run monthly, but 
is currently empty. Its configuration file is /etc/diskspacemonitor/monthly.server.conf.
As configured, the scripts specify actions that complement the log file management 
performed by the services listed above, so don’t modify them. All you need to do is log 
in as an administrator and use a text editor to define thresholds in the configuration 
files that determine when the actions are taken:
• the number of megabytes a log file must contain before its space is reclaimed
• the number of days since a log file’s last modification that need to pass before its 
space is reclaimed
Specify one or both thresholds. The actions are taken when either threshold is 
exceeded.
There are several additional parameters you can specify. Refer to comments in the 
configuration files for information about all the parameters and how to set them. The 
scripts ignore all log files except those for which at least one threshold is present in the 
configuration file.
To configure the scripts on a server from a remote Mac OS X computer, open a Terminal 
window and log in to the remote server using SSH. Then open a text editor and edit 
the scripts.
You can also use the diskspacemonitor command-line tool to reclaim disk space.

Managing Disk Journaling
Checking to See if Journaling is Enabled
You can use the mount command to see if journaling is enable on a volume.
To see if journaling is enabled:
$ mount
Look for journaled in the attributes in parentheses following a volume. For example:
/dev/disk0s9 on / (local, journaled)
Turning on Journaling for an Existing Volume
You can use the diskutil command to enable journaling on a volume without 
affecting existing files on the volume.
Important:  Always check the volume for disk errors using the fsck_hfs command 
before you turn on journaling.
To enable journaling:
$ diskutil enableJournal volume
Example
$ mount
/dev/disk0s9 on / (local, journaled)
/dev/disk0s10 on /Volumes/OS 9.2.2 (local)
$ sudo fsck_hfs /dev/disk0s10/
** /dev/rdisk0s10
** Checking HFS plus volume.
** Checking extents overflow file.
** Checking Catalog file.
** Checking Catalog hierarchy.
** Checking volume bitmap.
** Checking volume information.
** The volume OS 9.2.2 appears to be OK.
$ diskutil enableJournal /dev/disk0s10
Allocated 8192K for journal file.
Journaling has been enabled on /dev/disk0s10
$ mount
/dev/disk0s9 on / (local, journaled)
/dev/disk0s10 on /Volumes/OS 9.2.2 (local, journaled)

a disk.
To enable journaling when erasing a disk:
$ newfs_hfs -J -v volname device
Disabling Journaling
To disable journaling:
$ diskutil disableJournal volume
Erasing, Partitioning, and Formatting Disks
You can use the diskutil command to partition, erase, or format a disk. For more 
information, see the man page.
Setting Up a Case-Sensitive HFS+ File System
You can use the diskutil tool to format a drive for case-sensitive HFS.
Note:  Volumes you format as case-sensitive HFS are also journaled.
To format a Mac OS Extended volume as case-sensitive HFS+:
$ sudo diskutil eraseVolume "Case-sensitive HFS+" newvolname volume
For more information, see the man page for diskutil.

Chapter 6    Working With Disks and Volumes
Imaging and Cloning Volumes Using ASR
You can use Apple Software Restore (ASR) to copy a disk image onto a volume or 
prepare existing disk images with checksum information for faster copies. ASR can 
perform file copies, in which individual files are restored to a volume unless an identical 
file is already there, and block copies, which restore entire disk images. The asr utility 
doesn’t create the disk images. You can use hdiutil to create disk images from 
volumes or folders.
You must run ASR as the root user or with sudo root permissions. You cannot use ASR 
on read/write disk images.
To image a boot volume:
1 Install and configure Mac OS X on the volume as you want it.
2 Restart from a different volume.
3 Make sure the volume you’re imaging has permissions enabled.
4 Use hditutil to make a read-write disk image of the volume.
