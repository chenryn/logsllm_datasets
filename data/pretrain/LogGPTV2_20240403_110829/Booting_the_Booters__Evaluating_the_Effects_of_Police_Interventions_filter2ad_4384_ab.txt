The second dataset comes from the booters themselves
which, presumably to assist in marketing, report a running
total of the attacks they have performed. This data has been
collected on a weekly basis since November 2017.
We know that booters use SQL databases to hold de-
tails of users and attacks because large numbers of these
databases have been leaked. The source of many booters has
also been leaked and we invariably find PHP code such as:
$TotalUsers = $odb->query(“SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
‘users‘”)->fetchColumn(0); $TotalAttacks = $odb->query(
“SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ‘logs‘”)->fetchColumn(0); i.e.
(97%), ‘PORTMAP’ 11 497/11 858 (97%), ‘SUDP’ 21 922/235 905 (9%),
‘UDPKILL’ 3 058/10 507 (29%), and ‘UDPRAND’ 1 638/5 604 (29%).
Of the 72 878 attacks whose names suggest they are not entirely UDP
based (TS3KILL, TS3, VOX, FRAG, ZAP, ICMP, DOMINATE, ACK,
VSE, SYN, COD, RST), we observed 21 598 (30%) with coverage rates
between 20% and 50%.
fetching counts directly from the SQL database, followed by
display code such as Users: 
Attacks: .
A handful of booters have clearly inflated their counts (one
counted from 150 000 rather than zero – trivially done in
the PHP code) and some wipe their databases (and hence
zero their counts) from time to time. One booter reported
values which were regularly multiples of 1000 and we exclude
it. However, we can see no other obvious artificial patterns
within the dataset, but for good measure we performed some
statistical tests on the weekly totals to determine if they
might have been algorithmically generated.
Count data tends to be heteroskedastistic i.e. as numbers
go up the variance in the series will be found to increase
as well. Many of the smaller or shorter booter series show
too high a degree of variance or nonlinearity to perform
meaningful tests for this effect. However, we conducted linear
regression analysis and performed White’s heteroskedasticity
test on those booters where this was valid. We also performed
skewness kurtosis tests for normality on these series, as real-
world data are often normally distributed, and faking with
random data would produce uniform distributions. Our anal-
ysis indicated that the top ten most active booters’ attack
series were normally distributed or heteroskedastistic (with
most being both) at 95% confidence. We further checked if
simple multipliers were being applied to otherwise genuine
data, but no sequences of any length had values which were
all divisible by any prime less than 50.

IMC’19, October 21–23, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands
We conclude that if booters were generating fake data
to feed their live attack counters, they would have to have
considerable statistical acumen to reproduce the distributions
we observe. Of course we cannot completely rule out forgery
by booter operators with a deep knowledge of statistics,
but this does not seem especially likely. Furthermore, the
booter self-reported dataset shows moderate correlation with
our own reflected attack dataset (a correlation coefficient
of 0.47) and, most importantly, shows large drops in attack
numbers in the same places and for the same durations as the
significant drops we observe in our attack time series, which
we believe to correspond to law enforcement interventions.
This second dataset can also be used to determine when
booters first appear, how many booters are taken down each
week, and how many subsequently reappear. Unfortunately,
the ‘birth’ data is irredeemably biased by the data collec-
tion process in that new booters were only searched for
at somewhat irregular intervals. However, the ‘death’ and
‘resurrection’ data can be usefully analysed to determine if
interventions affect users (they choose to do fewer attacks) or
booter operators (they choose to enter or leave the market).
4 MODELLING THE DATA
It’s extremely difficult to measure directly the effect on
crime of law enforcement interventions. Empirical associa-
tions, causal effects, and the presence of extraneous variables
are all hard to quantify, and thus mechanisms are hard to
demonstrate through ‘true experiments’. In a forthcoming
paper, we attempt to trace some of these mechanisms em-
pirically through mixed-methods qualitative work, however
here we focus on an in-depth quantitative approach. Where
practical or ethical issues make it impossible to carry out
classic experiments with treatment and control groups and
randomisation (as in this case), it is well-established within
criminology and the social sciences that quasi-experimental
designs are an appropriate way of making tentative claims
about the effects of particular interventions [6][52][3].
Where large-scale interventions are attempted which af-
fect entire populations, establishing a suitable control group
can be impossible. We adopt what Cook and Campbell [10]
classify as a time series design, now often referred to as an
interrupted time series approach. This is appropriate where
data takes the form of a time series of observations, with inter-
ventions occurring at specific points in time, assumed to have
an immediate effect, with a clear pre-intervention functional
form, a suitable number of pre-intervention observations, and
a reasonable assumption that no unaccounted-for variable
is responsible for the change in the time series. Denial of
service attacks constitute event count data, which often have
skewed outcomes in practice, and our time series is indeed
non-normalised in distribution. Therefore, a maximum likeli-
hood estimation approach, rather than an ARIMA approach
(which relies on normally-distributed data), is indicated. We
use a negative binomial rather than poisson regression model,
as the events (denial of service attacks) are not independent,
rather there is a simple trend to the data [50][4][11]. We
restricted our modelling to the period June 2016 to April
2019 as there is a clear and fairly constant linear trend over
this period. Weekly totals were used as daily attack counts
showed a high degree of volatility.
Negative binomial regression is a established technique for
modelling count data, and can account for seasonal patterns
and non-stochastic slope components [19]. It is well-suited
to intervention analysis, and has been used to measure the
effects of interventions on criminal offending [5, 60].
Our aim was to analyse the effects of different interven-
tions on the booter market, once seasonal variation and the
underlying trend of the data were accounted for, fitting for
optimum log-pseudolikelihood. Thus for all periods in the
time series which drop significantly below the modelled series,
we added dummy ‘intervention’ variables to model the effect
sizes of these disruptions. We found five such interventions
that were statistically significant and one of the key con-
clusions of this paper is they correspond closely to events
discussed in §2 above.
The model parameters are displayed in Table 1 and Figure 2
shows the correspondence between the model and measured
attacks. We model seasonality over twelve one-month periods,
for which we need eleven seasonal variables in the model. We
included a component in the model to account for the chang-
ing date of Easter in the seasonal analysis, as the patterns
of booting are strongly linked to school holidays. We found
no evidence of multicollinearity in the regression components
used. Statistical data about the interventions is shown in
Table 2. We not only present the overall impact (in the final
column) but also whether these interventions are significant
when we apply the overall model solely to the attacks against
particular countries.
The intervention with the biggest impact (at a 95% con-
fidence level) was the FBI’s Xmas2018 intervention which
lasted for 10 weeks, during which there was a reduction of
between 37% and 27% in overall recorded attacks. However,
in some countries the effect lasted for only three weeks, and
for France the impact was not statistically significant. The
shutdown of HackForums’ SST section (§2.3) was also long-
lived with the market being suppressed for 13 weeks and for
longer in some countries.
The other interventions can be seen to result in smaller
but still significant (in most countries) drops in attack num-
bers. The reporting of high-profile court cases and sentencing
corresponds with short, immediate drops in attack numbers.
For takedowns, the effect is delayed, with the Webstresser
takedown (§2.5) taking effect after a fortnight and lasting 3
weeks. This may be because the totals are distorted by at-
tacks directed at the Netherlands which went up by 146% (i.e.
more than doubled), presumably caused by reprisal attacks
against the Dutch police who had spearheaded the operation.
4.1 Analysing by country
Having seen how the various interventions affected countries
differently we now take a step back and ask to what extent
countries have seen similar patterns of growth in attacks.

components, first order trend, and constant with significance and effect size. Asterisks indicate if inclusion
of an intervention made a significant (*) or strongly significant (**) contribution to the model. The seasonal
variables model the month-by-month seasonality of the data. We also included a separate component for
Easter as school holidays are linked to rises in attacks and the date of Easter is not fixed.
