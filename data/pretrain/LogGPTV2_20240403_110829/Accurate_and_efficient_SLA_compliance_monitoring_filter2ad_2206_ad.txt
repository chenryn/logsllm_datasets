With the parameters of Table 2, the bandwidth savings due to
multi-objective probing is about 100 Kb/s. Separately, the loss
probe stream is about 490 Kb/s, the delay probe stream is about
20 Kb/s, and the delay variation is about 60 Kb/s: a sum of about
570 Kb/s. With SLAM, the probe stream is actually about 470
Kb/s. Note that for the dumbbell topology, the SLAM parameters
used in our experiments result in only about 0.3% of the bottleneck
OC3 consumed for measurement trafﬁc. For the star topology, three
SLAM streams traverse links e3 and e4 (namely, for link e3, paths
r1, r3 and (e5, e3) are monitored, resulting in three streams travers-
ing e3). The measurement trafﬁc consumption on these OC3 links
is still less than 1% of the capacity.
6.2 Delay
Table 3 compares the true delay measured using the DAG-collected
passive traces with the mean delay estimate produced by SLAM
and the estimates produced using standard RFC 2679 [7] (Poisson-
modulated probes), sent at the same rate. Values are shown for
each trafﬁc scenario and are averages over full experiment dura-
tion. Note that the differences in true values are due to inherent
variability in trafﬁc sources, but the results are representative of
tests run with different random seeds. First, we see in Table 3a
that the SLAM results are close to the true values. We also see
that while results for the standard stream are close for the CBR and
long-lived TCP trafﬁc scenarios, they are less accurate for the more
realistic self-similar trafﬁc scenarios, with with relative errors rang-
ing from about 25% to 120%. Second, we see that in Table 3b that
the SLAM results are close to the true values, though somewhat
less accurate than for the simple dumbbell topology. The accuracy
of the mean delay estimate for the RFC 2679 stream varies over the
range of trafﬁc scenarios and paths, but is generally better than in
the dumbbell topology. A possible explanation for this behavior is
that the increased level of aggregation of trafﬁc sources in the star
topology leads to an improvement in mean delay estimates.

the dumbbell topology, and for self-similar trafﬁc on route r1 in
the star topology. Results for other experiments are consistent with
plots shown in Figure 4. True delay estimates are shown for 10
second intervals and estimates for SLAM are shown for 30 sec-
ond intervals. We see that in each case after an initial convergence
period, the SLAM estimate tracks the true delay quite well.
Distribution-Free Quantile Estimation. Figure 5 compares the
true delay distribution with the SLAM-estimated delay distribution
with 90% conﬁdence bounds. Representative plots are shown for
the long-lived TCP trafﬁc scenario in the dumbbell topology (Fig-
ure 5a) and for the CBR UDP trafﬁc scenario in the star topology
(Figure 5b). We see that for these vastly different trafﬁc and topo-
logical setups that the delay distribution is estimated quite well and
that with few exceptions, the conﬁdence bounds include the true
delay distribution for the range of estimated quantiles shown.
Delay Distribution Inference. We now examine the problem of
inferring the delay distribution along a path given measured delay
distributions along a subset of paths. Speciﬁcally, given measure-
ments along paths r2, r3, and r4, we wish to infer the delay distri-
bution for path r1.
Figure 6 shows representative results for two trafﬁc scenarios
considered using the star topology. For these results, we used a bin
width ε of 100 µsec for the input discrete mass distributions. The
computed bound and the actual CDF measured using SLAM are
shown for the CBR UDP trafﬁc (top) and self-similar TCP trafﬁc
(bottom). We see that for each trafﬁc scenario the computed bound
is relatively tight, with the closest qualitative match for the more re-
alistic self-similar trafﬁc scenario. The skewed distribution arising
from the CBR UDP trafﬁc scenario results in an underestimation of
the high delay values along path r1. For the self-similar TCP trafﬁc
scenarios, the delay distributions are somewhat smoother (though
not homogeneous along paths in the star topology), and the result-
ing bounds are tighter.
6.3 Delay Variation
Evaluation of measured delay variation is complicated by the fact
that there is no clear basis by which to compare estimates. As dis-

cussed in § 3, there are multiple deﬁnitions of delay variation, for
example in the RTP standard RFC 3550 and in the IPPM standard
RFC 3393. Therefore, we focus on a comparative analysis among
these two IETF standards and our DV matrix formulation.
We ﬁrst look at the one-way-ipdv metric of RFC 3393. Each
one-way-ipdv sample is produced by choosing consecutive pack-
ets of a probe stream identical to the SLAM stream (48 byte packets
sent at 30 msec intervals). Histograms of one-way-ipdv samples
for the long-lived TCP trafﬁc scenario (left) and for the self-similar
trafﬁc scenario at 60% offered load (right) in the dumbbell topol-
ogy are shown in Figure 7. The plots show that while there is a
narrower range of values for the long-lived TCP source scenario
the shapes of each distribution are qualitatively similar. The nar-
row range for the long-lived TCP scenario arises because the queue
is often close to full. Also, the left tail of the long-lived TCP plot
and both left and right tails of the self-similar plot show that there
are some large one-way-ipdv values. Beyond simple qualitative
observations of these plots, however, it is not clear how queuing dy-
namics along the path are captured by this metric since it only cap-
tures local differences in delays. It is also not clear how one might
infer application performance, e.g., for a VoIP stream, since large
values of one-way-ipdv do not necessarily translate into packet
losses because of underbuffering at an application playout buffer.
