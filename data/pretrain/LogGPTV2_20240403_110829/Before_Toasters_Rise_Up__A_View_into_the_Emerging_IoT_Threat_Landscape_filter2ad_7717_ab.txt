### Intrusion Mechanisms of IoT Botnets

A significant number of IoT botnets rely heavily on the exploitation of the Telnet-based remote management interface, which is often provided by IoT devices. Due to the usual lack of proper security management and poor manufacturing practices, default or hardcoded Telnet login credentials can provide an easy, dictionary-based brute-force attack vector. This typically allows attackers to gain full control over the devices.

#### Honeypot Data Analysis

We observed a total of 11,791,128 Telnet connections (46.5% of the total 25 million) where attackers successfully logged into the honeypots. On average, attackers needed three attempts to guess the correct username and password. Our honeypots are configured with default or easily guessable passwords to capture as many attacks as possible. Additionally, we noted that attackers attempted to log in using 4,095 unique usernames and passwords.

### Vulnerability Exploitation

Recent anecdotal evidence suggests that IoT botnets are increasingly leveraging not only Telnet credential brute-forcing but also exploiting specific software vulnerabilities in IoT device firmware. To investigate this, we used our three high-interaction honeypots to determine how attackers have attempted to exploit these vulnerabilities.

| Brickcom CB-100AP-3456 (IP Camera) | Various vulnerabilities leading to credentials/device information disclosure | [?] | 6                    |

Both the DLink router and the Brickcom IP camera are affected by multiple vulnerabilities, with seven and five of them, respectively, being exploited in the wild. The most exploited vulnerability for both devices leads to credentials disclosure, which is what attackers are primarily seeking. For the DLink router, other exploited vulnerabilities lead to remote command execution or full system takeover. For the Brickcom IP camera, apart from the XSS vulnerability, all other vulnerabilities are related to credentials/device information disclosure and are being exploited.

In total, 411 vulnerability exploitations were observed across the three high-interaction honeypots over a period of four and a half months. While this number is still low compared to the number of Telnet credentials cracking attempts, it indicates that cybercriminals are putting more care and sophistication into building their botnets. This shows a real evolution from the first IoT botnets that relied solely on Telnet credentials brute-forcing.

### IoT Reaper Botnet

One particular botnet, IoT Reaper, appears to heavily rely on software vulnerability exploitation to spread. The botnet emerged in late 2017, exhibiting an aggressive peak of intrusions at the beginning of October 2017. After one month, it entered a quieter phase, possibly due to the botmaster(s) slowing down its growth or attempting to remain under the radar after raising a lot of attention in its first, very active month. The motivations behind IoT Reaperâ€™s operators remain unknown.

### Browsing Attackers

In addition to Telnet credential brute-forcing and vulnerability exploitation, we observed some attackers "browsing" through the web interfaces of the two routers and the IP camera. Table 3 shows a snippet of some URLs requested from the different devices and the actions triggered or information disclosed.

**Table 3: URLs Requested and Actions Triggered**

| Device        | URL Requested                                    | Action Triggered/Information Disclosed |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| DLink 850L    | /admin/status                                    | Status information                     |
|               | /admin/settings                                  | Configuration settings                 |
| Brickcom IP   | /cgi-bin/admin.cgi?action=get&setting=network    | Network settings                       |
| Camera        | /cgi-bin/admin.cgi?action=get&setting=system     | System information                     |
| Netgear WNAP320 | /setup.cgi?next_file=admin_status.html          | Admin status page                      |
|               | /setup.cgi?next_file=admin_network_1.html        | Network configuration page             |

To determine if such "browsing" behavior is generated by individuals or automated scanning tools, we analyzed the time elapsed between HTTP requests from each client IP address. We found that 30% of clients issue requests with an average time gap of less than one second, indicating automated scanning. Conversely, about 10% of clients issue requests with an average time gap of several tens of seconds, suggesting human browsing behavior. Such automated behavior is likely part of reconnaissance or device identification phases.

### Conclusion

Most of the time, the goal of attackers is to gain privileged access to the device to facilitate infection and monetization. Exploiting software vulnerabilities on specific devices can reduce the noise produced by brute-forcing, but it also requires more work and research from the botnet creator. The evolving nature of IoT botnets, particularly the use of diverse and recent vulnerability exploits, highlights the increasing sophistication of these threats.
