Question: "Bob has received a message with a signature he needs to verify. He knows that if the message and signature were generated using a matching pair of keys, the verification should return true. Which algorithmic function should he employ to determine the validity of the signature?"
 "A": "He should use the signing algorithm with his own private key to check if he can generate the same signature."
 "B": "He should use the key generation algorithm to see if it can produce a matching pair of keys for the received message and signature."
 "C": "He should use the verification algorithm with the senderâ€™s public key to determine if the signature is valid for the message."
 "D": "He should use a hashing function on the message to compare it with the received signature."
Answer: C
