ABSTRACT
Anonymity networks have been studied for decades, from
both theoretical and practical perspectives.
Several
anonymity systems, such as Tor and Java Anon Proxy
(JAP), have become popular enough for general Internet
users. However, both noticeably constrain the performance
of a user’s network and are considered too complicated for
some users. A new anonymity service, SurfEasy, has cre-
ated a physical device that purports to provide easy, high
performance anonymous network usage. However, the ser-
vice does not readily describe the anonymity system it uses.
In this work, we examine Tor, JAP, and SurfEasy from a
performance and end-user perspective to characterize the
tradeoﬀs in these systems and to provide a guide for ana-
lyzing future anonymity systems. In doing so, we ﬁnd that
SurfEasy does indeed oﬀer better browsing performance in
some cases, but at the cost of robust anonymity.

INTRODUCTION
User privacy is under constant assault on the Internet. Or-
ganizations, such as advertising or analytics providers, use
aggressive tracking techniques to determine the Web sites
users visit and link them to identifying information [10].
While these organizations often leverage this information
solely for marketing purposes, less scrupulous third-parties
could use this information against Web users. In other cases,
repressive governments may attempt to track user activities
to silence political opposition or prosecute individuals ex-
ercising free speech. The extent of such eﬀorts has led the
United States Department of State to sponsor work to create
anti-censorship and anonymity tools [19].
Anonymity can be an attractive goal, be it simply to avoid
being tracked by advertisers to thwarting censorship. Sev-

eral tools aim to provide anonymity. These tools can use
fundamentally diﬀerent techniques. A basic proxy server,
for example, masks an individual’s system from other users,
but allows the proxy to observe all traﬃc and link it back to
the user. The Java Anon Proxy (JAP) [9] project is based
on the concept of Web mixes [3]. With a Web mix, multiple
proxies are chained together so than no single proxy device
can see both the origin and the destination, providing some
degree of protection from malicious proxy server operators.
Another approach, onion routing [11], uses layers of encryp-
tion and redirection to provide strong protections against
detection of an individual. The popular Tor anonymity sys-
tem [18] is based on the onion routing paradigm.
Each of these existing anonymity systems has drawbacks.
A simple proxy allows the proxy operator to gather all the
information about its users and what they are accessing, but
allows greater performance. The JAP and Tor systems ad-
dress this vulnerability, but increase the latency for connec-
tions and decrease the available bandwidth. This is a funda-
mental limitation to these systems: a user’s traﬃc must be
directed through multiple Web mix or onion routing nodes
before going to the destination, which increases latency, and
each node’s bandwidth must be shared by all users of that
node, constraining available bandwidth. Further, despite
developer eﬀorts, some users ﬁnd both JAP and Tor to be
confusing and complicated.
A new commercial product, SurfEasy [14], has been mar-
keted as an easy-to-use anonymity solution for less tech-
savvy users that provides greater performance than compet-
ing approaches [16]. The SurfEasy manufacturers have indi-
cated that they use proxy servers in North America and that
they plan to expand to other continents in the future. How-
ever, they provide no additional technical information about
the service’s infrastructure. With just this vague informa-
tion, it is unclear whether SurfEasy uses a simple proxy
server model, Web mixes across diverse ISPs and national
boundaries, or even onion routing systems. The underlying
technologies can dramatically aﬀect the degree of anonymity,
privacy, and performance the user can expect.
In this work, we provide an approach for evaluating
anonymity systems from a user’s perspective. We use Sur-
fEasy as a motivating example, comparing it to publicly
known properties of the Tor and JAP systems. We analyze
the bandwidth, latency, and network addressing behavior of
each of the systems. In doing so, we ﬁnd that SurfEasy cur-
rently oﬀers lower latency and higher bandwidth than either
of Tor or JAP, yet appears to sacriﬁce anonymity. In par-
ticular, it appears that SurfEasy currently uses only a single
995hop proxy for users, with only two distinct proxy servers ob-
served to be deployed. While SurfEasy’s use of a hardware
component limits our ability to test it as rigorously as Tor
or JAP, which may lead to overly generous performance re-
sults, we believe the SurfEasy infrastructure may be cause
for concern. For users worried about tracking, the SurfEasy
system’s centralized nature also increases the risks for users
to be tracked by the SurfEasy system itself.
2. RELATED WORKS
To our knowledge, no previous work has explored the de-
termination of an anonymity system’s unknown structure.
However, the area of anonymity systems has a long, rich
history, which we now brieﬂy describe. For a more detailed
survey of anonymity systems, we defer to work by Danezis
and Diaz [5], Ren and Wu [12], and Edman and Yener [7].
[11].
Recent anonymity systems have leveraged the concept
of onion routing designed by Reed et al.
Syver-
son et al. [15] performed the ﬁrst quantitative analysis of a
connection-based anonymity system, ﬁnding that the onion
routing design oﬀered greater resistance to traﬃc analysis
than other connection-based systems at the time. Dingle-
dine et al. reﬁned this approach by creating Tor [6]. Other
work focuses on comparing anonymity systems. Rennhard et
al.
[13] performed quantitative performance analysis on
anonymity systems, discussing the trade-oﬀ of usability,
overhead, and privacy protection. Back et al. [1] focused
on comparing the vulnerability to traﬃc analysis to vulner-
ability to denial of service attacks while comparing Free-
dom [8] and PipeNet [4]. Before creating their work on Web
MIXes [3], Berthold et al. [2] compared a series of anonymity
systems to scope their objectives.
This work continues exploring anonymity systems by ex-
amining a new commercial system using previously explored
systems as a baseline. However, unlike prior work, we do not
have the advantage of knowing the technical details of the
infrastructure used by the commercial system and thus must
infer its architecture based on user-observable traits.
3. METHODOLOGY
We examine Tor, JAP, and SurfEasy from a user’s per-
spective, considering only properties that can be explored
at the source and destination systems.
In particular, we
examine the latency and throughput of the systems, along
with the IP address diversity observed.
To explore the anonymity systems from a variety of
sources, we use PlanetLab [17], a global network of systems.
We used 12 PlanetLab nodes located in 10 countries. We
used probes from each of these machines every ﬁve min-
utes during 39 one-hour sessions between April 5 and April
11, 2012, for a total duration of approximately 20 hours
per system over 6 days. Unfortunately, we were unable to
use PlanetLab for the SurfEasy system due to the system’s
implementation. SurfEasy uses a USB device that is only
compatible with Windows and Mac OS. Accordingly, Sur-
fEasy is incompatible with PlanetLab due to hardware and
operating system constraints. Accordingly, our experiments
with SurfEasy will be performed on a laptop on two diﬀerent
networks: a residential ISP connection (which had a 3Mbps
downstream and a 768Kbps upstream) and from a university
LAN. To achieve a controlled testing environment, SurfEasy
is tested on a Windows XP virtual machine.
For Tor, JAP, and SurfEasy, we use packet capture soft-
ware to record all network traﬃc at the source system. The
SurfEasy system uses a customized version of the Mozilla
Firefox Web browser. For consistency, we also use Fire-
fox in our experiments with Tor and JAP. Since SurfEasy
oﬀers no conﬁguration options for creating its anonymous
connections, to improve its usability, we will likewise only
use the default settings in Tor and JAP. However, we mod-
ify Firefox for Tor, JAP, and SurfEasy to load the iMacros
extension. This extension allows the browser to be driven in
an automated manner, allowing us to automatically control
each of the PlanetLab nodes with Firefox instances to ob-
tain more systematic results. We additionally used iMacros
for the SurfEasy system for consistency, even though it was
not part of a distributed system.
Our packet captures software allowed us to record each of
the IP addresses in the anonymity network that interacted
with the source machines. We used a number of Web sites
that echo back the IP address of the connecting Web client.
By recording the web page output of these sites, we can dis-
