I can see support for users and different roles in superset. But What I need
is, Consider, I have a set of dashboards for finance department. Only that
department's members can view the dashboards and for any other departments, it
should be restricted.
I know we can restrict the dashboard access very easily, But One solution I
need is to create a group with all the members I have and to add that group as
a single user, while creating Rules and Users in Apache Superset.
One alternate solution is to create a Role as we want and add one or more
users easily.
But adding multiple number of users to multiple number of Roles is pretty
difficult (Based on which department they belong to). So that the idea is to
create a group for each group of Users and sharing dashboard to that group.
