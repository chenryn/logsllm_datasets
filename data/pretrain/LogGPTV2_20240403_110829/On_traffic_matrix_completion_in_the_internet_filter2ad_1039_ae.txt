ﬂowing through the observer, and so links in that case were
analogous to customer-provider links. In contrast, in the AS
graph, trafﬁc between two peers of the observer does not ﬂow
through the observer, because peers do not transit trafﬁc for
other peers.
This suggests that we should separate a node’s degree into
two components: the number of customer links, and the num-
ber of peer links.3 This separation is shown in Figure 10,
which plots customer degree against peer degree across the
highest-degree ASes. The ﬁgure shows that high-degree ASes
tend to fall into two different groups (shown in circles): some
have more customer links than peer links, while others have
more peer links than customer links.
Thus, it makes sense to analyze these two groups separately.
If our analysis based on Proposition 3.3 is correct, ASes with
high customer degree should show increased TM completion
ability, while those with high peer degree should not necessar-
ily show high completion ability.
This is in fact conﬁrmed by our results, which are shown in
Figure 11. Figure 11(a) shows TM completion ability versus
the number of peers of the observer AS. There is no strong
relationship between number of peers and completion ability;
in fact the ASes with the greatest number of peers (more than
100) all have quite poor completion ability. In the ﬁgure, the
red diamonds correspond to those ASes with the highest num-
ber of customers; it can be seen that these are the ASes with
the greatest completion ability, but which typically have inter-
mediate peer degree.
We can understand this difference by examing the inﬂu-
ence of customers and peers on the visibility matrix of the
3The number of provider links per AS in our data is usually
quite small and we ignore them in this analysis.

Since centrality per se is not a strong indicator of comple-
tion ability, we turn to the analyses in Section 3 to guide our
intuition. Proposition 3.3 showed that increasing the degree of
a node can increase its TM completion ability. The relation-
ship between degree and TM completion ability is shown in
Figures 9(c) and 9(d). The ﬁgures show that degree is a much
better predictor of completion ability than centrality.
However, close examination of Figures 9(c) shows that some
of the very highest-degree ASes have poor completion ability.
Further consideration of the implications of Proposition 3.3
suggest an explanation that sharpens our understanding. The
proposition was based on the assumption of shortest-path rout-
ing, and so does not directly apply to the AS graph. In partic-
ular, in the AS graph, a link may be between customer and
provider, or it may be between two peers. The topology con-
sidered in Proposition 3.3 resulted in trafﬁc between nodes

observer AS. We do this by examining how many knowns (vis-
ible ﬂows) are contributed to an observer AS on average by a
customer and by a peer, for the set of ASes in Figure 11(a).
Figure 11(b) shows a histogram of this quantity for customers,
and Figure 11(c) shows the result for peers. The histograms
show that often, a customer provides a highly dense column of
the visibility matrix, while a peer typically provides very few
entries in the visibility matrix. In particular, a single-parent
stub customer provides a complete column.
In this regard, it is also important to note that improving
completion ability is not simply a matter of maximizing the
number of visible elements in the AS’s trafﬁc matrix. It is im-
portant where in the matrix the visible elements appear.
In
general, it is better for visible elements to be broadly dis-
tributed across columns and rows of the matrix. To demon-
strate this fact, we select a set of 9 ASes with comparable den-
sity of visible elements — all ASes for which the number of
visible elements lies in the range (4 ×105, 6 ×105). To char-
acterize the dispersion of visible elements we measure their
entropy across columns. That is, for a matrix M of size m ×n,
Cj
we compute E = −∑n
N ) where Cj is the total num-
ber of knowns in column j and N is the total number of knowns
in the entire matrix.
The relationship between entropy and expected rank for the
9 ASes is shown in Figure 12. When this entropy measure is
large, visible elements are dispersed throughout the columns,
while when it is small, visible elements are concentrated in
few columns. The ﬁgure shows that ASes with very similar
numbers of visible ﬂows can vary considerably in their com-
pletion ability, and that completion ability is much better when
visible elements are spread widely across the columns of the
matrix.
In summary, our results in this section conﬁrm key elements
of our analysis from the previous section. In particular, our
results point to the importance of having customers as a re-
source for TM completion. Further, we ﬁnd that ASes best
at TM completion are not generally those with a large num-
ber of peers, nor do they tend to be in the innermost, densest-
connected k-shell.

5. WHICH ELEMENTS CAN BE
RECOVERED?
While the results in the last section focused on comparing
ASes globally across the Internet, we now turn to questions
that are speciﬁc to individual ASes. Since a given AS may
only be able to recover some of its invisible elements, it is
important to develop an understanding of which elements are
most readily estimated.
To capture the relationship between an AS and a ﬂow that
is invisible to that AS, we deﬁne a metric for distance between
an AS and a ﬂow. Figure 13 illustrates how ﬂow distances are
computed. For any given AS and ﬂow, we ﬁnd the shortest-
path distance in the AS graph between the observer AS and
each AS that the ﬂow passes through. The distance between
the AS and ﬂow is the minimum of these shortest path dis-
tances. Of course, the distance to a known ﬂow is zero.
To get a sense of typical distance values, we measure the
distribution of distances across all (AS,ﬂow) pairs. The result
is shown in Figure 14. The ﬁgure shows that around 60% of
unknown ﬂows are distance 2 away from the observer ASes.
Distances 1 and 3 follow by 30% and 10%, respectively; the
percentage of unknowns that are further away is negligible.
Thus, most unknown ﬂows are at least two hops away from
the observer AS.
Our ﬁrst set of results characterizes the distance to ﬂows
that can be recovered, aggregating across all ASes. Figure 15
shows the fraction of unknown ﬂows that can be recovered at

each hop distance for varying rank values. At all rank values,
the ﬂows that ASes recover are primarily at distance 1. Only at
rank 1 is there a non-negligible amount of ﬂows recovered at
distance 2 (despite the fact that distance 2 ﬂows are much more
numerous, as shown in Figure 14). The percentage of recov-
ered unknowns at hop distance 3 and greater is negligible at
any rank. These results show that there is a strong relationship
between the distances to a particular ﬂow and the potential to
recover the ﬂow. In particular, the unknown ﬂows that an ob-
server AS is most likely to recover are those that pass through
its direct neighbors.
An important set of questions from a business intelligence
standpoint concerns the ability of one AS (a predictor) to infer
the set of ﬂows that pass through some other particular AS (a
target). We call this targeted TM completion. For example,
consider the case described in the Introduction: an ISP may
wish to know how much business a competitor is doing with a
prospective customer. In this case the ﬁrst ISP is the predictor
and its competitor is the target.
To understand the ability of an AS to do targeted TM com-
pletion, we consider pairs of (predictor, target) ASes. Each
pair has an associated hop distance in the AS graph. After
constructing all such pairs and measuring their distance, we
randomly sample 500 pairs at each distance. We then measure
the fraction of the ﬂows visible in the target that were ﬁlled-in
during TM completion in the predictor. That is, let V be the
set of elements visible in the target, U the set of unknown (in-
visible) ﬂows in the predictor, and R the set of recovered ﬂows
in the predictor. Then for every pair we compute the fraction
frac = |V ∩R|/|V ∩U|.
The results are shown in Figure 16 as a CDF across all 500
pairs at each hop distance. The ﬁgure shows that for pairs at
hop distance 2 or 3, very little targeted completion is possible
– in more than 95% of such cases, no targeted completion can
be performed. However the situation is quite different for hop
distance 1, which corresponds to ASes that are adjacent in the
AS graph. In that case, only 45% of predictors cannot do any
targeted completion. Most predictors can do some targeted
completion, and for 19% of the predictors, all of their target’s
ﬂows can be recovered. Thus, if an AS wishes to do targeted
completion, its best targets are its neighbors.
While an AS’s neighbors make the best targets, it is impor-
tant to note that an AS can have a variety of different kinds

vide pairs into these three groups and examine the same metric
as before (fraction of target unknowns completed). In the CP
group, the predictor seeks to estimate ﬂows passing through
its provider; in the PC group, the predictor seeks to estimate
