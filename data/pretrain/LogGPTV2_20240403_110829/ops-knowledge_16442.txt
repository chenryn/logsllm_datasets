User: I'm trying to install psycopg2, using pip, on Fedora.
I get the message:
"pg_config executable not found."
In ubuntu, this problem can be resolved by installing the libpq-dev and python-dev packages.  There's no clear analogous solution in Fedora.
Assistant: You are probably searching python-devel and postgresql-devel packages.
