Figure 3: Reporting a successful attempt. The ﬁgure shows an example of a generic script instantiated
with an attack trace. First we deﬁne the generic script, which encompasses the stages of all attacks. In the
example, they are: enter the building, enter the oﬃce, identify and get the asset, and exit the building. For
each step in a trace, we identify both the mechanisms (if any) that were circumvented and mechanisms that
stopped an attack. For failed attacks, the table shows which mechanisms were circumvented up to the failed
action, and the mechanism that successfully stopped the attempt.
1. Social engineer night pass from an employee.
2. Enter the building early in the morning.
3. Social engineer the cleaning lady to access the oﬃce.
4. Cut any protection on the laptop using a bolt cutter.
5. Leave the building during oﬃce hours.
Figure 4: Example of an attack scenario
When the penetration test starts, the tester ﬁrst scouts
the area and proposes a set of attack scenarios (5 in Figure
2). An example of an attack scenario is presented in Figure
4. The proposed attack scenarios need to be approved ﬁrst
by the custodian (6 in Figure 2) and then by the security
oﬃcer (7 in Figure 2). The custodian is directly involved in
the test and can correctly judge the eﬀect of the scenario on
her daily tasks and the tasks of her colleagues. The security
oﬃcer needs to approve the scenarios because she is aware
of the general security of the organization and can better
predict the far-reaching consequences of the actions of the
tester.
If the custodian or the security oﬃcer disapprove an attack
scenario, they need to evaluate the scenario and estimate the
success. The tester puts in the report that the scenario was
proposed, the reasons why the scenario was turned down
and the opinion of all three roles on the success of the sce-
nario.
In this way the scenario although not executed, it
is documented including the judgment on the eﬀectiveness
of the attack by the security oﬃcer, the custodian and the
tester.
After approval from the custodian and the security oﬃcer,
the tester starts with the execution of the attack scenarios (8
in Figure 2). The custodian and the security oﬃcer remotely
monitor the execution (9 in Figure 2) through CCTV and
the monitoring equipment installed by the custodian.
The penetration tester needs to install wearable monitor-
ing equipment to log her actions. The logs serve three pur-
poses. First, they ensure that if an employee is treated with
disrespect there is objective evidence. Second, the logs prove
that the penetration tester has followed the attack scenar-
ios, and ﬁnally, the logs provide information how the mech-
anisms were circumvented, helping the organization repeat
the scenario if needed.
4.4 Closure
After the end of the test, the penetration tester prepares
a report containing a list of attack traces. Each attack trace
contains information of successful or unsuccessful attacks
(10 in Figure 2). Based on the report, the security oﬃcer
debriefs both the custodians and any deceived employees
during the test (11 in Figure 2).
Reporting. The attack traces are structured in a report
that emphasizes the weak and the strong security mecha-
nisms encountered during the penetration test, structured
following 25 techniques for situational crime prevention [11].
For diﬀerent domains there are extensive lists of security
mechanisms to enforce the 25 techniques (for example, [12]).
The combination of the attack traces together with the situ-
ational crime prevention techniques gives an overview of the
circumvented mechanisms [13] (Figure 3)
Debrieﬁng the employees and the custodian. After ﬁnding
they were deceived by the same organization they work for,
the employees might get disappointed or disgruntled. At
the end of the test the security oﬃcer fully debriefs the cus-
todian and the employees. The debrieﬁng should be done
carefully, to maintain or restore the trust between custodian
and the employees who helped the tester to gain the asset.
4.5 Validation
To test the usability of the physical penetration tests using
social engineering on the employees, we executed a series
of penetration tests following the EF methodology. These
pilots allowed us to gain a clear, ﬁrst-hand picture of each
execution stage of the methodology, and draw observations
from the experience.
To avoid bias in the execution of the tests, we did not
perform the tests ourselves, but recruited three teams of
students who were in their ﬁrst year of master studies to
steal three laptops from the custodian (the ﬁrst author).
We locked the laptops with Kensington locks and hid the
keys in an oﬃce desk. To monitor the laptops, we installed
motion detection web cameras which streamed live feeds to
an Internet server. Since the custodian shares the oﬃce with
four other colleagues, the cameras were positioned in such
a way to preserve the privacy of the colleagues. We told
the colleagues we are doing an experiment, but we did not
reveal the nature nor the goal of the experiment.
Since we knew about the penetration test, we did not
allow the students to gain possession of the laptops in our
presence. During the experiment, we carried on the normal
work, thus the students were forced to carry on the attacks
after working hours or during the lunch break.
The three teams scouted the building and wrote a list of
attack scenarios they want to execute. Eventually, all three
teams successfully obtained the target laptop and wrote the
successful and unsuccessful attempts in the format shown
in Figure 3. After the penetration test, we individually de-
briefed the security oﬃcer, the security guard, the secretary
and the colleagues.
4.6 Lessons learned from the penetration tests
The observations are result of our experience with the
penetration tests using qualitative social research and might
not generalize to other social environments. However, the
observations provide an insight of the issues that arose while
using the methodology in practice.
The attack scenarios should be ﬂexible. Although the stu-
dents provided scenarios prior to all attacks, in all cases
they were forced to deviate from them, because the target
employee was either not present or was not behaving as ex-
pected. Attack scenarios assure the custodian and the secu-
rity oﬃcer that the actions of the penetration tester are in
the scope of the test, but at the same time there should be
some freedom in adapting the script to the circumstances.
The methodology does not respect the trust relationship
between the custodian and the employees. After the pene-
tration test, the custodian knows which employees were de-
ceived, and the trust relationship between them is disturbed.
For example, if the secretary lets the penetration tester into
the oﬃce of the custodian, the custodian might not be able
to trust her again.
During the penetration test, separating the custodian from
the employees is hard. Whenever the students approached a
colleague from the oﬃce, the ﬁrst reaction of the colleague
was to call the custodian and ask for guidance. This led to
uncomfortable situations where we were forced to shut down
our phones and ignore e-mails while outside the oﬃce.
Debrieﬁng proved to be diﬃcult. After the test, we fully
disclosed the test to all involved employees. Debrieﬁng the
security guard who opened the oﬃce for the penetration
testers three times was the hardest. During the debrieﬁng
we focused on the beneﬁts of the penetration test to the
university and their help setting up the test. After the de-
brieﬁng, we concluded that we caused more stress to the
guard during the debrieﬁng than the students had caused
during the penetration test.
5. CUSTODIAN-FOCUSED METHOD
In the EF methodology, the custodian is aware of the pen-
etration test. The knowledge of the penetration test changes
her normal behavior and thus inﬂuences the results of the
test. Since the asset belongs to the custodian, and the as-
set is in the oﬃce of the custodian, in many environments
it is desirable to include the custodian’s resistance to social
engineering as part of the test.
After performing the ﬁrst series of penetration tests, we
revisited and expanded the environment-focused methodol-
ogy. The CF methodology can be seen as a reﬁnement of the
EF methodology, based on the experience from the ﬁrst set
of penetration tests. In the CF methodology the custodian
is not aware of the test, making the methodology suitable
for penetration tests where the goal is to check the overall
security of an area including the level of security awareness
of the custodian.
5.1 Actors
There are six actors in the CF methodology.
Security oﬃcer - an employee responsible for the security
of the organization.
Coordinator - an employee or contractor responsible for
the experiment and the behavior of the penetration tester.
The coordinator orchestrates the whole penetration test.
Penetration tester - an employee or contractor who at-
tempts to gain possession of the asset without being caught.
Contact person - an employee who provides logistic sup-
port in the organization and a person to be contacted in case
of an emergency.
Custodian - an employee at whose oﬃce the asset resides.
The custodian should not be aware of the penetration test
(1 in Figure 5).
Employee - person in the organization who has none of
the roles above. The employee should not be aware of the
penetration test (2 in Figure 5).
Figure 6: Actors in the CF methodology
Figure 6 shows the actors and the relations between them.
In this methodology, the penetration tester deceives both,
the employees and the custodian. Moreover, the contact
person also needs to deceive the custodian. These relations

are discussed in greater depth in section 6.
5.2 Setup
At the beginning, similar to the EF methodology, the se-
curity oﬃcer initializes the test by deﬁning the target, scope
and the rules of engagement. The security oﬃcer at this
point assigns a coordinator for the penetration test and pro-
vides the coordinator with marked assets and equipment for
monitoring the assets (3 in Figure 5). The marked assets
should be similar to the asset of interest for which the se-
curity is measured. The monitoring equipment should be
non-intrusive and its purpose is to have additional informa-
tion on the activities of the penetration tester.
The penetration tester should sign the rules of engage-
ment (Appendix A) before the start of the execution stage
(4 in Figure 5). The coordinator selects a number of con-
tact people and provides them with the marked assets and
the monitoring equipment (5 in Figure 5). Furthermore, the
coordinator provides a cover story which explains why the
custodian is given the asset. The contact person selects a
number of custodians based on the requirements from the
security oﬃcer (random, speciﬁc roles, speciﬁc characteris-
tics) and distributes the marked assets and the monitoring
equipment to the custodians. After giving the monitoring
equipment, the contact person should get a signed informed
consent (Appendix B) from the custodians (6 in Figure 5).
If the asset can store data, the document must clearly state
that the custodian should not store any sensitive nor pri-
vate data in the asset. Before the penetration test starts,
the coordinator distributes a list of penetration testers to
the security oﬃcer, and a list of asset locations to the pen-
etration tester (7 in Figure 5).
5.3 Execution
The ﬁrst steps of the execution stage are similar to the
previous methodology. The penetration tester scouts the
area and proposes attack scenarios (8 in Figure 5). The
coordinator and later the security oﬃcer should agree with
these scenarios before the tester starts executing them (9
and 10 in Figure 5). After approval from both actors, the
tester starts executing the attack scenarios. If a penetration
tester is caught or a termination condition is reached, the
penetration tester immediately informs the contact person.
Thus, if the custodian stored sensitive data in the asset, the
data is not exposed.
When the tester gains possession of the target asset, she
informs the contact person and the coordinator and returns
the asset to the contact person (11 in Figure 5). The contact
person collects the monitoring equipment and informs the
security oﬃcer (12 in Figure 5). If the tester gains posses-
sion of the asset without the knowledge of the custodian, the
contact person needs to reach the custodian before the cus-
todian reaches the oﬃce and explain to the custodian that
the test is terminated. The security oﬃcer obtains surveil-
lance videos from the CCTV and access logs and gives them
to the coordinator (13 in Figure 5).
5.4 Closure
After the execution stage, the penetration tester writes
a report of all attempts, both failed and successful, in the
form of attack traces and gives them to the coordinator (14
in Figure 5). The coordinator has two tasks. First, she
collects the marked assets and monitoring equipment from
the contact person (15 in Figure 5) and returns them to the
security oﬃcer. Second, the coordinator debriefs the security
oﬃcer and the custodians and provides the custodian a form
of reward for helping in the assessment (16 in Figure 5).
Not all employees that were social engineered should be
debriefed. Employees who were treated with respect and
to whom the penetration tester did not cause discomfort
during the interaction should not be debriefed, because the
debrieﬁng can cause more stress than the interaction with

The decision which employees need
to be debriefed lies with the security oﬃcer, and is based
on the logs from the penetration tester and the monitoring
equipment. The criteria on which employees need to be
debriefed are presented in greater detail in Section 6.
Debrieﬁng the custodians. All custodians should be de-
briefed, because they sign an informed consent at the be-
ginning of the test. However, to preserve the trust between
the custodian and the employees, the custodian should not
know which employee contributed to the attack.
Three elements should be considered before the debrief-
ing. First, the custodians were deceived by the organization
they work for (more speciﬁcally, by the contact person). Sec-
ond, in case of direct interaction, their privacy might be
violated by the logging equipment from the tester. Third,
they might be stressed from the penetration test either di-
rectly, through interaction with the penetration tester, or
indirectly, by ﬁnding their asset is gone before the contact
person reaches them.
The debrieﬁng should focus on the contribution of the
custodian in ﬁnding the security vulnerabilities in the or-
ganization, and the custodian should be rewarded for the
participation.
5.5 Validation
We orchestrated eleven penetration tests with the custodian-
focused methodology. As targets we used eleven marked lap-
tops that just came out on the market. We selected three
PhD students as contact persons, who chose eleven friends
as custodians (snowball sampling [14]). The custodians were
ten PhD students and one professor spread across two uni-
versities, in nine diﬀerent buildings.
We gave the laptops to the custodians for two weeks us-
age. The cover story was that the universities are interested
in the usability of the new generation of laptops. Thus, we
needed to monitor the behavior of the custodian and mea-
sure their satisfaction level. The contact persons explained
that they cannot tell the custodians exactly which behavior
we measure, since it might change the results of the exper-
iment. We instructed the custodians to lock the laptops
with a Kensington lock and to keep them in the oﬃce. To
reduce the risk of data leakage and loss of productivity, we
asked the custodians not to store any private or work data
on the laptops. Later, thirty-three master students in com-
puter security, divided in eleven teams of three, tried to gain
possession of the laptops by using physical and social means.
Figure 7: Recording from the validation of the EF method-
ology. The student provided to the janitor a fake email stat-
ing he needs to collect a laptop from the custodian oﬃce. The
janitor let the student into the oﬃce and helped him ﬁnd the
key from the Kensington lock.
Figure 8: Recording from the validation of the CF method-
ology. The student went to the oﬃce early in the morning,
disguised as an employee who forgot his key. The cleaning
lady let the student in. The student used a bolt cutter to
remove the Kensington lock.
The students took roles as service desk employees, stu-
dents that urgently needed a laptop for a few hours or co-
ordinator representatives. The students used mobile phones
and pocket video cameras to record the conversation with
the employees. In one case they took a professional camera
and a cameraman, and told the custodian the recording is
part of a study to measure the service quality of the service
desk.
The resistance of the employees varied. In ﬁve cases, the
employees gave the laptop easily after being showed a fake
email and being promised they will get the laptop back in
a few hours.
In two cases the custodian wanted a conﬁr-
mation from a supervisor or the coordinator. In one case a
colleague of the custodian got suspicious and sent an email
to the campus security. Since only the main security oﬃcer
knew about the penetration test, in few hours the security
guards were all alerted and started searching for suspicious
students.
