Question: A colleague argues that to avoid costly damages from undetected attacks, it's best to have an intrusion detection system with a 0% false negative rate. How would you counter this argument based on the concepts of false positives and false negatives?
"A": "A system with a 0% false negative rate will report an attack every time and never miss an actual attack, but it would result in an unmanageable number of false alerts.",
"B": "A 0% false negative rate is highly desirable as it ensures maximum security, even if it means more resources are spent on investigating false alerts.",
"C": "It's impossible to achieve a 0% false negative rate without compromising on other aspects of the detection system, like its ability to handle high volumes of requests.",
"D": "Having a 0% false negative rate would lead to a detector that never triggers an alarm, thus no false alerts to worry about."
Answer: A
