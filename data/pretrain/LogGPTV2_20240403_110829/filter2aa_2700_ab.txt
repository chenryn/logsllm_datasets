Crowd-Sourced Bounties – Pointers 
• Due to risk of duplicates, speed is more of a 
factor than other types of bug bounties to 
ensure decent ROI. 
• Many provide a heads-up on when a new 
bounty starts – be ready to begin ASAP. 
• When finding a vulnerability, quickly create a 
PoC, a short write-up, and then report it 
immediately.  
– Don’t wait or you end up with kudos instead of 
cool cash! 
Brokers –  
Better Approach? 
N O T   J U S T   S E C U R I T Y  ,    T H E   R I G H T   S E C U R I T Y  
• Researchers who find vulnerabilities,  work with a 
broker to find the best market and price to sell 
the information. 
• Could be a number of avenues, including Gray and 
Black Markets. 
• Generally thought to be the way to get the most 
money possible for your research. 
• In almost all cases, reporting and coordination is 
directly with the broker only who handles the 
who transaction. 
• Details of the vulnerabilty are never to be 
published.

Bug Bounties Have Rules & More To Come! 
• Rules/requirements may not be as clear as they 
”should be”  
– What is considered a valid submission 
– Restrictions/limitations 
– How are duplicate reports handled 
– How should it be reported 
– What information should be included 
– What is the expected response time 
• Very clear rules of engagement 
– Testing live sites and production customer profiles
