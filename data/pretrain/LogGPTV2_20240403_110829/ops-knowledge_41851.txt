User: OS:  Fedora 21
Python:  2.7.6
I run a python script as root or using sudo it runs fine.  If I run it as just the user I get the following:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/user/dev_ad_list.py", line 12, in 
     import ldap
  ImportError: No module named ldap

selinux=disabled   --  What other security is preventing a user from running a python script that imports ldap
Assistant: Path to python was different than other user.  User was pointing to canopy.
