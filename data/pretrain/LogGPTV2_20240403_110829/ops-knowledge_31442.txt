User: How to build a multi-container application using Docker Compose? Please give relevant configuration files and operation commands.
Assistant: Docker Compose is an official tool provided by Docker for managing multi-Docker container applications. You can use YAML files to define configurations such as services, networks, and mounted volumes of applications, and use Docker Compose commands to start, stop, and manage applications. The following is an example of using Docker Compose to build a multi-container application, which contains two services: a web application and a MySQL database. 1. Create Dockerfile The Dockerfile for the web application is as follows: ``` FROM python:3 WORKDIR /app COPY requirements.txt . RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt COPY . . EXPOSE 5000 CMD [ "python" , "./app.py" ] ``` The Dockerfile of the MySQL database is as follows: ``` FROM mysql:5.7 ENV MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root COPY init.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ EXPOSE 3306 ``` 2. Write docker-compose.yaml file ``` version: '3' services: web: build: . ports: - "5000:5000" depends_on: - db db: build: context: ./mysql environment: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root restart: always ports: - "3306:3306" ``` 3. Use the Docker Compose command to start the application After defining the Docker Compose file, you can use the following command to start the application: ``` docker-compose up ``` After using the above command, the application It will start automatically, and Docker Compose will automatically build and deploy multiple containers. 4. Use the Docker Compose command to stop the application To stop the application, you can use the following command: ``` docker-compose down ``` After using the above command, Docker Compose will automatically stop and delete all resources such as containers, networks, and data volumes.
