i.e., the signed difference equal to the positive clock- or negative
counterclockwise arc length from 𝑡 to 𝑠 taking values in [−𝑝, 𝑝].
The circular distance between 𝑠 and 𝑡 with values in [0, 𝑝] is
𝑑𝑝(𝑠, 𝑡) ≔ |𝛿𝑝(𝑠, 𝑡)|.
Note that the circular mean is highly sensitive to a change in
the input: We can always construct a sequence 𝑡1 . . . , 𝑡𝑁 so that
changing a single 𝑡𝑖 will also cause the mean to point into the
opposite direction. For instance, given a circle with period 2𝜋, let
(𝑡1, 𝑡2, 𝑡3) = (𝛼, 𝜋 − 𝛼,± 𝜋
2 ) for some small 𝛼 > 0. Therefore, we
obtain the same sensitivity Δ∡ = 𝜋 in the central and local model.
Local model advantage and sample complexity. Note that the
4.2.1
central model normally has a lower sensitivity, so it injects less
noise and hence is more accurate than the local model. However, in
case of the circular mean, we anticipate an advantage for the local
model: Given a sufficient amount of noisy responses, the locally
injected noise will gradually cancel out, resulting in more accurate
statistics than in the central model. This is similar to the mean of
i.i.d. Gaussians which has a lower variance than each Gaussian on
its own. Moreover, the local model can be used in scenarios where
the data curator cannot be or is not trusted by the participants.
To examine this effect in case of the circular (and spherical) mean,
we perform the following simulation experiment to determine the
number of samples required to reach a certain accuracy: Let 𝑡𝑖,𝑗 (cid:123) P
denote i.i.d. samples from a circular distribution P with mean 𝜇 = 0

for 𝜅 ≈ 2
𝜋 (i.e. 𝜖 = 𝜅Δ∡ ≈ 2). The behavior of wrapped distributions
thus causes utility worse than a uniform distribution.
For polls like the NSF survey, the impact is significant: To reach
an error below 0.1 with 𝜖 = 1.0, the service provider only needs to
collect about 750 responses with Purkayastha instead of over 3600
with Wrapped Laplace, which represents an over 4.8-fold reduction.
Conversely, given the same number of responses, our mechanisms
achieve lower errors and higher accuracy as we see in the next
Section 4.2.2. This makes the use of local DP practical under stricter
conditions even with small privacy parameters 𝜖 ≤ 10.
Sleep study: average wake times and ranking statistics. In the
4.2.2
following experiments, we simulate a privacy-preserving survey in
a real-world setting, in both the central and local privacy model.
Dataset description. We rely on the NSF’s 2011 dataset [14],
which includes a total of 1,508 survey responses. The questions
include their bed and wake times, both on workdays and weekends.
The respondents are divided into four age groups: Baby Boomers
(46-64), Generation X (30-45), Y (19-29), and Z (13-18 years).
Sanitization procedure and parameters. To sanitize the times-of-
day reported in the survey on a 24-hour scale, we need to express
them as 2-dimensional unit vectors that we can use as mode of
the VMF or Purkayastha distribution. This is easily achieved by
assigning to each hour the corresponding angle (in radians) on a
24-hour clock, and then transforming these angles to coordinates
via sine and cosine. Conversely, after perturbing the points with
one of our new mechanisms, we transform the points back to the
24-hour scale using the inverse trigonometric arctangent function.
For comparison, we also perturb the scalar data directly on the 24-
hour scale by means of the standard Laplace mechanism [10]. Since
Laplace noise can be arbitrarily positive or negative, we reduce
the perturbed values modulo 24 to map the values back into the
domain [0, 24). In fact, this corresponds to a WL distribution on a
24-hour scale, as discussed in Section 3.6.1.
Let 𝒕 = (𝑡1, . . . , 𝑡𝑁) be the true times-of-day from the 𝑁 partic-
ipants. Depending on the privacy model, we proceed as follows:
In the central model, we take the average ¯𝑡 = ∅24(𝒕) of all truly
reported times, and then perturb ¯𝑡 using one of the privacy mecha-
nisms. In the local model, we first perturb each participant’s value
𝑡𝑖 individually. Then, we compute the average from the perturbed
values. The 𝑑∡-sensitivity of the circular mean is Δ∡ = 𝜋 radians,
corresponding to 12 hours, even in the central model as changing a
single input can cause the mean to flip to the opposite direction in
the worst case. For VMF, we can also use the smaller 𝑑2-sensitivity
Δ2 = 2 corresponding to the diameter of the unit circle.
For each mechanism, VMF, Purkayastha, and Laplace, we vary
the privacy parameter 𝜖 ∈ {10𝑘 | −4 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 3} with step size Δ𝑘 =
0.2. To stabilize the results, we repeat this procedure in each setting
(privacy model, mechanism, and parameters) for 𝑅 = 10000 runs, so
we obtain a sequence ˜𝒕 = (˜𝑡1, . . . , ˜𝑡𝑅) of anonymized average times.
Error evaluation for circular mean. We take each anonymized
time ˜𝑡𝑖, whose mean we denote by ˜𝑡 = ∅24(˜𝒕), as estimate for the
true average time ¯𝑡. We want to estimate the error induced by the
various privacy mechanisms on the average wake time compared
