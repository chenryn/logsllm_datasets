User: I want to share some modules between a python GAE project, and another python project but want to use the same source files so that I can change them without having to worry about keeping the source files in each project up to date.
Is there a way to let two python projects share the same source files outside of their root? Also let GAE know which source files exist outside of the source tree so it deploys them to the server. I'm using PyDev on Eclipse.
Assistant: IF your dev environment is linux, you can use symlinks in your project folder to the shared source.  The deployment will treat the symlinks as actual files/folders.
