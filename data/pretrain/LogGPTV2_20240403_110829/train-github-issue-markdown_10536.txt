We should change this:
`import { some-module } from 'some-lib'`
To this:
`from 'some-lib' import {some-module}`
If we change to the second, the IDE can help us out by auto-completing the
modules which we can import. In the first case we still can do it, but it's
unnatural, we have to type everything and then come back.
