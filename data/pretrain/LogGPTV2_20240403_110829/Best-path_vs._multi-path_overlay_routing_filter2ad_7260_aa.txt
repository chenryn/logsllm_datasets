## Abstract

The Internet often experiences packet delivery disruptions due to time-varying congestion and failures caused by software, hardware, and configuration errors. Many approaches to mitigating these issues involve using multiple paths between two network locations. These methods typically assume that the problems on different paths are uncorrelated in time, which is a key requirement for their effectiveness.

This paper investigates the validity of this assumption by analyzing 14 days of data collected from 30 nodes in the RON testbed. We focus on two primary issues: congestion-triggered loss and path failures. Our findings indicate that the probability of losing two packets between the same hosts is nearly as high when sent through an intermediate node (60%) as when they are sent back-to-back on the same path (70%). We also compare two strategies for leveraging path redundancy: mesh routing based on packet replication and reactive routing based on adaptive path selection.

## 1. Introduction

The Internet's routing infrastructure does not guarantee loss-free packet delivery between endpoints. End-to-end transfers frequently experience packet losses due to various reasons, including network congestion, path failures, and routing anomalies. Applications and transport protocols must cope with these losses, often through retransmissions and rate adjustments, leading to degraded throughput and increased latency. Internet paths can experience outages lasting several minutes, causing ongoing data transfers to abort.

In recent years, both IP-layer routing optimizations and overlay networks have been proposed to improve the resilience of packet delivery under challenging conditions. These approaches either find the best single path or send data redundantly along multiple paths. For these techniques to be effective, it is essential that losses and failures on different network paths are uncorrelated. Specifically, a failure on one path should not coincide with failures on all other paths.

Mesh routing, which duplicates packets along different paths, is the simplest way to add redundancy. It incurs overhead due to redundant packets but does not require additional probing. When paths are disjoint, mesh routing is resilient to the failure of any proper subset of its component paths. In this paper, we examine the behavior of mesh routing over an overlay network and assess the degree to which its packets are lost independently.

Reactive routing, implemented with overlay networks, involves constant probing of the paths between nodes. Packets are sent either directly via the Internet or forwarded through a sequence of other nodes in the overlay if the latter path offers better performance. The overhead in this approach comes from both probes and overlay routing traffic. Probes ensure that traffic is rerouted appropriately when the current path degrades or a better path becomes available.

We analyze 14 days of probes between 30 geographically diverse nodes in the RON testbed. These probes include back-to-back packets to determine the correlation of failures and losses on the Internet. Using this data, we evaluate the performance of reactive and mesh routing, comparing their loss rates and latency reductions to the direct Internet path between pairs of nodes.

Our key findings are:
- The conditional loss probability of back-to-back packets is high both when sent on the same path (70%) and when sent via different paths (60%).
- The likelihood of simultaneous failures on multiple paths between a source and destination is high and seems to have increased in 2003 compared to 2002.
- The overall packet loss rate between our hosts is 0.42%. Reactive routing reduces this to 0.33%, and mesh routing reduces it to 0.26%. These improvements primarily come from reducing losses during higher-loss periods.
- Mesh-based routing and reactive routing exploit different network properties and can be used together for increased benefits.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1. Reliable Transmission

Traditional methods to mask packet losses include retransmissions and forward error correction (FEC). Retransmissions are suitable for end-to-end protocols but can interfere with TCP's retransmission timers. FEC adds redundant information to the data stream, allowing reconstruction at the receiver even if some information is missing. While FEC is commonly used in wireless systems, it is also applied in multicast and content distribution systems to protect against packet loss.

### 2.2. Improved Routing

Early ARPANET routing aimed to optimize path selection for congestion but was removed for scalability and stability. Today, various traffic engineering approaches refine path selection to reduce congestion, packet loss, and latency. However, these techniques generally operate over long time scales, making the route taken by packets sub-optimal. Recent research in overlay networks, such as the RON project, uses active measurements to leverage alternate paths. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and application-level multicast projects also use overlay techniques to improve performance.

### 2.3. Multi-Path Routing

Multi-path routing leverages the existence of multiple, simultaneous paths to enhance reliability and performance. Dispersity routing and IDA split data transfers over multiple paths. Simulation results show the benefits of this approach. Researchers have suggested combining redundant coding with dispersity routing to improve the reliability and performance of both parallel downloads and multicast communication.

### 2.4. Sources of Shared Failures

Multi-path and alternate-path routing schemes assume path independence, which may not hold for typical Internet paths. Single-homed hosts share the same last-mile link, creating a shared bottleneck. Even multi-homed hosts may have unexpected sources of shared failures, such as shared physical infrastructure. Network failures can also be caused by cascading logical failures, denial of service attacks, or global Internet problems like worms and viruses.

## 3. Design

We study two mechanisms for enhanced packet routing: probe-based reactive overlay routing and multi-path redundant routing. These techniques are usually not used independently. For instance, choosing intermediate nodes in redundant routing requires network measurements. The trade-off is the allocation of resources to measurements versus redundant data.

### 3.1. Probe-Based Reactive Overlay Routing

RON-like systems periodically send probes to determine the availability, latency, and loss rate of the paths connecting the nodes in the overlay. The system we evaluate sends a probe every 15 seconds. If a probe is lost, up to four additional probes are sent one second apart to check if the remote host is down. Paths are selected based on the average loss rate over the last 100 probes.

### 3.2. Redundant Multi-Path Routing

Redundant multi-path routing sends duplicate data down multiple paths to recover lost packets. We consider 2-redundant mesh routing, where each packet is sent twice, once on each distinct path. The first packet is sent directly over the Internet, and the second is sent through a randomly chosen intermediate node. When packet losses are independent, redundant data transmissions can effectively mask high loss rates. However, when losses are correlated, FEC schemes lose their effectiveness.

## 4. Evaluation

We evaluate the correlation of losses and failures on a deployed Internet testbed. Table 1 lists the 30 hosts used in our experiments. The testbed spans five countries on three continents and includes a variety of access link technologies. We do not claim that this testbed is representative of the entire Internet, but it provides a diverse environment to evaluate routing tactics and packet loss relationships.

Table 3 lists the three datasets we examine. The first two, measured in 2002, involved 17 hosts. The third, measured in 2003, involved 30 hosts. We focus primarily on the 2003 dataset, highlighting interesting differences from the prior datasets. This dataset focuses on eight combinations of routing methods, collected from six sets of paths.
