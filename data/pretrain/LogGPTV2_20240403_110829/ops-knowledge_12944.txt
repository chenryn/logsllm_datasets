User: I'm writing a cross-platform python script that needs to know if and where Cygwin is installed if the platform is NT. Right now I'm just using a naive check for the existence of the default install path 'C:\Cygwin'. I would like to be able to determine the installation path programmatically.
The Windows registry doesn't appear to be an option since Cygwin no longer stores it's mount points in the registry. Because of this is it even possible to programmatically get a Cygwin installation path?
Assistant: You can use the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cygwin\setup\rootdir value for Cygwin 1.7
