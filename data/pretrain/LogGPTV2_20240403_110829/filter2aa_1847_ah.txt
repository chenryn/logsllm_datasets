#### About `ipfw`
For more information about `ipfw`, the process that controls IP firewall service, you can access its man page. The man page provides details on how to use and implement its features. To access the man page, use the Terminal application and enter:
```sh
man ipfw
```

#### Request for Comments (RFC) Documents
RFC documents provide an overview of a protocol or service and detailed information on how the protocol should behave. Novice server administrators may find the background information in RFCs helpful, while experienced administrators can find all the technical details. You can search for RFC documents by number at [www.faqs.org/rfcs](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs). The "Port Reference" section contains several RFC numbers for various protocols. Additionally, important multicast addresses are documented in the most recent Assigned Numbers RFC, currently RFC 1700.

### Chapter 3: IP Firewall Service

### Chapter 4: NAT Service
**Network Address Translation (NAT)**, also known as IP masquerading or IP aliasing, allows multiple computers to access the Internet with only one assigned IP address. NAT creates a private network that accesses the Internet through a NAT router or gateway.

#### How NAT Works
The NAT router handles all traffic from the private network, remembering which internal address made the request. When the NAT router receives a response, it forwards it to the originating computer. Traffic from the Internet does not reach the computers behind the NAT router unless port forwarding is enabled.

#### Enabling NAT on Mac OS X Server
Enabling NAT on Mac OS X Server requires detailed control over DHCP, so DHCP is configured separately in Server Admin. For more information on DHCP, see Chapter 1, "DHCP Service," on page 7.

Enabling NAT also automatically creates a divert rule in the Firewall configuration.

#### Starting and Stopping NAT Service
Use Server Admin to start and stop NAT service on your default network interface. Starting NAT service also starts DHCP for the default interface.

**To start NAT service:**
1. In Server Admin, select **NAT** from the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Start Service**.

When the service is running, the **Stop Service** option becomes available.

#### Configuring NAT Service
Use Server Admin to specify which network interface is connected to the Internet or other external network.

**To configure NAT service:**
1. In Server Admin, select **NAT** from the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Choose the network interface from the **Share your connection from:** pop-up menu.
4. Click **Save**.

#### Monitoring NAT Service
Monitoring NAT service is useful for troubleshooting and security. This section describes the NAT status overview and monitoring NAT divert activity.

**Viewing the NAT Status Overview:**
1. In Server Admin, choose **NAT Service** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click the **Overview** button.

**Viewing NAT Activity:**
When NAT service is running, it creates a packet divert filter in the IP Firewall service. You can view NAT packet divert events logged by the firewall service, which are useful for network troubleshooting and configuration.

**To view the NAT divert log:**
1. In the Terminal application, enter:
   ```sh
   ipfw add 10 divert natd all from any to any via <interface>
   ```
   Replace `<interface>` with the network interface selected in the NAT section of Server Admin.
2. In Server Admin, choose **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
3. Click **Settings**.
4. Select the **Advanced** tab.
5. Select the rule that was just created.
6. Click the **Edit** button.
7. Choose to log packets that match the filter.
8. Click **OK**.
9. In Server Admin, choose **NAT Service** from the **Computers & Services** list.
10. Click **Settings**.
11. Click **Logging**.
12. Enable logging.
13. Click **Save**.
14. Click the **Log** button to view the log.

#### Where to Find More Information
For more information about `natd`, the daemon process that controls NAT service, access its man page. The man page explains how to use and implement its features. To access the man page, use the Terminal application and enter:
```sh
man natd
```

#### Request for Comments (RFC) Documents
RFC documents provide an overview of a protocol or service and detailed information on how the protocol should behave. For NAT descriptions, see RFC 1631 and RFC 3022.

### Chapter 5: VPN Service
**Virtual Private Network (VPN)** connects two or more computers or networks (nodes) with a private link of encrypted data, simulating a local connection as if the remote computer were attached to the local area network (LAN).

#### Benefits of VPN
- Securely connect users at home or away from the LAN to the LAN using any network connection.
- Connect branch offices over the Internet while maintaining secure communications.
- Allow verified mobile users to access private computer resources from any Internet connection.
- Link multiple LANs together over great distances using existing Internet infrastructure.

This chapter describes VPN authentication methods, transport protocols, and how to configure, manage, and monitor VPN service. It does not include instructions for configuring VPN clients.

#### VPN and Security
VPNs emphasize security through strong authentication of identity and encrypted data transport between nodes for data privacy and integrity.

##### Authentication Method
Mac OS X Server VPN uses Microsoft’s Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAPv2) for authentication, which is the standard Windows authentication scheme for VPN. This method encodes passwords when sent over the network and stores them in a scrambled form on the server, providing good security during network transmission.

If you need to configure a different authentication scheme (e.g., RSA Security’s SecurID), you must edit the VPN configuration file manually. The configuration file is located at:
```
/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.RemoteAccessServers.plist
```

##### Transport Protocols
You can enable either or both of the following encrypted transport protocols:

- **Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)**
  - PPTP is the Windows standard VPN protocol.
  - Offers good encryption and supports various authentication schemes.
  - Uses the user-provided password to produce an encryption key.
  - Supports 40-bit (weak) and 128-bit (strong) encryption.
  - Necessary for Windows or Mac OS X 10.2.x clients.

- **Layer Two Tunnelling Protocol, Secure Internet Protocol (L2TP/IPSec)**
  - L2TP/IPSec uses strong IPSec encryption to tunnel data to and from the network nodes.
  - Requires Security Certificates from a Certificate Authority like Verisign or a pre-defined shared secret between connecting nodes.
  - The shared secret is used to generate encryption keys to establish secure tunnels between nodes.

#### Before Setting Up VPN Service
Determine which transport protocol to use. The table below shows which protocols are supported by different platforms.

| Platform           | L2TP/IPSec | PPTP  |
|--------------------|------------|-------|
| Mac OS X 10.3.x    | Yes        | Yes   |
| Mac OS X 10.2.x    | No         | Yes   |
| Windows (XP)       | Yes        | Yes   |
| Linux or Unix      | Yes        | Yes   |

If using L2TP, you need a Security Certificate from a Certificate Authority or a pre-defined shared secret. If using PPTP, ensure all clients support 128-bit PPTP connections for maximum security. Enabling 40-bit transport security is a serious security risk.

#### Managing VPN Service
This section describes tasks associated with managing VPN service, including starting, stopping, and configuring the service.

**To start or stop VPN service:**
1. In Server Admin, choose **VPN Service** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Ensure at least one transport protocol is checked and configured.
3. Click **Start Service** or **Stop Service**.

**Enabling and Configuring L2TP Transport Protocol:**
1. In Server Admin, choose **VPN Service** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
4. Select **L2TP**.
5. Enter the shared secret.
6. Set the beginning and ending IP addresses of the allocation range.
7. Enter the group that has access to VPN login (use the **Users & Groups** button to browse for a group).
8. Click **Save**.

**Enabling and Configuring PPTP Transport Protocol:**
1. In Server Admin, choose **VPN Service** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
