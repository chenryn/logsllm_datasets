User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Linux mysql server will not start, or restart Intro

Im running MariaDB and Apache on my linux machine and today I ran into some problems.

I connect to the server via SSH and here are some of the issues Im facing. I have absolutely no idea what Im dooing here.

What I am doing

Step 1: mysql -u USERNAME -p


  ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket
  '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2 "No such file or directory")


Ok, so I figured, lets try and stop the mysql service



Step 2: sudo service mysql stop

Ok, no errors, so restart the service



Step 3: sudo service mysql restart


  Job for mysql.service failed. See "systemctl status mysql.service" and
  "journalctl -xe" for details.


Ok so I better run those two commands and se what I get



Step 4: status mysql.service



Hmm.. ok lets try the other one



Step 5: journalctl -xe


  No journal files were found.


Ok, Im lost here..

The issue of diskspace

It does not look like diskspace is an issue

Assistant: This is the reason it isn't starting:

Double-check permissions on /var/lib/mysql.  Also, check your system log to see if SE-Linux or Apparmor are interfering.
