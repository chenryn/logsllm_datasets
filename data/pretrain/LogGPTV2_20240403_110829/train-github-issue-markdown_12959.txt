## Steps to Reproduce
I see Row and Column widgets as a UIStackView and would expect spacing
parameter so that we can add custom spacing between their children. Something
like spacing.  
I always end up adding additional Containers in between and this is far from
clean solution from my pov - something like this:
    new Column(
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
      children: [
        new Container(
          height: 20.0,
          child: new Image.asset('assets/images/someimage.png'),
        ),
        new Container(
          height: 8.0,
        ),
        new Container(
          height: 20.0,
          child: new Image.asset('assets/images/someimage.png'),
        ),
      )
    )
I understand that there are other ways to do this but all of them induce extra
logic and make code harder to read.
