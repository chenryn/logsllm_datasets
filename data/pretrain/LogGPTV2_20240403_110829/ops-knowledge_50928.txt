User: I have a model with an attribute that is a reference to another model. The model it references depends on some logic. Is there a way to have a computed property that gives me the same ReferenceProperty niceties (reverse references, dereferencing)?
So far I the computed property stores a db.Key, but this is not optimal. Can I have a Computed 
Reference Property?
Assistant: To do this you'd have to write your own custom Property subclass. You should be able to do so by examining the code behind ComputedProperty and ReferenceProperty; in effect you'd be combining the two.
