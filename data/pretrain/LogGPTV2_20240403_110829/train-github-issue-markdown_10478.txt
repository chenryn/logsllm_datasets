# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
I have an app that imports both `pixi.js` and `pixi-batch-renderer`. `pixi-
batch-renderer` imports classes from `pixi.js` as well.
The resulting bundle has two pixi.js instances - one from the ESM build
(required from the app itself), and one from the CJS build (required from
pixi-batch-renderer). (required means `require()` inside the bundle).
This should not be the case - webpack should only bundle the ESM version.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
The full reproduction is here: https://github.com/SukantPal/webpack-duplicate-
bundle
I've given more details there.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Only one version of pixi.js should be bundled.
