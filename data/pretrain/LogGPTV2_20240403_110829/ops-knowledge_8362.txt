**Exception Reason and Solution:**

The log indicates that the `chrome.exe *64` program attempted to connect to the `qa.sockets.stackexchange.com:443` server via the HTTP proxy `proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070`. The connection request was rejected, and the following error message was displayed:
```
Could not connect to proxy proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070 - connection attempt failed with error 10061.
```

This error (code 10061) signifies a network exception where the connection was refused. Possible reasons for this issue include, but are not limited to:

1. **Target Server Configuration:**
   - The target server (`qa.sockets.stackexchange.com:443`) may not have the HTTPS service enabled.
   
2. **Proxy Server Issues:**
   - The proxy server (`proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070`) may be experiencing a failure or is not configured correctly.
   
3. **Network Quality:**
   - There may be poor network quality or connectivity issues between the client, the proxy server, and the target server.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Check Proxy Server:**
   - Verify the status and configuration of the proxy server `proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070`.
   - Ensure that the proxy server is running and accessible from the client machine.
   - Check for any firewall or security settings that might be blocking the connection.

2. **Verify Target Server:**
   - Confirm that the `qa.sockets.stackexchange.com:443` server has the HTTPS service enabled.
   - Ensure that the server is reachable and responsive.

3. **Network Diagnostics:**
   - Perform network diagnostics to check for any connectivity issues.
   - Use tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, or `telnet` to test the connection between the client, the proxy server, and the target server.
   - Check for any network congestion or other issues that might be affecting the connection.

By addressing these potential causes, the issue should be resolved, and the `chrome.exe *64` program should be able to successfully connect through the proxy server to the target server.
