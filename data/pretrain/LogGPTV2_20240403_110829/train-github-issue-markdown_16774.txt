In Firefox when using InputAdornement on a TextField of `type="number` the
adornment is moving outside if the field / wrapper is not big enough. I
prepared an example (see link below). For that I copied the example from the
docs and just added the `type` property.

I have no idea why this is happening or how to fix that.
