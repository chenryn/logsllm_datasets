##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
core
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.2.0.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
This bug is related to tripleo-quickstart, an Ansible based project for
setting up TripleO virtual environments, which customizes the conf as follows:
    [defaults]
    command_warnings = False
    retry_files_enabled = False
    callback_whitelist = profile_tasks
    host_key_checking = False
    force_color = 1
    # Attempt to load custom modules whether it's installed system-wide or from a virtual environment
    callback_plugins = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ara/plugins/callbacks:$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ara/plugins/callbacks:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ara/plugins/callbacks
    test_plugins = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tripleo-quickstart/test_plugins:$VIRTUAL_ENV/usr/local/share/tripleo-quickstart/test_plugins:test_plugins
    library = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tripleo-quickstart/library:$VIRTUAL_ENV/usr/local/share/tripleo-quickstart/library:library
    roles_path = roles:$VIRTUAL_ENV/usr/local/share/tripleo-quickstart/roles:$VIRTUAL_ENV/usr/local/share/ansible/roles
    [ssh_connection]
    control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
So nothing that seems related to the problem I'm getting.
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)
##### SUMMARY
Until ansible 2.1.0 this section of my main task always worked:
    - name: Get overcloud-ha-test-suite on undercloud and controllers
      vars:
        nodes:
          - "undercloud"
          - "{{ groups['controller'] }}"
      shell: >
        rm -rf tripleo-director-ha-test-suite;
        git clone https://github.com/rscarazz/tripleo-director-ha-test-suite/ tripleo-director-ha-test-suite;
      delegate_to: "{{ item }}"
      with_items: "{{ nodes }}"
Each element of nodes exists and is taken from the correctly populated
inventory.  
After upgrading to ansible 2.2.0 a strange behavior happens, the section fails
because {{ item }} takes values like "skipped" and "changed" making ssh
connections failing.  
Issue was solved by this commit, with this modification:
    - name: Get overcloud-ha-test-suite on undercloud and controllers
      shell: >
        rm -rf tripleo-director-ha-test-suite;
        git clone https://github.com/rscarazz/tripleo-director-ha-test-suite/ tripleo-director-ha-test-suite;
      delegate_to: "{{ item }}"
      with_items:
        - "undercloud"
    - "{{ groups['controller'] }}"
but I think it should work in both cases.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
To reproduce the problem simply use the code above, trying to run the action
after creating an inventory with expected elements, "undercloud" and "{{
groups['controller'] }}" (usually a 3 elements array).
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Execution of the action, without any error in both cases.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
As one can see from the output the host on which the action is taken is
"skipped" and not the hostname as expected:
    14:59:42  ESTABLISH SSH CONNECTION FOR USER: None
    14:59:42  SSH: EXEC ssh -vvv -F workspace/ssh.config.ansible -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o KbdInteractiveAuthentication=no -o PreferredAuthentications=gssapi-with-mic,gssapi-keyex,hostbased,publickey -o PasswordAuthentication=no -o ConnectTimeout=10 skipped '/bin/sh -c '"'"'( umask 77 && mkdir -p "` echo $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1485269982.15-73426610894136 `" && echo ansible-tmp-1485269982.15-73426610894136="` echo $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1485269982.15-73426610894136 `" ) && sleep 0'"'"''
    14:59:42 failed: [undercloud] (item=skipped) => {
    14:59:42     "item": "skipped", 
    14:59:42     "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: OpenSSH_6.6.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013\r\ndebug1: Reading configuration data workspace/ssh.config.ansible\r\ndebug1: workspace/ssh.config.ansible line 2: Applying options for *\r\nssh: Could not resolve hostname skipped: Name or service not known\r\n", 
    14:59:42     "unreachable": true
    14:59:42 }
Same is on the next error, but this time with "changed":
    14:59:42  ESTABLISH SSH CONNECTION FOR USER: None
    14:59:42  SSH: EXEC ssh -vvv -F workspace/ssh.config.ansible -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o KbdInteractiveAuthentication=no -o PreferredAuthentications=gssapi-with-mic,gssapi-keyex,hostbased,publickey -o PasswordAuthentication=no -o ConnectTimeout=10 changed '/bin/sh -c '"'"'( umask 77 && mkdir -p "` echo $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1485269982.24-237524239100501 `" && echo ansible-tmp-1485269982.24-237524239100501="` echo $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1485269982.24-237524239100501 `" ) && sleep 0'"'"''
    14:59:42 failed: [undercloud] (item=changed) => {
    14:59:42     "item": "changed", 
    14:59:42     "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: OpenSSH_6.6.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013\r\ndebug1: Reading configuration data workspace/ssh.config.ansible\r\ndebug1: workspace/ssh.config.ansible line 2: Applying options for *\r\nssh: Could not resolve hostname changed: Name or service not known\r\n", 
    14:59:42     "unreachable": true
    14:59:42 }
I don't know if this can be considered a duplicate of this other issue, since
the behavior is slightly different, but maybe it is related.
