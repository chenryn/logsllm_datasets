Description of what I'm doing:
I'm porting the hello world app on the Quick Start page to Clojurescript
https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md
Here is my port of main.js to Clojurescript:
https://gist.github.com/frankhale/8fe873601fb4212cdc87
I have the requisite files in my project and it works fine using the provided
main.js. When I use my Clojurescript compiled main.js atom-shell tells me my
app is not valid. The project structure is exactly as it should be and all I'm
replacing is the Javascript version of main.js with a Clojurescript compiled
main.js from my translation of the Javascript.
Question for atom-shell developers:
Is there a way to debug what is going on when atom-shell tries to start my
application? I'm running atom.exe and dragging my app folder into the window.
I've opened the dev tools but no errors are reported. All I get is a message
saying that my app is not valid.
Question for somebody that may be able to help debug the Clojurescript:
If anyone knows Clojurescript would you mind taking a look at my Gist to see
if I've made any crazy mistakes? I've been trying to get this working for
several hours. The code looks straightforward enough and doesn't look like it
should be a problem porting.
Here is a repo of my project for those that may want to have a look:
