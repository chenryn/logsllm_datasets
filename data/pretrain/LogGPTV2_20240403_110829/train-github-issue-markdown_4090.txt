After the update, interpolation strings in a plain `.js` file don't get
highlighted anymore. Previous behaviour highlighted plain text, the `$` symbol
and the interpolation braces. Now everything between _``_ has no colouring at
all.
    function sayHello(customer)
    {
        console.log(`Hello ${customer}`);
    }
