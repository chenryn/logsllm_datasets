ABSTRACT
The most researched behavioral biometrics for mobile device au-
thentication involves the use of touch gestures as the user enters a
graphical pattern password (like the one used on Android) or other-
wise interacts with the device. However, due to the inherent static
nature of these schemes, they are vulnerable to impersonation at-
tacks. In this paper, we investigate challenge-response mechanisms
to address this security vulnerability underlying the traditional
static biometric schemes. We study the performance, security, and
usability of two schemes of such challenge-response interactive
biometric authentication geared for mobile devices and contrast
them to static graphical pattern based biometrics. The first scheme
is based on random graphical patterns. The second scheme, re-
cently introduced for PC class of devices (not mobile), is based on a
simple cognitive game involving semantic interactive random chal-
lenges. Our results show that the accuracy of user identification
with these approaches is similar to static pattern based biometric
scheme. Finally, we argue that utilizing interactivity and random-
ization significantly enhance the security against impersonation
attacks. As an independent result, our work demonstrates that the
use of motion sensors available on mobile device serves to improve
the identification accuracy of schemes that only use touch-based
gestures (static and interactive).

1 INTRODUCTION
Traditional user authentication suffers from various well-
documented usability and security issues. These issues are more
severe on mobile devices due to their small screen size. In particular,
passwords and graphical patterns (e.g., Android login patterns) are
prone to dictionary guessing automated attacks, shoulder surfing
attacks and smudge attacks [6, 31, 34, 38]. Other physical biomet-
rics, such as fingerprint and face recognition are also susceptible to
spoofing and impersonation attacks [20].
Behavioral biometrics have been studied extensively over the
last decade aiming to solve the problems associated with traditional
user authentication methods. Such biometric schemes can be used
as a stand alone way for authenticating the user [14, 18, 19, 23] or to
be added to another authentication scheme [15, 33] so as to provide
a second layer of security. However, more research is still needed to
enhance the security and usability of behavioral biometrics. This is
because all of the proposed schemes suffer from high rejection rate
of legitimate users (and hence low usability), high acceptance rate
of other users (and hence low security against zero-effort attacks)
and susceptible to impersonation attacks. Many impersonation
attacks have been explored that compromise the security provided
by behavioral biometrics. These include training humans to mimic
victims [37], and building robots [32] and malware programs [28]
to mimic a victim via external observation or internally through a
compromised device, respectively. These attacks have been shown
to bypass the security provided by the behavioral biometric schemes
with up to 100% accuracy.
The above security vulnerabilities of existing behavioral biomet-
ric schemes stem from their inherent static nature. In this paper,
aiming to enhance the security of these schemes against imper-
sonation attacks, we investigate the use of interactive biometrics,
taking the form of challenge-response authentication. The motiva-
tion of such challenge-response interactive behavioral biometrics
is to prevent attacks that try to record the user interaction with the
authentication construct and replay it later to impersonate the user
as in the case of static biometric schemes.
Specifically, we study two schemes of such challenge-response
behavioral biometric authentication on mobile devices. These
schemes can be utilized to authenticate the user, e.g., to the de-
vice, to an app or to a remote web-site. The first challenge-response
biometrics we study, called CR-Pattern (Figure 1b), is based on graph-
ical patterns (akin to Android pattern based login). However, rather
than asking the user to enter her static pattern, we display a random
challenge (pattern) and ask the user to re-enter it. This pattern is
not used as a password (unlike the case of Android) but rather to
extract biometric features. The second interactive biometrics we

matching challenges. We present such challenges as simple drag
and drop games, where the user has to drag randomly moving
objects to their corresponding target objects, where the moving
objects and the target objects are semantically related. Such type
of challenges allows us to identify the user based on her unique
cognitive abilities, e.g., the time taken to complete the challenge,
in addition to other features captured by the touch behavior. Bio-
metrics based on semantic challenges has been previously explored
in [27] and shown to be effective on the PC class of devices. In this
work, we design and evaluate its effectiveness in the context of
mobile devices, not studied before.
As a baseline for our study, we further study a method called
S-Pattern biometrics (proposed in [15] – Figure 1a), in which we
try to authenticate the users based on the way they enter the static
graphical pattern on mobile devices. This scheme is representative
of static behavioral biometrics, but is vulnerable to multiple attacks
in the literature that mainly record the user interaction with authen-
tication construct or learn the user biometrics from her template
and then try to reproduce the user biometrics automatically, e.g.,
malware or robot, or by expert human attacker [28, 32, 37]. In our
study, we compare CR-Pattern and Gametrics with S-Pattern and
study the feasibility of the former two approaches in enhancing the
security of S-Pattern.
Our Contributions: In this paper, we study challenge-response
behavioral mobile authentication. The main contributions of this
paper are summarized below:
(1) Design and Implementation of Three Behavioral Biometrics
Schemes: As part of our study, we design and implement three
Android applications that we utilized to record the user in-
teractions corresponding to the three methods, S-Pattern, CR-
Pattern and Gametrics captured by touch, motion and position
sensors (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope). Then, we extract
several features from each challenge solving instance and apply
machine learning techniques to identify the users.
(2) Evaluation of the Three Schemes under Benign Settings and Zero-
Effort Attacks: We collected data from multiple users in a lab set-
ting and we show that we can identify the legitimate users and
the zero-effort attackers with high accuracy using all schemes
(F-measure of up to 89% for S-Pattern, 86% for CR-Pattern and
83% for Gametrics). As an independent result, we further show
that utilizing the motion and the position sensors improve the
classification accuracy of the three studied biometric schemes
(F-measure of up to 100% for the three schemes). Prior schemes
[15, 27] have not studied the use of such sensors. We also assess
the usability of the three schemes and find that all three offer
an acceptable level of user experience.
(3) Evaluation of the Three Schemes under Active Attacks: We show
that challenge-response schemes are more resilient to active
impersonation attacks compared to existing static biometric
schemes. Moreover, we argue that the multiple round of inter-
actions and the semantic challenge embedded in Gametrics en-
hance the security of Gametrics compared to CR-Pattern.
Results Summary: The paper shows that the challenge-response
schemes offer similar level of usability to traditional pattern unlock
measured by the user experience survey and provide higher level
of security against various types of impersonation attacks. On the
negative side, the challenge-response schemes require longer time
for authentication. This suggests that selection of the biometric
scheme can be dependent on the application. For example, for the
applications in which login speed is vital and security demands are
not that high (e.g., in phone locking application since this already
requires the attacker to have physical possession of the phone),
S-Pattern is better-suited. On the other hand, for the applications
with larger time budget and higher security demands, like web
authentication, banking apps, CR-Pattern or Gametrics can be used.
The multiple levels of interaction in Gametrics provide extra level of
security compared to CR-Pattern and therefore could be chosen for
high-security scenarios such as financial applications. The results
of our study show that utilizing the motion and position sensors
on mobile devices enhances the classification accuracy both in
reducing the rate of rejecting legitimate user and reducing the
rate of accepting zero-effort attacker, shoulder-surfing attacker and
other forms of impersonation attackers. In this light, we recommend
the sensor recordings be always included as classification features.
Paper Outline: The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we lay out the evaluation criteria and the threat model.
In Section 3, we describe the design and implementation of the
three behavioral biometric schemes. In Section 4, we elaborate on
our data collection methodology and procedures. Then in Section
5, we describe our feature extraction methods and our classifica-
tion models. In Section 6, we provide the classification results in
benign setting and against zero-effort attackers. Then in Section
7, we present the usability of the three studied-schemes in terms
of completion time and user experience. In Section 8, we evaluate
the three biometric schemes against active attacks. In Section 9, we
discuss further aspects of our work and provide future research di-
rections. In Section 10, we provide an overview of prior behavioral
biometric systems. Finally, in Section 11, we conclude our work.
2 EVALUATION CRITERIA AND THREAT
MODEL
The goal of any behavioral authentication scheme is to authenticate
the user efficiently with high accuracy while preventing different
kinds of impersonation attacks as much as possible. To this end, in
our study, we set out to analyze the three behavioral authentication
schemes (i.e., S-Pattern, CR-Pattern, and Gametrics) and compare
them in terms of authentication accuracy and susceptibility to
the impersonation attacks. In particular, we evaluate the three
authentication schemes with respect to the criteria described below.
(1) Usability
ation attacks.
(a) Accuracy of user identification. The authentication system
should identify the legitimate user with high accuracy and
with minimal false alarm.
(b) User experience and perception. The authentication system
should have minimal user-effort in its authentication process.
(c) Time taken to identify the user. Time taken by the authen-
tication system to identify the user should be reasonably
low.
(2) Security against the following types of deliberate imperson-

(a) Smudge Attacks: An external attacker should not be able to
learn the authentication token based on the screen smudges
and use this knowledge to mimic/impersonate the user [6].
(b) Shoulder-Surfing Attacks: An external attacker who monitors
the user while she is authenticating herself to the system
should not be able to mimic and impersonate the user at a
later point of time.
(c) Automated Attacks: The attacker who steals a user’s authenti-
cation template (e.g., by hacking into the device or the server
that stores this template) should not be able to authenticate
itself to the system in an automated manner [32].
(d) Internal Attacks: A malware residing on the authentication
device itself may have the ability to record the user’s valid
authentication token or template and replay it later to authen-
ticate itself on behalf of victim user. Further, it may learn the
authentication token/template by recording multiple valid
authentication tokens and create the template by itself. Such
attackers should not be able to fool the authentication scheme.
Other forms of behavioral biometrics schemes have been
shown to be vulnerable to such internal attacks [28].
3 METHODS DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of three behavioral biometric
schemes considered in this study, we designed and implemented
three Android apps.
• S-Pattern App: This is a simple Android app that mimics the
traditional graphical pattern-lock in Android devices. The app
contains instruction text, text box, a start button and a grid of
nine dots (a snapshot of the app is shown in Figure 1a). The
instruction text displays the instruction for the user during the
study. The user provides her name in the text box and hit the
start button to start the app. The user is then instructed to input a
fixed pattern (3-2-5-8-7)1. Once the user has supplied the pattern,
the app validates its correctness. On correct pattern entry, the
counter gets increased by one, the pattern changes its color to
green and then disappears at the end. On incorrect pattern entry,
the pattern changes its color to red and informs the user that
she has provided the incorrect pattern. During the pattern entry
process, the app records the interaction of the user with the device
that is captured by touch screen sensor as well as motion and
position sensors. The sensors utilized in our study are listed in
Table 1. The data collection session ends when the user correctly
inputs the pattern thirty times.

The user has to match the cartoon animals with the real
animal images.
Figure 1: Snapshots of the three apps
• CR-Pattern App: This app is similar to our S-Pattern app, except
that the app displays a random pattern each time. A sample of
the random pattern displayed to the user is as shown in Figure
1b. Each of the generated patterns has a length of 5 (the same
length as that of the pattern used in S-Pattern app). The app
generates a random pattern and the user is asked to input the
displayed pattern. If the user failed in repeating the displayed
pattern, the app re-displays the pattern, and the user is instructed
to retry entering the pattern. Once the user enters the pattern
correctly, the app generates a new random pattern. At each data
collection session, the app generates 30 random patterns. As in
S-Pattern app, the app records all the user interaction with the
device measured by touch screen, motion and position sensors.
• Gametrics App: This Android app first displays an instruction
text that provides the details on how to solve the interactive game
challenge. The app then shows a text box where the user enters
her name. Next, the user presses the start button to proceed with
the experiment. The app then displays a semantic interactive
challenge, represented as a simple drag and drop game. Each
challenge consists of 3 target objects and 6 moving objects. In
order to solve a challenge, the user needs to understand the con-
tents of the target and the moving objects/images, the semantic
357relationship between them, and then requires to drag a subset
of the moving objects (answer objects) to their corresponding
target objects. After each drag and drop, the game code checks
the correctness of the user action. If the object was dropped to its
corresponding target, the object disappears informing the user
that she has performed a correct drag and drop, otherwise the
object is moved to a random location. The game ends, when the
user successfully drags all the answer objects to their correspond-
ing targets. At the start of the challenge, the moving objects are
placed at random locations on the screen of the phone and then
each of them starts moving on a random direction picked from
North, East, South, West, North-West, West-East, South-East, and
South-West. The object keeps on moving on that direction till it
collides with another object or the screen border where upon it
picks a new random direction. During the data collection, once
the challenge is solved successfully, a new challenge is presented
to the user. We implemented 6 different semantic interactive chal-
lenges and presented 30 challenges to the user in random order
by repeating each of the challenges five times. A snapshot of one
of the semantic interactive challenge is shown in Figure 1c. The
Gametrics app records the user interaction with the device while
solving the challenges as in the previous two apps. It also records
the moving object locations. The design of this app is in line with
the one proposed in [27].
Although, for each of the schemes, we asked the users to input
the pattern, or solve the challenge 30 times for our analysis purpose,
in the real-world implementation, the user is asked for only once.
