Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Use Command Pallet in Japanese
![command-
pallet-i18n](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1937871/14066294/c4e20786-f480-11e5-852c-4a46e97ff853.gif)
I cannot use commands in English.  
Japanese IME inputs text as hiragana at first. Then we push the space key,
then the text is converted to a combination of hiragana, katakana, and kanji.  
This is meaning we cannot use incremental search efficiently.
This is very inconvenient.
Can I turn i18n off?
