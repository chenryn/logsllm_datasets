### NTLM Authentication and New Vulnerabilities

#### NTLM Authentication Process
- **Message Integrity Code (MIC):** The MIC is calculated using the HMAC_MD5 algorithm with the session key and a concatenation of the NTLM_NEGOTIATE, NTLM_CHALLENGE, and NTLM_AUTHENTICATE messages.
  
#### New Vulnerabilities in NTLM
- **Session Key Vulnerability:**
  - **Issue:** An attacker can retrieve the session key by removing the target hostname from the NTLM_CHALLENGE message.
  - **Steps to Overcome:**
    1. Modify the NTLM_CHALLENGE message to remove the target hostname.
    2. Recalculate the MIC based on the original NTLM_CHALLENGE message.
    3. The client provides a MIC based on the modified NTLM_CHALLENGE message.
  
- **NTLMv1 Issues:**
  - **Problem:** NTLMv1 messages do not include av_pairs, which means there is no target field. This makes them vulnerable to the attack.
  - **Non-Windows Targets:** Non-Windows targets are still vulnerable even after patching.

- **Drop the MIC:**
  - **MIC Calculation:** 
    ```plaintext
    MIC = HMAC_MD5(SessionKey, ConcatenationOf(NTLM_NEGOTIATE, NTLM_CHALLENGE, NTLM_AUTHENTICATE))
    ```
  - **Protection Mechanism:** If session privacy/integrity is negotiated, attackers cannot take over the session. The MIC protects the NTLM negotiation from tampering.
  - **Overcoming the Obstacle:**
    - SMB clients enable signing by default and use a MIC.
    - It is not trivial to relay SMB to another protocol that relies on this negotiation flag.
    - **Solution:** Remove the MIC if the session key is known. Removing the MIC also requires removing the version and some negotiation flags.
    - **Result:** Tampering with any stage of the NTLM authentication flow becomes possible when the MIC is removed.

- **MIC Bypass:**
  - **Problem:** The presence of the MIC is indicated in the `msvAvFlags` attribute in the NTLM authentication message. Even if the corresponding bit is set, the target server does not verify the MIC's presence.
  - **Fix:** Verify the presence of the MIC if `msvAvFlags` indicate it should be present.
  - **Issues:**
    - Some clients (e.g., Firefox on Linux or MacOS) do not add a MIC by default, making them vulnerable to NTLM session tampering.
    - **CVE-2019-1166:** A more serious issue related to the MIC bypass.

- **Enhanced Protection for Authentication (EPA) Bypass:**
  - **EPA Mechanism:**
    - EPA binds authentication packets to a secure TLS channel.
    - Adds a Channel Bindings field to the NTLM_AUTHENTICATE message based on the target server certificate.
    - Prevents attackers from relaying the authentication to another server.
    - Modification requires knowledge of the userâ€™s NT HASH.
  - **Servers Protected by EPA:**
    - AD-FS
    - OWA
    - LDAPS
    - Other HTTP servers (e.g., SharePoint)
  - **Default Configuration:** EPA is disabled by default on most servers, making them vulnerable to simpler attack vectors.
  - **Bypass Method:**
    - Inject a Channel Binding field into the NTLM_CHALLENGE message.
    - The client will add the crafted field to the NTLM_AUTHENTICATE message.
    - The server verifies the first Channel Binding, ignoring additional fields.
  - **Fix:**
    - Servers should deny authentication requests with more than one channel binding value.
    - **Issues:**
      - Clients that do not support EPA and do not add a MIC (e.g., Firefox on Linux or MacOS) remain vulnerable.
      - One such client can make the entire domain vulnerable.

### Attacking AD-FS
- **AD-FS Architecture:**
  - Refer to [Sherweb Blog](https://www.sherweb.com/blog/office-365/active-directory-federation-services/) for details.
- **AD-FS Proxy:**
  - Open to the internet and an easy target for brute-force/password spraying attacks.
  - **External Lockout Policy:** Locks the user coming from the external network after exceeding the Extranet Lockout Threshold.
- **Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA):**
  - Uses Kerberos or NTLM SSO capabilities to authenticate to AD-FS.
  - **NTLM Relay Attack:** NTLM authentications targeting the AD FS proxy allowed attackers to bypass the external lockout policy (CVE-2019-1126).
  - **Kerberos Brute-Force Attack:** Generates service tickets using different passwords and sends them to the AD-FS proxy. If the password is guessed correctly, attackers can log into cloud resources with desired privileges. No logs are generated for unsuccessful attempts (Reverse-Kerberoasting).

### Takeaways
- **Patch all vulnerable machines!**
- **Restrict NTLM usage as much as possible.**
- **Prefer Kerberos over NTLM.**
- **Disable NTLMv1 in your environment.**
- **Configure GPO for Network Security:**
  - Set 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM'.
  - Refer to [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-lan-manager-authentication-level) for more details.
- **Incorporate NTLM relay mitigations:**
  - SMB and LDAP signing.
  - LDAP channel binding.
  - EPA.
