design that can decode concurrent transmissions.
3.3.1 Recto-Piezos
To better understand the problem of limited bandwidth of PAB’s
piezoelectric sensors, we run an experiment where we measure the
voltage at the output of the rectifier of a backscatter node. This volt-
age is directly related to the harvested energy and used to power up
the node. The backscatter node used in this experiment is optimized
to harvest energy around 15 kHz (as per the impedance matching
process described in §3.2). We transmit a continuous wave signal
at 15 kHz using our projector, and measure the received voltage at
the output of the rectifier. We repeat the experiment multiple times,
each time transmitting at a different center frequency.
Fig. 3 plots the rectified voltage as a function of frequency using
a solid black line. The plot shows that the rectified voltage (and
hence the harvested energy) reaches its maximum of 4 V around the
resonant frequency of 15 kHz. However, the voltage drops rapidly as
3This is typically referred to as having a high quality factor Q = f/Bandwidth [76].
Figure 3—Rectopiezo. The figure plots the rectified voltage as a function of the down-
link transmit frequency for two different recto-piezo configurations. One of the recto-
piezos (in black) is electrically matched at 15 kHz and the second (in orange) at 18 kHz.
we move away from that frequency. When the downlink frequency
is outside 13.6-16.4 kHz, the voltage drops below 2.5V, which is the
minimum required by our backscatter node to consistently power up
for sensing and communication.
To overcome this bandwidth constraint and enable concurrent
transmissions at multiple different frequency channels (i.e., via
FDMA),4 PAB shifts the resonance frequency itself. In particular,
recall from Eq. 2 that backscatter operates by alternating between
reflective and absorptive states, and that these states can be real-
ized by properly matching the load impedance, ZL, to the source
impedance, Zs . To shift the resonance frequency, PAB exploits the
fact that the impedance Z(f ) itself is a function of frequency. Indeed,
this is why the voltage falls off in Fig. 3 beyond a certain band-
width. This frequency dependence provides an opportunity to enable
concurrent transmissions, each of which is matched to a different
resonance. Said differently, we can design different sensors with
matching circuits that are optimized to different center frequencies.
We call this design recto-piezo as it exploits the matching properties
of the piezoelectric interface to the rectifier to tune the resonance
frequency.5
To test this idea, we design another backscatter node, this time
with a recto-piezo optimized to resonate at 18 kHz. The projector
sends a downlink signal at 18 kHz, and we plot the resulting rectified
voltage as a function of frequency in orange in Fig. 3. The plot also
shows that the rectified voltage rises above the threshold around the
new resonance frequency and over a bandwidth of 1.5 kHz. Also,
notice that the responses of the two recto-piezos are complementary.
This suggests that these sensors can operate concurrently while
occupying different frequency channels, thus increasing the overall
network throughput.
3.3.2 Decoding Collisions
In standard FDMA systems, when two transmitters occupy different
channels, a receiver may apply a filter around the center frequency
of interest in order to isolate the desired transmission and eliminate
interference from the concurrent transmission on another channel.
Unfortunately, this does not hold true for backscatter transmissions.
4Note that CDMA requires the same overall bandwidth as standard FDMA since it uses
a spreading code at a higher rate than the transmitted signals, thus requiring a larger
frequency (as it is a spread spectrum technology).
5It is important to note that while the recto-piezo can shift the resonance frequency
through impedance matching, the overall efficiency decreases well outside the geometric
resonance of the piezoelectric material itself. Said differently, the geometric resonance
acts as a bandpass filter, while the electrical matching determines the exact frequency.

The difficulty in isolating transmissions from different frequen-
cies arises from the fact that backscatter modulation is frequency-
agnostic [48]. Specifically, a backscatter node communicates by
reflecting incoming signals. Hence, as long as a node powers up
(due to a downlink signal within its resonance bandwidth), it would
backscatter and modulate the reflections of all signals impinging on
it, even those outside its resonance frequency.6 As a result, even if
a recto-piezo requires a downlink signal at a resonance frequency
of 18 kHz to power up, it would also backscatter signals at 15 kHz,
thus interfering with a concurrent transmission at the 15 kHz range.
Indeed, when we tried operating both recto-piezos from §3.3.1 con-
currently, the hydrophone received colliding signals and was unable
to decode them.
To overcome this challenge, we observe that the two backscatter
transmissions not only collide at 15 kHz but also at 18 kHz. This pro-
vides the hydrophone receiver with two equations and two unknowns.
Moreover, because the matching process results in frequency selec-
tivity, the wireless channel experienced by the backscattered signals
would be different. Mathematically, the hydrophone receiver would
obtain the following two signals:
y(f1) = h1(f1)x1 + h2(f1)x2
y(f2) = h1(f2)x1 + h2(f2)x2
where y is the received signal, f1 and f2 are the resonance fre-
quencies, x1 and x2 are the backscattered signals by the two the
recto-piezos, and h1 and h2 are their corresponding frequency-
selective channels.
The above behavior is similar to the one obtained in MIMO com-
munication between two-antenna nodes. MIMO exploits spatial di-
versity, while our decoding scheme exploits frequency diversity.7 By
performing standard channel estimation, we can invert the channel
matrix and decode the two signals using standard MIMO decoding
techniques [80].
Two additional points are worth noting:
• Our above discussion focused on the physical and MAC layers
of the communication system. Our design extends to encompass
the entire networking stack and incorporates a protocol similar
to that adopted by RFIDs. Specifically, the projector is similar
to an RFID reader and transmits a query on the downlink which
contains a preamble, destination address, and payload. Similarly,
the uplink backscatter packet consists of a preamble, a header,
and a payload which includes reading from on-board sensors as
we describe in §5.1.
• Our description of recto-piezo assumes that each backscatter node
can operate at a single predefined resonance frequency. This
design may be easily extended through programmable hardware
to enable the backscatter node to shift its own resonance frequency.
This may be achieved by incorporating multiple matching circuits
onboard the backscatter node and enabling the micro-controller
to select the recto-piezo.

4 MECHANICAL FABRICATION AND
HARDWARE DESIGN
In this section, we describe our mechanical and hardware fabrication
process for PAB’s backscatter nodes.
4.1 Transducer Fabrication
Fig. 4(a) shows a photo of one of our fabricated transducers. The
main component of the transducer is a piezoelectric cylinder. We
purchased a ceramic cylinder from Stemnic with an in-air resonance
frequency of 17 kHz [66], a radius of 2.5 cm, and a length of 4 cm.
The cylinder vibrates radially making it omnidirectional in the hori-
zontal plane. The choice of in-air resonance of 17 kHz was intended
to create balance between the size of the transducer, the propaga-
tion characteristics of acoustic signals underwater, and throughput.
Specifically, lower acoustic frequencies experience less attenuation
in underwater environments [11], but they also have narrower band-
widths (which further limits their throughput) and require larger
cylinder dimensions since the dimensions of the resonator are in-
versely proportional to its frequency [12].8 Nonetheless, we note
that our design is general and can be adapted to different applications
that have different range, size, and throughput requirements.
Fig. 4(b) shows an exploded view of our transducer design. Our
design follows prior proposals for low-cost underwater transducers
and is adapted to the geometry of our cylinder and its operation
frequency [6, 28].9 We encapsulated the piezoelectric resonator with
a polymer and added end-caps on the top and bottom of the cylinder.
The encapsulation and end-caps serve to insulate the electrodes from
water (preventing it from shorting the electrodes) and to prevent wa-
ter from flowing inside the cylinder and loading its resonance. Such
design is called an air-backed, end-capped transducer and is known
to provide high efficiency in electromechanical conversion [12].
6The modulation depth of backscattered signals (i.e., difference between reflected and
absorbed power) decreases as their frequency moves away from resonance due to the
degradation in impedance matching and efficiency.
7We note that our system is not the first to propose decoding backscatter collisions [82];
however, by exploiting the concept of recto-piezo, our proposed approach makes the
decoding matrix better conditioned, which improves diversity.
8For example, a resonator with center frequency of 500 Hz can propagate over 1000 km,
but has a bitrate of 100bps and is 3600× larger than our cylinder [51].
9There are various design choices for an underwater piezoelectric transducer; the
efficiency and directionality of each design depend on various parameters including
the type of piezoelectric material, shape of the transducer, backing and encapsulants
used, etc. To demonstrate proof-of-concept of underwater backscatter, we followed
state-of-the-art transducer prototypes from the literature.

To build the transducer, we first soldered two wires to the two
electrodes of the piezoelectric ceramic (i.e., the inner and outer
surfaces of the cylinder). We 3D printed the base and the top cap from
Fig. 4 as well as a cylindrical mold to house the ceramic cylinder
and encapsulation polymer. We placed polyurethane washers [50]
on the top and bottom of the cylinder, then placed it on a base and
added a top cap. The washers enable the cylinder to vibrate freely
without being loaded by the end-caps. The setup is held tight using
a screw and locking nut, then placed inside the mold.
To prepare the encapsulation polymer, we used the polyurethane
WC-575A mixture from BJB enterprises [9]; this polymer was cho-
sen due to its transparency and because its acoustic impedance
maximizes the energy transfer between water and the piezoelectric
material. We prepared the polyurethane by mixing its components
as per the manufacturer’s guidelines [9] then placed the resulting
mixture inside a vacuum tank to extract any moisture or residual
air bubbles from the mixture. We poured the prepared polyurethane
into the cylindrical mold and left it to pot for 12 hours in a pressure
chamber at 60psi (4atm). Once the potting was done, we removed
the mold and added marine epoxy [45] to seal any remaining holes
and ensure that water does not leak into the transducer. We fabricated
eight of these transducers in total.
As part of our fabrication process, we also experimented with
fully-potted (i.e., non-air-backed) designs, but noticed that these
designed had poorer sensitivity and energy harvesting efficiency
than air-backed transducers. This observation is shared by past
research [28]. We also experimented with various encapsulation
thicknesses but did not observe a significant difference in their per-
formance.
4.2 Hardware Design & Fabrication
Our hardware design is entirely battery-free and was designed and
fabricated on a two-layer printed circuit board (PCB). The design
serves four primary purposes: backscatter communication (for up-
link), energy harvesting, receiving and decoding (for downlink sig-
nals), and interfacing with peripherals. This architecture enables
PAB to serve as a general-purpose and extensible platform for
battery-free underwater sensing and communication.
The overall schematic of our designs is shown in Fig. 5. We used
Autodesk Eagle design software [5] to design the schematic and
layout. A total of 20 boards were manufactured by PCBWay [55] at
the cost of $10. The circuit components were hand-soldered on the
PCBs and individually tested.
4.2.1 Mixed Analog-Digital Circuit Design
A piezoelectric resonator provides a differential output (rather than
a single-ended output with a ground). Hence, our analog front-end
adopts a differential design as can be seen in the mirrored archi-
tecture in Fig. 5, where the upper and lower portion of the energy
harvesting and backscatter units are mirror images of each other. 10
Backscatter. To enable backscatter communication, we insert two
transistors in series between the two terminals of the piezoelectric
device. The middle junction of the two transistors is connected to
ground, enabling symmetric backscatter and maximizing the SNR
10Not accounting for the differential design could lead to unstable performance since
the digital components of the design need to be grounded.

of the backscattered signal.11 The transistors act as switches to
enable toggling the piezoelectric interface between reflective and
non-reflective stages, when they are operating in short-circuit and
open-circuit modes, respectively. The gates of the transistors are
controlled by the microcontroller described in §4.2.2.
