User: I am using ubuntu with root access and have python 3.3 and 2.7 installed in my system. When I use easy_install by default it installs the package for 2.7.
How can I use it to install to 3.3 instead
Assistant: Tested on Ubuntu 14.04:
1) Use pip instead of easy_install. It's the way of the future. ;-)
2) sudo apt-get install python3-pip
3) sudo pip3 install AWESOME-PACKAGE
