I noticed a problem when wanting to have a TextField selection and then
replacing the selected text when typing.
I tried the Flutter Gallery app v0.5.1 and it has the same problem.
## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Open Flutter Gallery v0.5.1
  2. Go to Material -> Text fields
  3. Write something in the Salary input
  4. Select some numbers and then start writing new ones
I would expect the selected text to be replaced by the new one but instead it
is added before the selection. The same behavior is seen on
TextInputType.number and TextInputType.phone but not on TextInputType.text for
example.
