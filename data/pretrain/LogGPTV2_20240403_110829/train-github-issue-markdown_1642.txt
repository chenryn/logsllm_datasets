When attempting to use `exportAs` with a template-based directive, the
following behaviour occurs:
(1) **When used with`*` syntax:** You get the error "There is no directive
with "exportAs" set to "foo"" despite this not being true  
(2) **When used with`template`**: You don't get an error, but the export is
null, so any method calls or property access will error
~~The only way for the export to work is:~~
~~(1) Using``~~  
~~(2) and specifying exportAs, despite having to... [edit: not actually
necessary for workaround]~~  
~~(3) manually set the local with `ViewRef.setLocal("exportAsName", this);~~
~~Additionally, in no case is the exported variable accessible in the external
context. When set with`setLocal` it can only be accessed inside the template.
(It makes sense that setLocal only works inside the template, so this is more
a consequence of the overall divergent behaviour)~~
(While that's a workaround to get at the variable inside the template, it
doesn't constitute a "way for the export to work" since it's somewhat
unrelated feature-wise)
