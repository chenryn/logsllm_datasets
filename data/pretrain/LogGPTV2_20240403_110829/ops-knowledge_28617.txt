I have Emacs and Python set up on my macOS, but I would like to run a Python interpreter in a split window so that I can view the output as I code. Is this possible?

Thank you.

**Response:**

Certainly! You can achieve this by using the `python-mode` in Emacs. Here are the steps to open a Python interpreter in a split window:

1. Ensure you are in a buffer with a Python file (`.py`).
2. Press `C-c !` or use `M-x py-shell RET`.

This will open a Python shell in a split window, allowing you to see the output as you code. This should work with the default settings.

If you encounter any issues, make sure you have the `python-mode` package installed and properly configured. You can also customize the behavior further by adjusting your Emacs configuration if needed.

I hope this helps!
