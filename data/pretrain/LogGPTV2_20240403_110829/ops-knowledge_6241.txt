According to my understanding, Python 2.7 is natively included in macOS 10.8 and above. However, I recently installed Python 3.5 for some projects I'm working on through Udacity. To my surprise, the Udacity courses seem to use Python 2.7. Instead of attempting to uninstall Python 3.5, which seemed quite daunting for a beginner like myself, I decided to install Python 2.7 alongside the recently installed Python 3.5. Now, I just run the IDLE and Shell for Python 2.7. Is this setup okay, or could it potentially cause issues down the road?

Assistant: Having multiple versions of Python installed on your system, such as 2.7 and 3.5, is generally fine and should not cause any significant problems. Many developers, including myself, have both Python 2.7 and 3.x (e.g., 3.4, 3.5) installed on their systems for different purposes. For instance, I use Python 3.4 for my work projects in an Eclipse environment, while I use Python 2.7 for Udacity courses, similar to you.

To ensure that everything runs smoothly, you can manage the different Python versions using tools like `virtualenv` or `pyenv`. These tools allow you to create isolated environments for each project, ensuring that the correct version of Python and its dependencies are used. This way, you can avoid conflicts between different Python versions and their respective libraries.

In summary, having both Python 2.7 and 3.5 installed is perfectly acceptable, and with proper management, you should not encounter any major issues.
