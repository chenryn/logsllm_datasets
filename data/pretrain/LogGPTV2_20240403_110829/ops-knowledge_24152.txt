User: How to setup SSH login authentication and authorization? Please provide detailed steps.
Assistant: The detailed steps of SSH login authentication and authorization are as follows: 1. Generate an SSH key pair Open the command line tool on the local computer, and use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate a key pair. Enter the following command on the command line: ``` ssh-keygen -t rsa ``` Then the system will prompt: "Enter file in which to save the key", at this time you can directly press Enter without typing, and the system will save the key in the default directory. In the subsequent prompt, you can enter a password, or you can directly press Enter to skip entering the password. 2. Upload the public key to the server Copy the public key in the newly generated `id_rsa.pub` file to the `authorized_keys` file on the server, and create the file if it does not exist. 3. Configure the SSH server on the server, and set the SSH configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to only allow public key login. Open the `sshd_config` file with a text editor, find and modify the relevant lines as follows: ``` PasswordAuthentication no PubkeyAuthentication yes ``` After completion, you need to restart the SSH service. 4. Test the connection. Use the SSH client to connect to the server. The system will prompt you to enter the user name and password. At this time, you can directly enter the user name. If a prompt such as the authentication password pops up, it means that the modification has taken effect. At this time, if you successfully log in to the server, it proves that authentication and authorization have taken effect. The above are the detailed steps of SSH login authentication and authorization.
