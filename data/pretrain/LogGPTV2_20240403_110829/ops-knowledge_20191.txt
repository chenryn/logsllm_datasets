User: When executing pip3 install cryptography, pip3 gives an error:

fatal error: 'openssl/aes.h' file not found
#include <openssl/aes.h>
1 error generated.
  error: command '/usr/bin/clang' failed with exit status 1   

I checked with brew info openssl and got the answer:

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
  own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
  build variables:
LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include 

The problem now is: how can I tell pip add the paths into corresponding build variables when it uses clang to compile cpp file?
Assistant: Trying to install the scrapy I need to install cryptography package on Mac OS El Capitan. As explained in Cryptography installation doc
env LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib" CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include" pip install cryptography
