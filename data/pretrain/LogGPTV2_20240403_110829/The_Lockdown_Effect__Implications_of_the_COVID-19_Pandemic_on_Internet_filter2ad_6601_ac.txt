### Volume Statistics and Diurnal Patterns

The volume statistics for the four-week period are detailed in Table 1. For each hour of the day, we maintain separate traffic volume statistics and compare these to the corresponding day and hour of the previous month. This allows us to identify diurnal patterns and, more importantly, changes in these patterns over time.

### Top Transport Ports Analysis

We plot the top transport ports for each vantage point. The two most common ports, TCP/443 and TCP/80, account for 80% and 60% of traffic at the ISP-CE and IXP-CE, respectively. Any small changes in their traffic volume would dominate the plots. Therefore, we omit these ports from Figures 7 and 8 for clarity. Instead, we focus on the top 3–12 ports. Figure 7 illustrates the changes in traffic volume per transport-layer port for the IXP-CE, while Figure 8 does the same for the ISP-CE. Note that we aggregate the hours of all working days of a week into a single subplot. Plots for aggregated weekend days and direct comparisons with the base week of February are provided in Appendix C.

### Traffic Distribution and Changes Over Time

While both networks share similar top ports, their distribution and the changes in these distributions over time differ significantly. This reflects the different types of customers at these vantage points. The ISP-CE dataset primarily consists of subscriber traffic, which includes end-users and small enterprises, whereas the IXP-CE has a diverse set of members across the entire Internet economy. Generally, we observe a strong increase in traffic at both the IXP-CE and ISP-CE in March (leftmost subplots) compared to the more gradual changes in the following months (middle and rightmost subplots).

### Specific Port Analysis

#### QUIC (UDP/443)
QUIC, used for streaming by companies like Google and Akamai, shows a 30%–80% increase at the ISP-CE and about a 50% increase at the IXP-CE when comparing March traffic to the base week of February. The largest increase at the ISP-CE occurs in the morning hours, while the increase at the IXP-CE is more evenly distributed throughout the day. This likely reflects the behavior of families staying at home. In April and June, QUIC traffic volumes remain relatively stable, with some hours gaining traffic while others lose some.

#### NAT Traversal / IPsec / OpenVPN (UDP/4500 and UDP/1194)
Port UDP/4500, registered at IANA for IPsec NAT traversal, and Port UDP/1194, the default port for OpenVPN, show an increase during working hours at both vantage points in March. This is likely due to more people working from home and using VPNs to access their company or university networks. In April and June, traffic volumes for UDP/4507 stay above the February base week levels, while OpenVPN's volume decreases. Interestingly, GRE and ESP, which transport the actual IPsec VPN content, decrease at the IXP-CE in March during the lockdown, while GRE traffic sees a slight increase at the ISP-CE. This suggests that more people are using VPNs from home, but connections between companies, which are the primary source of GRE and ESP traffic, decrease over time.

#### TV Streaming (TCP/8200)
At the IXP-CE, port TCP/8200, used by an online streaming service for Russian TV channels, shows increased traffic volumes throughout the day in March, shifting away from an evening-centric profile. This change is mainly observed at the IXP-CE due to its broader and more international customer base. However, this strong increase does not persist in the following months.

#### Cloudflare (UDP/2408)
Port UDP/2408, used by the CDN Cloudflare for their load balancer service, shows an increase in traffic at the IXP-CE in March and June. We verify that the traffic originates from Cloudflare prefixes.

#### Video Conferencing (UDP/3480)
Skype and Microsoft Teams use port UDP/3480, likely for STUN purposes. During the lockdown in March, we see a significant increase in UDP/3480 traffic at the IXP-CE, especially during working hours. At the ISP-CE, this port does not appear among the top 12 transport layer ports. Zoom, another video conferencing solution, uses UDP/8801 for its on-premise connector. At the ISP-CE, this traffic increases by an order of magnitude from February to April, reflecting the adoption of a new application by companies deploying connectors in their local networks. Zoom traffic decreases again in June, possibly due to the vacation period resulting in fewer online office meetings.

#### Email (TCP/993)
At the ISP-CE, especially during working hours, there is a 60% increase in TCP/993, used by IMAP over TLS to retrieve emails. While the overall traffic volume is small compared to other protocols, it indicates an increase in office communication from home.

#### Unknown Port (TCP/25461)
We could not map TCP/25461 to any known protocol or service. The addresses using this port mostly reside in prefixes owned by hosting companies.

### Summary of Traffic Profile Changes
We find significant changes in the traffic profile for some popular transport-layer ports at both vantage points, highlighting the impact of drastic human behavior changes on traffic distribution during these weeks. We observe an increase in work-related and entertainment-related traffic, reflecting the lockdown where people had to work and educate from home. This is supported by the significant shift in workday patterns, especially at the ISP-CE from February to March when the lockdown began. As more people stayed at home, the traffic levels dominated by residential customers increased steeply in the morning, compared to the steady growth observed over the whole day in February.

### Application Classes Analysis

Building on the analysis of raw ports, we now provide a more in-depth analysis of traffic shifts for different application classes. This is particularly relevant for traffic using protocols such as HTTP(S), where a single transport-layer port number can hide many different applications and use cases.

To investigate application layer traffic shifts, we apply a traffic classification based on a combination of transport port and traffic source/sink criteria. We define more than 50 combinations of transport port and AS criteria based on scientific-related work, product and service documentations, and public databases.

We aggregate the filtered data into 8 meaningful application classes representing applications consumed by end-users on a daily basis (See Table 4):
- **Web Conferencing and Telephony (Web conf)**: Covers all major conferencing and telephony providers.
- **Collaborative Working**: Captures online collaboration applications.
- **Email**: Quantifies email communication.
- **Video on Demand (VoD)**: Covers major video streaming services.
- **Gaming**: Captures traffic from major gaming providers (cloud and multiplayer).
- **Social Media**: Captures traffic of the most relevant social networks.
- **Educational**: Focuses on traffic from educational networks.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)**: Classifies content delivery traffic.

### Gaming Application Class Analysis

Figure 9 showcases the Gaming class at the IXP-SE vantage point. We filter data from five gaming software/services providers and 57 typical gaming transport ports in various combinations (see Table 4). We analyze the changes in usage behavior using two metrics:
1. The number of distinct source IP addresses, approximating the order of households.
2. The traffic volume.

Figure 9 shows clear changes when comparing multiplayer and cloud games before and during the lockdown. From week 10 on, i.e., when the local government imposed a lockdown, the number of unique IPs and the delivered volumes rose steeply, with substantial gains in the daily minimum, average, and maximum. Notably, during the first lockdown week, the accounted volume plunged for two days to the lowest values observed in that timeframe. We verified that this drop correlates with an outage of a large gaming provider, possibly related to the sudden increase in users.

### Application Classification for Different Vantage Points

We perform the application classification for the different IXP vantage points (IXP-SE, IXP-CE, IXP-US) and for the ISP-CE. To clearly present the large amount of information, we transform the data as follows:
- **Week-wise Comparison**: We focus on four weeks, a base week well before the lockdown, and three weeks representing different stages of the COVID-19 measures.
- **Normalization and Filtering**: After normalization, we remove the early morning hours (2–7 am) to visualize more details of traffic shifts during the day.
- **Difference to Base Week**: We visualize each week as the difference from the base week, enabling quick visual identification of increased/decreased application class usage.

### Main Observations

#### Communication-Related Applications
- **Web Conferencing**: Shows a dramatic increase of more than 200% during business hours at all vantage points. The ISP-CE experiences the largest growth in March right after the lockdown, which lessens in June as people return to offices.
- **Collaborative Working**: Mainly increases at the IXP-SE and IXP-US. At the ISP-CE, there is a significant increase on Thursday and Friday mornings, persisting until June.
- **Email**: Declines at the IXP-CE and IXP-SE during the lockdown and remains lower in June. At the ISP-CE, email traffic rises but not as high as other traffic classes.

#### Entertainment-Related Applications
- **VoD Streaming**: Shows high growth rates at European IXPs, up to 100%. The ISP-CE only sees a slight growth of about 10% during the lockdown, with traffic dropping back to February levels in June.
- **Gaming**: Shows a strong increase across all three IXP vantage points, especially during the day. The ISP-CE shows a significant increase during morning hours but generally leans towards declining.
- **Social Media**: Increases at the IXPs during the March week but quickly diminishes in April. The ISP-CE experiences a 70% growth in March, which slows down in April but not as drastically as at the IXPs.

#### Other Applications
- **Educational Networks**: Traffic remains relatively stable at the IXP-CE but drastically increases by up to 200% at the ISP-CE, attributed to the use of video conferencing solutions by educational networks.
- **CDN Traffic**: Increases in Europe but does not grow much, even decreasing at times, in the US. This may be due to rerouting decisions by large players.

### Summary

The use of communication-related applications, especially web conferencing, increases during working hours. Entertainment-related applications such as gaming and VoD are consumed at any time of the day, becoming more demanded during the lockdown. Social media shows a strong initial increase that flattens over time. These observations complement and strengthen those made in Section 4, demonstrating the massive impact of the drastic change in human behavior caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on application usage.
