volume statistics from four weeks described in Table 1. For each
hour of the day, we keep separate traffic volume statistics and then
compare these to the respective day and hour of the previous month,
which allows us to identify diurnal patterns, and more importantly,
changes therein.
We plot the top transport ports for each vantage point. As the
two most common ports TCP/443 and TCP/80 make up 80% and 60%
of traffic at the ISP-CE and IXP-CE, respectively, any small changes
in their traffic volume would dominate the plot. Therefore, we omit
those from Figures 7 and 8 for clarity purposes. 3 We instead focus
on the top 3–12 ports. Figure 7 depicts changes in traffic volume
per transport-layer port for the IXP-CE, and Figure 8 for the ISP-CE.
Note that we aggregate the hours of day of all working days of
a week into a single subplot. Plots for aggregated weekend days
along with plots directly comparing changes to the base week of
February are shown in Appendix C.
While both networks share similar top ports, their distribution,
and the changes in these distributions over time, are very different.
3We also consider alternative HTTP port TCP/8080, rendered in the figures, but we do
not observe any significant change in its usage.
This reflects the different types of customers present at these van-
tage points. Recall, that the ISP-CE dataset consists of subscriber
traffic, which is largely composed of end-users and small enter-
prises, while the IXP-CE one has a very diverse set of members
across the entire Internet economy exchanging traffic over its plat-
form. In general, we see a very strong increase at the IXP-CE as well
as at the ISP-CE when comparing the changes in March (leftmost
subplots), compared to the more gradual changes in the following
months (middle and rightmost subplots).
Next, we analyze in-depth specific ports to more accurately at-
tribute overall changes in diurnal patterns:
QUIC: Running on port UDP/443, QUIC is mainly used for stream-
ing purposes by e.g., Google and Akamai [55]. QUIC traffic increases
30%–80% at the ISP-CE and about 50% at the IXP-CE when compar-
ing traffic volumes in March with the base week of February. Once
the lockdown starts, we see the largest increase at the ISP-CE in
the morning hours. Moreover, at the IXP-CE the increase is more
gradually distributed over the day. This likely reflects the behavior
of entire families staying at home. In the months of April and June
the traffic volumes of QUIC remain relatively stable, with some
hours gaining traffic while other losing some.
NAT traversal / IPsec / OpenVPN: Port UDP/4500 is registered
at IANA for IPsec NAT traversal and is commonly used by VPN so-
lutions, Port UDP/1194 is OpenVPN’s default port. As more people
are working from home and using VPNs to access their company
or university network, we see an increase of both ports during
working hours at the two vantage points in March. In the following
weeks in April and June the traffic volumes for UDP/4500 stay above
the traffic volume of the February base week, whereas OpenVPN’s
volume recedes. Interestingly, GRE and ESP, which transport the
actual IPsec VPN content, decrease at the IXP-CE in March during
the lockdown, while GRE traffic sees a slight increase at the ISP-CE.
To summarize, more people are using VPNs from their homes re-
sulting in an increased need of NAT traversal, but VPN connections
between companies which are the primary source of GRE and ESP
traffic decrease over time. For an in-depth analysis of VPN traffic
shifts, see Section 6.
TV streaming: On port TCP/8200 at the IXP-CE we see, similar
to QUIC, how changes in user behavior affect the traffic profile.
This port is used by an online streaming service for Russian TV
channels. In March, we notice traffic volumes increasing throughout
the day, shifting away from an evening centric traffic profile. We
mainly observe this at the IXP-CE as it serves a broader and more
international customer base. Additionally, the strong increase in
March is not persisting over the following months.
Cloudflare: Port UDP/2408 is used by the CDN Cloudflare for
their load balancer service [17]. We verify that the traffic indeed
originates from Cloudflare prefixes. During our observation period,
we see an increase in Cloudflare load balancer traffic at the IXP-CE
in March and in June.
Video conferencing: The video communication tool Skype and
the online collaboration service Microsoft Teams both use port
UDP/3480, most likely for STUN purposes [44, 45]. We confirm
this by verifying that the addresses reside in prefixes owned by
Microsoft. Additionally, we find a small number of non-Microsoft
addresses in our data. During the lockdown in March, we see a

large increase in UDP/3480 traffic at the IXP-CE, especially dur-
ing working hours on workdays. At the ISP-CE it does not show
up among the top 12 transport layer ports. Zoom, another video
conferencing solution, uses UDP/8801 for its on-premise connector
which companies can deploy to route all meeting traffic through
it [20]. At the ISP-CE this traffic increases by an order of magnitude
from February to April. Since Zoom only became popular in Europe
due to the lockdown, this drastic increase reflects the adoption of a
new application by companies deploying connectors in their local
network. These changes once again underline the fact that people
working from home do change the Internet’s traffic profile. Zoom
traffic decreases again in June, which might also be related to the
vacation period resulting in fewer online office meetings.
Email: At the ISP-CE, especially during working hours, we find a
60% increase in TCP/993, which is used by IMAP over TLS to retrieve
emails. While the overall amount of traffic is small compared to,
e.g., QUIC, it is nevertheless an additional indicator for people
conducting their usual office communication from their homes.
Unknown port: We could not map TCP/25461 to any known pro-
tocol or service. The addresses using this port mostly reside in
prefixes owned by hosting companies.
To summarize, we find significant changes in the traffic profile
for some popular transport-layer ports at both vantage points. This
highlights the impact of drastic human behavior changes on traffic
distribution during these weeks. We see an increase in work-related
as well as entertainment-related traffic, reflecting the lockdown
where people had to work and educate from home. This rationale is
supported by the significant shift in workday patterns, especially at
the ISP-CE from February to March when the lockdown began. As
more people stay at home, the traffic levels which are dominated by
residential customers increase steeply in the morning, compared to
the steady growth observed over the whole day in February.
5 APPLICATION CLASSES
Building on the analysis of the raw ports presented in the previous
section, we now provide a more in-depth analysis of traffic shifts
for different application classes. This is especially relevant for traffic
using protocols such as HTTP(S), where a single transport-layer
port number hides many different applications and use cases.
To investigate application layer traffic shifts, we apply a traffic
classification based on a combination of transport port and traffic
source/sink criteria. In total, we define more than 50 combinations
of transport port and AS criteria based on scientific-related work
[6, 60], product and service documentations [15, 28, 44, 45], and
public databases [47, 51].

We aggregate the filtered data into 8 meaningful application
classes representing applications consumed by end-users on a daily
basis (See Table 4): Web conferencing and telephony (Web conf) cov-
ers all major conferencing and telephony providers, Collaborative
working captures online collaboration applications, Email quanti-
fies email communication, Video on Demand (VoD) covers major
video streaming services, Gaming captures traffic from major gam-
ing providers (cloud and multiplayer), Social media captures traffic
of the most relevant social networks, Educational focuses on traffic
from educational networks, and Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
classifies content delivery traffic. Note that social networks, e.g.,
Facebook, also offer video telephony and content delivery services
for their own products, which may be captured by this class but
not by the more specific other classes.
Figure 9 showcases the Gaming class at the IXP-SE vantage
point. For this application class, we filter data of five gaming soft-
ware/services providers and 57 typical gaming transport ports in
various combinations (see Table 4). We then analyze the changes
in usage behavior using two metrics: (1) the number of distinct
source IP addresses, as a way to approximate the order of house-
holds, and (2) the traffic volume. Figure 9 shows clear changes
when comparing multiplayer and cloud games before and during
the lockdown. From week 10 on, i.e., when the local government
imposed a lockdown, the number of unique IPs seen in the trace as
well as the delivered volumes rose steeply with substantial gains of
the daily minimum, average, and maximum. Notably, during the
first lockdown week, the accounted volume plunges for two days
to the lowest values observed in that time frame. We verified that
this is not a measurement artifact. Instead, the drop correlates with
an outage of a large gaming provider, which may be related to the
sudden increase in users.
We perform the application classification for the different IXP
vantage points (IXP-SE, IXP-CE, IXP-US) and for the ISP-CE.4 To
clearly present the large amount of information, we transform the
data as follows.
Week-wise comparison: We focus our analysis on four weeks, a
base week well before the lockdown, to which we compare three
weeks representing the different stages of the COVID-19 measures
as they were imposed throughout Europe—see Table 1 in Section 2.
Normalization and filtering: After normalization as outlined in
Section 2, we remove the early morning hours (2–7 am). The total
volume of the vantage points hits its daily minimum during these
hours, but does not change much during the lockdown. Removing
these hours allows us to visualize more details of traffic shifts during
the day in order to compare application classes of different traffic
volumes as well as the relative growth between the base week and
the other weeks.
Difference to base week: We visualize each week as the differ-
ence of the respective week and the base week. This enables quick
visual identification of increased/decreased application class usage
compared to pre-COVID times. We remove any growth above 200%
and any decrease below 100%.
4In case of the ISP-CE we analyzed upstream as well as downstream traffic. As the
differences between the weeks manifest in both directions in a very similar fashion
we only show the downstream direction.
Figure 9: IXP-SE: Application class Gaming before and dur-
ing lockdown. It shows a steep increase in # IPs and traffic
volume.
The condensed timelines of the different application classes are
shown in Figure 10 for all four vantage points. We highlight our
main observations next:
Communication-related applications: At all vantage points, Web
conferencing applications show a dramatic increase of more than
200% during business hours, and at the ISP-CE, IXP-SE, and the IXP-
US also on the weekends. In this category the ISP-CE experiences
the largest growth in March right after the lockdown across all
hours of the day. In June this trend is less pronounced, which corre-
sponds with people slowly going back to their offices. Collaborative
working mainly increases at the IXP-SE and the IXP-US, at the ISP-
CE we see a vast increase on Thursday and Friday morning which
persists until June—this might be due to coordination between work
partners before the weekend. While in a lockdown situation one
might expect a lot of additional Email communication, we see a dif-
ferent trend. At the IXP-CE and the IXP-SE Email actually declines
during the lockdown and in June remains on a lower level than
before the lockdown. Instead, Email rises at the ISP-CE it, but not
as high as other traffic classes as Web conferencing. One possible
explanation could be that many companies start connecting their
remote employees via Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and users
connect to the mail systems via the VPN. We discuss VPN traffic in
Section 6. For the IXP-US the trend is less pronounced, and we see
phases of usage increase and decrease over time.
Entertainment related applications: VoD streaming application
usage shows high growth rates at the European IXPs of up to 100%.
Interestingly, ISP-CE only sees a slight growth of about 10% during
the lockdown, while in June – well after the lockdown – the traf-
fic volume drops back to the February level. Recall that the major

streaming companies reduced their streaming resolution in Europe
by mid-March [48] for 30 days. In the case of the ISP-CE that covers
the March as well as the April week.5 In the US, the trend is the
other way around. Notably, this may be a biased measurement, as at
the IXP-US the measurement of the VoD class is based on only three
ASes, one of which is very large. Consequently, the decrease may
reflect a traffic engineering decision of the large AS, e.g., establish-
ing a private network interconnect instead of peering. The strong
growth of gaming applications is more coherent across all three IXP
vantage points, especially during the day. While the ISP-CE shows
a significant increase during morning hours, it generally leans to-
wards declining. Note, that this effect is mainly caused by unusually
high traffic levels in this category in February. Gaming applications,
typically used in the evening or at weekends, are now used at any

VoD providers are beyond the scope of this work.
time. The trend starts to flatten in June—this may in relation with
people going on vacation or spending more time outside. Moreover,
we see an increase at the IXPs for Social media application traffic
during the March week, while the effect quickly diminishes in April.
In March the ISP experiences a 70% growth, which slows down in
April but not as drastic as at the IXPs. The effects in this class corre-
late with the gradual de-escalation of the lockdown restrictions in
Europe: as people are allowed to leave their homes freely again and
resume social live, this traffic decreases. In June, social media usage
has returned to figures slightly below the level of March across all
vantage points.
Other applications: Educational networks and applications be-
have completely different at all vantage points. At the IXP-CE, their
traffic remains relatively stable —as would be expected given stu-
dents attending classes from home—, but at the ISP-CE, instead, it
drastically increases by up to 200%. This growth could be attributed

to some European educational networks providing video confer-
encing solutions, which are now being used by customers of the
ISP-CE. Due to the lack of connected educational networks at the
IXP-US, we omit this category at this vantage point. See Section 7
for an in-depth study of the traffic shifts in a large educational net-
work. Likewise, CDN traffic increases in Europe, but does not grow
much—even decreasing at times—in the US. Similar to VoD, there is
a skewed distribution of CDNs present at the vantage point. Thus,
a rerouting decision of a large player may explain the moderate
loss of CDN traffic at the IXP-US.
To summarize, the use of communication-related applications
increase during working hours, especially in Web conferencing. En-
tertainment related applications such as gaming and VoD are also
consumed at any time of the day, as the become more demanded dur-
ing the lockdown. Social media shows a strong initial increase which
flattens over time. These observations complement and strengthen
those made in Section 4. Together, they demonstrate the massive
impact that the drastic change in human behavior caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic had on application usage.
