It is currently quiet hard to test modifications within custom error pages. It
involves the following steps:
  1. Make the exception controller use the right template:  
When in development mode the exception controller defaults to use a template
called "exception_". In production it searches for "error_". So you either
need to switch to production locally or rename your template temporarily. When
switching to production locally Twig will start to cache the compiled
templates. So you even need to clear the cache after each modification or
deactivate caching in your Twig configuration. It is ugly anyway.
  2. Trigger an exception  
To actually see the error page, an exception has to be thrown. This might
still be easy for 404 exceptions
(http://localhost/app.php/there/is/no/page/here...), but is more difficult for
other exception types (e.g. 403, 500).
Suggestion:
  1. The exception controller should offer a way to make him use the "production" templates within development mode. This could be a configuration variable in TwigBundle.
  2. We could offer routes for exception tests in development mode (e.g. /_exceptions-test/403). This routes would start a controller that just throws the specified exception.  
It would be even nicer if calling the test route would implicitly switch to
"production" templates without having to reconfigure TwigBundle.
I have already had a look into TwigBundle and could provide a PR if you like
the idea.
Or am I overseeing something existing?
