User: How to optimize the performance of a web application to reduce response time and resource consumption?
Assistant: 1. Reduce HTTP requests: Combine CSS and JavaScript files, and use CSS Sprites to reduce image requests. 2. Cache component: Use technologies such as browser cache, ETag or Last-Modified response header. 3. Compressed content: Use Gzip and other technologies to compress the transmitted data to reduce transmission time and resource consumption. 4. Reduce the number of DOM operations: Avoid frequently modifying the DOM structure and style, and reduce DOM operations as much as possible. 5. Use asynchronous loading: Use techniques such as Ajax and defer attributes to load large or slow content asynchronously. 6. Reduce redirection: Avoid excessive HTTP redirection and return request responses directly. 7. Optimize the code: reduce unnecessary calculations and cycles, and reduce the amount of code and the number of function calls as much as possible. 8. Use CDN: Use content distribution network (CDN) to provide static resources, reducing server load and bandwidth consumption. 9. Optimize images: Compress image size, use appropriate image formats (such as JPEG, PNG, etc.), and avoid scaling images in HTML. 10. Reduce the use of plug-ins: avoid excessive Flash and Java plug-ins, and use HTML5 and CSS3 technologies as much as possible.
