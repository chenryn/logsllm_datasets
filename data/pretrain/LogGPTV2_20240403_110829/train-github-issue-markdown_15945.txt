When using the DecisionTreeClassifier() sample_weight parameter, and weighting
examples by class lable such as 2:1 for class A versus class B, the
**nvalues** in the leaves of the tree produced by tree.export_graphviz() shows
a duplicate count for the number of examples for the weighted class.
This is misleading because the sum of each classes **nvalues** should equal
the total number of examples in the parent node. It seems that there is a bug
where the feature weighting factor is not removed when exporting the decision
tree.
Here is the classifier with weighting:
    clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(
        criterion='gini', splitter='best', max_leaf_nodes=10,
        min_samples_split=10, min_samples_leaf=2, max_features=None,
        random_state=None).fit(X, y, sample_weight=df.LABEL.map({'A':2, 'B':1})) 
Here is the produced tree.dot file with the duplicate values shown in **bold**
:
digraph Tree {  
0 [label="X[106]  1 ;  
3 [label="gini = 0.0578\nsamples = 111941\nvalue = [ **210926**. 6478.]",
shape="box"] ;  
1 -> 3 ;  
4 [label="gini = 0.2103\nsamples = 6366\nvalue = [ **10016**. 1358.]",
shape="box"] ;  
1 -> 4 ;  
2 [label="X[83]  2 ;  
5 [label="gini = 0.4994\nsamples = 364\nvalue = [ **254**. 237.]",
shape="box"] ;  
2 -> 5 ;  
6 [label="gini = 0.1669\nsamples = 706\nvalue = [ **68**. 672.]", shape="box"]
;  
2 -> 6 ;  
}
Here is what the tree looks like with duplicate leaf example counts for the
weighted class:
