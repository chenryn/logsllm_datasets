I really like push and pull from http://960.gs/demo.html (bottom row)
Why? Well push is offset but pull makes it possible to show the viewer Left
Middle Right but in the code it can be Middle Left Right. This is good for
schreen readers, page starts straight on topic, menu later (only hidden go to
menu link for screenreader is needed for screen reader). Pull is also good for
the responsive design, let say Middle is your logo and you have a quote on the
Left and Right and on a mobile you want the logo (Middle) first then you need
to push Middle by 4 and pull Left by 4.
Example:
        Middle
        Left
        Right
