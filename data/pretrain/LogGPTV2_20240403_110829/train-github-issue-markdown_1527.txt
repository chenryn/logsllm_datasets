I really appreciate the push and pull features demonstrated on the 960 Grid System demo page (bottom row). 

**Why?**

- **Push** allows for an offset, while **pull** enables a more flexible content arrangement. With these features, you can present content to the viewer in a Left-Middle-Right order, even though the HTML structure is Middle-Left-Right. This is particularly beneficial for screen readers, as it ensures that the main content is read first, followed by the menu. A hidden "go to menu" link can be added specifically for screen readers.

- **Pull** is also advantageous for responsive design. For example, if you have a layout where the middle column contains your logo, and the left and right columns contain quotes, you can use pull to ensure that on mobile devices, the logo (middle) appears first, followed by the left and right content. To achieve this, you would push the middle column by 4 units and pull the left column by 4 units.

**Example:**

```
Middle
Left
Right
```

This approach enhances both accessibility and user experience across different devices.
