What is the “Cloud”
What can I do in the cloud?
What’s required to start?
Cloud Computing?
• Is it a useful tool?
• Or a WMD?
Cloud Computing WMD
• Outline
• Threat Agents
– Who and why?
• Attacks
– Command and 
Control
– Attack Types
– Results
• Defenses
– Incident Response
Threat Agents
• Who are they?
– Business Rivals
– Organized Crime
– Foreign Powers
Motivates
• What do they want?
– Bragging Rights
– Money
– Power
Power
Terms
• DDoS
– Distributed Denial of 
Service Attack
• Fragmentation Attack
• TCP Syn Flood
– Sending packets with 
only the Syn bit set, and 
not listening for a 
response
Typical Command And Control
• Who is your herder?
– Typical CNC 
– Herder
• Controller or Scripts
– Bots
• Infected Clients
• Lots of Hosts (Millions?)
• Requires lots of time
• Most systems are Windows
Command And Control
Thunder Clap
• Its a proof of concept 
• Run DDoS attacks 
from the cloud
• Can use social media 
as herder
• Rapid deployment 
and ramp up of 
systems
New Command And Control
• Who is your herder?
– Cloud is Herder and Botnet
– Bandwidth is plentiful
• Less dispersed
• Little prep time
– Control of attack
• Social Media
• Anonymous
• Hard to track
Command And Control
Attack Types
• TCP Full Connection
– Could be less effective; not 
stealthy
• Packet Fragmentation
– Not implemented in proof-of-
concept
• TCP Syn Flood
– Dangerous, but requires some 
serious bandwidth
What can we do with this?
• Target a website, server, or service
• Target multiple components or sites
• Potentially target distributed 
systems
• Run a lowlife blackmail scheme (we 
won’t but, organized crime might)
• Sell DDoS services to your 
competitors
• Ensure your website is down, for 
good.
Outcome
• Threat agents can hold 
your environment 
hostage
– Easily
– Cheaply
– Who watching again?
ThunderClap
Create Environment
• Get credit card
• Create machine image
– Include dependencies
• Deploy zombies
Development
• Create tools
– Scapy
– Hping
– Libdnet
• Develop attacks
– TCP Full
– Syn No Data
– Random Source IP?
Boom – pwnt!
D00D, we is 1337 
Outcome?
• Profit
• A series of tubes…
Inter workings of TC
Attack!
Work to be done?
Defense?
• How can you protect yourself?
Incident Response
• CSIRT Teams?
• NIST 800-61 Incident Response
Could Computing Pros
• Cloud computing is nimble
– Provides agility to start ups
– Easy to deploy large numbers of 
servers
– Cost effective for small company
– Only requires a credit card
– Storage, CloudFront, Queues, etc
Cloud Computing Cons
•
"Storing data yourself, on your own computers—
without relying on the cloud—is the most legally 
secure way to handle your private information, 
generally requiring a warrant and prior notice. The 
government asserts that it can subpoena your data 
from cloud computing providers, with no prior 
notice to you.“  -Granick and Opsahl, EFF 
• No monitoring or response
• Quick and nimble server deployment
• Low cost to run effective DDoS
• Use stolen credit card for environment
Unmonitored…
• We could end up 
with the next large 
scale attack in the 
clouds.
Conclusion
• Unmonitored – IDS/IPS?
• Cloud allows for quick and 
nimble deployments
• Reduce your server costs
• Your data can be 
subpoenaed with our your 
consent or knowledge
• What about logging?
