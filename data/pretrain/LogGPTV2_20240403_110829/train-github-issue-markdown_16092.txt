### Model description
Hi,
My name is Alexander, I am writing to you on behalf of Silero, a company
maintaining our project silero-models.  
We noticed that our models are rehosted here -
https://huggingface.co/spaces/pytorch/silero_tts or here
https://huggingface.co/spaces?search=silero.  
We did not explicitly grant Hugging Face, Inc. any sort of permission to
rehost, relicense and profit from our work and models.  
Moreover it openly disregards our CC BY-NC-SA license.  
Please immediately remove any of our models from your website and / or any of
your resources.
Best,  
Alexander
