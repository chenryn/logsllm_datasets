I am planning to start a mid-sized web project and am seeking recommendations for a suitable language and framework. I have experience with Java and Python and am looking for something straightforward.

### Considerations
- **Simplicity**: I prefer a simple and easy-to-use solution.
- **App Engine**: I am considering Google App Engine (GAE) due to its simplicity and free hosting. However, I have some concerns:
  - **Datastore Performance**: How does the GAE datastore compare in terms of speed to a standard SQL database?
  - **Full-Text Search**: Is it feasible to implement full-text search in the GAE datastore?
  - **Filtering Objects**: Can I filter objects by multiple parameters efficiently?

### Alternatives
- **Java with Stripes**: I am also considering using Java with the Stripes framework. Should I use an additional framework for database operations?

### Update
Thank you for the advice. After careful consideration, I have decided to use Django with Eclipse/PyDev as my IDE. 

**Reasons for Choosing Django:**
- **Simplicity and Elegance**: Python and Django are both simple and elegant.
- **Widespread Use and Documentation**: Django is widely used and has excellent documentation.
- **Flexibility**: Although I may need to purchase a VPS, porting the project to App Engine later, which offers some free hosting, should be relatively straightforward.

### Feedback on App Engine
While the GAE datastore might not be a significant issue, there are operational limitations that could pose challenges. For example:
- **HTTP Request Timeouts**: HTTP requests must complete within 10 seconds. If a web service you depend on occasionally takes longer than this, it could cause problems.
- **Inflexibility**: You cannot pay to increase the timeout limit.

### Conclusion
It is crucial to thoroughly understand the limitations of GAE before committing to it. Ensure that these constraints will not hinder your project's requirements.
