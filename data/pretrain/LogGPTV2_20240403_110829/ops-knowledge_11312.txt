User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Are users meant to hash their passwords? When a user logs into their account on my server, should they send their raw data to me, and then I bcrypt compare them, or are they supposed to hash and and I directly compare?

I ask this because someone posted about hashing on mobiles being slow.
It would make send to take load off of the server, and make sense about the slowing down brute forcing, and also protect the user from snooping.

If I were to do this, wouldn't I run into the exact same problem - slow experience for mobile users, if so is it something that is just expected as part of logging in. Also, wouldn't the user generate a random hash which wouldn't match the one stored in my database?

Assistant: Users should not hash their passwords before sending it to a website. If the user hashes and sends the hashes credentials, the hash is acting exactly like a password and actually defeating the purpose of hashing. If an attacker steals your password hashes, they can just send those to your server to login.

You must hash server side.
