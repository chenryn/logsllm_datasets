 **Description**
Host the helm chart in `/chart` directory on artifacthub or any helm registry.
**Use case / motivation**
I want to be able to install this helm chart from a helm repository instead of
having to maintain a private repo that I manually sync with the upstream.
**Are you willing to submit a PR?**
I can create a PR to generate a helm chart repo using Github Pages, but this
is not ideal for something as mature as Airflow.
