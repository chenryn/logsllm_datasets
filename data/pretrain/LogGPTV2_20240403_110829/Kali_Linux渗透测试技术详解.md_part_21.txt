### Creating and Configuring OpenVAS SSL Certificates

This script will now prompt you for the necessary information to create the SSL certificate for OpenVAS. Please note that this information will **NOT** be transmitted to any external party (it remains local), but it can be retrieved by anyone who can connect to your OpenVAS daemon.

1. **CA Certificate Lifetime (in days) [1460]:**
   - Set the lifetime of the CA certificate.
   
2. **Server Certificate Lifetime (in days) [365]:**
   - Set the lifetime of the server certificate.
   
3. **Country (two-letter code) [DE]:**
   - Enter your country code.
   
4. **State or Province Name [none]:**
   - Enter your state or province name.
   
5. **Location (e.g., town) [Berlin]:**
   - Enter your city or location.
   
6. **Organization [OpenVAS Users United]:**
   - Enter your organization's name.

If you do not wish to configure a specific field, simply press `Enter` to accept the default value. After providing the required information, the following message will be displayed:

```
Creation of the OpenVAS SSL Certificate
Congratulations! Your server certificate was properly created.
The following files were created:
- Certification Authority:
  - Certificate: /var/lib/openvas/CA/cacert.pem
  - Private Key: /var/lib/openvas/private/CA/cakey.pem
- OpenVASServer:
  - Certificate: /var/lib/openvas/CA/servercert.pem
  - Private Key: /var/lib/openvas/private/CA/serverkey.pem
```

Press `Enter` to exit the program.

### Synchronizing and Updating the OpenVAS NVT Database

To synchronize the OpenVAS NVT database and update the latest vulnerability checks, use the following command:

```bash
root@kali:/usr/share/openvas# openvas-nvt-sync
```

The output will show the synchronization process, including the download and verification of the NVT feed. For example:

```
[i] This script synchronizes an NVT collection with the ‘OpenVAS NVT Feed’.
[i] The ‘OpenVAS NVT Feed’ is provided by 'The OpenVAS Project'.
[i] NVT dir: /var/lib/openvas/plugins
[i] rsync is not recommended for the initial sync. Falling back on http.
[j] will use wget
[i] Using GNU wget: /usr/bin/wget
[i] Downloading to: /tmp/openvas-nvt-sync.xAKyyzYVdT/openvas-feed-2014-04-25-8214.tar.bz2
...
[i] Download complete
[i] Checking dir: ok
[i] Checking MD5 checksum: ok
```

### Creating a Client Certificate

To create a client certificate, use the following command:

```bash
root@kali:/usr/share/openvas# openvas-mkcert-client -n om -i
```

You will be prompted to enter information for the Distinguished Name (DN). After providing the required information, the certificate will be generated, and the user `om` will be added to OpenVAS.

### Rebuilding the Database

To rebuild the OpenVAS database, use the following command:

```bash
root@kali:/usr/share/openvas# openvasmd --rebuild
```

There will be no output if the operation is successful.

### Starting the OpenVAS Scanner and Loading Plugins

To start the OpenVAS scanner and load all plugins, use the following command:

```bash
root@kali:/usr/share/openvas# openvassd
```

The output will indicate that all plugins have been loaded.

### Creating a Backup of the Database

To create a backup of the OpenVAS database, use the following command:

```bash
root@kali:/usr/share/openvas# openvasmd --backup
```

There will be no output if the operation is successful.

### Adding Users

#### Adding an Admin User

To add an admin user, use the following command:

```bash
root@kali:/usr/share/openvas# openvasad -c 'add_user' -n openvasadmin -r Admin
```

You will be prompted to set a password for the new user.

#### Adding a Regular User

To add a regular user, use the following command:

```bash
root@kali:/usr/share/openvas# openvas-adduser
```

You will be prompted to enter the user's login, password, and rules. After providing the required information, the user will be added.

### Configuring Ports

To configure the ports for OpenVAS, use the following commands:

```bash
root@kali:/usr/share/openvas# openvasmd -p 9390 -a 127.0.0.1
root@kali:/usr/share/openvas# openvasad -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9393
root@kali:/usr/share/openvas# gsad --http-only --listen=127.0.0.1 -p 9392
```

### Accessing the OpenVAS Web Interface

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:9392/` to access the OpenVAS login interface. Log in using the credentials you created.

### Automating OpenVAS Startup

To automate the startup process, create a Bash script named `OpenVAS.sh` in the `/root` directory with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
openvas-nvt-sync
openvassd
openvasmd --rebuild
openvasmd --backup
openvasmd -p 9390 -a 127.0.0.1
openvasad -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9393
gsad --http-only --listen=127.0.0.1 -p 9392
```

Make the script executable and run it to start OpenVAS with a single command.

### Creating Scan Configurations and Tasks

1. **Creating a New Scan Configuration:**
   - Navigate to `Configuration > ScanConfigs`.
   - Click on `New Scan Config` and set the desired configuration.
   - Save the configuration.

2. **Creating a New Target:**
   - Navigate to `Configuration > Targets`.
   - Click on `New Target` and set the target details.
   - Save the target.

Now, you are ready to perform various vulnerability scans using the configured settings.
