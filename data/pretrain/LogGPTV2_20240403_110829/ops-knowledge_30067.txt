User: How to configure the network in the virtualization environment? Please provide at least two network configuration solutions, and explain the pros and cons and implementation methods respectively.
Assistant: Answer: There are generally two schemes for network configuration in a virtualized environment: physical network-based configuration schemes and virtual network-based configuration schemes. 1. Configuration scheme based on physical network: The configuration scheme based on physical network is to completely hand over the network in the virtualization environment to the management of the physical network. The specific implementation method is to divide the VLAN between the virtualization server and the physical network switch, and assign different virtual machines to different VLANs, so as to realize the isolation between the virtual machines. The advantage of this solution is that it is easy to use, does not require excessive technical knowledge, and does not require additional equipment and software. The disadvantage is that it cannot provide rich network functions, such as load balancing, virtual firewall, etc., and when the number of virtualized servers increases, management may become complicated. 2. Configuration scheme based on virtual network: The configuration scheme based on virtual network is to create an independent virtual network in a virtualized environment, which is partially or completely isolated from the physical network. The specific implementation method is generally to manage and configure the virtual network through virtualization technologies such as virtual switches and virtual network cards. The advantage of this solution is that it can provide virtual machines with richer network functions, such as load balancing, virtual firewall, etc., and can manage the network between virtual machines more flexibly. The disadvantage is that certain technical knowledge and additional equipment and software are required, and it may also have a certain impact on the performance of virtualization. Implementation method: The configuration scheme based on the physical network is relatively simple to implement, and only needs to divide VLANs between the virtualized server and the physical network switch. The specific steps are as follows: (1) Configure the necessary parameters such as IP address, subnet mask, and gateway for the virtualization server and the physical network switch, and ensure that the two can communicate normally; (2) Create different VLANs for different virtual machines, And specify a unique VLAN ID for each VLAN; (3) Bind the virtual network cards in the virtualization server to corresponding VLANs respectively. The configuration scheme based on the virtual network needs to be configured according to different virtualization platforms. Taking the VMware virtualization platform as an example, the implementation steps are as follows: (1) Create a virtual switch that will serve as the core of the virtual network, and multiple virtual port groups can be created to isolate the virtual network; The virtual machine creates a virtual network card and connects it to a virtual port group of the virtual switch; (3) assigns a different VLAN ID to each virtual port group in the virtual switch, and performs corresponding network configuration. The above two network configuration solutions in the virtualization environment have their own advantages and disadvantages. Which method to choose depends on the specific situation and needs.
