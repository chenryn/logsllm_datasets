supports  the  positive  results  for  heterogeneous  redundancy  in 
[14]. 
this  reward  weighting, 
This process was repeated for multiple mission times from 
500  to  10000  time  units,  in  steps  of  500,  and  the  set  of  time-
dependent rewards obtained for each configuration was plotted 
over  time.  Figure  6  shows  the  time-dependent  area-throughput 
reward  for  each  configuration.  It  is  clear  that  the  reward  falls 
over time, which is to be expected since more faults are likely to 
occur for longer mission times. However, the slopes of the lines 
are small and nearly equal, and hence the curves are unlikely to 
cross for reasonable system lifetimes. 
Figure 6 leads to some interesting conclusions with regard 
to  the  relative  efficiency  of  the  various  configurations,  which 
could  be  used  to  help  drive  the  design  process.  Configurations 
C6  and  C1,  neither  of  which  have  any  redundancy,  show  the 
two best area-throughput-reliability rewards. This indicates that 
the  additional  reliability/throughput  rewards  provided  by 
redundancy is not great enough to offset the added area. Instead, 
the fault tolerance provided by rescheduling alone is sufficient. 
Another surprising observation is that if component redundancy 
is  desired,  adding  a  single  adder  spare  provides  significantly 
greater overall reward than adding a spare multiplier or flexible 
unit.  It  is  unlikely  that  these  conclusions  would  have  been 
reached, much less formally verified, during the design process 
without  the  use  of  the  proposed  Markov  Reward  Model 
approach.

Figure 6. Expected reward over time
The  key  contribution  of  this  work  is  the  introduction  of  a 
novel  Markov  Reward  Model  that  enables  designers  to  define 
and  prioritize  system  metrics  and  evaluate  various  design 
options against those metrics. This paper focused specifically on 
the  design  of  synchronous  dataflow  systems  and  combining 
reliability  analysis  with  performance  and  area  analysis.  The 
formal  methodology  presented  calls  for  the  construction  of 
Markov  chain  system  reliability  models  for  various  design 
options  in  the  presence  of  possible  component  failures.  The 
performance  (specifically  throughput)  of  the  system  at  each 
state  in  a  chain  is  determined  using  high-level  synthesis 
techniques,  and 
is  analyzed  for  each 
configuration.  The  cumulative  reward  (based  on  a  designer-
defined weighting of performance and area) for a chain is then 
used to evaluate design options against each other. A case study 
on an FIR filter reveals how the methodology would be applied 
in  the  system  design  process, including how the models reveal 
properties  of  system  options 
that  would  otherwise  go 
undiscovered.
