### Introduction and Context
The findings presented here support the positive results for heterogeneous redundancy as discussed in [14]. This section delves into the reward weighting process, which was repeated for multiple mission times ranging from 500 to 10,000 time units, with increments of 500. The set of time-dependent rewards obtained for each configuration was then plotted over time.

### Results and Analysis
**Figure 6** illustrates the time-dependent area-throughput reward for each configuration. It is evident that the reward decreases over time, a phenomenon that can be attributed to the increased likelihood of faults occurring during longer mission durations. However, the slopes of the lines are small and nearly equal, suggesting that the curves are unlikely to intersect within reasonable system lifetimes.

**Figure 6** provides several interesting insights regarding the relative efficiency of the various configurations, which can be valuable in guiding the design process. Configurations C6 and C1, both lacking any redundancy, exhibit the highest area-throughput-reliability rewards. This indicates that the additional reliability and throughput benefits provided by redundancy do not sufficiently offset the added area. Instead, the fault tolerance achieved through rescheduling alone appears to be sufficient.

Another notable observation is that if component redundancy is desired, adding a single adder spare yields significantly greater overall reward compared to adding a spare multiplier or flexible unit. These conclusions would likely have been difficult to reach, let alone formally verify, without the use of the proposed Markov Reward Model approach.

### Conclusion
The key contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel Markov Reward Model that allows designers to define and prioritize system metrics and evaluate various design options against these metrics. This paper focuses on the design of synchronous dataflow systems, integrating reliability analysis with performance and area analysis. The formal methodology involves constructing Markov chain system reliability models for different design options, considering possible component failures. The performance (specifically throughput) of the system at each state in the chain is determined using high-level synthesis techniques. The cumulative reward, based on a designer-defined weighting of performance and area, is used to compare design options. A case study on an FIR filter demonstrates how this methodology can be applied in the system design process, revealing properties of system options that might otherwise go undiscovered.
