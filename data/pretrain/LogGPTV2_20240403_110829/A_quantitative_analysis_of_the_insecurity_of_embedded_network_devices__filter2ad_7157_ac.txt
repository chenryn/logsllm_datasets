Using the MaxMind GeoIP database[2], we categorized all
discovered candidate and vulnerable embedded devices ac-
cording to the continent in which they are located. Figure
6 shows the distribution of all discovered embedded devices
(top) and the distribution of vulnerable embedded devices
(bottom) across 6 continents. Table 4 shows the total num-
ber of candidate embedded devices as well as the correspond-
ing vulnerability rate within each continent.
– Asia represents the continent with the most number
of candidate embedded devices and accounts for ap-
proximately 80% of all discovered vulnerable embed-
ded devices.
– South Korea contains the largest number vulnerable
embedded devices out of all monitored nations.
– While 33% of all discovered candidate embedded de-
vices reside within North America, only 12% of all
vulnerable embedded devices are found there.

Using the MaxMind GeoIP Organization database[2], we
categorized all monitored network ranges into 17,427 indi-
vidual organizations. This was then divided into 4 general
organization types; Educational, Internet Service Provider
(ISP), Private Enterprise, and Government. 9118 organi-
zations could not be accurately classiﬁed, and were left in
Unidentiﬁed category. Figure 7 shows the distribution of all
discovered embedded devices (top) and the distribution of
vulnerable embedded devices (bottom) across the 5 organi-
zation types. Table 5 shows the total number of candidate
embedded devices as well as the corresponding vulnerability
rate within each organization type.
– ISP networks contain the most number of candidate
embedded devices and house over 68% of all discovered
vulnerable embedded devices.
– While Educational networks contain only a modest
number of candidate embedded devices, it has the high-
est per category vulnerability rate of 32.83%

5.4 Community Response to Default Creden-
tial Scanner Activity
The default credential scanner is designed to direct inter-
ested parties to a public webpage which describes the intent
and methodology of our project[3]. Each IP address used by
the scanner also hosts a public HTTP server which redirects
visitors to the public project webpage. We tracked access
to this webpage using Google Analytics as a way to gauge
the global community’s awareness of our scanning activities.
Figure 8 shows the number and geographical distribution of
visitors over the past six months. The initial spike of visitors
in October 2009 coincided with the publication of an article
regarding preliminary results of our project [8]. Since then,
our continuous scanning activity attracted 87 visitors over
the last 5 months.

Table 6 shows a breakdown of all communications between
the operators of the networks monitored by our scanner and
our research team. The conversations were all initiated by
the counter-party via email, usually requesting further in-
formation or to be excluded from the scan. We answered
36 conversations in total, 14 of which requested certain IP
ranges to be permanently excluded. 1,798 /24 networks were
excluded as a result of these requests. 61% of all interested
parties which detected our scanning activity and contacted
us decided to allow the scan to continue. The geographi-
cal location of the counter-parties correlates closely to the
heat map in Figure 8. We did not receive any correspon-
dence from ISP organizations or organizations from Asia,
even though the majority of vulnerable devices were discov-
ered within such IP ranges.
5.5 Preliminary Longitudinal Results
Table 7 shows the preliminary results of our longitudinal
study. We retested 102,896 vulnerable embedded devices
discovered at the end of December, 2009. As of April 20,
2010, 54,429 of the retested devices are still publicly acces-
sible, out of which 52,661 devices remain vulnerable.
In other words, approximately 96.75% of accessible vul-
nerable devices are still vulnerable after a 4 month period,
and factory default credentials have been removed from only
3.25% of the same set of devices.
6. REMEDIATION STRATEGY
The least sophisticated attacker modeled in this exper-
iment can be defeated by simply discontinuing the use of
well-known default credentials on embedded devices. How-
ever, the overall cost of implementing this naive mitigation
strategy will likely be quite high in reality. In the unlikely
event that all embedded device manufacturers universally
agree to discontinue the use of well-known default passwords
henceforth, we are still faced with the challenge of retroac-
tively ﬁxing the vulnerable legacy embedded devices in use
throughout the world today. Therefore, it is reasonable to
assume that the embedded security threat will likely per-
sist and grow endemically for the near future. In order to
eﬀectively reduce the total population of vulnerable embed-
ded devices in the wild, we must carefully consider the best
methods for securing existing legacy devices. Since exist-
ing devices are by deﬁnition under the administrative con-
trol of some individual or organization, successful mitigation
strategies must actively engage these network operators in
order to ﬁx the problem.
According to the data presented in Section 5, a few groups
of network operators contribute disproportionally large num-
bers of vulnerable embedded devices to the global popula-
tion. For example, we discovered over 300,000 vulnerable
embedded devices operating in homogenous environments
within two ISP networks in Asia. Overall, embedded de-
vices operated by residential ISPs constitute over 68% of
the entire vulnerable population. Since ISPs centrally man-
age large numbers of vulnerable embedded devices, they are
the ideal candidates to engage to mitigate the embedded
security threat.
While immediately eﬀective, engaging individual organi-
zations and manufacturers to ﬁx pockets of vulnerable de-
vices can only impede the growth of the embedded security
threat but not solve it. In order to improve categorically the
security posture of both new and legacy embedded devices,
we must develop methods of delivering eﬀective host-based
protection onto large numbers of proprietary embedded de-
vices running heterogeneous operating systems. We believe
that a novel, injectable code structure called Parasitic Em-
bedded Machines (PEM) [12] currently under development
by the Columbia Intrusion Detection Systems Lab provides
a viable solution to this challenging problem.
7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
We presented the ﬁrst quantitative measurement of em-
bedded device insecurity on a global scale as well as a pre-
liminary longitudinal study tracking vulnerable embedded
devices over a 4 month period. We developed an embed-
ded device default credential scanner capable of eﬃciently
and safely identifying vulnerable embedded devices on the
network. The scanner does this by testing whether one can
remotely login into a device using its well-known manufac-
turer supplied default credentials. Using this scanner, which
currently monitors 73 common embedded device types, we
identify over 540,000 publicly accessible vulnerable devices
in 144 countries. Vulnerable embedded devices were discov-
ered in 17,427 unique organizations on 6 continents including
government, ISP, private enterprise, educational and satel-

lite provider networks. Preliminary results from our longi-
tudinal study tracked 102,896 vulnerable devices discovered
in December 2009. Out of the 54,429 devices currently on-
line from the original population, 96.75% such devices still
remain vulnerable today. By breaking down the observed
vulnerable embedded device population across functional,
geographical and organizational categories, we were able to
identify key groups which contribute a disproportionately
large number of vulnerable devices to the global popula-
tion. Lastly, using observations derived from the presented
data, we proposed a set of realistic mitigation strategies to
eﬀectively reduce the total population of vulnerable embed-
ded devices. This study demonstrates that there is a very
large population of trivially vulnerable embedded devices
available for exploitation by the least sophisticated adver-
sary. We posit that the size of this vulnerable population
can be signiﬁcantly increased by escalating the level of so-
phistication of the assumed attacker. Since no widely avail-
able host-based defenses exist, vulnerable embedded devices
constitute a serious and pervasive security problem.
