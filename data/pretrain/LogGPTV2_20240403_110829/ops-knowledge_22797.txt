User: 当CPU使用率超过50%时，请编写一段Shell脚本，定期检查并将CPU使用率较高的进程信息输出到日志中。
Assistant: #!/bin/bash

# Set the threshold value for CPU usage
THRESHOLD=50

# Set the interval for checking CPU usage (in seconds)
INTERVAL=60

# Set the log file name
LOGFILE=/var/log/high-cpu.log

while true; do
    # Check the current CPU usage for all processes and sort by CPU usage
    PROCESSES=$(ps -eo pid,comm,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | awk '{if($3 > '$THRESHOLD') print}')

    # If there are any processes with CPU usage over the threshold, log them to the file
    if [ -n "$PROCESSES" ]; then
        echo "$(date) - High CPU usage detected:" >> $LOGFILE
        echo "$PROCESSES" >> $LOGFILE
    fi

    # Wait for the next interval
    sleep $INTERVAL
done

# Save this script as "high-cpu.sh" and make it executable (chmod +x high-cpu.sh).
# You can then run it in the background using nohup ./high-cpu.sh &
