##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.1.0.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = ['/usr/share/custom_modules']
##### CONFIGURATION
    pipelining = True
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
CentOS Linux release 7.0.1406 (Core)
##### SUMMARY
When using the synchronize module with become and delegate_to, user that
initiated playbook (root) is used when trying to ssh to target host rather
than the specified become_user.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
  1. Create ansible task as shown below
  2. Run playbook
    --- 
    - hosts: hosta:hostb 
      gather_facts: no
      tasks:
        - name: Copy folder from one server to another
          synchronize:
            mode: push
            src: "/tmp/foo/"
            dest: "/tmp/foo"
          delegate_to: "hosta"
          become: yes
          become_user: app_user
          become_method: su
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
/tmp/foo is synchronized from hosta to hostb as user app_user
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
As shown below, tries to authenticate on target system as root user rather
than app_user
    Too many authentication failures for root\r\nrsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]\nrsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at io.c(600) [sender=3.0.6]\n", "rc": 255}
I tested in 2.0.0.2 and worked ok, in 2.0.2.0 it didn't work, and does not
work in latest 2.1.
As a workaround, can add following option to synchronize module
    rsync_opts: --rsh "ssh -l app_user -i /app/home/app_user/.ssh/id_rs
This forces the delegated machine to use the key/user already established when
performing the rsync.
