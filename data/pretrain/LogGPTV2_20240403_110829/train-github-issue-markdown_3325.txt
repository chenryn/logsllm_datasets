I understand that the package system is under heavy development, but I cannot
install either Distributions nor Gadfly, because Pkg is finding dependencies
that are not present in the .julia directory (nor anywhere else for that
matter) and I haven't the foggiest about how to fix this because I don't know
how the package system works without reading the code for it. It would be
great if I didn't have to post on the mailing list asking how to resolve this
issue, and there was a workaround that is documented somewhere in the Julia
manual, not only for this issue but for any issue regarding packages that has
come up since its inception. Somewhat of a cookbook for Pkg failures.
