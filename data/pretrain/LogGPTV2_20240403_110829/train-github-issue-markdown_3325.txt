I understand that the package system is currently undergoing significant development. However, I am encountering difficulties in installing both the `Distributions` and `Gadfly` packages. The `Pkg` manager is identifying dependencies that are not present in the `.julia` directory or anywhere else on my system. Unfortunately, I am unfamiliar with the intricacies of the package system and do not know how to resolve this issue without delving into the code.

It would be extremely helpful if there were a documented workaround available in the Julia manual, rather than having to post on the mailing list for assistance. Ideally, the manual would include a comprehensive guide or "cookbook" for addressing common `Pkg`-related issues, including those that have arisen since the inception of the package system. This would greatly enhance the user experience and reduce the need for frequent support requests.
