ABSTRACT
Many emerging applications drive the needs of device-free
localization (DfL), in which the target can be localized with-
out any device attached. Because of the ubiquitousness of
WiFi infrastructures nowadays, the widely available Received
Signal Strength (RSS) information at the WiFi Access points
are commonly employed for localization purposes. How-
ever, current RSS based DfL systems have one main draw-
back hindering their real-life applications. That is, the RSS
measurements (ﬁngerprints) vary slowly in time even with-
out any change in the environment and frequent updates of
RSS at each location lead to a high human labor cost.
In this paper, we propose an RSS based low cost DfL sys-
tem named TafLoc which is able to accurately localize the
target over a long time scale. To reduce the amount of hu-
man labor cost in updating the RSS ﬁngerprints, TafLoc rep-
resents the RSS ﬁngerprints as a matrix which has several
unique properties. Based on these properties, we propose
a novel ﬁngerprint matrix reconstruction scheme to update
the whole ﬁngerprint database with just a few RSS measure-
ments, thus the labor cost is greatly reduced. Extensive ex-
periments illustrate the effectiveness of TafLoc, outperform-
ing the state-of-the-art RSS based DfL systems.

INTRODUCTION
Beneﬁting from the ubiquitous WiFi infrastructure, RSS
based localization plays a key role in many applications,
such as indoor navigation, location-based service, etc. Most
existing techniques require the target to be equipped with a
communication-capable device, which is detected and local-
ized. However, in many scenarios such as elderly care, the
target is usually reluctant to wear a device or hold a mo-
bile phone. In intruder detection, it’s not even possible for
the target to be attached with such a device. Accordingly,
device-free localization (DfL) systems [2] have attracted in-
creasing attentions. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁngerprint-based sys-
tems employ the RSS measurements when target is present
at different locations to build a ﬁngerprint database. Then
real-time RSS measurements are compared with the ﬁnger-
prints for location estimates. However, to become a practical
system, one key problem still remains unsolved, i.e., the la-
bor and time cost for ﬁngerprint update is high.
It is inevitable to update the ﬁngerprint repeatedly. The
reason is that RSS ﬁngerprints collected initially will expire
over time. In fact, besides the movement of furniture, door
opening and closing, even without any change in the envi-
ronment, the RSS measurements still change slowly in the
scale of days due to temperature and humidity changes. In
our experiments, the RSS values change 2.5 dBm and 6 dBm
respectively after 5 and 45 days. Thus, in order to maintain
the ﬁngerprint-location matching, it’s a necessity to update
the ﬁngerprints whenever there are changes in the envi-

ronment, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming.
To address this issue, we propose TafLoc, the ﬁrst RSS
ﬁngerprint-based DfL system which is able to update the
ﬁngerprint database by only collecting measurements at a
few chosen reference locations. We creatively represent the
database as a two dimensional matrix (Fig. 1) with the fol-
lowing key observations: i) the ﬁngerprint matrix is approxi-
mate low rank and can be roughly reconstructed by the rank-
minimization; ii) the ﬁngerprint matrix can be represented as
a linear combination of the RSS measurements at only a few
reference locations; iii) RSS measurements at neighbor lo-
cations along a particular link are continuous, and measure-
ments at a speciﬁc location from adjacent links are similar.
Based on these key properties, we propose a ﬁngerprint ma-
trix reconstruction scheme to accurately update the ﬁnger-
print database with little human cost.
2. TAFLOC SYSTEM DESIGN
First, we represent the ﬁngerprint database as a two di-
mensional ﬁngerprint matrix, with each column denotes RSS
measurements from different links at a speciﬁc location and
each row denotes RSS measurements at different locations
from a speciﬁc link. We deploy M links on the two sides of
the monitoring area and divide the area into N location grid-
s (M (cid:4) N). Let xij denote the RSS measurement of link i
when target is located in location grid j, where i=1,···, M
and j = 1,···, N. By collecting RSS measurements when
the target is located in each of the N grids, we construct the
ﬁngerprint matrix X = (xij)M×N as shown in Fig. 1. X is
approximate low rank and can be roughly reconstructed by
s.t., B ◦ X = XI, where ˆX is the best ap-
min rank( ˆX),
proximation of X. (B)M×N is a binary matrix with element
B(i, j) = 1 when the RSS measurement xI (ij) of link i is
undistorted by the target at location j.
To improve the reconstruction accuracy, we select n(n(cid:4)
N ) locations with RSS measurements corresponding to the
maximum linearly independent vectors xi in X as reference
locations, and aggregate these measurements as a reference
matrix XR=[x1, ···, xn]. We use the Low Rank Represen-
tation to model the correlation between reference matrix and
ﬁngerprint matrix as X=XR∗Z, Z is the correlation matrix.

F + (cid:6)R(cid:6)2
+(cid:6)LRT − XR ∗ Z(cid:6)2
To further improve the reconstruction accuracy when the
linear correlation loses efﬁcacy due to the changes in en-
vironment, we utilize the third property described earlier.
That is, when a target is present blocking the direct path
of link, the RSS readings has a clear decrease. And along
the path, RSS changes continuously while for the same lo-
cation, the RSS readings from adjacent links are similar. We
term these measurements when a target is present as largely-
distorted RSS and group them as a largely-distorted matrix
XD = (x) N
. The elements in this matrix are continuous
along the row while similar along the column.
Then the reconstruction problem can be expressed as:
F ) + (cid:6)B ◦ (LRT ) − XI(cid:6)2
min λ((cid:6)L(cid:6)2
F +(cid:6)H ∗ XD(cid:6)2
F .
To solve this non-convex problem, we perform SVD on ˆX=
U ΣV T = LRT . G and H characterize the continuity (dif-
ferent locations along the same link) and similarity (same
location from different links) properties, respectively. We
propose an LoLi-IR algorithm which gets L and R in an al-
ternatively iterative manner. By doing so, the ﬁngerprint ma-
trix X can be accurately reconstructed. After we reconstruct
the ﬁngerprint matrix, the real-time RSS measurements are
collected as Y = (yi)M×1. Then the target location can be
estimated by matching Y with X.
3. DEPLOYMENT AND EVALUATION
We implement TafLoc on Atheros AR9331 NIC in an in-
door room with a time scale of 3 months. We deploy 10 links
covering 96 grids with each grid of 0.6m×0.6m (Fig. 2).

Fingerprint reconstruction error. Fig. 3 shows that the
average RSS errors are 2.7 dBm, 3.3 dBm, 3.6 dBm and
4.1 dBm after 3 days, 15 days, 45 days and 3 months, re-
spectively. Since the noise is usually within 1~4 dBm, the
reconstructed ﬁngerprint matrix can serve as reliable ﬁnger-
prints for localization purposes.
Time cost to update the ﬁngerprint. For each grid, 100
continuous RSS are collected one per second. The time cost
to manually update the ﬁngerprints in an area of size 6m×6m
≈2.78 hours. While for TafLoc, only
is at least 100×(6/0.6)2
3600 ≈ 0.28 hours are
10 reference locations with time of 100×10
needed. Fig. 4 shows when the area size becomes bigger,
TafLoc saves more time compared to existing systems.
Comparison of localization accuracy. Fig. 5 shows that
TafLoc performs best when compared with the-state-of-art
RASS [3] and RTI [1] systems. The results of RASS with the
reconstruction scheme show that the median accuracy is also
signiﬁcantly improved which means the proposed method
can be efﬁciently applied on other localization systems.
