While it is possible to equip IoT devices with pre-loaded
keys, user interfaces, or dedicated pairing hardware (e.g.,
NFC), such approaches would overburden manufacturers,
limit interoperability, and slow IoT innovation.
Abstract‚ÄîContext-based pairing solutions increase the usabil-
ity of IoT device pairing by eliminating any human involvement
in the pairing process. This is possible by utilizing on-board
sensors (with same sensing modalities) to capture a common
physical context (e.g., ambient sound via each device‚Äôs micro-
phone). However, in a smart home scenario, it is impractical to
assume that all devices will share a common sensing modality.
For example, a motion detector is only equipped with an
infrared sensor while Amazon Echo only has microphones. In
this paper, we develop a new context-based pairing mechanism
called Perceptio that uses time as the common factor across
differing sensor types. By focusing on the event timing, rather
than the speciÔ¨Åc event sensor data, Perceptio creates event
Ô¨Ångerprints that can be matched across a variety of IoT
devices. We propose Perceptio based on the idea that devices
co-located within a physically secure boundary (e.g., single
family house) can observe more events in common over time,
as opposed to devices outside. Devices make use of the observed
contextual information to provide entropy for Perceptio‚Äôs pairing
protocol. We design and implement Perceptio, and evaluate its
effectiveness as an autonomous secure pairing solution. Our
implementation demonstrates the ability to sufÔ¨Åciently distin-
guish between legitimate devices (placed within the boundary)
and attacker devices (placed outside) by imposing a threshold
on Ô¨Ångerprint similarity. Perceptio demonstrates an average
Ô¨Ångerprint similarity of 94.9% between legitimate devices while
even a hypothetical impossibly well-performing attacker yields
only 68.9% between itself and a valid device.
I. INTRODUCTION
While Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices provide signiÔ¨Åcant
value to smart home operations, the data they create often
contains privacy-sensitive information about user activities
within the home [74], [49], [31], [52], [33]. Securing the
wireless communication among IoT devices is thus a critical
capability for any home IoT deployment. In particular, newly
deployed IoT devices must be able to securely pair with exist-
ing devices through cryptographic key establishment in a way
that protects against man-in-the-middle (MitM) and protocol
manipulation attacks [38], [29], [6], [48], [25], [71], [43].
Such protections unfortunately require users to be involved
in the protocol (e.g., to type in a password), and such human-
in-the-loop solutions are not feasible for many IoT systems.
The Ô¨Årst reason is that the number of IoT devices in a home
is projected to increase from around ten to several hundred
within the next decade [15], [53], increasing the complexity
and burden to the homeowner. Second, most emerging IoT
devices do not have a user interface, so direct password
entry or management
is challenging or impossible [40].
Efforts to reduce or remove human involvement from
the secure pairing process has brought the emergence of
context-based pairing. This allows devices to rely on on-
board sensors to extract entropy from the surrounding en-
vironment, using the principle that co-present devices will
observe similar events. The common sensor measurements
can be translated to common randomness, forming the basis
of a symmetric key agreement protocol [51], [32], [65].
Intuitively, the unpredictability of the activities in the envi-
ronment provides the entropy source and eliminates the need
for a human participant.
While promising Ô¨Årst steps have been taken toward devel-
oping usable and secure IoT device pairing, existing solutions
rely on a common, properly calibrated sensing capability
across all devices (e.g., a microphone or light sensor on each
device). However, in reality, a wide diversity of hardware
capabilities will be present in a smart home, so a usable
pairing protocol must consider this device heterogeneity. We
are particularly inspired by emerging IoT products that have
a small number of embedded sensors (often only one) to opti-
mize cost, power consumption, and form factor (e.g., motion
detector with a single infrared sensor [11] or peel-and-stick
sensors [60]). One of the major challenges in this hetero-
geneous device landscape is that the sensor measurements
from different IoT devices will not be directly comparable.
Aside from different sensing modalities, manufacturers may
use different chipsets or calibration methods, so even sensors
of the same type may measure an event in a different way.
Heterogeneous sensor-based pairing protocols must therefore
rely on a suitable invariant property that can be measured by
devices with a wide variety of conÔ¨Ågurations.
Toward such goals, we need to gain a stronger un-
derstanding of the contextual content of sensory data as
observed from different IoT devices. To do this, we can
gain some insight from analogous human behavior through
the following scenario. Suppose that one person with a
hearing impairment and another with a visual impairment
are both in a room. When the door to the room closes, both
people can observe the event at the same time, but using
different senses; the hearing impaired person can see the
door closing, while the visually impaired person can hear

the door closing. Because of the timing, both people could
share their observations and determine they had witnessed
the same event. This analogy can be further extended to
include events that humans perceive in multiple ways. For
example, we perceive rainfall through hearing, feeling, and
seeing raindrops [8]. By applying this analogy to the IoT
device space, we can similarly leverage timing information
as an invariant property among heterogeneous devices. We
thus develop our approach using a principle we refer to as
‚Äúnumerically different yet contextually similar‚Äù observation
of events, exploiting commonly observed timing information.
In the IoT device regime, we provide a more detailed example
to demonstrate the ability for disparate sensing devices to
measure common events. In this scenario, Bob knocks on
his roommate Dan‚Äôs door to invite him for coffee in the
living room. Dan opens his bedroom door and walks into
the living room, and Bob then makes two cups of coffee.
After enjoying their coffee together, Dan goes back into his
bedroom and closes the door. Suppose now that Bob and Dan
have deployed IoT devices with a geophone and microphone
and that the coffee machine is connected to a power meter.
In this case, the corresponding sensor readings from these
devices capture the events, as depicted in Figure 1. The
different types of sensors are capable of perceiving some
events in common. In particular, the geophone and the mi-
crophone both capture the knocks and door opening/closing
events, while the microphone and power meter both capture
the activity of the coffee machine.
In a more general scenario, sensing devices can detect
relevant events, group them by event type (e.g., using un-
supervised clustering), measure the time interval between
subsequent occurrence of each event type, and map the time
interval measurements to a collection of Ô¨Ångerprints. These
Ô¨Ångerprints can then be incorporated into a veriÔ¨Åcation algo-
rithm to prove co-presence and contribute to the generation
of a shared symmetric key. Different Ô¨Ångerprints can be
incorporated to veriÔ¨Åcation with other devices, depending on
the sensing capabilities of each device.
While our use of inter-event timing removes some useful
signal content, this comes in trade for support of many critical
aspects of practical Ô¨Ångerprint veriÔ¨Åcation that may not be
possible using more descriptive signals. Most importantly,

elimination of numerical signal features introduces a high
degree of tolerance that addresses (1) differing hardware
or sensor calibration methods, (2) signal attenuation due
to variations in proximity between sensors and events, and
(3) measurements from different sensor types. In addition,
the use of time intervals eliminates the need for tight time
synchronization across devices. Moreover, the devices do not
need to recognize the events themselves to measure timing,
but simply (as discussed later) group events by clusters using
unsupervised learning.
Another key insight contributing to our approach is the
idea that IoT devices deployed in a common environment
are intended to collaborate as part of the same smart home
system. Hence, there is an implicit human-driven intent for
the devices to pair with each other as long as they can
determine that they are deployed in the same environment. In
the context of a single-family home, comprising the majority
of housing units in the U.S [46], the building structure and
composition provide a barrier for many types of activities
that would be observed by sensors, including but not limited
to vibration, sound, light, or electrical load. Through the
combination of this physical sensing barrier and the typical
physical security of a single-family home, the secure pairing
problem reduces to verifying co-presence within the home.
Our approach to verifying device co-presence leverages the
fact that devices deployed in the same room of a house will
perceive most of the same events over time, while devices
outside the home will observe different (or signiÔ¨Åcantly
attenuated) events. Random events induced by user activities
(e.g., walking, making coffee) within the home thus provide
the necessary entropy to enable co-presence veriÔ¨Åcation.
Because our approach is based on sensory perception of
events in the surrounding environment, we name our au-
tonomous device pairing technique Perceptio. In Figure 2,
we illustrate the high-level ideas of Perceptio, where multiple
devices within the home observe physical events that cannot
be clearly observed by the outside attacker.Building on this
idea, Perceptio enables IoT devices to effectively Ô¨Ångerprint
their surroundings with no human involvement, achieving
maximum usability. Perceptio uses these Ô¨Ångerprints for sym-

metric key establishment, taking advantage of our Ô¨Åndings
that an outside attacker can neither accurately observe nor
predict events within the home at the temporal granularity
required for veriÔ¨Åcation. From these Ô¨Åndings, our Perceptio
design includes a Key Strengthening Process that builds
conÔ¨Ådence in co-presence veriÔ¨Åcation over time. Starting
with an initial shared key (that may be insecure), Perceptio
augments this key with subsequent Ô¨Ångerprint information
until reaching a desired strength. This process is similar in
spirit to a multi-round security protocol.
To evaluate the design of Perceptio, we perform exper-
iments by equipping a room with a variety of sensors to
represent existing and prevalent commercial IoT products.
Our deployment includes a microphone (smart speakers [7],
[27]), an accelerometer (on-object sensors [69], [23], [56]),
a motion detector [55], [20], a power meter [37], [36], and
a geophone (structure or footstep monitors [73], [58]). In
addition, we deploy corresponding devices as well as higher
quality microphone and accelerometer outside the room to
represent the attacker‚Äôs devices. Human participants perform
a number of typical events in the room, providing the ambient
inputs to the various sensors. As a proof of concept, our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that Ô¨Ångerprints generated
by devices within the room are far more likely to match
(yielding an average of 94.9%), while the highest Ô¨Ångerprints
generated by the attacker‚Äôs devices outside the room have
low similarity to those inside the room (only yielding an
average of 68.9%). To support the proof of concept, we study
existing data sets for activity within smart homes to quantify
the available entropy and the corresponding amount of time
for devices to establish keys with sufÔ¨Åcient conÔ¨Ådence.
Overall, our contributions in this paper are as follow.
‚Ä¢ We develop an autonomous context-based pairing pro-
tocol, named Perceptio, for IoT devices with heteroge-
neous sensing types, using a Ô¨Ångerprint mechanism that
is robust to signal variation across devices, requires no
time synchronization across devices, and needs no prior
training phase.
‚Ä¢ We demonstrate through proof-of-concept implementa-
tion and experimentation that Perceptio can differentiate
between devices inside and outside of the room, effec-
tively protecting against attacking devices located just
outside a user‚Äôs home.
‚Ä¢ We analyze existing data sets to quantify entropy extrac-
tion rates in real-world smart home scenarios, in support
of quantifying the time to build sufÔ¨Åcient conÔ¨Ådence in
device pairing.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We
discuss background and relevant related work in Section II,
and present models and assumptions in Section III. In Sec-
tion IV, we present the entropy extraction and Ô¨Ångerprinting
techniques, and we then present the Perceptio protocol in
Section V. We present our proof-of-concept implementation
of Perceptio in Section VI and subsequent evaluation in
Section VII. We discuss practical deployment considerations
and limitations in Sections VIII and IX, respectively. We then
conclude our work in Section X.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
We present background information on sensors equipped
by smart home devices, and related work on secure pairing.
Commercial Smart Home Sensors. We witness many
smart home IoT devices commercially available today. Each
of these devices is equipped with a small number of on-board
sensors (often one), with a speciÔ¨Åc sensing modality ‚Äì e.g.,
smart speakers equipped with microphones and motion detec-
tors equipped with PIR sensors. We present a more detailed
overview of smart home IoT devices and their corresponding
sensor types in Appendix A. We present Perceptio to enable
these smart home devices of heterogeneous sensor modalities
to prove that they are co-located within a physical boundary
by experiencing similar events.
Human-in-the-Loop-based Pairing. We Ô¨Årst highlight
some of the traditional secure pairing protocols using human-
in-the-loop solutions. One of the work in this category
is Seeing-is-Believing, which authenticates other device‚Äôs
public key by taking a picture of a 2D bar code which
encodes the hash of the public key of the other device [47].
Furthermore, many industry standards such as Bluetooth
Secure Simple Pairing [29] and Wi-Fi Protected Setup [6]
requires humans to enter passwords on the devices intended
for pairing. These solutions, however, are not applicable in
smart home environments due to usability concerns.
Context-based Pairing. Researchers also explore context-
based pairing protocols to capture commonly observed con-
text for pairing leveraging on-board sensors without requiring
human involvement. Miettinen et al. propose recurring au-
thentication when pairing devices at home by leveraging am-
bient sound or light [51]. Devices co-located at one household
would experience similar context as opposed to devices in a
neighbor‚Äôs house. Schurmann et al. propose a similar idea,
but leverage short audio as contextual information for secure
pairing [65]. Rostami et al. propose a key agreement scheme
between an implanted heart with its remote programmer [63].
They establish a shared key by extracting entropy bits from
measuring the patients heart beat. Han et al. propose recurring
authentication across trucks driving on a highway by sensing
context from the road bumpiness using accelerometer [32].
While these approaches are promising Ô¨Årst steps in the
context-based pairing schemes, they all focus on leveraging
identical sensor pairs across devices such as microphones,
accelerometers, and other sensors using direct signal analysis.
Unlike these homogeneous context-based pairing schemes,
Perceptio addresses a difÔ¨Åcult but interesting question of how
to enable differing (i.e., heterogeneous) sensor modalities to
capture the same contextual information.
III. MODELS AND ASSUMPTIONS
We now present our threat model describing the goals
and capabilities of the attacker. Subsequently, we present the
assumptions and constraints of Perceptio.
A. Threat Model
The goal of the attacker is to leak private information
of home occupants by eavesdropping on the communication

between IoT devices. In order to achieve this goal,
attacker may launch (1) Shamming attack or (2) Man-in-the-
Middle attack.
