User: If I rename the python interpreter from C:\Python27\python.exe to C:\Python27\python27.exe and run it, it will not complain.
But if I now try to run C:\Python27\Scripts\ipython.exe, it will fail to start because now the python interpreter has a different filename.
My question is: how do I configure IPython (ms windows) to start up a python interpreter which has a different filename than python.exe?
Assistant: Found a solution:
python27.exe c:\Python27\Scripts\ipython-script.py
