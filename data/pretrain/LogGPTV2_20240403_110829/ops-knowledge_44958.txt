I have written a small Python program that uses the `curses` library to display output on the screen. The program seems to work well for my simple use case, and I run it from the command line.

However, I am encountering an issue where the terminal does not display content correctly after I terminate the Python `curses` program. For example, the `ls -al` command displays properly before running my `curses` program, but it does not display correctly after I kill the program.

What can I do to ensure that my terminal's display returns to its normal state after I terminate my Python `curses` program?

**Solution:**
Typically, you can reset your terminal settings to their default values by using the `reset` command. This should restore the terminal to its proper state.
