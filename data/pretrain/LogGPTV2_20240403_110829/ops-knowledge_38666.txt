Assistant: To build a high-availability cloud computing platform to meet large-scale business needs, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. Distributed architecture: using a distributed architecture can distribute different computing resources, storage resources, and network resources to different nodes In addition, it increases the scalability and fault tolerance of the system. At the same time, adopting a distributed architecture can reduce the risk of a single point of failure and improve system availability. 2. Load balancing: Introduce load balancing technology to distribute and schedule business requests to ensure uniform load distribution of the system and avoid system failure caused by overload of a single node. 3. Automated deployment: Using automated deployment technology, the system can be quickly deployed and updated to quickly respond to business needs. At the same time, automated deployment can also reduce human errors and improve system stability. 4. Data backup and recovery: regular backup of system data to ensure data integrity and availability. In the event of system failure or data loss, data can be quickly restored to ensure business continuity. 5. Security protection: introduce a security protection mechanism for the cloud computing platform, including identity authentication, access authorization, data encryption, etc., to protect the security and stability of the system. 6. Monitoring and operation and maintenance: Introduce monitoring and operation and maintenance technology to monitor and maintain the system in real time, discover and deal with system abnormalities in time, and ensure the stable operation of the system. The above are several aspects that need to be considered in building a high-availability cloud computing platform. Comprehensive consideration of these aspects can better cope with large-scale business needs.
