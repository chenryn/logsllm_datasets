This observation motivated the deﬁnition of the Type I(cid:48) attack model in
this paper, and the lemmas relating Type I and Type II security with this new
variant. The limited adaptive behaviour of Type I(cid:48) attackers permits applying
Coron’s technique directly in the certiﬁcateless scenario. As an example of why
this is a relevant contribution, we refer to the certiﬁcateless signature proposed
in [19], which is claimed to be secure against Type I attackers. The proof which
is presented for this scheme is ﬂawed, and actually establishes security against
more limited Type I(cid:48) adversaries.
Randomness Reuse: The proposed signcryption scheme is structured inter-
nally as an Encrypt-then-Sign construction using algorithms from [8] and [19]
and sharing randomness between the two schemes. The encryption algorithm
can be shown to be IND-CPA secure, whereas the signature algorithm is sUF-
CMA secure. The expected security of our construction, which follows from the
work of An et al. [2], is therefore IND-CCA security against outsider adversaries
and full insider sUF-CMA security. It is interesting to note, however, that our
scheme presents full insider security for conﬁdentiality. This is due to the reuse of
randomness between the encryption and signature components which intuitively
prevents an insider adversary from being able to forge a valid signcryption from
another one for which it does not know the implicit randomness.
Randomness reuse also provides the usual eﬃciency gains. We are able to
save a few exponentiations and one ciphertext element through this technique.
Eﬃciency beneﬁts also justify our choice of the GBDH problem in the security
reduction. The gap oracle allows us to construct a consistent simulation without
resorting to a generic transformation akin to that in [15] which would add an
extra ciphertext element to the scheme and a costly consistency check in de-
signcryption. As a ﬁnal note on the eﬃciency of the scheme, we note that we
could have based our construction on the certiﬁcateless encryption scheme in
[1]. This would provide a small computational gain if one considered public key
20
validity check could be pre-computed. However, this would imply reducing the
scheme’s security to the less standard variant of the GBDH problem used in [1].
Self-Signcryption: We note that, although our security models disallow attacks
targeting signcryptions where the sender and receiver identities are the same, it
is possible to modify our proof of security to account for this type of attacks.
However, one would need less standard versions of the underlying hard problems
to construct the security reduction. It is arguable whether this sort of security
property is relevant in practice, although speciﬁc applications such as protecting
one’s ﬁles or previously sent encrypted e-mails may be used to justify it.
Malicious KGCs: Malicious KGC attacks have not been considered in this
paper. However, the proposed scheme withstands the restricted attacks described
in [3], which consist of allowing a malicious KGC to generate the (Msk, params)
pair itself as long as it provides these to the challenger. We believe that a more
realistic and stronger malicious KGC security model would only require that the
adversary outputs the public parameters. We leave it as an open problem to ﬁnd
a certiﬁcateless signcryption scheme which can be proven secure in this stronger
security model.

Appendix A – Proof of Lemma 1
Proof. Let A be an insider Type I adversary against the CLSC scheme. We
construct an algorithm B which has non-negligible advantage against the insider
Type I(cid:48) or the insider Type II security game as follows. Algorithm B receives
the parameters from the Type I(cid:48) and Type II security games. It ﬂips a coin c
as to guess if A will be replacing the public key for ID∗
R (case c = 0) or extract
the partial private key for it (case c = 1). If c = 0 then B passes the parameters
from the Type I(cid:48) game to A and outputs a random bit in the Type II game,
22
otherwise it passes the parameters from Type II game and returns a random bit
in Type I(cid:48) game. Let us deﬁne the following two events:
– R: the event that A chooses to replace the public key of ID∗
– E: the event that A chooses to extract the partial private key of ID∗
R in the ﬁrst
stage.
R at some
point.
S and ID∗
We now describe how algorithm B answers various queries made by A in each
case.
Case c = 0: Algorithm B answers the request public key, replace public key,
partial private key extraction and decryption oracles using his equivalent oracles.
When A outputs two identities ID∗
R and two messages, algorithm B
also returns these to its own challenge oracle. The simulation fails if A decides
to extract the partial private key of ID∗
R and not replace its public key (event
¬R∧ E). In this case B outputs a random bit and terminates. The second stage
of the game is simulated as in the ﬁrst case. Note that the simulation in the
second stage fails if A ever decides to ask for the partial private key of ID∗
R.
This query is allowed if A did not replace the public key of ID∗
R in the ﬁrst stage
(event ¬R ∧ E). When A outputs a bit b(cid:48), algorithm B also outputs this bit as
his own guess.
Case c = 1: Algorithm B answers the request public key, replace public key,
partial private key extraction and decryption oracles using his equivalent oracles.
When A outputs two identities ID∗
R and two messages, algorithm B also
returns these to its own challenge oracle. The simulation fails if A decided to
replace the public key of ID∗
R and not extract its partial private key (event
R∧¬E). In this case B outputs a random bit and terminates. The second stage
of the game is simulated as in the ﬁrst case. Note that the simulation in the
second stage is perfect. When A outputs a bit b(cid:48), algorithm B also outputs this
bit as his own guess.
We now analyse the probably that algorithm B returns the correct answer in one
of the games it plays. Let bI(cid:48) and bII be the hidden bits in the Type I(cid:48) and Type
II games respectively. Let also b1 and b2 denote the bits B outputs. Note that if
the simulation does terminate unexpectedly, c remains hidden from adversary’s
view. Note also that A is not allowed to provoke the event R ∧ E. We have:
2 Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48)] = Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48)|c = 0] + Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48)|c = 1] = Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48)|c = 0] +
And similarly:

And hence:

Now:
Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48)|c = 0] = Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48) ∧ E1|c = 0] + Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48) ∧ E2|c = 0] +
+ Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48) ∧ E3|c = 0]
= Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48) ∧ E1|c = 0] + 1/2 + Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48) ∧ E3|c = 0],
where E1 := R ∧ ¬E, E2 := ¬R ∧ E and E3 := ¬R ∧ ¬E. Similarly:
Pr[b2 = bII|c = 1] = 1/2 + Pr[b2 = bII ∧ E2|c = 1] + Pr[b2 = bII ∧ E3|c = 1].
Now:
Pr[b(cid:48) = bI|c = 0] = Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48) ∧ E1|c = 0] + Pr[b(cid:48) = bI(cid:48) ∧ E2|c = 0] +
+ Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48) ∧ E3|c = 0].
And similarly:
Pr[b(cid:48) = bI|c = 1] = Pr[b(cid:48) = bII ∧ E1|c = 1] + Pr[b2 = bII ∧ E2|c = 1] +
+ Pr[b2 = bII ∧ E3|c = 1].
Therefore adding up:
2 Pr[b(cid:48) = bI] = Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48)|c = 0] − 1
2
+ Pr[b2 = bII|c = 1] − 1
2
+ Pr[b(cid:48) = bI(cid:48) ∧ E2|c = 0] +
+ Pr[b(cid:48) = bII ∧ E1|c = 1].
Subtracting 1 from both sides, taking absolute signs and using the deﬁnitions of
advantage we get:

2
| +
|.
It remains to bound the quantity in absolute signs above. Since c is independent
of A’s view until the event E1 or E2 occurs in each case, we have:
Pr[b(cid:48) = bI ∧ E2|c = 0] = Pr[b(cid:48) = bII ∧ E2|c = 1] = Pr[b2 = bII ∧ E2|c = 1]
Pr[b(cid:48) = bI ∧ E1|c = 1] = Pr[b(cid:48) = bI(cid:48) ∧ E1|c = 0] = Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48) ∧ E1|c = 0]
≤ Pr[b2 = bII|c = 1],
≤ Pr[b1 = bI(cid:48)|c = 0].
