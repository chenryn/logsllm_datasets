publish their apps. These models could be classified into three
categories. The first one is “The Starting App and Exclusive
App Free Promotion”, a common mechanism across markets
which gives stores publication exclusivity for a period of time
in exchange for actively taking measures to promote the app,
typically during 24 hours. The second category is “High Qual-
ity App Free Promotion”. Some markets have a qualification
of high-quality apps. Apps that meet the criteria to obtain such
a qualification could request the markets to promote them for
free. The third category is “Editors’ Choice”, in which the
store recommends apps based on personal opinions.
(4) Auditing process: All app markets but HiApk and PC Online
indicate that apps are published after an inspection and vet-
ting process. Moreover, eight markets (Google Play, Tencent,
OPPO, Xiaomi, Meizu, Huawei, Anzhi and AppChina) claim to
incorporate human inspections attempting to complement the
automated auditing process. The general approach is to use au-
tomated security analysis tools first to identify possible threats3,
and then manually check the most suspicious submissions. For
example, a majority of the top apps in the Huawei market are
labeled with a sign indicating that they went through man-
ual inspection before being made publicly available, and it is
reported that Huawei has a large human inspection team [1].
Excluding HiApk and PC Online, Chinese alternative app stores
also explicitly check and report security issues on the apps (e.g.,
malware and aggressive adware). The inspection time varies
across markets, from several hours (Google Play) to roughly 5
days (Huawei market). 360 market requires all the developers
3Some web companies have released their own security analysis tools for Android
apps, e.g., 360 Mobile Security [7] and Baidu PhoneGuard [68, 69].
