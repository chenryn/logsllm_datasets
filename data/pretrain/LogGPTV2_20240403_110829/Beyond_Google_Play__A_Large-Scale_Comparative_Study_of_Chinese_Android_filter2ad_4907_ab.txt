### App Market Analysis and Promotion Strategies

**App Distribution Channels:**
- **Market Type:** 
  - **Official Markets:** Google Play, Tencent Myapp, Baidu Market, 360 Market, Huawei Market, OPPO Market, Xiaomi Market, Meizu Market
  - **Vendor Markets:** HW Vendor (Huawei, OPPO, Xiaomi, Meizu, Lenovo)
  - **Specialized Markets:** 25PP, Wandoujia, HiApk, AnZhi, LIQU, PC Online, Sougou, App China

**Promotion Models:**
1. **The Starting App and Exclusive App Free Promotion:**
   - This model is common across various markets. It provides stores with exclusive publication rights for a specified period, typically 24 hours, in exchange for active promotion of the app.

2. **High-Quality App Free Promotion:**
   - Some markets have a qualification process for high-quality apps. Apps that meet the criteria can request free promotion from the market.

3. **Editors’ Choice:**
   - In this category, the store recommends apps based on personal opinions and editorial discretion.

**Auditing Process:**
- All app markets, except HiApk and PC Online, conduct an inspection and vetting process before publishing apps.
- Eight markets (Google Play, Tencent, OPPO, Xiaomi, Meizu, Huawei, Anzhi, and AppChina) incorporate human inspections to complement automated auditing.
- The general approach involves using automated security analysis tools to identify potential threats, followed by manual checks for suspicious submissions.
- For example, Huawei labels many top apps with a sign indicating they have undergone manual inspection. Huawei also has a large human inspection team [1].
- Chinese alternative app stores explicitly check and report security issues such as malware and aggressive adware.
- Inspection times vary from several hours (Google Play) to approximately 5 days (Huawei Market).
- 360 Market requires developers to use their packaging tool, 360 Jiagubao [34], to obfuscate apps before submission.

**App Quality Ratings:**
- Only Tencent Myapp and 360 Market explicitly rate the quality of published apps based on metrics such as downloads, user comments, developer level, and other factors.
- High-quality apps may receive additional benefits and promotions.
