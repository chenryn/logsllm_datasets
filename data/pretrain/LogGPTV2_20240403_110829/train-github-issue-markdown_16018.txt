# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I want to extend my keyboard layout to allow entering specific Unicode
characters that are not accessible via the plain keyboard layout.
Specifically, as a German speaker who spends 99% of the time coding and 1%
writing short emails or chat notices in German, I want to extend a US layout
to allow easy access to German umlauts without having to change the layout:
  * AltGr+A -> "ä"
  * AltGr+U -> "ü"
  * AltGr+s -> "ß"  
and so on.
Keyboard manager only allows remapping keys to other keys or shortcuts to
other existing shortcuts. What is missing is a way to remap shortcuts to
characters that are not yet accessible via the layout.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
"Remap shortcuts" could allow multiple alternative targets. One of them could
allow entering (or pasting) an arbitrary unicode string.
