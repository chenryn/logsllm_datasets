This is my playbook.

debug:  
msg: "sequence is {{ item }}"  
with_sequence: start=1 end=5
I'm expecting the order 1,2,3,4,5 in order , but this prints the item in
random fashion.
ok: [web01] => (item=3) => {  
"item": "3",  
"msg": "sequence is 3"  
}  
ok: [web01] => (item=2) => {  
"item": "2",  
"msg": "sequence is 2"  
}  
ok: [web01] => (item=1) => {  
"item": "1",  
"msg": "sequence is 1"  
}  
ok: [web01] => (item=5) => {  
"item": "5",  
"msg": "sequence is 5"  
}  
ok: [web01] => (item=4) => {  
"item": "4",  
"msg": "sequence is 4"  
}
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
