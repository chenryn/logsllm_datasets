Subject: Assistance Needed with Glide Caching Issue

Dear Development Team,

I am currently using the Glide library to display product images within my application, particularly on the product detail page. Here is a snippet of the code I use for this purpose:

```java
Glide.with(context)
     .load(url)
     .thumbnail(Glide.with(context)
                    .load(placeholderResId)
                    .apply(new RequestOptions().centerCrop()))
     .into(productImageView);
```

While the caching mechanism provided by Glide is excellent for reducing bandwidth usage, I have encountered an issue that requires your expertise.

### Problem Description:
- **Scenario:**
  - The product detail page is displayed, including a product image.
  - The user deletes the product image.
  - The user reopens the product detail page.
- **Expected Behavior:**
  - The deleted product image should not be visible; instead, a placeholder should be shown.
- **Current Behavior:**
  - The product image is loaded from the cache and displayed, which is not the desired outcome.

### Attempted Solutions:
1. **Feature Request:**
   - I would like to have the ability to delete a single image from the cache. However, I discovered that this feature is not available in Glide.
   
2. **Workaround:**
   - I found [this issue #552](https://github.com/bumptech/glide/issues/552) and decided to implement the first suggested solution, despite its drawbacks (deleting product images is a rare occurrence).
   - I tried clearing both the disk and memory caches using the following code:
     ```java
     Glide.get(getApplicationContext()).clearDiskCache();
     Glide.get(getApplicationContext()).clearMemory();
     ```
   - This approach, however, resulted in the following error when attempting to reopen the product detail page:
     ```java
     java.lang.IllegalStateException: cache is closed

         at com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.executor.GlideExecutor$DefaultThreadFactory$1.run(GlideExecutor.java:413)
     ```

### Questions:
- How can I "reinitialize" Glide after clearing the cache to avoid the `cache is closed` error?
- Are there any alternative approaches to handle this scenario more effectively?

### Additional Information:
- **Glide Version:** 4.3.1
- **Integration Libraries:** OkHttp3
- **Device/Android Version:** Nexus 5X
- **Glide Load Line:**
  ```java
  Glide.with(context).load(url)...
  ```
- **Layout XML:**
  ```xml
  <FrameLayout xmlns:android="...">
  ```

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Ben
