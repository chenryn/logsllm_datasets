corresponding PF A and PD achieved by the optimum threshold
are PF A = 0.0936 and PD = 0.9064. The defense scenario
slightly outperforms the normal scenario in terms of reducing
PF A and increasing PD with the optimum threshold, leading
to PF A = 0.0635 and PD = 0.9365.
The forgery scenario has the worst performance. With the
optimum threshold, PF A = 0.4045 and PD = 0.5935. Note
that, in our experiment, a link signature is either from the
transmitter or from the attacker, and thus the probability that
a blind guess hits the true source of this link signature is 0.5.
The false alarm rate PF A and detection rate PD in the forgery
scenario are just slightly better than a blind guess.
Figure 13 shows the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves for the normal, forgery, and defense scenarios,
in
which the PF A and PD are the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.
The curve representing the defense scenario is on the top-
left corner of the ﬁgure, indicating good performance of the
time-synched link signature.
3) Frame Time Delay: The proposed time-synched link
signature uses estimated frame traverse to ﬁlter out frames
forwarded by the attacker. We measure the time delay of
frames from the transmitter and the attacker, respectively, to
examine this approach. In our experiment, the frame length
is 190 bits and the transmission rate is set to 500Kbps. The
transmitter sends 130 frames, and the attacker forwards all of
them. Thus, the receiver receives 260 frames in total.
Figure 14 shows that the time delays of frames forwarded
by the attacker signiﬁcantly exceed those of the frames directly
by the transmitter. Our further analysis indicates that the ratio
of attacker’s delay to the transmitter’s delay ranges between
2.2 and 2.6, indicating that the forwarding by the attacker
approximately doubles the time delay.
We would like to caution the reader that due to the limitation
of USRP2, our implementation does not perform physical layer
timestamping. Thus, the time delay measured in our experi-
ments include the processing time on the PC and the USRP2
boards. In a real deployment, physical layer timestamping is
necessary to increase the precision of time synchronization
and time measurement.
Fig. 12. False alarm rate PF A and detection rate PD.
In the defense scenario, as indicated in Figure 9, the use
of time-synched link signature increases da,H of forged link
signatures. In particular, the mean value of da,H under defense
and forgery scenarios are 0.7368 and 0.4648, respectively. The
histogram of da,H in the defense scenario (i.e., the bottom
graph in Figure 11) shows that the link difference computed
from a majority of forged signatures is smaller than 0.6. Thus,
the receiver can again distinguish between the transmitter and
the attacker with low error rate.
2) Detection and False Alarm Rates: As we mentioned
earlier, a history of N transmitter’s link signatures is measured
and stored at the receiver, and the receiver computes the link
difference d between a newly measured link signature and
history link signatures. In our experiment, we follow the same
detection rule as used in [5]. Speciﬁcally, if d is smaller
than a certain threshold r, the receiver concludes that this
link signature is from the transmitter. Otherwise, the receiver
assumes that it is from the attacker.
Let NF A denote the number of link signatures that are
actually from the transmitter but incorrectly identiﬁed as from
the attacker, and ND denote the number of link signatures that
are from the attacker and detected by the receiver. The false
alarm rate PF A is calculated as the ratio of NF A to the total
number of the transmitter’s link signatures, and the detection
rate PD is computed as the ratio of ND to the total number
of the attacker’s link signatures.
Figure 12 shows PF A and PD as a function of
the
threshold r. A large threshold can reduce false alarm rate
PF A, whereas a small threshold can increase detection rate.
Therefore, an optimum threshold that can both minimize false
alarm rate and maximize detection rate is usually desired

least
In our previous works [35] and [36], we only addressed the
simple mimicry attack scenario, where both the receiver and
the attacker have only one antenna. In this paper, we discussed
the general case when both the receiver and the attacker have
multiple antennas, and discovered that the mimicry attack
is still feasible in MIMO systems, as long as the attacker
can utilize at
the same number of antennas as the
receiver. We also extended mimicry attacks to the multiple tone
probing based link signature and showed that mimicry attacks
can make all existing link signature schemes vulnerable.
Furthermore, in [36], we only compared the link differences
for the attacker and the transmitter in the normal, forgery
and defense scenarios, respectively. In this paper, we further
explored how to set an appropriate threshold that enables the
proposed time-synched link signature scheme to achieve a high
detection rate while keeping a low false alarm rate in the
three scenarios.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we identiﬁed the mimicry attack against the
existing wireless link signature schemes. We then extended
the mimicry attack in MIMO systems and concluded that the
attacker utilizing at least the same number of antennas as the
receiver’s antennas can successfully launch the mimicry attack.
To defend against the mimicry attack, we proposed the novel
time-synched link signature construction by integrating crypto-
graphic protection and time factor into wireless physical layer
features. We also performed an extensive set of experiments
to demonstrate both the feasibility of mimicry attacks and the
effectiveness of time-synched link signature.

VII. RELATED WORK
A. Wireless Transmitter Authentication
Existing techniques using non-cryptographic approaches
to authenticate wireless transmitters can be classiﬁed into
three categories [2]: software ﬁngerprinting (e.g., [28]–[30]),
location distinction (e.g.,
[9]), and radiometric
identiﬁcation (e.g., [2], [31]).
[5],
[6],
In software ﬁngerprinting approaches, discrepancies in soft-
ware conﬁguration are used as ﬁngerprints to distinguish
between wireless nodes [2]. For example, Franklin et al. [28]
proposed to use the implementation dependent differ-
ences among device drivers
to identify 802.11 nodes.
Kohno et al. [30] proposed to use clock skews in TCP and
ICMP timestamps to ﬁngerprint networked devices.
In location distinction based authentication, a signal
is
authenticated by verifying whether it originates from the
expected location of the transmitter. RSS (e.g., [32]) and
link signatures have been used to enable such location dis-
tinction [5]. The RSS based methods directly estimate the
location of a signal origin using the RSS values. However, such
methods can be defeated with an array antenna, which can
fake arbitrary source locations [5]. The link signature based
approaches authenticate the channel characteristics between
the transmitter and the receiver [5], [6], [9]. In this paper,
we showed that all these link signature scheme are vulnerable
to mimicry attacks. Our newly proposed time-synched link
signature is developed to ﬁll this gap.
In radiometric identiﬁcation approaches,
the distinctive
physical layer characteristics exhibited by wireless devices
are utilized to distinguish between them. Transient based
techniques (e.g., [31]) identify a wireless device by look-
ing at the unique features “during the transient phase when
the radio is turned on” [33]. Modulation based techniques
(e.g.,
individual
wireless frames in the modulation domain to identify the
device.
[2]) measure differentiating artifacts of
B. Attacks on Radiometric Identiﬁcation
Recently, it was demonstrated in [33] and [34] that radio-
metric identiﬁcation techniques were vulnerable to imperson-
ation attacks. The results in [33] revealed that both transient
and modulation based techniques are vulnerable to imperson-
ation attacks, though transient-based techniques are harder to
reproduce. Edman and Yener [34] showed that an attacker can
