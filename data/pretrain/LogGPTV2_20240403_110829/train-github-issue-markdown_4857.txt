**System information**
  * Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
  * OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS 10.14.4
  * TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary from pip/PyPi
  * TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.13.1
  * Python version: 3.7
  * CUDA/cuDNN version: CPU only
  * GPU model and memory: MacPro integrated
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script  
You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with  
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
**Describe the current behavior**  
I have previously running code that explodes on import prior to any runtime
execution. Reports the error above.
**Describe the expected behavior**  
This library needs to run and not choke on its own imports.
**Code to reproduce the issue**  
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to
generate the problem.
**Other info / logs**  
Using TensorFlow backend.
