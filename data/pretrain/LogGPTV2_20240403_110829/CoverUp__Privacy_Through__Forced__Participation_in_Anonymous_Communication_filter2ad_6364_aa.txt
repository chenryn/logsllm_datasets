## Abstract

The privacy guarantees of anonymous communication networks (ACNs) are directly proportional to the number of active participants. Consequently, an ACN can only achieve strong privacy if it attracts a large user base. Conversely, weak privacy guarantees make an ACN unattractive, leading to a low number of users.

In this work, we introduce CoverUp, a system that "forces" visitors of high-traffic websites to become involuntary participants in an ACN. CoverUp utilizes basic browser functionality to execute server-served JavaScript code and open remote connections, thereby connecting all website visitors to the ACN. We build two applications on top of CoverUp: an anonymous feed and a chat. Both applications demonstrate practical performance and strong privacy guarantees. Against a network-level attacker, CoverUp makes voluntary and involuntary participants indistinguishable, providing an anonymity set that includes all website visitors. This not only ensures anonymity but also allows voluntary participants to hide their intent to use the ACN. Given the ethical and legal concerns raised by forced participation, we discuss these issues and propose ways to address them.

## 1. Introduction

Many privacy-enhancing technologies, particularly ACNs, suffer from insufficient user participation. Without a significant number of participants, anonymity networks are vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks or experience performance degradation in terms of throughput and latency. Tor, with approximately 1.5 million users, is the most widely used ACN, but it is known to be susceptible to various passive and active traffic pattern attacks. Other ACNs, while more secure against global attackers, have struggled to attract a large user base, resulting in a vicious cycle where low participation leads to weak anonymity, which in turn deters potential users.

In this work, we address these challenges through "forced" user participation. By compelling users to participate in an ACN, we can achieve strong anonymity via a large anonymity set, helping to bootstrap the ACN and even hide the intention of voluntary participants.

We design a system called CoverUp, which leverages the basic functionality of browsers to execute JavaScript code served by visited websites. CoverUp is intended for use on popular sites like university or news portals, which serve as entry points and trigger participation in the ACN. Visitors to these sites become involuntary participants, generating cover traffic in which voluntary participants can hide their activities. In addition to the JavaScript code, CoverUp includes a browser extension for voluntary participants.

We implement CoverUp in two representative applications: an anonymous feed and a chat. Our evaluations show that both applications are practical, provide strong user anonymity, and enable users to plausibly deny their active use of CoverUp. We assume a strong adversary who can fully observe network traffic and control the entry server. The feed can tolerate a malicious CoverUp server, while the chat requires a trusted CoverUp server.

In our prototype, the mix servers are implemented as Java servlets on an Apache Tomcat web server. The CoverUp external application and browser extension are implemented using Java and the Mozilla Firefox web extension API, respectively. After a randomized delay to mask initial leakage, our prototype achieves a downlink and uplink rate of 20 Kbit/s with a latency of 36.55 seconds within one site. We evaluate the privacy guarantees provided by CoverUp by analyzing differences in network delays between voluntary and involuntary users. Our results show that an attacker can distinguish between the two groups with 56.3% accuracy over a year of observations, assuming a realistic usage pattern.

### Ethical and Legal Concerns

"Forcing" participation may seem intrusive, but it can be implemented using commonly-used browser functionality, and users can be informed and/or asked for explicit consent. Involuntary allocation of resources is not uncommon for web visitors, as it already occurs with advertisements and quality-of-service scripts like Google Analytics. The computational overhead of CoverUp is negligible, and the traffic overhead for a visitor is around 7.5 MB per day, which is minimal compared to video streaming services. Our work has received formal approval from our institute's ethics commission. We discuss the legal implications for involuntary participants and the websites acting as entry servers, elaborating on the liability across different jurisdictions. We also argue that, with increasing demand for privacy, websites could enhance their reputation by supporting such a service, attracting privacy-conscious visitors.

### Contributions

- **Novel Concept:** We introduce the concept of privacy through "forced" participation, where popular services help increase user participation in ACNs, creating a larger anonymity set.
- **System Design:** We design CoverUp, a web-based system that generates cover traffic for anonymity networks.
- **Applications:** We instantiate CoverUp in a feed and chat application, demonstrating practical performance and strong privacy guarantees.
- **Privacy Evaluation:** We evaluate the privacy of CoverUp, experimentally assessing timing leakage on Windows for both voluntary and involuntary participants.
- **Legal and Ethical Discussion:** We discuss the legal and ethical aspects of CoverUp, including the liability of entry servers and the implications for involuntary participants.

## 2. Problem Description

Anonymous communication is a key component of many privacy-enhancing systems. The anonymity provided by an ACN is limited by the number of participants. In this work, we explore the following problem:

- **Can an ACN be strengthened by "forced" participation?**
- **What privacy guarantees and performance can such an ACN provide?**

Increased participation enhances privacy, but there are challenges. First, involuntary participants must be included without damaging their systems. Second, involuntary participants should not be distinguishable from voluntary participants. If an attacker can differentiate between the two, increased involuntary participation will not improve privacy. However, if involuntary participants appear the same as voluntary ones, the system will have a larger anonymity set and provide plausible deniability for voluntary participants.

## 3. CoverUp

To address these challenges, we developed CoverUp, a prototype system that leverages common JavaScript functionality in browsers to cause visitors of a cooperating website to generate cover traffic for CoverUp users. The cooperating website, called the entry server, includes a request to a dedicated CoverUp server. The CoverUp server responds with a JavaScript code snippet, which triggers the visitors' browsers to produce constant-rate cover traffic to a mix server. The mix server then sends the feed to all parties. Voluntary participants extract the content via an external application, while involuntary participants only generate cover traffic.

### 3.1. Uni-directional Channel (Feed)

This setup creates a uni-directional channel, allowing the mix server to send information to voluntary participants. The browser stores the data in the `localStorage`, from which the external application retrieves the content. This channel enables participants to anonymously download feeds, assuming no trust in the servers they connect to.

### 3.2. Bi-directional Channel (Chat)

By extending this design, we can create a bi-directional channel to support anonymous chat. The mix server ensures that participants' communications are properly mixed, preventing traffic correlation attacks. This setup supports anonymous chat with minimal trust assumptions on the CoverUp and mix servers.

## 5. Privacy Notion

We define a privacy notion that captures the indistinguishability of involuntary and voluntary participants and relate it to existing anonymity notions in the literature.

## 6. Privacy Analysis

We analyze the privacy of CoverUp and show that the direct privacy leakage depends on its timing leakage. We experimentally evaluate this timing leakage and interpret the privacy results.

## 7. Experimental Evaluation

We experimentally evaluate the timing leakage of CoverUp on Windows for both voluntary and involuntary participants, presenting the results in Figures 6 and 7.
