**Current behavior**  
There seems to be no way to focus a FormControl.
**Expected behavior**  
FormControl provides a _.focus()_ instance method, or access to the native
HTML element.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
To give input focus to a control when it is invalid, as in the following
example:
    if (!this.form.valid) {
      let invalid = Object.keys(this.form.controls).map(key => this.form.controls[key]).filter(ctl => ctl.invalid);
      if (invalid.length > 0) {
        // Give input focus to invalid[0]... how?
      }
      return false;
    }
