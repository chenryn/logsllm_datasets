# Brief Summary
Forgive me if this is already trivially possible, but the docs suggest it
isn't.
For the simplest case, it would be nice to have an option to not allow tasks
to overlap per worker i.e. where by _simplest case_ I mean a single instance
with one worker running _Periodic Tasks_ for example (non-distributed)
# Design
## Architectural Considerations
Current behavior would remain default
## Proposed Behavior
Each worker checks if the task is already running on itself. Exponential
backoff comes free?
## Proposed UI/UX
  * Checkbox on django-celery-beat admin maybe?
## Diagrams
N/A
## Alternatives
Implement locking as per
http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/tutorials/task-cookbook.html#ensuring-
a-task-is-only-executed-one-at-a-time, a heavy burden compared to the
proposal.
