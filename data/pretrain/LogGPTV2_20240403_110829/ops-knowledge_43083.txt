I am working with Python and its companion library, Scapy, and I have encountered a situation that I am unsure whether it is a normal behavior of the ARP protocol or indicative of another issue.

Here is the scenario:
1. A virtual machine (VM 1) sends an "ARP Request" to another virtual machine (VM 2) with a spoofed source MAC address (generated using Scapy).
2. VM 2 receives this "ARP Request" with the spoofed source MAC address and responds with an "ARP Reply." The unexpected part is that VM 1 receives this "ARP Reply."

**Additional Notes:**
- I have confirmed with Wireshark that the first packet (ARP Request) reaches VM 2 with the source MAC address field correctly spoofed.
- Promiscuous mode is disabled on the network interfaces, meaning that the VMs should only receive packets that are specifically destined for their interfaces.

### Questions:
a) Is this the expected behavior of the ARP protocol?
b) Given that VM 1 has a different, real MAC address configured on its interface, how does the response packet sent from VM 2, which has a spoofed MAC address in the destination field (which does not exist on the network), reach VM 1? How is it processed by VM 1 as a valid "ARP Reply"?

### Analysis:
The strange behavior you are observing is that the ARP Reply, which is intended for a non-existent MAC address, still reaches VM 1. This can be explained by the following:

1. **ARP Table Caching:**
   - Check the ARP table on VM 2 to see what MAC address it has cached for VM 1. It is possible that VM 2 already has the legitimate MAC address of VM 1 cached due to previous communications before the MAC address was spoofed. 
   - When VM 2 receives the ARP Request with the spoofed MAC address, it may still use the cached MAC address to send the ARP Reply, causing the reply to be directed back to the real MAC address of VM 1.

2. **Broadcast Nature of ARP:**
   - ARP Requests are broadcast messages, and ARP Replies are unicast. However, if the network switch or router is not properly filtering the unicast ARP Reply, it might be delivered to VM 1 even though the destination MAC address is spoofed.

3. **Network Configuration:**
   - Ensure that there are no misconfigurations in the network setup, such as VLAN settings or switch port configurations, that might allow the ARP Reply to be delivered to VM 1 despite the spoofed MAC address.

### Conclusion:
The behavior you are seeing is not typical and suggests that the ARP table on VM 2 might be caching the real MAC address of VM 1. To further investigate, check the ARP table on VM 2 and verify the network configuration to ensure proper filtering of unicast ARP Replies.
