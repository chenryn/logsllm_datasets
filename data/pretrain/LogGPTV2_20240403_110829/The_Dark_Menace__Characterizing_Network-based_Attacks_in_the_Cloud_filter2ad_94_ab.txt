tection. Such spread-based detection of brute-force attacks has also
been used in prior work [31]. We choose 10 and 20 Internet IPs
as the threshold for brute-force and spam, respectively, and 30 con-
nections for SQL in the sampled NetFlow, as recommended by the
cloud security team.
Signature-based: Although packet payloads are not logged in our
NetFlow data, we can still detect some attacks by examining the
TCP ﬂag signatures. Port scanning and stack ﬁngerprinting tools
use TCP ﬂag settings that violate protocol speciﬁcations (and as
such, they are not used by normal trafﬁc ) [6, 40]. For instance, the
TCP NULL port scan sends TCP packets without any TCP ﬂags,
and the TCP Xmas port scan sends TCP packets with FIN, PSH,
and URG ﬂags (Table 1). If a VIP receives a packet with an illegal
TCP ﬂag setting during a time window, we mark the time window
as under an attack. Since the NetFlow data is sampled, even a single
logged packet may represent a signiﬁcant number of packets with
illegal TCP ﬂag settings in the original trafﬁc.
Communication pattern based: Previous security studies have
identiﬁed blacklists of IPs in the Internet. We can identify attacks
by ﬁltering VIP trafﬁc communicating with such blacklisted IPs.
For example, the Trafﬁc Distribution System (TDS) [37] includes
a list of dedicated hosts that deliver malicious web content on the
Internet. Since these hosts are hardly reachable via web links from
legitimate sources, it is likely that cloud VIPs communicating with
these hosts are involved in malicious web activities. In particular,
these VIPs are either a victim of inbound attacks (e.g., spam, ma-
licious advertising) or that they have been compromised to launch
outbound attacks (e.g., drive-by downloads, scams, and phishing).
Note that it is not always possible to infer the direction of an at-
tack involving TDS nodes because some SYN packets may not get
sampled in the NetFlow data. Thus, we distinguish the inbound
from outbound communication pattern based attacks based on the
destination IP in the ﬂow records.
Counting the number of unique attacks. Given the attacks in
each one minute time window, we identify the attack incidents that
last multiple time windows for the same VIP. Due to NetFlow’s
low sampling rate, we may not be able to detect an attack over its
entire duration. Therefore, similar to previous work [38, 40, 48],

we group multiple attack windows as a single attack where the last
attack interval is followed by T inactive windows (i.e., no attacks).
Instead of selecting a ﬁxed T , we choose to select different T
for different attacks based on analyzing the distributions of inactive
times between two consecutive attack minutes of each type for both

The
spam trafﬁc came from hundreds of VIPs towards thousands of ex-
ternal mail servers from email providers such as Yahoo and Lycos,
enterprises like CenturyLink, and small clouds like SoftLayer. We
observed prevalent on-off trafﬁc pattern from the spamming VIPs.
Speciﬁcally, each VIP generated slow rate spam trafﬁc with a me-
dian of 2266 packets per second over a median of one hour period.
It then subsided completely over a median of 5 hours, and launched
new attacks again. We investigated these VIPs with the security
team and found that most of these VIPs are free trial accounts which
were quickly shut down. About 98% of these VIPs were new with
no spam trafﬁc recorded before, and the remaining ones were slow
spammers lasting up to a month.
Brute-force attacks: Remote connection protocols like SSH, RDP
(Remote Desktop Protocol), and VNC (Virtual Network Comput-
ing) often have just a few connections to a single VIP. If we observe
many connections in the sampled NetFlow, they are likely caused
by malicious behaviors such as password guessing (i.e., brute-force
attacks). We observed that inbound brute-force attacks have a me-
dian of 24 distinct hosts communicating with a single VIP just in
the sampled NetFlow data (i.e., there are likely other Internet hosts
communicating with the VIP that are not in our sampled data). At
the tail, a VIP can receive SSH trafﬁc from up to 10K distinct hosts
from the sampled NetFlow data. This can be caused by an attacker
controlling multiple Internet hosts to try out different passwords in
parallel. Outbound brute-force attacks have a median of 60 distinct
hosts targeted by the same VIP in the sampled NetFlow data. This
may be because the VIP is scanning a set of Internet servers with
the same set of passwords. There are about 4 times more outbound
brute-force attacks than inbound and more SSH-based brute-force
attacks compared to the RDP ones, likely because the servers run-
ning in the cloud often use random ports (e.g., for RDP), and thus
they are less likely to experience brute-force attacks compared to
Internet hosts.
SQL injection attacks: Some attackers send a variety of malware
SQL queries to exploit the vulnerability of SQL servers [16, 18].
Although these attacks are in the application layer, we can still ob-
serve such attacks in the network layer when there is a large number
of connections issued towards SQL database servers. It is likely that
they are exploiting all possible malformed user inputs to gain unau-
thorized access [16]. There are about 5 times more outbound SQL
attacks compared to the inbound attacks.
Port scan: We observe many inbound port scan attacks such as
TCP NULL and Xmas attacks. For example, we observed inbound
trafﬁc of 125k TCP NULL packets per second lasting for 4 minutes.
Attackers usually leverage these packets to sneak through ﬁrewalls
and packet ﬁlters that only handles normal TCP packets [6]. More-
over, there is a signiﬁcant number of inbound TCP RST packets,
which are likely caused by Internet hosts spooﬁng the IPs in the
cloud, leading to TCP RST signals to be directed to VIPs inside the
cloud. There are much fewer outbound port scans.
Malicious web activities (TDS): There are 0.039% of VIPs in-
volved in communicating with TDS hosts in the Internet. These
TDS hosts often use source ports uniformly distributed between
1024 and 5000. There is one attack incident with 89 unique In-
ternet TDS IPs communicating with a single VIP with 31K packets
per second lasting for 98 minutes.
Summary: There are more outbound attacks than inbound attacks
(64.9% vs 35.1%). This implies that it is relatively easier for at-
tackers to abuse cloud resources to launch outbound attacks than
to attack the cloud-hosted tenants due to improved security over
the years. At the same time, new security mechanisms need to

inbound and outbound attacks, as shown in Figure 1. We select the
T value by generating a linear regression line between each point
and the 99 percentile of each attack distribution curve and check-
ing that the average R-squared [28] value for regression models of
inbound and outbound curves is above 85%. We summarize the
inactive timeout values we use for different attacks in Table 1.
3. ATTACK OVERVIEW AND VALIDATION
In this section we ﬁrst give an overview of each type of inbound
and outbound attack observed in our study. For validation, we com-
pare these detected attacks using inbound attack alerts from DDoS
security appliances and the attack incident reports.
3.1 Attack Overview
Figure 2 shows the distribution of inbound and outbound attacks;
absolute counts omitted due to conﬁdentiality and privacy concerns.
Flood attacks: Flood attacks (TCP, UDP, ICMP ﬂoods) in the
Internet domain have been widely studied [39], and they can be
launched in both inbound and outbound directions. Our analysis
identiﬁed a signiﬁcant increase of inbound ﬂood attacks during Nov
and Dec compared to May (breakdown by month not shown), pos-
sibly to disrupt the e-commerce sites hosted in the cloud during the
busy holiday shopping season. UDP ﬂoods are often against media
services hosted in the cloud and on HTTP ports. We also observe
that there are about 5 times more outbound TCP SYN and about
2 times more UDP ﬂoods than inbound. This is likely because it
is easier for attackers to leverage cloud resources to attack Internet
users, while it is harder to attack the cloud where operators have
high level of security expertise and many attacks ﬂoods can be ﬁl-
tered by commercial security appliances.
DNS reﬂection attacks: The DNS reﬂection attack is one of the
most common ampliﬁcation attacks in the Internet. It has received
increasing attention from DDoS protection services [10, 17].
In
DNS reﬂection attacks, attackers send DNS requests toward mul-
tiple open DNS servers with spoofed source address of the target,
which results in a large number of DNS responses to the target from
DNS servers. Since the cloud has its own DNS servers to answer
DNS queries from hosted tenants, there should not be any DNS re-
sponses from the Internet to the cloud. Therefore, any activity of
inbound DNS responses may signify a potential DNS reﬂection at-
tack. Inbound DNS reﬂection attacks often come from up to 6K
distinct sources (with 1500 byte full-size packets). We only ob-
served outbound DNS responses from a single VIP hosting a DNS
server at 5666 packets per second for a couple of days repeatedly.
Spam: Email services often communicate with a stable number of
clients at any given time. If we see a large deviation in the num-
ber of email ﬂows, they are likely to be spam. For instance, we
observed an outbound spam eruption on a single day, which ac-

be developed to reduce the outbound attacks. The inbound attacks
are dominated by ﬂood attacks, brute-force attacks, port scan, and
TDS attacks, while the outbound attacks are dominated by ﬂood at-
tacks, brute-force attacks, SQL attacks, and TDS attacks. While our
study focuses on characterizing the diversity of cloud attacks, com-
paring across attack categories (e.g., by impact, trafﬁc thresholds)
may also reveal interesting insights. However, deﬁning a universal
metric to compare attack types is difﬁcult because it requires nor-
malizing the attack data across diverse metrics e.g., quantifying the
impact of an attack in terms of the service downtime, privacy com-
promise, and the number of users impacted. Further, some of these
measures may not be known till long after the attack happened. In
Section 4, we study one aspect of how VIPs are affected by different
attacks and leave the broader analysis to future work.
3.2 Validation
In a large heterogeneous network, it is difﬁcult to verify whether
all the detected attacks are real because it requires a snapshot of the
actual trafﬁc and the runtime application and system state before
and during the attack. This problem becomes even harder given the
coarsely sampled NetFlow data available for our analysis. We col-
lect the security records including alerts from the DDoS protection
hardware appliances for inbound attacks and the incident reports for
outbound attacks. We compare our detected attacks with the alerts
and incident reports to identify the attacks we miss. Note that the
cloud provider deploys software and hardware security appliances
to safeguard against these attacks so they should not be interpreted
as impacting the infrastructure or tenants.
Inbound attacks: The cloud provider detects and mitigates in-
bound attacks using a combination of software and hardware DDoS
protection appliances. These appliances generate alerts about TCP
SYN ﬂoods, UDP ﬂoods, ICMP ﬂoods, and TCP NULL scan. Note
that on hardware security appliances, the trafﬁc thresholds are typ-
ically set to handle only the high-volume attacks (low-volume at-
tacks don’t cause any impact to the cloud infrastructure due to high
network capacity) over a large time window, and these appliances
aggregate multiple incidents together that occur close in time. There-
fore, to do a side-by-side comparison with alerts from these devices,
we also ﬁrst group the attacks we detected based on the VIP, attack
type and time window. We found that 73.2% of these attack in-
stances were correlated. This is due to the fact that we set the trafﬁc
thresholds to (a) cover a broad range of inbound attacks, and (b)
detect these attacks in their early stages. To check the latter hypoth-
esis, we measured the detection latency of hardware security ap-
pliances by randomly sampling a few attack instances over a week
and observed that these appliances detected them after an order of
tens of seconds delays on average. In comparison, our detection ap-
proach (in ofﬂine mode) signaled the attack based on the NetFlow
data for these instances within a minute.
Table 2 shows the number of alerts in each type and those alerts
that we also detected. Overall, we successfully identiﬁed 78.5% of
the alerts from hardware security appliances in our detected attacks.
The remaining alerts are missed by our detection approach because
of the low sampling in the NetFlow data and the false positives of
these alerts. For other types of attacks, the cloud relies on individual
tenants to detect and report them. However, we did not have the
ground truth data to validate them.
Outbound attacks. The cloud security team detects every poten-
tial outbound attack, but they do not necessarily log all of them
as incident reports to avoid false positives. Speciﬁcally, only the
cases of anomalous activity reported by external sites are logged
as incidents. Similar to inbound attacks, the cloud provider uses
security appliances to mitigate the outbound attacks. The cloud se-
curity team may receive a complaint from an ISP when they notice
malicious trafﬁc originating from the cloud provider. Given such a
complaint, the security team checks the logs of security appliances
and investigates the corresponding tenant proﬁle and payment in-
formation, and generates an incident report. Moreover, when the
security team receives a complaint, the team may do trafﬁc analy-
sis for deeper investigation; they may also perform the VHD (Vir-
tual Hard Disk) forensic analysis on behalf of the customer if the
customer (who owns the VHD) requested it. Based on these in-
vestigations, the security team creates incident reports logging their
ﬁndings such as the “attack” or “no attack found” label. We use
NetSieve [45] to extract the attack information from these incident
