Module loaders, such as SystemJS, typically require that module paths point to a valid file, including the `.js` extension. While some resources, like ExploringJS, suggest that the file extension may not always be necessary, the default behavior regarding this in the module loader specification is still under consideration. To ensure the broadest compatibility for your code, it would be beneficial to have an option within the compiler to automatically append the `.js` extension to module paths.
