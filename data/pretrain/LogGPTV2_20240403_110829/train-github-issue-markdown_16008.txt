Module loaders like systemjs expect module paths to point to a valid file
path, including the .js extension. Although exploringjs says the extension
might not be needed, the module loader spec's default behaviour has not yet
been decided upon. So for code to have the widest possible support it would be
good to have an option to tell the compiler to add the extension.
