### Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ

#### 1. Handling Subsystem Termination
- **Subsystem Not Found**: If the reply indicates that the subsystem is not found, it suggests that the subsystem was in the process of terminating when the first command was issued. If a dump is being taken, the subsystem might take some time to terminate. A message will be produced at the console before termination.
- **Channel Initiator Check**: To verify if the channel initiator is working, issue the `DISPLAY DQM` command. If the response does not show the channel initiator as active, this could be due to insufficient resources (e.g., processor). Use z/OS monitoring tools like RMF to determine if there is a resource problem. If no resource issues are found, restart the channel initiator.

#### 2. Abnormal Termination
- **Queue Manager or Channel Initiator**: Check if the queue manager or channel initiator has terminated abnormally. Look for messages indicating that the address space has abnormally terminated. If you receive a message indicating that the system action is to terminate IBM MQ, check if a system dump was produced. For more information, see "IBM MQ Dumps."

#### 3. Slow Running IBM MQ for z/OS
- **Performance Issues**: Consider that IBM MQ for z/OS might still be running but slowly, indicating a potential performance problem. To confirm this, refer to Step “10” on page 62. For further guidance, see "Dealing with Performance Problems."

### AMQP Service
- **Logs and Configuration Files**:
  - **Server-Side Logs**:
    - FDC files: `WMQ data directory\errors\AMQ nnn.n.FDC`
    - Log path: `WMQ data directory\Qmgrs\qMgrName\errors\amqp.log`
    - Output: `WMQ data directory\Qmgrs\qMgrName\amqp.stdout` and `WMQ data directory\Qmgrs\qMgrName\amqp.stderr`
  - **Configuration Files**:
    - AMQP configuration file: `amqp_win.properties` on Windows, `amqp_unix.properties` on AIX or Linux
    - Directory: `WMQ data directory\Qmgrs\qMgrName\amqp`
  - **JVM Properties**: Set Java properties in `java.properties` for the AMQP service.
  - **JAAS Configuration**: Configure JAAS using the `service.env` file.

### Client-Side Files
- **Client-Side Log Files and Configuration Files**: Refer to "Developing AMQP Client Applications" for information on client-side applications.

### Advanced Message Security (AMS)
- **Troubleshooting AMS Problems**: Information to help identify and resolve problems related to AMS.
- **Error Logs**: Check the queue manager error log for AMS-related issues.
- **Trace for AMSM Address Space**: Enable trace using the `_AMS_MSG_LEVEL` variable.
- **Collecting Information for AMS Problems**: Collect troubleshooting information to send to IBM Support.
- **Common Errors**:
  - `com.ibm.security.pkcsutil.PKCSException: Error encrypting contents`: Verify JCE security policy in `JAVA_HOME/lib/security/local_policy.jar/*.policy`.
  - **OSGi Support for AMS**: Additional parameters required for OSGi bundle with AMS.
  - **Problems Opening Protected Queues**: Workarounds for issues when opening protected queues with JMS.

### Command Problems
- **Resolving Problems with MQSC Commands**:
  - Ensure correct use of redirection operators.
  - Verify the queue manager is running.
  - Specify the queue manager on the `runmqsc` command.
  - Do not specify an MQSC command as a parameter of the `runmqsc` command.
  - Issue the `runmqsc` command before entering MQSC commands.
  - Do not run control commands from `runmqsc`.

### Initializing the Command Environment
- **setmqenv Command**: Use the `setmqenv` command to initialize the current environment so that the operating system can find the appropriate IBM MQ commands.
  - **Procedure**:
    1. Locate the `setmqenv` command on the file systems.
    2. Initialize the environment using the `setmqenv` command.

By following these steps and references, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues with IBM MQ.
