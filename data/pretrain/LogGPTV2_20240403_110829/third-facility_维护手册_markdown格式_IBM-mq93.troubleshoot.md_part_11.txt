• If the reply indicates that the subsystem is now not found, this indicates that it was in the
process of terminating when the first command was issued. If a dump is being taken, the
subsystem might take a while to terminate. A message is produced at the console before
terminating. To check that the channel initiator is working, issue the DISPLAY DQM command.
If the response does not show the channel initiator working this could be because it is getting
insufficient resources (like the processor). In this case, use the z/OS monitoring tools, such as
RMF, to determine if there is a resource problem. If it is not, restart the channel initiator.
c)Check whether the queue manager or channel initiator terminated has abnormally.
Look for any messages saying that the queue manager or channel initiator address space has
abnormally terminated. If you get a message for which the system action is to terminate IBM MQ,
find out whether a system dump was produced. For more information, see IBM MQ dumps.
d)Check whether IBM MQ for z/OS might still be running.
Consider also that IBM MQ for z/OS might still be running, but only slowly. If it is running slowly,
you probably have a performance problem. To confirm this, see Step “10” on page 62. For advice
about what to do next, see Dealing with performance problems.

Location of AMQP logs, error logs, and
configuration files
Find the logs, error logs, and configuration files used by AMQP.
Note: The examples are coded for Windows systems. Change the syntax to run the examples on AIX or
Linux systems.
Server-side logs
The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) service writes FDC files to the IBM MQ error directory:
WMQ data directory\errors\AMQ nnn.n.FDC
The format of the FDC files is AMQPn.FDC.
It also writes a log for the AMQP service. The log path is:
WMQ data directory\Qmgrs\qMgrName\errors\amqp.log
The format of the log file is amqp_n.log.
Starting the queue manager starts the AMQP service. Output is written to:
WMQ data directory\Qmgrs\qMgrName\amqp.stdout
WMQ data directory\Qmgrs\qMgrName\amqp.stderr
Server-side configuration files

The AMQP configurations file name is amqp_win.properties file on Windows systems, and the
amqp_unix.properties file on AIX or Linux systems. The properties files are saved in the AMQP
configuration directory:
WMQ data directory\Qmgrs\qMgrName\amqp

JVM
Set Java™ properties that are passed as arguments to the AMQP service in the file,
java.properties. The properties in the file are passed directly to the JVM running the AMQP
service. They are passed as additional JVM properties on the Java command line. Properties
set on the command line take precedence over properties added to the command line from the
java.properties file.
Find the java.properties file in the same folder as the AMQP configurations. See Figure 1 on page
65 and Figure 2 on page 65.
Modify java.properties by specifying each property as a separate line. Format each property
exactly as you would to pass the property to the JVM as an argument. For example:
-Xmx1024m
-Xms1024m
JAAS
The JAAS configuration file is described in Configuring JAAS for AMQP channels, which includes the
sample JAAS configuration file, JAAS.config, shipped with IBM MQ AMQP.
If you configure JAAS, you are almost certainly going to write a class to authenticate users to replace
the standard JAAS authentication procedures.
To include your Login class in the class path used by the AMQP service class path, provide an IBM
MQ service.env configuration file.
Set the class path for your JAAS LoginModule in service.env. You cannot use the variable,
%classpath% in service.env. The class path in service.env is added to the class path already
set in the AMQP service definition.
Display the class paths that are being used by the AMQP service by adding echo set classpath to
runAMQPService.bat. The output is sent to amqp.stdout.
The default location for the service.env file is:
WMQ data directory\service.env
Override these settings with a service.env file for each queue manager in:
WMQ data directory\Qmgrs\qMgrName\service.env
CLASSPATH= WMQ Installation Directory\amqp\samples\samples
Note: service.env must not contain any variables. Substitute the actual value of WMQ
Installation Directory.

within the OSGi bundle.
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 67
Problems opening protected queues when using AMS with JMS
Various problems can arise when you open protected queues when using Advanced Message Security.
You are running JMS and you receive error 2085 (MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME) together with error
JMSMQ2008.
You have verified that you have set up your AMS as described in Quick Start Guide for AMS with Java
clients.
There are a number of IBM MQ options that are either not supported, or have limitations for Advanced
Message Security; details are described in Known limitations of AMS.
You have not set the AMQ_DISABLE_CLIENT_AMS environment variable.
Resolving the problem
There are four options for working around this problem:
1.Start your JMS application under a supported IBM Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
2.Move your application to the same machine where your queue manager is running and have it connect
using a bindings mode connection.
A bindings mode connection uses platform native libraries to perform the IBM MQ API calls.
Accordingly, the native AMS interceptor is used to perform the AMS operations and there is no reliance
on the capabilities of the JRE.
3.Use an MCA interceptor, because this allows signing and encryption of messages as soon as they arrive
at the queue manager, without the need for the client to perform any AMS processing.
Given that the protection is applied at the queue manager, an alternate mechanism must be used to
protect the messages in transit from the client to the queue manager. Most commonly this is achieved
by configuring TLS encryption on the server connection channel used by the application.
4.Set the AMQ_DISABLE_CLIENT_AMS environment variable if you do not want to use AMS.
For more information, see Message Channel Agent (MCA) interception and AMS.
Note: A security policy must be in place for each queue that the MCA Interceptor will deliver
messages onto. In other words, the target queue needs to have an AMS security policy in
place with the distinguished name (DN) of the signer and recipient matching that of the
certificate assigned to the MCA Interceptor. That is, the DN of the certificate designated by
cms.certificate.channel.SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN property in the keystore.conf used by the
queue manager.
Troubleshooting command problems
There are a number of common problems that might occur when you are trying to run a command.
About this task
Some characters, for example, backslash (\) and double quote (") characters have special meanings when
used with commands. If you receive an error when you use special characters in descriptive text of a
command, check whether you have entered the special characters correctly. For more information about
characters with special meanings and how to use them, see Characters with special meanings.

Resolving problems with MQSC commands
If you cannot get MQSC commands to run, use the information in this topic to see if any of these common
problems apply to you. It is not always obvious what the problem is when you read the error that a
command generates.
Procedure
• If you are redirecting input from a file, ensure that you use the  redirection operator.
By default, the file is put in the current working directory at the time runmqsc is invoked. Specify a
fully-qualified file name to send your output to a specific file and directory.
• Check that you have created the queue manager that is going to run the commands, and that the
queue manager is running, by using the following command to display all queue managers:
dspmq
If the queue manager is not running, start it. For more information, see Starting a queue manager.
• Ensure that you specified a queue manager on the runmqsc command, or that you have a default
queue manager defined.
If you have not defined a default queue manager, or you get this error:
AMQ8146E: IBM MQ queue manager not available.
• Check that you are not attempting to specify an MQSC command as a parameter of the runmqsc
command. You cannot specify an MQSC command as a parameter of the runmqsc command. For
example, this is not valid:
runmqsc DEFINE QLOCAL(FRED)
• Check that you have issued the runmqsc command. You cannot enter MQSC commands before you
issue the runmqsc command.
• Check that you are not attempting to run a control command from runmqsc. You cannot run control
commands from runmqsc. For example, you cannot issue the strmqm command to start a queue
manager while you are running MQSC commands interactively. If you do this, you receive error
messages similar to the following message:
runmqsc

Administering by using MQSC commands
Initializing the current command environment with setmqenv
If you receive an error message indicating that an IBM MQ command is unknown or unavailable, use the
setmqenv command to initialize the current command environment so that the operating system can find
the appropriate command.
About this task
Each operating system uses the directories in the PATH environment variable to determine which program
to run. If none of the directories in the current PATH environment variable include an executable program
of the specified name, this causes the operating system to respond with a message indicating that it could
not locate the command, as shown in the following examples:
• On UNIX and Linux:
% dspmqver
ksh: dspmqver: not found.
%
• On Windows:
C:\> dspmqver
'dspmqver' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
To resolve this issue, you should use the setmqenv command to initialize the current environment so that
the appropriate IBM MQ commands can be located and executed by the operating system.
Procedure
1.Locate where the setmqenv command is on the available file systems.
• On UNIX and Linux:
% find / -name setmqenv 2>/dev/null
...
%
• On Windows:
C:\> dir /b /s C:\setmqenv.cmd
...
C:\>
Note: If multiple drive letters exist, they may be included, for example: C:\> dir /b /s
C:\setmqenv.cmd D:\setmqenv.cmd .
Directories with source, or Maint can be ignored since they almost always refer to a backup copy of
the command created during the installation of a fix pack.
2.Use the setmqenv command to initialize the current environment.
