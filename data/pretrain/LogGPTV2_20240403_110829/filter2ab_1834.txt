### Title: BlackHat EU-19: Doors of Durin - The Veiled Gate to Siemens S7 Silicon

**Abstract:**

Siemens is a leading provider of industrial automation components, particularly for critical infrastructures. Their S7 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) series is one of the most widely used in the industry. In recent years, Siemens has integrated various security measures into their PLCs, including firmware integrity verification at boot time using a separate bootloader code. This bootloader code is stored in a separate SPI flash and is not publicly accessible via Siemens' website.

In this presentation, we will share our in-depth investigation of the bootloader code running on the Siemens S7-1200 PLC and its potential security implications. Our research reveals that the bootloader, which has been present in S7-1200 PLCs since at least 2013, contains an undocumented "special access feature." This feature can be activated by sending a specific command via UART within the first half-second of the PLC booting. Once activated, it provides limited read and write access to the memory during the boot process through the UART interface.

We discovered that this special access feature can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the PLC and to dump the entire PLC memory, similar to a cold-boot attack. This vulnerability could potentially compromise the existing security ecosystem established by Siemens. However, if properly managed, this feature could also serve as a valuable forensic tool for asset owners.

The talk will include a live demonstration of our findings to illustrate the potential risks and benefits of this hidden feature.

**Key Points:**
- **Investigation Focus:** Security analysis of the Siemens S7-1200 PLC bootloader.
- **Undocumented Feature:** A special access feature in the bootloader, activatable via UART during the initial boot phase.
- **Security Implications:** Potential for executing arbitrary code and dumping PLC memory.
- **Dual Use:** Exploitation for malicious purposes or as a forensic tool.
- **Live Demo:** Demonstration of the findings and their practical applications.

This presentation aims to highlight the importance of continuous security assessments and the potential dual-use nature of such features in industrial control systems.
