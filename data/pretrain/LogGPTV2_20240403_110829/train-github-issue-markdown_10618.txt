  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Display all meta tags in `` by using `next/head`
## Current Behavior
I need to provide 6 meta tags with the same property `fb:pages` and only the
last one is displayed in the source code. I guess this is to avoid duplicated
meta tags with the same `property` or `name`.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Provide multiple meta tags with the same property or name in ``
  2. Check the source code
