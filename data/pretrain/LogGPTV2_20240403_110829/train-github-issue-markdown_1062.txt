I'm using PR4 and when generating a Doctrine crud with routes the UrlMatcher
contains duplicate GOTO commands.  
I tried adding a prefix to the imported routes but that did not work.
If I remove the method requirements in the CRUD routes there is no longer a
duplicate GOTO in the UrlMatcher.
I'm including my bundle routes (which includes the generated CRUD routes) in
the main routing.yml file. If I include the CRUD routes directly into the main
routing.yml everything works.
