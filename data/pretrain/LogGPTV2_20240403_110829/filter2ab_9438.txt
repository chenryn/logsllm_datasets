### Title: BlackHat Asia 2022 - The Next Generation of Windows Exploitation: Attacking the Common Log File System

**Abstract:**

The Common Log File System (CLFS) is a high-performance, universal log file subsystem introduced in Windows Vista. In this session, we will delve into our research on CLFS, covering the following key areas:

1. **Attack Surface Analysis:**
   - We will discuss the process of identifying and analyzing the attack surface of CLFS.
   - This includes understanding the various components and functionalities that make up the CLFS, and pinpointing potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Fuzzing and Vulnerability Discovery:**
   - We will detail our approach to designing targeted fuzzing techniques to identify vulnerabilities within CLFS.
   - Specific findings from our fuzzing efforts will be presented, including a vulnerability prepared for the Tianfu Cup competition.

3. **Exploit Development:**
   - We will explore the exploitation of the discovered vulnerabilities, focusing on the historical methods commonly used and their limitations.
   - A new, universal exploit method will be disclosed, which addresses some of the shortcomings of traditional approaches.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Finally, we will demonstrate how to combine CLFS with the newly developed exploitation methods to achieve complete privilege escalation, even under challenging conditions such as pool overflow vulnerabilities.

This session aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the next generation of Windows exploitation, with a focus on the Common Log File System, and to share insights and techniques that can be applied to future security research and defense strategies.
