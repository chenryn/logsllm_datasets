Abstract—Recent work on intrusion-tolerance has shown that
resilience to sophisticated network attacks requires system repli-
cas to be deployed across at least three geographically distributed
sites. While commodity data centers offer an attractive solution
for hosting these sites due to low cost and management over-
head, their use raises signiﬁcant conﬁdentiality concerns: system
operators may not want private data or proprietary algorithms
exposed to servers outside their direct control.
We present a new model for Byzantine Fault Tolerant repli-
cated systems that moves toward “intrusion tolerance as a
service”. Under this model, application logic and data are only
exposed to servers hosted on the system operator’s premises.
Additional offsite servers hosted in data centers can support the
needed resilience without executing application logic or accessing
unencrypted state. We have implemented this approach in the
open-source Spire system, and our evaluation shows that the
performance overhead of providing conﬁdentiality can be less
than 4% in terms of latency.
I. INTRODUCTION
Intrusion tolerance, or the ability to operate correctly even
while partially compromised by an attacker, is an increasingly
important concern for high value systems. Critical
infras-
tructure, such as power grid Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA), represents one example. Because these
systems are targets for sophisticated nation-state-level attacks,
there has been considerable research on how to make them
intrusion tolerant
through Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)
replication of the control servers (e.g. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]).
While this line of work has led to solutions that can provide
strong correctness and performance guarantees in the face of
sophisticated attacks, in order for it to have an impact on
real systems, it must be deployed, and correctly deploying
and managing intrusion-tolerant replicated systems remains
challenging. There have been efforts to make this easier (e.g.
through the development of tools like BFT-SMaRt [6], [7]),
but it still requires a relatively high level of expertise. In the
power grid domain, it is unlikely to be feasible for every utility
operator to develop and maintain this expertise in-house [8],
and this is likely to be true across other domains as well.
Further complicating the deployment and management of
intrusion-tolerant services, recent work shows that resilience
to sophisticated network attacks that can isolate a targeted site
from the rest of the network requires a signiﬁcantly higher
number of system replicas than traditional BFT systems and
requires them to be deployed across at least three geographi-
cally distributed sites [4]. Commodity data centers offer an at-
tractive solution to reduce the cost and management overhead
of constructing and operating the additional required sites,
and the work in [4] shows how existing power grid control
centers can be augmented with additional data center sites to
create a cost-effective solution. However, using commodity
data centers raises signiﬁcant conﬁdentiality concerns [8]: for
many applications, system operators are likely to consider
exposing private data or proprietary algorithms to servers
outside their direct control to be an unacceptable trade-off.
We present a new model for BFT systems that moves toward
offering “intrusion tolerance as a service”. Under this model,
application logic and data are only exposed to servers hosted
on the system operator’s premises. However, the intrusion-
tolerant system architecture can be designed by a service
provider, and additional offsite servers can be hosted in data
centers managed by the service provider to provide the needed
resilience to system compromises and network attacks. These
offsite servers participate in the BFT replication protocol, but
do not execute application logic and only store encrypted state
and updates. We show that our approach is able to provide the
same resilience to system compromises and network attacks
as in [4], without requiring application state and logic to be
exposed to data center replicas.
We implement our new partially cloud-based architecture
and protocols in Conﬁdential Spire, a SCADA system for
the power grid based on Spire 1.2 [4], [9]. We evaluate
the performance overhead of providing conﬁdentiality in an
emulated power grid SCADA setup and ﬁnd that Conﬁdential
Spire only adds an overhead of about 2ms compared to
Spire 1.2 when tolerating one intrusion (less than 4% increase
in latency), and an overhead of 6.8ms when tolerating two
intrusions (less than 13% increase in latency). In both cases,
latency is below 100ms for all requests, meeting the timing
requirements of power grid SCADA systems [10], [11].
The contributions of this work are:
• The design of the ﬁrst BFT system that can leverage
offsite data centers to achieve resilience to simultaneous
network attacks and system compromises, without requir-
ing conﬁdential state or algorithms to be exposed to data
center servers.

• Extensions to the basic system to provide well-deﬁned
conﬁdentiality guarantees in the case that an on-premises
server is compromised.
• An implementation and evaluation of the system in the
context of SCADA for the power grid. We show that
the performance overhead of providing conﬁdentiality is
acceptable, and the system can meet the latency require-
ments of power grid SCADA.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
A. BFT Basics
Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) state machine replication
is a well-known technique to provide intrusion tolerance,
enabling a system to guarantee safety (correctness and consis-
tency of the system state) and liveness (progress in processing
updates) even if up to some threshold number of replicas are
compromised (e.g. [12]). The number of tolerated compro-
