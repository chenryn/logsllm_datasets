User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Graphical Ping utility with logging I need to continuously test the quality of the connection between hosts, and I would like to use ping for that, in order to see WHEN the problem occurs.

It should provide LOG of the pinging, with timestamps of each ping.

Any suggestions for such utility?

Yeah, sorry, Windows!  Preferably install and run.  Like, for dummy admins :)

Assistant: Try EMCO Ping Monitor. It looks like it has it ALL :)
