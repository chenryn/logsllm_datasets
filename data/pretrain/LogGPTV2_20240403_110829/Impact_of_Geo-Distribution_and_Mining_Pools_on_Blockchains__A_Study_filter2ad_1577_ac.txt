### Opportunity for Transaction Censorship by Mining Pools

Our analysis reveals that Ethereum mining pools regularly have the opportunity to temporarily censor transactions for more than two minutes. Historically, we have recorded events where censorship could last up to three minutes.

During a one-month measurement period, we observed that prominent mining pools were able to mine sequences of blocks as long as nine. Figure 7 illustrates the lengths of consecutive blocks mined by the top five mining pools. Specifically, Ethermine managed to mine four sequences of eight consecutive blocks, while Sparkpool was able to generate two sequences of nine consecutive blocks.

At the time of our measurements, Ethermine's miners collectively held 25.9% of the total computational power on the Ethereum platform [20]. The theoretical probability of mining a sequence of eight consecutive blocks is \(0.259^8 = 2 \times 10^{-5}\). Given that there were 201,086 blocks in the main chain over one month, the expected number of times Ethermine would mine eight consecutive blocks is approximately 4 (i.e., \(2 \times 10^{-5} \times 201,086 \approx 4\)), which matches our observations. For Sparkpool, with a theoretical probability of mining nine consecutive blocks of \(0.2269^9\), it should take at least three months to achieve this (i.e., \(0.2269^9 \times 201,086 \approx 0.3\)). However, Sparkpool managed to do so twice in a single month.

Since the blocks were not announced all at once, as would be the case in a block withholding attack, and they exhibited an average inter-block time, it is unlikely that Sparkpool engaged in such an attack [24].

### Current Finality Values and Their Implications

The current values used to consider a block as final are overly optimistic given the fraction of mining power currently held by mining pools. To further support this observation, we analyzed the entire blockchain beyond our one-month experiment. We found 102, 41, 4, and 1 sequences of 10, 11, 12, and 14 consecutive blocks, respectively. The longest sequence ever recorded, consisting of 14 blocks, was mined by Ethermine from block height 5,899,411 to 5,899,424. Assuming Ethermine's computational power was similar to its current level (0.259), the probability of such a long sequence occurring would be around once in 1,000 years.

### Related Work

Previous research has examined decentralization, a key feature distinguishing blockchain from traditional centralized systems, and its importance for resisting transaction censorship [10], [17], [25], [26]. Luu et al. [25] reported that about 80% of Ethereum's mining power is concentrated in fewer than ten mining pools, which aligns with our findings. Gencer et al. [10] demonstrated that both Bitcoin and Ethereum suffer from centralized mining processes due to mining pools. Miller et al. [17] showed that 75% of Bitcoin's mining power is controlled by just 2% of the nodes. Eyal and Sirer [26] described an attack on Bitcoin that prevents decentralization, where rational miners join a self-interested group, leading to a majority. Our observations confirm these hypotheses and show that Ethereum mining pools have the power to temporarily censor transactions and harm their commit time by mining long sequences of blocks.

### Transaction Commit Time

Previous studies have focused on the time required for a transaction to commit [1], [8], [19]. Nakamoto [1] showed that the probability of a Bitcoin block containing a transaction not being replaced by a malicious block can be made arbitrarily high. Buterin [19] studied the corresponding probability for Ethereum. In Bitcoin, a block is considered safe after six blocks, or one hour, whereas in Ethereum, this is achieved after 12 blocks, or about three minutes [8]. In our one-month observations, we noted two instances where a single mining pool mined nine consecutive blocks twice. Additionally, we observed that a mining pool was able to mine a sequence of 14 consecutive blocks over the entire history of the blockchain. This indicates that mining pools can indeed censor transactions and rewrite the blockchain, raising concerns about network security.

### Causes of Empty Blocks

Previous work has attempted to describe the reasons for mining empty blocks [27], [28]. In our study, we found that 1.43% of Ethereum blocks are empty, and most mining pools mined empty blocks, suggesting that doing so is profitable.

### Lessons Learned

Our experiment highlighted the strengths and challenges of the Ethereum network, revealing some unexpected behaviors. The low propagation delay is a strength, but mining pool centralization can lead to selfish behaviors. Commit delays in Ethereum have improved relative to previous studies, partly due to shorter inter-block times [20]. However, we identified selfish behaviors, such as empty blocks and one-miner forks, which distort Ethereum's incentive model and waste system resources. These behaviors were not anticipated in the original design [2] and are tolerated by current implementations. While such behaviors were relatively rare, they were consistently observed, indicating that they are profitable for selfish nodes and may become more frequent and impactful in the future.

### Recommendations

To address one-miner forks, we suggest that the Ethereum protocol should prohibit referencing uncles mined by miners who have already mined a main block at the same height. This would save approximately 1% of the platform's computational resources and increase the chances of small miners receiving rewards. Additionally, we observed that in 56% of cases, mining pools used their full mining power to mine different versions of the same block at the same height. In the remaining 44% of cases, they mined different blocks with distinct transaction sets. Our solution would effectively deter mining pools from using their full mining power to mine different versions of the same block in more than half of the one-miner fork cases.

### Conclusion

We have documented our experience studying the Ethereum network from multiple geographically dispersed observation points. We identified previously undocumented forms of selfish behavior and showed that powerful mining pools exacerbate the geographical impact on block propagation delays. We provide open-source measurement and processing tools, along with the collected data set, to promote further research on permissionless blockchains.
