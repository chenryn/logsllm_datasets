### 7.8 Summary and Outlook

Our evaluation indicates that the additional latency imposed by VEX and its variants is relatively low (tens of milliseconds per auction) and primarily results from an additional round of communication. Network costs are moderate (hundreds of bytes per bid), while storage costs for the auctioneer, although considerable, remain manageable. Auctioneer throughput is reasonable, with one of the optimized VEX variants imposing an overhead of approximately 2×. The audit-to-auction ratio, in terms of the expense of an audit, is 1 for every 18 auctions for VEX-CP and 1 for every 160 auctions for VEX-NOCC. This ratio suggests that a significant fraction of auctions could be audited. The primary cost during the auction phase is the bidders' commitment generation, which is comparable to proof generation and verification in the audit phase, accounting for about 1.2 ms of CPU time.

### 8. Other Related Work

We have covered work on hash chains and zero-knowledge range proofs in Sections 3 and 7.7. Below, we discuss three categories of research: online advertising, secure auctions, and general-purpose auditing.

#### Online Advertising
Privad [31], Adnostic [51], and work by Juels [35] focus on ad networks rather than ad exchanges. Their primary concern is user privacy, whereas our focus is on the integrity of auctions. Reznichenko et al. [47] develop auction protocols, but their goal is also user privacy in ad networks. Recent work by Dave et al. [23] and Haddadi [32] focuses on measuring, detecting, and preventing fraudulent clicks in online ad networks. This work could complement VEX by helping to defend against attacks on impression delivery (§5.3). Stone-Gross et al. [49] characterize different types of fraudulent activity in ad exchanges, such as click fraud and keyword stuffing, but unlike VEX, their work assumes the correctness of the ad exchange itself. Muthukrishnan [39] provides a general overview of ad exchanges and poses nine theoretical problems ranging from mechanism design to the development of a verifiable ad exchange. We address the latter problem with VEX.

#### Secure Auctions
A significant body of work in secure auctions focuses on privacy [19, 34, 40]. While valuable, this work is orthogonal to our focus. Other work [17, 30, 37, 44–46, 50] recognizes the importance and challenges of designing verifiable online auctions and proposes several schemes based on novel cryptographic techniques and distributed protocols. A summary of the most relevant work follows.

The work by Rabin et al. [45] is the most recent in a line of research [44, 46] aimed at ensuring auction integrity. This work achieves stronger guarantees than VEX (e.g., their scheme does not require disclosing the auction’s sale price to verify its proper conduct) and reports impressive performance results. However, as the authors acknowledge, these performance results correspond to a construction with a soundness (probability of detecting an incorrect outcome) of only 25%. Amplifying this rate would require bidders to submit a large number of commitments, leading to substantial computational, storage, and communication costs.

Some work [30, 37, 50] proposes splitting the role of the auctioneer into multiple parties. These schemes aim to prevent misbehavior (as opposed to merely detecting it, as in VEX). The tradeoff is that they require a non-collusion assumption among some of the parties. While this is a reasonable assumption in many cases, the centralized nature of ad exchanges makes this approach less applicable to our requirements (§4.1).

#### Auditing
General-purpose auditing systems, such as PeerReview [33], provide strong guarantees that would benefit ad exchanges but require participants (and their public keys) to be well-known. SPIDeR [61], though not directly applicable to auctions, shares a similar ethos with VEX: it uses low-cost, weak cryptographic primitives coupled with careful design to achieve security guarantees.

### 9. Discussion and Conclusion

As mentioned in the introduction and described in Section 5, VEX has limitations. We now return to two of them. First, VEX has undeniable overhead. However, this overhead is not excessive and is consistent with the cost of cryptographic guarantees in systems. Second, the auctioneer can manipulate auctions by selecting participants, colluding with a bidder, or labeling auctions as non-auditable. Under our analysis, these are the only actions the auctioneer can take. Given the nature of the problem—billions of latency-sensitive auctions per day, unknown participants, and the weak guarantees provided by the integer comparison protocol (§3)—we were initially uncertain about providing any guarantees. Therefore, we are pleased that the guarantees (§4.2, §5.1) appear strong enough for practical use.

A natural avenue for future work is to broaden VEX's applicability to other ads, auctions, and contexts. For other ads, we have assumed impression ads; we need to determine if VEX applies to cost-per-click ads and other types. For other auctions, we expect that VEX's core protocol, under generalizations, can verify k-price auctions (winning bidder pays the k-highest bid), generalized Vickrey auctions (m items allocated to m bidders, who pay the m-1 highest bid), and modified second-price auctions (the highest bidder pays the second-highest bid plus a fixed amount). For other contexts, we have phrased the core protocol in terms of ads (Figures 4–8), but we believe the design is mostly independent of this context. With minor modifications, it should apply to eBay, online funding platforms, and other online auctions.

This is not to say that misbehavior is rampant in these contexts, but verifiability would be beneficial: it would strengthen the service given to auction participants while lowering the barrier to entry for new auctioneers by reducing the trust required.
