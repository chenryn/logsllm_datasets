of  FORCTDDB  by  finding  the  number  of  effective 
defects per unit area and duty cycle. That is, we need to 
find the number of pFETs and nFETs over the area of 
the structure that lie along critical paths and their duty 
cycle. In addition, assume that breakdown at the source 
and  at  the  drain  area  are  independent,  thus  counting 
each  separately  as  a  failure  or  defect  if  it  is  fatal.  
Assuming the SOFR model, the FIT of basic structures 
is straightforwardly computed as the sum of the FITs 
of  pFET  and  nFET  devices  belonging  to  those 
structures.  
Table 2 lists the number of effective defects (ED), 
duty  cycle  of  devices,  and  the  fatality  of  breakdown 
(NF:  non-fatal;  F:  fatal)  over  the  area  of  various 
structures,  from  which  the  FIT  can  be  found.  We 
assume  that  precharge  transistors  are  always  stressed 
except  the  time  when  the  corresponding  bitlines  are 
accessed. We also assume that precharge takes half of 
the clock cycle and bitline access takes the other half 
of  the  cycle.  As  a  result,  the  average  duty  cycle  of 
precharge transistors is 1-Nreads/cycle/(2·Nlbls·Nreadports) for 
register files and 1-(Nreads/cycle+Nwrites/cycle)/(2·Nlbls·Nports) 
for arrays,  where Nlbls is the number of local bitlines. 
On  the  other  hand,  pass  transistors  are  under  stress 
only when the corresponding bitlines are accessed. 
†  Since  NBTI  occurs  only  on  negatively  biased  pFET  devices,  the 
pFETs for transmission gates in latches and multiplexers are stressed 
only  if  the  gate  of  the  pFETs  is  low  and  the  transmission  gates  pass 
high (0.5 of the probability assumed in the table). 
‡ For wire repeaters, pFETs in every other repeater are under stress at 
a time.

4.4. Discussion 
In the subsections above, we describe the FIT rate 
of  microarchitecture  structures  due  to  each  of  failure 
mechanisms.  To  combine  FIT  rates  across  different 
failure  mechanisms,  the  one-time  quantification  of 
FORC for the failure mechanisms needs to be done for 
a  given  technology  and  implementation  style.  Then, 
the total FIT rate can be computed by multiplying the 
FITs of the structure in terms of FORC by the value of 
FORC  for  the  corresponding  failure  mechanism  and 
adding the computed FIT values, assuming the SOFR 
model.  Furthermore,  to  combine  FIT  rates  across 
multiple structures, the total FIT rate of the structures 
computed in this way can be simply added.

accurately evaluated by the SOFR model. As a result, a 
reliability  model  which  improves  this  limitation  is 
needed for more accurate reliability modeling.  
5. Related Work 
There has been enormous research to model failure 
mechanisms at the device level, but only some of well-
accepted models for failure mechanisms under study in 
this paper are discussed in this section. For EM, J. R. 
Black  proposed  a  mean-time-to-failure  model  (often 
called Black’s equation) which has been widely used to 
predict the lifetime of conductor lines [3]. C.-K. Hu et 
al.  proposed  an  EM  model,  particularly  for  copper 
conductor lines and low-k dielectric material [5]. The 
effect of bidirectional current on EM lifetime has been 
studied  theoretically  and  experimentally  in  [17]  and 
[6],  respectively.  For  NBTI,  the  extensive  work  of 
modeling the NBTI failure mechanism is summarized 
in  [7],  along  with  fundamentals  of 
the  failure 
mechanism  and  the  impact  of  various  process  and 
device parameters on NBTI lifetime. For TDDB, E.Y. 
Wu et al. proposed a mean-time-to-failure model [15] 
which  is  used  in  this  paper.  Other  TDDB  models 
proposed thus far are extensively summarized in [18]. 
There has also been much work to incorporate these 
device-level  failure  models  into  the  circuit-level.  UC 
[11]  and  Cadence®  Virtuoso® 
Berkeley  BERT 
UltraSim  [19]  are  the  most  well-known  lifetime 
reliability circuit simulators. The simulator features to 
predict and validate timing and reliability due to EM, 
NBTI,  TDDB  and/or  HCI  (hot-carrier  injection)  are 
implemented in such a way as to be compatible to the 
SPICE or FastSPICE circuit simulator. 
Compared  to  that  at  the  device-  and  circuit-level, 
lifetime reliability modeling at the architecture-level is 
rather a daunting one. J. Srinivasan et al. proposed an 
architecture-level  lifetime  reliability  model,  called 
RAMP [2]. Since RAMP was developed to model the 
lifetime  of  processor  cores,  some  of  its  assumptions 
such  as  uniform  device  density  and  identical  device 
vulnerability  make  RAMP  less  accurate,  especially 
when one extends it to cover the entire chip. Z. Lu et 
al. proposed an EM model by accounting for dynamic 
thermal  and  current  stress  on  conductor  lines  [4]. 
While  the  proposed  model  attempts  to  embrace  the 
impact  of  discontinuous  stress  on  the  lifetime  of 
conductor lines, maximum temperature across the chip 
and the worst-case current density specified at design 
time were used in the model.

In  this  paper,  we  address  the  issue  of  modeling 
lifetime reliability metrics at the architecture level. We 
propose  a  framework  for  architecture-level  lifetime 
reliability  model  and  present  a  new  concept  called 
FITs of reference circuit (FORC) that allows architects 
to  quantify  failure  rates  without  having  to  deal  with 
circuit-  and 
the 
implemented  architecture.  The  proposed  framework 
along with a cycle-accurate architecture simulator will 
allow an accurate estimation of the FIT rates of various 
types of microprocessor chips. In addition, the FORC-
based approach allows relative performance-reliability 
trade-off  to  be  evaluated  to  make  educate  design 
decisions, especially at the early design stage. 
technology-specific  details  of 
In addition, the impact of typical microarchitectural 
features to enhance chip lifetime, such as redundancy, 
needs to be carefully modeled to allow the exploration 
of area, power, and performance trade-offs. To do so, 
some  of  underlying  assumptions  used  in  this  paper 
need to be improved in such a way that the FIT rates of 
redundant  components  can  be  effectively  combined. 
Finally,  the  impact  of  technology  scaling  on  lifetime 
reliability  also  can  be  revisited  by  using  our  FORC-
based reliability model.
