#### Calculation of FIT for TDDB
To calculate the FIT (Failures in Time) for Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB), we need to determine the number of effective defects per unit area and the duty cycle. Specifically, this involves finding the number of pFETs and nFETs over the area of the structure that lie along critical paths and their respective duty cycles. We assume that breakdown at the source and drain areas are independent, and each should be counted separately as a failure or defect if it is fatal.

Using the SOFR (Sum of Failure Rates) model, the FIT of basic structures can be computed as the sum of the FITs of the pFET and nFET devices within those structures.

**Table 2** lists the number of effective defects (ED), the duty cycle of devices, and the fatality of breakdown (NF: non-fatal; F: fatal) over the area of various structures. From these values, the FIT can be derived.

We assume that precharge transistors are always under stress except when the corresponding bitlines are accessed. Precharge takes half of the clock cycle, and bitline access takes the other half. Therefore, the average duty cycle for precharge transistors is given by:
- For register files: \(1 - \frac{N_{\text{reads}}}{\text{cycle}} / (2 \cdot N_{\text{lbls}} \cdot N_{\text{readports}})\)
- For arrays: \(1 - \frac{(N_{\text{reads}} + N_{\text{writes}})}{\text{cycle}} / (2 \cdot N_{\text{lbls}} \cdot N_{\text{ports}})\)

where \(N_{\text{lbls}}\) is the number of local bitlines. Pass transistors, on the other hand, are under stress only when the corresponding bitlines are accessed.

- **Note 1:** Since Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) occurs only on negatively biased pFET devices, the pFETs for transmission gates in latches and multiplexers are stressed only if the gate of the pFETs is low and the transmission gates pass high (0.5 probability assumed in the table).
- **Note 2:** For wire repeaters, pFETs in every other repeater are under stress at a time.

**Table 2.** The number of effective defects (EDs) and duty cycle for TDDB modeling for various microarchitecture structures. The devices in the table are indexed with letters in Figure 7. The fatality of breakdown (NF: non-fatal; F: fatal) is also given for the source (Src) and drain (Drn) area. We assume that breakdown at the source and at the drain area are independent, thus counting each separately as a failure or defect if it is fatal.

| Number of EDs | Duty Cycle | Structure | Device | Fatality (Src/Drn) |
|---------------|------------|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| \(2 \cdot N_{\text{cells}} \cdot N_{\text{ports}} / N_{\text{cells}} / N_{\text{lbls}}\) | \(T_0\) | Array | a, b | NF/NF |
| \(N_{\text{cells}}\) | \(T_1\) | Register file (devices in the cell are the same as those in array) | c, f | NF/F |
| \(4 \cdot N_{\text{cells}} \cdot N_{\text{ports}}\) | \(T_0\) | d, e | F/F |
| \(2 \cdot N_{\text{cells}}\) | \(T_1\) | g, h | NF/F |
| \(N_{\text{cells}} \cdot N_{\text{readports}} / N_{\text{cells}} / N_{\text{lbls}}\) | \(T_0\) | j, i | F/F |
| \(2 \cdot N_{\text{cells}} \cdot N_{\text{readports}}\) | \(T_1\) | k, l | F/F |
| \(2 \cdot N_{\text{cells}} \cdot N_{\text{writeports}}\) | \(T_0\) | m, n | NF/F |
| \(N_{\text{cells}} \cdot N_{\text{readports}}\) | \(T_1\) | o, p | F/F |
| \(2 \cdot N_{\text{latches}}\) | \(T_0\) | Latch | q, r | NF/F |
| \(N_{\text{latches}}\) | \(T_1\) | s, t, u, v | F/F |
| \(2 \cdot N_{\text{repeaters}}\) | \(T_0\) | Wire repeater | w, x | F/F |
| \(2 \cdot N_{\text{mux}} \cdot N_{\text{inputs}}\) | \(P_{\text{fatal}} \cdot N_{\text{NFETs}}\) | Datapath Logic gate | y, z | F/F |

**Notes:**
- **†** Simultaneous multiple breakdowns may cause circuit failure.
- **‡** The fatality is determined by the circuits where the devices belong.

#### Discussion
In the previous sections, we described the FIT rate of microarchitecture structures due to various failure mechanisms. To combine FIT rates across different failure mechanisms, a one-time quantification of FORC (FITs of Reference Circuit) for the failure mechanisms needs to be done for a given technology and implementation style. The total FIT rate can then be computed by multiplying the FITs of the structure in terms of FORC by the value of FORC for the corresponding failure mechanism and adding the computed FIT values, assuming the SOFR model. Furthermore, to combine FIT rates across multiple structures, the total FIT rates of the structures can be simply added.

In our reliability model, the impact of microarchitectural features that enable redundancy and improve lifetime reliability has yet to be taken into account due to the limitations of the SOFR model [2]. The first component failure causes the microarchitecture to fail, even in the presence of redundancy. As a result, a more advanced reliability model is needed for accurate reliability modeling.

#### Related Work
There has been extensive research on modeling failure mechanisms at the device level. This section discusses some well-accepted models for the failure mechanisms studied in this paper. For Electromigration (EM), J. R. Black proposed a mean-time-to-failure model (Black’s equation) widely used to predict the lifetime of conductor lines [3]. C.-K. Hu et al. proposed an EM model, particularly for copper conductor lines and low-k dielectric material [5]. The effect of bidirectional current on EM lifetime has been studied theoretically and experimentally in [17] and [6], respectively.

For NBTI, the extensive work on modeling the NBTI failure mechanism is summarized in [7], along with the fundamentals of the failure mechanism and the impact of various process and device parameters on NBTI lifetime. For TDDB, E.Y. Wu et al. proposed a mean-time-to-failure model [15] used in this paper. Other TDDB models are extensively summarized in [18].

Several tools have been developed to incorporate these device-level failure models into the circuit-level. UC Berkeley BERT UltraSim [11] and Cadence® Virtuoso® are well-known lifetime reliability circuit simulators. These simulators feature the ability to predict and validate timing and reliability due to EM, NBTI, TDDB, and HCI (hot-carrier injection) in a way that is compatible with SPICE or FastSPICE circuit simulators.

Compared to device- and circuit-level modeling, architecture-level lifetime reliability modeling is more challenging. J. Srinivasan et al. proposed an architecture-level lifetime reliability model called RAMP [2]. However, RAMP's assumptions, such as uniform device density and identical device vulnerability, make it less accurate, especially when extended to cover the entire chip. Z. Lu et al. proposed an EM model that accounts for dynamic thermal and current stress on conductor lines [4]. While this model attempts to embrace the impact of discontinuous stress on the lifetime of conductor lines, it uses the maximum temperature across the chip and the worst-case current density specified at design time.

#### Conclusion
In this paper, we address the issue of modeling lifetime reliability metrics at the architecture level. We propose a framework for architecture-level lifetime reliability modeling and introduce a new concept called FITs of reference circuit (FORC) that allows architects to quantify failure rates without dealing with the technology-specific details of the implemented architecture. The proposed framework, combined with a cycle-accurate architecture simulator, will enable accurate estimation of the FIT rates of various types of microprocessor chips. Additionally, the FORC-based approach allows for the evaluation of relative performance-reliability trade-offs, aiding in informed design decisions, especially at the early design stage.

The impact of typical microarchitectural features, such as redundancy, on enhancing chip lifetime needs to be carefully modeled to explore area, power, and performance trade-offs. Some underlying assumptions used in this paper need to be improved to effectively combine the FIT rates of redundant components. Finally, the impact of technology scaling on lifetime reliability can be revisited using our FORC-based reliability model.
