User: How can I open a Python interpreter at a specific network path in Windows?
In the Explorer address bar the path is in UNC form: \\myhost\myshare\....
I can't work out how to change to this directory from the Windows command line, nor in what format I could pass it as an argument to os.chdir.
I'm running Python 2.5 on Windows XP. IDLE is installed.
Thanks!
Assistant: You need to map it as a drive.
