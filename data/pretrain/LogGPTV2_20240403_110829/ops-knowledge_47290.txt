User: As subject, is is possible with just one source code, we can deploy our code to Openshift or Google App Engine? Heroku is not necessarily in my case. 
My application is using Python Flask + PostgreSQL 9.1. I love the easiness in Openshift when I configure my technology stack, but is the case will be same with GAE?
Thanks!
Assistant: PostgreSQL is not available on GAE, so this code will definitely not run there.
