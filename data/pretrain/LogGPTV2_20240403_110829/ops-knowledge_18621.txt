User: I am trying to start python 3.3.3 within a shell buffer in emacs (GNU emacs 24.2). OS is Win7. If I start python from the regular command line, the program works well. If I open a shell buffer in emacs (M-x shell) and type "python" into the command line (the program is in the path), it prints "python" on a new line and stops there.
Any ideas what I am doing wrong?
Assistant: Sounds like a bug. Try a workaround: load python-mode first, then open the shell interactively. This will provide some setup, which might cure it.
With shipped python.el M-x run-python RET
With python-mode.el M-x python[VERSION] RET
VERSION is optional, it provides non-default shells without re-customizing the variable holding the command-name, i.e. py-shell-name
