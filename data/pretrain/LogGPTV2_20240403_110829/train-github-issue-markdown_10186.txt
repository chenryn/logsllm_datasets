    1. What is a short input program that triggers the error?
    package main
    const a string = b(0)
    func main() {
        println(a)
    }
    2. What is the full compiler output?
    test.go:3: undefined: b
    test.go:3: cannot use b(0) as type string in const initializer
    test.go:6: internal compiler error: naddr: const string
    Interestingly, changing the const line to either:
    const a = b(0)
    or
    const a int = b(0)
    gets rid of the internal compiler error (but not the other errors, of course).
    3. What version of the compiler are you using?  (Run it with the -V flag.)
