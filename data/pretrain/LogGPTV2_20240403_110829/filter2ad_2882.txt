## Abstract
We present a demonstration of SCION, a next-generation Internet architecture designed for the 21st century. This demonstration showcases SCION's rich features, including DDoS defense, native multipath communication, and high-speed anonymous routing, along with its ease of deployment.

## 1. Motivation
The current Internet has exceeded all expectations, permeating nearly every aspect of modern society. Even brief service interruptions can have catastrophic consequences on government, economic, and social operations. However, the Internet was not designed to address the increasingly adversarial challenges of today, such as malicious Internet providers, oppressive regimes, mass surveillance, and criminal organizations launching denial-of-service attacks.

Over the past few decades, various patches have been proposed to improve security and resilience. These solutions, however, are constrained by the Internet's design, business model, and legal contracts.

In this demonstration, we show how to deploy SCION, a new Internet architecture that is explicitly designed to bypass known security problems, offer high availability, and scale to accommodate the needs of millions of users and devices for the next decades. Specifically, SCION aims to achieve the following goals:
1. High availability even in the presence of (distributed) adversaries.
2. Transparency and control over Internet paths and cryptographic keys.
3. Efficiency, scalability, and extensibility of the involved procedures.
4. Support for heterogeneous trust.
5. A feasible deployment strategy.

## 2. The SCION Internet Architecture
Before delving into the specifics of our demonstration, we provide a brief overview of SCION. SCION, which stands for Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-Generation Networks, has undergone more than five years of research, involving over 70 person-years of development.

### 2.1 Isolation Domains (ISDs)
The main building block of SCION is the concept of Isolation Domains (ISDs). An ISD logically groups a set of Autonomous Systems (ASes), each under a uniform administration. An ISD is administered by one or multiple ASes, forming the ISD Core. An ISD contains one or multiple regular ASes and is governed by a policy negotiated by the ISD Core. This policy defines the roots of trust used to validate bindings between named entities and their public keys (certificates) or addresses (DNS).

An AS wishing to join an ISD purchases service from an existing AS within that ISD, thereby accepting the ISD's policy. Large ISPs are expected to constitute the ISD's Core ASes, and their associated customers would also participate in the ISD.

### 2.2 Routing in SCION
SCION uses a two-level routing system: intra-ISD and inter-ISD. Both levels leverage Path-segment Construction Beacons (PCBs) for path discovery and establishment. The Core AS of an ISD announces a beacon and disseminates it as a policy-constrained multi-path flood, either within an ISD (to discover intra-ISD paths) or amongst ISD Core ASes (to discover inter-ISD paths). The beacons collect AS-level path information (cryptographically protected at each hop) as they traverse the network. These tokens are chained together by a source to create data transmission paths that traverse a sequence of ASes. Packets in SCION contain AS-level path information, eliminating the need for maintaining inter-domain routing tables at border routers. This concept is referred to as Packet-Carried Forwarding State.

### 2.3 Multipath Communication
Unlike the current Internet, SCION natively supports multipath communication at the network layer. The SCION network socket supports multipath by default, forwarding traffic over the k best (preferably disjoint) paths, where k is a configurable parameter. This increases availability and hampers espionage and surveillance. Additionally, SCION's multipath socket offers explicit route control, allowing users to avoid or blacklist certain regions, a unique feature not available in today's Internet.

### 2.4 Extensibility via SCION Extensions
SCION allows for a wide range of extensions, easily integrated into the core architecture. These include DDoS protection, high-speed anonymous communication, and bump-in-the-wire connectivity for endhosts.

## 3. Ease of Deployment
We present four different scenarios for deploying and using SCION:

### 3.1 Native Deployment
A native SCION deployment does not rely on BGP-based information for providing end-to-end connectivity. This ensures connectivity regardless of the state of the global BGP system. A native deployment requires dedicated physical machines installed in various ISPs, running SCION infrastructure elements such as border routers, beacon servers, and path servers. In this scenario, SCION's security and availability properties are at their highest. We refer to contiguous deployments as SCION islands. Our early deployment includes a SCION island in Switzerland, with the participation of ISPs Swisscom and SWITCH, as well as our own infrastructure at ETH Zurich. In our demo, we will showcase an intuitive and easy-to-use management interface designed to simplify administration and manage SCION ASes.

### 3.2 SCION HTTP(S) Forward and Reverse Proxy
The SCION HTTP(S) Proxy allows browsing the Web over a SCION infrastructure. It consists of a forward proxy and a reverse proxy. The forward proxy, running on an endhost, takes incoming HTTP(S) requests from a standard web browser and puts them onto a SCION multipath socket. The reverse proxy, running on a different endhost, receives this traffic, converts it back to HTTP(S) traffic, and fetches the requested website from the targeted Web server. In our demo, we will show our Chrome Web browser extension, which serves as a command and control center for the proxy and visualizes traffic statistics and controls various features such as ISD blacklisting.

### 3.3 SCION VPN Gateway
SCIONizer, the SCION VPN Gateway, routes VPN traffic over the SCION network. It receives VPN traffic (UDP) from off-the-shelf commercial VPN software, converts it into SCION multipath-UDP (MPUDP) packets, and sends them over the SCION network. The remote SCION VPN Gateway receives these MPUDP packets, converts them back into UDP packets, and delivers them to the intended endpoint.

### 3.4 DENA Box
The DENA (Device for ENhancing Availability) box is a bump-in-the-wire interface device placed between a customerâ€™s network and the Internet provider. It aims to allow end-users to use SCION without performing complicated tasks such as configuring network devices or updating to a new network stack. The DENA device identifies the presence of a peer, establishes SCION paths for failover, continuously measures the packet loss rate, and fails over to a SCION path if necessary.
