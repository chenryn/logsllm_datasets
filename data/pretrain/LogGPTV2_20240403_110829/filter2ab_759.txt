### Title: DroidGuard: A Deep Dive into SafetyNet

**Abstract:**

SafetyNet is an Android component developed by Google to verify the integrity of devices. This system is used by developers to ensure that their applications only run on devices that meet specific security requirements. Additionally, Google employs SafetyNet to prevent bots, fraud, and abuse.

In 2017, Collin Mulliner and John Kozyrakis presented one of the first public overviews of SafetyNet, providing a glimpse into its internal mechanisms. Since then, the Google anti-abuse team has significantly enhanced the solution's robustness. One major improvement was the transition of most of the original Java-based layer of SafetyNet into a native module called DroidGuard. This module implements a custom virtual machine (VM) that executes proprietary bytecode provided by Google to perform device integrity checks.

The purpose of this talk is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current implementation of SafetyNet, with a focus on the internal mechanisms of the DroidGuard module. We will cover the following topics:

- **Overview of the VM Design:** An in-depth look at the architecture and design of the custom VM within DroidGuard.
- **Internal Mechanisms:** Detailed exploration of how the VM operates and the processes it uses to execute the integrity checks.
- **Security Checks:** A thorough examination of the various security checks performed by SafetyNet, including detection of:
  - Magisk
  - Emulators
  - Rooted devices
  - Pegasus

By the end of this presentation, attendees will have a clear understanding of the current state-of-the-art in SafetyNet and DroidGuard, as well as the sophisticated methods used to ensure the integrity of Android devices.
