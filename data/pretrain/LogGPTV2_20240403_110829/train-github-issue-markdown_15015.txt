Having a layer of validation on the browser is great, but most of the time the
guesser gets it all wrong!
Take this example: If you create a boolean field on an entity and let the
guesser do its work, it sets the field as a required checkbox.  
How can one choose the false option then?
The same happen with text fields.  
If the column is not nullable but I'm not validating it's content, an empty
value is just saved as an empty string on the db…  
… unless you have HTML5 validation enabled on your browser. Why don't the type
guesser don't follow what the rest of the application is doing?
Maybe the guesser should set the "required" atribute only when the field is
explicitly validated with NotBlank or NotNull.
