I only have one encoder, but it lists 50+ encoder variables in the side bar
(see attached). This also happens for my decoder. I presume that it is
duplicating the variables for each time step? Notice that it says 500+ inputs!
Also, the graph becomes unwieldy and barely loaded in Safari (crashed in
Chrome, wouldn't load in Firefox), and is displayed with a _very_ long list of
variable names (see attached).
