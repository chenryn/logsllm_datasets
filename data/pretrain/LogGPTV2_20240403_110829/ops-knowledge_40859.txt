User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why doesn't the client's web browser need to be PCI compliant? A hypothetical online store that accepts credit card payment will have to be PCI compliant because it receives (transmit), process and possibly store credit card numbers.

But the client's web browser is also transmitting a credit card number, albeit on a secure connection, but after receiving in plain text from the keyboard.

We can't make every browser out there PCI compliant, but I can't find any reference in the specification.

Where is it written that a client's web browser need not be PCI compliant ?

Assistant: Well, first, what is written is the following: payment card companies are requiring merchants to be PCI-DSS compliant. PCI-DSS does not apply to anybody who doesn't process credit card transactions. The DSS requirements specify access control, logging, etc. None of this is applicable to a cardholder.

Clients do not have the same contracts as merchants. There is no benefit in trying to log activity on a client machine. Individual card numbers are likely to be stolen in many places, and the cost / benefit on forensic analysis of one person's computer for their one lost credit card is somewhere below sane. Finally, people just won't accept that. If using a credit card is too hard, card issuers will see decreased volume.
