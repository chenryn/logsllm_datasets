User: In a script , I want to run a .exe  with some command line parameters as "-a",and then
redirect the standard output of the program to a file?
How can I implement that?
Assistant: Easiest is os.system("the.exe -a >thefile.txt"), but there are many other ways, for example with the subprocess module in the standard library.
