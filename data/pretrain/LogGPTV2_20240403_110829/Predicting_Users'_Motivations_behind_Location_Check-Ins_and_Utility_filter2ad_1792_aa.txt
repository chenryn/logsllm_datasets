## Abstract
Location check-ins on social networks provide both geographical and semantic information about visited venues, often in the form of tags (e.g., "restaurant"). Such data can reveal personal information beyond what users intend to disclose, posing a privacy risk. In this paper, we investigate the motivations behind location check-ins and quantify the impact of a privacy-preserving technique, generalization, on the perceived utility of these check-ins. Through a targeted user study on Foursquare (N = 77), we find that the motivation behind check-ins mediates the loss of utility caused by generalization. We propose a machine-learning method to determine the motivation behind each check-in and design a predictive model for utility. Our results show that the model accurately predicts the utility loss due to semantic and geographical generalization, enabling the design of utility-aware, privacy-enhancing mechanisms in location-based social networks.

## 1. Introduction

Online social networks (OSNs) such as Facebook and Foursquare allow users to share their location information with others. This feature is popular, with 30% of users attaching locations to their posts [36]. The reasons for sharing locations include connecting with social circles and projecting an interesting image of themselves [27, 28], achieving goals beyond simply disclosing geographical information [12, 21].

When users check in to a place or event on location-based social networks (LBSNs), they implicitly reveal the geographical coordinates and semantic information of the venue. For example, checking in to a restaurant discloses the exact location and its type, represented by tags like "burger joint" (which could be a descendant of the "restaurant" tag in a hierarchical tree). This can lead to the exposure of additional private information, such as complete location traces, co-travelers, and activities [7, 30, 35]. Risks are even higher when users share semantic information, as activity patterns can be inferred and used to track users more effectively.

To protect privacy, users can obfuscate their location information at both the geographical and semantic levels. For instance, a user might generalize the venue's semantic information by sharing "restaurant" instead of "burger joint," or generalize the geographical location by sharing the city instead of the full address. While this reduces the chances of being tracked, it may also reduce the perceived quality of service (utility).

Given the difficulty for users to estimate privacy risks and the inconvenience of manually selecting obfuscation levels, automatic obfuscation mechanisms are needed. These mechanisms must balance privacy and utility by quantifying the effects of obfuscation. Although formal frameworks exist for quantifying location privacy [30], few studies address the utility loss due to obfuscation [15, 23, 31]. This paper provides a methodology to predict the perceived utility loss from obfuscation in LBSNs, enabling the design of personalized privacy protection mechanisms.

The problem of predicting utility loss due to obfuscation is closely tied to understanding why users share their location. We propose inferring the user's motivation for sharing and then predicting the utility implications of privacy-protection mechanisms. This helps determine the acceptable level of obfuscation. For example, a user might only want to convey that they are "eating" in a city without revealing the specific venue, or they might need the full address if inviting friends to a restaurant.

Using machine learning algorithms, we predict the user's motivation for a check-in and the perceived utility loss for different levels of obfuscation. Our methodology, tested on an online survey involving 77 Foursquare users (45 check-ins per user), can predict the purpose of check-ins (among 13 pre-selected purposes) with a 43% correct classification rate and the effect of obfuscation on utility (on a scale from 1 to 5) with a mean prediction error of 0.66.

Our survey results also highlight the greater negative impact of semantic obfuscation (e.g., "restaurant" instead of "burger joint") on perceived utility compared to geographic obfuscation (e.g., city instead of full address).

In summary, our contributions are:
1. A methodology to infer the motivations behind location check-ins and their effect on perceived utility loss due to different levels of obfuscation.
2. A utility loss function for designing usable location privacy-protection mechanisms.
3. An empirical study of the trade-off between utility and privacy in Foursquare based on user survey results.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1. Motivations behind Location Sharing

Several studies have investigated the motivations for sharing locations in OSNs. Patil et al. [27, 28] conducted two online user studies (N = 401 and N = 362) and found that users primarily share locations to connect with social circles and project an interesting image. Cramer et al. [5] performed a qualitative study (N = 20 interviews, N = 47 surveys) and identified utilitarian purposes for check-ins, such as coordinating with friends. While these studies provide valuable insights, none address the inference of motivations and the design of utility models for obfuscated check-ins.

### 2.2. Location Obfuscation

Location privacy is a well-studied topic, with various obfuscation techniques proposed, including generalization, adding noise, hiding information, and changing identifiers [1, 4, 11, 15, 17]. Brush et al. [3] studied user preferences and concerns for these techniques, highlighting a lack of awareness of long-term threats. Tang et al. [32] showed that different visualizations of shared locations affect users' attitudes towards privacy. Micinski et al. [23] explored the relationship between location obfuscation and application usability, but no study has focused on the utility implications of obfuscation in LBSNs.

### 3.1. Online Survey

We conducted an online survey with 77 Foursquare users, each providing 45 check-ins. The survey aimed to understand the motivations behind check-ins and the perceived utility loss due to different levels of obfuscation.

### 3.2. Motivation and Utility Inference Framework

We designed a framework to infer the user's motivation for each check-in and predict the utility loss for different levels of obfuscation. This framework uses machine learning algorithms to classify check-in motivations and model utility loss.
