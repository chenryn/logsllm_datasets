Abstract—Location check-ins contain both geographical and
semantic information about the visited venues, in the form of
tags (e.g., “restaurant”). Such data might reveal some personal
information about users beyond what they actually want to
disclose, hence their privacy is threatened. In this paper, we study
users’ motivations behind location check-ins, and we quantify the
effect of a privacy-preserving technique (i.e., generalization) on
the perceived utility of check-ins. By means of a targeted user-
study on Foursquare (N = 77), we show that the motivation behind
Foursquare check-ins is a mediator of the loss of utility caused
by generalization. Using these ﬁndings, we propose a machine-
learning method for determining the motivation behind each
check-in, and we design a motivation-based predictive model for
utility. Our results show that the model accurately predicts the
loss of utility caused by semantic and geographical generalization;
this model enables the design of utility-aware, privacy-enhancing
mechanisms in location-based social networks.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Online social networks (OSNs), such as Facebook and
Foursquare, allow their users to share location information with
each other. Such a feature is quite popular, as 30% of users
attach locations to their posts [36]. The reason for sharing
locations include the desire to connect with users’ social
circles and to project an interesting image of themselves [27],
[28], thus achieving a goal greater than simply disclosing
geographical information [12], [21].
By checking-in to a place or an event, on so-called location-
based social networks (LBSNs), such as a restaurant or a
gathering, users implicitly accept to reveal the geographical
coordinates and the semantic information of the place. For
example, when they check in to a restaurant, users reveal
the exact location of that restaurant, as well as its type or

category, represented in the form of tags, such as “burger joint”
(venue types are usually selected from a pre-deﬁned set of tags,
organized as a hierarchical tree, where the “burger joint” tag
could be a descendant of the “restaurant” tag.). This might
lead to the exposure of additional private information beyond
what they intended to share. A collection of location check-
ins by a set of users can lead to their re-identiﬁcation and
also an inference of more personal information (e.g., complete
location trace, co-travelers, activities) [7], [30], [35]. The risks
are even higher when users share semantic information as well.
For example, activity patterns can be learned at the semantic
level (e.g., users go to cinemas after dining in restaurants) and
subsequently used to better track users’ locations.
To protect their privacy, users can obfuscate their location
information, both at the geographical and semantic levels. For
example, a user can generalize1 the semantic information of
the venue by sharing, for example, “restaurant” instead of
“burger joint”. The user can also generalize the geographical
location of the venue by sharing, for instance, the city instead
of the full address of the venue. Location obfuscation decreases
the chances that a curious entity can track the location and
activities of the user over time, hence it increases the user’s
privacy. However, this might come at the cost of a reduction
in her perceived quality of service (i.e., utility).
Because it is difﬁcult for users to estimate the privacy risks
that stem from location sharing (it usually requires to perform
statistical inference [30]) and because it would be cumbersome
for users to manually select the level of obfuscation to apply
to each of their check-ins, automatic obfuscation mechanisms
are needed (note that automatically generated privacy recom-
mendations are valuable as well [18]). In order to balance
privacy and utility, such mechanisms must be able to quantify
the effect of obfuscation on both privacy and utility. Formal
frameworks have been proposed to quantify location privacy,
e.g., [30]. However, few studies address the utility loss due to
location obfuscation for particular location-based services [15],
[23], or the utility loss in a formal framework for ﬁnding
the optimal balance between utility and privacy [31]. Despite
these studies,
there is no methodology for modeling and
predicting the perceived utility loss that stems from the use of

case of obfuscation by addition of fake information, as proposed in the context
of location privacy, is left to future work.
obfuscation mechanisms in location-based social networks for
each individual check-in (for each individual user). This paper
provides such a methodology in order to design automatic
personalized location privacy protection mechanisms.
The problem of predicting a user’s perceived utility loss
due to obfuscation is highly intertwined with the problem of
identifying why the user shares her location in the ﬁrst place. In
this paper, we propose to ﬁrst infer the motivation of the user in
sharing her location, and then to predict the utility implications
of a privacy-protection mechanism on the user’s experience
with respect to that particular motivation.2 This determines
which level of location obfuscation is acceptable to the user.
For example, a user might only want to convey the message
that she is performing a certain activity, such as “eating” in
a given city, without revealing the exact type or address of
the place where the activity is happening. In another example,
consider a user who checks in to a restaurant in Hawaii; if her
motivation is to invite some friends, then the full address of the
venue is needed, but if she wants to let her friends know she is
having a good time on vacation, then coarse grain information
about the place, e.g., “restaurant in Hawaii”, sufﬁces.
In order to ﬁnd the right balance between the level of
obfuscation and the utility requirements of each user, we use
machine learning algorithms that, given some features about a
check-in (and the user’s behavior), predict her motivation for
this check-in and her perceived utility loss for each level of
(geographical and semantic) location obfuscation. The result
of our algorithm is a personalized utility loss function. We
implement and test our methodology on the results of an online
survey involving 77 Foursquare users (with 45 check-ins per
user). We can predict the purpose of the check-ins (among 13
pre-selected purposes) with a raw correct classiﬁcation rate of
43% and the effect of obfuscation on utility (on a scale from
1 to 5) with a mean prediction error of 0.66.
The results of our survey also shed light on the effects of
location obfuscation mechanisms on the perceived utility by
users in location check-in applications. In particular, our results
indicate that semantic obfuscation (e.g., reporting “restaurant”
instead of “burger joint”) has a signiﬁcantly larger negative
impact on the perceived utility, compared to geographic ob-
fuscation (e.g., reporting the city instead of the full address).
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
1) We present
the ﬁrst methodology,
to the best of
our knowledge, for inferring the motivations behind
users’ location check-ins and their effect on users’
perceived utility loss that is caused by different levels
of location obfuscation (for both the semantic and
geographical information).
2) We design a utility loss function that can be used as a
building block for designing usable location privacy-
protection mechanisms. Such mechanisms could au-
tomatically choose the best obfuscation level
that
matches the users’ preferences in terms of utility (or
simply make suggestions and let the users choose).
3) We study the trade-off between utility and privacy in
a location-based social network, namely Foursquare,
based on the results of a survey of Foursquare users.
2Throughout the paper, we use the equivalent expressions motivation behind
and purpose of check-ins interchangeably.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After
discussing the related work in Section II, we present
the
methodology of our study in Section III, which includes an
online survey with Foursquare users, and the deﬁnition of
the motivation and utility inference framework. Subsequently,
we present quantitative results, by discussing both descriptive
statistics and performance values of our motivation classiﬁer
and utility model in Sections IV and V respectively. We then
discuss the limitations of our study, conclude the paper and
give directions for future work in Section VI.
II. RELATED WORK
From a high-level perspective, there are two broad cate-
gories of study on location-sharing behavior and privacy that
are related to our work: (i) users’ motivations for sharing
location in online social networks, and (ii) location obfuscation
techniques and their effect on perceived utility.
A. Motivations behind Location Sharing
Recently, several works investigated the users’ motiva-
tions for disclosing their locations in online social networks.
Patil et al. [27], [28] carried out two online user-studies, with
401 and 362 participants respectively, and studied the users’
motivations for sharing locations on location-based social
networks (in particular on Foursquare). The results show that
users’ main motivations include the desire to connect with their
social circles and to project an interesting image of themselves.
In particular, their motivations for sharing location information
included the desire to tell friends that they like a place, to keep
their social circle informed of where they are, to record their
visits and to appear “cool” and interesting. As a consequence,
the primary reason for “checking in” appears to be related
more to attaining a higher-level objective, such as sharing a
positive experience or to appear “cool”, rather than to pointing
to a speciﬁc geographical location. Similarly, results presented
in [12], [21] also show that social connections and impression
management play a cardinal role in users’ location-sharing
activities in Foursquare. Following these results, we adopt
the motivation labels described in [27], [28] as the default
options available to users for selecting the main purposes
of their check-ins. In order not to restrict users to one of
the predeﬁned choices, we also offer them the option for
entering a purpose that is not present in the predeﬁned list.
Cramer et al. [5] performed an in-deep qualitative study of
users’ motivations for checking in on Foursquare (e.g., reasons,
context, audience), based on interviews (N = 20) and survey
responses (N = 47). The main reasons for sharing location
that they extracted from their interview responses match the
motivation labels considered in this paper. One of their ﬁndings
is that check-ins serve a utilitarian purpose (e.g., coordinate
with friends) which shows the need for utility models (that
we provide in this paper). The authors also investigate the
importance of the audience of check-ins and the perception
of a user’s check-ins by her friends. Although related to
our work, none of the aforementioned papers tackles the
inference of the motivation behind check-ins and the design
of (motivation-based) utility models for check-ins when using
location obfuscation techniques.
B. Location Obfuscation
Location privacy is a well-studied topic in mobile networks.
Many location obfuscation mechanisms have been proposed,
including reducing the granularity of the location (general-
ization), adding noise to the geographical location, adding
fake location information, hiding location information, and
changing identiﬁers [1], [4], [11], [15], [17].
Brush et al. [3] studied the users’ preferences and concerns
for several such algorithms by visually showing the result of
each of them to the users. Although the evaluation showed
that the users understood the basic effects of the different
algorithms, the authors highlighted a signiﬁcant lack of aware-
ness of long-term threats. A related effort by Tang et al. [32]
presents the users with three different visualizations of their
past shared locations and studies their effect on the end-user
privacy. They show that, based on the type of visualization,
the users expressed diverging attitudes towards the people with
whom they shared their locations.
There are also targeted studies on the usability of the
proposed location obfuscation techniques for mobile appli-
cations [14], [23]. In particular, Micinski et al. [23] study
the relationship between location obfuscation and application
