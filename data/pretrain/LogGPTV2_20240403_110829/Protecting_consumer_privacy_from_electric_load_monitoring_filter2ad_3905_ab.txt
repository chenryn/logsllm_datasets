ance proﬁle consists of the types of appliances and the times dur-
ing which each is operational during the day. Load proﬁling tech-
niques classify devices by the changes in steady state load caused
by their being turned ON and OFF [18]. The approach is to de-
compose the load proﬁle into a composite of individual appliances
features, i.e., representative pairs of ON/OFF events. For exam-
ple, periodic spikes in energy use are visible in homes with electric
furnaces during cold weather. NILM algorithms can extract the ex-
pected furnace load from the load proﬁle to expose other, possibly
smaller, appliance loads. These techniques use appliance models
and information learned about a residence over time to reconstruct
behavior from a single aggregate signature. Such techniques have
been shown to be highly accurate in practice [25, 21, 33, 22]. We
discuss other classes of NILM that are not relevant to residential
smart meters in Section 5.3.
2.3 Energy Storage
NILL requires one of a particular class of deep-cycle batteries.
Deep cycle batteries are designed to be able to operate adequately
during long cycles of charging and discharging without signiﬁ-
cantly reducing their lifetime. Such batteries are frequently used
in recreational vehicles such as RVs and boats. There are several
types of deep cycle batteries that support highly variable load pro-
ﬁles (at short timescales) present in home energy consumption. The
Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) battery (which has a lead-acid chem-
istry) has several properties that make it ideal for home use; they
work well at extreme temperatures, have low internal resistance,
can be charged at high voltages, and are designed to prevent leak-

ity to maintain the constant load. If however, the load remains light,
eventually the battery will reach its maximum SOC. We call this a
high recovery state.
We use the model shown in Figure 3 in describing the control
system and bootstrapping phase in the next section. The model
captures both the actual load proﬁle of the house d(t), as well as
the load under the inﬂuence of NILL as perceived by the electric
meter u(t). The essence of NILL is described by the equation,
u(t) = d(t) + b(t), where b is the battery’s rate of charge over
time.

The experiments in the following section use load proﬁles col-
lected in the spring of 2010 in the four residences, as described in
Table 2. We refer to the data sets as H1, H2, A2, and T1 throughout
(homes 1 and 2, apartment 1 and townhouse 1, respectively). The
data collection process introduced a small number of sample out-
ages in which no data was collected. This was due to brief power
cycles of the TED or lost communication between the TED col-
lector and usage sensor. We repair these gaps by placing repeated
samples of the constant average of the surrounding 100 seconds.
The H1 data contained two such gaps (1 hour, 3 minutes), H2 con-
tained one gap (19 minutes), A1 contained no outages, and T1 had
2 gaps (11 minutes, 13 minutes). Given their relatively small size,
these gaps have little inﬂuence on our experimental results.
Figure 5 illustrates energy use over different time scales for one
residence, H1. The month proﬁle highlights the relatively constant
rate of use over time. Note that during the week of March 3rd, the
usage drops off substantially. The occupants left for a spring break
during this period, turned down the thermostat, and unplugged ap-
pliances throughout the house. The daily energy use exhibits sim-
ilar diurnal patters as described in Section 2.1. The periodic usage
spikes observed in the day-scale data was the result of the home’s
furnace turning ON and OFF blower motors to force heat in the

gas-heated house. Finally, the hourly readings show the enormous
sensitivity of these devices to internal use; while spikes caused by
starting dryers and heat pump blowers are very clear, small changes
caused by appliances such as lamps are also visible.
4.2 Full System Simulation
The NILL system simulation answers the question of how effec-
tively the battery and controller can remove appliance features from
a metered load proﬁle. To achieve a realistic battery model, we im-
plemented the simulation in Simulink with the SimPowerSystems
extension [26]. This was necessary, as using an oversimpliﬁed bat-
tery model, e.g. one with linear discharge characteristics, would
lead to an inaccurate assessment of NILL’s capabilities.

Bottom: The same load under the simulated NILL
system with a 50 Ah battery (u).
Our simulation is shown in Figure 6. At the heart of the system
is a circuit with three elements: a net load exerted by appliances,
a voltage source for the utility, and a battery. The appliance load
is supplied by demand data collected from the TEDs. It is injected
into the system as a real valued signal, and converted to an elec-
trical load by a variable resistor in the programmable load. (Like
several other residential NILM studies [10, 4, 22], we focus on real
power consumption.) The programmable load is supplied by the
utility and potentially the battery, which sit in parallel on the cir-
cuit. The part of the net load not supplied by the battery will be sup-
plied by the utility voltage source according to Kirchhoff’s circuit
laws. Battery charging is controlled by the switching connecting
the battery to the rest of the circuit. To avoid severe performance
slowdowns in our simulation, we implement the battery switching
using variable resistance and voltage sources in place of simulat-
ing non-linear power electronics. When the battery is discharging,
a variable resistance is used to draw current from the battery, and
a current source supplies the load proportionally. This process is
reversed during charging.
With regards to timing in the circuit, the load proﬁle data is in-
serted at the rate of one sample per second, the same rate at which
it was recorded. The metrology unit on the utility meter decimates
the signal to have 1/4 the resolution of the control unit. In reality,
control units with MHz clocks can have orders of magnitude higher
resolution than solid state metering, giving a full implementation a
greater advantage. Forcing sampling at these rates however would
have made the simulation run prohibitively slow. Finally, the mem-
ory block placed before the control serves to add a one-step delay
between the propagation of the sensor signals to the simulator, and
the propagation of the resulting control signals to the circuit.
The battery model used in the simulator was originally designed
for SimPowerSystems in [38]. It maintains only a single state vari-
able, the state of charge, as well as several other parameters to
model voltage during the two phases of battery discharge: the ex-
ponential and nominal zones. The additional parameters, including
internal resistance, are derived from the battery type, nominal volt-
age, and capacity. The model has been shown to accurately produce
the original manufacturer voltage curves for lead acid batteries, as
well as several other basic battery types.
The control unit receives two variables, the net demand and the
battery’s state of charge. Based on the control model presented in
section 3.1, these are used to calculate the charge state and rate of
charge for the target KSS. The control also checks the conditions
for entering a recovery state and adjusts KSS using EWMA. The
control system is implemented in just under 900 lines of Matlab
code.
Simulation Procedure
4.2.1
We ran the simulator on each of the four load proﬁle data sets.
The runs for H2, A1, and T1 lasted for approximately 3 hours each,
and H1 ran for 6 hours. The initial target load KSS for each sim-
ulation was calculated by running Algorithm 1 over one week of
sample data occurring prior to the load proﬁles used in the sim-
ulation. The initial KSS for each residence is shown in Table 2.
Though the initial values are not closely aligned with the longer
term run-time steady states, they err on the side of caution due to
the strict SOC constraint on line 5 of Algorithm 1. In each case,
KSS was either close to the immediate load at the beginning of the
trace, or led to a high recovery state with no leaked features. Along
with the metered power under NILL u(t), the SOC over time c(t)
was included in the output of each simulation.
The results report below were collected using a simulated 50
Ah battery with a 60 A maximum discharge. The α value for the
EWMA used to adjust KSS was calibrated experimental to 0.5.
Methods for choosing an optimal α and other parameters are cov-
ered in Section 5.2. The lower bound on charge was chosen to be
20% SOC. The initial state of the battery was set to 80% SOC.
4.3 Simulation Results
A two-week example of the load proﬁle witnessed by the elec-
tric meter (u) compared with the total load (d) is shown in Figure 7.
From this example, several things are apparent. First, there are ex-
tended periods of hours to days during which no appliance features
are visible in u. Second, the majority of features that do occur in
u have high amplitudes, and are among the largest present in d.
Third, periods of light load in d are accompanied by periods of
very light or nearly zero load in u. And ﬁnally, the emergent shape
of the load proﬁle remains the same for both d and u, and the area
under the two curves is approximately the same. We now inspect
each of these facets in detail.
Steady state loads comprise the majority of the NILL load pro-
ﬁle. During these periods, the controller is able to maintain the tar-
get steady state load KSS without depleting or fully charging the
battery. Thus, the better the choice of KSS, the longer the steady
