User: I'm trying to find the best way to switch between the two python compilers, 2.7 to 3.3.
I ran the python script from the cmd like this:

python ex1.py

Where do I set the "python" environment in the window's environment variable to point to either python 3.3 or 2.7?
I am wondering if there is an easy way to switch between the two versions from the cmd line?
Assistant: simply add both to the env variables and then you have to move the version you want to the top
