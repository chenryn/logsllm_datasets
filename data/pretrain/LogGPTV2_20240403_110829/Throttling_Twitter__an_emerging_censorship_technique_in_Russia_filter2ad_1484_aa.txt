ABSTRACT
In March 2021, the Russian government started to throttle Twitter
on a national level, marking the first ever use of large-scale, targeted
throttling for censorship purposes. The slowdown was intended
to pressure Twitter to comply with content removal requests from
the Russian government.
In this paper, we take a first look at this emerging censorship
technique. We work with local activists in Russia to detect and
measure the throttling and reverse engineer the throttler from in-
country vantage points. We find that the throttling is triggered
by Twitter domains in the TLS SNI extension, and the throttling
limits both upstream and downstream traffic to a value between
130 kbps and 150 kbps by dropping packets that exceed this rate.
We also find that the throttling devices appear to be located close
to end-users, and that the throttling behaviors are consistent across
different ISPs suggesting that they are centrally coordinated. No-
tably, this deployment marks a departure from Russia’s previously
decentralized model to a more centralized one that gives significant
power to the authority to impose desired restrictions unilaterally.
Russia’s throttling of Twitter serves as a wake-up call to censorship
researchers, and we hope to encourage future work in detecting
and circumventing this emerging censorship technique.

1 INTRODUCTION
Traditional Internet censorship relies on targeted blocking of con-
tent and resources. Censors implement blocking using network
traffic features such as IP [8, 12, 13], DNS [6, 16, 30, 37], key-
words [15, 36, 57], or protocol fingerprints [3, 7, 11, 56]. In ex-
treme cases, censors have also used Internet shutdowns to com-
pletely sever connection to the Internet to prevent unwanted ac-
cess [21, 22, 49].
While blocking is a common tool for censors, less has been
observed about throttling connections as a means for censorship.
In contrast to blocking, throttling aims to degrade bandwidth to a
service to discourage its use while still allowing some access. This
offers an attractive technique for censors as it is more difficult for
users and circumventors to detect or attribute the slowdown to
censorship: slow connections may be a natural result of network
congestion and not intentional throttling.
In March 2021 the Russian government started throttling Twitter
on a national scale [34], in an attempt to pressure Twitter to com-
ply with Russian content removal requests [42]. While throttling
an entire user Internet connection near political events has been
observed before such as in Iran in 2013 [55], Russia’s slowdown of
Twitter marks the first instance of a country selectively throttling
specific domains and services on demand as an emerging new cen-
sorship technique. Under pressure, Twitter fulfilled the majority
of content takedown requests to comply with the Russian govern-
ment’s order without providing any transparency to its users. In
May 2021 Russia threatened to use the same throttling technique
against Google in response to disputes over anti-government con-
tent on YouTube [40].
In this paper, we investigate and document the Russian throttling
of Twitter in depth. Hours after the onset of the throttling we started
conducting measurements using multiple in-country vantage points
to investigate the behavior of the throttling and how it changes
over time. In addition, we use public crowdsourced data covering
401 unique Russian ASes to measure how widely the throttling
impacted Internet users in Russia.
Our findings show that the throttling is triggered upon observ-
ing Twitter-related domains (*.twimg.com, twitter.com, t.co) in
the SNI (Server Name Indication) extension of a TLS Client Hello
record. The throttling is not symmetric and can only be triggered
for TCP connections that originate from within Russia. However,
once such a connection is established, throttling can be triggered by
a Twitter SNI sent in either direction. Moreover, we observe that the
throttling devices inspect beyond the first packet in a connection

(where typically the SNI-containing Client Hello message would
appear), possibly as a countermeasure to circumvention attempts.
Once the throttler is triggered, data packets transferred in either
direction (download/upload) will be dropped once the rate limit
(around 130 kbps to 150 kbps) is reached. We also perform TTL-
limited measurements and determine that the throttling devices
are placed close to end-users but are not co-located with the ISP
devices performing blocking, suggesting they may be separate from
existing blocking infrastructure. Finally, we find that the throttling
behaviors are largely consistent across different ISPs, suggesting
that the throttling devices are likely centrally coordinated.
Based on our measurements of the throttling mechanism, we
make several recommendations on how to circumvent the throt-
tling, such as TCP-level fragmentation or TLS packet stuffing. We
also recommend that browsers and websites implement efforts to
support TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) to make it more difficult
for censors to throttle based on SNI.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study and
analyze targeted throttling at a national scale. We anticipate that
governments’ next-generation censorship techniques will target
degrading quality of service of sensitive domains in similar ways,
making this an important problem to study, especially since current
censorship detection platforms [33, 35, 50] focus on blocking and
are not yet equipped to monitor throttling. We hope our work en-
courages future work in detecting and circumventing this emerging
censorship technique.
2 BACKGROUND
Traffic throttling: Throttling is an intentional act by an ISP or
other network intermediary to reduce the bandwidth allocated to
network traffic. There are two common ways to implement throt-
tling: traffic shaping, which delays packets exceeding an assigned
rate limit, and traffic policing, which drops the exceeding packets
instead [9]. Throttling can be either targeted, applied to only a se-
lect set of protocols or users, or indiscriminate, applied to all traffic
regardless.
There is a limited literature that studied traffic throttling. Kakhki
et al. designed an app that uses a “Record-and-Replay” method to
detect throttling for arbitrary applications on mobile networks [23].
Flach et al. developed heuristics to quantify traffic policing from
server-side traces [17]. Furthermore, Li et al. developed a method-
ology and a tool to identify traffic classification rules that trigger
throttling from middleboxes [26, 28]. Their analysis revealed 30
ISPs in 7 countries that deployed traffic throttling mechanisms [27].
While there are instances of ISPs offering different performance
for different users or services [10, 27, 59], throttling used for cen-
sorship is largely unprecedented. One exception is the nation-
wide Internet slowdowns in Iran during periods of political up-
heavals [4, 14, 55], but those events were not targeted but instead
applied to all traffic. In this paper, we investigate the first ever use
of large-scale, targeted throttling for censorship purposes.
Changes in Russia’s Censorship Model: Russia’s network architec-
ture consists of thousands of ASes and a large number of ISPs, which
is similar to many other countries around the world. As shown
by Ramesh et al., unlike China and Iran, Russia uses a decentral-
ized information control mechanism with different ISPs implement
censorship differently, hence contributing to the fragmentation of
access to online content for users in Russia [39].
Specifically Ramesh et al. showed that each ISP is responsible
for the DPI (deep packet inspection) systems under their control.
Roskomnadzor (Russia’s authority on information control) pro-
vides a list of blocked resources, over 100k domains and IPs, to be
downloaded and used by each ISP’s DPI system. Many ISPs use
commercially available hardware solutions, but some used open
source filtering software or implemented their their own.
However, as we show in this paper, the behaviors of the throttlers
show a high degree of coordination across different ISPs. This marks
a departure from the decentralized model, which suggests that
Roskomnadzor is successfully moving towards centralized control
on its decentralized network of thousands of ISPs.
3 ETHICS
Measuring censorship events raises important ethical considera-
tions that require due diligence from researchers to protect any
human subjects involved. Most such studies, including ours, mea-
sure censorship policies by actively triggering the censors and
observing their responses, which may put participants at risk. We
carefully designed our measurements to follow best practices de-
scribed in Menlo [32] reports and we were guided by several ethical
considerations from previous works [39, 52].

Russian AS level
We use two primary data sources: 1) measurements conducted
from our own in-country vantage points in Russia due to asym-
metric nature of throttling (see § 6.5) and 2) crowd-sourced dataset
of the throttling. Before performing any measurements, we care-
fully discuss the details of our tests and only proceed after getting
consent from the owner of the vantage point. We are not aware
of anyone who has been arrested or fined by the government for
performing this type of measurement, and we ourselves have per-
formed this kind of research in prior work and are aware of the
risks.
With respect to the usage of the public, crowd-sourced mea-
surement dataset (see § 4), we reached out to our US institution’s
IRB and we obtained an official determination from the IRB as Not
Regulated. Nonetheless, we make sure that the data was collected
ethically. The website measures and compares client’s bandwidth
to Twitter and to a control site by sending requests and timing the
downloads and was set up by one of the authors. Note that access-
ing Twitter was permitted in Russia even while it was throttled. In
addition, before starting any measurement, this website informs
the users about the description of the tests, the data collected, and
links to open-sourced code. It also explicitly states that it collects
timestamps, speeds for each test case, IP (anonymized to subnet),
Autonomous System Number, and ISP information. All data was
bucketed into 5-min bins before being made public in order to
eliminate any time correlation.
4 THROTTLING TWITTER INCIDENT
On March 10 2021, Roskomnadzor announced that the government
had “taken measures to protect Russian citizens from the influ-
ence of unlawful content” and began throttling Twitter due to its
non-compliance with Russian content takedown requests [42]. Ac-
cording to the statement, the throttling of Twitter was implemented
on 100% of mobile services and 50% of landline services. On April 5
2021, Roskomnadzor gave an ultimatum to Twitter to fulfill their
requirements by May 15 to avoid being completely blocked [44].
Under pressure, Twitter removed 91% of the requested prohibited
content and, as a result, throttling was lifted on landlines on May
17, while it remains throttled on mobile services [45, 46] at the time
of submission. Figure 1 shows a timeline of the throttling incident.
A more extensive record can be found in Appendix A.1.
Figure 3: Record and Replay measurement setup
The first reports about the throttling came from Russian activists
on ntc.party, a forum for network censorship. Consequently, a
website was set up to collect crowd-sourced measurements from
users by fetching an image hosted on Twitter and non-Twitter do-
mains and comparing the performance [53]. The dataset is publicly
available at [5].
Analyzing this data, we find that the throttling of Twitter in
Russia is widespread. Figure 2 shows fractions of requests throttled
at the AS level. From March 11 to May 19, the website recorded
34,016 measurements from 401 unique Russian ASes that show
large slowdowns in speeds for the Twitter requests.
Anecdotal reports from the Russian Internet freedom commu-
nity suggest that the throttling is being implemented with so-called
TSPU (технические средства противодействия угрозам techni-
cal solution for threat countermeasures). As later confirmed by a
government official, TSPU is a deep packet inspection (DPI) boxes
specifically developed by RDP.RU on Roskomnadzor’s orders [1, 51].
Unlike existing middleboxes used for filtering by individual ISPs,
TSPU devices are “with in the framework of centralized control”,
i.e. they are directly controlled by Roskomnadzor [43].
While the incident gained public and media attention, the imple-
mentation details and devices behind the throttling still remained
a blackbox for the community. Several questions remained unan-
swered: How is the throttling implemented? Where in the net-
work does the throttling occur? What exactly triggers the throt-
tling? How can the throttling be circumvented? Is the throttling
stable/consistent over time?
5 MEASUREMENT SETUP
Working extensively with the local Internet freedom community,
we secured eight local vantage points as listed in Table 1. By com-
paring the available bandwidth to Twitter domains with random,
non-Twitter domains, we established that seven of them experi-
enced throttling at the time. The un-throttled vantage point served
as control for our measurements. Next, we set up our vantage points
to follow the “record and replay” approach introduced by Kakhki
et al. [23] to reverse engineer how the throttler works. This tech-
nique works by recording an un-throttled connection and using a
vantage point in the tested network to replay the recorded tran-
script in order to infer if throttling is triggered in that network.
