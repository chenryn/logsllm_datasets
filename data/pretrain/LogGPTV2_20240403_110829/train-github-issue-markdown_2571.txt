`x.numpy()`
clearly means I want to convert something to numpy, which is always on the
CPU. It is redundant to have to say .cpu().numpy(). The conversion should be
automatic rather than throwing an exception.
In my specific case I have set default tensor type to CUDA because that is
what I am using by default - and because it makes it really easy to switch
everything to CPU in one line of code without cluttering up the rest of it
with passing a device around. However when I call third party software they
create a tensor without an explicit type; then try to numpy() it expecting it
to be CPU based. I have suggested they add a .cpu() but would be better to fix
in pytorch.
