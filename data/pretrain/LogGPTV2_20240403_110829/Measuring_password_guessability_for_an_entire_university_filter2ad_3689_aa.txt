## Abstract
Despite extensive research on passwords, empirical studies have been limited by the lack of access to plaintext passwords, small datasets, and password sets collected specifically for research or from low-value accounts. This study addresses these limitations by analyzing the single-sign-on passwords used by over 20,000 faculty, staff, and students at a research university with a stringent password policy. Our contributions include a secure methodology for data collection, an analysis of password guessability using state-of-the-art cracking algorithms, and the identification of significant correlations between demographic and behavioral factors and password strength. We also compare our findings with previously collected password sets, providing insights into the generalizability of existing research.

## 1. Introduction
Text-based passwords have been a subject of extensive research for decades, with numerous documented issues such as ease of guessing, difficulty in remembering, and vulnerability to various attacks. Despite the development of alternative authentication methods, text passwords remain the dominant mechanism for user authentication. Understanding the characteristics and usage of text passwords is therefore crucial.

Previous studies have faced challenges due to limited access to realistic data. Common limitations include small sample sizes, data from experimental settings rather than real-world systems, lack of plaintext passwords, self-reported information, and leaked data from low-value accounts. These limitations have left open the question of whether findings from such studies apply to high-value, frequently used passwords.

In this paper, we analyze more than 25,000 passwords from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). These passwords are the primary gatekeeper to most online functions within the university, including email, grading systems, financial data, health records, and course content. The passwords were created under a strict composition policy requiring a minimum of eight characters and four different character classes. Using indirect access to plaintext passwords, we measure their strength and correlate it with demographic and behavioral factors. Our approach provides a blueprint for future research involving sensitive security data.

## 2. Related Work
### 2.1 Password Corpora
Acquiring high-quality password corpora for analysis is challenging due to the sensitive nature of passwords. Previous studies have used various types of datasets, each with its own limitations:

- **Leaked Passwords:** Large datasets from security breaches, but lacking contextual information and often biased towards more guessable passwords.
- **Encrypted/Hashed Passwords:** Researchers obtain hashed password files with permission and attempt to crack them, again biased towards more guessable passwords.
- **Lab Studies:** Controlled experiments with small, targeted populations or larger online studies, but not representative of real-world, high-value accounts.
- **Self-Reported Data:** Useful for context but not always reliable, especially for sensitive topics like passwords.
- **Authentic Data from Large Organizations:** Limited to very large, reliable samples but with restricted access to password content.

Our study overcomes many of these limitations by analyzing a large, real-world dataset of high-value passwords with extensive contextual information.

### 2.2 Password Cracking and Strength Metrics
Accurately measuring password strength is essential for improving security. Traditional metrics like information entropy may not fully capture resistance to intelligent guessing attacks. More recent approaches, such as password guessability, model the knowledge and behavior of real-world adversaries. We use a state-of-the-art cracking algorithm to simulate guessing attacks and measure password strength.

## 3. Data Collection
### 3.1 University Data
We study the passwords used by all faculty, staff, and students at CMU, which are part of a single-sign-on system. The password composition policy requires at least one each of upper- and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols, and forbids dictionary words. We collect data from web logs, personnel databases, a survey, and the plaintext passwords themselves.

### 3.2 Working with Real Data Securely
To access this sensitive data, we negotiated a process vetted by the IRB and information security office. Plaintext passwords were made indirectly available through a legacy credential management system. All analysis software was rigorously reviewed and run on a physically and digitally isolated computer by trusted information security personnel. Users were identified only by a cryptographic hash of their user ID, and no direct access to passwords or individual account data was provided. After final analysis, the source data was securely destroyed.

This approach ensured the security of the data while allowing us to perform meaningful analyses, though it presented some challenges for exploratory data analysis and required careful planning and automation.

## 4. Analysis and Results
### 4.1 Password Strength and Demographic Factors
We find significant correlations between password strength and various demographic and behavioral factors. For example, users associated with the computer science school create passwords that are more than 1.8 times stronger than those of users associated with the business school. Stronger passwords are also correlated with a higher rate of failed login attempts due to password errors. Additionally, users who express annoyance with the complex password policy tend to create weaker passwords.

### 4.2 Comparison with Other Password Sets
We compare our real, high-value password data with password sets commonly used in research, including simulated sets, online studies, and leaked passwords from low-value accounts. Simulated password sets designed to mirror real authentication conditions provide reasonably accurate substitutes for high-value passwords, while leaked passwords vary widely in their effectiveness. This has important implications for future password research, suggesting that simulated sets may be a better choice than leaked sets.

## 5. Conclusion
This study provides a unique understanding of frequently used, high-value passwords and offers insights for improving future password research. By analyzing a large, real-world dataset with extensive contextual information, we identify significant trends in password strength and demonstrate the importance of considering demographic and behavioral factors. Our approach also provides a secure and ethical framework for working with sensitive security data.
