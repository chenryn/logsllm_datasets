3.2. Utility of State-Entry Probability
Hence we let 1) mj denote the deterministic sojourn time
of 8j , 2) Pjk denote the probability of the state-transition
from 8j to 8k, and 3) TId and TIg denote the subsets of state
space TI (such that TId U TIg == TI) for the states that have
deterministic and geometrically distributed sojourn times,
respectively. We can then derive the general recurrence re(cid:173)
lation for a state-entry probability as follows:
3.2.1 Deriving State-Occupancy Probability
As shown below, the notion of state-entry probability allows
a state-occupancy probability to have a simple expression.

impulses be collected from point n, n < i, at which M
enters 8j , up to i at which M enters 8k. Accordingly, we
have the following recurrence relation for Wk [i]:

Proof. When the destination state 8 k has a deterministic
sojourn time, the different values of n mean that M enters
8k at different points in the range of [(i - mk) + 1, i]. Thus,
the paths to 8 k that are covered by the recurrence relation
are mutually exclusive. Furthermore, the lower-bound of
the summation, namely (i - mk) + 1, ensures that the path
coverage is exhaustive. The reason is that a smaller index
value will make M depart from 8k by cycle i.
For the case in which the sojourn time of 8k has a geo(cid:173)
metric distribution, the value range of n, [0, i], clearly guar-
antees that the expression E~=o Pkk i-n Pk[n] exhaustively
enumerates those mutually exclusive paths through which
M will reside in 8k in cycle i.

3.2.2 Formulating Expected Accumulated Reward
In order to compute expected accumulated reward, we de(cid:173)
fine the following notation:
Wk [i] : A recurrence relation that yields a value equal to
the product of the probability that M will enter
8k at cycle i and the expected value of the reward
accumulated up to the end of cycle i conditioned
to M entering 8k at cycle i.
Wk[i]: A recurrence relation that yields a value equal to
the product of the probability that M will be in
8k at cycle i and the expected value of the reward
accumulated up to the end of cycle i conditioned
to M being in 8k at cycle i.
Our objective is to derive recurrence relations to solve
the expected reward accumulated through a mission-task
period T which is quantified in number of cycles. Letting
this performability measure be denoted as W[T], then by
the theorem of total expectation [9], we have
W[T] = LWk[T].
kErr
The derivation of the recurrence relation for Wk[i] re(cid:173)
sembles that for Pk [i] in the sense that we divide the ori(cid:173)
gin states (that are involved in the transition to the desti(cid:173)
nation state 8 k) into two categories, namely those having
deterministic sojourn times and those having geometrically
distributed sojourn times. Nonetheless the formulation of
Wk [i] must ensure that reward impulse(s) will be appropri(cid:173)
ately accrued at each point of state transition.
By definition, i must be the point for the occurrence of
the transition 8 j ~ 8 k ,j E II - {k}. Hence we let reward
jErrg -{k} n=O
(3)
where mj is the deterministic sojourn time for 8j , and Wj is
the magnitude of the reward impulse accrued in each cycle
in which M stays in 8j •
Proof. We first show the correctness of the first term of Eq.
(3), which is the expression for the case in which the ori(cid:173)
gin state of a transition to 8k has a deterministic sojourn
time. Note that mjwj is the reward accrued from the point
(i - mj) to point i, given that M enters 8 j at i - mj and
enters 8k from 8 j at i. Then Pj[i - mj]mjwj is the ex(cid:173)
pected value of the reward accrued from i - mj to i. Then,
Wj[i - mj] + Pj[i - mj]mjwj is the expected value of
the reward accrued from 0 to i, given that the transition
8 j ~ 8k occurs at i. It follows that the expected value of
the reward accumulated from 0 to i at which M enters 8k
from Sj equalspjk (Wj[i - mjJ + Pj[i - mjJmjwj). So
when we sum up the above result over j, j E IId - {k}, we
exhaustively take into account the mutually exclusive paths
that lead M to enter 8k at i for the case in which the transi(cid:173)
tion's origin state 8 j has a deterministic sojourn time. In a
similar manner, we can prove the correctness of the second
term ofEq. (3).
Q.E.D.
To this end we can derive Wk[i] in terms of Wk[i] and
Pk [i] as follows:
i
L
(Wk[n] + A[n](i-n)wk)
n=(i-mk)+1
if 8k has a deterministic sojourn time
n (Wk[nJ + A[n](i - n)Wk)
-
i
LPkk i
n=O
otherwise
(4)
Proof. We first discuss the case in which 8 k has a deter(cid:173)
ministic sojourn time. By definition, Wk [n] is the expected
value of reward accrued up to cycle n in which M enters
8k. Further, (i - n)Wk is the additional reward accumulated
since cycle n up to cycle i, given that M enters 8k in cycle
n. Then Pk [n] (i - n)Wk is the expected value of the addi(cid:173)
tional reward accrued from the state-entry point n to point i.
It follows that Wk[n]+Pk[n](i-n) Wk is the expected value
of the reward accumulated from 0, through n at which M
enters 8k , up to i at which M remains in 8k • But because
8k has a deterministic sojourn time mk, the elapsed time
since cycle n at which M enters 8 k must be shorter than

mk; otherwise, M will depart from Sk by cycle i. There(cid:173)
fore the lower and upper bounds of the summation, namely
(i - mk) + 1 and i, respectively, ensure that the summation
terms together exhaustively cover all the mutually exclusive
paths with which M will remain in Sk in cycle i.
For the case in which the sojourn time of Sk is geomet-
rically distributed, Wk [n] + Pk[n] (i - n) Wk is clearly the
expected value of the reward accumulated from 0, through
n at which M enters Sk, up to i, given that M remains
n (Wk[nJ + A[n](i - n) Wk)
in Sk in cycle i. Then Pkk i
is the expected value of the reward accumulated up to i at
which M resides in Sk.
-
Finally, the summation with the lower and upper bounds
of n, namely zero and i, respectively, ensures that the ex(cid:173)
pected values of the accumulated reward that results from
the mutually exclusive paths (through which M enters Sk
in cycle n, n E {O, 1, ... ,i}, and remains in Sk in cycle i)
are exhaustively taken into account.

3.2.3 Beyond Basic DTSMP: Periodic Events
Thus far we have derived general formulas for state-entry
and state-occupancy probabilities and expressions concern(cid:173)
ing accumulated reward for basic DTSMPs. Nonetheless,
the occurrences of some events in embedded systems are
periodic and driven by a countdown timer. Furthermore,
such a timer is usually reset upon the completion of the pe(cid:173)
riodic event driven by the timer or upon the completion of
another related event in the system, resulting in nonstation(cid:173)
ary transition probabilities.
In this section, we discuss some concepts concern(cid:173)
ing such periodic events. Further, we show how state(cid:173)
entry probabilities enable us to solve a model
in(cid:173)
volves nonstationary transition probabilities associated with
timers. We begin by introducing the term mixed geometric(cid:173)
deterministic sojourn-time distribution:
that
Definition 2 A "mixed geometric-deterministic sojourn(cid:173)
time distribution" (MGDD) is a distribution in which the
sojourn time of a state is geometrically distributed and is
bounded above by a value L.
This definition then enables us to define a simple timer:
Definition 3.A "simple timer" is a timer that governs a pe(cid:173)
riodic event Sj ~ Si in a DrSMP; the sojourn-time distri(cid:173)
bution of Sj is an MGDD that is characterized by an upper
bound L such that when 1 < L (in which 1 is the elapsed
time since M enters Sj),
but when 1= L,
Pjk = { ~
ifk = j
otherwise
Pjk = { ~
ifk = i
otherwise
where i E II - {j}.
Accordingly, Si represents a strictly periodic event (with
a period L) which M undergoes via the transition Sj ~ Si.
Indeed, if we add a simple timer to a basic DTSMP, it will
remain a basic DTSMP, since a simple timer is defined upon
a special case of MGDD for which the upper bound of the
sojourn time of Sj can be translated into a deterministic so(cid:173)
journ time for that state (so that in the resulting model each
state has either a geometrically distributed or a determinis(cid:173)
tic sojourn time). On the other hand, the notion of a simple
timer is inadequate for modeling periodic events that are
more sophisticated. For example, a simple timer will not
allow us to model a conditional periodic event. Hence we
introduce the concept of generalized timer below.
Definition 4 A "generalized timer" is a timer that governs
a periodic event Sj ~ Si in a DrSMP; the sojourn-time
distribution of Sj is an MGDD that is characterized by an
upper bound L such that when 1 < L (in which 1 is the
elapsed time since M enters Sj),

Note that Definitions 3 and 4 both imply that a timer is reset
and starts countdown upon M's return to the state (Sj) via
which M underwent a particular periodic event (Si) upon
timer expiration. Moreover, together with the definition of
MGDD, Definitions 3 and 4 imply that a timer will be de(cid:173)
activated upon M's departure from Sj, as the upper bound
of the sojourn time of Sj is specified with respect to a con(cid:173)
tinuous occupancy of Sj. Further, since in a DTSMP, M
occupies one and only one state at a time, at any point there
will exist at most one activated timer in a DTSMP.
The example illustrated in Figure 2 involves a general(cid:173)
ized timer that drives a periodic event So ~ S1. More
specifically, the timer is reset to L every time the system en(cid:173)
ters So (from Sl or S2) whose sojourn time has an MGDD.
Prior to timer expiration, Pal = °while poo and P02 are
in (0,1) such that Poo + P02 = 1. Upon timer expiration,
POO becomes 0, whereas the value of P02 remains the same.
Thus POI = POO such that POI = 1 - P02, implying that the
system will undergo the periodic event given that So ~ S2
does not happen.
Such a conditional periodic event can be interpreted as
follows. A preventive maintenance (Sl) is conducted peri(cid:173)
odically while the system is in a normal-performance state

(80 ), Meanwhile, an unscheduled corrective maintenance
(82) will override the preventive-maintenance schedule if
an error is detected in the system. Then, the point at which
a maintenance (of either type) completes will mark an epoch
for the interval L preceding the next preventive maintenance
event. Moreover, we note that internal-state changes that
are not covered by monitoring mechanisms and that do not
result in appreciable damage to the system are often trans(cid:173)
parent to the application. This suggests that when a system
is in a state subset that represents a series of performance
degradations, a scheduled maintenance will occur as usual
until the extent of the degradation becomes excessive (e.g.,
resulting in an exception or failure). Therefore, in order
to build and solve RRB models for systems involving more
sophisticated periodic events, we define the notion of degra(cid:173)
dation (or progress) sequence below.
Definition 5 A "degradation (or progress) sequence" is an
ordered random sequence that is formed by a state subset
J = {jk IkE {O,'" , 1JI -
I}} where the sojourn time
of each state j k has a geometric distribution such that the
value of Pjkjk' is in (0,1) if k' - k E {O, I} and is zero
otherwise.
Suppose a timer is reset every time M enters 8jo ' Then,
while M experiences successive internal-state changes, the
timer countdown will continue; upon timer expiration, M
will go from state jk (in which M resides when the timer
expires) to a periodic event. In tum, that suggests to us the
concept of a collective sojourn time:
Definition 6 A "collective sojourn time" ljn is the accumu(cid:173)
lated time during which M continuously stays in a degra(cid:173)
dation sequence with a state subset J, via the path 8· ~
8j1 ~ ... ~ 8 jn - 1
~ 8 jn , where n ~ IJI - 1.
Jo
Coupled with Definition 5, Definition 6 yields the fol(cid:173)
lowing theorem:
Theorem 3 If a degradation sequence with a state subset
J has an upper bound L J on its collective sojourn time,
then the sojourn-time distribution of each state in J is an
MGDD.
Proof. Per Definition 5, the sojourn time of each state in
a degradation sequence is geometrically distributed. Since
the collective sojourn time for the degradation sequence is
bounded above by LJ, the sojourn time of 8jk , jk E J, will
have an upper bound LJ -lk-l, where the value of lk-l is
in (0, LJ) if k ~ 1 and is zero otherwise.
