means that a DNS operator supports DNSSEC and ✗ means that a DNS operator fails to support DNSSEC. If DNS operators support
uploading a DS record via web interface, we do not email them to ask if they accept a DS record by email (hence –). Only three them
support DNSSEC for domains they manage, and only one of them provides DNSSEC by default for these domains (NameCheap
only supports DNSSEC by default for certain plans, hence the ▲ [33]). Only 11 of the registrars support DNSSEC for external
nameservers, eight providing web-based forms for uploading DS records and three requiring emails with DS records; only two of these
actually validate the provided DS records. Of the three that require emails, two of them do not verify the validity of the incoming
email (hence the ▲).

(3) If we manage to enable DNSSEC, we verify that the registrar
correctly deploys all DNSSEC records by checking the exis-
tence of a DS record, its accordance with our DNSKEY, and the
validity of the RRSIGs.
(4) We then disable the registrar hosting, and switch our domain
to use an external nameserver we control. Our nameserver
correctly publishes all DNSSEC records.
(5) Next, we examine whether the registrar allows us to upload a
DS record via the web interface. If we are unable to find this
feature, we email the registrar to ask whether we can provide
a DS record some other way.
(6) If we are able to supply a DS record, we verify that our domain
correctly deploys all DNSSEC records.
(7) Next, if possible, we upload a DS record that does not match
our published DNSKEY, to check if the registrar validates sup-
plied DS records.
(8) Finally, if a registrar accepts a DS record via e-mail, we send
it with a different email address (one that was not used to
register the domain) to see whether they check that the owner
of the domain is sending the record.
Table 2 summarizes the results of this experiment. We make a num-
ber of observations below.
5.2 Registrar as a DNS operator
We first focus on what happens when we use the registrar as the
DNS operator for our domain. Surprisingly, only three registrars
(GoDaddy, NameCheap, and OVH) out of the 20 we studied support
DNSSEC at all when they are the DNS operator. This situation
is unfortunate, as these cases present an easy path to DNSSEC
deployment, as the registrar has full control over the domain and
could create DNSKEYs, RRSIGs, and upload DS records all on its own.
Even more alarming, among the three registrars that do sup-
port DNSSEC when they are the DNS operator, we find that only
NameCheap enables DNSSEC by default, and they only do so for
some of their DNS plans. In particular, NameCheap offers six differ-
ent plans, only three of which support DNSSEC [33]. NameCheap’s
free plan, FreeDNS, does not support DNSSEC, partially explaining
the low fraction of signed domains. The other two registrars that
12DNSSEC was only available to Google Clould DNS customers
participating in Alpha release [21].
13The nameservers from 1AND1 Internet (also hosting provider)
share the same second level domain, but are dispersed over the
different ccTLDs; we instead group them easily when the second
level of NS record is “1and1.”
14Wix does not allow an owner to use external nameservers.
15The nameservers from Amazon Web Services have a specific
naming convention; awsdns-id.TLD (e.g., awsdns-13.net), which
allows grouping them by using a regular expression.

T. Chung et al.
support DNSSEC also have different policies: GoDaddy provides
DNSSEC as a premium package (at a cost of $35 per year), while
OVH provides DNSSEC for free but only if the customer explicitly
opts in.
From our December 31st, 2016 snapshot, we observe that 25.9%
of domains from OVH, 0.59% of domains from NameCheap, and
0.02% of domains from GoDaddy deploy DNSSEC. As seen in
Figure 4, to further explore the behavior of customers with these
registrars, we compare the historic fraction of OVH and GoDaddy
domains that have DNSKEYs and DS records.Unsurprisingly, we ob-
serve that OVH’s overall DNSSEC adoption ratio is significantly
higher and growing. However, GoDaddy’s fraction of DNSSEC-
support domains is minuscule by comparison: only 7,841 of their
domains (0.02%) domains have a DNSKEY and DS record in our latest
snapshot. Thus, we can immediately see the crucial role that free
and default support for DNSSEC can have in successfully deploying
DNSSEC.
We contacted an administrator of one of the registrars to inquire
why they choose to make DNSSEC an opt-in feature rather than a
default, and why DNSSEC adoption was still low. They reported
three potential reasons: (1) the layout of their purchase page, which
placed the (free) option for DNSSEC on the same page as other
(paid) options; (2) misconceptions concerning DNSSEC among
their customers, who believe that DNSSEC causes issues for domain
name resolution for non-DNSSEC supporting clients; and (3) DNS
resolution performance, where requests for records in domains that
support DNSSEC may take longer to resolve.
5.3 Owner as a DNS operator
Next, we explore how registrars support DNSSEC if the owner acts
as the DNS operator (e.g., by hosting their own nameserver). We find
that only 11 of the 20 registrars listed in Table 2 support DNSSEC for
such domains (beyond the three discussed above, this includes eNom,
HostGator, NameBright, DreamHost, Amazon, Google, 123-Reg,
and Rightside).
Interestingly, only three registrars in this group of twenty (Ama-
zon, Google, and Rightside) present a DS upload menu on their site
when a user switches to an external nameserver. 123-reg requires
customers to submit a support ticket to upload DS records, and they
must attach the desired DS record to the ticket. Similarly, HostGator’s
customers need to have a live web chat with an agent to copy/paste
the DS record into the chat window. While all of 123-reg’s and Host-
Gator’s webpages are HTTPS-secured—at least ensuring that the DS
record is uploaded through a secure channel—these approaches are
manual processes that present numerous opportunities for error.16
The remaining registrars do not provide any details on their web-
pages for users who want to enable DNSSEC on domains operated
by a third party. We contacted each registrar to ask whether they sup-
port DNSSEC in this case, and if so, how we can send the DS record
to them. We find that three of these are willing to support DNSSEC,
16As an anecdotal example, we found that one of our DS records
was accidentally installed by the registrar on someone else’s domain
due to a mistake by the customer service agent with whom we were
chatting. This mistake was fixed right after we raised the issue, but
potentially made the other domain inaccessible to DNSSEC-aware
clients while the DS record was present.
and all of them require that the DS record be submitted via email.
These case studies are particularly disappointing, as communicating
DS records over email opens up security vulnerabilities due to the
insecurity of email communication17.
DS record validation We now turn our attention to see how these
registrars validate DS records once they have been uploaded. As
the DS record is a core piece of the trust chain, the uploading pro-
cess must be carefully considered. If a domain owner uploads an
incorrect DS record by mistake (e.g., the wrong record, or an incor-
rectly formatted record), the domain will fail to validate, potentially
preventing clients from communicating with the domain.
We first check whether the registrars validate the uploaded DS
record to ensure it is the hash of the domain’s DNSKEY. We observe
that only two registrars (OVH and DreamHost) out of the 11 reg-
istrars that support DNSSEC when the owner is the DNS operator
correctly validated the DS record before accepting it. Interestingly,
Amazon allows domain owners to upload their DNSKEY instead of
the DS record (and generates the DS record by themselves), which is
not perfect, as a domain owner could upload a different DNSKEY than
the one that they are actually serving. The remaining registrars all
allow us to publish arbitrary data as DS records.
Finally, we tested whether the registrars that require emailed DS
records would accept an updated DS record without validating the
email (as email headers can be forged). We found that two of the
three registrars that require emailed DS records did not attempt to
verify the authenticity of the email, meaning an attacker who wished
to take control of a victim domain could simply forge an email to
these registrars. We have contacted these two registrars to inform
them of this security vulnerability.
5.4 Summary
In summary, we observe that DNSSEC support is quite poor among
the popular registrars: only three of 20 registrars support DNSSEC
for registrar-hosted domains, and only 11 of them support DNSSEC
for externally hosted domains. Of the three that do support DNSSEC
for registrar-hosted domains, only one is by default and even that
is only for certain plans; one of the other two even charges domain
owners for the service. Finally, we observe that only two providers
reject a DS record that does not match the DNSKEY served from the
external nameservers. The others, however, accept anything as a
DS record so that a simple copy/paste error could make the entire
zone fail to validate (and thus fail to resolve) by DNSSEC-validating
resolvers.
6 DNSSEC-SUPPORTING REGISTRARS
Measuring the most popular registrars, as we did above, provides an
overall view of support for DNSSEC. To better understand how
registrars that do support DNSSEC behave, we now repeat the
same experiment as above but focus on the registrars that have
the largest number of domains with DNSKEYs. Specifically, we first
extract .com, .net, and .org second-level domains that publish at
least one DNSKEY record from our latest snapshot (December 31st,
2016). Next, we group them by registrars as we did before. We then
17Ironically, deploying DNSSEC correctly can improve email
security using STARTTLS [? ] and DANE [41].
