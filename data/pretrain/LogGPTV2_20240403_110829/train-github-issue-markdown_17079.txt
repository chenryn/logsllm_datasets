`console.log(router)` shows correct asPath but If I access
`console.log(router.asPath)` shows the previous URL
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Code (`_app.js`)
    export default class MyApp extends App {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)
      }
      static async getInitialProps({ Component, router, ctx }) {
        // Router.asPath shows current URL, can be seen from browser console as below
        console.log(router)
        // But if i access the asPath property as below, it shows previous URL. On server side, it's fine
        console.log(router.asPath)
      }
      ...
    }
## Expected Behavior
Refer to above code, `router.asPath` should return current URL on client side
## Current Behavior
Refer to above code, `router.asPath` returns previous URL on client side
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Please refer to above code example.
## Context
After url is deprecated, we pass URL from `_app.js`, as all pages need this
for some sort of SEO related stuffs.
as a workaround using `ctx.asPath` for now
