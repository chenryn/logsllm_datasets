User: Please explain what cloud computing, cloud services and cloud deployment are and provide use cases in the real world.
Assistant: Cloud computing refers to the provision of computing resources (including computing power, storage and network) to users through cloud computing technology, so that users can flexibly use computing resources according to their needs without owning these resources themselves. Cloud computing can be divided into three types: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS). Cloud service is a service provided on the basis of cloud computing, which can be directly used by users. These services include storage, data backup, virtual machines and applications, and more. Cloud deployment refers to the deployment of an application or service into a cloud environment so that it can run on the cloud platform. This deployment enables companies to scale their business and support needs at any time without purchasing hardware or software. A classic example is Netflix. Netflix is a company that provides online streaming services. They need to store a large number of high-definition videos and provide instant streaming services. In response to these needs, they chose to use the AWS cloud computing platform to be able to scale their business and support needs at any time. They use cloud services for storage and backup, and complete application deployment on the cloud. In this way, Netflix does not need to purchase hardware and software resources, but can pay and use as needed. The result is Netflix's ability to respond quickly to user needs, enabling efficient and elastic service.
