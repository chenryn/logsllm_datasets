I've got a 8Gb memory server. So the problem is not the 2Gb limit for php.
I Run under Debian with PHP 

PHP 5.3.3-7+squeeze3 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Jun 28 2011 08:24:40)

Each time i try to navigate through the admin panel, it crashes, and downloads the page i want to reach (an empty .php file).

Where does it comes from ? 

Thanks.

EDIT

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
       ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        ServerName weareelsewhere.com

        DocumentRoot /var/www/nicolas

        CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access-nico.com.log combined

  &lt;Directory "/var/www/nicolas"&gt;
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny

  &lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

Assistant: this was solved in a quick chat.
seems that the problem appeared after APC php module was enabled. once APC was disabled the problem disappeared. It is unknown to me why APC was causing problems.

worth mentioning here for further references in similar scenarios... I guess.
