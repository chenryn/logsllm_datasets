### Title: Botconf 2018 - Letâ€™s Go with a Go RAT!

**Abstract:**

Go (also known as Golang) is an open-source programming language developed by Google in 2009. It is designed to be versatile and can run on multiple platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, and Android. While Golang has been used in some notable malware, such as Mirai (which utilized it for its Command and Control (C2) program), other examples like Encriyoko, Lady, GoARM.Bot, and Go Athena RAT have also been identified. However, Golang is not yet as widely adopted for malware development compared to more traditional languages.

In this presentation, we will introduce the analysis of a new Golang-based malware, which we have named "WellMess." This malware has been observed operating across multiple platforms and was first detected in January 2018. Our team's analysis, combined with the traffic generated from its communication with C2 servers, confirms that WellMess is a distinct and previously unreported threat.

We will provide a detailed reverse engineering explanation of the WellMess malware, including a demonstration of its botnet operations.
