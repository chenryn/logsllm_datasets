User: How to set the firewall rules of the Linux system to restrict access from a certain IP address?
Assistant: 1. Confirm the firewall status First, you need to confirm whether the firewall is enabled. Use the following command to check the firewall status: ``` systemctl status firewalld ``` 2. Add IP address to the blacklist Suppose you want to prohibit the host with IP address 192.168.0.10 from accessing the Linux system. Use the following command to add the IP address to the firewall's blacklist: ``` firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=192.168.0.10 reject' ``` where, The --permanent flag indicates that the rule will be stored persistently until manually deleted or restarted the firewall service. The --add-rich-rule parameter specifies adding a custom rule. In this case, the rule blocks all traffic from the specified IP address. 3. Apply firewall rules After adding the rules, you need to use the following command to reload the firewall rules for them to take effect: ``` firewall-cmd --reload ``` Now all traffic from 192.168.0.10 will be blocked.
