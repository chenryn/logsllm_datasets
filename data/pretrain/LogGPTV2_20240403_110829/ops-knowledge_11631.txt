Under macOS (10.11.6), I installed the latest Python 3.5 version of Anaconda. Anaconda Navigator launches Spyder, Jupyter, and QtConsole successfully, with Python 3.5.2 running in these environments.

Additionally, I created a Python 2.7 environment from the command line using the following command:
```bash
conda create --name python2 python=2.7 anaconda
```

However, when I open Anaconda Navigator, navigate to the "Environments" section on the left pane, and select my `python2` environment, the applications (Spyder, Jupyter, and QtConsole) still launch with Python 3.5.2, even after selecting the `python2` environment and returning to the Home screen.

I attempted to close Anaconda Navigator, activate the `python2` environment via the command line using:
```bash
source activate python2
```
and then reopened Anaconda Navigator, but the issue persists, and the applications continue to use Python 3.5.2.

### Solution:
To launch Spyder, Jupyter, or QtConsole with Python 2.7, you can use the terminal instead of Anaconda Navigator. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Activate the `python2` environment:
   ```bash
   source activate python2
   ```
3. Launch the desired application. For example, to launch Spyder:
   ```bash
   spyder
   ```

By using this method, you can ensure that Spyder, Jupyter, or QtConsole will run with the Python 2.7 environment. While this approach bypasses the Anaconda Navigator, it allows you to work with the desired Python version.
