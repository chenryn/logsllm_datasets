User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Linux: Schedule command to run once after reboot (RunOnce equivalent) I'd like to schedule a command to run after reboot on a Linux box. I know how to do this so the command consistently runs after every reboot with a @reboot crontab entry, however I only want the command to run once. After it runs, it should be removed from the queue of commands to run. I'm essentially looking for a Linux equivalent to RunOnce in the Windows world.

In case it matters:

$ uname -a
Linux devbox 2.6.27.19-5-default #1 SMP 2009-02-28 04:40:21 +0100 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
$ bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.2.48(1)-release (x86_64-suse-linux-gnu)
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
$ cat /etc/SuSE-release
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86_64)
VERSION = 11
PATCHLEVEL = 0


Is there an easy, scriptable way to do this?

Assistant: Create an @reboot entry in your crontab to run a script called /usr/local/bin/runonce.

Create a directory structure called /etc/local/runonce.d/ran using mkdir -p.

Create the script /usr/local/bin/runonce as follows:

#!/bin/sh
for file in /etc/local/runonce.d/*
do
    if [ ! -f "$file" ]
    then
        continue
    fi
    "$file"
    mv "$file" "/etc/local/runonce.d/ran/$file.$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S)"
    logger -t runonce -p local3.info "$file"
done


Now place any script you want run at the next reboot (once only) in the directory /etc/local/runonce.d and chown and chmod +x it appropriately. Once it's been run, you'll find it moved to the ran subdirectory and the date and time appended to its name. There will also be an entry in your syslog.
