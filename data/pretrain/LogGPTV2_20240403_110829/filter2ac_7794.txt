### Title: The Hidden RCE Surfaces That Control the Droids

**Abstract:**

The Android operating system relies on a vast array of libraries to process incoming files through both standard AOSP (Android Open Source Project) APIs and vendor-specific APIs. These libraries are not only used for handling internal format files but also for processing files during regular use of system applications, including those from untrusted sources such as MMS, chat apps, emails, web downloads, and files displayed in Gallery/Photos or opened in Settings.

During our research, we discovered that AOSP and nearly all mainstream Android devices expose previously overlooked remote attack surfaces, particularly in the context of supporting higher-definition images, complex media files, and specific configuration files in native code. This led us to identify numerous memory corruption vulnerabilities in various file formats, such as quram, spi, sdocx, and others. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve 0-click or 1-click Remote Code Execution (RCE) on devices from different manufacturers, including AOSP itself.

All identified vulnerabilities have been reported and confirmed by vendors, resulting in over 20 CVEs with High or Critical severity ratings from Google and other major manufacturers like Samsung.

In this presentation, we will:
- Discuss these newly discovered attack surfaces.
- Explain how we identified the vulnerabilities through code auditing and fuzzing, with a focus on efficient binary fuzzing techniques for closed-source vendor libraries, an area that has not been widely explored.
- Share our work on analyzing and exploiting these vulnerabilities, including methods for gaining control of the program counter (PC) and obtaining reverse shells.

This session aims to provide insights into the hidden security risks within the Android ecosystem and offer practical guidance on how to mitigate these threats.
