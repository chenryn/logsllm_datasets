User: I have my server on Google App Engine
One of my jobs is to match a huge set of records with another.
This takes very long, if i have to match 10000 records with 100.
Whats the best way of implementing this.
Im, using Web2py stack and deployed my application on Google App Engine.
Assistant: maybe i'm misunderstanding something, but thos sounds like the perfect match for a task queue, and i can't see how multithreading will help, as i thought this only ment that you can serve many responses simultaneously, it won't help if your responses take longer than the 30 second limit.
With a task you can add it, then process until the time limit, then recreate another task with the remainder of the task if you haven't finished your job by the time limit.
