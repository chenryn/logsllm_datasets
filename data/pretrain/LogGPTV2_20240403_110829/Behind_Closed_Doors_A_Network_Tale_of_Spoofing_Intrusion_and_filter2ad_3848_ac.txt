at production DNS servers are typically measured in queries per
second, and our maximum per-destination rate was on the order
of four per day—plus a one-time series of fewer than 30 follow-up
queries—the impact of our experiment would have been barely,
if at all, noticeable. Second, the SOA (start of authority) record of
the DNS zone corresponding to our query names (see Section 3.3)
included: 1) a RNAME (responsible name) eld with an email address
with which we could be contacted, e.g., for more information or to
opt out; and 2) an MNAME (master server name) eld with the domain
name of a Web sever providing a brief description of this project.
The project description included contact and opt-out information.
The system from which the queries with non-spoofed sources were
sent (see Section 3.5) also ran a Web server with the same project
information.
3.8 Response and Opt Out
Despite the approximately 1 billion queries that we sent to nearly
12 million target IP addresses, we received just ve communications
related to our experiment. All respondents requested to be opted
out of our experiment. In each case, we obliged their request and
stopped sending spoofed queries to their address space. When they
requested, we also oered more information about our experiment
and some of our initial ndings. After learning more about our work,

one inquiring administrator actually wrote back and requested that
his address space be put back into our set of targets!
From four of the ve communications we received, it was evident
that our spoofed-source query reached its target DNS resolver, but
that the DNS resolver refused to handle the query (i.e., with a
REFUSED response code). This was evidence that our ndings are
in some ways a conservative estimate of the pervasiveness of the
lack of DSAV. Even with a pool of spoofed sources to select from,
we were unable to nd a legitimate source for every server that we
reached.
4 DSAV EXPERIMENT RESULTS
The pervasive lack of DSAV well exceeded our expectations. Of the
11,204,889 IPv4 addresses targeted with our experiment, at least
519,447 (4.6%) received and handled one or more of our queries,
as indicated by a recursive-to-authoritative query observed at our
authoritative DNS servers. Similarly, of the 784,777 IPv6 addresses
we targeted, 49,008 (6.2%) recursively handled at least one of our
spoofed-source queries. While the gures for target IP addresses
are nominal, the number of ASes with aected IP addresses was far
more pervasive: 26,206 (49%) of 53,922 IPv4 ASes and 3,952 (50%) of
7,904 IPv6 ASes were vulnerable to inltration via spoofed-source
packets. These numbers represent the lower bound of networks
that do not support DSAV.
Table 1 and Table 2 list the 10 countries representing the most
ASes in our data set and those having the highest percentages of IP
addresses accepting spoofed-source packets, respectively. The coun-
try for each IP address was looked up using MaxMind’s GeoLite2
data [35], and each AS was associated with one or more countries
based on the GeoIP data for its constituent IP addresses. Thus, an
AS might be counted multiple times in dierent countries. The data
set included over twice as many United States (US)-based ASes
than the next most represented country, Brazil. Nevertheless, the
diversity of percentage of ASNs lacking DSAV (i.e., “reachable”)
is apparent, with the US being below average at 28%, and Brazil,
Russia, and Ukraine showing over that over half of ASes lack DSAV.
In terms of reachable target IP addresses, Algeria and Morocco
topped the list, each with over 50% of targeted IP addresses having
received our DNS queries.
4.1 Spoofed Source Eectiveness
We now consider the eectiveness of the (up to) 101 sources that
were used, in terms of eliciting DNS activity of their target. All
numbers are presented as a fraction of the total reachable targets.
We rst analyze the overall fraction of spoofed sources that
reached their targets. For nearly half of all reachable target IP
addresses (collectively IPv4 and IPv6), only one or two sources re-
sulted in reachable queries. The median number of spoofed sources
with which queries reached IPv4 and IPv6 destinations was 3 and
2, respectively. However, 16% of IPv4 destinations and 9% of IPv6
destinations were reachable using over 50 spoofed sources.
Next we analyze the eectiveness of the dierent categories
of spoofed sources (see Section 3.2), in terms of DSAV detection.
Spoofed sources from every category reached at least one IP tar-
get. The breakdown of target IP addresses and ASNs reachable by
spoofed source category is shown in Table 3, under the heading
“Category-Inclusive.” For IPv4, other-prex and same-prex sources
were the most prevalent, reaching 78% and 63% of all IPv4 targets
that received spoofed-source queries. The other-prex category was
also well represented for IPv6 targets, reaching 45% of all reachable
IPv6 targets. However, the IPv6 sources that dominated reachabil-
ity were in the same-prex and destination-as-source categories,
reaching 84% and 70% of reachable IPv6 targets, respectively. It
was notable that the percentage of target-reaching queries that
used destination-as-source was much higher for IPv6 targets (70%)
than that for IPv4 hosts (17%). We observed in our lab testing that
modern Linux kernels drop destination-as-source packets that use
IPv4, but IPv6 destination-as-source packets are sent to user space
(see Section 5.5). Thus, if the fraction of reachable Linux targets
is equal between the IPv6 and IPv4 realms, we would expect the
percentage of IPv6 destination-as-source hits to be higher. Private-
address sources also had a presence, reaching 3.4% of reachable
IPv4 targets and 4.3% of reachable IPv6 targets, respectively.
