User: I decided to rewrite all our Bash scripts in Python (there are not so many of them) as my first Python project. The reason for it is that although being quite fluent in Bash I feel it's somewhat archaic language and since our system is in the first stages of its developments I think switching to Python now will be the right thing to do.
Are there scripts that should always be written in Bash? For example, we have an init.d daemon script - is it OK to use Python for it?
We run CentOS.
Thanks.
Assistant: It is OK in the sense that you can do it. But the scripts in /etc/init.d usually need to load config data and some functions (for example to print the nice green OK on the console) which will be hard to emulate in Python.
So try to convert those which make sense (i.e. those which contain complex logic). If you need job control (starting/stopping processes), then bash is better suited than Python.
