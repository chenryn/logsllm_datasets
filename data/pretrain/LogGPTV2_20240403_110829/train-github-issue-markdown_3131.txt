Reproduction:
  * Create and open a file that contains any warnings or errors from deno, let's it be `a.ts`, for example.
  * Add the file to the exclude list in `deno.json`:
    "lint": {
       "files": {
         "exclude": ["a.ts"]
       }
     }
Config re-applies but diagnostics from `a.ts` do not disappear.  
If we edit `deno.json` before opening the file - it works as should.
