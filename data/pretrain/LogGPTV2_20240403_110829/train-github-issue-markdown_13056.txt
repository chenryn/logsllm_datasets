I have 3 monitors, the two outer monitors are identical. See the below
screenshot from nvidia control panel.

When configuring Fancy Zones, if I set up a zone on the left monitor, It will
also be set to the right monitor. If I open a program, and snap it to a zone
on the right monitor, close it down, then reopen it, It will open up on the
equivalent zone on the left monitor. It's as if Fancy Zones is only able to
'see' one of the two monitors. I can only assume this is because its using the
monitor name as the identifier or something.
Let me know if you need any more information.
