it provides an integrity check on the data -
it will be evident when an attempt is made to verify the signature; 
if the data is altered in any way 
â€¢ 
an independent third party can verify the signature. 
These features make digital signatures a very attractive technology option for 
authenticity. 
In practice,  digital  signatures  are  not made by encrypting  entire  documents. 
The speed limitations on public-key cryptosystems would make the process intol(cid:173)
erably slow.  In order to overcome this problem a digest, or hash, of the message 
is created. A hash function takes a variable amount of input data and compresses 
it down to a fixed length. For example, the secure hash algorithm (SHA) [16]  for 
use in the US digital signature standard (DSS) [17] takes data and hashes it down 
to  160 bits.  The hash function  is  so designed that even changing one  bit of the 
input creates  a  very different hash  value.  Of course  there  is  a  small  probability 
that  two  documents  will  hash  to  the  same  value.  However,  this  is  a  very  small 
probability  for  a  well-designed  hash  function.  It  is  this  hash  value  that  is 
encrypted with the private key and appended to the data to form the signature. 
To verify the signature Alice decrypts the signature and checks the result with 
the hash value of the document. Calculating hash values is a very quick process. 
The procedure for creating a digital signature is shown schematically in  Fig. 5.8.

Fig. 5.8  To create a digital signature a digest is  made of the data. This digest, or hash, is 
encrypted with the private key of the signer and then appended to the original data. If either the data 
or the signature is altered they will no longer agree when an attempt to verify the signature is made. 
Any electronic data can be signed. The beauty of using  a digital  signature is 
that once the data has been  signed with a trusted  key  it carries its own certifica(cid:173)
tion.  In  other words  such data can be  passed and  stored on  open networks.  The 
trust  to  a  large  extent  has  been  transferred  to  the  data  rather  than  the  network 
infrastructure.  Trusted  data  can  be  stored  anywhere.  One  particular example  is 
the  storage  of personal  certificates  and  other  information  on  smart  cards.  The 
potential  applications  are  many.  Another example  is  the  signing  of software  so 
that only properly signed software will work in a software suite making the prop(cid:173)
agation  of viruses,  for  example,  much  more  difficult.  It is  the  ability  of digital 
signatures to allow  the trust to  be carried by  the data that enables us  to  consider 
such applications. 
Digital signatures are one of the fundamental enabling technologies for elec(cid:173)
tronic commerce.  However,  we  have glossed over the  real  source of trust in  the 
system.  The  public  keys  for  verification  of signatures  must  be  trusted.  In  our 
terms  this  means  that  public  keys  must  themselves  be  digitally  signed  by  an 
appropriate  authority.  A  signed  public  key  together  with  the  public  key  of the 
signing  authority  is  usually  termed  a certificate.  Certificates and  the  authorities 
who issue them are dealt with in  much  more detail in  Chapter 4.  The authorities 
issuing  certificates  for  public  keys  are  known  as  certification  authorities  or 
(CAs). 
Generalization of the concept of a CA  leads us  to  the  notion of trusted  third 
parties or TIPs which are the subject of the next section. 
DIGITAL SIGNATURES AND TRUSTED THIRD PARTIES  85 
5.4.2  Trusted third  parties 
Having  accepted  that  public  keys  have  to  be  trusted  and  that  one  way  of 
establishing that trust is to have an independent body sign those keys we  are now 
in  a position to  generalize the  notion.  Public keys are  simply  a specific  fonn  of 
data. Any data can be certified by an  appropriate authority. CAs for certification 
of public keys  are just one example of a class  of independent  service  providers 
known  as  trusted  third  parties  or  TTPs.  A  TTP  is  an  entity  that  is  trusted  to 
perform in a certain way given a specific set of instances. There is nothing new in 
the concept of a TTP and we use many kinds almost daily. Examples of TTPs are 
banks,  lawyers,  vehicle  licensing  centres,  etc.  However,  we  tend  to  restrict  the 
tenn  TTP  to  those  providing  trust  services  over an  electronic  communications 
network. 
If electronic  commerce  is  to  become  a  reality  it  must  be  underpinned  by 
trust.  Merchants  and customers need  to  have  some fonn  of trust in  the  transac(cid:173)
tions  they are conducting.  That trust can be supplied by a network of TTPs.  So, 
for example, my bank could issue me with an electronic certificate containing my 
signed public key for  use in commercial transactions. Merchants could then ver(cid:173)
ify  my  transactions  firstly  by  checking  my  signature  and  then  verifying  the 
bank's certificate of my  public  key.  The  public  key  of the  bank  could  itself be 
certified by a higher authority  in  the  trust chain and any  process  of verification 
would  need to  trace  a path of trust  through  this  chain  to  a  single  point  of trust 
which might well be an institution like the EC or the UN.  This hierarchy of trust 
and its  possible complexity is  illustrated in  Fig.  5.9.  Note the  possible existence 
of cross certification.  In practice,  it would not be expected that this hierarchy of 
trust will  be  more  than two or three  layers deep  and for  most  purposes  a single 
certificate should be sufficient. 
Digital  certificates  can  be  stored  on  smartcards.  With  the  likelihood  that 
future  PCs are equipped with smartcard readers every transaction could,  in  prin(cid:173)
ciple, be protected by strong cryptographic mechanisms.  We  might imagine, for 
example, the situation where the necessary certificates for driving a vehicle were 
stored on a smart card. If cars were to be fitted  with smartcard readers we  could 
prevent unauthorized users  from  driving.  Other interesting digital  signature and 
smartcard applications are easy to imagine. 
There are a multitude of applications for TTPs and digital signature technol(cid:173)
ogy. In this brief introduction we have glossed over a few.  TTPs will be a funda(cid:173)
mental component of a future global electronic market-place. There are no other 
practical  alternatives  for  distributing  trust.  It is  probable  that  large  institutions 
who  already  function  to  some  extent as  trusted  intennediaries  in  our everyday 
lives may wish to become TTPs. Such institutions might include banks, telecom(cid:173)
munications companies, insurance brokers, etc.

Illustration of the kind of hierarchy of trust that might exist in a future trust 
infrastructure. Note the possible existence of cross certification. Each chain of verification must be 
traceable to a single point of trust. 
The UK government has recognized the importance of having an appropriate 
trust infrastructure in place to support electronic commerce and is preparing leg(cid:173)
islation for the licensing of TIPs in the UK.  An appropriate licensing regime is 
likely to reinforce the overall trust in the system and together with an appropriate 
legal  setting  for  digital  signatures  should  form  the  basis  of a legislative  frame(cid:173)
work for ensuring the success of electronic trading in the UK. 
5.5  GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF CRYPTOGRAPHY 
5.5.1 
Export controls 
Cryptography is viewed by most Western governments as a munition and as such 
subject to  stringent export regulations covered by international agreements  such 
as  the  Wassenaar  Arrangement.  In  order  to  export  products  containing 
cryptographic  mechanisms  an  export  license  must  be  sought.  In  general,  the 
export of cryptosystems for confidentiality is much more difficult than the export 
of cryptosystems  exclusively  designed  for  authenticity.  One  peculiar effect  of 
these export controls has been that software containing the source code for strong 
cryptosystems is not exportable, whereas a book containing the same source code 
printed on paper can quite happily move across national boundaries. 
In  general, the export limits  are expressed in terms  of key  sizes.  For secret(cid:173)
key systems only 40-bit systems are allowed for general export. If the assumption 
GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF CRYPTOGRAPHY  87 
is  made that export controls exist for national security reasons it follows that 40-
bit  cryptosystems  are  trivially  breakable  by  national  security  agencies.  This 
causes  some  concern  to  companies  whose  operations  span  national  boundaries 
especially  where  they  operate in jurisdictions  whose  national  security  agencies 
have  stated policies of using  their skills  to  favour their own  national  industries. 
Actually, as recent work has shown', 40-bit cryptosystems should not be consid(cid:173)
ered secure even against adversaries with modest computational resources. 
It is difficult to  compare key  sizes for  secret- and  public-key  cryptosystems 
directly.  A comparison can be made by comparing the fastest  known algorithms 
for factoring or finding discrete logs with the time required to perform exhaustive 
key searches for secret-key systems. Table 5.2,  giving direct key length compar(cid:173)
isons  between  public- and  secret-key  systems,  has  been  taken  from  Schneier's 
book [4].

As  a  general  rule  of thumb  if a  confidentiality  system  can  be  exported  its 
strength will be about equivalent to a 40-bit secret-key system or less.  However, 
as  40-bit systems  should  not be used  to  protect data of any  real  value,  a home(cid:173)
grown solution to confidentiality is required for protection of valuable data. 
Despite  most  countries  employing  severe  export  controls  on  cryptography, 
few  countries  apply  import controls  or usage  restrictions  within  their own  bor(cid:173)
ders. This has led to the situation where US  software developers are creating soft(cid:173)
ware for use within the US with strong cryptography but crippling that capability 
when the same product is  shipped for export. The export-strength versions offer 
inadequate protection for transactions of any real  value and the security of these 
products  should  only  be  relied  upon  for  the  lowest  value  transactions.  Thus  I 
would have no problem in trusting my credit card details, for example, to systems 
I  At the beginning of February  1997, a student at Berkeley, Ian Goldberg, managed to crack a 40-bit 
cipher in just 3'h hour<_ 
88  CRYPTOGRAPHY 
using  40-bit  cryptography  whereas  I  would  be  very  wary  of using  the  same 
crypto system for transferring larger sums. 
In  the  UK  there  are  no  restrictions  on  the  use  of cryptography  within  the 
national  boundaries,  but  because  of the  domination  of the  US  in  the  software 
market the  commercial  use  of strong  cryptography  is  hampered by  the  lack of 
any suitable US products. US companies are continually applying pressure on the 
US  government to relax the export rules because they feel that the severe export 
regime is damaging their profitability. So far they have met with little success. 
Products  for  authentication  are  treated  very  differently.  Most  governments 
recognize  the  importance  of a  strong  authentication  framework  for  electronic 
commerce. Systems for strong digital signatures, for example, can in general be 
exported  provided  they  cannot  be  used  to  offer confidentiality.  Indeed  the  US 
government has made its digital signature standard freely  available for use in the 
hope that this will promote its widespread adoption. This standard developed by 
the NSA seems to be a strong digital signature method that cannot effectively be 
used for confidentiality. 
An interesting question prompted by the 40-bit export limit is  how large we 
should  make  our key  to  be  safe  against  attack.  It is  clear that 40 bits  is  inade(cid:173)
quate. Is 56-bit DES sufficient, for example? Again the answer to this has to be a 
qualified no because it seems to be perfectly possible to construct computational 
machines  that will  uncover a  DES  key  in  a  matter  of hours.  The  cost of these 
machines is within the budget capabilities of small-to-medium-sized enterprises. 
If we  take  as  our benchmark figure  the  sum  of $300,000,000,  that  is,  the  esti(cid:173)
mated cost of one operation by the US  Navy to recover a Russian submarine, we 
can  assume that the  NSA,  for  example,  has  similar resources  available to  it for 
codebreaking. With this kind of financial resource the NSA could well have the 
capability  of finding  keys  substantially  larger  than  56  bits.  This  is,  of course, 
complete  speculation,  but  further  details  and  some  hard  facts  and  figures  are 
available to the interested reader [18]. 
We  should  not  be  overly  concerned  about  the  doings  of national  security 
agencies.  They  will  continue doing  whatever they  need to  to  stay  ahead  of the 
game.  What is  of more  concern  is  the  increasing  ability  of organizations  with 
more modest resources to crack cryptosystems. Also of concern are the growing 
number of recreational codebreakers who attempt to uncover keys for no obvious 
financial  motive.  Bad  pUblicity  from  this  kind  of unwelcome  attention  could 
result in a significant and possibly costly loss of reputation. These attacks should 
not be a problem for a company which operates exclusively within their national 
boundaries.  These  companies  can  employ  whatever  cryptography  they  require 
for the full implementation of their security policy. When a comany's operations 
take it across national boundaries, the vexed question of export is raised again. 
A possible solution to  the  whole question of the export of cryptography has 
been  proposed  in  the  last  few  years.  Clearly  with  all  indications  being  that 
electronic  commerce  will  grow,  it  is  important  to  allow  companies  to  operate 
GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF CRYPTOGRAPHY  89 
effectively  across  national  boundaries.  It has  been  suggested  that  governments 
will  permit  the  export  of  stronger  cryptography  giving  strong  confidentiality 
provided  the  key  has  been  lodged,  or  escrowed,  with  an  appropriate  authority. 
Indeed, the US  government has  said it will grant export licences for  56-bit DES 
provided companies work towards having a suitable key escrow  scheme in place 
within  two  years.  Not  surprisingly  key  escrow  schemes  have  aroused  a certain 
degree of controversy. 
5.5.2 
Key escrow 
Over  the  last  few  years  there  has  been  a  significant increase  in  the  number  of 
people  with  access  to,  and  using,  strong  cryptosystems for  confidentiality.  This 
disturbs  law  enforcement  agencies  and  national  security  agencies  who  have 
traditionally  been  able  to  eavesdrop  on  conversations  in  pursuit  of  their 
legitimate  activities.  However,  these  agencies  also  recognize  the  equally 
legitimate needs of individuals and businesses to  be  able to conduct their lawful 
business with some degree of privacy and security. In order to balance these two 
conflicting  needs  it  was  proposed,  firstly  in  the  US,  to  use  escrowed  key 
cryptography.  Key  escrow  basically  implies  that  a  third  party,  possibly  a 
governmental organization keeps all,  or part, of your private key  until  such time 
as  they  are  presented  with  a warrant or other legal  empowerment  which  grants 
the law enforcement agencies access to your key.
