User: How can I get a list of removable drives (plugged into USB) in Linux?  I'm fine with using KDE, GNOME or other DE libraries if it would make things easier.
Assistant: This is what I use from bash:
lsblk  --pairs --nodeps | grep 'RM="1"'
Sample output:
NAME="sda" MAJ:MIN="8:0" RM="1" SIZE="59.5G" RO="0" TYPE="disk" MOUNTPOINT=""
Note it is listing the devices, not its partitions. If you like to see the partitions also,
lsblk  --pairs | grep 'RM="1"'
