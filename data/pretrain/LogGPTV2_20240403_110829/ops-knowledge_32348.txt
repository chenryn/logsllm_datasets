Question: In the context of Apple's Secure Enclave, which combination of components and features contribute to the security of non-volatile user data? Select all that apply.
"A": "The public key accelerator (PKA), which is designed to resist SPA and DPA, encrypts user data.",
"B": "Secure non-volatile storage paired with a Secure Storage Component, using an encrypted and authenticated protocol for exclusive access to entropy.",
"C": "The True Random Number Generator (TRNG), which generates secure random data used whenever the Secure Enclave generates cryptographic keys or other entropy.",
"D": "The device group ID (GID), which is common to all devices using a given SoC, is used to cryptographically tie user data to a particular device model."
