User: Aptana Studio is my primary Python IDE and I have been using it for years with much joy and success! Recently, when I start Aptana Studio it fails to recognize any PyDev projects that I have previously created. I noticed that this was happening after installing a recent update of the IDE. I tried uninstalling Aptana and resinstalling the latest version from the website. Nada...I updated Java thinking there might be a misalignment between Java versions or something like that. Nada...The latest version of Eclipse works fine and Aptana seems to be functioning correctly for everything except for PyDev (Python).
I am running a current version of Windows 8. Does anyone know how to fix this or maybe trouble shoot the problem? PyDev worked perfectly in Aptana Studio until I installed the update. Has anyone come across this and know how to fix it?
Assistant: Aptana 3.5.0 and PyDev 3.0 does not work under Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks yet. PyDev reports builtin symbols such as None could not be recognized.
I rolled back to 3.4.2 as well.
