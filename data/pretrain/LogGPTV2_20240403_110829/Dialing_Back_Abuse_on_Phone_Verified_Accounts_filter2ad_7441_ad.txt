rently exist from Telesign and Pindrop, though the method-
ology or accuracy of these systems is not public.
6.1.2 Phone Reputation
Where carrier reputation can help throttle the creation
rate of PVA, phone reputation can outright block abusive
registrations. The primary challenge of phone reputation is
the velocity of abuse. As we discussed in Section 4.2, 62% of
phones used to verify abusive accounts have a lifetime un-
der one hour. Consequently, if abuse reports cannot ﬂag a
phone number in time, the window for a reputation system
to impact abuse will have passed. One option is for services
to restrict the velocity of new registrations tied to the same
phone number (e.g.
forcing users to wait a period before
a phone number is re-usable), but this oﬀers no protection
if numbers are single-use. This beneﬁt could be expanded
Figure 7: Aggregate contribution of fraudulent PVA of
carriers ranked by popularity. Miscreants use the top carrier
to verify 20% of all abusive PVA and the top 10 to verify
50% of PVA.

riers outright would impact a disproportionate number of
legitimate users.
by services sharing abuse information which would prevent
veriﬁcation as a service merchants (discussed in Section 4.1)
from registering multiple accounts cross-service with a sin-
gle phone number. We also believe that phone reputation
can become a predictive score that assesses the risk of a
previously unseen phones tied to newly registered account.
Potential features include the sequentiality of phone num-
bers and whether the phone number has appeared in other
contexts before. We leave such a system for future work.
6.1.3 Phone Reveriﬁcation
The relatively short lifetime of phone numbers—a median
of less than 1 hour in our analysis—raises the potential for
defenders to re-verify phone numbers as an eﬀective abuse
escalation. By limiting re-veriﬁcation as a response to sus-
picious activity (e.g. sending an abnormal number of email;
rapidly subscribing to hundreds of YouTube channels), le-
gitimate users will avoid the friction imposed by phone ver-
iﬁcation. Conversely, miscreants who purchased accounts
will not have access to the original phone number tied to an
account after it changes hands. Similarly, spammers that
are vertically integrated and register their own credentials
must retain access to thousands of SIM cards, something
that may not be possible if miscreants rely on veriﬁcation
as a service merchants. This adds yet another dimension to
the complexity of circumventing phone veriﬁcation, where

tity of phone numbers miscreants can draw from. We note
that Facebook may already rely on this practice based on
chatter from underground forums, but cannot conﬁrm.
6.2 Open Challenges
6.2.1 Phone Chaining
When miscreants abuse free call forwarding services such
as Google Voice, they must register a phone number to serve
as the forwarding endpoint. While this initial number is
intended as a safeguard—similar to email veriﬁcation or a
CAPTCHA—the existence of other free (virtual) numbers
overcomes this protection. This is exacerbated by the po-
tential many-to-one relationship between seed numbers and
numbers handed out by forwarding telephony services. This
leads to a vulnerability we call phone chaining. In particular,
miscreants can use a single free mobile number or free VOIP
number that fans out to multiple free forwarding numbers.
These in turn can serve as forwarding endpoints at other
services, with miscreants repeating the process ad nauseam
to create an arbitrarily sized tree of phone numbers for veri-
ﬁcation purposes. Even if virtual number providers prevent
chaining between their own phone number pool, miscreants
can obfuscate the original identity of a number by cycling
through multiple forwarding services for each level of the
tree. Absent a comprehensive forwarding blacklist—which
is diﬃcult to acquire due to phone ranges constantly chang-
ing hands and limited opacity into phone ownership—there
is nothing to prevent this practice. An alternative is to have
telephony services charge for forwarding numbers, but global
adoption is required to prevent miscreants from constantly
shifting their operations to free providers.
6.2.2 Resource Exhaustion Attacks
Phone veriﬁcation is not free. Services must pay a fee
for each attempted SMS or phone challenge. The cost of
phone veriﬁcation exposes services to resource exhaustion
attacks. Miscreants can request thousands of spurious ver-
iﬁcation codes for non-existent numbers or phones tied to
legitimate victims (who may in turn be charged a delivery
fee). Assuming a ﬁxed daily budget, a fail-open system will
allow miscreants to bypass phone veriﬁcation all together;
a fail-closed system will block legitimate users from regis-
tering new accounts. This challenge also exists for email
veriﬁcation—services that generate excessive bounce notiﬁ-
cations expose themselves to throttling on the receiving end
that can degrade the delivery rate of important messages.
While services can perform a risk analysis for each new reg-
istration attempt and block suspicious registrations before a
SMS challenge is sent, we view resource exhaustion attacks
as an open challenge.
6.2.3 Compromised Phones
The widespread adoption of Android and iOS devices car-
ries with it an emerging risk of mobile malware [8].
In-
stances already exist of the Zeus banking trojan intercepting
two-factor authentication PINs for liquidating a victim’s as-
sets [27]. Other threats include mobile drive-by-downloads
installing the NotCompatible malware family that converts
a victim’s phone into a mobile proxy [19]. While we ﬁnd no
evidence of miscreants using compromised phones as ver-
iﬁcation endpoints, there is no reason that compromised
phones will not become a commodity market like compro-
mised hosts [5]. This possibility undermines the longterm
sustainability of phone veriﬁcation and any protection pro-
vided by carrier-level reputation. Similarly, it forces phone
reputation systems into a reactive position, eﬀectively be-
coming phone blacklists much like existing IP and DNS
blacklists [21].
7. RELATED WORK
Monetizing Account Access. Miscreants leverage bulk
registered accounts to expose legitimate users to spam,
phishing, and malware [9, 11]. At its heart, a substantial
amount of spam serves to advertise products and lure people
to purchase pharmaceuticals, replica goods, and counterfeit
software, often with the aid of complex infrastructure man-
aged by aﬃliates and aﬃliate programs [14]. Recent alter-
natives in monetization include ad syndication services and
ad-based URL shortening [25]. These examples highlight
the range of strategies that miscreants employ to generate a
proﬁt once they gain access to account credentials.
Reputation Systems. Reputation is commonly used to
prevent or limit abuse of web services. One technique, with
roots in email spam ﬁltering, is the use of IP addresses for
reputation [13]. Using IP reputation enables a web service
to quickly score actions and label them as abusive or benign.
IP reputation can become error prone and new techniques
have been developed for evaluating IP address ranges that
are populated with a mix of benign and abusive actions [13].
Approaches to reputation have also evaluated automated
scoring using network-level features [12]. In addition to IP
addresses, other forms of reputation are used to label do-
mains [4], and accounts on web services by leveraging the
observed actions of existing users to vet new accounts [28].
Phone reputation over voice has also been explored based on
audio features introduced by telephony networks [2], though
such features do not extend to numbers used purely for SMS.
Applications of Phone Veriﬁcation. In addition to pre-
venting fraudulent account registration, SMS and phone ver-
iﬁcation is used broadly to prevent account hijacking. One
widely deployed use is two-factor authentication for online
banking. With SMS two-factor, a one-time code is sent via
SMS and used along with the username and password to
login [20]. Even two-factor authentication is not without
vulnerabilities, and criminals have used malware to inter-
cept SMS messages on the target phone [10, 20]. Similar to
two-factor authentication, other uses for phone veriﬁcation
include account recovery, and as an informational channel
to alert users of changes to their account.
8. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a longitudinal study of the
underlying technical and ﬁnancial factors inﬂuencing the di-
minishing eﬀectiveness of phone veriﬁcation. To conduct our
study, we combined underground intelligence gleaned from
4,695 phone veriﬁed accounts purchased from 14 blackmar-
ket merchants as well as 300,000 phone veriﬁed accounts
disabled by Google for spam and abuse. We found that
merchants were capable of registering a steady stream of
thousands of PVA that subsequently sold for $85–$500 per
1K to the underground. Many of these merchants appeared
to operate in a fashion similar to spam aﬃliate programs,
reiterating that specialization with the underground ecosys-
tem is the norm. We found that merchants used inexpensive
VOIP numbers to circumvent the intended cost of acquiring
SIM cards, eﬀectively invalidating the defense provided by
phone veriﬁcation. As this practice became a widespread,
we observed a simultaneous market-wide price drop of 30–
40% for Google PVA until Google penalized veriﬁcations
from frequently abused phone carriers. Our results high-
light how blackmarket monitoring can provide an invaluable
oracle into the performance of abuse safeguards. This infor-
mation vastly simpliﬁes the task of defenders keeping pace
with evolutions of the underground, in turn better protect-
ing users against spam and abuse.
