Question: You are developing an Android device that only incorporates a Class 1 biometric sensor. According to Android's tiered authentication model and integration privileges, which API should you ensure your device's biometric sensor is integrated with?
"A": "android.hardware.biometrics APIs, as all biometric classes should be compatible with it.",
"B": "ACTION_BIOMETRIC_ENROLL API, to enable users to enroll in a secure and compatible authentication method.",
"C": "BiometricManager.Authenticators interface, to specify authentication types accepted by apps.",
"D": "None, as Class 1 biometrics are not allowed to integrate with any API due to security constraints."
Answer: D
