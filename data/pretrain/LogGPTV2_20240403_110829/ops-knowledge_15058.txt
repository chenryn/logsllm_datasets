User: I have python 2.7.6 and python 3.4 installed on windows 7 machine.
When I open command prompt for windows and type python, python 2.7.6 starts by default.
I have a python script which I want to compile (or interpret officially speaking) using python 3.4.
Is there a command to use python 3.4 from c:/ prompt? or make 3.4 the default python interpreter?
thanks
Assistant: To make sure that you are always running python 3, you can modify your Windows PATH Environment variable to include the python 3 directory, and remove the python 2 directory.
