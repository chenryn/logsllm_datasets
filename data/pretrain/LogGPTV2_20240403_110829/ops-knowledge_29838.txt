User: Please provide a network architecture proposal to ensure access control to confidential data within the company.
Assistant: The following is a network architecture solution to ensure access control to confidential data within the company: 1. Implement a strong password policy: Ensure that all passwords used by employees comply with the strong password policy. A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 2. Multi-factor authentication: In addition to usernames and passwords, confidential data access should implement multi-factor authentication. This means employees need to go through an additional authentication step to prove they are legitimate users. This can be achieved through hardware tokens, mobile phone apps or biometrics. 3. Access Control List (ACL): Implement ACL to ensure that only authorized users can access confidential data. ACLs will define which users can access which data and which users cannot. The ACL method can be based on roles, that is, the access control achieved by granting permissions to roles. 4. Network traffic segmentation: Segment the internal and external networks of the company to ensure that confidential data can only be accessed through the internal network. The internal network should have corresponding access control measures to prevent external intrusion. 5. Encrypted transmission: All confidential data should be encrypted during transmission. This ensures that even if data is intercepted, its contents cannot be easily obtained. Secure with secure protocols like HTTPS and TLS. 6. Security Audit: Implement security audits to ensure that all access to confidential data within the company is recorded and audited for these records. This allows unauthorized access to be detected and appropriate action taken. The above is a network architecture scheme to ensure access control to confidential data within the company. It will ensure that only authorized users can access the data and prevent confidential data from being stolen or leaked by external intruders.
