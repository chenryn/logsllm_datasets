User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Here are some common logs
 0 20:10:42 INFO Starting executor ID 5 on host mesos-slave-07
 1 20:11:08 INFO Partition rdd_42_24 not found, computing it
 2 20:11:08 INFO Partition rdd_42_14 not found, computing it
 3 20:11:07 INFO Partition rdd_42_0 not found, computing it
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Slf4jLogger started 和 Starting remoting
B: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 Changing modify acls to: <*>
C: Starting executor ID <*> on host <*> 和 Partition rdd_<*> not found, computing it
D: SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users with view permissions: Set(yarn, curi); users with modify permissions: Set(yarn, curi) 和 Starting remoting
