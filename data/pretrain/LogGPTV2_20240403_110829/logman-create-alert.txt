Remarks
Examples
To create a new alert called, new_alert, which fires when the performance counter % Processor time in the Processor(_Total) counter group exceeds the counter value of 50, type:
logman create alert new_alert -th \Processor(_Total)\% Processor time>50
Note
The defined threshold value is based on the value collected by the counter, so in this example, the value of 50 equates to 50% Processor time.
