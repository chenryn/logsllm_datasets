Since upgrading to React 15.0.1, when rendering `` with optgroups, the
value is not set on the DOM correctly. The first option will always get
picked.
    // Renders with "Yes" selected, I expect "Maybe"
        Yes
        No
        Maybe
## Examples
React 15.0.1 Fiddle (broken)  
React 0.14.7 Fiddle (works)  
React 15.0.1 without optgroup Fiddle (works)
## Environment
OS X 10.11.4  
Safari Version 9.1 (11601.5.17.1)  
Chrome Version 49.0.2623.110 (64-bit)  
Firefox 45.0.1
_Edit: I also noticed that the same behavior occurs when using`defaultValue`._
