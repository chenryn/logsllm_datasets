In this section, we will provide a detailed walkthrough of the "Brewery Hack J1" challenge, which encompasses various aspects of digital forensics, open-source intelligence (OSINT), reverse engineering, and cryptography. Our team, consisting of msm, akrasuski1, nazywam, and shalom, worked collaboratively to solve this challenge.

### Challenge Overview
The "Brewery Hack J1" challenge required us to gather and analyze data from multiple sources, including forensic images, publicly available information, and encrypted files. The goal was to uncover the hidden message or flag embedded within the provided materials.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Collection**: We began by collecting all the necessary data, including forensic images, network captures, and any other relevant files.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Using forensic tools, we analyzed the collected data to identify any suspicious activities or anomalies.
3. **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: We conducted OSINT to gather additional information that could help in solving the challenge.
4. **Reverse Engineering**: We reverse-engineered any binaries or scripts to understand their functionality and extract useful information.
5. **Cryptography**: Finally, we decrypted any encrypted files or messages using cryptographic techniques to reveal the hidden flag.

### Detailed Walkthrough
#### Data Collection
- **Forensic Images**: We obtained forensic images of the affected systems.
- **Network Captures**: We captured network traffic to identify any malicious activities.
- **Other Files**: We gathered any other relevant files, such as logs and configuration files.

#### Forensic Analysis
- **Disk Image Analysis**: We used tools like Autopsy and Volatility to analyze the disk images for any signs of tampering or hidden data.
- **Memory Dump Analysis**: We analyzed memory dumps to identify running processes and any injected code.

#### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- **Social Media**: We searched social media platforms for any related information.
- **Public Databases**: We queried public databases and repositories for additional clues.

#### Reverse Engineering
- **Binary Analysis**: We used tools like IDA Pro and Ghidra to reverse-engineer the binaries and understand their behavior.
- **Script Analysis**: We analyzed any scripts to identify any hidden logic or obfuscation.

#### Cryptography
- **Encryption Algorithms**: We identified the encryption algorithms used in the challenge.
- **Key Extraction**: We extracted the encryption keys using various techniques, such as brute-forcing and key recovery.
- **Decryption**: We decrypted the files to reveal the hidden flag.

### Conclusion
Through a combination of forensic analysis, OSINT, reverse engineering, and cryptography, our team successfully solved the "Brewery Hack J1" challenge. The collaborative effort and diverse skill set of our team members were key to our success.
