original RFC 1035 specified maximum packet size) or at 28 bytes less than the WAN 
MTU (i.e. 1464 for ADSL routers and 1472 for most dual Ethernet routers/firewalls).

Test Report: DNSSEC Impact on Broadband Routers and Firewalls 
Based on these results, we find that most DNS proxies would be unable to return 
responses with a total packet size greater than the MTU size, while many could not 
return responses longer than 512 bytes. 
Request Flag Compatibility 
The CD (“Checking Disabled”) flag is used to inform an upstream validating resolver that 
full DNSSEC validation is not required and that any DNSSEC-related resource records 
should be returned to the client.  A security-aware resolver is expected to copy the CD 
bit from the request into its response (RFC4035, §3.2.2). 
The “AD” (“Authentic Data”) flag is currently only defined in DNS responses, to indicate 
that the upstream resolver has validated the signatures on the returned data.  However, 
because of incomplete support for EDNS0, IETF work is in progress to define a query 
containing AD=1 to indicate that the client understands the AD bit and that the server 
may return the AD bit in responses.  This response indicates that the server has 
validated the associated signatures, without returning those RRSIG RRs to the client.  
We found that this proposed change has already been implemented in ISC Bind 9.5. 
In this test, we verify that the UDP proxy can pass client-specified AD/CD flags to the 
security-aware resolver without error, and then return the resolver's response without 
modification. Two primary failure modes were seen here: 
•  Two proxies simply dropped any DNS requests that had the AD or CD bit set.  
This may be due to a strict interpretation of the definition of the Z flags in §4.1.1 
of RFC 1035 (“Reserved for future use.  Must be zero in all queries and 
responses”) without taking into account that future uses for these flags have now 
indeed been defined. 
•  One of those two also dropped any DNS response that had the AD bit set. 
•  Two proxies simply did not convey these flags from the client's DNS request to 
the upstream resolver, preventing correct interpretation and use. 
In summary, we find that most proxies handled AD/CD request flags correctly. The 
handful that did not generally could not support any DNSSEC queries at all (see below). 
DNSSEC OK Compatibility 
RFC 3225 defined the DO (“DNSSEC OK”) bit as a flag in the EDNS0 OPT RR that 
clients can use to indicate DNSSEC-awareness and request that the server return 
DNSSEC-related resource records. We ran two DO flag tests with and without the CD 
flag present. 
The first two failure modes described above for EDNS0 effectively prevent the use of the 
DO flag as well.  Unsurprisingly, therefore, the 6 proxies that failed the EDNS0 tests due 
to complete lack of support for the EDNS0 OPT RR also failed to handle any DNSSEC 
queries.  Either plain RRs are returned without any indication of error, the query is 
explicitly rejected, or the query times-out. 
One further failure mode was noted, where a proxy correctly forwarded the OPT RR to 
the upstream resolver, but then dropped any response containing authentic data (AD=1).  
This proxy also failed all of the AD/CD request tests, so appears to filter both requests 
and responses with the AD bit set.

Test Report: DNSSEC Impact on Broadband Routers and Firewalls 
In summary, 16 of 22 proxies – approximately 73% -- were capable of passing DNSSEC 
requests to a security-aware resolver and returning complete responses containing 
authentic data.  The rest could not because they simply did not support the OPT RR 
needed to indicate DNSSEC-awareness. 
Source Port Randomization 
This test exercises the underlying Network Address Translation/Port Translation (NAT-
PT) algorithms in the router/firewall. 
We added this to our test methodology in light of the DNS vulnerability announced by 
Dan Kaminsky on July 8th 2008 and subsequent concerns that NAT-PT systems could 
undermine any source port randomization used by DNS servers located behind (inside) 
the router/firewall. 
We tested for UDP source port randomization by running a local recursive DNS resolver 
on the LAN side of the unit under test, and then running the public port checker tests 
available at http://www.doxpara.com and https://www.dns-oarc.net/oarc/services/porttest 
Half of the units tested have poor source port selection algorithms, with most of those 
picking sequential UDP source ports. 
Because this is a security vulnerability that could potentially be exploited (rather than an 
EDNS0 or DNSSEC support issue) we will not disclose here which units are affected 
until the vendors have had an opportunity to resolve those (e.g. via firmware updates).  
However, our findings demonstrate that broadband consumers should be encouraged to 
update factory-default firmware as vendors fix this highly-publicized vulnerability. Doing 
so could lead consumers to install upgrades that improve DNSSEC support as well. 
3.3 General Observations 
No router/firewall passed every single test.  Several (6) did, however, pass every test 
apart from the TCP test.  Such products facilitate DNSSEC deployment by avoiding 
adverse impact on broadband consumers. 
One firewall was essentially transparent to DNSSEC because it does not proxy DNS at 
all.  Only those units that proxy DNS or inspect application layer content are likely to 
interfere with DNSSEC processing in any way. 
All tested proxies appear to be DNS forwarders. However, we found that "simple” 
proxies were less likely to impede DNSSEC interaction between clients and upstream 
security-aware resolvers.  Proxies that blindly copied AD/CD/DO flags fared well in our 
DNSSEC tests, while proxies that actively participated in DNS application processing 
were more impacted by DNSSEC. Specifically: 
•  One proxy that operated as a caching forwarder cached all SOA records returned 
by test queries, irrespective of zone TTL. That proxy incorrectly served later 
DNSSEC queries from its cache, returning the SOA but not associated RRSIGs.  
We circumvented this by querying TXT records instead of SOAs.

Test Report: DNSSEC Impact on Broadband Routers and Firewalls 
•  Another proxy that operated as a caching forwarder generated UDP queries and 
then failed over to TCP queries for every response over 512 bytes – no matter 
which protocol the client used.  As a result, retrieving a lengthy DNSSEC domain 
required twice as many queries (UDP failure, followed by TCP) and the client had 
no way to avoid this. 
•  One firewall failed every proxy test because it put the upstream resolver's IP 
address on all response packets forwarded through the proxy!  Because most 
clients reject DNS responses received from unexpected sources (see RFC 
2181), this unit's otherwise error-free DNSSEC support was a moot point. 
As expected, we found more feature diversity in SOHO firewalls than residential routers. 
In fact, our SOHO firewall sample size is really too small to draw broad conclusions 
about SOHO products. Nonetheless, we offer these observations: 
•  Most tested SOHO firewalls required explicit configuration of DHCP and DNS 
settings and did not operate in proxy mode by default. Because these products 
routed DNSSEC to upstream resolvers by default, fewer consumers are likely to 
be impacted by SOHO firewall proxy support or non-support of DNSSEC. 
•  A growing number of SOHO firewalls now provide deep packet inspection and/or 
application layer proxies, typically packaged as "unified threat management" 
options.  We tested two SOHO firewalls with and without these UTM options 
enabled.  Neither objected to DNSSEC flags or RRs used in our test queries and 
responses, although one did generate "possible reconnaissance" alerts. Further 
testing would be needed to assess this potential impact. 
As described in Section 2.2, we used commands that were based on earlier .SE testing, 
refined to make it easier to determine which capability (or lack thereof) caused a given 
test to fail. As such, our results are not directly comparable to .SE test results. However, 
we can offer some general comparisons: 
•  Like .SE, we found near total absence of TCP and many EDNS0 limitations. 
•  We also found that 27% of proxies could not convey the DNSSEC OK flag. 
•  However, only two tested proxies blocked requests containing the AD flag. 
•  We did not experience as many failure results because we did not run as many 
tests over TCP or over UDP with expected responses > 512 bytes.

4. Conclusions 
All 24 units could successfully route DNSSEC queries addressed directly to an upstream 
resolver. DNS clients could send DNSSEC queries and receive signed responses of any 
length when units were reconfigured to operate in this fashion. 
However, most units operate as DNS proxies by default, almost always over UDP. This 
is how most broadband consumers will experience DNSSEC. When we combine our 
DNSSEC results with UDP/EDNS0 results for the 22 units that successfully proxy DNS 
(i.e., passed our baseline test), we find that: 
•  4 proxies could retrieve DNSSEC-enabled responses up to 4096 bytes 
(the max buffer size implemented by most servers, including ISC BIND) 
•  6 proxies could only retrieve DNSSEC responses that fit in one IP packet 
•  6 proxies could only retrieve DNSSEC responses that fit in one RFC1035 packet 
•  6 proxies blocked "DNSSEC OK" requests and/or validated responses entirely
