User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题enable binlog in MySQL on Ubuntu How can I enable binlog in mysql? The documents say to start the server with --log-bin but when I do:

service mysql start --log-bin=/binlog


I get:

start: invalid option: --log-bin=/binlog


And when I add

log-bin = /binlog


to /etc/mysql/my.cnf it doesn't log anything.

Assistant: "service mysql start" won't accept mysql-specific options, since that's a command of the init system. You would need to pass the --log-bin to mysqld. But you should prefer specifying that in the config file ;-)

add in the [mysqld] stanza of my.cnf

log-bin = /path/to/log


and maybe:

expire-logs-days = 14
max-binlog-size  = 500M
server-id        = 1


and beware that the specified file+path must be writable by the mysql user! Your example specified /binlog. The mysql user ist surely not allowed to write files in /. You may specify a relative path like log-bin=binlog which will then create a file called binlog inside your MySQL data directory where permissions are already set up.
