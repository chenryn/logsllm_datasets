User: If there is a problem of unbalanced database reading and writing, how to optimize it under the premise of ensuring system performance?
Assistant: 1. Database read and write separation: separate read and write operations, and use technologies such as master-slave replication or distributed databases to distribute read requests and write requests to different servers for processing, avoiding competition between read and write operations for a database, and reducing single Database load. 2. Database cache: You can use cache technology (such as Redis, Memcached) to store frequently accessed data in the cache, reduce the number of visits to the database, and improve system response speed. 3. Horizontal database splitting: Distribute data into multiple databases according to certain rules, realize data horizontal splitting, and avoid excessive load of a single database. 4. Use indexes: Creating indexes can speed up the query speed of the database, reduce system load, and reduce query time consumption. 5. Optimize SQL statements: Optimizing SQL statements can improve database performance and shorten query time. 6. Database cluster: Using database cluster technology, multiple servers can jointly process access requests, improve system throughput and reliability, and achieve the purpose of balancing read and write loads.
