7. Conclusions
20 of 23
Current access control models provide a static way to provide access decisions for various
applications. However, an access control model for a dynamic and distributed system should rely on
contextual and real-time data. With billions of sensors and devices in our environment, contextual
information can be collected and utilized in the access control process, which can provide what is called
dynamic access control models. One of these dynamic models is the risk-based access control model.
This model is capable of providing the access decision dynamically by estimating the security risk value
associated with the access request. The risk-based access control model can provide several beneﬁts
for several trending technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, etc. This paper presented a systematic
literature review and analysis of the state-of-the-art of the risk-based access control model to provide a
detailed understanding of the topic. Based on the selected search strategy, 44 articles (of 1044 articles)
were chosen for a closer examination in terms of recent risk-based models, risk factors, and risk
estimation techniques. The results provided a summarized version of selected articles to give the reader
a basic view of diﬀerent risk-based access control models from the perspective of various researchers.
Although there are several risk factors that can be applied in various contexts—for example, risk
history, which was adopted in 18 publications—the results show that risk factors used to implement
risk-based access control models are signiﬁcantly based on the context/domain. In addition, the results
demonstrated that providing an eﬃcient and accurate risk estimation technique that can be applied
in diﬀerent domains is one of the major issues of implementing risk-based access control models.
Although some risk estimation approaches can work well such as decision tree, the lack of a dataset to
represent the likelihood and impact of each risk scenario in a speciﬁc context is the key problem.
