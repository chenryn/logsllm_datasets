## Abstract
Workload characterization is crucial for understanding how systems and services are used in practice and for identifying design improvements. To better understand the longitudinal workload dynamics of chunk-based content delivery systems, this paper analyzes BitTorrent usage from two different vantage points. Using two simultaneously collected 48-week long traces, we analyze the differences in download characteristics and popularity dynamics observed locally at a university campus versus at a global scale. We find that campus users typically download larger files and are early adopters of new content, downloading files well before their global popularity peaks. The exception is music files, which campus users tend to download later. We also observe high churn in the set of popular files each week, both locally and globally, with the most popular files peaking significantly later than their release date. These findings provide insights that may improve the efficiency of local content sharing and increase the scalability of the global system.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet is heavily used for content delivery, and many scalable delivery techniques have been proposed to reduce costs. One promising approach is to split large files into smaller chunks, allowing clients to download these chunks in parallel from servers and/or other clients (i.e., peers). While this chunk-based approach has proven highly effective, managing large-scale content replication systems remains a challenge. This is partly due to the difficulty in measuring and understanding the relationships between workloads observed in different parts of the network.

To address this, this paper analyzes BitTorrent usage as observed both locally and globally. BitTorrent is the original and most successful chunk-based protocol. Despite some legal challenges, it still accounts for a significant fraction of Internet traffic.

We measure BitTorrent content popularity over a 48-week period from two different vantage points: passive measurements at a large university campus and active measurements by scraping 721 unique BitTorrent trackers. Our analysis is the first longitudinal multi-torrent study, capturing the differences in download characteristics and popularity dynamics of a large set of files observed both locally and globally. Notably, there is a significant overlap in the files observed in both datasets, with 93.1% of the files downloaded on campus also appearing in the globally collected tracker-based dataset.

Key findings include:
- Campus users typically download larger files, particularly movies and TV shows.
- They download files well before the global popularity peaks, except for music files, which they adopt later.
- There is high churn in the set of popular files each week, both locally and globally.
- Most popular files peak well after their initial release, contrasting with flash crowd models.

These insights can inform strategies for local content caching, improving user experience and system scalability.

## 2. Related Work
Many studies have examined P2P content popularity, focusing on characteristics over fixed time intervals, such as the number of downloads or concurrent peers in swarms. Some studies used local measurements at ISPs or university campuses, while others used global measurements through search requests or tracker scrapes. Most studies show that content popularity follows Zipf-like distributions.

Other studies have looked at the performance dynamics of individual swarms over time, either based on global or local content popularity. These studies suggest that typical swarms stop growing soon after introduction, but some continue to grow after major flash crowds.

Content popularity has also been studied in other contexts, such as Web objects, user-generated content, and on-demand streaming media. Temporal evolution of popularity has been analyzed for social media.

Our work is the first to compare temporal popularity dynamics as observed locally and globally for a content distribution system, using comprehensive measurement datasets.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 BitTorrent Overview
BitTorrent splits content into small chunks, which can be downloaded from other peers. Volunteer trackers maintain state information about peers sharing specific files. Peers contact trackers to learn about other peers and must periodically update the tracker with their status.

Peers typically learn about trackers by downloading .torrent files from Web servers or torrent search engines. In this paper, we leverage protocol specifications to capture information communicated to trackers in peer-to-tracker communication.

### 3.2 University Campus Measurements
Our first dataset is a trace of all non-encrypted peer-to-tracker communication at the University of Calgary, collected between September 15, 2008, and August 17, 2009. The data were collected using a Bro script that extracts application-layer information about HTTP transactions in real-time.

We focus on peer-to-tracker HTTP requests, which can be identified by URIs containing "peerID" and "info hash." These URIs also provide information on the amount of content downloaded and uploaded. We track file sharing progress as reported to different trackers. Our anonymized traces do not allow us to identify individual users across downloads, but we found that most downloads were associated with recent versions of Vuze (52.78%) and µTorrent (23.7%) clients. Other common clients included Transmission (10.6%), the mainline client (5.7%), and BitComet (4.2%). Up to 97.5% of the downloads may have been done by peers implementing the peer-exchange protocol (PEX) and DHT functionality.

### 3.3 Global Tracker-Based Measurements
Our second dataset provides a global view of content popularity, obtained through two types of measurements: screen scrapes of the torrent search engine Mininova.org and weekly scrapes of 721 unique BitTorrent trackers. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of torrent popularity.
