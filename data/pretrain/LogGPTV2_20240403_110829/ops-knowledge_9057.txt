User: How to implement a single sign-on (SSO) solution?
Assistant: single sign-on (SSO) solution can be implemented through the following steps: 1. Configure the authentication service: Set up an authentication service that is responsible for verifying the user's identity. This service can use existing standard authentication protocols such as OAuth, SAML or OpenID Connect. 2. Authentication service registration: Register each application server with the identity authentication service so that it can check the user's login status. 3. User login: The user authenticates in one of the applications, and the application sends their login information to the authentication service for verification. 4. Token creation: After the authentication service authenticates the user, it issues a token to the user and sends it back to the application for subsequent use. 5. Token verification: When users log in to other applications, they can verify their identity by checking the token without re-authentication. 6. Token expiration processing: When the token expires, the authentication service will detect the expiration and notify all logged-in applications. These applications can re-authenticate by calling the authentication service, and then issue new tokens. In summary, a single sign-on (SSO) solution enables user authentication and token issuance through an identity service and registers the application with the service for a unified token verification process.
