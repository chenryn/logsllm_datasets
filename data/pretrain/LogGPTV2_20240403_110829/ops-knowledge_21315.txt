Assistant: This log chunk shows the connection and disconnection of various clients to a server. It begins with two clients being disconnected due to not having established a session. Then, two new clients are accepted and a session is established for one of them. Later, another client is accepted and another session is established. After that, a client is dropped due to the server being in read-only mode. Two more clients are accepted and a session is established for one of them. Finally, one client is disconnected due to an end of stream exception.
