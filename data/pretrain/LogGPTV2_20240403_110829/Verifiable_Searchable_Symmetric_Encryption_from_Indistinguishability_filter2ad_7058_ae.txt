6 Conclusion and future works
Auditing task is of paramount importance in cloud computing. To provide search services with
this feature, publicly veriﬁable SSE was introduced and some constructions were presented.
Public veriﬁability makes auditing task possible by allowing any entity to verify the search
process on the remote server without access to the private information.
Our results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The proposed PV-SKS constructions are
the ﬁrst SKS schemes with public veriﬁability based on well-studied primitives which can
also be used as building blocks in the other schemes to provide them with public veriﬁability.
PV-SKS1 is not as efﬁcient as PV-SKS2, but it has a good ﬂexibility letting it to be used
for more complex queries. Compared to the OXT construction, the proposed SSE schemes
provide public veriﬁability which comes at the cost of either number of rounds (PV-SSE1)
or higher search complexity (PV-SSE2).
As future works, the overhead on the client side for producing the veriﬁcation keys can
be improved. This improvement makes the idea of veriﬁcation as a service more accessible.

Appendix A: Background
A.1: Basic primitives and assumptions
Decision Difﬁe-Hellman Assumption. Let G be a prime order cyclic group of order p with
generator g. We say that the decision Difﬁe-Hellman (DDH) assumption holds in G if for all
P.P.T adversaries A there exists a negligible function negl such that:
(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8) Pr[A(g, ga, gb, gab) = 1] − Pr[A(g, ga , gb, gc) = 1]
(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8) ≤ negl(λ),
where the probability is over the randomness of A and uniformly chosen a, b, c from Z∗
p.
Deﬁnition 9 (CPA-Secure Symmetric Encryption Scheme [20]) For any symmetric encryp-
tion scheme Π = (Gen, Enc, Dec) the following game is deﬁned.
SymKcpaA,Π (λ): A key K is generated by running Gen(1λ). The adversary A is given input
1λ and oracle access to Enc(K , .) and outputs a pair of messages m0, m1 of the same length.
A uniform bit b ∈ {0, 1} is chosen, and then a ciphertext c ← Enc(K , mb) is computed and
given to A. The adversary A continues to have oracle access to Enc(K , .), and outputs a bit
(cid:8) = b, and 0
(cid:8)
. The output of the game denoted by SymKcpaA,Π (λ), is deﬁned to be 1 if b
b
otherwise.
We say that Π is CPA-secure, if for all P.P.T adversaries A there is a negligible function
negl such that
Pr[SymKcpaA,Π (λ) = 1] ≤ 1
2
+ negl(λ).
Deﬁnition 10 (Second-Preimage Resistant Hash Function) A second-preimage resistant
hash function (with output length l) is a hash function H : {0, 1}∗ → {0, 1}l if for all
P.P.T adversaries A there is a negligible function negl such that:
Pr[x ← {0, 1}∗, x
(cid:8) ← A(x ) : x
(cid:8) (cid:11)= x , H (x
(cid:8)) = H (x )] ≤ negl(λ).
Deﬁnition 11 (Pseudo-Random Function) Let Func[n, m] be the set of all functions from
{0, 1}n to {0, 1}m. A function F : {0, 1}λ × {0, 1}n → {0, 1}m is pseudo-random if it is
computable in polynomial time (in λ) and if for all P.P.T adversaries A there is a negligible
function negl such that:
(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8) ≤ negl(λ).
(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8) Pr[K ← {0, 1}λ : AF (K ,.)(λ) = 1] − Pr[g ← Func[n, m] : Ag(.)(λ) = 1]
If F is bijective then it is a pseudo-random permutation.
Deﬁnition 12 (Strong One-Way Function) A function g : {0, 1}∗ → {0, 1}∗
is a strong one-
way function if it is computable in polynomial time (in λ) and if for all P.P.T adversaries A
there exists a negligible function negl such that for any input length n = n(λ),
Pr[x ← {0, 1}n, y ← g(x ) : g(A(1n, y)) = y] ≤ negl(λ).
A.2: Signature scheme
The correctness and security of a signature scheme are deﬁned as follows.
123
Publicly veriﬁable SSE
145
Deﬁnition 13 (Correctness [20]) A signature scheme Γ = (Gen, Sign, Vrfy) is correct if
except with negligible probability over ( pk, sk) output by Gen(1λ), it holds that
Vrfy( pk, m, Sign(sk, m)) = 1 for every message m.
Deﬁnition 14 (Security [20]) Let Γ = (Gen, Sign, Vrfy) be a signature scheme, and con-
sider the following experiment for an adversary A:
ForgeΓA(λ): Gen(1λ) is run to obtain keys ( pk, sk). The adversary A is given pk and
access to the oracle Sign(sk, .). The adversary then outputs (m, σ ). Let q denote the set of
all queries that A asked its oracle. The output of the experiment, denoted by ForgeΓA(λ), is
deﬁned to be 1, if and only if (1) Vrfy( pk, m, σ ) = 1 and (2) m /∈ q.
We say the signature scheme Γ is existentially unforgeable under an adaptive chosen-
message attack, or just secure, if for all P.P.T adversaries A, there is a negligible function
negl such that:
Pr[ForgeΓA(λ) = 1] ≤ negl(λ).
A.3: TSet scheme
Deﬁnition 15 (Correctness [8]) For the adversaryA and a TSet scheme Σ = (Setup, GetTag,
Retrieve), the following game is deﬁned.
ComCorΣA(λ): A(1λ) chooses T , the game generates (T Set, K ) ← Setup(T ), gives
T Set to A. Then the adversary adaptively chooses keywords w. For each query w from the
adversary, the game generates tg ← GetTag(K , w) and tw ← Retrieve(T Set, tg). The
game outputs 1 if in any execution the server outputs tw (cid:11)= T[w], and 0 otherwise. The
output of the game is denoted by the random variable ComCorΣA(λ).
We say that a TSet scheme Σ is computationally correct if for all P.P.T adversaries A
there exists a negligible function negl such that:
Pr[ComCorΣA(λ) = 1] ≤ negl(λ).
Deﬁnition 16 (Adaptive-Security [8]) Let Σ = (Setup, GetTag, Retrieve) be a TSet
scheme andLT be a stateful algorithm. For the adversaryA and the simulatorS, two following
games are deﬁned.
RealΣA(λ): A(1λ) outputs T . The game runs (T Set, K ) ← Setup(T ) and gives T Set
to A. Then A adaptively chooses keywords w. For each w from the adversary, the game
gives tg ← GetTag(K , w) to A. Eventually A outputs a bit which the game uses as its
output denoted by RealΣA(λ).
SimΣA(λ): The game initializes a counter i = 0 and an empty list q. A(1λ) outputs T .
to A. Then A adaptively chooses
The game runs T Set
keywords w, and for each w the game stores w in q[i], increments i, and gives A the
output of S(LT (T , q)). Eventually, A outputs a bit which the game uses as its output
denoted by SimΣA(λ).
∗ ← S(LT (T )) and gives T Set
∗
We say that Σ is a LT -adaptively-secure if for all P.P.T adversariesA there exists an algorithm
S such that:
| Pr[RealΣA(λ) = 1] − Pr[SimΣA(λ) = 1]| ≤ negl(λ).
