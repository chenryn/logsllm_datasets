User: I have just written a python script to do some batch file operations. I was wondering how i could keep it in some common path like rest of the command line utilities like cd, ls, grep etc.
What i expect is something like this to be done from any directory -
$ script.py arg1 arg2
Assistant: Just put the script directory into the PATH environment variable, or alternatively put the script in a location that is already in the PATH. On Unix systems, you usually use /home/<nick>/bin for your own scripts and add that to the PATH.
