##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
Templating
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    1.8.2
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A (but rhel7)
##### SUMMARY
When entering passwords for login/sudo, they are parsed by the templater
instead of being used literally. This creates unexpected behaviour - for
example, with a password that contains a '{':
    $ ansible -i "testhost1," all -k -m ping
    SSH password:
    testhost1 | FAILED => template error while templating string: unexpected token 'eof' 
    $
If the substring in the password were valud template syntax we'd just get
'invalid password' errors, which would be even more confusing.  
There is potential for destructive behaviour and - while very minor -
potential security concerns by use of a malicious password (I don't have a
specific example, but in places with esoteric security implementations one
could see this being exploitable).
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
  * Set password on remote host '123abc{'
  * Attempt ansible run with -k
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Successfully authenticates against remote host and runs my command
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Connecting to host host fails with 'error while templating string'
    SSH password:
    testhost1 | FAILED => template error while templating string: unexpected token 'eof'
