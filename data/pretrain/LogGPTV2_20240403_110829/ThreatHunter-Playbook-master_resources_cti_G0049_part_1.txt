# G0049: OilRig

## Description
OilRig, a suspected Iranian threat group, has been active since at least 2014, primarily targeting organizations in the Middle East and internationally. The group has targeted various industries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications. OilRig is known to conduct supply chain attacks, leveraging the trust relationships between organizations to reach their primary targets. FireEye's assessment suggests that the group operates on behalf of the Iranian government, based on infrastructure details, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests.

This group was previously tracked under two distinct names, APT34 and OilRig, but has been combined due to additional reporting that provided higher confidence about the overlap in their activities.
