### Targeting Types and Explanations

To address the issues with targeting types, we recruited several hundred participants and focused on comparing different targeting types and explanations. Our results were interpreted accordingly. We observed that more detailed explanations were less readable, potentially leading participants to skim through them. To better understand participant preferences, we conducted a broad exploration of the design space. A key finding was the trade-off between readability and comprehensiveness, which future work should address.

### 4. Results

#### 4.1 Characterization of Current Ad-Targeting Practices

In this section, we first characterize current ad-targeting practices by analyzing the Twitter data of our 231 participants. We then report their reactions to various targeting mechanisms and six potential ad explanations from our online survey. We identified 30 different targeting types, some with thousands of unique instances. Participants' perceptions of fairness, comfort, and desirability varied significantly by type. However, comfort and desirability generally increased with the perceived accuracy of the targeting. Additionally, all three ad explanations we designed (based on existing literature) outperformed the explanations currently used on Twitter and Facebook.

#### 4.2 Participant Demographics

We analyzed data from 231 participants who uploaded their Twitter data, completed all parts of the study, and provided on-topic responses to free-response prompts. The participants had been on Twitter for an average of 6.6 years, with a range from 1 month to 12.3 years. Two-thirds of the participants reported spending less than an hour per day on Twitter. Among the participants, 52.8% identified as female, 84.0% had at least some college education, and 20.8% had a background in computer science or IT. On average, participants recognized only 1.6 companies (out of a random sample of 10) that had shown them ads in the past 90 days. Interestingly, over 50 participants reported reviewing their files before the survey, though this is unlikely to have biased their responses given the large number of files and ad-impressions.js files containing per-ad data.

#### 4.3 Aggregate Overview of Targeting

Participants had an average of 1,046.6 ads in their files, ranging from 1 to 14,035. Collectively, the 231 participants' data files contained 240,651 ads, each targeted with at least one of the 30 different targeting types, with 45,209 unique instances.

**Usage of Targeting Types:**
- The most commonly used types were location (99.2% of all ads) and age (72.3%).
- The least commonly used type was flexible audience lookalikes (0.2%).
- Language, age, and gender targeting always used one instance per ad.
- Follower lookalikes and keywords often employed multiple instances, averaging 6.0 and 4.9 instances per ad, respectively.
- The largest set observed was 158 behavior instances.

**Unique Instances:**
- For nine targeting types, fewer than ten unique instances were observed.
- Keywords (25,745), follower lookalikes (8,792), and tailored lists (2,338) had the most unique instances across participants.
- Many participants encountered dozens or hundreds of unique instances of each type.

#### 4.4 Detailed Usage of Targeting Types

We detail the usage of each targeting type, grouping them into three clusters based on the source of the underlying data: demographic, psychographic, and advertiser-provided.

##### 4.4.1 Twitter Demographic Targeting Types

**Characteristics:**
- **Language:** English was the most frequently targeted language (208 participants).
- **Age:** Age targeting was common but coarse, with "18 and up" being the most frequent (83.11% of participants).
- **Location:** The top five locations were the US, UK, Los Angeles, London, and Chicago. Some ads were targeted to multiple, non-overlapping locations, indicating changes in Twitter location over time.
- **Gender:** Gender targeting was less frequent, with almost 70% of instances targeting women. Twitter infers gender if not provided, and this inference can change over time.
- **Device Data:** Platform, OS version, device model, and carrier were also used for targeting. iOS and desktop platforms were the most frequently targeted, and T-Mobile and O2 were the most common carriers.

##### 4.4.2 Twitter Psychographic Targeting Types

**Characteristics:**
- **Twitter Activity:** Followers of a user ID, keywords, and conversation topics were among the most frequently used psychographic targeting types.
- **Keywords:** Ranged from broad terms like "technology" and "food" to specific ones like "first home" and "idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura."
- **Conversation Topics:** Inferred from users' Twitter activity, with the top five topics being "technology," "food," "travel," "soccer," and "fashion."
- **Interests:** Inferred from followed accounts and direct activities, with top interests including "comedy," "tech news," and "music festivals and concerts."
- **Events and Entertainment:** Targeted based on both direct activities and inferences, with sports events and popular TV shows being the most common.
- **Follower Lookalikes:** Targeted users sharing interests or demographics with followers of a particular account, despite not following it.
