targeting type. To account for these issues, we recruited sev-
eral hundred participants and focused on comparisons among
targeting types and explanations, interpreting our results ac-
cordingly. Additionally, the more detailed explanations were
less readable, and participants may have been more likely to
skim them. We performed a broad exploration of the design
space in an eﬀort to understand what features participants
liked and disliked. There is a trade-oﬀ between readability
and comprehensiveness that future work should address.

In this section, we ﬁrst characterize current ad-targeting prac-
tices by analyzing our 231 participants’ Twitter data. We then
report participants’ reactions to targeting mechanisms as well
as to six potential ad explanations from our online survey.
We observed 30 diﬀerent targeting types in use, some with
thousands of unique instances. Participants’ perceptions of
fairness, comfort, and desirability diﬀered starkly by type,
but comfort and desirability generally increased with the per-
ceived accuracy of the targeting. Further, all three ad expla-
nations we designed (based on the literature) outperformed
explanations currently deployed on Twitter and Facebook.
4.1 Participants
We report on data from the 231 participants who uploaded
their Twitter data, completed all parts of the study, and wrote
on-topic answers to free-response prompts. Our participants
had been on Twitter for between 1 month and 12.3 years, with
an average of 6.6 years. Two-thirds of participants reported
spending under an hour a day on Twitter. Among participants,
52.8% identiﬁed as female, 84.0% reported at least some col-
lege education, and 20.8% percent reported some background
in computer science or IT. When asked early in the survey,
participants only recognized an average of 1.6 companies
(min: 0, max: 8) out of a random sample of 10 companies that
had shown them ads in the past 90 days. Interestingly, more
than 50 participants reported looking at their ﬁles before the
survey. Although this may have biased participants regarding
speciﬁc ads shown, this is unlikely given both the large num-
ber of ﬁles found in the original data download and the large
size of the ad-impressions.js ﬁles containing per-ad data.
Participants would have had to parse many blocks like the one
in Appendix A [1] and particularly notice the speciﬁc ones
we asked about.
4.2 Aggregate Overview of Targeting
Participants had an average of 1046.6 ads in their ﬁles (min:
1, max: 14,035); a full histogram of ad impressions is shown
in Appendix H, Figure 8 [1]. Our 231 participants’ data ﬁles
collectively contained 240,651 ads that had been targeted with
at least one targeting type. As detailed in Table 1, we observed
30 diﬀerent targeting types, with 45,209 unique instances of
those targeting types.
Usage of the diﬀerent targeting types varied greatly, as
shown in Figure 3 (left). The most commonly used types
were location (99.2% of all ads) and age (72.3%). The least
commonly used was flexible audience lookalikes (0.2%). A
single ad could be targeted using multiple instances of a given
type, but Language, age, and gender targeting always used
one instance. In contrast, follower lookalikes and keywords
often employed multiple instances: 6.0 and 4.9 instances on
average per ad, respectively. The largest set we observed was
158 behavior instances. Figure 3 (center) shows how often
multiple instances were used to target a given ad.
For nine targeting types, we observed fewer than ten unique
instances (e.g., male and female were the only two gender
instances). In contrast, keywords (25,745), follower looka-
likes (8,792), and tailored lists (2,338) had the most unique
instances across participants. For many targeting types, the

median participant encountered dozens or hundreds of unique
instances of that type, as shown in Figure 3 (right).
4.3 Detailed Usage of Targeting Types
Next, we detail how each targeting type was used to target ads
to our participants. Based on the source of the data underlying
each type, we grouped the targeting types into three clusters.
The ﬁrst two clusters — targeting types related to user demo-
graphics and targeting types related to user psychographics
(behaviors and interests) — use information collected directly
by Twitter. In contrast, the third cluster consists of targeting
types using data provided by prospective advertisers.
4.3.1 Twitter Demographic Targeting Types
The ﬁrst of our three clusters consists of demographic-based
targeting. We include in this category characteristics about
both a person and their device(s). Sometimes, users directly
provide this information to Twitter (e.g., providing a birth
date upon registration). In other cases, Twitter infers this data.
Advertisers commonly used demographics to target
broad audiences. Language was used frequently, with En-
glish being the most popularly targeted (208 participants).
Age targeting was also extremely common, yet also used
coarsely (only 23 unique instances). “18 and up” was the
most frequently targeted value; 83.11% of participants were
targeted on this attribute. Many age instances overlapped (e.g.,
“18 and up”, “18 to 24”, “18 to 34,” “18 to 49”). The ﬁve most
frequently observed locations were the US, UK, Los Angeles,
London, and Chicago. We also observed locations as granular
as ZIP codes (e.g., 44805 for Ashland, OH). Diﬀerent ads
for a single participant were sometimes targeted to multiple,
non-overlapping locations, demonstrating that their Twitter
location changed over time. Gender targeting was much less
frequently used than language, age, or location. Almost 70%
of gender instances targeted women. The README.txt ﬁle
accompanying data downloads says that Twitter infers a user’s
gender if they did not provide it; our analysis (and others [44])
support this assertion. We also found that this inference may
change over time: 19.9% were targeted as male in some ads
and female in others.
Twitter also collects data about users’ devices for tar-
geting [67]. Platform was used to target ads to users of iOS
(115 participants), desktop (115), and Android (98). In total
14,605 ads were targeted to iOS users, while 8,863 were tar-
geted to Android users. The most frequently targeted device
models were the iPhone 8, Galaxy Note 9, iPhone 8 Plus,
and iPhone 7. Participants were often associated with multi-
ple instances (e.g., both Android Lollipop and Jelly Bean) or
even targeted cross-OS (e.g., both Android Marshmallow and
iOS 12.4). Twitter also oﬀers targeting of Twitter users on a
new device; 62.6% of the 243 instances we observed were to
devices Twitter designated as 1 month old (as opposed to 2,
3, or 6 months). Advertisers also targeted by carrier, most
commonly to T-Mobile (21 participants) and O2 (19).
4.3.2 Twitter Psychographic Targeting Types
We next discuss targeting types related to participants’ psy-
chographic attributes, which users provide via Twitter activity
or which are inferred by Twitter’s algorithms. Psychographic
attributes relate to a user’s lifestyle, behavioral, or attitudinal
propensities [26]. Although “behavioral targeting” is com-
monly used in industry and research as an umbrella term for
all forms of psychographic targeting, we describe the range
of targeting based on user behaviors and attitudes as psycho-
graphic, in contrast to the speciﬁc behavior targeting type
oﬀered by Twitter. While some participants may be aware
of the inferences that could be made about them from their
Twitter activity, many likely are not [73] .
Some of the most frequently used psychographic tar-
geting types are based directly on users’ Twitter activity.
Followers of a user id, which targets all followers of the same
Twitter account, was used 590,502 times in our data. Out of
the ﬁve of the most commonly targeted values, four were re-
lated to news agencies: @WSJ, @nytimes, @TheEconomist,
@washingtonpost, and @BillGates. Keywords, which are se-
lected by advertisers and approved by Twitter [65], was the
most unique targeting type, with a total of 25,745 distinct

Table 1: Targeting types observed in our 231 participants’
Twitter data. We report how many of the 240,651 ads were
targeted by that type, as well as the number of unique instances
of that type and the most frequently observed instance. We
group targeting types by their source (advertisers or Twitter).

instances. Keywords varied greatly in content and speciﬁcity,
ranging from “technology” and “food” to “ﬁrst home” (used
by realtor.com) and “idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura”
(used by WEGO Health). We identiﬁed several keywords as
potentially violating Twitter policies prohibiting targeting to
sensitive categories “such as race, religion, politics, sex life,
or health,” [65, 69]. Examples include “ostomy”, “Gay”, and
“latinas” (see Table 2 for more). Twitter infers conversation
topic instances based on users’ Twitter activity (Tweets, clicks,
etc.), allowing advertisers to target narrow populations: about
a third of our unique conversation instances were in only
one user’s ad data. The top ﬁve topics, however, were broad:
“technology,” “food,” “travel,” “soccer,” and “fashion.”
Inferences made for interests targeting are one step
more abstract; they are inferred from the accounts a user
follows (and the content from those accounts) as well as their
direct activities. The top ﬁve interests were similar to the
top ﬁve conversation topics: “comedy,” “tech news,” “tech-
nology,” “music festivals and concerts,” and “soccer.” Other
targeted interests were more speciﬁc, such as “vintage cars”
and “screenwriting.”
Similarly to interests, the event and movies and TV shows
targeting types appear to rely on both a user’s direct activities
and on inferences to label users as interested in oﬄine events
and entertainment. These targeting types most commonly
reﬂected sports (“2019 Women’s World Cup,” 2,713 instances;
“MLB Season 2019,” 1,344 instances) and popular shows such
as “Love Island,” “Stranger Things,” and “Game of Thrones.”
Highly targeted psychographic targeting types are
based on Twitter algorithms. Follower Lookalikes target-
ing is even more indirect: the targeted users are labeled as
sharing interests or demographics with followers of a par-
ticular account, despite not actually following that account.
Follower lookalikes is the second most individualized target-
