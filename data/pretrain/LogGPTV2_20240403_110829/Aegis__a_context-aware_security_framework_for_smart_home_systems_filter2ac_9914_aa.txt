ABSTRACT
Our everyday lives are expanding fast with the introduction of new
Smart Home Systems (SHSs). Today, a myriad of SHS devices and
applications are widely available to users and have already started
to re-define our modern lives. Smart home users utilize the apps to
control and automate such devices. Users can develop their own
apps or easily download and install them from vendor-specific app
markets. App-based SHSs offer many tangible benefits to our lives,
but also unfold diverse security risks. Several attacks have already
been reported for SHSs. However, current security solutions con-
sider smart home devices and apps individually to detect malicious
actions rather than the context of the SHS as a whole. The existing
mechanisms cannot capture user activities and sensor-device-user
interactions in a holistic fashion. To address these issues, in this pa-
per, we introduce Aegis, a novel context-aware security framework
to detect malicious behavior in a SHS. Specifically, Aegis observes
the states of the connected smart home entities (sensors and de-
vices) for different user activities and usage patterns in a SHS and
builds a contextual model to differentiate between malicious and
benign behavior. We evaluated the efficacy and performance of
Aegis in multiple smart home settings (i.e., single bedroom, dou-
ble bedroom, duplex) with real-life users performing day-to-day
activities and real SHS devices. We also measured the performance
of Aegis against five different malicious behaviors. Our detailed
evaluation shows that Aegis can detect malicious behavior in SHS
with high accuracy (over 95%) and secure the SHS regardless of
the smart home layout, device configuration, installed apps, and
enforced user policies. Finally, Aegis achieves minimum overhead
in detecting malicious behavior in SHS, ensuring easy deployability
in real-life smart environments.

1 INTRODUCTION
The capabilities of the smart home devices have evolved from
merely controlling lights and opening garage doors to connecting
our living spaces to the cyber world [9, 20, 33]. Such functionality
provides more autonomous, efficient, and convenient daily oper-
ations [12]. For instance, sensor-activated lights offer energy effi-
ciency while smart locks and motion-activated cameras offer a more
secure home environment. Compared to early Smart Home Systems
(SHS) with fixed device setup procedures and limited functionalities,
modern SHSs have adopted a more user-centric, app-based model.
Similar to the smartphone ecosystem, SHS’s users can download
apps from the vendor’s app market and easily set up and control
the smart devices, which makes SHSs more popular and versatile
than ever [32].
The integration of programming platforms with smart home
devices surely enhances the functionalities of SHSs, but it also
exposes the vulnerabilities of the devices to the attackers. Attack-
ers can release malicious apps in third-party markets and public
repositories (e.g., GitHub) easily. Then, careless users can down-
load and utilize them for their devices. From here, the attackers
can exploit smart home devices in several ways: they can perform
denial-of-service attacks to obstruct normal operations of SHS [34],
they can compromise one device in SHS and get access to other
connected devices [11], they can even leak personal information
such as unlock code of a smart lock and gain physical access to the
home [6, 18]. Recently, a repository of malicious apps in different
smart home platforms has been published exhibiting several vulner-
abilities of the current smart home app development ecosystem [38].
Nonetheless, a security solution that detects these emerging threats
associated with SHSs does not exist and is direly needed.
Recent studies have proposed the implementation of enhanced
permission models for SHSs, which depends on specific user per-
mission [18] or the analysis the source code of the apps to detect
vulnerabilities, which is only effective against specific types of at-
tacks [6]. Moreover, existing solutions focus on the detection of
malicious activities that affect smart home devices and apps individ-
ually. However, a more holistic approach that also considers user
activity contexts and sensor-device-user interactions (e.g., move-
ment directions, sensors activated, rooms involved) is needed. For
example, if a user walks from the bedroom to the hallway, s/he

may activates multiple devices and sensors along his/her path (i.e.,
walking context) in a specific sequence: moving towards the bed-
room door, opening the door, entering the hallway, closing the door,
and reaching the hallway. A user cannot simply skip any of these
steps and reach the hallway directly from the bedroom. Again, de-
vice actions in a SHS are correlated with each other which can be
observed from a context-aware model. For example, a smart light
triggered by the motion sensor can be verified by checking the
user’s presence in the home using a presence sensor. A contextual
awareness of devices and applications that considers these types of
sensor-device-user interactions can provide valuable information
about malicious activities occurring in the SHSs, something that is
missing in current smart home solutions.
To address these emerging threats and shortcomings of SHSs, we
present Aegis, a novel context-aware security framework to detect
malicious behavior in a SHS. Aegis observes the changing patterns
of the conditions (active/inactive) of smart home entities (sensors
and devices) for different user activities and builds a contextual
model to detect malicious activities. Here, context-awareness refers
to the ability of Aegis to understand the changes in sensors and
devices’ states due to ongoing user activities and determine if the
behavior in the SHS is benign or not. Smart home devices are typ-
ically configured with different sensors to provide autonomous
control and uninterrupted operations. Thus, different sensors in
a SHS can sense user activities (motion, opening doors, etc.) and
trigger associated devices to perform pre-defined tasks. Aegis cor-
relates this sensor-device relation with different user activities and
builds a context-aware model to define benign user behavior. Aegis
also uses app context to understand the trigger-action scenarios be-
tween smart home entities (sensors and devices) and automatically
upgrades the framework if new devices are added to the SHS. As
a security framework, Aegis observes the current states (active or
inactive) of smart home sensors and devices and checks with the
learned user behavior to detect any malicious behavior. Specifically,
Aegis utilizes a Markov Chain-based machine learning technique to
detect malicious behavior. Additionally, Aegis uses an action man-
agement system to alert the users in the event of malicious behavior
and considers user responses to improve the context-aware model
for better accuracy (adaptive training mode). We tested Aegis in real
SHSs scenarios where 15 different users performed typical daily
activities in three different home layouts generating over 55000
sensor-device correlated events. Furthermore, we considered differ-
ent device settings (sensor-device relations), apps, and user policies
to evaluate the performance of Aegis against five different threats.
Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that Aegis can detect differ-
ent threats to SHS with high accuracy and F-score (over 95%). In
addition, Aegis achieves minimum overhead in terms of latency and
resource usage making Aegis compatible for real-life deployment.
Contributions: Our main contributions are noted as follows:
• Aegis. We present a novel context-aware security framework
to detect malicious activity in SHS. We capture sensor-device co-
dependence in smart home to understand the context of the user ac-
tivity and detect malicious behavior. Additionally, we implemented
an action management system to alert users about Aegis’s findings.
• User-specific configurations. We designed Aegis to support
different smart home layouts and configurations. Aegis allows easy

integration of new devices and apps creating app contexts and
reconfiguring the training data automatically. We also introduced
an adaptive training model to improve the detection mechanism
from user responses automatically.
• High accuracy and minimal overhead. Through a detailed
evaluation, we demonstrated how Aegis can detect different mali-
cious activities in a SHS. Our results show that Aegis can achieve
high accuracy and F-score and impose minimum overhead in the
system.
Organization: The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In
Section 2, we present the background information. Then, we discuss
the adversary model in Section 3. Section 4 details Aegis’s archi-
tecture and Section 5 evaluates the efficacy of Aegis in detecting
different malicious behavior in SHS. In Section 6 and Section 7, we
discuss how different types of users will be benefited by deploying
Aegis in real-life SHS and the related work, respectively. Finally,
Section 8 concludes the paper.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we describe the components of the SHS that we
assume for Aegis. We also detail different features used in Aegis to
detect different malicious activities in SHS. In Figure 1, a typical
architecture of a SHS is shown. A SHS has four basic building
blocks as shown in Figure 1. The first block of the SHS comprises
sensors and devices in the system. These smart home devices and
sensors are connected to each other via a smart hub. As there is
no generic interoperability standard among smart home devices,
the hub provides a common access point for all the entities in
the SHS. The hub is connected to both cloud backend service and
smartphone/tablet companion app. Users can use the smartphone
app to control the smart home entities or install different apps
from the app stores. Indeed, we can group SHS architectures in
two main categories: a cloud-based architecture where the installed
apps run in the cloud backend (e.g., SmartThings), and hub-based
architecture where the installed apps run the hub locally (e.g., Apple
HomeKit).
2.1 New Design Features Considered by Aegis
Context-awareness. Context-awareness refers to the ability of a
system to use situational and environmental information about the
user, location, and devices to adapt its operation accordingly [18,
27, 29]. In a SHS, all the sensors and devices follow different trigger-
action scenarios to perform tasks. Here, sensors are used to provide
input in the devices (trigger) and devices take autonomous decisions

detected in the associated motion sensors. On the other hand, users
control devices in multiple ways. For example, a user can unlock a
door by using the smartphone app or entering the code manually.
Here, the state of the lock can be determined by user activity on
the smartphone or by using a presence sensor to detect the user
near the smart lock. In short, by observing the user activities in a
SHS, it is possible to determine the normal operation of smart home
devices. One can define normal or malicious user behavior with
the user activity-device correlation. Current SHS cannot correlate
user activity and device actions correctly, which is considered as a
feature in Aegis to differentiate benign and malicious activities.
3 PROBLEM SCOPE AND THREAT MODEL
We introduce the problem scope and articulate the threat model.
3.1 Problem Scope
We assume a fully automated SHS with several smart home devices
and sensors. Here, the following sensor-device triggering rules are
configured - the smart lights are configured with motion sensors,
the smart smoke detector is configured with smoke sensor. The SHS
allows manual device control by the users (e.g., unlocking smart
lock with PIN). We also assume that the user utilizes customized
third-party apps to control the devices. Furthermore, the SHS has
more than one user authorized to control the devices in the system.
We assume the following incidents happening throughout the day
in the SHS - (1) one user is walking inside the home but the lights
are not triggered by the motion sensors, (2) one user is trying to
unlock the smart lock using PIN code, (3) a fire alarm is being
triggered in the system, (4) a smart light inside the house executes
a blinking pattern.
We propose Aegis as a novel security framework that builds a
context-aware model based on user activities to determine benign
and malicious incidents in the SHS. Aegis answers several questions
that may arise from the above-mentioned incidents - (1) What is
the reason for no activity in the smart light?, (2) Is an attacker is
trying to unlock the door using PIN code?, (3) Is the fire alarm being
triggered by a malicious app?, (4) What caused the smart light to
blink and what is the intent of this activity? Aegis differentiates
between normal and malicious activities happening in a SHS. Fur-
thermore, Aegis detects malicious activities occurring in a device
by observing the ongoing activities of all the connected devices in
the SHS.
3.2 Threat Model
Aegis considers anomalous user behaviors (e.g., unauthorized users
changing the device states) that may disrupt the normal functional-
ity of the SHS. Also, device vulnerabilities that may cause device
malfunction or open doors to threats like impersonation attacks and
false data injection attacks are considered by Aegis. Additionally,
this work assumes carelessly-designed and malicious smart home
applications that may cause unauthorized or malicious activities in
the SHS. These malicious activities may facilitate side channel and
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In Appendix D, we present specific
examples of attack scenarios that are used later to evaluate the
effectiveness of Aegis (Section 5).

ered in existing SHS.
(actions) based on these inputs. When a user performs a task in a
SHS, several smart home sensors and devices may become active
in a sequential pattern. The pattern of active devices and sensors
is different but specific for distinct user activities. Existing SHS
cannot observe these patterns in sensors’ and devices’ states over
time and can not understand the context of the user activity. For
example, while a user moves from one bedroom to a hallway, several
devices and sensors become active in a sequential manner (Figure 2):
moving towards bedroom door (sub-context 1: BL1, BLi1, BM1 are
active), bedroom door opens (sub-context 2: BL1, BLi1, BM1, BD1
are active), entering the hallway (sub-context 3: BL1, BLi1, BD1,
HLi2, HL2, HM2 are active), bedroom door and light close and
reaches the hallway (sub-context 4: HLi2, HL2, HM2 are active). To
complete the activity (moving from the bedroom to the hallway),
the user must follow the sub-contexts in the same sequential pattern.
The user cannot skip one specific sub-context and move to the next
one to complete the activity. For instance, the transition from sub-
context 1 to sub-context 4 is not possible as a user cannot go to the
hallway from the bedroom without opening the door. Motivated
by this, Aegis is designed to understand this property of SHS to
build a context-aware model for different user activities and usage
patterns and differentiates between benign and malicious activities
of smart home devices and sensors.
Sensor-device co-dependence In a SHS, sensors, and devices can
be configured as independent entities. However, they work in a
co-dependent manner to provide autonomous functionalities. For
instance, smart lights can be configured with motion sensors to
light up when motion is sensed. Here, the smart light depends on
the input from the motion sensor while the motion sensor alone
cannot provide any significant function in a SHS. The functions of
devices and sensors create a co-dependent relationship with each
other. In this way, sensors and devices in the SHS can build many-to-
many co-dependent relationships. However, existing SHSs do not
consider this co-dependent relationship and can not visualize the
context of a user activity by observing the usage pattern of smart
home entities. In short, sensors and devices in a SHS are configured
as independent components, but in reality, they are function-wise
co-dependent. Aegis considers these relations to build the context
of the user activities in a SHS.
User activity-device correlation. In a SHS, different users utilize
and control smart home devices in multiple ways. For instance, a
