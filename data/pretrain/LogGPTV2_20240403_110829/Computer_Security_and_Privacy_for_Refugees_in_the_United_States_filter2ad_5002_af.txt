less willing to speak with researchers about technology usage
and concerns, and this might skew our results.
Further, as discussed in Section IV, our sample skews
towards refugees who rely on assistance from case managers
and teachers, and may thus have lower English, technology,
or other skills than others. Furthermore, our case manager
and teacher interviews reveal their third-person perspective on
the refugees they work with, rather than those refugees’ own
views directly. We valued the case managers’ and teachers’
perspectives spanning experience with many refugees and
grounded in a deeper understanding of US culture. We also
found that our refugee focus groups corroborated information
we learned from the case managers and teachers. Because of
our focus on resettled refugees who rely on case managers
and teachers for assistance, many questions still remain about
how resettled refugees’ use of technology evolves, and what
similarities they have to other groups, such as groups with
low-income.
Finally, while we attempted to establish good rapport with
all subjects — teachers, case managers, and refugees — it is
possible that participants did not fully trust us. Although
our interviews and focus groups surface numerous ﬁndings
(Section V),
these results should be interpreted with the
knowledge that our participants might have omitted more
sensitive information.

VII. RELATED WORK
Finally, we present related work on refugees and technol-
ogy in particular, and on computer security and privacy for
different populations more generally.
Refugees and Technology. Prior work studied refugees’ use
of technology in various stages of the refugee process; Talhouk
et al. [24] broadly consider the role of the Human-Computer
Interaction community in responding to the refugee crisis.
Prior work does not consider computer security and privacy
in particular, but provides broader context and in some cases
surfaces security or privacy related ﬁndings. For example,
Gillespie et al. [6] thoroughly overview refugee technology
usage in and en route to Europe,
including surveillance
and physical risks as well as the use of social media to
spread trusted information; Flemming [3] and Peterson and
Fisher [25] study technology use among resettled refugees,
particularly for communication with family and friends. Other
work has studied technology usage within refugee camps, such
as works that surveyed smartphone usage of Syrian refugees in
a refugee camp [4], [7], works that studied a computer club in a
Palestinian refugee camp [5], [26], [27], and work that broadly
examined barriers to technology usage [8]. Other groups [28],
[29] have examined the role of technology speciﬁcally for
education in refugee camps.
Yaﬁ and Said [30] consider WhatsApp usage by resettled
refugees, and Almohamad and Vyas [11] more broadly ex-
amine the challenges faced by refugees and asylum seekers
integrating themselves into host communities and present
possible technical design interventions.
There also exist efforts to develop technology speciﬁ-
cally to help refugees navigate their new communities, in-
cluding Lantern [12], a smartphone app that connects new
refugees with experienced refugees via NFC tags placed
physically around the community; Rivrtran [31], a human-in-
the-loop translation platform for recently resettled refugees;
and RefUnite [32], a social network.
Computer Security and Privacy for Different Populations.
Our research echoes other recent work in computer security
and privacy that has observed the importance of understanding
the nuanced needs and constraints of different user popula-
tions, in order to best serve the security and privacy needs of
those populations. For example, recent work has considered
potentially particularly vulnerable user groups, including low-
income people in the US [15], domestic abuse victims [16],
[17], older adults [22], journalists [18], and activists [33]–
[35]. Sawaya et al. [36] conducted a large-scale cross-cultural
survey of security habits of people from seven countries, and
ﬁnd that security habits and knowledge vary across cultures.
Similarly, Redmiles et al. [37] and Wash et al. [38] found
difference in security beliefs and behaviors among different
demographic groups within the US. Like many of these prior
works, our work suggests that the population we study —
recently resettled refugees in the US — have distinct computer
security and privacy needs and constraints that must be un-
derstood before technologies can best be designed for this
population.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Refugees are a potentially vulnerable population, relying
increasingly on technology while attempting to establish lives
in their new homes. We studied East African and Middle
Eastern refugees recently resettled to the US to understand
their interactions with and reliance on technology, the bar-
riers they face in implementing strong computer security
and privacy practices, as well as their existing security and
privacy practices and the guidance they receive from their
case managers, teachers, and others. We conducted in-depth
semi-structured interviews with case managers and teachers
who work with these refugees, as well as focus groups with
refugees themselves. We ﬁnd that refugees are highly depen-
dent on technology and on their case managers and teachers to
help them navigate that technology, and we identify numerous
cultural, language, and knowledge barriers that impede or are
otherwise in tension with commonly recommended computer
security best practices. We draw lessons and recommendations
for the computer security community, laying a foundation for
technologies that can help overcome these barriers and better
meet the computer security and privacy needs for refugees and
other potentially vulnerable populations with similar barriers
and needs.
