### Limitations and Considerations

Participants were less willing to discuss their technology usage and related concerns, which may have introduced a bias in our results. As noted in Section IV, our sample predominantly consists of refugees who rely on assistance from case managers and teachers, and these individuals may have lower levels of English proficiency, technological skills, or other competencies compared to the broader refugee population. Additionally, the perspectives provided by case managers and teachers are based on their third-person observations rather than direct insights from the refugees themselves. We valued the case managers' and teachers' perspectives, as they are informed by extensive experience with multiple refugees and a deeper understanding of U.S. culture. Our focus groups with refugees corroborated much of the information we gathered from the case managers and teachers.

Given our focus on resettled refugees who depend on case managers and teachers for support, several questions remain regarding how their technology use evolves over time and how it compares to other groups, such as low-income populations. 

Finally, while we aimed to build strong rapport with all participants, including teachers, case managers, and refugees, it is possible that some participants did not fully trust us. Although our interviews and focus groups yielded numerous findings (as detailed in Section V), these results should be interpreted with the understanding that participants may have withheld more sensitive information.

#### Refugees and Technology

Previous research has examined the use of technology by refugees at various stages of the resettlement process. For instance, Talhouk et al. [24] explored the role of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community in addressing the refugee crisis. While prior work does not specifically focus on computer security and privacy, it provides a broader context and, in some cases, touches on related issues. Gillespie et al. [6] provided a comprehensive overview of refugee technology usage in and en route to Europe, including surveillance, physical risks, and the use of social media for trusted information dissemination. Flemming [3] and Peterson and Fisher [25] studied technology use among resettled refugees, particularly for communication with family and friends. Other studies have focused on technology usage within refugee camps, such as surveys of smartphone usage among Syrian refugees [4], [7], and the establishment of a computer club in a Palestinian refugee camp [5], [26], [27]. Some research has also examined the barriers to technology adoption [8].

Other studies have looked at the role of technology in education within refugee camps [28], [29]. Yaﬁ and Said [30] analyzed WhatsApp usage by resettled refugees, while Almohamad and Vyas [11] examined the challenges faced by refugees and asylum seekers integrating into host communities and proposed technical design interventions.

There are also initiatives to develop technology specifically to assist refugees in navigating their new communities. Examples include Lantern [12], a smartphone app that connects new refugees with experienced ones via NFC tags; Rivrtran [31], a human-in-the-loop translation platform; and RefUnite [32], a social network.

#### Computer Security and Privacy for Different Populations

Our research aligns with recent work in computer security and privacy that highlights the importance of understanding the unique needs and constraints of different user populations. Studies have considered potentially vulnerable groups, such as low-income individuals in the U.S. [15], domestic abuse victims [16], [17], older adults [22], journalists [18], and activists [33]–[35]. Sawaya et al. [36] conducted a large-scale cross-cultural survey of security habits across seven countries, finding that security practices and knowledge vary significantly across cultures. Redmiles et al. [37] and Wash et al. [38] also found differences in security beliefs and behaviors among different demographic groups within the U.S. Like these studies, our work suggests that recently resettled refugees in the U.S. have distinct computer security and privacy needs and constraints that must be understood to design effective technologies for this population.

### Conclusion

Refugees are a potentially vulnerable group, increasingly dependent on technology as they establish new lives. We studied East African and Middle Eastern refugees recently resettled in the U.S. to understand their interactions with and reliance on technology, the barriers they face in implementing strong computer security and privacy practices, and their existing security and privacy practices. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with case managers and teachers who work with these refugees, as well as focus groups with the refugees themselves. Our findings indicate that refugees are highly dependent on technology and on their case managers and teachers to navigate it. We identified numerous cultural, language, and knowledge barriers that impede or conflict with commonly recommended computer security best practices. We draw lessons and recommendations for the computer security community, laying the groundwork for technologies that can help overcome these barriers and better meet the computer security and privacy needs of refugees and other potentially vulnerable populations.
