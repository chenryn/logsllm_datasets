Abstract. Standard approaches for detecting malicious behaviors, e.g.
monitoring network traﬃc, cannot address process-related threats in
SCADA(Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems. These
threats take place when an attacker gains user access rights and performs
actions which look legitimate, but which can disrupt the industrial pro-
cess. We believe that it is possible to detect such behavior by analysing
SCADA system logs. We present MEDUSA, an anomaly-based tool for
detecting user actions that may negatively impact the system.
1 Problem
There is a wide range of possible attacks that can be carried out against SCADA
environments [1,2]. We classify possible threats in two groups: system- and
process-related. System-related threats are typical of “regular” computer net-
works, e.g., malware or Denial of Service attacks. Attackers leverage vulnerabil-
ities in networked systems and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to alter
or disrupt the industrial process. Process-related threats imply that an attacker
gains user access rights (e.g., through social engineering) and performs legiti-
mate SCADA commands which will negatively aﬀect the industrial processes.
Typical security countermeasures, e.g., antivirus or network IDSes, can hardly
detect process-related threats, as they lack process semantic.
In this work, we focus on the detection of process-related threats. Based on in-
terviews with stakeholders, we distinguish two types of threat scenarios, namely
1) an attacker impersonates a system user or 2) a legitimate system user makes
an operational mistake. A SCADA engineer manages object libraries and user
interfaces, sets working ranges for devices, etc. If an attacker succeeds in acquir-
ing the access rights of an engineer, she is then able to perform actions such
as altering a device parameter (e.g., change capacity of a tank) or altering the
system topology (e.g. some devices become “invisible”, and thus inaccessible).
A SCADA operator monitors the system status and reacts to events, such as
alarms, so that the process runs correctly. An attacker, impersonating an op-
erator or an engineer, can generate a sequence of actions where each action is
legitimate, but the combination (or even a single action) can damage the process.

501
We argue that to detect process-related attacks one needs to analyse data
passed through the system (Bigham et al. [1]) and include a semantical un-
derstanding of the process and user actions. This can be achieved either by
employing a tool such Bro, which requires the network protocol speciﬁcations
(but those could be hard to obtain due to the closeness of SCADA systems), or
by analysing system logs.
2 Solution
Typically, SCADA system logs provide detailed information about industrial
processes. However, based on interviews with stakeholders, logs are not nor-
mally processed. The reason for this is that system engineers lack time, skills
and speciﬁc tools for performing a thorough analysis. The size and high dimen-
sionality of the logs make manual inspection infeasible. For instance, a SCADA
system for a water treatment process in a medium-size city, depending on daily
activities, records between 5.000 and 15.000 events per day.
We believe that system logs can be used to detect process-related threats and
user mistakes automatically. We propose a visualization tool, MEDUSA(Mining
Events to Detect Undesirable uSer Actions in SCADA), whose engine is based on
anomaly detection. MEDUSA automatically analyses system logs, detects and
alerts users about situations in which the system behaves unconsistently with
past behavior. As a result, the number of security-related alarms that operators
have to look at is decreased. The anomaly detection models in MEDUSA are
built using two data mining techniques. First, we use algorithms for mining
outliers to detect individual actions and events that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from previous entries. Secondly, we analyse sequences of events and actions in
the logs to provide a better view on the situation context. Once we train our
model on history logs of a particular system, we plan to use the model in real-
time analysis a SCADA system.
Preliminary results show that our approach is feasible. The initial dataset con-
sists of 100.000 entries which correspond to approximatively 15 days of process
work. The attributes are mostly categorical. The goal of our initial analysis was
to transform the dataset in such a way that anomalous entries are highlighted.
We managed to extract several events that may semantically represent suspi-
cious behavior (eg., a previously unseen engineer activity in late night hours,
user expression errors when connecting to critical communication backbones).
