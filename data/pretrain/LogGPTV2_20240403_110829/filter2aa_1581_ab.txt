as found and displays the error. 
 SC: If user is blocked, tries for next user. 
 SC: Test for SSPI (actual Windows user authentication) 
 SC: Specify System version type (SQLServer 2k, 2k5, 2k8 or lastest) 
 SC: Specify Local Machine Name 
 SC: Specify database to connect 
 Try SA user with null password 
Hacks: 
SQLClient and raw brute force. SSL Support. 
Post-Hacks: 
 Open UI for command execution. Opens a basic GUI to execute commands. 
Saves the command log in the Report Database (see report section). If don’t 
have enough permissions to execute commands, it tries to hack it using: 
sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1; RECONFIGURE; sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1; 
RECONFIGURE  
 One click ownage hack. Execute any payload you define (default is TX shell), 
just as specified in http://ferruh.mavituna.com/papers/oneclickownage.pdf.  
 Show Databases the user can access  
 Fetch Users Info, including: Usernames, SID, Password Hash, Creation date, 
is disabled and default database name.  
 Open Scylla DB Browser 
MySQL (MySQUAL in honor to SENA, Colombia xD) 
This module uses MySQL.Data.dll or ODBC (no support available) to connect to the 
remote host. A “raw” and faster version will be also implemented with limited pre-hacks.  
Pre-Hacks: 
 If max users connection limit reached, wait 100 ms until next try (with the 
same thread).  
 If received message "password to long must be hex", just try the passwords 
that meet: passLen LESSOREQUALTHAN #password(length received in the 
error) AND !password.haveDigits  
 Just try passwords of less than 16 characters (mysql don’t support more)  
 If want to use SSL certificates or a special SSL cipher connection, it would 
use ODBC with the specified options. Also, an auto-signed certificate is 
provided.  
Hacks: 
SSL support, specially crafted SSL configuration, certificate based SSL 
Post-Hacks: 
 Fetch databases that can be accessed by the user.  
 Fetch users profile, including: Host, User name, Password hash, Select_priv, 
Insert_priv, Update_priv, Delete_priv, Create_priv, Drop_priv, Reload_priv, 
Shutdown_priv, Process_priv, File_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv, 
Index_priv, Alter_priv.  
 If there is a http server, try to upload a web based PHP shell to it (A specially 
basic auto-destroyable shell, or the famous C99).  
 Execute server commands (via UDF) 
 Open Scylla DB Browser 
DB2 
Pre-Hacks: 
 Obtain DAS information (server database access profile) 
 - User-ID auth only - brute force 
 Fetch EXCSAT and other packet responses (used to Auto Configure the Hack 
phase and give additional info to the user). 
 Host less than 18 characters accepted 
Hack: 
SSL support (if applicable), encrypted auth. 
Post-Hacks: 
 List all tables (list tables for all) 
 List tables for specific users (select name, creator from systables order by name) 
 Security policies check (select * from syssecuritypolicies) 
 Audit policies check (select * from sysauditpolicies) 
 Fetch Roles and Role authorizations 
 Fetch for users authorizations (select grantee, tableschema, tablename from 
sysuserauth) 
 Fetch users and users privileges 
ORACLE 
This module uses Ora.Net provider for database connection. TNSListener module 
is built as a partner of Oracle module. 
Pre-Hacks 
 Fetch SID 
 SID Brute force 
 TNS version detection 
 Allow the user to specify a SID (obligatory if no SID could be fetched or 
guessed, if no, Scylla would use ORCL) 
 Try to use over 500 default users-passwords before the real brute force 
 Fetch Blocked accounts 
Hack: 
If user must connect as SYSOPER or SYSDBA, tell the user and append SYSDBA 
to the connection string for post-hacks. 
Post-Hacks: 
 Fetch usernames and user information 
 Fetch users access dates 
 Fetch new and old password hashes 
 Fetch database names the user can see 
 Fetch Policies 
 Fetch Roles and Role information 
 Fetch Links (useful to find clear-text passwords and other interesting info) 
 Open Scylla DB Browser 
SMB 
The trick here is using the windows API that is actually faster than SAMBA. This module 
is not just about SMB, but windows RPC. 
Pre-Hacks: 
 Try for null or anonymous sessions. 
 Try to fetch password policy and adjust the hack phase settings to avoid 
blocking users and stuff like that. 
 If operating system just accepts LM authentication, remove all password 
of length greater than 14 from the password list. 
Hack: 
NT, LM, NTLMv2, all what WNetAddConnection3 supports 
Post-Hacks: 
 fgDump wrapper (get password hashes) 
 Fetch Users 
 Fetch groups (relation user-groups relation) 
 Fetch OS Version 
 Fetch RPC Binds 
 Fetch network Adapters 
 Fetch Disks and shares 
 Fetch active sessions 
 Fetch Event log 
 System Date and Time 
 Fetch patch level 
 Via Active directory: 
GetShares (directories) 
GetGroups 
Get Operating system version 
Get Users 
HTTP 
This module is a bit different; it is divided into three sub-modules: 
HTTP-Basic Auth: Where the only real pre-hack is to fetch the authentication 
type supported in basic-auth module (and auto-configure brute force hack 
depending in it). It supports Digest (using MD5) and basic auth. 
HTTP-Form: This is like other brute-forcers but it is a bit more intuitive. For the 
next release (hope for this one) a new Charybdis module will be built to auto-
configure brute force parameters depending on user navigation. 
HTTP-Dir/File Brute Force: Tries to find hidden directories/files based on 
brute force.  Also, this module maps the entire webpage to find its entire 
structure, based on HEAD commands for brute force and GET for web mapping. 
The 3xx response, searches in the location parameter. A bit of an intelligent 
modification, it doesn’t show the user an apparently found file (from web 
mapping) if it doesn’t receive a 200 or 403 response. It cuts down on the 
number of false positives and, like every Scylla module, “error proof”. 
Postgres 
This module uses NPgsql.dll. 
Pre-Hacks:  
 Try admin-admin user-password combination 
Hacks: 
SSL support, crypt, password, md5 and others supported by NPgsql.dll 
Post-Hacks: 
 Fetch databases that can be accessed by the user. 
 Fetch user’s profile (pg_shadow, pg_user, pg_group, etc.) 
 Open Scylla DB Browser 
LDAP 
Ldap Query tool 
Pre-Hacks:  
Try null password 
Try Anonymous Auth 
Hacks: 
SSL support 
Post-Hacks: 
 Fetch Users info 
 Fetch Groups 
 Fetch Computer info 
DNS Snooping 
Pre-Hacks:  
 Try to see if the server is vulnerable by querying the server for common 
names 
Hacks: 
SSL support 
Post-Hacks: 
 Fetch Answers 
 Fetch Name Servers 
 Fetch Additional info 
 Determine if it’s an authoritative server 
Report Module 
Every result the modules throw are stored in a SQLCE database, so your session information 
won’t get lost. A report viewer was built so you can see the information easily. 
THE FUTURE 
This took eight months of work, just for DEF CON 20. Now try to imagine the future of this tool. 
We will work, primarily to try to make it faster and more accurate. There are other modules 
planed like SVN, CVS, RSH, RDP, and more. And at last we will be adding hacks, tons of hacks, 
we’ll try to make it a more complete tool of this kind.  
There are also plans to synchronize Scylla with other tools like MSF and Nessus. 
Our principal objective is to give as most capabilities to the users, and still be a “hacker-
oriented” tool. We are conscious that there is no “wonder tool for everything” and that real 
hacking is more of a manual process, and that all we need is information, and possibly 
direction. 
CONCLUSION 
Perhaps I’m not the best qualified person to be writing something here, you have the 
documentation and you can try this tool, so you can make your own conclusions. There is one 
last thing to be said: I’m not intending to say that other tools are “worse” (they might be better 
than Scylla) just that maybe I got more free time. Every referenced tool here is a master piece 
(If you have got some time you should please check them out.), I thank the authors for 
building them and give people like me tools to work, and even better, Inspiration! 
You could be sure of something… There is more coming soon!
