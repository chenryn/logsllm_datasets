Abstract. Most residential broadband services are described in terms
of their maximum potential throughput rate, often advertised as having
speeds “up to X Mbps”. Though such promises are often met, they are
fairly limited in scope and, unfortunately, there is no basis for an appeal
if a customer were to receive compromised quality of service. While this
‘best eﬀort’ model was suﬃcient in the early days, we argue that as broad-
band customers and their devices become more dependent on Internet
connectivity, we will see an increased demand for more encompassing
Service Level Agreements (SLA).
In this paper, we study the design space of broadband SLAs and
explore some of the trade-oﬀs between the level of strictness of SLAs
and the cost of delivering them. We argue that certain SLAs could be
oﬀered almost immediately with minimal impact on retail prices, and
that ISPs (or third parties) could accurately infer the risk of oﬀering
SLA to individual customers – with accuracy comparable to that in the
car or credit insurance industry – and price the SLA service accordingly.
1 Introduction
In today’s broadband markets, service plans are typically described in terms of
their maximum download throughput rate, often advertised as “up to X Mbps”.
This advertised capacity, along with the associated monthly cost, are the two
primary, and many times only, pieces of information available to consumers
when comparing service providers. Such “constrained” service agreements place
services using technologies as diverse as ﬁber, DSL, WiMAX or satellite on
nearly equal grounds, and leave consumers without clear expectations given that,
strictly speaking, any speed less than X would meet such a guarantee.
We argue that as Internet users and their devices become more dependent
on connectivity and consistency, broadband will move from a loosely regulated
luxury to a key utility. This in turn will usher in a growing demand for more
encompassing, well-deﬁned SLAs similar to those of other utilities, such as elec-
tricity and water.
We believe that the adoption of SLAs could beneﬁt all players in the broad-
band market – service providers, customers, and regulators. From the ISP’s
perspective, contracts with SLAs could allow them to better diﬀerentiate their

retail services and ﬁne-tune their contracts to the needs of particular classes of
customers (e.g., a service for gamers or business users).1 For customers, SLAs
could signiﬁcantly simplify the process of comparing services oﬀered by diﬀer-
ent providers, allowing customers to make more informed decisions. This could
improve competition and potentially lower prices. Similarly, for regulators and
policymakers, SLAs would provide a better way to gauge broadband infrastruc-
ture across communities and justify investments.
Despite these potential beneﬁts, there are several challenges in deﬁning SLAs
for broadband services that range from identifying metrics and deﬁning the
appropriate SLA structures to engineering compliance monitoring.
SLAs must be designed so that they can be accurately and eﬃciently mon-
itored and that they add value to providers and consumers, while limiting the
risk of non-compliance. We expect broadband SLAs to be speciﬁed, as other
network SLAs, in terms of transport-level performance assurances using Quality
of Service metrics such as bandwidth, packet loss, delay and availability. While
the relationship between such QoS metrics and users’ experience with diﬀerent
applications is a topic of ongoing research, existing approaches rely on such QoS
metrics as input to application speciﬁc models of QoE estimation (e.g., [5,15]).
An SLA could be seen as an insurance policy against the risk of not receiv-
ing the contracted level of service. Consequently, SLA-enhanced services would
come with a price-tag for providers that depends on the structure of the SLA
and degree of risk involved in the delivering the desired levels of service. Using
four-years of data from the largest, publicly available dataset of broadband per-
formance [10], we study the design space of broadband SLAs and demonstrate
that certain SLAs could be oﬀered almost immediately with minimal impact on
retail prices and network investment.
In this paper, we make a case for broadband SLAs and follow a data-driven
approach to explore some of these key challenges. We makes the following con-
tributions:
– We analyze diﬀerent QoS metrics for use in SLA and deﬁne a set of broad-
band SLAs (Sect. 2). We ﬁnd that, across all ISPs and access technologies,
bandwidth is the most consistent of the studied performance metrics.
– We evaluate the relationship between SLA structure and the cost of supporting
them with diﬀerent access technologies (Sect. 3). We show that many of the
studied ISPs could oﬀer moderate SLAs with minimal impact on their existing
business, but that SLAs with stringent constraints are much harder to deliver
across the whole user-base.
– We show that ISPs (or third parties) could accurately infer the risk of oﬀering
SLA to individual customers – with accuracy comparable to that in the car
or credit insurance industry – and price the SLA service accordingly (Sect. 4).
We conclude the paper (Sects. 5 and 6) with a discussion of some of the key
open issues and potential future directions for this work.

2 Metrics for a Broadband SLA
An SLA is a contract between a service provider and its customers that speci-
ﬁes what services the provider will support and what penalties it will pay upon
violations. A meaningful SLA should (i) capture the needs of consumers, (ii) be
feasible to support by most service providers today and (iii) be expressed in mea-
surable terms that can be validated by both consumers and services providers.
To understand the need of broadband consumers, we must consider the
requirements of commonly used network applications. Clearly, one would not
expect that “broadband consumers” would be a homogeneous class in either
the type of applications they value most or their expectations. For some con-
sumers, being able to browse the web or read their email may be suﬃcient,
and paying for a higher guaranteed throughput would not be a priority. Others
may have higher performance requirements, wanting a connection that reliably
allows them to stream HD video content or play online games with strict timing
requirements.
Driven by these observations, current literature on the needs of diﬀerent
application classes (e.g., [6,7,27]) and our dataset [10], we drafted three poten-
tial broadband SLAs that cover a wide range of user requirements. Note that
these are mere examples of possible SLAs, focused on the points relevant to our
argument, and ignoring the speciﬁcs of a practical SLA, such as the form of
reporting quality of service violations, the procedure to be invoked in case of
violations or the exact cost model of violations.
Our basic SLAs (see Table 1) are stated in terms of throughput, latency
and packet loss. Considering that subscription capacity is already advertised
by ISPa and varies across users, we structure SLAs in terms of the percentage
of subscription speed available. For latency and packet loss, we adopt a simple
“below-threshold” model. SLA A represents a service that should be able to ﬁt
the demands of users with very strict performance requirements for applications
such as real time gaming. SLA C characterizes a service that could support
simple applications, such as browsing the web or email. Finally, SLA B matches
the middle-of-the-road services, capable of supporting most applications, such
as video chat or video streaming, but with less than perfect performance for
network-intensive applications.
Although they are somewhat arbitrary, the thresholds we use for our sample
SLAs – from fractions of throughput to latency and loss rate – are based on
existing literature and earlier studies of broadband services.
For service capacity, we selected 10% of capacity as a bottom threshold
(SLA C ) since the vast majority of users in our dataset had a connection much

faster than 1 Mbps and that 100 kbps can support basic browsing and email
requirements. We opted for 50% as a threshold for SLA B following a 2010 report
from the UK Oﬃce of Communication (Ofcom) reporting that surveyed users
received, on average, nearly half (46%) of the their advertised speed [16]. Finally,
for our highest SLA we opted for 90% as a threshold to highlight providers that
consistently deliver capacities close to their subscription speeds.
In terms of packet loss, previous work has shown that rates above 1% can have
a negative impact on users’ QoE while using gaming applications [7]. High loss
rates can also aﬀect other common services such as audio and video calls [6]. Xu
et al. [27], for instance, shows that loss rates above 4% can signiﬁcantly degrade
iChat video calls and rates larger than 10% result in a sharp increase in packet
retransmissions.
We selected thresholds for latency in a similar manner. Our least demanding
SLA, SLA C, has a latency threshold of 250 ms, since larger latencies can signiﬁ-
cantly increase page loading time [3] and would likely have a negative impact on
QoE. End-to-end latencies below approximately 150 ms, the threshold for SLA
B, should be suﬃcient for Skype calls [21]. Last, our low threshold for SLA A
is based on previous work showing that an increase of just 10 ms can yield an
increase in page loading delays by hundreds of milliseconds [25].
3 Supporting SLA Today
Building on these SLAs that would be meaningful to end-users, we now explore
what sort of service guarantees it would be feasible for ISPs to provide to sub-
scribers. We do this by looking at the performance and consistency of broadband
services oﬀered by US-based ISPs. We ﬁrst describe the dataset on broadband
services used throughout our analysis.
3.1 Dataset
We leverage the largest, publicly available dataset of broadband performance
collected through the FCC’s Measuring Broadband America eﬀort [10]. Since
2011, the US FCC has been working with SamKnows to distribute home gate-
ways (“whiteboxes”) to broadband customers that conduct and report network
measurements. These devices have collected increasingly rich data, including
metrics such as latency, throughput and page loading time for a number of pop-
ular websites. A full description of all the tests performed and data collected is
available in the FCC’s technical appendix [9]. This data has been mostly used
by the FCC to create periodic reports on the state of broadband access in the
United States.
We employ the full four years of measurements made available in order
