## Abstract
Residential broadband services are typically marketed based on their maximum potential throughput, often advertised as "up to X Mbps." While these claims may be met, they offer limited scope and no recourse for customers experiencing subpar service. This "best effort" model, while sufficient in the past, is becoming inadequate as consumers and their devices increasingly rely on consistent Internet connectivity. We argue that there will be a growing demand for more comprehensive Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in the broadband industry.

In this paper, we explore the design space of broadband SLAs and examine the trade-offs between the strictness of SLAs and the cost of delivering them. We contend that certain SLAs can be implemented with minimal impact on retail prices. Furthermore, ISPs or third parties could accurately assess the risk of offering SLAs to individual customers, similar to the methods used in the car or credit insurance industries, and price the SLA service accordingly.

## 1. Introduction
In today's broadband market, service plans are primarily described by their maximum download throughput rate, often advertised as "up to X Mbps." This advertised capacity, along with the monthly cost, are the primary pieces of information available to consumers when comparing service providers. Such "constrained" service agreements place various technologies, such as fiber, DSL, WiMAX, or satellite, on nearly equal footing, leaving consumers without clear expectations since any speed less than X would meet the guarantee.

We argue that as Internet users and their devices become more dependent on consistent connectivity, broadband will transition from a loosely regulated luxury to a key utility. This shift will drive a growing demand for more comprehensive and well-defined SLAs, similar to those in other utilities like electricity and water.

The adoption of SLAs could benefit all stakeholders in the broadband market—service providers, customers, and regulators. For ISPs, SLAs could enable better differentiation of their services and tailoring of contracts to specific customer needs, such as gamers or business users. For customers, SLAs could simplify the process of comparing services from different providers, leading to more informed decisions and potentially improved competition and lower prices. For regulators and policymakers, SLAs would provide a better way to evaluate broadband infrastructure across communities and justify investments.

Despite these benefits, defining SLAs for broadband services presents several challenges, including identifying metrics, defining appropriate SLA structures, and engineering compliance monitoring. SLAs must be designed to be accurately and efficiently monitored, adding value to both providers and consumers while minimizing the risk of non-compliance. We expect broadband SLAs to be specified in terms of transport-level performance assurances using Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as bandwidth, packet loss, delay, and availability.

An SLA can be seen as an insurance policy against the risk of not receiving the contracted level of service. Consequently, SLA-enhanced services would come with a price tag for providers, depending on the SLA structure and the degree of risk involved. Using four years of data from the largest, publicly available dataset of broadband performance, we study the design space of broadband SLAs and demonstrate that certain SLAs could be offered with minimal impact on retail prices and network investment.

In this paper, we make a case for broadband SLAs and follow a data-driven approach to explore these key challenges. Our contributions include:
- Analyzing different QoS metrics for use in SLAs and defining a set of broadband SLAs.
- Evaluating the relationship between SLA structure and the cost of supporting them with different access technologies.
- Showing that ISPs or third parties could accurately infer the risk of offering SLAs to individual customers and price the SLA service accordingly.

## 2. Metrics for a Broadband SLA
An SLA is a contract between a service provider and its customers that specifies the services the provider will support and the penalties for violations. A meaningful SLA should capture the needs of consumers, be feasible to support by most service providers, and be expressed in measurable terms that can be validated by both consumers and providers.

To understand the needs of broadband consumers, we must consider the requirements of commonly used network applications. Consumers have varying needs, from basic web browsing and email to high-performance applications like real-time gaming and HD video streaming.

Based on these observations, current literature, and our dataset, we propose three potential broadband SLAs that cover a wide range of user requirements (Table 1). These SLAs are stated in terms of throughput, latency, and packet loss. We structure SLAs in terms of the percentage of subscription speed available and adopt a "below-threshold" model for latency and packet loss.

| SLA | Throughput (% of service) | Latency (ms) | Packet Loss (%) | Description |
|-----|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| A   | >90%                      | <50          | <1%             | Demanding applications (e.g., real-time gaming) |
| B   | >50%                      | <150         | <5%             | Video streaming, telephony |
| C   | >10%                      | <250         | <10%            | Web browsing, email |

These thresholds are based on existing literature and earlier studies of broadband services. For example, SLA A is suitable for users with very strict performance requirements, such as real-time gaming, while SLA C supports basic applications like web browsing and email.

## 3. Supporting SLA Today
Building on these SLAs, we explore what service guarantees it would be feasible for ISPs to provide to subscribers. We do this by analyzing the performance and consistency of broadband services offered by US-based ISPs.

### 3.1 Dataset
We use the largest, publicly available dataset of broadband performance collected through the FCC’s Measuring Broadband America effort [10]. Since 2011, the US FCC has been working with SamKnows to distribute home gateways ("whiteboxes") to broadband customers that conduct and report network measurements. These devices collect data on metrics such as latency, throughput, and page loading time for popular websites. The full description of the tests and data collected is available in the FCC’s technical appendix [9].

We employ four years of measurements from this dataset to analyze the feasibility of implementing SLAs.
