The Go language has this cool feature for struct composition where if you put
one struct after another's values, its values are inherited into the other.
    type foo1 struct {
        bar   string
    }
    type foo2 struct {
        baz   string
        foo1  // foo2 now also has the field "bar" inherited from foo1
    }
This seems like it would fit well into Julia.
My suggested implementation would be:
    struct foo1
        bar::String
    end
    struct foo2
        baz::String
        foo1...
    end
Thanks for taking the time to read this! It would be yet another pretty nifty
trick that Julia could use.
