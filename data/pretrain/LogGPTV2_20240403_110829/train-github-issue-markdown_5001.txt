Is it possible to scale fonts using rem instead of px or %?  
Using font-size: 62.5% in html tag as default, make simple calculations for
font sizes like 24px = 2.4rem, 12px = 1.2rem, etc.
Then, changing the html font-size via media queries, we can auto-scale all the
text in page.
Is this possible in new versions to come?
Thanks
