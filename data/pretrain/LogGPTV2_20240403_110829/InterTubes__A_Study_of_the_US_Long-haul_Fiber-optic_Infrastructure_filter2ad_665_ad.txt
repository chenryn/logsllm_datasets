where E A is the set of all possible paths obtained from
the risk matrix. The difference between the original set of
existing network hops and the hops seen in the optimized
paths produced from equation 1 forms the additional peer-
ing points. Depending on operational needs and robustness
requirements, the framework can used to optimize speciﬁc
paths or the entire network, thereby improving the robust-
ness of the network at different granularities.
In our analysis of the constructed physical map of the
ﬁber-optic infrastructure in the US, we found that there are
12 out of 542 conduits that are shared by more than 17 out
of the 20 ISPs we considered in our study. We begin by ana-
lyzing these twelve links and how network robustness could
be improved through our robustness suggestion framework.
We use two speciﬁc metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of
the robustness suggestion: (1) path inﬂation (PI) i.e., the dif-
ference between the number of hops in the original path and

Besides focusing on optimizing network robustness by ad-
dressing the 12 heavily-shared links, we also considered how
to optimize ISP networks considering all 542 conduits with
lit ﬁber identiﬁed in our map of the physical infrastructure
in the US. We do not show detailed results due to space con-
straints, but what we found in our analysis was that many of
the existing paths used by ISPs were already the best paths,

and that the potential gains were minimal compared to the
gains obtained when just considering the 12 conduits.
Overall, these results are encouraging, because they imply
that it is sufﬁcient to optimize the network around a targeted
set of highly-shared links. They also suggest that modest
additions of city-to-city backup links would be enough to
get most of the potential robustness gains.
5.2
Increasing Network Robustness (II)
In this section we consider how to improve network ro-
bustness by adding up to k new city-to-city ﬁber conduits.
We consider the existing physical map as a graph G = V,E
along with the risk matrix A. Our goal is to identify a new set
of edges along with E such that the addition (1) causes the
largest increase in overall robustness, i.e., greatest reduction
in shared risk, and (2) while imposing the smallest deploy-
ment cost (DC), i.e., the cost per ﬁber conduit mile, com-
pared with alternate shortest paths between two city pairs.
Formally, let ˆE = {{u,v} : u,v ∈ V and {u,v} /∈ E} be the
set of edges not in G and let ˆA be the reduced shared risk
matrix of network ˆG = (V, E ∪ S) for some set S ∈ ˆE. We
want to ﬁnd S ∈ ˆE of size k such that
S = argmax(λA − λ ˆA)

Figure 11 shows the improvement ratio (avg.
shared
risk after adding link(s) divided by avg.
shared risk be-
fore adding link(s)) for the 20 ISPs considered in our study.
The objective function is to deploy new ﬁber at geograph-
ically diverse locations such that the deployment cost (i.e.,
the length of ﬁber) is minimized and global shared risk is re-
duced. As expected, we see good improvement for ISPs with
smaller infrastructural footprints in the US, e.g., for Telia,
Tata, etc. and very little improvement for large US-based
ISPs such as Level 3, CenturyLink, and Cogent, since their
networks already have fairly rich connectivity. An interest-
ing case is Suddenlink, which shows no improvement even
after adding multiple links. We attribute this result to the de-
pendency on the other ISPs to reach destinations because of
its geographically diverse conduit paths.
5.3 Reducing Propagation Delay
In this section we examine propagation delays between
individual city pairs in our map of the physical ﬁber in-
frastructure in the US. Since there may be multiple existing
physical conduit paths between two cities, we consider the
average delay across all physical paths versus the best (low-
est) delay along one of the existing physical paths. We also
consider how delay may be reduced by adding new physi-
cal conduit paths that follow existing roads or railways (i.e.,
existing rights-of-way) between a pair of cities. Lastly, we
consider the possibility of adding new physical conduit that
ignores rights-of-way and simply follows the line-of-sight
(LOS). Although following the LOS is in most cases practi-
cally infeasible, it represents the minimum achievable delay
between two cities and thus provides a lower bound on per-
formance.
Figure 12: Comparison of best links against avg. latencies of links,
ROW links and LOS links.
Figure 12 plots the cumulative distribution function of de-
lays across all city pairs that have existing conduits between
them. We ﬁrst observe in the ﬁgure that the average de-
lays of existing links between city pairs are often substan-
tially higher than the best existing link. This result suggests
that there are some long-haul ﬁber links that traverse much
longer distances than necessary between two cities, perhaps
due to ease of deployment or lower costs in certain conduits.
We also observe that even the best existing paths do not fol-
low the shortest rights-of-way between two cities, but that
the difference in many cases is fairly small. In particular,

Lastly, we observe that the LOS distance between two cities
versus the best ROW path (or best existing path) varies. For
50% of the paths, the difference is under 100 microseconds
(i.e., approximately 20 km), but for 25% of the paths the dif-
ference is more than 500 microseconds (i.e., more than 100
km), with some differences exceeding 2 milliseconds (i.e.,
more than 400 km; see [32]). These results indicate that it is
important to consider rights-of-way when evaluating possi-
ble improvements to propagation delays in the Internet, since
line-of-sight distances may differ signiﬁcantly and may not
be practically achievable.
6 Discussion
In this section, we discuss the broader implications of our
ﬁndings and offer ideas on how the additional infrastructure
indicated by our analysis might be practically deployed.
6.1
Implications for Service Providers
Our base map of the US long-haul ﬁber infrastructure
highlights the ﬁber conduits used to transmit data between
large population centers. While infrastructure such as con-
tent delivery networks and data centers complicate the de-
tails of data ﬂows, this map can support and inform de-
cisions by service providers on provisioning and manage-
ment of their infrastructures. Beyond performance and ro-
bustness analysis, the base map can inform decisions on lo-
cal/regional broadband deployment, peering, and route se-
lection, as well as provide competitive insights. Further,
the fact that there is widespread and sometimes signiﬁcant
conduit sharing complicates the task of identifying and con-
ﬁguring backup paths since these critical details are often
opaque to higher layers. Enrichment of this map through
the addition of long-haul links in other regions around the
world, undersea cable maps for inter-continental connectiv-
ity, and metro-level ﬁber maps will improve our global view
of the physical Internet and will provide valuable insights
for all involved players (e.g., regional, national, or global-
scale providers). Finally, the map also informs regulatory
and oversight activities that focus on ensuring a safe and ac-
cessible physical communications infrastructure.
While much prior work on aspects of (logical) Internet
connectivity at layer 3 and above points to the dynamic na-
ture of the corresponding graph structures as an invariant,
it is important to recognize that the (physical) long-haul in-
frastructure is comparably static by deﬁnition (i.e., deploy-
ing new ﬁber takes time). In that sense, the links reﬂected
in our map can also be considered an Internet invariant, and
it is instructive to compare the basic structure of our map to
the NSFNET backbone circa 1995 [54].
6.2 The FCC and Title II
Over the past several years, there have been many discus-
sions about the topic of network neutrality. The US Commu-
nications Act of 1934 [17] is mentioned frequently in those
discussions since Title II of that Act enables the FCC to spec-
ify communications providers as “common carriers". One
implication of the recent FCC decision to reclassify broad-
band Internet providers as common carriers is that parts of
a provider’s infrastructure, including utility poles and con-
duits, will need to be made available to third parties. If this
decision is upheld, it will likely lead to third party providers
taking advantage of expensive already-existing long-haul in-
frastructure to facilitate the build out of their own infrastruc-
ture at considerably lower cost. Indeed, this is exactly the
issue that has been raised by Google in their current ﬁber
deployment efforts [38]. Furthermore, an important con-
sequence of the additional sharing of long-haul infrastruc-
ture that will likely take place if the Title II classiﬁcation
is upheld is a signiﬁcant increase in shared risk. We argue
that this tradeoff between broader metro-area ﬁber deploy-
ments (e.g., Google) and the increased risks in shared long-
haul infrastructure requires more careful consideration in the
broader Title II debate.
6.3 Enriching US Long-Haul Infrastruc-
ture
On the one hand, our study shows that the addition of a
small number of conduits can lead to signiﬁcant reductions
in shared risk and propagation delays. At the same time, our
examination of public records also shows that new conduit
infrastructure is being deployed at a steady rate. Assuming
that the locations for these actual deployments are based on
a combination of business-related factors and are not nec-
essarily aligned with the links that our techniques identify,
the question that arises is how the conduits identiﬁed in our
analysis might actually be deployed.
We believe that a version of the Internet exchange point
(IXP) model could be adapted for conduits.
IXPs largely
grew out of efforts by consortia of service providers as
means for keeping local trafﬁc local [79]. We argue that
the deployment of key long-haul links such as those identi-
ﬁed in our study would be compelling for a potentially large
number of service providers, especially if the cost for partic-
ipating providers would be competitive. At the same time,
given the implications for shared risk and the critical na-
ture of communications infrastructure, government support
may be warranted.9 In fact, the involvement of some states’
DOTs in the build-out and leasing of new conduits can be
viewed as an early form of the proposed “link exchange”
model [15].

The Internet’s basic design [81] makes it robust against fail-
ures of physical components such as routers and links. While
IP routing allows the network to dynamically detect and
route around failures, events such as natural or technological
disasters (e.g., [42,57]), malicious attacks (e.g., [66]) and be-
nign incidents (e.g., [64]) can have localized effects, includ-
ing the loss of connectivity for varying numbers of Internet
users for certain amounts of time. The main reasons for such
localized and temporal Internet outages are typically a lack

575Analyzing the robustness of the physical Internet has been
the focus of many prior research efforts. These include
studies on its robust yet fragile nature [82, 104], vulnera-
bility [86, 87, 106], survivability [90, 91], resilience analy-
sis [74,84,105], reachability [76,94], security and robustness
of components [93], fault detection/localization [85, 95, 98],
and the development of resilient routing protocols [75,88,89,
102, 107]. In contrast to these and similar prior efforts, our
study is the ﬁrst to consider the extensive levels of physical
infrastructure sharing in today’s Internet, use various metrics
to quantify the resulting shared risk and offer viable sugges-
tions for improving the overall robustness of the physical
Internet to link and/or router failures.
Our study centers around the construction of a high-
ﬁdelity map of the long-haul ﬁber-optic routes in the US In-
ternet and relies critically on a ﬁrst-of-its-kind analysis of the
detailed geography of these routes. On the one hand, there
exists prior work on mapping the US long-haul ﬁber-optic
network (see for example [2,36]), but the resulting maps are
of uncertain quality, lack important details, and are not re-
producible. There have also been prior studies that examine
different aspects of the Internet infrastructure and various
spatial patterns that have emerged (see for example [97]).
On the other hand, the basic map constructed as part of our
work is based on rich information from publicly available
resources and can be reproduced by anybody who has the
time and energy to gather the available but not necessarily
easy-to-locate information.
of geographic diversity in connectivity [2,40] and a tendency
for signiﬁcant physical infrastructure sharing among the af-
fected providers—the very focus of this paper. In particular,
this paper is not about the Internet’s vulnerability to non-
physical cyber attacks (e.g., [46]) that rely on the existence
and full functionality of the Internet’s physical infrastructure
to achieve their goals and do maximal damage [82].
The detailed analysis of our long-haul ﬁber-optic network
map is made possible by using geocoded network maps and
the ArcGIS framework [30], and is unprecedented both in
terms of accuracy and ability for validation. In contrast to the
work by Lakhina et al. [96] who use geolocation databases
to obtain the approximate link lengths between geolocated
routers, our study avoids the issues related to router-level
granularity (e.g., errors in geolocating routers, use of line-
of-sight for estimating link distances) by exploiting the de-
tailed geography of the long-haul ﬁber-optic routes between
major city pairs and computing their actual lengths. In the
process, we compare our long-haul ﬁber-optic map to ex-
isting transportation infrastructure (e.g., railway, roadways)
and quantify previously made qualitative observations that
