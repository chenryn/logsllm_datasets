## Abstract
Mobile communication is an essential part of our daily lives, and it must be secure and reliable. In this paper, we investigate the security of feature phones, which are the most common type of mobile phone globally. We developed a framework to analyze the security of SMS clients on feature phones, using a small, commercially available GSM base station. Our analysis uncovered vulnerabilities in the feature phone platforms of all major manufacturers. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to launch attacks against end-users and mobile operators, potentially disrupting communication on a large scale from anywhere in the world. Further analysis revealed that certain configurations of the mobile network amplify these attacks. We conclude by providing a set of countermeasures.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, significant research has focused on analyzing and attacking smartphones [18, 20, 24, 21, 22, 23, 46, 45], while feature phones have been largely overlooked. Feature phones, which offer advanced capabilities beyond voice calling and text messaging but are not considered smartphones, make up the majority of mobile devices currently in use. Smartphones account for only about 16% of all mobile phones [43]. The lack of security research on feature phones is partly due to the fact that smartphones share many similarities with desktop computers, making them easier to analyze. Researchers can use familiar tools and techniques from desktop environments. In contrast, feature phones are highly embedded systems that are closed to developers, leaving billions of potentially vulnerable devices (approximately 4.6 billion mobile phone subscribers [43, 16]) open to exploitation by knowledgeable attackers.

This paper investigates the security of feature phones and the potential for large-scale attacks based on discovered vulnerabilities. We present a novel approach to vulnerability analysis, specifically for SMS client implementations. SMS is a universal feature on all mobile phones, and security issues related to SMS can be exploited from almost anywhere, making it an ideal attack vector. To our knowledge, no previous attempt has been made to analyze or test feature phones for security vulnerabilities.

Analyzing feature phones is challenging due to their closed nature, lack of development tools, and the black-box nature of the mobile network. To address these challenges, we built our own GSM network using commercially available equipment. This network allows us to send SMS messages and monitor the behavior of the phones, replacing the need for traditional debugging tools.

We conducted vulnerability analysis using fuzzing, as source code was not available and reverse engineering a large number of devices was not feasible. Fuzzing proved to be efficient, allowing us to analyze a large number of mobile handsets with the same set of tests.

Our findings include numerous vulnerabilities in feature phones from the six leading mobile phone manufacturers. These vulnerabilities can remotely crash and reboot the entire phone, disconnecting it from the mobile network and interrupting active calls and data connections. Such attacks, similar to the "Ping-of-Death" [6], represent a serious threat to global mobile telephony.

We also analyzed the impact of these attacks on the mobile core network, revealing two key findings: first, the mobile network can be abused to amplify Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and second, attacking mobile phones can indirectly attack the mobile network itself.

The main contributions of this paper are:
- **Vulnerability Analysis Framework for Feature Phones**: A novel method using a small GSM base transceiver station to conduct vulnerability analysis, addressing the challenge of monitoring for crashes and unexpected behavior.
- **Bugs Present in Most Phones**: Demonstrating that vulnerabilities exist in most deployed mobile phones, which can be exploited for large-scale DoS attacks.
- **Attack Impact**: Showing that a small number of bugs in popular mobile phone brands can disrupt a significant number of mobile phones worldwide, and that these bugs can be used to attack the mobile network infrastructure.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 explains target selection, Section 4 details the security analysis of feature phones, Section 5 outlines methods for large-scale attacks, Section 6 presents detection and prevention methods, and Section 7 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work
Related work is categorized into four parts: smartphone vulnerability analysis, mobile and feature phone bugs, attacks on mobile networks, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

### Smartphone Vulnerability Analysis
Researchers have developed frameworks for analyzing Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Short Message Service (SMS) implementations on smartphones [24, 23]. These studies used traditional techniques such as debuggers and crash dump analysis. Our work differs in that we do not rely on manufacturer-provided debugging capabilities, instead using a small GSM base station to monitor and catch abnormal behavior through radio link activity.

### Mobile and Feature Phone Bugs
A few bugs have been discovered in feature phones, often by accident. Examples include the "Curse-of-Silence" bug in Symbian OS [44], the WAP-Push vCard bug in Sony Ericsson phones [33], and a bug in Nokia phones [34] that could be exploited to remotely crash the device. These findings motivated our research, as we believed similar vulnerabilities likely exist in other phones.

### Attacks on Mobile Networks
Enck et al. [47] demonstrated that SMS messages sent over the Internet can be used to carry out DoS attacks against mobile networks by blocking control channels. Other studies have explored the use of mobile phone botnets to overload the Home Location Register (HLR) [36]. Our attacks differ in that they directly target handsets without affecting the control channel, causing phones to disconnect and re-authenticate, thereby increasing the load on the network core infrastructure.

### Denial-of-Service Attacks
DoS attacks have been studied in various contexts, including web and DNS [38]. More relevant to our work are attacks that disable real-world systems, such as emergency services [29] and postal services [40].

Our work is unique in focusing on feature phones, which are more widely deployed than smartphones. We present a security testing framework for analyzing SMS implementations on any mobile phone and have used this framework to analyze feature phones from the most popular manufacturers.

## 3. Target Selection
To maximize the impact of our attacks, we targeted the most popular devices. Feature phones dominate the market, accounting for 83% of the U.S. mobile market [10], compared to 16% for smartphones [43]. While smartphone sales are rising, feature phones remain the most prevalent.

Feature phones are defined as mobile phones that are neither dumb phones (with minimal functionality) nor smartphones. They have proprietary operating systems and additional features like music playback, web browsing, and simple applications (mostly J2ME [41]). Despite their limited functionality, they are popular due to their affordability and long battery life.

Technically, feature phones use a single processor for the baseband, applications, and user interface, making them vulnerable to system-wide crashes from a single bug. We selected the top manufacturers—Nokia, Samsung, LG, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, and Micromax—based on market reports [42, 31, 28, 27, 9].

## 4. Security Analysis of Feature Phones
Analyzing feature phones for security vulnerabilities is challenging due to the lack of access to source code, native SDKs, and debugging tools. Therefore, we chose to conduct fuzz-based testing on our own GSM network.

### 4.1 Network Setup
To send large amounts of SMS messages, we built our own GSM network using an ip.access nanoBTS [32], a small, affordable GSM base transceiver station. The BSC part of our setup is driven by OpenBSC [30], a free software implementation of the A-bis protocol. This setup allows us to send SMS messages and monitor the behavior of the phones, ensuring reproducible results and faster message delivery compared to a production network.

Since GSM operates on licensed frequencies, we conducted our experiments in a Faraday cage. This setup enables us to send SMS messages to a mobile phone, either from the telnet interface of OpenBSC or by processing Over-the-Air messages in a store-and-forward fashion.
