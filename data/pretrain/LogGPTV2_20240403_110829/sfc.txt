**Description:**
The `sfc` command scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files. If it detects any corrupted or incorrect versions, it replaces them with the correct versions from the `systemroot\` folder.

**Important:**
- You must be logged in as a member of the Administrators group to run this command.

**Syntax:**
```sh
sfc [/scannow] [/verifyonly] [/scanfile=<file>] [/verifyfile=<file>] 
    [/offwindir=<dir>] [/offbootdir=<dir>] [/offlogfile=<file>]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/scannow**
  - Scans the integrity of all protected system files and attempts to repair any issues found.
  
- **/verifyonly**
  - Scans the integrity of all protected system files but does not perform any repairs.
  
- **/scanfile=\<file>**
  - Scans the specified file (full path and filename) and attempts to repair any detected issues.
  
- **/verifyfile=\<file>**
  - Verifies the integrity of the specified file (full path and filename) without performing any repairs.
  
- **/offwindir=\<dir>**
  - Specifies the location of the offline Windows directory for offline repair.
  
- **/offbootdir=\<dir>**
  - Specifies the location of the offline boot directory for offline repair.
  
- **/offlogfile=\<file>**
  - Specifies a custom location to store the log file, rather than the default location.
  
- **/?**

**Examples:**

- To verify the integrity of the `kernel32.dll` file:
  ```sh
  sfc /verifyfile=C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll
  ```

- To set up an offline repair for the `kernel32.dll` file with the offline boot directory set to `D:` and the offline Windows directory set to `D:\Windows`:
  ```sh
  sfc /scanfile=D:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll /offbootdir=D:\ /offwindir=D:\Windows
  ```
