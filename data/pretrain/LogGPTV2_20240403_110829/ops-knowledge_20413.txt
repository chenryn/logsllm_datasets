I am currently running Linux (version 2.6.18-164.15.1.el5.centos.plus) and attempting to install the `pyodbc` package. When I execute the command `pip install pyodbc`, I encounter a long list of errors, which ultimately end with:

```
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
```

Upon reviewing the log file located at `/root/.pip/pip.log`, I found the following error message:

```
InstallationError: Command /usr/local/bin/python -c "import setuptools; file='/home/build/pyodbc/setup.py'; execfile('/home/build/pyodbc/setup.py')" install --single-version-externally-managed --record /tmp/pip-7MS9Vu-record/install-record.txt failed with error code 1
```

Has anyone else experienced a similar issue while installing `pyodbc`?

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you can try installing the `unixODBC` development libraries, which are required for `pyodbc` to compile successfully. Run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev
```

After installing the `unixodbc-dev` package, you should be able to successfully install `pyodbc` using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pyodbc
```

This approach resolved the installation issue for me.
