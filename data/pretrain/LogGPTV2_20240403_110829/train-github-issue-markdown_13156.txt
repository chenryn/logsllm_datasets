`main.go`:
    package main
    const foo = `
    //+build ignore
    `
Running `vet` produces:
    main.go:3: +build comment must appear before package clause and be followed by a blank line
This also contributes to noise in the vet output for core, e.g.
    ./src/crypto/x509/root_darwin_arm_gen.go:181: +build comment must appear before package clause and be followed by a blank line
    ./src/crypto/x509/root_darwin_arm_gen.go:182: +build comment must appear before package clause and be followed by a blank line
    ./src/crypto/x509/root_darwin_arm_gen.go:183: +build comment must appear before package clause and be followed by a blank line
