# Description of the new feature/enhancement
Allow the users to switch tabs easily like in Edge or other applications that
allow multiple tabs. It will be very helpful to be able to switch tabs. This
is possible in many linux terminals and helps with activity management, where
the user drags the tabs that have long lasting processes to the end.  
Following image describes the feature:
