or acquire hydrogen sulﬁde for the purpose of developing
chemical weapons [4]. While the particularities of chemical
weapons development are far beyond the remit of this paper,
the leakage of such information raises intuitive concerns.
VIII. FINDINGS: PASSENGER AND CREW PRIVACY
Like many large organizations, maritime companies fre-
quently handle sensitive data concerning their customers and
employees. Unlike other large organizations, a signiﬁcant
portion of this data is transmitted over-the-air and, in the
case of VSAT connections, can be physically intercepted by
attackers thousands of miles away. The general susceptibility
of maritime VSAT connections to eavesdropping thus raises
10
identiﬁed within the experimental recordings. This included
deeply sensitive information such as a password reset link
for the Microsoft account belonging to the captain of a
multi-million dollar yacht and candid discussions between oil
company leadership discussing a recent accident leading to the
death of a crew member. That this information was broadcast
in plain-text over an entire continent is deeply concerning.
Email was only one of many contexts in which sensitive
business information was leaked over VSAT connections. For
example, one organization used VSAT linkages to replicate
employee intranet proﬁles across their vessels and, as a result,
leaked hundreds of employee emails, usernames, addresses,
next of kin information, and password hashes. Likewise, more
than 95,000 unencrypted FTP sessions were observed many of
which were used to propagate updated information about crew
members and user accounts across an entire ﬂeet. Although
encrypted alternatives to these protocols are widely available,
many maritime organizations do not employ them in practice.
One encryption protocol was widely employed, with TLS
ranking as the third most common protocol in our dataset.
However, even in this case, a cursory analysis identiﬁed
frequent issues within implementations. Of the approximately
30 million TLS sessions observed, around 9% used cipher
protocols generally considered to be weak or insecure [37].
Restricting the analysis to only “internal” trafﬁc local to the
maritime VSAT network, the prevalence of weak or insecure
cipher suites increased substantially to 36%. Legal constraints
prevented closer investigation into the practical exploitability
of these ciphers but future work here may prove fruitful.
IX. ACTIVE ATTACKS
Beyond passive eavesdropping, an attacker may also wish
to directly interfere with active VSAT communications links.
However, for a low-resourced adversary,
there are several
barriers to doing so.
First, the non-broadcast components of the feed (e.g. the
uplink connection from the ship to a satellite, or the downlink
connection from the satellite to a ground-station) are highly
directional signals. To intercept or spoof these components
would likely require the use of aerial vehicles sitting in the
line-of-sight from a vessel
to the satellite or ships which
have been strategically deployed to listen on antenna side-
lobes from the VSAT dish located on a target vessel. More-
over, successfully replicating the modulation states and signal
characteristics of a satellite feed in real time would require
access to expensive and sophisticated radio equipment. Given
these constraints, the threat of an active attacker in VSAT
environments has historically been of little concern.
A. TCP Session Hijacking
Using our experimental setup, we successfully demon-
strated the capability of an attacker to arbitrarily modify trafﬁc
in a real-world maritime VSAT environment through TCP
session hijacking. While the process of TCP hijacking is well
understood, these attacks are rarely practical in terrestrial ISP
networks due to challenging race-conditions.
The unique physical properties of satellite networks offer a
substantial change to this threat model as an attacker is almost

serious privacy concerns and suggests that maritime VSAT
trafﬁc may be a target for cyber-criminals and identity thieves.
For example, ships crossing international borders must
maintain information regarding the visa and passport details
of their passengers and crew members. This data is frequently
transmitted along ship-to-shore links in anticipation of arrival
at a given port. Despite the sensitivity of this data, in a single
24 hour window, we were able to ﬁnd more than a dozen
instances of complete passport details transmitted in plain-text
across VSAT connections (Figure 17).
Consumer-oriented maritime businesses, such as ferries and
cruise ships, rely on the ability to sell goods and services to
passengers as a component of their revenue stream. As such,
they must handle and verify credit-card payment details while
at sea and VSAT technology is used to facilitate this service.
Figure 18 depicts one of more than 12,000 messages observed
from on-board credit card readers captured during the study.
Reverse engineering the communications protocol employed
by these machines was beyond the scope of this project, but
the presence of this trafﬁc suggests that sensitive ﬁnancial data
may not be adequately protected over VSAT links. Similar
issues with secure transaction handling have been previously
identiﬁed in the aviation sector over an unrelated terrestrial
radio protocol [41]. This suggests that, despite the general
availability of encryption technology for sensitive data, a lack
of customer awareness regarding data link security for esoteric
and domain-speciﬁc contexts may cultivate risky practices.

handheld credit card reader belonging to a major cruise line.
More than 12,000 such messages appeared in the study.
Internal network trafﬁc relating to the business operations
of a maritime organization may also contain deeply sensitive
information. While the majority of email protocol trafﬁc was
encrypted, more than 130,000 unencrypted email sessions were
11
guaranteed to “win” the race to hijack the session (Figure 19).
Speed-of-light delays over the satellite link are signiﬁcant. For
the 425 publicly routable hosts in our captures, the mean
round trip time (RTT) was approximately 725 ms and the
median RTT approximately 700 ms. This grants an attacker
around 350 ms to send their malicious TCP responses. Even
under ideal theoretical conditions, RTTs to geostationary orbit
measure upwards of 500 ms.
B. TCP Hijacking Requirements
A maritime VSAT network is only vulnerable to TCP
hijacking attacks under certain conditions.
Firstly, an attacker must determine public IP routes to
both ends of a targeted TCP conversation. Generally,
this
requires vessels within the network to have public IP addresses.
However, it may also be possible to identify IP mappings
through a Network Address Translation (NAT), albeit with
signiﬁcantly more effort. For example, in the experimental
captures, public IP routes to internal hosts were occasionally
leaked inside SMB ﬁle paths and HTTP headers. Interestingly,
many of these leaks originated from malware trafﬁc scanning
for vulnerable hosts, indicating that an organizational policy to
use encrypted application layer protocols (e.g. HTTPS) may
not be sufﬁcient to fully hide IP mappings.
Unique to satellite ecosystems, there is also the risk that the
observed TCP session over the air is not the same session as
that observed by the receiving vessel and internet endpoint.
This is due to the use of Performance Enhancing Proxies
(PEPs). PEPs modify TCP connections and generate artiﬁcial
ACK responses in the TCP three-way handshake in order to
prevent high latency from being misinterpreted as a sign of
network congestion by the TCP protocol.
PEPs can vary signiﬁcantly. First, they may modify trafﬁc
at either the client, the ISP gateway, or both. Additionally they
can either “split” trafﬁc into distinct TCP sessions generating
unique sequence numbers and handshakes for both sides or
“snoop” into TCP sessions, operating invisibly and preserving
TCP header information across the entire link. In the former
case, TCP session numbers transmitted over the satellite link
may not be the same as TCP session numbers expected by
either or both of the session endpoints. This can either prevent
a hijacking attack entirely (if the connection is “split” into three
hops), or limit attacks to a single direction (if the connection
is “split” into only two hops).
In our study, approximately 425 hosts, or around 5% of
observed hosts, had publicly routable IP addresses. However,
this is likely not a representative ratio as the provisioning
of public IP addresses varies substantially between VSAT
providers. Among 11 other VSAT service providers which
were considered but not selected for long-term recordings,
approximately a third provided clients with publicly routable
IP addresses. For legal and ethical reasons, we did not attempt
to ﬁngerprint PEP software on individual hosts as this requires
active port scanning and connections to customer endpoints.
C. Hijacking Implementation
To hijack TCP sessions, GSExtract monitors live VSAT
trafﬁc for TCP SYN connections from a speciﬁed internet host
(a) A TCP-SYN packet and associated sequence number sent from
the terrestrial back ofﬁce arrives at both the legitimate recipient and
the eavesdropper simultaneously.
(b) The attacker generates a SYN-ACK response with the received
sequence number and transmits it over a low-latency wired internet
connection. Meanwhile, the legitimate recipient also generates a SYN-
ACK response and sends it via the VSAT link. Due to speed-of-light
effects, the attacker’s response is virtually guaranteed to arrive ﬁrst.
At this point, the attacker has hijacked the TCP conversation.
Fig. 19: Notional Overview of TCP-Hijacking in VSAT
to a speciﬁed VSAT target. It extracts the appropriate sequence
number from this intercepted data and uses it to transmit
an artiﬁcial TCP SYN-ACK response to the internet host.
This malicious response reaches the internet host hundreds
of milliseconds before the legitimate response completes its
70,000 km journey through geostationary orbit. A similar
process is used to intercept the ﬁnal ACK response of the
three-way handshake and all subsequent TCP packets.
In order to responsibly assess this threat in a real-world
VSAT network, we elected to hijack our own attempted
connection to a closed TCP port aboard a remote vessel.
Speciﬁcally, we generated malicious responses to our own
HTTP requests sent to an IP address located within the VSAT
environment. This allowed us to successfully generate trafﬁc
which appeared to be from a web server running aboard a
vessel operating within the customer network. This sort of
attack could be used to falsely report location details or other
ship status information to a terrestrial operations center.
TCP session hijacking also enables other attack vectors, in-
cluding command injection into telnet sessions and man-in-the
middle attacks on certain SSH conﬁgurations. In the context
of our aforementioned ﬁndings, TCP hijacking may represent
a mechanism for maliciously altering ECDIS navigational
charts, NM alerts, AIS area reports, or other operationally
vital information. Additionally, a trivial denial of service attack
12
SYN,SEQSYN,SEQSYN-ACK,SEQSYN-ACK,SEQSYN-ACK,SEQ~70ms~350msSYN-ACK,SEQcan be achieved through the introduction of malicious TCP
RST packets. An attacker could thus signiﬁcantly reduce the
reliability of all TCP connections to a maritime vessel. It may
even be possible for an attacker to completely block TCP
connectivity to a ship at sea.
We have only assessed our ability to intercept incoming
to a host within the VSAT
connections from the internet
network. We did not
interfere with any legitimate uplink
connections from vessels as this risked interrupting critical
communications and causing harm to end users. Nevertheless,
we expect this attack would work equally well for intercepting
uplink connections from satellite hosts to the broader internet.
While in this direction the attacker’s latency advantage would
be reduced, the attacker would still have the time advantage
of being able to reply immediately to the customer’s request
rather than routing the request over the open internet and
awaiting a response. This suggests an eavesdropper may gain
full-duplex access to VSAT TCP streams, despite having the
capability to intercept only half of the connection over radio.
D. Further Active Attacks
Beyond TCP hijacking, other active attacks against VSAT
systems appear intuitively possible. For example, at
least
30,000 HTTP conversations with session tokens were identiﬁed
and may be vulnerable in HTTP hijacking attacks. Similarly,
DNS responses are regularly observed over the VSAT feed,
while predicting DNS queries may be difﬁcult (as these are
sent over the uplink and thus not observed in signal captures),
certain operating systems (such as older versions of Windows)
generate predictable DNS transaction IDs and could accept a
malicious response [32]. Further work assessing active attacks
in maritime VSAT is likely warranted. However, this would re-
quire cooperation from VSAT customers and service providers.
X. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Increased awareness within the maritime industry is a vital
ﬁrst step to addressing these issues. Based on the content of
observed trafﬁc in this study, it appears that maritime VSAT
customers are unaware that outsiders can listen in to trafﬁc on
their networks especially when this trafﬁc is logically routed
within a LAN environment. In many cases, these issues would
be substantially mitigated through the use of application-layer
encrypted alternatives, such as requiring the use of TLS for
POP3 email sessions or HTTPS for internal web trafﬁc.
However, deeper issues such as the TCP hijacking and de-
nial of service threat or application ﬁngerprinting through the
identiﬁcation of TLS certiﬁcates are more difﬁcult to resolve.
While VPNs represent an intuitive solution, standard VPN
products are incompatible with the aforementioned perfor-
mance enhancing proxies (PEPs) which are vital to maintaining
usable speeds in VSAT environments [36], [18]. Latency in
TCP trafﬁc is treated as an indication of network congestion
and thus TCP conversations in satellite environments take
much longer to maximize use of available bandwidth. As
a result, ISPs use PEPs to alter TCP headers and generate
fake TCP ACK packets on the ﬂy. VPNs prevent the deep-
packet inspection necessary to perform these tasks. As such,
further research into a link-layer security protocol suitable to
the particularities of VSAT environments is likely warranted.
While some proprietary solutions exist, these implemen-
tations are not well studied and their security properties are
unveriﬁed beyond marketing claims [43]. Academic proposals
have also been made, particularly around MPEG-TS based
communications in the early 2000s, but these have not been
updated for newer DVB-S2 and GSE standards [13]. Industry
proposals for securing scientiﬁc space missions show promise
but lack the key-management infrastructure and multiplex-
ing capabilities for multi-user environments [7]. As such, a
veriﬁable and open standard for modern encrypted satellite
broadband is much needed both within the maritime VSAT
context and more broadly.
In the shorter term, especially for sensitive information
of the nature outlined in our case studies, maritime VSAT
customers may need to accept the signiﬁcant performance costs
of employing IPSec and other end-to-end tunneling techniques
over VSAT connections. Higher latency connections may not
be desirable from a user-experience perspective, but they are
preferable to an alternative which endangers ship and crew.
XI. CONCLUSION
Historically, high costs of access to equipment and esoteric
nature of maritime satellite protocols may have acted as
signiﬁcant barriers to entry for threat actors. However, this
is no longer the case.
By leveraging inexpensive and widely available satellite
television equipment, we have demonstrated that an attacker
can eavesdrop on many marine VSAT connections at less than
1% of traditional equipment costs. Further, we have presented
GSExtract, a forensic tool which enables the recovery and
extraction of signiﬁcant quantities of valid IP trafﬁc from
highly corrupted and incomplete GSE transponder streams.
These tools were tested in a real-world environment and used
to observe four major maritime VSAT streams providing cov-
erage to Europe and the North Atlantic together encompassing
more than 26 million square kilometers of coverage area. These
providers all employ an underlying technology stack used by
more than 60% of the global maritime VSAT service industry.
Through this experimental analysis, we discovered that
status-quo maritime VSAT networks lack basic link-layer
encryption. These issues were contextualized vis-a-vis their
impacts on the safe navigation and operation of vessels and
the security and privacy of passengers and crew. Further,
we demonstrated the ability to even deny or modify certain
ship-to-shore communications depending on VSAT network
conﬁguration. In short, the insecure nature of maritime VSAT
enables a number of novel threats to marine vessels which may
be exploited by a wide-range of relevant threat actors including
pirates, criminals, and terrorists.
Our experimental ﬁndings suggest that the status quo poses
signiﬁcant risks to some of the world’s largest and most vital
maritime organizations. To the extent that maritime operators
are unaware of the risk exposure caused by eavesdropping
attacks on ship-to-shore communications links, we hope this
paper is a ﬁrst step towards characterizing the threat. Moreover,
we suggest the use of common encryption technologies in the
short-term and the need for bespoke protocols in the longer
term which handle the unique latency constraints of satellite
networking environments.
