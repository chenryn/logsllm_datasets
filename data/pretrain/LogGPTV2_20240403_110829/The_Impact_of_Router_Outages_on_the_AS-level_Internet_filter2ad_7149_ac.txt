by traceroute. The first router belonging to the destination AS
has a distance of zero, routers with negative distance are within
the destination AS; routers with positive distance are before the
destination AS. The first router in the destination AS will often
appear in traceroute using an address assigned by their provider
for the interconnecting link. Therefore, we infer the destination
AS border router in traceroute is the hop prior to the first hop that
used an address BGP-originated by the destination AS.
4.3 Correlating with BGP Control Plane
We used the University of Oregon’s Routeviews archived routing
table snapshots and update messages to provide a BGP-level view
of routing. We ingested into a Cassandra time series database RIB
snapshots at midnight UTC for each day from 18 January 2015
to 30 May 2017, as well as all update messages between each RIB
snapshot. We used all peers providing data to the “routeviews6”
collector, where multiple Tier-1 IPv6 ISPs provide a global view of
routing from their perspectives, including AT&T, Verizon, Hurri-
cane Electric, CenturyLink, GTT Communications, and NTT.

experienced an outage. 71% had less than ten outages during
our probing.
the discontinuity is larger than an order of magnitude more than
the expected change, and the sequence is non-random, we infer a
cyclic reboot.
Our method allows us to infer an outage window – a period
of time in which the router restarted. Figure 3 shows the mini-
mum and maximum outage window lengths for each address that
was monotonic or cyclic during our probing. At least half of the
maximum outage windows were shorter than 31 minutes, though
another 22% of the windows were at least 2 hours, and 4% of the
maximum outage windows in our dataset were more than 24 hours.
Figure 4 shows the number of router outages inferred per router,
for those routers that had at least one inferred outage. We inferred
24% of these routers had one outage during our measurements,
53% had four outages, and 71% had fewer than ten outages during
our probing. These short and infrequent outages is consistent with
these devices operating as critical infrastructure.
Figure 5 shows the daily number of rebooting routers. There is
some decay in the number of reboots we inferred per day between
January 2015 and February 2017, as our router sample was mostly
static over this time period, and some routers became unrespon-
sive. Because routers rarely restart owing to their nature as critical
infrastructure, a low-rate probing balances our ability to capture
outages from the probing cost in doing so.

Figure 6: Computing distance of router reboot from AS an-
nouncing route in BGP. A router with distance zero is likely
to be the AS’s border router, a router with negative distance
is within the AS, and a router with positive distance is out-
side the AS.
Figure 7: Correlating router outages with BGP control plane
(W)ithdrawal and (A)nnouncements. More router outage
windows in our data contain withdrawals, rather than with-
drawals before or announcements after outage windows.
A router outage can manifest itself in the BGP control plane in
four different ways, depending on the number of routes advertised
by that router to neighboring BGP routers that were selected as
the best path. Because of the information-hiding properties of BGP,
where only the best route is advertised to external peers, a router
outage topologically close to the advertised prefix is more likely
to result in control plane activity because it is more likely to be in
the best path for neighboring ASes. In this work, we consider four
event types, and we empirically correlate them in time and distance
from the AS announcing the route.
Event Types: First, a complete withdrawal occurs when a router
that has an outage is present in all external BGP paths towards the
prefix. In this work, we classify a prefix as being completely with-
drawn if no vantage point has a route for 70 consecutive seconds.
A complete withdrawal occurs when the router is a single point of
failure for that prefix. Second, a partial withdrawal occurs when
a router that has an outage does not cause all VPs to withdraw
the route, but at least some do withdraw, each for 70 consecutive
seconds. A partial withdrawal can occur when some VPs carry the
route, but other VPs do not converge on the same path because they
did not receive it through the export policy of other ASes. In this
work, we also observed individual Routeviews looking glass peers
carrying routes while all others withdrew the prefix for multiple
hours, masking a complete withdrawal. Third, churn occurs when a
router that has an outage is present in the path for some peers, but
those peers were able to converge on an alternative route during
the outage. Finally, no BGP activity can occur during a router outage
when other equal cost paths are available with the same AS path,
so no BGP control message is required.
Time Effects: Figure 7 shows the four ways that a router out-
age can correlate in time with a BGP withdrawal. First, and most
common in our data, the withdrawal event is contained within
the router outage window. Specifically, the time that the last peer
withdraws is after the left edge of the outage window and the time
that the first peer announces is before the right edge of the out-
age window. This is the most common effect in our data, as most
withdrawals more than 70 seconds in length were still less than the
approximate 15-minute probing intervals of our prober. We believe
these short withdrawals are mostly caused by operators upgrading
the software and rebooting the router.
Second, outage-contained occurs when the operator shuts down
all BGP sessions with the router’s peers before restarting the router,
and the sessions come back up after we detected the router outage
ended. Because of our 15-minute granularity of probing, we likely
missed some outage-contained correlations. Third, withdraw-before
occurs when the operator shuts down all BGP sessions with the
router’s peers before restarting the router, we probe the router be-
fore it restarts, and the router restarts BGP sessions with neighbors
before we probe the router again. Finally, announce-after occurs
when the first announcement after the outage occurs after we de-
tected the router had restarted.
Distance Effects: Figure 8 shows the effect of an inferred router
outage on BGP control plane activity for outages occurring during
February 2015. We counted each reboot/prefix pair once, to reduce
the effect that a few routers with frequent outages could have.
The closer the router is to the destination AS, the more likely the
outage will result in BGP churn and prefix withdrawal. In particular,
10% of border routers operated by a destination AS resulted in a
complete withdrawal. We investigate the nature of these outages
thoroughly in §5; we include figure 8 here to provide evidence that
our technique yields reasonable inferences.
Figure 8 also includes withdrawal and churn measurements for
the six-hour period before the router outage for the same outage
window length, as a control. In the control figure, there is substan-
tially less BGP activity for the affected prefixes, and there were no
withdrawals of the prefixes lasting at least 70 seconds. We therefore
believe the elevated level of churn and withdrawals were caused
by the inferred router outages.

(a) During Router Outage
(b) Six Hours Before Router Outage
Figure 8: Impact of router outages on BGP routing during an inferred router outage as a function of distance the router is from
the border router of the destination AS, and a control of six hours before the outage for the same duration, during February
2015. A router outage was more likely to correlate with churn and withdrawal the closer the router is to the border of the AS.
While the IPID velocity for a particular router may typically be
low, any probing system must handle large bursts of control traffic,
for instance when the router is exchanging routing information, or
when the router is polled by a management system. Conservatively
assuming a maximum control-plane transmission rate of 100Mbps
and 1500 byte packets, the Nyquist rate dictates that each router
must be probed approximately once every four seconds. While prior
work has shown the feasibility of high-rate IPID probing [8], the
scale required for Internet-wide uptime monitoring precludes IPv4
probing. Further, such a probing rate is effectively equivalent to
high-rate reachability probing, and yet it would still be impossible
to differentiate any period of unreachability from an actual reboot.
Requires incrementing IPID. Even when restricting our tech-
nique to routers with IPv6 interfaces, our method only works for
those routers that respond and send fragments with an IPID value
assigned from a counter. Therefore, our method is only able to de-
tect a fraction of all router outages in the Internet. In prior work, we
found that routers manufactured by Cisco, Huawei, Vyatta, HP, and
Mikrotik returned sequential fragment identifiers [33]. However,
routers manufactured by Juniper return random identifiers.
Figure 9: The fraction of Routeviews peers that withdrew
a prefix when not all peers withdrew. 10% of router-prefix
pairs had nearly all peers withdraw the prefix.
Figure 9 shows the fraction of peers that withdrew a prefix when
not all peers withdrew a prefix. As with figure 8, we only plot each
router/prefix pair once. For half of the pairs, only 1-2 peers withdrew
a prefix; however, 10% of pairs had nearly all peers withdraw the
prefix, but did not meet the criteria for a full withdrawal.
4.4 Limitations
Measurement of network resilience at the router-level is fraught
with challenges because the available data is imperfect. In this
section, we discuss the most important challenges and limitations.
Limited to IPv6. Our IPID reboot inference is limited to probing
routers with an IPv6 interface. While IPv4 packets also contain an
IPID field, and router implementations frequently reset the IPID
counter to zero and populate the IPID field monotonically, there
are two fundamental problems with using the IPID for IPv4 reboot
inference. First, whereas IPID is an optional extension header in
IPv6, IPID is a required IPv4 header value, so every IPv4 control-
plane packet requires a unique value. Many routers therefore have
high IPID velocity due to their participation in routing protocols and
network management. Second, whereas the IPID is a 32-bit counter
in IPv6, it is only 16-bits in IPv4. High-velocities combined with
small counters imply that we would have to frequently sample the
IPv4 counter to avoid misinterpreting a counter-wrap as a reboot.
Complex events could be masked. Our method might incor-
rectly associate a complex event, such as a power outage causing
multiple simultaneous router outages, with a single router. While
we can detect multiple overlapping router outages when the routers
involved all assign IPID values from a counter, we were unable to
detect this complex event if only one router involved assigns IPID
values from a counter. Further, we were only able to probe routers
observed in traceroute; other routers only on a backup path that
simultaneously failed were therefore not probed.
BGP dynamics can mask single points of failure. Correctly
inferring a router is a single point of failure is challenging due
to the complexities in topology, routing, and configuration. As
discussed in §2, BGP routers can use a MRAI timer to reduce churn
during path exploration by not announcing a route for a prefix
more regularly than the timer, and operators may deploy route
flap damping to further suppress updates. Routers may use a MRAI
timer of 30 seconds, though large transit networks often reduce the

timer to allow faster convergence. In this work, we inferred that
a Routeviews peer had no route if the peer did not report a route
for the prefix for at least 70 seconds, which allows for two default
MRAI timer values, as well as a 10-second fudge. Router outages
that completed more quickly than 70 seconds would be classified
as churn, understating the importance of the router to that prefix.
Infrequent update of destination prefixes. Prior to Febru-
ary 2017, the set of destination prefixes used to seed CAIDA’s IPv6
traceroute data collection was infrequently updated – every few
months, rather than continuously as new IPv6 prefixes were an-
nounced. Our process to associate network prefixes to routers (§4.2)
requires traceroutes towards an address in the prefix in order to es-
tablish a dependence between a router that appears in a traceroute
and a corresponding prefix.
4.5 Validation
We contacted operators at six different networks for validation of
our inferences. We focused on operators of research and education
(R&E) networks, as we believed they would be willing to provide
feedback on our work. Further, we believed they would be willing
to refer us to their customer network operators, in the cases where
only the customer could supply ground truth on the root cause of
the outage. Five operators responded, and four provided feedback;
the fifth declined to provide feedback without permission of the
members involved, and the sixth did not respond to our request.
We asked the operators to validate that our reboot inferences
were correct (true positives), and that we did not miss any reboots
(false negatives). We also asked the operators to validate our single
point of failure inferences; for routers where we did not detect
any full withdrawals, we asked them to confirm the routers were
not a single point of failure. Table 2 summarizes the validation
outcome. The validation shows the technique is able to correctly
infer router reboot windows when the router assigns IPID values
from a counter. Where the operators were able to, they confirmed
we did not miss any outages; however, the operators had difficulty
confirming outages prior to the last outage. Our technique is also
usually able to correctly infer dependence of a prefix on a router.
US University: We contacted the network operator of a large
campus network for feedback on six different routers that had re-
booted. In total, we detected 15 reboots associated with the routers,
and no prefix withdrawals correlated with any of the reboots. They
