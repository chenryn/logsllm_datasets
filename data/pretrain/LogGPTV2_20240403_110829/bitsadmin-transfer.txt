bitsadmin transfer
Transfers one or more files. By default, the BITSAdmin service creates a download job that runs at NORMAL priority and updates the command window with progress information until the transfer is complete or until a critical error occurs,
The service completes the job if it successfully transfers all the files and cancels the job if a critical error occurs. The service does not create the job if it is unable to add files to the job or if you specify an invalid value for type or job_priority. To transfer more than one file, specify multiple - pairs. The pairs must be space-delimited.

Note
The BITSAdmin command continues to run if a transient error occurs. To end the command, press CTRL+C.
