### Bitsadmin Transfer

The `bitsadmin transfer` command is used to transfer one or more files. By default, the BITSAdmin service creates a download job that runs at NORMAL priority and updates the command window with progress information until the transfer is complete or a critical error occurs.

- **Completion**: The service completes the job if all files are successfully transferred.
- **Cancellation**: The job is canceled if a critical error occurs.
- **Job Creation**: The service will not create the job if it is unable to add files to the job or if an invalid value is specified for the `type` or `job_priority` parameters.
- **Multiple Files**: To transfer more than one file, specify multiple `-` pairs, which must be space-delimited.

**Note**: The BITSAdmin command continues to run if a transient error occurs. To end the command, press `CTRL+C`.

#### Syntax
```sh
bitsadmin /transfer <name> <type> <priority> <ACLflags> [/DYNAMIC] <remotefilename> <localfilename>
```

#### Parameters
- **name**: The name of the job. This cannot be a GUID.
- **type** (Optional): Sets the type of job:
  - `/DOWNLOAD`: Default value. Choose this for download jobs.
  - `/UPLOAD`: Choose this for upload jobs.
- **priority** (Optional): Sets the priority of the job:
  - `FOREGROUND`
  - `HIGH`
  - `NORMAL` (Default)
  - `LOW`
- **ACLflags** (Optional): Indicates that you want to maintain the owner and ACL information with the file being downloaded. Specify one or more of the following values:
  - `o`: Copy owner information with the file.
  - `g`: Copy group information with the file.
  - `d`: Copy discretionary access control list (DACL) information with the file.
  - `s`: Copy system access control list (SACL) information with the file.
- **/DYNAMIC**: Configures the job using `BITS_JOB_PROPERTY_DYNAMIC_CONTENT`, which relaxes the server-side requirements.
- **remotefilename**: The name of the file after it is transferred to the server.
- **localfilename**: The name of the file that resides locally.

#### Examples
To start a transfer job named `myDownloadJob`:
```sh
bitsadmin /transfer myDownloadJob /DOWNLOAD http://prodserver/audio.wma c:\downloads\audio.wma
```

This example will create a download job named `myDownloadJob` to transfer the file `audio.wma` from `http://prodserver/` to the local directory `c:\downloads\`.
