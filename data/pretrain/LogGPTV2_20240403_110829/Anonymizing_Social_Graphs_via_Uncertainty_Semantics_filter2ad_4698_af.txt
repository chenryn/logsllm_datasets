APPENDIX
Proof: For power-law graphs, the node degree distribution
in B∞RW is the
ζ(γ). The number of selﬂoops nP L

To prove that there is no multiedge in B∞RW we show that
all elements in B∞RW are less than 1. This is equivalent to
show dmax  1 and we consider γ >

Similar to the case of PL graphs, we show that dmax  λ we get
λk ≤ ne−λ < n, so k < n2/kλ2 < √nλ = √2m as long as
me = 0.
n is sufﬁciently large and λ ≥ 4. So we conclude nER

B. Proof of theorem 5.1
Proof: We prove the result by induction.
When k = 1, we have two cases of G1: EG1 = {e1} and
EG1 = ∅. For both cases, V ar[D(G1, G1)] = p1(1 − p1), i.e.
independent of G1.
Assume that the result is correct up to k − 1 edges, i.e.
V ar[D(Gk−1, Gk−1)] = Pk−1
i=1 pi(1 − pi) for all Gk−1 ⊑
Gk−1, we need to prove that it is also correct for k edges.
We use the subscript notations Gk, Gk for the case of k edges.
We consider two cases of Gk: ek ∈ Gk and ek /∈ Gk.
Case 1. The formula for V ar[D(Gk, Gk)] is
V ar[D(Gk, Gk)] = XG′
