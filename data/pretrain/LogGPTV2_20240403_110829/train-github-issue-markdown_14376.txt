Hi, we are glad you can fix this issue to become a contributor to Apache
Sharding Sphere.  
Welcome! ðŸ˜ƒ
By doing this assignment, you can learn more about how a query SQL is parsed
and how to verify the parsing result of a SQL in Apache ShardingSphere.
This issue is to add the parsing assertion for `ParameterMarkerExpression` by
adding the start-index and stop-index attributes in parsing-result.xml.
It is not difficult, and the following comment also gives you the detailed
instruction. BTW, if you need any help, please be free to reply to this one.
