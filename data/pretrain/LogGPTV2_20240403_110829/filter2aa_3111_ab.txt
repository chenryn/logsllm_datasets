Previous research[5] addressed using keyboard acoustic in order to mount a 
statistical attack for decoding the keystrokes, while these attacks are 
extremely fascinating we wanted to test something different that can be used 
at longer ranges.
Laser microphones are well known monitoring devices that can detect sound at 
great distances by measuring the mechanical vibration of glass windows 
(which resonate due to the sound waves that hit them).
The theory is that the mechanical vibration produced by keystrokes 
propagates on the laptop case carrying information that can be used to 
decode them. A laser microphone can be pointed at the laptop case directly 
instead of a window in order to sample those vibrations in a fashion similar 
to sound detection (effectively making the laser microphone a laser 
"vibrational sampler" as no sound is involved).
--[ 10. Second Attack - Implementation
While several commercial laser microphones are available at a high price, it 
is fairly easy to build your own for as little as 80 USD.
Here's the basic needed equipment:
   1 x Laser
   1 x Photoresistor or Photodiode
   1 x Variable resistor
   1 x AA Battery
   1 x Universal Power Adapter
   1 x Jack Cable
   1 x Laptop with sound card
   2 x Tripod
   1 x Focusing lens (for long distances)
Optional components can include an amplifier and/or an optical bandpass 
filter.
We built a basic laser device with a cheap Class IIIR laser (670 nm,  \         \

In order to test if the assembled device works correctly a good method is 
using it as a "normal" laser microphone against a window, if the device is 
tuned for detecting audio it will be good enough for vibration pattern 
detection.
--[ 11. Second Attack - Data Analysis
The vibration patterns received by the device clearly show the separate 
keystrokes, this means that previous research that involves analyzing the 
timing of the keystrokes can be reused with this method.
In addition, as the vibrational information is precise enough, we can 
compare the patterns to each other in order to assess the likelihood of the 
different keystrokes being the same (or different). This allows recovery of 
recurrent/distinct letters within the words and eventually the entire text 
which is being typed.
As the space bar is a key shaped in a substantially different manner than 
any other key on they keyboard layout, it is immediately possible to 
separate the words from each other. This greatly helps the data analysis as 
by making assumptions on the language which is being typed it is possible to 
narrow down the odds of small words and re-use that information throughout 
the analysis (as an example 3 letter words in English are likely to be 
either 'are' or 'the').
As the different vibration patterns are not going to be identical because of 
difference in typing speed and mechanical propagation a scoring technique is 
necessary for the comparison. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a good old-
fashioned technique for measuring the similarity of signals with different 
time/speed, it is generally applied to audio and video but in principle can 
be used with any signal.
More modern statistical techniques exist, like Hidden Markov Model (HMM), 
and can be surely employed with the same, if better, effectiveness.
It is important to emphasize that this attack doesn't requires previous 
knowledge or training about the victim (other than the language) as we 
perform the statistical comparison between the different keys of the same 
sniffed data. Knowing the context of the text it is possible to considerably 
narrow down the options with just a few words of data.
Additionally the order of the typed sequences is not a factor, as an example 
if someone types a password and then a page of text the latter analysis can 
be used to narrow down the options for guessing the password.
--[ 12. Second Attack - Results
From a signal detection point of view it was possible to obtain good results 
below 30 meters without any heavy tuning, using the cheap laser. Longer 
distances requires precise calibration and filtering and of course the more 
money is thrown at the laser quality the better the range is going to be.
Aiming the beam directly at the laptop case, generally the LCD display lid, 
proves to be effective. The top of the lid catches more resonant vibrations 
(to be subtracted later via signal analysis) while aiming closer to the 
hinges produces better results.
Here's a sample result dump from a pessimistic case scenario of just two 
words being typed:
  chars 1 <> 7  = 0.066*  chars 7 <> 8  = 0.029*  chars 8 <> 7  = 0.029*
  chars 1 <> 8  = 0.072*  chars 7 <> 1  = 0.066*  chars 8 <> 1  = 0.072*
  chars 1 <> 3  = 0.167   chars 7 <> 3  = 0.161   chars 8 <> 3  = 0.146
  chars 1 <> 10 = 0.188   chars 7 <> 10 = 0.191   chars 8 <> 6  = 0.226
  chars 1 <> 6  = 0.209   chars 7 <> 6  = 0.270   chars 8 <> 10 = 0.244
  chars 6 <> 10 = 0.160*  chars 10 <> 6 = 0.160*  chars 11 <> 1  = 0.065*
  chars 6 <> 1  = 0.209   chars 10 <> 7 = 0.191   chars 11 <> 8  = 0.029*
  chars 6 <> 8  = 0.226   chars 10 <> 1 = 0.188   chars 11 <> 7  = 0.072*
  chars 6 <> 7  = 0.270   chars 10 <> 8 = 0.244   chars 11 <> 3  = 0.146
  chars 6 <> 3  = 0.343   chars 10 <> 3 = 0.250   chars 11 <> 6  = 0.226
The lower the score the better the match. Characters 1, 7, 8 and 11 are 
definitely identical like 6 and 10 while characters 3 and 4 looks different 
than anything else.
Knowing where the space bar was we can group the different keys with the 
following pattern of 1?XY321 1321.
Here's what happens if we input the result to a very simple application that 
performs regular expression pattern matching against a dictionary using the 
supplied grouping.
$ ./WoF '1_XY321 1321' /usr/share/dict/american-english
  hogwash hash
  salmons sons
  secrets sets
  sermons sons
  sockets sets
  soviets sets
  statues sues
  straits sits
  subways says
  tempest test
  tidiest test
  tiniest test
  trident tent
We can see that knowing the context it is immediately possible to assess 
that 'tempest test' and maybe 'secrets sets' are the most probable answers, 
and indeed the former is the correct one.
Adding an article to the phrase (like 'the') narrows downs the options to 
just two possibilities. With a full page of text, while the matching process 
takes more time, it is easily possible to recover the entire text.
--[ 13. Second Attack - Attack Scenario and Workarounds
Obviously a line of sight is needed, either in front or above the target, 
for mounting the attack. While this is not trivial to achieve it is 
reasonably possible if the target is facing a window on a high floor or 
placed on a table in a location (an outdoor area as an example) where the 
attacker can reach higher grounds. The transmitting and receiving sides can 
be at two completely different locations.
A reflective area is needed for the attack and we found out that almost 
every laptop has a usable area. In case of IBM Thinkpads the logo on the lid 
can be used as well as the reflective plastic antenna for later models, Asus 
netbooks lid is entirely reflective and hence perfect for the attack. Apple 
laptops can be targeted on the Apple logo itself or, if you are attacking 
from behind, on the ultra-glossy screen.
Additionally it is possible to aim the laser at any reflective object 
present on the laptop support like glasses close to the laptop and so on, if 
the table is sufficiently elastic to propagate the vibrations the attack is 
successful.
While one laser device was used in our tests it is possible to combine more 
of them and have 2 or 4 devices aiming the same laptop simultaneously, it is 
also possible to use different kind of laser microphones that use 
interferometry in order to assess the Doppler effect of the frequency shift 
caused by the vibration. All of this can greatly help the measurement for 
longer ranges.
Stealthiness (as red laser dots on your laptop case might look suspicious 
now) can be easily achieved by using an infrared laser/receiving diode, 
though it might require an infrared camera or temporary guidance with a 
visible laser for the actual targeting.
The attack is possible even with a (possibly double) glass window in the way 
as reflection loss is ~4% at every pass.
As a workaround (other than avoiding the line of sight with the attacker in 
the first place) the only ways we can think of are using an extremely firm 
laptop (we have yet to find a model which satisfy this requirement), 
radically change position while typing every second or so (you might look 
weird while doing this) or "pollute" the data with random keys somehow and 
delete them with backspace afterwards.
--[ I. FAQ                                  
1. Where are the pretty pictures? I see only ASCII art here.
Check the links section down below for the full pdf presentation with all 
the pictures.
2. In the first attack can you detect different keyboards being used on the 
same electric line?
Yes, the PS/2 frequency is a range and it is very difficult to find two 
keyboards at exactly the same frequency. Unless you have thousands of 
keyboards it will be possible to differentiate them.
3. In the second attack does the result change if different people are 
typing?
Yes it does, in the sense that every person typing style will produce 
different vibrational patterns even for the same laptop. At the end though 
this is not a factor for the attack success as the analysis is assumed to be 
performed for a data set coming from the same person.
It is not possible to re-use the scoring from one person against a different 
one (unless we are talking about two identical evil twins)
