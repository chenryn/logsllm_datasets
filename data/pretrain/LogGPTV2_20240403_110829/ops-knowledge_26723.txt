Use caching mechanisms, including browser cache and server Caching to reduce server response time and page load time 3. Reduce the number of HTTP requests, reduce HTTP requests for pages by merging files and minimizing resources, thereby speeding up page response time 4. Use content delivery network (CDN) to speed up the network Request and improve response speed 5. Optimize database query and indexing to improve database response speed 6.
