User: According to the following description, designing a MySQL-based parking lot management system The parking lot management system needs to have the following functions:\n1. Maintain vehicle information, including license plate number, model, owner information, etc.;\n2. Maintain parking space information, including parking spaces Number, parking space type (small parking space, large parking space, etc.), parking space status (free, occupied, etc.), etc.;\n3. Realize the management of vehicle entry and exit records, including vehicle entry time, departure time, residence time, etc.;\n4. Provide charge management functions, including charge standards, charge amount calculation, etc.;\n5. Provide data statistics functions, including statistical analysis of parking space occupancy rate, parking duration and other data.
Assistant: Table design: 1. Vehicle information table | field name | field type | description | | --- | --- | --- | | id | int | vehicle number | | plate_number | varchar(20) | type | varchar(20) | vehicle type | | owner | varchar(50) | owner information | 2. Parking space table | field name | field type | description | | --- | --- | --- | | id | int | parking space number | | type | varchar(20) | parking space type | | status | varchar(20) | parking space status (free, occupied, etc.) | | | --- | --- | --- | | id | int | entry and exit record number | | plate_number | varchar(20) | license plate number | | entry_time | | duration | int | stay time | 4. Charge standard table | field name | field type | description | | --- | --- | --- | | id | int | charge standard number | | type | varchar(20 ) | charging standard type | | price | decimal | charging amount | 5. Data statistics table | field name | field type | description | | --- | --- | date | date | statistical date | | occupancy_rate | decimal | parking occupancy rate | | average_duration | int | average parking duration | In the vehicle entry and exit record table, the entry_time and exit_time fields can be automatically generated by the program. The data in the statistical table can be automatically calculated by the program. It should be noted that the charging amount in the charging standard table can set different charging standards according to different types of parking spaces and length of stay. At the same time, foreign keys need to be added to the parking space table and the vehicle entry and exit record table to associate with the vehicle information table and the charging standard table to facilitate data management and query.
