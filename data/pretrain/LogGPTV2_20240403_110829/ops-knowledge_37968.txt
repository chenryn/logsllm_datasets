User: Please explain common Linux performance problems and their solutions.
Assistant: 1. High CPU load: When the system has a large number of processes or applications running at the same time, the CPU load may become too high. Workarounds include adding more CPUs or cores, spreading tasks, optimizing code, or upgrading hardware. 2. Insufficient disk space: When the disk space is insufficient, the system may become unstable or even stop working. Solutions include cleaning up unnecessary files, compressing and archiving files, upgrading disks or adding new storage services. 3. Insufficient memory: When system processes or applications require more memory than is available on the system, the system may become slow or unstable. Solutions include increasing physical or virtual memory, closing unnecessary applications, and adjusting memory usage by processes or applications. 4. Network bottleneck: When the throughput of a network connection exceeds the network bandwidth, data transmission may become slow or delayed. Workarounds include adjusting network bandwidth limits, using a higher speed network connection, or upgrading hardware. 5. System crash: The system may crash due to hardware failure or software bug. Workarounds include repairing or replacing damaged hardware, updating and fixing software bugs. 6. Application performance issues: When an application runs slowly or has errors on a Linux system, it may be necessary to tune the application or change the system configuration. Solutions include optimizing code, adjusting system parameters, or upgrading hardware.
