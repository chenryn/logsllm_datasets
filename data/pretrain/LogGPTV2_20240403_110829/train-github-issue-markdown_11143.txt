I would have expected this to work, but it does not:
    #[feature(macro_rules)];
    macro_rules! test {
        () => {
            fn foo();
        }
    }
    trait Foo {
        test!()
    }
Currently fails with this error:
    test.rs:10:4: 10:8 error: unexpected token: `test`
    test.rs:10     test!()
                   ^~~~
