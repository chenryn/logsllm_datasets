User: I have a few long term processes and temporary processes in Python. While shell and C programs run under their own names, all Python processes run as 'python filename.py', which makes it tough to identify processes. 
How can I make python processes show up as 'logserver.py' or such in Linux? I use Python 2.7 in Ubuntu 11.10.
Assistant: Add a shebang to the Python file in question, make the Python file executable (e.g. by chmod a+x ./logserver.py) and start it directly by ./logserver.py.
A shebang is a line telling the kernel which interpreter to use.  It's simply a line like #!/usr/bin/env python at the very beginning of the file.
