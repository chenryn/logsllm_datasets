User: I installed both Python 2.7 and Python 2.6.5. I don't know what went wrong, but nothing related to Python seems to work any more. e.g. "setup.py install" for certain packages don't recognize the "install" parameter and other odd phenomena...
I would like to completely remove Python from my system.
I tried running the 2.7 and 2.6 msi files and choosing remove Python and then running only 2.6 and reinstalling it. Still stuff don't work.
How do I completely remove Python - from everything? (!)
I would not like to reinstall my entire machine just because of the Python install...
Assistant: First, uninstall Python, then remove the pip packages you installed.

Uninstall Python: "Add or Remove Programs", search for Python and uninstall it.
Remove Pip packages: type in File Explorer %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python, and remove the folders you want.

This will clean up any pip package you installed. Otherwise, if you were to reinstall Python, you will find yourself with the same pip packages that you had.
