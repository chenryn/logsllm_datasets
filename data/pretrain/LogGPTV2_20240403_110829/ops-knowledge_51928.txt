User: I want to lock the file whenever I perform read/write operation on that file. No other program or function can access file until I do not release the file. How do you do this in Python?
Assistant: Google up zc.lockfile or portalocker.py. Both libraries can lock a file in a portable manner (windows and posix systems). I usually use zc.lockfile.
