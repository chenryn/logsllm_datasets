# atmadm: Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Call Manager Utility

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Overview:**
The `atmadm` utility is used to monitor connections and addresses registered by the ATM Call Manager on an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network. It can display statistics for incoming and outgoing calls on ATM adapters. When used without parameters, `atmadm` displays statistics for monitoring the status of active ATM connections.

## Syntax
```sh
atmadm [/c] [/a] [/s] [/?]
```

## Parameters
- **/c**: Displays call information for all current connections to the ATM network adapter installed on this computer.
- **/a**: Displays the registered ATM network service access point (NSAP) address for each adapter installed in this computer.
- **/s**: Displays statistics for monitoring the status of active ATM connections.
- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

### Explanation of `atmadm /c` Output
- **Connection Information**:
  - **In/Out**: Direction of the call. "In" indicates a call to the ATM network adapter from another device. "Out" indicates a call from the ATM network adapter to another device.
  - **PMP**: Point-to-multipoint call.
  - **P-P**: Point-to-point call.
  - **SVC**: Connection is on a switched virtual circuit.
  - **PVC**: Connection is on a permanent virtual circuit.
- **VPI/VCI Information**:
  - **VPI/VCI**: Virtual path and virtual channel of the incoming or outgoing call.
- **Remote Address/Media Parameters**:
  - **Remote Address**: NSAP address of the calling (In) or called (Out) ATM device.
  - **Tx**: Transmit parameters including bit-rate type (e.g., UBR, CBR, VBR, ABR), line speed, and specified service data unit (SDU) size.
  - **Rx**: Receive parameters including bit-rate type, line speed, and specified SDU size.
