The intestine is one of the key organs absorbing and metabolizing nutrients required for survival Clinical phenotypes like eg inflammatory bowel 
disease, result in disturbed nutrient uptake and several health issues in patients However, clinical tests used for monitoring intestinal functionality 
are either invasive, unspecific or unable to monitor the subtle changes During inflammatory process, arachidonic acid (AA) is released through 
phospholipase A-2 mediated hydrolysis of epithelial phospholipids and further metabolized to prostaglandins and other eicosanoids Therefore, we 
aim to establish a stable-isotope mediated metabolomics platform to monitor the function of intestine using stable isotope-labeled AA For proof-
of-concept purpose, we used Caco-2 cell model and induced its inflammatory response by interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ 
Furthermore, we feed Caco-2 cells with 13C-labeled AA and evaluate its incorporation into the phospholipids and its downstream metabolites To 
monitor the changes of phospholipids, we have established a shotgun lipidomics platform, using nano-electrospray coupled to a Q-Exactive HF 
orbitrap mass spectrometer To evaluate the release of eicosanoids, we used a targeted UPLC-MS/MS method (for 130 eicosanoids) on an API 6500 
QTRAP system Our first results confirmed uptake of C13-AA in the Caco-2 cells and release of prostaglandins into medium from cytokines-stimulated 
Caco-2 cells These will also be further optimized in view of dynamics of inflammatory processes and further applied in various in-vivo systems

Isotype-specific regulation of whole-body gluconeogenesis by AAK/AMPK in live C. elegans observed with real-time  
in-organism NMR metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Tin Nguyen, Seoul National University, South Korea

Traditional metabolomics employs sample extraction of tissues and cells, making it difficult to understand the actual metabolic flux in a living system 
at the whole-organism level Combining whole-body 13C-labeling strategy, NMR spectroscopy, and optimized sampling methods, we developed an 
in-organism NMR metabolomics approach for live C elegans animals The convenient approach allowed real-time monitoring of metabolic activity 
at the whole-body level of live worms with high sensitivity and resolution When applied to C elegans with mutations in AAK/AMPK, a metabolic 
master regulator, this approach revealed unique metabolic role of AAK-1 and AAK-2 isotypes in live C elegans Particularly, the aak-1 knockout 
animals exhibited enhanced glucose production under starvation, strikingly opposite to aak-2 knockout animals Unusually high compensatory 
expression of the reciprocal isotypes in each mutant and the results for the double knockout suggested an unconventional phenotype-genotype 
relationship and the epistasis of aak-2 to aak-1 in glucose production Mechanistically, the gene expression and 13C-isotope incorporation results 
showed that aak-1 KO metabotypes are due to reduced TCA and glycolysis and enhanced gluconeogenesis through the activation of fatty acid 
oxidation and glyoxylate shunt Revealing isotype-specific roles of the catalytic subunits of AAK/AMPK, our approach should be readily applicable to 
other metabolic models involving C elegans

Wikidata and Scholia as a hub linking metabolite knowledge
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Egon Willighagen, Maastricht University, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Denise Slenter, Daniel Mietchen, Chris T. Evelo, Finn Å. Nielsen
Making chemical databases more FAIR supports identification of unexpected chemical compounds (toxicants, drug metabolites, etc) in untargeted 
metabolomics experiments We here discuss Wikidata: it is a machine readable database, boosting the interoperability of metabolite databases 
Thanks to the Wikidata:WikiProject Chemistry community, there is a growing amount of information about metabolites: Wikidata currently has over 
150 thousand compounds with InChIKeys and 70 thousand CAS numbers Ongoing work by this WikiProject includes capturing chemical classes and 
chemical compounds in the various Wikipedias as machine readable data Other projects include covering human drugs [2], MeSH Chemicals and 
Drugs, and volatile organic compounds We here introduce our contributions to the WikiProject Chemistry to support FAIR-ification of metabolite 
knowledge For example, we proposed Wikidata properties to annotate compounds with database identifiers for the EPA CompTox Dashboard [2], 
the SPLASH [3], and MassBank Furthermore, we used a combination of Bioclipse and QuickStatements to add missing compounds for biological 
pathways from WikiPathways [4] Finally, we introduce an extension of Scholia [5], visualizing data about compounds and compound classes, 
including external identifiers, physicochemical properties, and an overview of the literature from which the knowledge is derived At the time of 
writing, three thousand chemicals are linked to more than 170 thousand research articles 2 Putman TE, et al Database 2017;2017(1) 3 Williams, AJ,

Optimisation of nanoelectrospray direct infusion mass spectrometry metabolomics for 96-well based in vitro, high throughput 
screening
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Julia Malinowska, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Julia M. Malinowska, Taina Palosaari, Jukka Sund, Donatella Carpi, Maurice Whelan, Mark R. Viant
High throughput screening (HTS) is becoming a recognised approach for supporting decision-making in chemical safety assessment, whilst in 
vitro metabolomics is a promising tool to accelerate a departure from the use of animal models in toxicity testing The objective of this study 
was to seek compatibility of high-resolution spectral-stitching nanoelectrospray direct infusion mass spectrometry (nanoDIMS) metabolomics 
(University of Birmingham) and an HTS platform (EU Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing) Low biomass cell samples (50,000 
hepatocytes of HepaRG per well) were prepared for metabolomics analyses using a newly established automated protocol and solvent system 
(Biomek FXp laboratory automated workstation) and analysed using a modified nanoDIMS method (Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Elite) suitable 
for small sample sizes The proposed method was assessed with respect to sensitivity and reproducibility of the entire workflow from HepaRG 
sampling to measurement of the metabolic phenotype It has been demonstrated that the optimised nanoDIMS metabolomics method provides 
acceptable sensitivity (>3,500 non-background peaks routinely detected) as well as acceptable intra- and inter-plate variability (median relative 
standard deviation <30%) in both polar and nonpolar nanoDIMS assays Baseline characterisation of HepaRG endogenous metabolism over time 
and a pilot study with a model toxicant (cadmium chloride) are underway, revealing changes in the metabolome through a 48-hr culture period This 
newly established analytical method shows that in vitro metabolomics may be readily applied as an additional high content assay in 96-well HTS, 
complementing HT measures of the transcriptome and image phenotype
