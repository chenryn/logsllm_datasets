### Description
How can I add multiple request body for same endpoint. I wanted to accept
application/json and application/pdf for same endpoint. Lets say i have
exposed http://localhost:5000/test which should accept application/json as
well as application/pdf. I wanted to write business logic based on request
body type.?
Is it possible to expose only one endpoint with multiple request body type
like application/json and application/pdf?
