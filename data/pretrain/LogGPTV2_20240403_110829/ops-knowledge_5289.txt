User:  Please introduce the application of virtualization technology in cloud computing, and list several common virtualization technologies.
Assistant: Virtualization technology plays a vital role in cloud computing. It can virtualize computing resources, storage resources and network resources, so as to achieve elastic allocation and dynamic management of resources. Virtualization technology has the following applications: 1. Server virtualization: Physical servers can be virtualized, and multiple virtual machines can run on the same physical server, thereby improving server utilization and saving costs. 2. Storage virtualization: multiple storage devices can be virtualized and aggregated into a logical storage pool to achieve flexible allocation and dynamic management of storage resources. 3. Network virtualization: The physical network can be virtualized, multiple virtual networks can be isolated in the same physical network, and the dynamic allocation and flexible management of network resources can be realized. Common virtualization technologies include: 1. Operating system virtualization: such as VMware, VirtualBox, etc., which can virtualize multiple operating systems on the same physical server and isolate them. 2. Container virtualization: such as Docker, Kubernetes, etc., can package applications and their dependencies into containers, so as to run multiple containers on the same physical server and isolate them. 3. Hardware virtualization: such as Intel VT, AMD-V, etc., can run multiple virtual machines on the same physical server and isolate them to achieve isolation protection of virtual machines and improve performance.
