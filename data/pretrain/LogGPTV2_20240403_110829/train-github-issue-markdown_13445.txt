 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
If a exception raise in commit() function, rollback() function would be called
and then the exception would be re-raised. The re-raising of the exception may
be failed when sqlalchemy work with a coroutine framework such as evenlet or
gevent due to a context switch(rollback is a bocking function, which will
cause a context switch, and the exception may be cleared within the context
switch). The issue could be simplely fixed by the following patch without
risk.
