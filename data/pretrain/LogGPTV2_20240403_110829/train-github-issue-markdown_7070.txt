Some gaps here:
  * `flutter create -t plugin` does not produce any test files.
  * https://flutter.io/platform-channels/ does not mention testing.
Actions items:
  * Write a best practices doc for testing plugins. Mention both Dart and native code. Publicize the mock channel implementation (I personally learned about this by reading code in flutter/plugins).
  * Add test files to the template.
