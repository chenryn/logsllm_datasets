### Build Log and Error Analysis

#### Summary
The build process for PyTorch on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2 is failing due to the absence of required libraries, particularly Intel MKL, and the incompatibility of some components with the 32-bit ARM architecture. The build script attempts to find and link various libraries, but none are found, leading to the use of alternative libraries like Eigen. Additionally, the build fails when it encounters the MKL-DNN library, which only supports 64-bit platforms.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Library Checks:**
   - The build script checks for multiple combinations of Intel MKL libraries (e.g., `mkl_intel`, `mkl_gf`, etc.) but none are found.
   - It then defaults to using the Eigen library as a fallback.
   - The script also checks for other BLAS and LAPACK implementations like Accelerate, vecLib, and OpenBLAS. Only OpenBLAS is found and used.
   - MKL-DNN is not supported on 32-bit platforms, leading to a CMake error.

2. **CMake Configuration:**
   - CMake version: 3.13.4
   - System: Linux (Raspbian GNU/Linux 10)
   - C++ compiler: `/usr/bin/c++` (version 8.3.0)
   - Build type: Release
   - ONNX version: 1.5.0
   - Python interpreter: `/usr/bin/python3` (version 3.7.3)

3. **Build Flags and Features:**
   - OpenMP support is enabled.
   - CUDA, CuDNN, ROCM, and MIOpen are disabled due to the absence of these libraries or the 32-bit architecture.
   - NNPACK backend is set to NEON, which is appropriate for the ARM architecture.

4. **Errors:**
   - The primary error is that MKL-DNN only supports 64-bit platforms, and the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2 is a 32-bit system.
   - Other errors include the inability to find specific libraries, leading to the use of fallbacks.

#### Suggested Actions

1. **Disable Unsupported Features:**
   - Since MKL-DNN is not supported on 32-bit systems, you should disable it explicitly in your build command:
     ```bash
     sudo USE_MKLDNN=0 USE_QNNPACK=0 USE_NNPACK=0 USE_DISTRIBUTED=0 python3 setup.py build
     ```

2. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure that the environment variables `USE_MKLDNN`, `USE_QNNPACK`, `USE_NNPACK`, and `USE_DISTRIBUTED` are correctly set to `0` before running the build command.
   - You can print the values of these variables to verify:
     ```bash
     echo $USE_MKLDNN
     echo $USE_QNNPACK
     echo $USE_NNPACK
     echo $USE_DISTRIBUTED
     ```

3. **Use Pre-built Binaries:**
   - Consider using pre-built binaries for PyTorch if available for your platform. This can save time and avoid build issues.

4. **Update and Rebuild:**
   - Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and correctly installed.
   - Re-run the build process after making the necessary changes.

#### Example Command
```bash
sudo USE_MKLDNN=0 USE_QNNPACK=0 USE_NNPACK=0 USE_DISTRIBUTED=0 python3 setup.py build
```
