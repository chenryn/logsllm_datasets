User: Currently running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 , and it has python2.7 as default. In the terminal, i type 'python' and it automatically pulls up python2.7. I don't want that. 
from terminal I have to instead type 'python3.2' if i want to use python3.2. 
How do i change that?
Assistant: If you have python 2 and 3 on brew. Following worked for me.
brew unlink python@2
brew link python@3  (if not yet linked)
