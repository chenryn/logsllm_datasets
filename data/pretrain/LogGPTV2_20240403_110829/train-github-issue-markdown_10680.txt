I have been working on Deno compatibility for the TypeScript data validation
library "Zod" (colinhacks/zod#269). The `v3` development branch is working
properly under `deno run`, but I am still encountering some errors in the
output of `deno bundle`.
I am testing with the latest canary build representing the current `master`,
36ff7bd (`deno 1.6.3+36ff7bd (canary, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)`). #9085/swc-
project/swc#1318 resolved the error I was previously encountering in #9085,
but I am encountering new ones.
when I run `deno bundle
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colinhacks/zod/654680afc2ede388e71e09104eac5a0088fe3207/deno/lib/index.ts
&& deno run bundle.js`, an error is thrown while evaluating the bundled
module:
    error: Uncaught ReferenceError: util is not defined
    const ZodIssueCode = util.arrayToEnum([
                         ^
        at file:///mnt/c/Users/_/src/bundle.js:1:22
When we look at the bundle output, we can indeed see that the contents of the
`"./helpers/util.ts";` import are not present in the bundled output.
When we don't go through the bundler, but instead just use `deno run
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colinhacks/zod/654680afc2ede388e71e09104eac5a0088fe3207/deno/lib/index.ts`
directly, the library is imported and evaluated without any errors.
I experienced the same result (`run` successful, `bundle`-and-`run` missing
modules) when I tried bundling a real project of mine that was using Zod and
Deno, instead of the above example.
