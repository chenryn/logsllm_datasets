### Bug report
Normally, systemwide configuration files at not completely ignored just
because a local/user configuration file exists. But MPL will ignore default
configuration values in /etc/matplotlibrc if a user matplotlibrc is found.
The documentation states that user configuration files are searched first,
which, if you think about it, only makes sense if the configuration files are
all _mutually exclusive_. But, this is not stated or acknowledged in the
documentation, elsewhere. Since mutual exclusivity is abnormal behavior for
configuration files, can you please, at least, make this more clear in the
documentation?
Is it possible to implement more conventional behavior where the system-wide
defaults are always read, if they exist, and the user-specific or local
configurations override them?
