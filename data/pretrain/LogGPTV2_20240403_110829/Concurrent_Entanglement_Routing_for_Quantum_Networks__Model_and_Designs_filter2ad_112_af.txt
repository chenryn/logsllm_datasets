A.1 Finding the optimal path selection for
Q-CAST
Figure 27: Counterexample for two possible algorithms
We summarize the hardness of the contention-free path selection
problem without classifying it into a certain complexity class, and
show its hardness in three examples. On one hand, because of
the resource constraints (qubits/channels), path selection depends
highly on the link states and hence the search space is much more
than the classical algorithms which only depends on the weighted
graph while edges and nodes have unlimited capacity; on the other
hand, Et is non-linear, which invalids many existing proofs based
on the linear additivity of the routing metric and thus degrades the
efficiency of classical algorithms.
Example 1. Despite its good performance (shown in ğ 5), we
prove G-EDA is not the optimal. An example graph is shown in
Fig. 27 3. Suppose all the edges have width 3, all channels have
creation rate p = 0.99, the swapping success rate q = 1, s and d
have qubit capacity 6, and all other nodes have capacity 3. Then
the optimal contention-free paths are the blue path plus the green
path. But the G-EDA will output only the red path. The reason of
the failure of G-EDA is it falls in a local minimum and fails to give
the max-flow ś the width of the red path is 3, as opposed to 6 for
the blue path plus the green path.
Example 2. Though the classical max-flow algorithm gives the
optimal solution, it performs worse than G-EDA in some other cases.
Consider the same topology in Fig. 27 with changed parameters.
Suppose all blue and green edges have width 1, red edges have width
2, all channels have creation rate p = 0.6, the swapping success
3Red path: (s , A, B , d). Green path: (s , C , A, E , d). Blue path: (s , D , B , F , d).
rate q = 1, s and d have qubit capacity 3, and all other nodes have
capacity 2. From Fig. 6, we know when p = 0.6, one (2, 3)-path is
better than three (1, 4)-paths. Hence, the optimal solution is the red
path with W = 2, which can be found via G-EDA. The max-flow
algorithm, however, gives the green path, the blue path, and the
red path ś all paths are single ś which is the sub-optimal solution.
Example 3. Due to the enormous search space, we failed to find
the optimal strategy via brute-force even in a 10-node network. Sup-
pose |V | = 10, every node has 15 qubits and 6 edges, and each edge
is composed of 5 quantum channels. In the brute-force searching,
we do not assume the P2 and P4 are carried out based on ‘paths’,
but just try all possible assignments of qubits to channels, perform
the swapping, calculate the Et between the given S-D pair, and
record the highest result. For any S-D pair, the search space for
P2 is ∼ 2.3 · 10364. Even worse, the entanglement swapping in P4
depends on local states, which is prohibitively hard to enumerate
all possible swapping combinations.
A.2 Time and space cost analysis
To avoid unbound computation and space cost in P2, we set the
maximum number of multipath Km = 200. We set the maximum
path hopcount according to the network itself. For any input G,
100 S-D pairs are randomly selected, and then multipath routing is
performed via G-EDA between each S-D pair. The largest hopcount
of selected paths whose Et > 1 is the maximum hopcount hm of all
selected paths. We denote the number of nodes as n, the number of
S-D pairs as m, and the maximum width of paths as Wm , which is
determined by node capacities and edge widths.

A.2.1 Cost of routing metric evaluation. The calculation of Et can
be performed by following the recursive formula set 1. For an h-hop
path with width W , the calculation of Et goes as following. Iterate
on k, from 1 to h and further iterate on i, from W to 1: calculate
Qi
. Five W -element arrays
k
are allocated to store the values. After that, Et = qh · W
is
calculated in W + h time. Hence, the time cost is O(hW ), and the
space cost is O(W ).
A.2.2 Cost of P2 algorithm of Q-PASS. The initialization costs O(n)
time. The double-for loop costs O(mKm(hm + hm + log(mKm)))
time. The while loop costs O(mKm(hm + log(mKm) + hm)) time.
Hence, the overall time cost is
O(mKm(hm + log(mKm))).
Each of the LC , LP , and q costs O(mKmhm) space, the TQ costs
O(n) space, the width costs O(mKm) space. Hence, the overall space
cost is O(mKmhm + n).
A.2.3 Cost of EDA. For a classical network ⟨V , E⟩, the Dijkstra’s
algorithm costs O(n log n +|E|) time because the dequeue operation
costs O(log n) time, the reorder operation of the Fibonacci heap
costs O(1) time, and each edge is visited at most once. Similarly, the
time cost for EDA is O(n log n +hmWm +|E|(hmWm)) = O(n log n +
|E|(hmWm)). The space cost is O(n).
4This number is got via a recursive algorithm instead of mathematical derivation.
Consider the number of unique combinations of 15 indistinguishable balls put into 6
different buckets, each with capacity 5.
