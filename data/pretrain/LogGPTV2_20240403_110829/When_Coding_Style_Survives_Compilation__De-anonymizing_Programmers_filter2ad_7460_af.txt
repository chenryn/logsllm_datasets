### Validation and Utility of the GCJ Dataset for Authorship Attribution

The GCJ (Google Code Jam) dataset is a robust and valuable proxy for real-world authorship attribution tasks, as supported by various sources. Its utility in scientific analysis of attribution tasks is further enhanced by its controlled environment, where the primary distinguishing factor between programmers' solutions is their unique programming style. In the GCJ competition, all contestants are required to implement the same functionality within a limited time, with the difficulty of problems increasing progressively. This setup allows for precise control over the complexity of the samples and the skill levels of the programmers, which is crucial for accurate authorship attribution.

### Advantages of the GCJ Dataset

One of the key advantages of using the GCJ dataset is the consistency in the tasks assigned to programmers. This consistency ensures that the differences in the code are primarily due to the individual's coding style rather than the problem's inherent complexity. Research has shown that programmers who can implement more sophisticated functionality tend to have more distinct programming styles [16]. This pattern is also observed in executable binary samples, providing valuable insights into the stylistic properties of compiled code.

In contrast, datasets from platforms like GitHub and Nulled.IO often contain noisy samples, making them less ideal for controlled experiments. However, our results demonstrate that high-accuracy de-anonymization is achievable with sufficient training data, even in the presence of noise.

### Preservation of Coding Style in Compiled Code

Previous studies have established that coding style is prevalent in source code. Surprisingly, we found that this style is also preserved to a significant degree in compiled code. Coding style is not merely about syntactical constructs but also includes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) flows, AST combinations, and preferred types of operations. These patterns manifest in the binary, forming a unique coding fingerprint for each author.

Our experiments show that even after applying basic obfuscation, optimization, or symbol stripping, stylistic features remain largely intact. While these methods transform the binaries, they are not sufficient to completely protect programmers from de-anonymization attacks.

### Challenges and Solutions in Authorship Attribution

In scenarios where direct top-1 classification is challenging, an analyst or adversary can use relaxed attribution to identify a set of n potential authors. For example, in top-10 attribution, the likelihood of including the original author in the returned set approaches 100%. Once the suspect set is reduced, dynamic approaches and reverse engineering can be used to pinpoint the author. Our current experiments rely on information-gain features determined from unoptimized cases with symbol tables intact. Future work could customize the dimensionality reduction step for optimized and obfuscated cases, potentially improving the accuracy further.

### Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction

Despite the cryptic nature of executable binaries, we can extract numerous useful features from disassembly, control flow graphs, and decompiled code. After dimensionality reduction, we find that each feature space provides valuable information about programming style. Initially, we extracted 705,000 features from 900 executable binary samples of 100 authors. We discovered that approximately 50 features from abstract syntax trees and assembly instructions are sufficient to capture key coding style information, enabling robust authorship attribution.

Our method can de-anonymize 100 programmers with 96% accuracy and 600 programmers with 83% accuracy using the same reduced feature set. This is a significant achievement, especially considering the random chance of correctly identifying an author is only 0.17%.

### Limitations and Future Work

While our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, there are several assumptions and limitations to consider:

1. **Ground Truth Assumption**: We assume that the ground truth is correct, but in reality, programs in GCJ or on GitHub might be written by different or multiple programmers. This can lead to noisy models and lower de-anonymization accuracy.
2. **Compilation Issues**: Many GCJ source code samples cannot be compiled, limiting the number of executable binary samples available for evaluation. This is not a limitation for an attacker who has access to the binary but does affect our experimental setup.
3. **Compiler and Binary Format**: Our focus is on C/C++ code compiled with GCC and assumes the ELF (Executable and Linking Format) binary format. Other compilers, languages, and binary formats may require different approaches, which we plan to investigate in future work.
4. **Obfuscation and Anti-Forensic Techniques**: While our method can handle simple obfuscation techniques, it does not address heavily obfuscated binaries designed to hinder reverse engineering. Future work will explore the impact of advanced obfuscation and anti-forensic techniques on authorship attribution.

### Privacy Implications and Countermeasures

De-anonymizing programmers has significant implications for privacy and anonymity. The ability to attribute authorship to anonymous executable binaries is a concern for those who wish to remain anonymous. Our findings suggest that coding style is preserved through compilation, contrary to the belief that compilation erases stylistic properties.

To mitigate these risks, developers can employ countermeasures such as randomized coding styles, using different programming languages, and employing a combination of obfuscation methods. However, incorporating these measures is not always practical, especially in open-source software. Future research will focus on completely stripping stylistic information from binaries to ensure anonymity.

### Conclusion

Our experiments demonstrate that our method can de-anonymize a large set of programmers with high accuracy, even in challenging real-world scenarios. We have identified a small set of features that effectively represent coding style in executable binaries, obtained through disassemblers, control flow graphs, and decompilation. While our work significantly advances programmer de-anonymization, it also highlights the need for robust countermeasures to protect privacy.
