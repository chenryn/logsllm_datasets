**Title: Zen and the Art of Network Architecture**

**Author: Larry Peterson, Princeton University**

**Abstract:**

Network architectures represent a unique intersection of technical and non-technical influences in the field of computer science. When carefully designed, they establish stable foundations that drive innovation. However, over time, these architectures succumb to entropy and require reinvention. Drawing from my extensive experience in building and managing network research testbeds, designing and deploying experimental network services, and observing significant shifts in the networking industry, this talk delves into the nature of network architectures. It also aims to distill a set of general principles and apply them to the emerging cloud landscape.
