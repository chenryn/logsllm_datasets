Zen and the Art of Network Architecture

ABSTRACT 
Network architectures are a unique artifact of computer science. 
They  are  shaped  by  both  technical  and  non-technical  forces. 
When  well-crafted,  they  define  fixed  points 
that  catalyze 
innovation. And they ultimately suffer from entropy and need to 
be reinvented. Drawing on my experiences building and operating 
network research testbeds, designing and deploying experimental 
network  services, 
the 
commercial  sector,  and  witnessing  fundamental  shifts  in  the 
networking  industry,  this  talk  explores  the  nature  of  network 
architectures. It also attempts to extract a set of general lessons, 
and apply them to the emerging cloud.
