User: I have a Jenkins job which executes a Python script (checkoutDevice.py) via shell. 
In checkoutDevice script, it connects to a inventory server and check out an available unit, unit's MAC address is available to return to Jenkins job 
I would like to return unit's MAC address from Python script to Jenkins job, so Jenkins job can pass that MAC address to another Python script.

a. How would I store unit's MAC address to Jenkins' environment variable so I can pass it to another Python script in the same job?
b. Another solution I am looking at is to write MAC address to a text file during execution of checkoutDevice script, then Jenkins will read that MAC address from the text file to store into a variable then pass to another Python script?
Assistant: There's no easy way I know of to store the "variable" in jenkins.  Your best bet is to use some other place to store this MAC address.  A file would be a good place, but it probably needs to be on a shared fileserver somewhere.
