Abstract. Certiﬁcateless cryptography achieves the best of the two
worlds: it inherits from identity-based techniques a solution to the cer-
tiﬁcate management problem in public-key encryption, whilst removing
the secret key escrow functionality inherent to the identity-based set-
ting. Signcryption schemes achieve conﬁdentiality and authentication si-
multaneously by combining public-key encryption and digital signatures,
oﬀering better overall performance and security. In this paper, we intro-
duce the notion of certiﬁcateless signcryption and present an eﬃcient
construction which guarantees security under insider attacks, and there-
fore provides forward secrecy and non-repudiation. The scheme is shown
to be secure using random oracles under a variant of the bilinear Diﬃe-
Hellman assumption.

Introduction
Certiﬁcateless cryptography achieves the best of two worlds. It inherits from
identity-based techniques a solution to the certiﬁcate management problem in
public-key encryption, yet it eliminates the need for a trusted authority with key
escrow capabilities.
In identity-based cryptography [18] an arbitrary bit-string representing a
user’s identity can be used as the encryption or veriﬁcation public key. This
means that public key certiﬁcates are not required. This feature, however, comes
at the cost of introducing an all-powerful secret key issuing authority, which au-
thenticates users and provides secret keys through a secure channel. The problem
is that, not only must this authority be trusted to authenticate the users, but
also not to take advantage of possessing the user’s secret keys. This is known as
the key escrow property of identity-based cryptosystems and it can be presented
as a feature or a security problem, depending on the application scenario.
In certiﬁcateless cryptography key escrow is seen as an undesirable property,
and user encryption and veriﬁcation keys contain both a user identity and an
unauthenticated public key. Similarly, user secret keys are constructed from two
partial secrets: one coming from an identity-based trusted authority called the
Key Generation Centre (KGC) and another one generated by the user. Certiﬁ-
cateless security models capture scenarios where the attacker can be a system
user or the KGC itself. To account for the fact that user public keys are not
authenticated, attackers are allowed to replace users’ public keys to attempt
impersonation.
Since certiﬁcateless cryptography was introduced by Al-Ryiami and Pater-
son [1], numerous certiﬁcateless encryption and signature schemes, and variants
thereof, have been proposed. However, the equivalent of public-key signcryption
has not been considered in the certiﬁcateless setting.
Signcryption is a cryptographic primitive that captures a common practical
scenario where one simultaneously requires conﬁdentiality and non-repudiation
of transmitted data. Ideally, this should allow for improvements in the overall
security and eﬃciency of the resulting cryptosystems. The security goals as-
sociated with signcryption are stronger than those provided by authenticated
encryption, where data authenticity suﬃces. For this reason the security model
for signcryption should capture insider attacks where a dishonest receiver, should
not be able to forge a valid signcryption originating from another user. In less
common scenarios one may also require forward secrecy, where a message sent
by a legitimate user, cannot be decrypted even by an adversary which later is
able to get hold of the sender’s secret key. This primitive has been extensively
studied in the public-key and identity-based settings where many eﬃcient and
secure schemes have been proposed.
Our Contribution: In this paper we introduce the notion of certiﬁcateless
signcryption, deﬁne appropriate security models, and propose an eﬃcient scheme
which is provably secure against insider attacks in the random oracle model
[4]. The scheme presents stronger security properties than one might expect
from its internal building blocks: by sharing randomness between encryption
and signature modules not only we gain extra savings on computational and
bandwidth load, but also we obtain strong insider security guarantees. As an
additional contribution, we identify a problem in using Coron’s technique for
tighter security reductions in public key signature proofs which is speciﬁc to the
certiﬁcateless setting and propose a technique to overcome it.
Paper Organisation: Section 2 describes related work available in the litera-
ture. In Section 3 we revise some background on bilinear groups, pairings and
associated hard problems. Then, in Section 4 we introduce certiﬁcateless sign-
cryption and deﬁne suitable security models for this primitive. In Section 5 we
propose an eﬃcient scheme and provide a security argument for it. Finally, in
Section 6 we discuss the relevance and implications of our results.

2 Related Work
Signcryption in the public-key setting was introduced by Zheng in [20]. A sys-
tematic study of the properties of the signcryption schemes resulting from the
black-box composition of encryption and signature schemes was later presented
by An et al. [2]. Our certiﬁcateless signcryption scheme is based on the Encrypt-
then-Sign paradigm discussed in [2]. More eﬃcient generic constructions of sign-
cryption schemes based on Tag-KEMs were introduced by Bjørstad et al. [5].
Malone-Lee in [17] formulated signcryption in the identity-based setting. This
work was extended by Boyen [6] who proposed a more structured primitive
deﬁnition and comprehensive security notions which captured diﬀerent security
guarantees that could be achieved by an identity-based signcryption scheme.
Other eﬃcient constructions were subsequently proposed by Libert et al. in [14]
and Chen et al. in [7].
Together with the introduction of certiﬁcateless cryptography in [1], Al-
Ryiami and Paterson proposed an encryption scheme and brieﬂy outlined a
signature scheme and extensions of other public-key primitives to the certiﬁ-
cateless scenario. The encryption scheme was proven secure under a non-realistic
security model where an adversary may replace users’ public keys and demand
decryptions without providing the corresponding secret key. In [15], Libert et al.
generalised the encryption scheme in [1] by proposing a generic construction of
certiﬁcateless encryption schemes from identity-based and public-key encryption
in the random oracle model. Recently, Dent et al. [11] have proposed certiﬁ-
cateless encryption schemes which provide the same security guarantees in the
standard model. A good survey of certiﬁcateless public-key encryption schemes
and security models can be found in [10].
The certiﬁcateless signature scheme proposed in [1], which lacked a security
proof, was later found to be vulnerable to key replacement attacks [13]. Other
certiﬁcateless signature schemes have been proposed in recent years. We refer to
the work of Zhang et al. [19], which proposes a certiﬁcateless signature scheme
closely based on the identity-based signature scheme of Libert et al. in [16].
We base our certiﬁcateless signcryption construction on this signature scheme,
but it is worthwhile to mention that the proof of security presented in [19]
for this scheme is ﬂawed. Despite this, the scheme is secure, but in a slightly
weaker security model later proposed informally in [12] together with a generic
construction for certiﬁcateless signatures. We will discuss this issue further in
Section 6.
To the best of our knowledge, the concept of certiﬁcateless signcryption has
not been previously addressed in literature. However, a closely related construc-
tion, which oﬀers authenticated certiﬁcateless encryption functionality was pro-
posed in [8]3. The diﬀerence between authenticated encryption and signcryption
is a subtle but signiﬁcant one: insider attacks are not considered in the unforge-

and Lee has appeared on IACR ePrint archive in 2004. However, the security models
in this scheme do not capture the certiﬁcateless setting.

ability game, which means that non-repudiation is not guaranteed. The security
models adopted in [8] are signiﬁcantly weaker than the ones considered in this
paper, as they do not consider decryption on replaced public keys and impose
unreasonable restrictions on the adversary’s adaptive behaviour. In particular
the forward-secrecy argument presented for the scheme in [8] considers only
chosen-plaintext attacks. We base our signcryption scheme on this certiﬁcateless
encryption scheme, but our Encrypt-then-Sign construction with randomness
reuse permits obtaining improved security properties.
3 Bilinear Groups
Our scheme relies on bilinear groups and we brieﬂy recall their deﬁnition below.
∼= G2 and we may
We restrict our attention to the symmetric case where G1
consider a common generator P for them.
Deﬁnition 1. A bilinear group description Γ is a tuple (p, G1, G2, GT , e,P1,P2)
where:
– G1, G2 and GT are groups of order p with eﬃciently computable group laws.
– e : G1 × G2 → GT is an eﬃciently computable non-degenerate bilinear map.
– P1 and P2 are generators of G1 and G2 respectively.
In practice G1 and G2 will be related to the (additive) group of points on an
elliptic curve and GT will be a subgroup of the (multiplicative) group of a ﬁnite
ﬁeld. Hence, we use additive notation for G1 and G2 and multiplicative notation
for GT .
Not only do we wish the discrete logarithm problem in the three groups to
be intractable, but we also require the following problem to be hard too.
Deﬁnition 2. Given a bilinear group description Γ , we say the gap bilinear
Diﬃe-Hellman (GBDH) assumption holds if the advantage of any probabilistic
polynomial time adversary as deﬁned below is negligible.
Γ
(A, qDBDH) := Pr[T = e(P, P )abc|a, b, c ← Zp; T ← AOΓ (Γ, aP, bP, cP )].
AdvGBDH
Here OΓ denotes a decision bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman oracle which on input a four-
tuple (aP, bP, cP, T ) outputs 1 if T = e(P, P )abc and 0 otherwise. By qDBDH we
denote the maximum number of queries that A asks its decision oracle.
The following weaker assumption is implied by the above.
Deﬁnition 3. Given a bilinear group description Γ , we say the computational
Diﬃe-Hellman assumption in the presence of a decision bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman
oracle (GDH(cid:48)) holds in G1 if the advantage of any PPT adversary as deﬁned
below is negligible.
(cid:48)
AdvGDH
Γ (A, qDBDH) := Pr[Q = abP|a, b ← Zp; Q ← AOΓ (Γ, aP, bP )].
Here OΓ and qDBDH are as in the above deﬁnition.

This assumption in turn implies:
Deﬁnition 4. Given a bilinear group description Γ , we say the computational
Diﬃe-Hellman (CDH) assumption holds in G1 if the advantage of any PPT
adversary as deﬁned below is negligible.
AdvCDH
Γ (A) := Pr[Q = abP|a, b ← Zp; Q ← A(Γ, aP, bP )].
4 Certiﬁcateless Signcryption
A certiﬁcateless signcryption scheme is deﬁned by a six-tuple of probabilistic
polynomial-time algorithms. Four of these algorithms, the ones corresponding
to key management operations, are identical to those deﬁned for certiﬁcateless
encryption:
1. Setup(1κ). This is a global set-up algorithm, which takes as input the secu-
rity parameter 1κ and returns the KGC’s secret key Msk and global param-
eters params including a master public key Mpk and descriptions of message
space MCLSC(params), ciphertext space CCLSC(params) and randomness space
RCLSC(params). This algorithm is executed by the KGC, which publishes
params.
2. Extract-Partial-Private-Key(ID, Msk, params). An algorithm which takes
as input Msk, params and an identiﬁer string ID ∈ {0, 1}∗ representing a
user’s identity, and returns a partial secret key D. This algorithm is run by
the KGC, after verifying the user’s identity.
3. Generate-User-Keys(ID, params) An algorithm which takes an identity and
the public parameters and outputs a secret value x and a public key PK.
This algorithm is run by a user to obtain a public key and a secret value
which can be used to construct a full private key. The public key is published
without certiﬁcation.
4. Set-Private-Key(D, x, params). A deterministic algorithm which takes as
input a partial secret key D and a secret value x and returns the full private
key S. Again, this algorithm is run by a user to construct the full private
key.
The signcryption and de-signcryption algorithms are as follows:
5. Sc(m, SS, IDS, PKS, IDR, PKR, params; r). This is the signcryption algorithm.
On input of a message m ∈ MCLSC(params), sender’s full private key SS,
identity IDS and public key PKS, the receiver’s identity IDR and public
key PKR, the global parameters params and possibly some randomness r ∈
RCLSC(params), this algorithm outputs a ciphertext c ∈ CCLSC(params) or an
error symbol ⊥.
6. Dsc(c, SR, IDR, PKR, IDS, PKS, params). The deterministic de-signcryption al-
gorithm. On input of a ciphertext c, receiver’s full private key RS, identity
IDR and public key PKR, the sender’s identity IDS and public key PKS and the
global parameters params, this algorithm outputs a plaintext m or a failure
symbol ⊥.

Note that, as for identity-based signcryption, and unlike standard public-key
signcryption, certiﬁcateless signcryption is intrinsically multi-user: there is no
distinction between the simpler one-to-one scenario and a full-ﬂedged multi-user
scenario, as user’s identities are explicitly associated with ciphertexts.
In deﬁning the security of certiﬁcateless signcryption we follow the common
approach in literature [7, 6] where one does not consider attacks targeting sign-
cryptions where the sender and receiver identities are the same. In particular we
disallow such queries to relevant oracles and do not accept this type of signcryp-
tion as a valid forgery. We discuss this issue further in Section 6.
The security game that captures the conﬁdentiality requirement is based on
the concept of ciphertext indistinguishability, and is deﬁned as follows:
