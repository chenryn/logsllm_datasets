Electron is crashing while running a build in TravisCI. I setup my own crash
reporter server to capture the `upload_file_minidump` file and the other
values.
The text values are:
    {
      "pid": "2190",
      "ptime": "8282",
      "lsb-release": "Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS",
      "prod": "Electron",
      "ver": "0.36.0",
      "_companyName": "Cypress",
      "_productName": "Chromium",
      "_version": "0.2.0",
      "platform": "linux",
      "process_type": "browser"
    }
The actual `minidump` from the crash is here. Is this crash file helpful?
I've tested Electron in my own `Linux 12.04 Server`, `OSX,` and even
`CircleCI`, and it does **not** crash. So it must be something particular to
`TravisCI`. It is crashing consistently every single time in the exact same
area.
I'm going to do more research on the actual cause of the crash to help
determine the root cause - such as a specific action happening on the page.
I'll update the issue when I find out more.
