4.5 Case study: Blue Coat in UAE
Challenge 3: URL ﬁltering and network manage-
ment tools used in combination. Some of the products
we consider in this study can be used in tandem to achieve
the goals of an ISP. For example, software products such as
SmartFilter can be conﬁgured to run on proxy appliances,
such as Blue Coat’s ProxySG. We observe this situation in
Etisalat in the UAE, where we conﬁrm that the ISP is us-
ing SmartFilter for URL ﬁltering (§4.3). However, we also
identiﬁed installations of Blue Coat products in Etisalat us-
ing our methodology in Section 3. We created a set of test
URLs and submitted them to the “Proxy avoidance” cat-
egory for ﬁltering by Blue Coat (since we had previously
observed proxies blocked using SmartFilter). Upon testing
these URLs in Etisalat, we found that none of them were
blocked. While it may be the case that the network is us-
ing the two vendors to block diﬀerent types of content, the
more likely cause of this discrepancy is Etisalat using Smart-
Filter for URL ﬁltering atop a Blue Coat proxy which can
provide further traﬃc management capabilities (e.g., policy
enforcement, traﬃc shaping).
4.6 Ethical considerations
The case studies in the prior sections raise ethical issues
concerning use of the interfaces provided by the vendors to
submit Web sites. We emphasize that our approach does
not harm the intended performance of the URL ﬁlter as we
do not impact the classiﬁcation of legitimate Web sites. Fur-
ther, since the Web sites we submit are under our control,
there is no collateral damage to existing sites. Finally, in the
use of a pornographic image in Saudi Arabia we took care
to remove the image promptly after our tests were done. To
limit the testers’ exposure to the pornographic content, we
had them access a benign image ﬁle located on the host,
rather than the page containing the oﬀensive content. Since
our tests indicate that even the benign content on the host
was blocked, we conclude that blocking was at the granu-
larity of hostname, thus this method of mitigating user risk
does not impact the results.
5. CHARACTERIZING CENSORED CON-
TENT
Now that we have designed a methodology to identify and
conﬁrm the usage of URL ﬁlters, we consider the type of
content these products are blocking. The types of content
found blocked by URL ﬁlters was determined by querying
lists of URLs through the measurement client ( §4.1). Two
lists of URLs were tested in each country; a “global list”
of internationally relevant content which is constant for all
countries, and a “local list” of locally relevant content which
is designed for each country by regional experts and is unique
for each country tested. Each of the URLs on these lists was
assigned to one of 40 content categories (e.g. “human rights”
or “gambling”) under four general themes: political, social,
Internet tools and conﬂict/security content.
Tests using the measurement client to characterize the
type of content censored by URL ﬁltering products were
performed within 30 days of the conﬁrmations in Section 4.
Manual analysis identiﬁed regular expressions corresponding
to the vendors’ block pages and automated analysis iden-
tiﬁed all URLs which matched a given block page regular
expression.
Results of these tests, presented in Table 4, show that
all products are used to block a wide variety of content,
including oppositional and critical political content, non-
pornographic gay and lesbian content, human rights con-
tent, independent media, as well as content relating to mi-
nority groups and religious discussion. The blocking of such
content contradicts internationally recognized human rights
frameworks protecting freedom of expression, such as Article
19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [33].

6. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we present an initial methodology for iden-
tifying and conﬁrming the use of URL ﬁltering products
around the world and highlight challenges faced when ap-
plying this methodology. We now elaborate on how our
techniques would fare in the face of vendors that attempt to
mask the use of their products. Table 5 summarizes these
limitations. We emphasize that the identiﬁcation of prod-
ucts and conﬁrmation that they are used for censorship are
independent; thus the conﬁrmation (§4) is robust even if the
techniques presented in Section 3 are evaded.
6.1 Identifying and validating installations.
While our identiﬁcation method serves as a useful ﬁlter
when determining where to apply the techniques of Sec-
tion 4, we observe that URL ﬁlter vendors can take simple
steps to evade discovery. To prevent identiﬁcation of their
products, vendors could provide ISPs with scripts and con-
ﬁguration instructions that prevent the product from being
visible on the global Internet, however they are still reliant
on the ISP to implement this correctly. URL vendors may
also take steps to remove evidence of their products from
protocol headers which is fairly simple to do, but would re-
quire having all ISPs running the product perform a software
update before the change would take eﬀect.
If both of these tactics are implemented, we would become
more reliant on local contacts to provide reports of products
being used (e.g., because of access to internal IP address
space) in their region. Alternatively, we could apply the
techniques of Section 4 more widely, but scalability issues
would make this time consuming.
6.2 Conﬁrming censorship
URL ﬁltering products view their database of URLs as a
key diﬀerentiator to their business, and many even adver-
tise the number of URLs they have classiﬁed and the rate at
which they add to their databases [19]. By allowing individ-
uals/administrators to submit sites to be blocked in diﬀerent
categories, they eﬀectively crowdsource the database main-
tenance process. As a result of this, vendors are unlikely to
reject all submissions based on our approach.
However, they may attempt to identify our submissions
and disregard them. The can be accomplished by identifying
either (1) our IP or e-mail address when we submit URLs,
or (2) hosting services we use to host the domains under
our control (§4). The ﬁrst is easy for us to evade using
proxy services or Tor and many e-mail addresses from free
Webmail providers. The second can be evaded by using a
popular cloud or hosting provider for our URLs, thus making
blocking URLs from the given provider too damaging to the
vendor’s database.
Even though we may be able to counter evasion tactics by
vendors, such a cat-and-mouse game is undesirable. Thus,
the design of more scalable techniques, that can use our
methodology to provide ground truth, is critical for contin-
ued study of URL ﬁltering technologies.
7. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a methodology for identifying instal-
lations of speciﬁc URL ﬁltering products and conﬁrmed their
use for censorship in networks with in-country testers. Through
our case studies, we have conﬁrmed the use of North Amer-
ican products to block content protected by human rights
norms in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Yemen.
Future work. While our methodology moves us be-
yond manual analysis of these products, it still poses many
challenges in terms of scalability. Speciﬁcally, the meth-
ods in Section 4 require that we identify which categories
are blocked in each ISP before creating test sites. Further,
these methods also require vantage points in the network
being considered. We hope this paper spurs dialog in the
network measurement community about how to character-
ize URL ﬁltering products in a high conﬁdence, yet scalable,
way. Indeed, our methodology can provide a useful ground
truth for more general identiﬁcation of transparent proxies
(e.g.,
[12, 17]) to yield a more complete picture of URL
ﬁltering deployments.
