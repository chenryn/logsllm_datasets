### 4.5 Case Study: Blue Coat in the UAE

**Challenge 3: URL Filtering and Network Management Tools in Tandem**

In this study, we examine how different products can be used together to achieve an ISP's objectives. For instance, software like SmartFilter can be configured to run on proxy appliances such as Blue Coat’s ProxySG. This combination is observed in Etisalat, a major ISP in the UAE. We confirmed that Etisalat uses SmartFilter for URL filtering (as detailed in §4.3). Additionally, our methodology (Section 3) identified installations of Blue Coat products within Etisalat.

To further investigate, we created a set of test URLs and submitted them to the "Proxy avoidance" category for filtering by Blue Coat. These URLs were chosen because we had previously observed proxies being blocked using SmartFilter. Upon testing these URLs in Etisalat, none were blocked. This suggests that while both vendors' products are in use, they may be employed to block different types of content. The more likely explanation, however, is that Etisalat uses SmartFilter for URL filtering, with Blue Coat’s ProxySG providing additional traffic management capabilities, such as policy enforcement and traffic shaping.

### 4.6 Ethical Considerations

The case studies presented raise several ethical issues related to the use of vendor-provided interfaces for submitting websites. We emphasize that our approach does not compromise the intended performance of the URL filters, as we do not affect the classification of legitimate websites. Furthermore, since the websites we submit are under our control, there is no collateral damage to existing sites. In the case of using a pornographic image in Saudi Arabia, we promptly removed the image after our tests. To minimize testers’ exposure to the pornographic content, we had them access a benign image file on the host rather than the page containing the offensive content. Our tests indicated that even the benign content was blocked, suggesting that blocking occurred at the hostname level. Thus, this method of mitigating user risk did not impact the results.

### 5. Characterizing Censored Content

Having developed a methodology to identify and confirm the use of URL filters, we now consider the type of content these products are blocking. We determined the types of blocked content by querying lists of URLs through the measurement client (§4.1). Two lists of URLs were tested in each country: a "global list" of internationally relevant content, which is consistent across all countries, and a "local list" of locally relevant content, designed by regional experts and unique to each country. Each URL on these lists was assigned to one of 40 content categories (e.g., "human rights" or "gambling") under four general themes: political, social, Internet tools, and conflict/security content.

Tests using the measurement client to characterize the censored content were performed within 30 days of the confirmations in Section 4. Manual analysis identified regular expressions corresponding to the vendors' block pages, and automated analysis identified all URLs matching a given block page regular expression.

Results, presented in Table 4, show that all products are used to block a wide variety of content, including oppositional and critical political content, non-pornographic gay and lesbian content, human rights content, independent media, and content related to minority groups and religious discussions. The blocking of such content contradicts internationally recognized human rights frameworks, such as Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [33].

### 6. Discussion

In this paper, we present an initial methodology for identifying and confirming the use of URL filtering products globally and highlight the challenges faced when applying this methodology. We now discuss how our techniques would fare against vendors attempting to mask their products. Table 5 summarizes these limitations. It is important to note that the identification of products and the confirmation of their use for censorship are independent; thus, the confirmation (§4) remains robust even if the techniques in Section 3 are evaded.

#### 6.1 Identifying and Validating Installations

While our identification method serves as a useful filter, we observe that URL filter vendors can take simple steps to evade discovery. Vendors could provide ISPs with scripts and configuration instructions to prevent their products from being visible on the global Internet. However, this relies on the ISP implementing these correctly. Vendors may also remove evidence of their products from protocol headers, which is relatively easy but requires all ISPs running the product to perform a software update.

If both tactics are implemented, we would become more reliant on local contacts to report the use of products (e.g., due to access to internal IP address space) in their region. Alternatively, we could apply the techniques of Section 4 more widely, but scalability issues would make this time-consuming.

#### 6.2 Confirming Censorship

URL filtering products view their database of URLs as a key differentiator for their business, often advertising the number of URLs they classify and the rate at which they add to their databases [19]. By allowing individuals/administrators to submit sites to be blocked in different categories, they effectively crowdsource the database maintenance process. As a result, vendors are unlikely to reject all submissions based on our approach.

However, they may attempt to identify and disregard our submissions. This can be done by identifying either (1) our IP or email address when we submit URLs, or (2) the hosting services we use to host the domains under our control (§4). The first can be evaded using proxy services or Tor and multiple free webmail providers. The second can be evaded by using popular cloud or hosting providers for our URLs, making it too damaging for the vendor to block URLs from these providers.

Although we can counter evasion tactics, a cat-and-mouse game is undesirable. Therefore, designing more scalable techniques that can use our methodology to provide ground truth is critical for continued study of URL filtering technologies.

### 7. Conclusions

We have presented a methodology for identifying installations of specific URL filtering products and confirming their use for censorship in networks with in-country testers. Through our case studies, we have confirmed the use of North American products to block content protected by human rights norms in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Yemen.

**Future Work:** While our methodology moves beyond manual analysis, it still poses many challenges in terms of scalability. Specifically, the methods in Section 4 require us to identify which categories are blocked in each ISP before creating test sites. Additionally, these methods require vantage points within the network being considered. We hope this paper spurs dialogue in the network measurement community about how to characterize URL filtering products in a high-confidence, yet scalable, way. Indeed, our methodology can provide a useful ground truth for more general identification of transparent proxies (e.g., [12, 17]) to yield a more complete picture of URL filtering deployments.
