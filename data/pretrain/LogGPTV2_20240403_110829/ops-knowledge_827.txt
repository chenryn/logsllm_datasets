Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and FSNamesystem components of a distributed file system communicating with each other. The DataNode is receiving blocks of data from various sources, and the FSNamesystem is allocating and adding stored blocks to the block map. Additionally, the FSNamesystem is asking certain nodes to delete blocks.
