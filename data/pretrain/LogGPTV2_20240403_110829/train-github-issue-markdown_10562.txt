I am seeking a method to programmatically set a "Remember Me" cookie from within a service, bypassing the standard form login process. However, I have noticed that all the "Remember Me" services in Symfony 2.4 are private and therefore not directly accessible. Is there an alternative approach to achieve this functionality? 

Thank you for any guidance or suggestions.
