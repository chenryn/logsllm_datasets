#### Who & What are we?
- **Human**
- **Potentially a hiring manager**
- **Hacker with little to no work experience in the field**
- **Hacker with experience looking for their next opportunity**

#### Why are we talking about this at DEFCON?
- Many talks focus on how to be a better penetration tester and use new tools, but few address the challenging hiring process in InfoSec.
- We desperately need people with the technical skills hackers possess.
- Both sides—hiring managers and candidates—are often ineffective in the hiring and interviewing process.

#### Why are we talking about this at DEFCON?
This talk draws from our experiences (and those of others in the community) as both interviewers and interviewees to help prepare hackers to enter or move within "the industry." We also aim to provide guidance to hiring managers on how to attract and retain the right talent.

#### Why are we talking about this at DEFCON?
- "It is hard to find people to hire."
- We often scare and confuse HR and recruiters.
- Both hackers and hiring managers make mistakes in the process.
- Getting and retaining talent is, in many ways, a social engineering exercise.

#### Social Engineering Exercise (Hiring Manager’s Perspective)
- **Attracting candidates to apply**
- **Avoiding bottlenecks at HR**
- **Finding an appropriate offer that upper management approves**
- **Ensuring the candidate accepts the offer**
- **Onboarding the candidate on day one**
- **Nurturing the candidate for personal and professional growth**

#### Social Engineering Exercise (Job Hunter’s Perspective)
- **Writing a convincing resume/cover letter to get past HR**
- **Navigating the interviewing process (hiring managers and beyond)**
- **Negotiating a suitable offer**
- **Showing up on day one and onboarding**

#### EXPECTATIONS
- **Core Problem aka Opportunity #1: Expectations**
  - "Can't find anyone to hire!" vs. "Must work in our corporate office in Wichita, initially on a six-month contract with a rotating SOC shift cycle!"
  - Winn Schwartau discusses "Hiring the Unhireable," noting that we unintentionally create a sub-category of talent we will never hire.

#### Hiring the Unhireable
- **What do you want?**
  - Job expectations can be unclear. A "Junior" or "Entry-level" position might require CISSP certification or five years of experience.
  - Position descriptions can be vague, seeking a jack-of-all-trades.
  - Newcomers to InfoSec either apply for everything or nothing, unsure of what hiring managers are looking for.

- **Tell us what you want**
  - Be clear about the job responsibilities.
  - If you need a log analyst, specify that.

- **What really matters?**
  - To your environment, team, and business?
  - Experience level (entry-level or senior)?
  - Certifications and/or degrees?
  - Avoid asking for things just because; it limits your applicant pool.
  - Determine what level of experience you can afford.

- **Certifications? Degree?**
  - What certifications can you afford?
  - Consider potential discrimination.

- **Scope?**
  - **Dedicated roles:**
    - Analyst (data analysis)
    - Engineer (toolset management)
    - Architect (strategic planning)
    - Forensics
    - Malware
    - Penetration tester
  - **Application vs. Network/System Security:**
    - Vendor, software/hardware developer

- **ALL THE THINGS!**
  - **Jack of all trades?**
    - Master of none
    - Consider career growth and team welfare
    - Prevent burnout

- **Where do they fit?**
  - Organizational fit
  - Direct report (reporting to IT, legal, etc.)
  - Potential conflicts of interest
  - Startups: a Security Architect is not a replacement for a CISO

#### Hacker Expectations
- **Apply, and the job is yours!**
  - For as much money as you want!
  - With no bureaucracy to deal with!
  - All the tools you want or the freedom to create your own!
  - With a free pass to hacker summer camp!

#### THE APPLICATION PROCESS
- **Core Problem aka Opportunity #2: The Application Process**
  - Both parties should prepare before the first call to set up an interview.
  - Timing is crucial; a candidate could be hired elsewhere before you send your first reply.

- **How Do You Find Candidates?**
  - Involvement in local IT and InfoSec communities, meetups, mailing lists, forums, and professional meetings.
  - Posting online (Monster, CareerBuilder, Beyond, Craigslist, Reddit, closed IT/InfoSec communities).

- **Your Role as a Hiring Manager**
  - Nurture talent in the field.
  - Promote and screen through local groups.
  - Ensure HR/recruiting staff set a positive tone for the process.

- **Consider the Types of Questions**
  - Carefully consider questions before the interview.
  - Respect the sensitivities of the applications.
  - Balance fact-based and essay/short answer questions.
  - Share and divvy up questions among the team to avoid duplication.

- **Defining Key Areas**
  - Define key areas/topics.
  - Test/evaluate for specific skills or general knowledge.
  - Match skills to the position description and tailor questions per candidate.

- **Questioning Compensation**
  - Know the salary range and pay accordingly.
  - Offer incentives like flexible work schedules, remote work, and training budgets.

- **Application Tracking Systems (ATS)**
  - Ensure the ATS does not require PII/NPPI.
  - Test and validate the application process.
  - Avoid common application fails.

- **Hack Your Resume**
  - Reflect your background and role accurately.
  - Tailor your resume to the employer/hiring manager.
  - Use relevant file names and sanitize metadata.

- **Heavyweight ATS**
  - Be one of the first to apply.
  - Fill out every applicable text box.
  - Format your resume for computer readability (no graphics, special characters, web-safe fonts, spell check).

- **Email Applications**
  - Quick and easy to apply, but easy to get lost.
  - Use a strong subject line.
  - Include a cover letter in the body of the email.
  - Add a digital signature if possible.

- **USAJobs Applications**
  - Government roles have dedicated websites (e.g., USAJobs).
  - Similar to heavyweight ATS, be thorough and answer qualifier questions.

- **Customized Resumes**
  - Full CV with buzzword bingo for ATS.
  - 1-2 page resume for human digestion.

- **Don’t Hack With Your Resume**
  - Submit resumes as text, RTF, or PDF.
  - Do not insert malicious code or trackers.

- **Security Clearances**
  - Do not include security clearances on your resume or social media.
  - This information makes you a bigger target and looks unprofessional.

By following these guidelines, both hiring managers and job seekers can improve the hiring process and build a more effective and efficient InfoSec workforce.
