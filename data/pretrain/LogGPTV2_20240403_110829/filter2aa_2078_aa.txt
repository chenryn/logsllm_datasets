Who & What are we?
Who & What are you?
● Human
● Potentially a hiring manager
● Hacker with little to no work experience in 
the field
● Hacker with experience looking for their next 
opportunity
Why are we talking about this at 
DEFCON?
● Lots of talks about how to be a better pen tester and 
how to use all of the cool new tools, but only a few talks 
that address what some of us consider to be the hardest 
part of getting a job in InfoSec: the hiring process. 
● We desperately need people with the technical skills 
hackers have 
● Both sides of the table are doing horribly when it comes 
to hiring and interviewing for work.
Why are we talking about this at 
DEFCON?
This talk takes our experiences (and that of others in the 
community) as both interviewers and interviewees in order 
to help better prepare hackers to enter (or move within) 
“the industry”. We also want to let the people making 
hiring decisions know what they can do to get the people 
and experience they need.
Why are we talking about this at 
DEFCON?
● “It is hard to find people to hire”
● We scare and confuse some HR and recruiters
● We (hackers and hiring managers alike) keep 
shooting ourselves in this process
● Getting and retaining talent is in some ways a 
social engineering exercise
Social Engineering Exercise 
(Hiring Manager’s Perspective)
● Get individuals interested in applying
● Avoid bottlenecks at HR
● Finding an appropriate offer that upper 
management approves of
● The acceptance of the offer by the candidate 
● Having the candidate show up on day one 
and onboarded
● Nurturing the candidate so they grow 
personally and professionally
Social Engineering Exercise 
(Job Hunter’s Perspective)
● Writing a convincing resume/cover letter to 
get past the HR gateway
● The interviewing process (hiring managers 
and beyond)
● Get (or negotiate) a suitable offer
● Show up on day one & onboarding
EXPECTATIONS
Core Problem aka Opportunity #1
Expectations
"Can't find anyone to hire!"
vs
"Must work in our corporate office in Wichita, 
initially on a six month contract to fire with 
rotating SOC shift cycle!"
Winn Schwartau talks about “Hiring the 
UnHireable”
“... intentionally or not—is create a sub-category 
of talent whom we will never hire. The 
Unhireable. ...”

Hiring the UnHireable
What do you want?
● Expectations for jobs can be unclear 
○ The job title may say a “Junior” or “Entry-level”, but 
then it asks for CISSP certification or 5 years of 
experience
● Position Description (PD) could be all over the map, 
looking for jack of all trades (master of none)
● Folks looking to break into InfoSec end up either 
applying for everything or nothing 
○ They honestly have no idea what hiring managers 
are looking for, but they want to try regardless.
Tell us what you want
What you really, really 
want?
● Be clear with what 
the job will entail
● If you want a log 
monkey, say you want 
a log monkey
What do you want?
● What really matters?
○ To your environment, your team, the biz?
● Experience?
○ Entry-level or someone more senior
● Certs and/or a degree?
● Do not ask for things “just because”
○ Limits your pool of applicants
● What level of experience can you afford?
Certifications? Degree?
● What really matters?
● What certifications can you afford?
● Discrimination?
Scope?
● Dedicated role 
○ Analyst (Digging through the data)
○ Engineer (Running the toolsets)
○ Architect (Strategic view)
○ Forensics
○ Malware 
○ Penetration tester
● Application vs Network/System Security
○ Vendor, developer of software/hardware
ALL THE THINGS!
●  ‘Jack of all trades’?
○ Master of none
○ Consider career growth
○ Health and welfare of team
○ Burnout
Where do they fit?
● Organizational fit
● Direct report
○ Reporting to IT? 
Legal?
■ Consider potential 
conflicts of interest
○ Startups: a Security 
Architect is not a 
replacement for a 
CISO
Hacker Expectations
● Apply, and the job is yours!
○ For as much money as 
you want!
○ With no bureaucracy to 
deal with!
○ All the tools you want - 
or the freedom to create 
your own!
○ With a free pass to 
hacker summer camp!
THE APPLICATION PROCESS
Core Problem aka Opportunity #2
The Application Process
● Preparation by both parties should be done 
before the first calls are made to set up an 
interview
○ Seldom done, let alone done well
● Timing is everything
○ Candidate could have finished the 
application process, hired, and started 
elsewhere before you send your first reply 
How Do you Find Candidates?
● Involvement in 
○ Local IT & InfoSec communities/Meetups
○ Mailing lists & forums 
○ Local tech/college professional meetings
● Posting online
○ Monster, CareerBuilder, Beyond, etc.
○ Craigslist
○ Reddit
○ Closed IT/InfoSec communities & lists
How Do you Find Candidates?
● One of your obligations as a hiring manager, as 
a leader in InfoSec is to nurture talent in our 
field
● Your involvement in the local groups helps 
promote & screen
HR/recruiter teams
● Paid recruiters, overseas body shops
● Recruiter roadblocks
○ Sends the screening questionnaire, expecting 
the applicant to do their work
■ Starts off with a poor experience
■ Candidates will go elsewhere
● Your HR/recruiting staff and their initial contacts 
and conversations with candidates set the tone 
for the process, ensure they are good ones
○ Sets up expectations for the next step(s)
Consider the types of questions
● Carefully consider the types of questions you want 
to ask BEFORE the interview
● Respect the sensitivities of the applications in your 
questions
● Creating the interviews
○ Balancing fact based questions vs essay/short
○ Does your team share questions?
○ How do you divvy up who asks what
■ Do you avoid duplication? 
Defining Key Areas
● How do you define key areas/topics?
● Testing/evaluating for specific skills? Or more 
General?
● How do you match up skills to the Position 
description, then the areas to question per 
candidate? 
Questioning Compensation
● Salary history
○ You know the range, pay them what they are 
worth
○ Incentives 
■ Flexible work schedule
■ Work from home
■ Training budget
Application Tracking Systems (ATS)
● Ensure the ATS you use doesn’t require PII/NPPI 
○ SSANs in BrassRing
● Test and validate your application process
○ Get a friend to apply, do they make it through the 
process? Past HR at least?  
● Avoid the common application fails
○ The initial impressions last
[Insert ATS fail screenshot examples here]
[Redacted to protect the guilty]
Hack your resume
● Experience reflects your background and the 
role
○ No BS, No stretching the truth
○ Careful on the buzzword bingo
■ Enough to match the role in the big HR
■ Know what the terms mean
Hack your Resume
● Tailor your resume to make it relevant to the 
employer/hiring manager
● Have your resume/CV as long as it needs to be.
○ Is your resume long enough so it reaches 
where it's supposed to go?
● 1 or 2 page resume, and a full CV
○ Different hiring managers, different 
preferences
Hack your Resume
● File names make a difference
○ Distinguish yourself from other candidates
○ Managers make mistakes, and lose 
documents; good labeling helps you out.
● Sanitize the metadata
○ The downloaded template has a surprise...
Application Tracking Systems
● There are different Application Tracking 
Systems (ATS)
○ Heavyweight application systems with data 
mining looking for keywords & the basic 
application management
■ Taleo, iCIMS, SuccessFactors, 
PeopleSoft, Bullhorn, Brassring 
○ Lightweight application tracking
■ Workday, Jobvite, SilkRoad, LinkedIn, 
SmartRecruiters
Heavyweight ATS
● Be one of the first to apply
● Fill out every applicable text box
● Resume/CV formatting for computer 
readable 
○ No graphics or special characters
○ Web safe fonts
○ Spell check
○ Skills section as complete and truthful as 
possible
Email Applications
● Quick and easy to apply, easy to get lost
● Subject line is important
● Include a cover letter in the body of the email
● Digital signature is a bonus
USAJobs Applications
● Government roles have dedicated websites 
for applications
○ For USA, USAJobs 
■ Mostly, some .GOV still have their own
● Similar to the heavyweight ATS 
○ Unwieldy
○ Be sure to answer the qualifier questions
○ Review the application process for the 
surprise essay questions
Customised Resumes 
● The full CV with buzzword bingo for the 
heavyweight application systems
○ Import, then tweak details
● The 1 or 2 page resume for human digestion
○ Include with application as well
Don’t Hack With Your Resume
● Submit resumes as text, RTF, and/or PDF
● Do not insert malicious code or trackers into 
your resume or cover letter
○ Nor should you conduct a penetration test on 
the application systems
Security Clearances
● Do not belong on the resume
● Do not belong on your social media profiles
● This information makes you a bigger target
○ And look like a moron
● DSS/OPM does not look kindly on this
