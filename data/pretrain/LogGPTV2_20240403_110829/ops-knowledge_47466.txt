### Issue: Installing AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI) on Ubuntu

**Problem Description:**
I encountered an error while trying to install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI) on my Ubuntu machine. After installing it with the command `pip install --upgrade --user awsebcli`, I received the following error when attempting to check the EB version with `eb --version`:

```plaintext

```

**Resolution:**

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Upgrade pip:**
   Ensure that you have the latest version of `pip` installed. You can upgrade `pip` using the following command:
   ```sh
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. **Reinstall the EB CLI:**
   After upgrading `pip`, reinstall the EB CLI with the following command:
   ```sh
   pip install --upgrade --user awsebcli
   ```

**Verification:**
After completing the above steps, verify the installation by checking the EB version:
```sh
eb --version
```

If the installation is successful, you should see the version number of the EB CLI without any errors.

By following these steps, I was able to resolve the issue and successfully install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface on my Ubuntu machine.
