## Abstract
This paper introduces efficient group key distribution techniques for large and dynamic groups over unreliable channels. The proposed methods are based on the self-healing key distribution methods (with revocation capability) developed by Staddon et al. [27]. By introducing a novel personal key distribution technique, this paper reduces:
1. The communication overhead of personal key share distribution from \(O(t^2 \log q)\) to \(O(t \log q)\),
2. The communication overhead of self-healing key distribution with t-revocation capability from \(O((mt^2 + tm) \log q)\) to \(O(mt \log q)\),
3. The storage overhead of the self-healing key distribution with t-revocation capability at each group member from \(O(m^2 \log q)\) to \(O(m \log q)\),
where \(t\) is the maximum number of colluding group members, \(m\) is the number of sessions, and \(q\) is a sufficiently large prime number to accommodate a cryptographic key. These improvements are achieved without compromising the unconditional security of key distribution. Additionally, this paper presents two techniques that allow a trade-off between the broadcast size and the recoverability of lost session keys, further reducing the broadcast message size in scenarios with frequent but short-term disruptions and long-term but infrequent disruptions.

## 1. Introduction
Wireless networks, especially mobile wireless ad hoc networks, are ideal for applications such as military operations, rescue missions, and scientific explorations, where there is often no network infrastructure support. In such environments, security is a top concern, particularly ensuring that adversaries cannot access or interrupt wireless communications. Encryption and authentication are common ways to ensure secure communication. In mobile wireless networks, a sender may broadcast encrypted and authenticated messages to team members, and only nodes with valid keys can access or verify these messages. The challenge is how to distribute cryptographic keys to valid nodes.

Techniques developed for secure group communications in traditional networks (e.g., LKH [32, 33]) can be used for key distribution in mobile wireless networks. However, unique features of mobile wireless networks introduce new problems. Nodes may frequently move in and out of range, and adversaries may disrupt communication. Techniques without fault-tolerant features or those using error correction codes in traditional ways (e.g., Keystone [34]) are not fully effective, especially in large, dynamic wireless networks. Additionally, devices in mobile wireless networks are typically battery-powered, and power-consuming techniques such as public key cryptography reduce device lifetime.

Among existing group key distribution techniques, self-healing key distribution [27] and stateless key distribution [20] are potential candidates for large mobile wireless networks. Self-healing key distribution allows group members to recover lost session keys, while stateless key distribution permits group members to get up-to-date session keys even if they miss some previous key distribution messages.

In this paper, we develop novel self-healing group key distribution schemes for large and dynamic groups over unreliable channels based on the techniques proposed in [27], addressing highly mobile, volatile, and hostile wireless networks. By introducing a novel personal key distribution technique, we reduce:
1. The communication overhead of personal key share distribution from \(O(t^2 \log q)\) to \(O(t \log q)\),
2. The communication overhead of self-healing key distribution with t-revocation capability from \(O((mt^2 + tm) \log q)\) to \(O(mt \log q)\),
3. The storage overhead of the self-healing key distribution with t-revocation capability at each group member from \(O(m^2 \log q)\) to \(O(m \log q)\),
where \(t\) is the maximum number of colluding group members, \(m\) is the number of sessions, and \(q\) is a sufficiently large prime number to accommodate a cryptographic key. These results are achieved without sacrificing the unconditional security of key distribution. Additionally, we develop two techniques that allow a trade-off between the broadcast size and the recoverability of lost session keys, addressing situations with frequent but short-term disruptions and long-term but infrequent disruptions.

The proposed key distribution schemes have several advantages:
1. They are self-healing, allowing wireless nodes to recover lost keys even if they are separated from the network during key distribution.
2. They do not require heavy computation, and wireless nodes can get or recover keys by passively listening to broadcast key distribution messages, reducing power consumption and prolonging device lifetime.
3. They distribute keys via true broadcast, conforming to the nature of wireless networks.
4. They are scalable to very large groups, with processing, communication, and storage overheads independent of the group size but dependent on the number of compromised group members that may collude together.

Our contributions are:
1. A novel personal key distribution scheme for efficient distribution of different key shares to different group members via a broadcast channel.
2. An efficient self-healing key distribution scheme with reduced storage and communication overhead compared to [27].
3. Two techniques to trade off self-healing capability with broadcast size, reducing communication overhead in bandwidth-constrained applications.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model and notations. Section 3 details our approaches. Section 4 reviews related existing techniques. Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests future directions.

## 2. Our Model

### 2.1 Communication Model
To focus on the key distribution problem, we adopt a simplified group communication model. We assume that communication entities in a wireless network form groups to control access to broadcast messages. There may be more than one group, with certain relationships between them (e.g., members of the captain group are also members of the soldier group). Without loss of generality, we will focus on one group unless multiple groups are necessary. The lifetime of a wireless network is partitioned into time intervals called sessions. The duration of sessions may be fixed or dynamic due to changes in group membership. One or several group managers are responsible for distributing group (session) keys to authorized group members. Only group members with valid group keys can broadcast authenticated messages and access encrypted broadcast messages. A sender may transmit a broadcast message directly to other group members or indirectly through network components (e.g., wireless routers) or other group members.

Mobile wireless networks are highly volatile, with nodes frequently moving in and out of range and no infrastructure support for reliable message delivery. Therefore, we do not assume reliable communication; a message sent to a group may or may not reach all members.

### 2.2 Threat Model
We assume an adversary may passively listen to, or actively insert, intercept, modify, or drop broadcast messages. Our goal is to ensure the group manager can distribute group keys to group members as long as they can receive some broadcast messages. If the adversary completely jams the communication channel, our approach will not work, but we assume other means (e.g., spread spectrum) can defeat signal jamming. We also consider the possibility that the adversary may compromise one or more group members (e.g., by capturing and analyzing devices). Our goal is to ensure that once detected, such group members will be revoked, and the adversary must compromise more than \(t\) devices to defeat our approach, where \(t\) is a system parameter.

### 2.3 Notations
Each group member is uniquely identified by an ID number \(i\), where \(i \in \{1, ..., n\}\) and \(n\) is the largest ID number, denoted as \(U_i\). All operations take place in a finite field \(\mathbb{F}_q\), where \(q\) is a sufficiently large prime number. Each group member \(U_i\) stores a personal secret \(S_i \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q\), representing all information the group member may use to recover the session keys. We use \(H(\cdot)\) to denote the entropy function of information theory [9]. We use \(K_j\) to denote the session key that the group manager distributes to the group members in session \(j\), and \(k_i\) to denote the personal key of group member \(U_i\). Note that to enable the group manager to revoke \(U_i\) when necessary, \(k_i\) cannot be computed only from \(S_i\); it must also depend on information distributed by the group manager.

The group manager distributes the session key among the group via a broadcast message. We use \(B_j\) to denote the broadcast message, called the session key distribution message, that the group manager uses to distribute the group session key during session \(j\). We use \(z_{i,j}\) to denote what the group member \(U_i\) learns from its own personal secret \(S_i\) and \(B_j\). We use \(R_j\) to denote the set of revoked group members in session \(j\), which contains all revoked members since the beginning of session key distribution. We reserve the letter \(t\) to represent the number of compromised group members. We aim to develop techniques resistant to adversaries who can compromise \(t\) group members (or, equivalently, the coalition of up to \(t\) revoked group members).

### 2.4 Goals
Our general goal is to develop efficient and unconditionally secure key distribution schemes for mobile wireless networks. The resulting techniques should tolerate the volatile nature of mobile wireless networks and the compromise of past group members. We are particularly interested in practical solutions deployable in current or next-generation wireless networks.

To clarify our goals and facilitate the later presentation, we provide the following definitions:

**Definition 1. (Personal Key Distribution [27])**
Let \(t, i \in \{1, ..., n\}\). In a personal key distribution scheme \(D\), the group manager seeks to establish a new key \(k_i \in \mathbb{F}_q\) with each group member \(U_i\) through a broadcast message \(B\).

1. \(D\) is a personal key distribution scheme if:
   - For any group member \(U_i\), \(k_i\) is determined by \(S_i\) and \(B\) (i.e., \(H(k_i|B, S_i) = 0\)).
   - For any set \(B \subseteq \{U_1, ..., U_n\}\), \(|B| \leq t\), and any \(U_i \notin B\), the members in \(B\) are not able to learn anything about \(S_i\) (i.e., \(H(k_i, S_i|\{S_i\}_{U_i \in B}, B) = H(k_i, S_i)\)).
   - No information on \(\{k_i\}_{i \in \{1,...,n\}}\) is learned from either the broadcast or the personal secrets alone (i.e., \(H(k_1, ..., k_n|B) = H(k_1, ..., k_n) = H(k_1, ..., k_n|S_1, ..., S_n)\)).

2. \(D\) has t-revocation capability if, given any \(R \subseteq \{U_1, ..., U_n\}\) such that \(|R| \leq t\), the group manager can generate a broadcast \(B\), such that for all \(U_i \notin R\), \(U_i\) can recover \(k_i\) (i.e., \(H(k_i|B, S_i) = 0\)), but the revoked group members cannot recover any of the keys (i.e., \(H(k_1, ..., k_n|B, \{S_i\}_{U_i \in R}) = H(k_1, ..., k_n)\)).

**Definition 2. (Session Key Distribution with b-bit privacy)**
Let \(t, i \in \{1, ..., n\}\) and \(j \in \{1, ..., m\}\).

1. \(D\) is a key distribution scheme with b-bit privacy if:
   - For any member \(U_i\), \(K_j\) is determined by \(z_{i,j}\), which in turn is determined by \(B_j\) and \(S_i\) (i.e., \(H(K_j|z_{i,j}) = 0\) and \(H(z_{i,j}|B_j, S_i) = 0\)).
   - For any \(B \subseteq \{U_1, ..., U_n\}\), \(|B| \leq t\), and \(U_i \notin B\), the members in \(B\) are not able to learn anything about \(K_j\) (i.e., \(H(K_j|\{z_{i,j}\}_{U_i \in B}, B_j) = H(K_j)\)).
