ABSTRACT
This paper presents group key distribution techniques for large and
dynamic groups over unreliable channels. The techniques proposed
here are based on the self-healing key distribution methods (with
revocation capability) recently developed by Staddon et al. [27].
By introducing a novel personal key distribution technique, this pa-
per reduces (1) the communication overhead of personal key share
distribution from O(t2 log q) to O(t log q), (2) the communication
overhead of self-healing key distribution with t-revocation capabil-
ity from O((mt2 + tm) log q) to O(mt log q), and (3) the storage
overhead of the self-healing key distribution with t-revocation ca-
pability at each group member from O(m2 log q) to O(m log q),
where t is the maximum number of colluding group members, m
is the number of sessions, and q is a prime number that is large
enough to accommodate a cryptographic key. All these results are
achieved without sacriﬁcing the unconditional security of key dis-
tribution. In addition, this paper presents two techniques that al-
low trade-off between the broadcast size and the recoverability of
lost session keys. These two methods further reduce the broadcast
message size in situations where there are frequent but short-term
disruptions of communication and where there are long-term but
infrequent disruptions of communication, respectively.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless networks, especially mobile wireless ad hoc networks,
are ideal candidates for communications in applications such as
military operations, rescue missions, and scientiﬁc explorations,
where there is usually no network infrastructure support. In situa-
tions where there are adversaries who may want to intercept and/or
interrupt the communication, security becomes one of the top con-
cerns. In particular, it is critical to make sure that the adversaries
cannot access or interrupt the wireless communication, and even if
they do, it is possible to recover from such compromises quickly.
A common way to ensure communication security is to encrypt
and authenticate the messages.
In mobile wireless networks, a
sender may broadcast encrypted and/or authenticated messages to
his/her team members, and only nodes with valid keys can have ac-
cess to and/or verify these messages. The remaining challenge is
how to distribute the cryptographic keys to valid nodes.
Theoretically, all techniques developed for secure group commu-
nications in traditional networks (e.g., LKH [32, 33]) can be used
for key distribution in mobile wireless networks. However, some
unique features of mobile wireless networks introduce new prob-
lems that have not been fully considered. First, nodes in mobile
wireless networks may move in and out of range frequently, and
sometimes be completely separate from the network. Moreover,
the adversary may intentionally disrupt the wireless communica-
tion using various methods. Thus, techniques without fault tolerant
features, or those that use error correction codes in traditional ways
(e.g., Keystone [34]) cannot fully address this problem, especially
in large, dynamic wireless networks (e.g., military networks con-
sisting of mobile devices carried by soldiers, automatic weapons,
sensing devices, etc.). Second, devices in mobile wireless networks
are typically powered by batteries. It will reduce the lifetime of
the batteries, and thus the availability of wireless devices, to adopt
some power-consuming techniques such as public key cryptogra-
phy. Thus, not all of the existing techniques are suitable for large
and dynamic wireless networks.
Among existing group key distribution techniques, two methods
are potential candidates for large mobile wireless networks: self-
healing key distribution [27] and stateless key distribution [20].
Self-healing key distribution allows group members to recover lost
session keys, while stateless group key distribution permits group
members to get up-to-date session keys (without recovering lost
keys) even if they miss some previous key distribution messages.
In this paper, we develop novel self-healing group key distribu-
tion schemes for large and dynamic groups over unreliable chan-
nels based on the techniques proposed in [27], aiming at address-
ing group key distribution in highly mobile, volatile and hostile
wireless networks. By introducing a novel personal key distribu-
tion technique, we reduce (1) the communication overhead of per-
sonal key share distribution from O(t2 log q) to O(t log q), (2) the
communication overhead of self-healing key distribution with t-
revocation capability from O((mt2 + tm) log q) to O(mt log q),
and (3) the storage overhead of the self-healing key distribution
with t-revocation capability at each group member from O(m2 log q)
to O(m log q), where t is the maximum number of colluding group
members, m is the number of sessions, and q is a prime number that
is large enough to accommodate a cryptographic key. All these re-
sults are achieved without sacriﬁcing the unconditional security of
key distribution. In addition, we develop two techniques that al-
low trade-off between the broadcast size and the recoverability of
lost session keys. These two methods address the situations where
there are frequent but short-term disruptions of communication and
where there are long-term but infrequent disruptions of communi-
cation, respectively.
The proposed key distribution schemes have several advantages,
which make these schemes very attractive for large mobile wire-
less networks. First, the proposed techniques are self-healing. A
wireless node can recover lost keys even if it is separated from the
network when the keys are distributed. Second, the proposed tech-
niques do not require heavy computation, and wireless nodes can
get or recover keys by passively listening to broadcast key distri-
bution messages. This is particularly important to devices in mo-
bile wireless networks, which are typically powered by batteries.
Reducing the computation and active communication can signif-
icantly reduce the power consumption and prolong the lifetime of
wireless devices. Third, the proposed techniques distribute keys via
true broadcast, conforming to the broadcast nature of wireless net-
works. Finally, the proposed techniques are scalable to very large
groups. The processing, communication, and storage overheads do
not depend on the size of the group, but on the number of compro-
mised group members that may collude together.
Our contributions in this paper are as follows. The ﬁrst, and
most fundamental contribution is the novel personal key distribu-
tion scheme that allows efﬁcient distribution of different key shares
to different group members via a broadcast channel. Second, based
on this technique, we develop an efﬁcient self-healing key distribu-
tion scheme that requires less storage and communication overhead
than those in [27]. Third, we further develop two ways to trade off
the self-healing capability with broadcast size, allowing less com-
munication overhead in bandwidth constrained applications.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
our model as well as notations to be used in this paper. Section
3 gives the details of our approaches. Section 4 reviews existing
techniques related to group key distribution. Section 5 concludes
this paper and points out some future directions.
2. OUR MODEL
Communication Model. To focus on the key distribution prob-
lem, we adopt a simpliﬁed group communication model. We as-
sume that communication entities in a wireless network form groups
to control access to broadcast messages. There may be more than
one group with certain relationships between them (e.g., members
of the captain group are also members of the soldier group). With-
out loss of generality, we will focus on the case of one group unless
it is necessary to discuss multiple groups. The lifetime of a wireless
network is partitioned into time intervals called sessions. The dura-
tion of sessions may be ﬁxed or dynamic due to the change of group
membership. There is one or several group managers that are re-
sponsible for distributing group (session) keys to a large number of
authorized group members. Only group members with valid group
keys can broadcast authenticated messages to other group members
and access encrypted broadcast messages. A sender may transmit
a broadcast message to the other group members (i.e., receivers)
directly, or indirectly through network components (e.g., wireless
routers) or other group members.
Mobile wireless networks are usually highly volatile. Wireless
nodes may move in and out of range frequently, and there is usu-
ally no infrastructure support to guarantee reliable delivery of mes-
sages. Thus, we do not assume reliable communication in our sys-
tem; a message sent to a group may or may not reach all the group
members.
Threat Model. We assume an adversary may passively listen
to, or actively insert, intercept and modify, or drop broadcast mes-
sages. Our goal is to ensure the group manager can distribute group
keys to group members as long as the group members can get some
of the broadcast messages. Certainly, our approach won’t work if
the adversary completely jams the communication channel. We as-
sume there are other means to defeat signal jamming (e.g., spread
spectrum). Moreover, we consider the possibility that the adversary
may compromise one or more group members (e.g., by capturing
and analyzing the devices). Our goal is to ensure that once de-
tected, such group members will be revoked from the group, and
the adversary has to compromise more than t devices to defeat our
approach, where t is a system parameter.
Notations. We assume each group member is uniquely identi-
ﬁed by an ID number i, where i ∈ {1, ..., n} and n is the largest ID
number, and denote the group member as Ui. All of our operations
take place in a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq, where q is a sufﬁciently large prime
number. Each group member Ui stores a personal secret Si ⊆ Fq,
which represents all information the group member may use to re-
cover the session keys. We use H(·) to denote the entropy function
of information theory [9]. We use Kj to denote the session key that
the group manager distributes to the group members in session j,
and ki to denote the personal key of group member Ui. Note that
to enable the group manager to revoke Ui when necessary, we can-
not allow ki to be computed only from Si. Instead, ki must also
depend on information distributed by the group manager.
The group manager distributes the session key among the group
via a broadcast message. We use Bj to denote the broadcast mes-
sage, called the session key distribution message, that the group
manager uses to distribute the group session key during session j.
We use zi,j to denote what the group member Ui learns from its
own personal secret Si and Bj. We use Rj to denote the set of
revoked group members in session j, which contains all of the re-
voked members since the beginning of session key distribution. We
reserve the letter t to represent the number of compromised group
members. We would like to develop techniques that are resistant
to adversaries who are able to compromise t group members (or,
equivalently, the coalition of up to t revoked group members).
Goals. Our general goal is to develop efﬁcient and uncondition-
ally secure key distribution schemes for mobile wireless networks.
The resulting techniques should be able to tolerate the volatile na-
ture of mobile wireless networks as well as compromise of past
group members. We are particularly interested in practical solu-
tions that can be deployed in the current or next generation wireless
networks.
To further clarify our goals and facilitate the later presentation,
we give the following deﬁnitions.
DEFINITION 1. (Personal Key Distribution [27]) Let t, i ∈
{1, ..., n}. In a personal key distribution scheme D, the group man-
ager seeks to establish a new key ki ∈ Fq with each group member
Ui through a broadcast message B.
1. D is a personal key distribution scheme if
B (i.e., H(ki|B, Si) = 0),
(a) for any group member Ui, ki is determined by Si and
(b) for any set B ⊆ {U1, ..., Un}, |B| ≤ t, and any Ui /∈
B, the members in B are not able to learn anything
about Si (i.e., H(ki, Si|{Si(cid:1)}Ui(cid:1) ∈B, B) = H(ki, Si)),
and
(c) no information on {ki}i∈{1,...,n} is learned from ei-
ther the broadcast or the personal secrets alone (i.e.,
H(k1, ..., kn|B) = H(k1, ..., kn) =
H(k1, ..., kn|S1, ..., Sn)).
2. D has t-revocation capability if given any R ⊆ {U1, ..., Un}
such that |R| ≤ t, the group manager can generate a broad-
cast B, such that for all Ui /∈ R, Ui can recover ki (i.e.,
H(ki|B, Si) = 0), but the revoked group members cannot
recover any of the keys (i.e., H(k1, ..., kn|B, {Si(cid:1)}Ui(cid:1) ∈R) =
H(k1, ..., kn)).
DEFINITION 2. (Session Key Distribution with b-bit privacy)
Let t, i ∈ {1, ..., n} and j ∈ {1, ..., m}.
1. D is a key distribution scheme with b-bit privacy if
(a) for any member Ui, Kj is determined by zi,j, which in
turn is determined by Bj and Si (i.e., H(Kj|zi,j) = 0
and H(zi,j|Bj , Si) = 0),
(b) for any B ⊆ {U1, ..., Un}, |B| ≤ t, and Ui /∈ B, the
