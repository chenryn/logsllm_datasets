ing away and it turning out to be ‘all lies’ which was harrow-
ing for participants living in a high-crime setting. In other
cases, participants talked about seeing nudity or being the
victims of revenge postings with sexual content about them.
P13: One time my friend called me and told me
to go and search for a particular person and I did
that and that person stays here in Langa and I saw
pictures of them naked.
I: what did you to stop that?
P13: I stopped searching for that person.
In some cases, this inappropriate content appeared on Sta-
tus messages which participants had no control over. For
instance, in one case, a participant spoke of seeing that a con-
tact had put a message on their Status about the father of their
children beating them up. In most of these cases, participants
spoke of just ‘taking a break’ from the platform or waiting for
the Status message to disappear after 24 hours since there was
no other way to avoid this content. Some participants spoke
of having to just ‘scroll past and log out’ to avoid the content
or logging off and taking a break to avoid seeing this content.
4.3.4 Social Media As Data Storage In Case Of Theft
A ﬁnal theme that emerged from the interviews, particularly
with the lower-income individuals, was the usage of social me-
dia platforms as a means of data storage to save information.
Participant used social media in this way due to the rampant
phone theft issues in South Africa, with more than 475,000
reported cell phone thefts this past year [27] and living in high-
crime areas. These participants explained that they wanted to
ensure that even if their devices were stolen, they would still
have access to the precious memories stored in pictures. In a
P45: I only post the pictures that I like and think are
nice. I also ensure that I post the pictures I would
like to have even after my phone has gone missing.
Another reason participants uploaded their images to social
media was owing to phone memory issues or in the event
that a phone malfunction occurred. At least 7 lower-income
participants reported that one of their primary uses for social
media was to upload their pictures to either Facebook or In-
stagram for later retrieval. One participant, P49, explained her
reasoning for this logic as an issue with how pictures were
currently being stored on her device.
I: Why do you post your pictures on Facebook?
P49: I want to keep them.
I: Oh so why do you keep them on Facebook? Why
can’t you keep them somewhere else?
P49: Memory cards have issues sometimes they
reformat themselves.
I: And Facebook never reformats?
P49: Never
That being said, those who employed this strategy admitted
that there were negative repercussions of their uploading all
of their photos to Facebook or Instagram, including not inter-
nalizing that what they post on Facebook is unlike a storage
platform by its very nature. For example, in one interview, a
participant mentioned her concern over the fact that anything
she uploaded for "storage" on Facebook would be able to be
seen by others, limiting her control over privacy.
I: What would make you want to use Facebook
again?
P43: If there was a guarantee that my pics cannot
be downloaded, then it would be ﬁne.
I: Why is protection of pictures so important to
you?
P43: For the sake of my privacy. So that nothing
negative can be circulated about me.
Using social media as a means to preserve their data in
the event of phone theft is one example of the intersection
between physical and digital privacy for our participants.
5 Discussion
Our ﬁndings show that users were primarily concerned about
other individuals seeing their posts, but did not know how
to control information visibility on social media platforms.
Moreover, our ﬁndings suggest that users struggled to manage
their privacy, particularly in contexts of shared devices. Our
ﬁndings also demonstrated that physical safety threats caused
our participants to desire non-real time posting and use social
media for data storage. Participants also experienced frequent
account hacking and were often encountering crime-related
1960    29th USENIX Security Symposium

content on social media that was sometimes disturbing. Based
on our ﬁndings, we make the following recommendations for
future work.
5.1 Challenge “Always online” Assumptions
Our study suggests that we need to challenge assumptions
about ‘typical’ users when designing privacy and security
settings such as that users are always online or have reliable,
frequent access to the Internet. These assumptions can dis-
advantage users in resource-constrained settings with high
data costs. For example, recovering from an account hacking
is difﬁcult if it requires you to follow a lengthy process that
requires constant connectivity. Additionally, the process of
changing privacy settings can also be lengthy; on WhatsApp,
which nearly all of the participants described as being better
for privacy than Facebook, navigating to the privacy settings
takes 2 clicks. On Facebook, the same process requires 3-4
clicks, depending on which route is taken. A suggestion would
be to bring those settings forward on all social media sites,
which could increase the knowledge and usage of the privacy
settings. Resource-constrained users could also beneﬁt from
lightweight privacy on-boarding interfaces and privacy and
security settings that can be conﬁgured ofﬂine. Designers
could also help users glean privacy-management related in-
formation from their social contacts when users are online.
Users could also be provided with familiar ways of ﬁnding
out information. For instance, an informational ‘WhatsApp’
chat-bot contact that will reply to natural language questions
with the desired information about privacy or security could
work well in these settings. Finally, most of our participants
rarely altered settings from their default states conﬁrming
other studies [24, 38]. Therefore, making posts more private
by default might be more apt in helping less tech-savvy users
maintain privacy.
5.2
Improve Data Compartmentalization On
Devices
Our participants, like others in settings where device sharing
is common, often encountered security and privacy issues
owing to shared devices. The security community could aid
with this issue by designing better ways to compartmentalize
data storage and access on a phone that is easy for a user to
understand, use, and manage. This underlying infrastructure
should afford users the ability to easily grant access to parts
of the device or data without causing social awkwardness or
overtly challenging power dynamics that are hard to avoid.
This requires technical innovation and further user studies.
5.3 Accommodate Use In High-Crime Areas
Finally, our participants were often concerned with their physi-
cal safety. Future work could examine if non-real time posting
would alleviate some physical safety concerns by allowing
users to schedule posts for later times. Systems to alert users
if their posts contain personal information that could be mis-
used or obfuscate certain information could also be beneﬁcial
in high-crime settings. Further work is also needed to un-
derstand how to improve content moderation mechanisms
for high-crime areas where inappropriate content and misin-
formation spread unchecked on social media platforms. For
instance, future work could examine how to help users, par-
ticularly on WhatsApp, better report and ﬂag inappropriate
content and overcome susceptibility to hacking from sharing
phones.
6 Study Limitations
Our study had a sample size of 52 users only. Additionally,
all of the participants, while living in different regions of the
city, all lived in Cape Town, South Africa. Further, interviews
were conducted in a semi-structured manner, meaning that
just because participants may not have explicitly discussed
something, that does not preclude them from having a view-
point on that subject. Lastly, due to the number of interviews
and the coding process used (3.4), it is possible that a par-
ticipant mentioned something that was not picked up during
our coding process. Our study can be extended to a wider
demographic in other settings with low income individuals.
Future work could investigate current privacy behaviors on
other social media platforms in depth (e.g., examining the
difference in preferences on WhatsApp versus Facebook)
to see how privacy can be better attained through different
types of settings and which settings are most appropriate for
marginalized settings.
7 Conclusion
Our study demonstrated that South African mobile users pri-
marily worry about who has access to their online data on
social media. Our participants were generally unaware about
granular privacy settings on social media platforms and had
to manage posting personal information in a high-crime area
that could mark them as a target. Our ﬁndings suggest the
security community needs to better accommodate users in
resource-constrained settings, improve data compartmental-
ization on devices, and design to help users in high-crime
areas use social media safely. Future work could implement
the suggested design recommendations and evaluate their ef-
fectiveness at improving privacy and security management for
users in resource-constrained settings.Future studies could in-
vestigate people’s knowledge of privacy breaches and online
tracking in resource-constrained settings.
