User: What is container technology, and what is its difference and connection with virtual machine technology? Please explain in detail.
Assistant: Container technology is a virtualization technology at the operating system level. By creating an independent user space, resources such as applications and the libraries they depend on can be isolated and shared in the same operating system instance. Container technology can package an application into a portable container, including resources such as the application and its dependent libraries, and can run in different environments, realizing cross-platform and seamless migration capabilities. Compared with virtual machine technology, container technology has the following differences and connections: 1. Virtualization technology uses Hypervisor to create multiple virtual machines. Each virtual machine is equivalent to a complete operating system and requires an independent kernel, System resources, etc., so the resource consumption of virtual machine technology is relatively large. Container technology creates multiple independent user spaces in the same operating system, and shares the operating system kernel and system resources. Therefore, compared with virtual machine technology, container technology consumes less resources and is lighter. 2. Virtual machine technology can run different operating systems to achieve multi-platform compatibility, but it is more cumbersome than container technology due to the need for independent kernels and system resources. Container technology can only run on the same operating system kernel, but because it shares the same kernel and does not require an additional virtualization layer, containers can start, stop, restart, and upgrade faster, making them more flexible and efficient . 3. The security of virtual machine technology is higher, because each virtual machine has its own operating system kernel and system resources, which are isolated and independent from each other. The isolation of container technology is achieved by using the "namespace" and "control group" mechanisms of the Linux kernel. This isolation method is slightly weaker than that of virtual machine technology, but it is sufficient to ensure security needs in practical applications. . To sum up, container technology is a more lightweight, efficient, and flexible virtualization technology that can achieve multiple advantages such as cross-platform, portability, and security. Therefore, it has been widely used in Internet application development and operation and maintenance. .
