User: I have to deploy some Web Services on a server that only supports the Java ones, but some of them will be done using perl or python. I want to know if is possible to develop a Java wrapper to call a specific code written in perl or python. So, I want to have all the Web Services in Java, but some of them will call some code using other languages.
Thanks in advance.

Ukrania
Assistant: This depends heavily upon your needs.  If Jython is an option for the Python code (it isn't always 100% compatible), then it is probably the best option there.  Otherwise, you will need to use Java's Process Builder to call the interpretters directly and return the results on their output stream.  This will not be fast (but then again, Jython isn't that fast either, relative to regular Java code), but it is an extremely flexible solution.
