##### Issue Type: Bug Report
##### Ansible Version: ansible-playbook 1.5
##### Environment: OSX, Debian Squeeze
##### Summary:
Imagine a playbook, with a play that has a hosts: line of localhost
Imagine running this playbook, with a --limit derp, which does not include
localhost.
You'd expect this to skip the play with no matching hosts, but instead the
play will get executed, and then the playbook will immediately fail with
FATAL: all hosts have already failed.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
test.yaml
    ---
    - name: Test play 1
      hosts: localhost
      gather_facts: no
      tasks:
        - name: derp
          debug: msg="herp"
    $ ansible-playbook -i derp, test.yaml -vv --limit derp
##### Expected Results:
    PLAY [Test play 1] ************************************************************
    skipping: no hosts matched
or
    TASK: [derp] ******************************************************************
    ok: [localhost] => {
        "msg": "herp"
    }
##### Actual Results:
    TASK: [derp] ******************************************************************
    ok: [localhost] => {
        "msg": "herp"
    }
    FATAL: all hosts have already failed -- aborting
Through some bisecting, I think the offending commit is  
`ae9843f`  
but I'm not positive. I believe it's a combination of this commit, along with
the introduction of the implicit localhost inventory entry. More testing to
continue, but I wanted to get this filed for tracking.
