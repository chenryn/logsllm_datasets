User: I need to run a task every hour on the hour (00:00, 01:00, 02:00, ..., 23:00) every day of the week, but can't seem to find an example in App Engine's docs of how to do this.
There is an example of running at ask every hour, but this doesn't fit because the "start" of that hour depends on when you deploy the application. That is, if I deploy at 4:37 PM, the cron scripts will get executed at 5:37, 6:37, ... instead of 5:00, 6:00, ...
So far the only way that looks like it would work is to have 24 different cron entries, one for the specific hour of each day set to run each day at that specific time. 
Does anyone know of anything that would let me use a schedule like "every hour at :00" or even "every day 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00"?
Assistant: Looking over the docs, I agree that your 24 cron entry idea is the only documented way that would work.  Not ideal, but should work.
