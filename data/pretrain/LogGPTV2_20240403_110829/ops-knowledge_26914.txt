User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Someone is trying to brute-force(?) my private mail server... very... slowly... and with changing IPs This has been going on for about 1-2 days now:

There is one single failed login attempt every 1-2 hours, always from the same domain, but every time from a different IP address. Thus, it won't trigger fail2ban and the logcheck messages are starting to annoy me. :-)

My questions:


What's the point of this kind of "attack"? The rate is much too slow to do any efficient brute-forcing, and I really doubt that someone would specifically target my tiny personal server.
Is there anything I can do against it except banning that provider's complete IP range? I could just stop worrying and add those messages to my logcheck ignore config (since my passwords are strong), but that might cause me to miss more serious attacks.

Assistant: What's the point of this kind of &quot;attack&quot;? The rate is much too slow to do any efficient brute-forcing, and I really doubt that someone would specifically target my tiny personal server.

You may be seeing connections very rarely, but how do you know the bots doing the brute forcing aren't constantly saturating their uplinks, and your site is just one of many being attacked? There is no advantage for an attacker to spend a short time going after one site at a time (and triggering fail2ban), compared to attacking a huge number of servers at once, where each server only sees infrequent connections. Both can have the same total rate of outgoing authentication attempts per second, but attacking one site at a time is simply a less efficient use of the attacker's bandwidth.

Is there anything I can do against it except banning that provider's complete IP range (or ignoring the messages, since my passwords are strong)?

No, not really. Chances are, these are coming from a botnet or a cluster of low-cost VPSes. It is not possible to determine what other IP ranges may be being used just by seeing a few of these. If they are not on the same subnet, they cannot be predicted. You can safely ignore these connections. It is nothing more than the background noise of the internet. Just make sure you aren't low-hanging fruit.
