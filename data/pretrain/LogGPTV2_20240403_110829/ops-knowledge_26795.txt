**User:**
I would like to install the imutils 0.2 package for Python on my Windows 7 operating system. I have only found a .gz file and need guidance on how to use it. Alternatively, if there are any .exe files available, please let me know.

**Assistant:**
Unfortunately, `conda install imutils` is not available for Python 3 on Windows. You can use the following command to install the latest version of imutils via pip:

```sh
pip3 install imutils
```

If you specifically need version 0.2, you can install it using the following command:

```sh
pip3 install imutils==0.2
```

If you have already downloaded the .gz file, you can install it manually by following these steps:

1. Extract the .gz file using a tool like 7-Zip or WinZip.
2. Navigate to the extracted directory in your command prompt.
3. Run the following command to install the package:

   ```sh
   python setup.py install
   ```

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to install packages on your system. If you encounter any issues, consider running the command prompt as an administrator.

This version provides clear instructions and addresses both the installation via pip and the manual installation from a .gz file.
