Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-comment-your-
javascript-code has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include
links to screenshots if possible.
When running the test on a multiple line comment such as:
/*  
comment  
*/
the code does not pass. /* comments _/ are usually used when you want to span
a comment across multiple lines, this would be a great area to talk about the
difference between the two. To fix the bug you could add your regex expression
to check continuous lines for the /_ */ comment
