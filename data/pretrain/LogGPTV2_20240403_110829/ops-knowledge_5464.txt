**User:**
I would like to use Google App Engine's full-text search to find items in an index where the `logo` field is set to `None`. I have tried using the query `"NOT logo_url:''"`, but it did not work. Is there a way to write such a query, or do I need to add another property, such as `has_logo`, to achieve this?

**Assistant:**
Have you tried using the following query instead?

```
NOT logo_url: Null
```

This should help you filter out items where the `logo_url` is `Null` (or `None`). If this does not work, adding a boolean property like `has_logo` might be a more reliable solution.
