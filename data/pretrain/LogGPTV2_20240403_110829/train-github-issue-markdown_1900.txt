Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-build-web-apps-with-
expressjs has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include links
to screenshots if possible.
Steps 18 & 19 on this way point:
"session & cookie" and JSON Me are not in the current expressworks steps.
I'd recommend updating the description to simply have the student complete all
the steps. PARAM PAM PAM for example, seems like a very useful exercise for
the basejumps, but it's not included in the way point steps.
