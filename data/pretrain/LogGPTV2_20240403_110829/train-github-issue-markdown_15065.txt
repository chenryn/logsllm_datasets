I have been attempting to run my Flutter application in TestFlight mode on iOS. The app functions correctly in development and when I switch the scheme to "Release." However, once it is published to TestFlight, the screen displays as a blank white page. I am unable to determine the cause of this issue.

Here are the details of my current setup:

      brew install --HEAD usbmuxd
      brew unlink usbmuxd
      brew link usbmuxd
      brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice
      brew install ideviceinstaller
      ```
  - `ios-deploy` version: 1.9.2
    - Warning: `ios-deploy` is out of date (1.9.4 is required). To upgrade with Homebrew:

**Summary:**
- Flutter Doctor found issues in 1 category, specifically related to the iOS toolchain and the need to update `ios-deploy` and possibly `libimobiledevice` and `ideviceinstaller`.

If you have any suggestions or insights into why the app is displaying a blank white screen in TestFlight, I would greatly appreciate your help.
