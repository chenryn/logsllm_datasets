User: I am trying to simulate a a network consisting of several clients and servers. I have written node.py which contains client-server code. I want to run multiple instances node.py. But I don't want to do it manually so I have written another file spawn.py which spawns multiple instances of node.py using fork and exec. However, I need to run each instance of node.py on different terminal(shell) so that I can easily debug what is happening inside each node. 
How can we do that? Please help.  
EDIT : I am working on linux and using python 2.5 and 
       I want to run all processes on the same box
Assistant: If you want "real" (pseudo-;-) terminals, and are using X11 (almost every GUI interface on Linux does;-), you could exec xterm -e python node.py instead of just python node.py -- substitute for xterm whatever terminal emulator program you prefer, of course (I'm sure they all have command-line switches equivalent to good old xterm's -e, to specify what program they should run!-).
