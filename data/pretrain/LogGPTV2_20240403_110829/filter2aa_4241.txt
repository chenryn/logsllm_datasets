# Crazy Circuit Conundrum, re: 161p

We are attempting to gain access to a secure storage area. After exposing the panel of the lock mechanism, we discovered a circuit board. Please proceed to the organizers' table and attempt to unlock the entry to the storage.

The organizers provided us with a circuit board that includes 16 DIP switches, several discrete logic chips, and a few LEDs. Our goal is to find the correct combination of switch settings to illuminate the LED, indicating that the lock has been successfully bypassed. We have taken photographs of both sides of the circuit board, aligned them using GIMP, and manually traced and labeled each signal for further analysis.
