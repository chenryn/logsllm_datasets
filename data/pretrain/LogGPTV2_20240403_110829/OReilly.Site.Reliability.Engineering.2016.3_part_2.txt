### Foreword

Google's story is a narrative of scaling up, marking a significant shift towards IT-centric business. Google was among the first companies to define business-IT alignment and played a crucial role in shaping the concept of DevOps for the broader IT community. This book is written by a diverse group of individuals who were instrumental in this transition.

During Google's growth, the traditional role of system administrators was being redefined. The company challenged conventional system administration, emphasizing the need for new thinking and rapid adaptation. Initially, the role of Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) was fiercely secretive, but over time, information and methods have been shared more openly. This book showcases the willingness to share SRE thinking and practices.

The essays in this book provide personal accounts and insights, written with intellectual honesty and a variety of perspectives. They offer valuable lessons and reflections on the challenges and successes of building and maintaining large-scale systems. The existence of this book is a testament to Google's commitment to sharing knowledge and experiences, which can inspire and inform others in the industry.

### Preface

Software engineering shares a commonality with raising children: the effort and challenges continue well beyond the initial development phase. Despite this, the industry often focuses more on the design and build stages rather than the operational lifecycle. The discipline that addresses the full lifecycle of software, from inception to decommissioning, is what Google calls Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).

SREs are engineers who apply computer science and engineering principles to the design and operation of large distributed systems. Their primary focus is on reliability, ensuring that systems are scalable, efficient, and robust. However, they also balance this with adding new features and building new products when systems are "reliable enough."

SREs operate services built on distributed computing systems, ranging from internal infrastructure to external products like the Google Cloud Platform. Although SRE originated at Google, its principles and practices can be applied to other organizations. This book aims to share these principles and practices, providing general guidelines and specific examples to help other organizations improve their reliability and operational efficiency.

We have included contextual material to help readers understand and apply the concepts discussed. Smaller organizations can benefit from incorporating lightweight reliability practices early on, as it is less costly to expand such structures later. Part IV of the book provides best practices for training, communication, and meetings that can be immediately useful.

For those already engaged in SRE-like work, recognizing and fostering this role can lead to significant improvements in reliability. The historical example of Margaret Hamilton, who worked on the Apollo program, highlights the importance of thoroughness, preparation, and documentation in preventing and mitigating issues.
