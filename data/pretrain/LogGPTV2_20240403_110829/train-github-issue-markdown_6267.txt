Reproduce:
  * open a file
  * edit a file
  * close tab (`Ctrl-F4` on Windows)
  * press `N`
The "Save / Cancel / Don't save" dialog should respond to key-presses of `Y`
and `N` since it's conceptially posing for a Yes/No/Cancel dialog. Perhaps `S`
and `D` if you disagree, but if there's no way to control this dialog with the
keyboard, that's bad.
(To be pedantic: Windows introduced a few version ago that by pressing `Alt`
the letters that respond to `Alt`-combinations show underlined. It may be a
flavour, but one one grows accustomed to.)
