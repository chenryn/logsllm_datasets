**Description**
I'm trying to add a reference from the root:
    import {Hero} from "/models/hero";
But it only works if I add both `models` and `/models` to the rootDirs array:
tsconfig.json
        "rootDirs": [
          "models",
          "/models"
        ]
If I only use one (either one) I get `error TS2307: Cannot find module
'/models/hero'`
Seems odd that I need both for it to work.
