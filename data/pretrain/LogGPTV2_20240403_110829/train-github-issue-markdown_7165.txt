I encountered an issue where the page only displays "Loading." While it functions correctly in Chrome, I experienced problems when testing your live sample on both Internet Explorer 11 and Safari on Windows 10. Upon clicking the live sample, I was directed to GitHub, and the Angular 2 TypeScript example did not work. Additionally, when I imported your code into Visual Studio 2015 and tested the sample, the same problem persisted as on your website. 

However, when I used the JavaScript version instead of the TypeScript version in Visual Studio 2015, it worked across all browsers. Could you please address this issue with the TypeScript example?
