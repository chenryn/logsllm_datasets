It shows only "Loading". It works on Chrome. I just clicked on your live
sample and was linked to github and your angular2 typescript example not
working on internet explorer 11 and safari on windows 10. When I put your code
in visual studio 2015 and tested the sample, it is the same problem like on
your website. Please fix!!! However when I use your Java script instead of
typescript version on visual studio 2015, it works on all browsers.
