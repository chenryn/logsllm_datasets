ABSTRACT
Online advertising can be used to mislead, deceive, and manipulate
Internet users, and political advertising is no exception. In this pa-
per, we present a measurement study of online advertising around
the 2020 United States elections, with a focus on identifying dark
patterns and other potentially problematic content in political adver-
tising. We scraped ad content on 745 news and media websites from
six geographic locations in the U.S. from September 2020 to January
2021, collecting 1.4 million ads. We perform a systematic qualitative
analysis of political content in these ads, as well as a quantitative
analysis of the distribution of political ads on different types of
websites. Our findings reveal the widespread use of problematic
tactics in political ads, such as bait-and-switch ads formatted as
opinion polls to entice users to click, the use of political controversy
by content farms for clickbait, and the more frequent occurrence
of political ads on highly partisan news websites. We make policy
recommendations for online political advertising, including greater
scrutiny of non-official political ads and comprehensive standards
across advertising platforms.

1 INTRODUCTION
The 2020 United States general elections were among the most
important and contentious elections in recent history. Issues facing
the U.S. included the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing economic
crisis, controversy surrounding President Donald Trump’s first
term, and renewed movement for racial justice following the murder
of George Floyd and other police violence. During this election
season, online political advertising was more prominent than ever:
campaigns turned to online ads as the pandemic reduced in-person

events and canvassing [89], and spent record sums advertising on
Google and Facebook [69]. The misuse of online ads in non-political
contexts is a well-known problem, ranging from distasteful clickbait
ads to outright scams and malware [47, 58, 95–97]. In this paper, we
investigate misleading and manipulative tactics in online political
advertising, for purposes such as collecting email addresses and
driving traffic to political content websites.
We take a broad view of what constitutes a “political” ad in our
work, considering any ad with political content, whether or not
the ad was placed by an official political campaign committee. In
our investigation, we ask: Who ran political ads during this period?
What was the content of these ads, and do they use problematic
techniques? Did the number of political ads on different types of
websites differ?
To answer these questions, we conducted measurements of on-
line advertising before, during, and after the Nov. 3rd elections. We
collected a daily crawler-based sample of ads from 745 online news
and media websites from September 2020 to January 2021, provid-
ing insight into the ads people saw while reading news during this
period. We continued collecting data through several post-election
developments: contested vote counting in multiple states, the Geor-
gia U.S. Senate runoff election on January 5, and the attack on the
U.S. Capitol on January 6. Our crawlers collected data from six
locations with varying political contestation: Atlanta, GA; Miami,
FL; Raleigh, NC; Phoenix, AZ; Salt Lake City, UT; and Seattle, WA.
Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques,
we analyze the political ads in our dataset, including identifying
examples of misleading and manipulative techniques, the distribu-
tion of political ads across websites of different political biases, and
political affiliations and organization types of the advertisers.
Scope. Our crawler-based dataset provides a complementary per-
spective to the political ad archives from Google and Facebook.
Though our dataset is not as complete as the political ad archives,
and partially overlaps Google’s, our dataset encompasses all ads
on the pages we crawled — including non-political ads, political-
themed ads were not officially classified as political and thus do not
appear in Google’s archive, and ads served via ad networks outside
of Google Ads. Additionally, we capture the URL of the website that
each ad appeared on, allowing us to measure contextual targeting
of political ads on news and media websites.
Contributions. First, we characterize the quantity and content of
online advertising longitudinally during the 2020 U.S. Presidential
Election and shortly thereafter, and at scale.

we collected during this time period.
Through our qualitative analysis, we observed several problem-
atic types of online political advertising, such as:
• The use of misleading and manipulative patterns in political
ads. For example, ads that purport to be political polls, but use
inflammatory framing, and appear to be used for gathering
email addresses.
• Political topics in clickbait and native advertising. These ads
imitate the look of links to news articles, but link to external
sites. Headlines often imply controversy about candidates,
and may fuel disinformation.
We also find that problematic political ads are more common on
partisan and low-quality news sites.
• More partisan websites have more political ads, on both ends

We discuss the potential harms from the problematic political ads
we observed, and we make recommendations for platform policies,
government regulation, and future research. We also release our
full dataset of ads and metadata.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 The 2020-21 U.S. Elections and Ads
Between September 2020 and January 2021, the U.S. held a presi-
dential election, congressional elections, and numerous state and
local elections. In the presidential election, Joe Biden, a Democrat,
and his running mate, Kamala Harris, ran against Donald Trump,
the incumbent Republican president, and his running mate, Mike
Pence [8]. We provide more historical background in Appendix A.
Before the election, tech companies faced mounting pressure to
address concerns about political advertising spreading misinforma-
tion and causing other harms. Some companies had already banned
political ads (Pinterest in 2018 [31], Twitter in 2019 [17]), at least in
part due to revelations that Russian organizations had purchased
political ads during the 2016 presidential election [41]. Google and
Facebook allowed political ads in 2020, but implemented several
short-term bans. Our dataset of display ads was likely impacted by
Google’s bans from Nov. 4 through Dec. 10 [25, 78], and again after
the storming of the Capitol between Jan. 14 and Feb. 24 [26].
Still, political ads around the 2020-21 elections set new records
for ad spending, with overall spending in the billions. On Facebook
and Google alone, the Trump campaign spent $276 million and the
Biden campaign spent $213 million [69].
2.2 Online Political and Problematic Ads
Prior work studies the online ad ecosystem from various perspec-
tives. In the computer security and privacy community, researchers
have often studied the privacy implications of online ads and the
tracking enabling them (e.g., [9, 45, 59, 71, 75, 90]). In this work,
we focus on the content of ads and contextual targeting that may
cause different ads to appear on different types of sites, rather than
on the underlying privacy-invasive mechanisms.
Recent work in computer science identifies types of problematic
content in ads (e.g., clickbait, distasteful ads, misleading content,
manipulative techniques) [96, 97], and types explicitly malicious ads
(e.g., spreading malware) [47, 58, 67, 93, 95]. Online ads play a role
in spreading mis/disinformation (e.g., during the 2016 and 2018 U.S.
elections) [14, 21, 79, 80] as well as in monetizing mis/disinforma-
tion websites [15, 27, 40, 60]. Other work has shown that ads (e.g., on
Facebook) may be targeted in discriminatory ways [2, 43]. Studies of
misleading and manipulative patterns (often called “dark patterns”)
beyond ads also inform our work (e.g., [51, 57]), particularly a recent
study of such patterns in political campaign emails [52].
Significant work in other fields (e.g., political science and mar-
keting) also studies political ads. Kim et al. identified political ads
on Facebook purchased by “suspicious” groups, including Russian
groups known for spreading disinformation [41]. Stromer-Galley
et al. [85] studied U.S. political ads on Facebook in 2016 and 2020,
while Ballard et al. [7] characterized political campaign web display
ads during the 2012 U.S. elections. Other work considered deceptive
political advertising, (not necessarily online) including deceptively
formatted “native” ads (e.g., [18, 55]). Van Steenburg provides a
systematic literature review of political advertising research and
proposes a research agenda, identifying the study of the impact of
technology (i.e., the internet) as one key theme and area for future
work (but does not discuss the manipulative patterns or non-official
political ads that we see in our dataset) [84].
Our work considers ads appearing on websites rather than social
media, and we capture all ads (not only those marked as political
ads). Prior work has found that Facebook’s ad archives are incom-
plete and use a limited definition of “political” [20, 21, 81]. Indeed,
we found many ads that contained political themes but were not
placed by an official campaign.
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we describe our methodology for measuring ads
throughout the 2020 U.S. elections. In summary, we selected a group
of popular mainstream and alternative news websites and scraped
ads from these sites using crawlers in different locations. We col-
lected 1.4 million ads in total from September 2020 to January 2021.
We analyzed the content of our ads dataset using a combination
of natural language processing, to automate tasks like identifying
which ads were political, and manual qualitative analysis tech-
niques, to provide greater context such as the party affiliation of
the advertiser. See Figure 1 for a summary of our analysis pipeline.
3.1 Ad Crawling
Seed Websites. To collect ads, we crawled news and me-
3.1.1
dia websites that spanned the political spectrum and information
ecosystem. We identified 6,144 mainstream news websites in the
Tranco Top 1 million [44], using categories provided by the Alexa
Web Information Service [4]. These mainstream sites included na-
tional newspapers, local newspapers, TV stations, and online digital
media. We also compiled a list of 1,344 websites which we refer to
as “misinformation websites”. Websites in this list were identified as

Table 1: Summary of our seed sites, by misinformation label
and political bias (sources in Section 3.1.1).
“fake news”, alternative news, mis/disinformation, highly partisan,
propaganda, or conspiracy websites by fact checkers (Politifact [83],
Snopes [42], Media Bias/Fact Check [54], and others [23, 36, 61]).
To ensure that our crawlers could complete the crawl list in one
day, we truncated the list to 745 sites by picking all sites with a
ranking higher than 5,000 (411 sites), and then sampling from the
remaining tail (334 sites) by choosing 1 site per bucket of 10,000
site rank, to ensure that lower ranked sites were represented. In
Table 1, we show the number of sites in our crawl list by misinfor-
mation label and political bias. The political bias of websites were
aggregated from Media Bias/Fact Check [54] and AllSides [3].
3.1.2 Crawler Implementation. We built a web crawler to scrape
ads based on Puppeteer [28], a Chromium-based browser automa-
tion library. Each crawler node crawls the seed list once per day,
crawling 6 domains in parallel in random order. For each seed do-
main, the crawler loads the root page and detects ads using CSS
selectors from EasyList [19], a filter list used by ad blockers. Ele-
ments smaller than 10 pixels in width or height (like tracking pixels)
were ignored. The crawler scrolls to each ad, takes a screenshot,
and collects the HTML content. Then, the crawler clicks the ad,
and collects the URL and content of the landing page. Because ads
may differ on site homepage vs. subpages, for each seed domain,
the crawler also visits and collects ads from an article on the site.
To minimize behavioral ad targeting, we crawled each seed do-
main using a clean browser profile (similar to prior work [96]). For
each domain we visited, we ran separate browser instances inside
a new Docker container, so that no tracking cookies or other state
persisted across domains (though fingerprinting may be possible).
3.1.3 Crawler Nodes and Locations. We crawled ads using 4 nodes
from geographical locations where we predicted the political land-
scape could result in different ads.
