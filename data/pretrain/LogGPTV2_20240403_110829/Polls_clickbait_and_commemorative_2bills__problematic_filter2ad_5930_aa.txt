## Abstract
Online advertising can be used to mislead, deceive, and manipulate internet users, and political advertising is no exception. In this paper, we present a measurement study of online advertising around the 2020 United States elections, with a focus on identifying dark patterns and other potentially problematic content in political advertising. We scraped ad content from 745 news and media websites across six geographic locations in the U.S. from September 2020 to January 2021, collecting 1.4 million ads. We performed a systematic qualitative analysis of political content in these ads, as well as a quantitative analysis of the distribution of political ads on different types of websites. Our findings reveal the widespread use of problematic tactics in political ads, such as bait-and-switch ads formatted as opinion polls to entice users to click, the use of political controversy by content farms for clickbait, and the more frequent occurrence of political ads on highly partisan news websites. We make policy recommendations for online political advertising, including greater scrutiny of non-official political ads and comprehensive standards across advertising platforms.

## 1. Introduction
The 2020 United States general elections were among the most important and contentious in recent history. Issues facing the U.S. included the COVID-19 pandemic, economic crisis, controversy surrounding President Donald Trump’s first term, and renewed movement for racial justice following the murder of George Floyd and other instances of police violence. During this election season, online political advertising was more prominent than ever, with campaigns turning to online ads as the pandemic reduced in-person events and canvassing [89]. Record sums were spent on Google and Facebook [69]. The misuse of online ads in non-political contexts, ranging from distasteful clickbait to outright scams and malware, is a well-known problem [47, 58, 95–97]. In this paper, we investigate misleading and manipulative tactics in online political advertising, such as collecting email addresses and driving traffic to political content websites.

We take a broad view of what constitutes a "political" ad, considering any ad with political content, whether or not it was placed by an official political campaign committee. Our investigation asks: Who ran political ads during this period? What was the content of these ads, and did they use problematic techniques? Did the number of political ads differ across various types of websites?

To answer these questions, we conducted measurements of online advertising before, during, and after the Nov. 3rd elections. We collected a daily crawler-based sample of ads from 745 online news and media websites from September 2020 to January 2021, providing insight into the ads people saw while reading news during this period. We continued collecting data through several post-election developments, including contested vote counting in multiple states, the Georgia U.S. Senate runoff election on January 5, and the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6. Our crawlers collected data from six locations with varying political contestation: Atlanta, GA; Miami, FL; Raleigh, NC; Phoenix, AZ; Salt Lake City, UT; and Seattle, WA.

Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques, we analyzed the political ads in our dataset, including identifying examples of misleading and manipulative techniques, the distribution of political ads across websites of different political biases, and the political affiliations and organization types of the advertisers.

### Scope
Our crawler-based dataset provides a complementary perspective to the political ad archives from Google and Facebook. Although our dataset is not as complete as the political ad archives and partially overlaps with Google’s, it encompasses all ads on the pages we crawled, including non-political ads, political-themed ads not officially classified as political, and ads served via ad networks outside of Google Ads. Additionally, we captured the URL of the website where each ad appeared, allowing us to measure contextual targeting of political ads on news and media websites.

### Contributions
- We characterized the quantity and content of online advertising longitudinally during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election and shortly thereafter, at scale.
- We observed differences in the number of political ads across different geographical locations.
- We observed shifts in the quantity of political ads through the election and the effects of political ad bans.
- Through our qualitative analysis, we observed several problematic types of online political advertising, such as:
  - The use of misleading and manipulative patterns in political ads, e.g., ads that purport to be political polls but use inflammatory framing and appear to be used for gathering email addresses.
  - Political topics in clickbait and native advertising, which imitate the look of links to news articles but link to external sites. Headlines often imply controversy about candidates and may fuel disinformation.
- We found that problematic political ads are more common on partisan and low-quality news sites.
- More partisan websites have more political ads, on both ends of the political spectrum.
- Problematic categories of ads, such as political products and polls, appear more frequently on right-leaning sites.

We discuss the potential harms from the problematic political ads we observed and make recommendations for platform policies, government regulation, and future research. We also release our full dataset of ads and metadata.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 The 2020-21 U.S. Elections and Ads
Between September 2020 and January 2021, the U.S. held a presidential election, congressional elections, and numerous state and local elections. In the presidential election, Joe Biden, a Democrat, and his running mate, Kamala Harris, ran against Donald Trump, the incumbent Republican president, and his running mate, Mike Pence [8]. We provide more historical background in Appendix A.

Before the election, tech companies faced mounting pressure to address concerns about political advertising spreading misinformation and causing other harms. Some companies had already banned political ads (Pinterest in 2018 [31], Twitter in 2019 [17]), at least in part due to revelations that Russian organizations had purchased political ads during the 2016 presidential election [41]. Google and Facebook allowed political ads in 2020 but implemented several short-term bans. Our dataset of display ads was likely impacted by Google’s bans from Nov. 4 through Dec. 10 [25, 78], and again after the storming of the Capitol between Jan. 14 and Feb. 24 [26].

Still, political ads around the 2020-21 elections set new records for ad spending, with overall spending in the billions. On Facebook and Google alone, the Trump campaign spent $276 million, and the Biden campaign spent $213 million [69].

### 2.2 Online Political and Problematic Ads
Prior work studies the online ad ecosystem from various perspectives. In the computer security and privacy community, researchers have often studied the privacy implications of online ads and the tracking enabling them (e.g., [9, 45, 59, 71, 75, 90]). In this work, we focus on the content of ads and contextual targeting that may cause different ads to appear on different types of sites, rather than on the underlying privacy-invasive mechanisms.

Recent work in computer science identifies types of problematic content in ads (e.g., clickbait, distasteful ads, misleading content, manipulative techniques) [96, 97] and types of explicitly malicious ads (e.g., spreading malware) [47, 58, 67, 93, 95]. Online ads play a role in spreading mis/disinformation (e.g., during the 2016 and 2018 U.S. elections) [14, 21, 79, 80] and in monetizing mis/disinformation websites [15, 27, 40, 60]. Other work has shown that ads (e.g., on Facebook) may be targeted in discriminatory ways [2, 43]. Studies of misleading and manipulative patterns (often called “dark patterns”) beyond ads also inform our work (e.g., [51, 57]), particularly a recent study of such patterns in political campaign emails [52].

Significant work in other fields (e.g., political science and marketing) also studies political ads. Kim et al. identified political ads on Facebook purchased by “suspicious” groups, including Russian groups known for spreading disinformation [41]. Stromer-Galley et al. [85] studied U.S. political ads on Facebook in 2016 and 2020, while Ballard et al. [7] characterized political campaign web display ads during the 2012 U.S. elections. Other work considered deceptive political advertising, (not necessarily online) including deceptively formatted “native” ads (e.g., [18, 55]). Van Steenburg provides a systematic literature review of political advertising research and proposes a research agenda, identifying the study of the impact of technology (i.e., the internet) as one key theme and area for future work (but does not discuss the manipulative patterns or non-official political ads that we see in our dataset) [84].

Our work considers ads appearing on websites rather than social media, and we capture all ads (not only those marked as political ads). Prior work has found that Facebook’s ad archives are incomplete and use a limited definition of “political” [20, 21, 81]. Indeed, we found many ads that contained political themes but were not placed by an official campaign.

## 3. Methodology
In this section, we describe our methodology for measuring ads throughout the 2020 U.S. elections. In summary, we selected a group of popular mainstream and alternative news websites and scraped ads from these sites using crawlers in different locations. We collected 1.4 million ads in total from September 2020 to January 2021. We analyzed the content of our ads dataset using a combination of natural language processing, to automate tasks like identifying which ads were political, and manual qualitative analysis techniques, to provide greater context such as the party affiliation of the advertiser. See Figure 1 for a summary of our analysis pipeline.

### 3.1 Ad Crawling
#### 3.1.1 Seed Websites
To collect ads, we crawled news and media websites that spanned the political spectrum and information ecosystem. We identified 6,144 mainstream news websites in the Tranco Top 1 million [44], using categories provided by the Alexa Web Information Service [4]. These mainstream sites included national newspapers, local newspapers, TV stations, and online digital media. We also compiled a list of 1,344 websites which we refer to as “misinformation websites.” Websites in this list were identified as “fake news,” alternative news, mis/disinformation, highly partisan, propaganda, or conspiracy websites by fact checkers (Politifact [83], Snopes [42], Media Bias/Fact Check [54], and others [23, 36, 61]).

To ensure that our crawlers could complete the crawl list in one day, we truncated the list to 745 sites by picking all sites with a ranking higher than 5,000 (411 sites), and then sampling from the remaining tail (334 sites) by choosing 1 site per bucket of 10,000 site rank, to ensure that lower-ranked sites were represented. In Table 1, we show the number of sites in our crawl list by misinformation label and political bias. The political bias of websites was aggregated from Media Bias/Fact Check [54] and AllSides [3].

#### 3.1.2 Crawler Implementation
We built a web crawler to scrape ads based on Puppeteer [28], a Chromium-based browser automation library. Each crawler node crawls the seed list once per day, crawling 6 domains in parallel in random order. For each seed domain, the crawler loads the root page and detects ads using CSS selectors from EasyList [19], a filter list used by ad blockers. Elements smaller than 10 pixels in width or height (like tracking pixels) were ignored. The crawler scrolls to each ad, takes a screenshot, and collects the HTML content. Then, the crawler clicks the ad and collects the URL and content of the landing page. Because ads may differ on the site homepage vs. subpages, for each seed domain, the crawler also visits and collects ads from an article on the site.

To minimize behavioral ad targeting, we crawled each seed domain using a clean browser profile (similar to prior work [96]). For each domain we visited, we ran separate browser instances inside a new Docker container, so that no tracking cookies or other state persisted across domains (though fingerprinting may be possible).

#### 3.1.3 Crawler Nodes and Locations
We crawled ads using 4 nodes from geographical locations where we predicted the political landscape could result in different ads.

- **Sep. 25, 2020 – Nov. 12, 2020**: We first crawled from two cities in states predicted to be contested (Miami, FL; Raleigh, NC).
