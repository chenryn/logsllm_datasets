### Issue Report

#### I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Expected Behavior
There should be an intuitive Multiple Select component that correctly displays the selected items in the popup list. One possible solution could be to use a list with additional checkboxes, similar to the demo provided (click on the struck-through eye icon). Another alternative, as suggested in [this pull request](#), may also be viable, but I prefer the behavior of Single Select components. Therefore, I am opening this issue specifically for Multiple Select components.

## Current Behavior
When creating a `Select` field with the `multiple` option and clicking on it, the first item in the popped-up list is automatically highlighted, even if no selection has been made.

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. Go to the official demo of the multiple `Select` component.
2. Click on the initially empty `Select` field.
3. Observe that the first item in the popped-up list remains highlighted, even if you move the mouse pointer elsewhere.

## Context
This issue affects the user experience, as it can lead to confusion about which items are actually selected.
