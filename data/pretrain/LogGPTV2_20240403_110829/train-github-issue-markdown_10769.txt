## Expected Behavior
There should be an intuitive Multiple Select component that has the correct
items selected in the popup list. Maybe it would be better to use a list with
additional checkboxes in it, something like in this demo (when you click the
struck through eye. An alternative would be like it is solved in this pull
request, but I am not sure if this is the right way, as I like how Single
Select components behave. That`s why I opened an own issue for Multiple Select
components.
## Current Behavior
When creating a Select field with the `multiple` option and then clicking that
initially empty Select field the first item in the popped up list is
automatically highlighted.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Go to the official component demo of the multiple `Select` and click it. The
first item stays the selected in the popped up list even if you move the mouse
pointer elsewhere.
