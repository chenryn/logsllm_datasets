User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Hardening Tor/proxy chain by choosing the relays' countries Tor is in fact just a proxy chain consisting of 3 proxies. A good enough reason to do the paperwork can be enough to deanonymize a user (the link is valid assuming all the relays' ISPs store logs). Thus Tor users' need to worry about their anonymity highly depends on their threat model. (blowing up the WTC is most likely more motivating to do the paperwork than DDoSing your competency's site)

Once, I've read something about making a proxy chain distributed over countries that don't have a good political relationship in some very downvoted (because of the rest of the question) question here. 

But the idea itself is interesting. If you've used Tor and for some reason the US government wants to have a friendly talk with you, using a proxy in countries with bad political relationship with the US, such as Russia, would make the paperwork really hard.

A good example of this US-Russia relationship is the Sci-Hub lawsuit:


  Elsevier claims that Sci-Hub illegally accesses accounts of students
  and academic institutions to provide free access to articles through
  their platform ScienceDirect. The case is complicated by the fact
  that the site is hosted in St. Petersburg, Russia, making it difficult
  to target within the US legal system. [Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub#Lawsuit]




Question (I admit this might be somewhat discussable/subjective): To what extent do the country choices affect users' anonymity (of course assuming you haven't hacked all the nuclear silos)? Is there any known case of paperwork beating a Tor circuit?

Note: I'm talking about knowing the user's Tor IP address only, nothing more. Not confirming their identity, but finding it.

Assistant: ... rather about chaining proxies through countries that don't have a good political relationship to make the paperwork a hard thing.


What paperwork? The nodes only know what other nodes are talking to it.
The way to 'reverse' a Tor connection is either by 


Infecting the PC through Tor like the FBI did
Running / compromising an exit node and looking for identifiable info in the exit traffic
Running time correllation on the infrastructure used for entry and exit


The only paperwork i could imagine is with #3 but you only need to monitor the entry like this so the intermediate nodes don't matter. The likely opponent, state actors, will probably opt for the first two options. Infecting is easier and more reliable than tracing.
