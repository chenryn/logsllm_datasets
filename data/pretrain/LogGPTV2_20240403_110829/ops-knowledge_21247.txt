Question: A developer is attempting to use parameterized SQL to prevent SQL injection in their application. However, they mistakenly wrote the following code snippet: `conn.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", username, password)`. Identify the issues with this approach.
"A": "Using parameterized SQL in this way does not prevent SQL injection, as the parameters are not being used within a prepared statement.",
"B": "The parameters should be enclosed in a tuple or list, otherwise, it can lead to a syntax error or incorrect query execution.",
"C": "The approach is correct; there are no issues with this implementation of parameterized SQL.",
"D": "The use of double quotes for the SQL query string can make the code prone to SQL injection if the programming language interprets it as allowing interpolation."
Answer: B
