The attached code shows the very same behavior as #1225, although I can
confirm that it works with numpy 1.0.3 on the same machine with te same Python
distribution. I used the binary packages from the sourceforge download site
together with Python 2.5.1. I did not install any LAPACK or BLAS packages.
Furthermore it works on openSUSE 10.3 with numpy 1.0.4, libblas3-3.1.1-29,
liblapack3-3.1.1-29 (which may be another hint, that it is no duplicate of
#1225)
