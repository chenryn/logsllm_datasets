The attached code exhibits the same behavior as issue #1225. However, I can confirm that it works correctly with NumPy 1.0.3 on the same machine and with the same Python distribution. I used the binary packages from the SourceForge download site, along with Python 2.5.1, and did not install any LAPACK or BLAS packages.

Additionally, the code runs successfully on openSUSE 10.3 with NumPy 1.0.4, libblas3-3.1.1-29, and liblapack3-3.1.1-29. This suggests that the issue may not be a duplicate of #1225.
