server IP curve.
with UDmap or Dynablock IPs sent spam emails only. The X-axis
corresponds to the spam ratio, computed as the percentage of spam
over the number of mail messages received from per IP per day (re-
ferred to as a session). The Y-axis is the cumulative fraction of the
sessions. Based on the classiﬁcation results using the existing Hot-
mail spam ﬁlter, 95.6% of the sessions from UDmap IPs sent spam
only (spam ratio = 100%), 97.0% of them sent emails with over
90% spam ratio. The remaining 3% can potentially be legitimate
mail servers. We note here, however, the 3% is an upper bound of
our spammer detection false positive rate because the existing spam
ﬁlter might miss spam emails. In contrast, there is a much smaller
fraction of sessions from the likely static IP addresses with a high
spam ratio: 31.4% of the sessions sent only spam, and 62.8% of the
sessions had spam ratio lower than 90%. More importantly, using
the knowledge of dynamic IP addresses, we can ﬁlter 40.3% of the
undetected spam emails – those slipped through the existing spam
ﬁlter, but subsequently reported by users as spam (last column of
Table 6). Thus we expect using UDmap IP can further reduce the
spam ﬁltering false negatives.
We also studied the ASes that sent the most spam emails to Hot-
mail and the results are presented in Table 7. Notice that the top
spamming ASes are spread out across the globe. This ﬁnding dif-
fers from the results reported by Ramachandran et al. [23], which
showed that about 40% of spam originates from the U.S. A pos-
sible explanation is that Hotmail’s global user presence attracts a
broader range of spamming IP addresses worldwide. The third and
fourth columns of the Table 7 present results pertaining spamming
behavior of dynamic IPs in these top ASes. In particular, the third
column indicates that, for majority of the top ASes, over 50% of
their outgoing spam emails originate from dynamic IP ranges. This
suggests that spam from dynamic IP addresses is prevalent across
large, active consumer ASes. The fourth column delivers an even
stronger message: the overwhelmingly high spam ratios from these
(dynamic IP based) spam sources is highly indicative that a large
fraction of them are compromised zombie hosts exploited by the
spammers.
As evidenced by the strong correlation between spammers and
the dynamic portion of the Internet, the knowledge of dynamic IP
addresses and their usage patterns has great potential to help com-
bating spam. We believe systematically investigating how to incor-
porate the knowledge of IP dynamics into existing spam detection
frameworks is a future research direction of critical importance.
8. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
The results in Section 7 provide evidence that IP dynamics can
be a successful weapon in the ﬁght against email spam. Yet there
is room for improvement: it could be the case that legitimate mail
servers are set up using dynamic IP addresses coming from DSL
or cable modem networks. We expect those cases to exhibit dis-
tinctive email-sending patterns and are currently looking at several
possibilities as ongoing work.
As discussed in Section 4.5, UDmap might misclassify certain
teaching clusters (i.e., labs in universities) and library machines as
dynamic IPs. However these machines are typically in the .edu
domain, and based on our veriﬁcation results, they form a relatively
small population (see Table 4). In order to classify these machines
correctly, one can provide additional information to UDmap – for
example, we can augment our framework to include information
such as OS ID and device ﬁngerprinting information [14] to more
precisely characterize IPs.
The length of the input trace might also impact the quality of re-
sults, and we expect that longer traces will lead to better coverage.
A thorough analysis of the relationship between length of trace (du-
ration) and dynamics of IP addresses is an interesting problem and
deserves attention.
From a security standpoint, spammers might wish to thwart the
effectiveness of UDmap by making static IP appear dynamic, or
to evade detection by making dynamic zombie IPs appear as static
ones. UDmap is robust to such attacks. One cannot let a static IP
address appear to be dynamic without controlling a range of con-
secutive IPs. On the other hand, it is even harder to make a dynamic
IP address appear static because one cannot prevent others from ob-
serving the dynamic behavior of its neighboring IPs.

9. CONCLUSIONS
We presented UDmap, a simple, yet powerful method to au-
tomatically uncover dynamic IP addresses and related IP volatil-
ity information. Using Hotmail user-login data, UDmap identiﬁed
around 102 million dynamic IP addresses spanning across 5891
ASes, indicating that the fraction of dynamic IP addresses in the
Internet is signiﬁcant. Our detailed, large-scale IP dynamics study
showed that majority of the identiﬁed IP addresses are owned by
various consumer network ISPs, and hence are likely used by home
user computers or small enterprise hosts. Our ﬁndings also indicate
that IP volatility exhibits a large variation, ranging from several
hours to several days.
We applied IP dynamics information to spam ﬁltering as an ex-
ample application. Using a three-month long Hotmail email server
log, our trace-based study showed that over 95.6% of the mail
servers set up using dynamic IP addresses sent out only spam, with
the total spam volume being 42.2% of all spam received by Hotmail
during the trace period. We view this as a signiﬁcant and important
result with wide implications to the ﬁeld of spam detection.
