User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I distribute 1 application between 2 servers HI

I have an Email Marketing Rails application running on a CentOS QuadCore 16GB RAM server. But currently our webserver is taking too long to respond to requests on rush hours (Mongrel Cluster + Apache ). We monitoring it using ScoutApp ( www.scoutapp.com ).

Scout Alerts 
Maximum Time(3 sec) exceeded on 668 requests
Maximum Time(3 sec) exceeded on 120 requests

I contracted another server Dual Xeon 4GB RAM .

What is the best setup for distributing this application between 2 servers?
I'm thinking about using the SERVER-1 (16GB RAM) with Mysql and Exim and migrate the application to SERVER-2 (4GB RAM) and use it as the WEB SERVER (Mongrel cluster + Apache) only.

Can anyone suggest me a better setup , tips or ideas?

Assistant: ... you should narrow the scope of the topic to "rails" in particular.  (the subject is a bit misleading)  I would highly suggest looking at the logs &amp; trying to identify where the lag is coming from.

There are several reasons why a Rails app would run slow... and most of the time it has nothing to do with the database or the web server itself.  I would look to make sure that caching is NOT disabled. (in development mode caching is disabled by default) Rails gets a lot of performance boosts from the many caching algorithms it has... Additionally, several of the debugging bits that are turned on in development also eat a bit of performance too.

If all is done that can be done... there are several steps into moving towards a "clustered rails environment."   The debugging I suggested earlier can also tell you what you need to scale up.  If you're constantly waiting on the database to respond... then moving the database server off that box &amp; onto it's own... or clustering the database alone might be all you need.  If you find the www server is the one lagging behind... scale up on the web server.
