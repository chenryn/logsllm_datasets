User: I'm testing some python code that parses command line input. Is there a way to pass this input in through IDLE? Currently I'm saving in the IDLE editor and running from a command prompt.
I'm running Windows.
Assistant: Visual Studio 2015 has an addon for Python. You can supply arguments with that. VS 2015 is now free.
