Subject: Assistance Required for Plone 4.0.5 Installation on Ubuntu 11.04

Dear Support Team,

I am new to Plone and am currently attempting to install Plone 4.0.5 on an Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty) system using the Unified Installer. After unpacking the installer and executing `./install.sh zeo` as root, I encountered the following error message:

```
ZEO Cluster Install selected
Detailed installation log being written to /tmp/Plone-4.0.5-UnifiedInstaller/install.log
Root install method chosen. Will install for use by system user plone
Installing Plone 4.0.5 at /usr/local/Plone
User 'plone' already exists. No need to create it.
Skipping libjpeg build

Installing Python 2.6.6. This takes a while...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
LookupError: unknown encoding: zip
Python zlib support is missing; something went wrong in the zlib or python build.
Installation has failed.
See the detailed installation log at /tmp/Plone-4.0.5-UnifiedInstaller/install.log to determine the cause.
```

In an attempt to resolve this, I have installed the following Ubuntu packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev zlibc libghc6-zlib-dev zlibc
```

However, the issue persists. Upon reviewing the installation log, which is quite extensive, I noticed several mentions of zlib-related issues. Here are some relevant excerpts from the log:

```

```

Interestingly, I could not locate a `setup.py` file within the installation directory. Could you please advise me on how to proceed or what specific items I should be checking? 

Additionally, I noted a suggestion that if a suitable version of Python (e.g., 2.6) is available on my system, I could specify its path using the `--with-python=/path/to/Python-2.6` option when running `install.sh`. However, I am uncertain about the exact steps to follow.

Thank you very much for your assistance.

Best regards,
