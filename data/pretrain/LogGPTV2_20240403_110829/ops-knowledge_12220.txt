User: I am a Python beginner and I am having trouble running Python from CMD. I have added the Python installation directory as a PATH variable (;C:\Python27). I am able to run the Python Interpreter from CMD, however when I issue a command like "python file.py command" from CMD, it returns "Error2, Python can't open, no such file/directory". 
So what I do is go to "cd C:\Folder\Folder2\My_Python_Files", then type the "file.py command" each and every time. Is there faster or more efficient way of doing this? I am currently running Python2.7 on Windows 8.
Assistant: Unless the project's folder is in the PATH, you cannot call the file unless you are inside the project's folder. Don't create PATHs for projects, unless they are needed; it's unnecessary.   
    Just transverse to the file's directory and run the command inside the directory. That will work.  
    If the project will be used by other projects/files, you can use PYTHONPATH to set the directory, so the other projects can successfully access it.
 
   Hope that helps.
