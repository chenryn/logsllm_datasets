User: I am writing a python/pygtk application that is adding some custom scripts (bash) in a certain folder in $HOME (eg. ~/.custom_scripts). 
I want to make that folder available in $PATH. So every time the python app is adding the script, that script could be instantly available when the user is opening a terminal (eg. gnome-terminal). 
Where do you suggest to "inject" that $PATH dependecy ? .bashrc, /etc/profile.d, etc. ?
What advantages / disadvantages I might encounter ?
For example if i add a script to export the new path in /etc/profile.d, the path is not being updated until I re-login.
Thanks
Assistant: For scripts that go in the $HOME directory you'd typically use $HOME/bin folder instead which is (usually) on the path.
