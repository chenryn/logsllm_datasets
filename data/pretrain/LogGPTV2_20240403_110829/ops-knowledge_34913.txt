User: I have quite a few years experience of developing PHP web applications, and have recently started to delve into Python as well. Recently I've been interested in getting into desktop applications as well, but have absolutely no experience in that area. I've seen very little written about PHP-gtk and wonder whether it's really a good area to get stuck in to.
What I'm really looking for is something that will allow me to quite quickly develop some decent small/medium sized apps, and be able to deploy them in Linux and Windows. Something in Python or PHP would be great (but I'd be happy to learn something else if it has big advantages).
What do you guys recommend?
Thanks
Assistant: Why would you like to develop a desktop app in php??
Get yourself a descent programming environment (c/java/c#/) instead of abusing php
especially with c# and java you get pretty quick very nice results. And both are cross platform (although java is easier for cross platform stuff).
C(++) in combination with QT or GTK is also possible, but there the results appear slower
