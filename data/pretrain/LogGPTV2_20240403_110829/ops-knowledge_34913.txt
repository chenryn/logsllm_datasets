I have several years of experience developing PHP web applications and have recently started exploring Python as well. Lately, I've become interested in desktop application development, but I have no prior experience in this area. I've noticed that there is limited information available about PHP-GTK and am unsure if it is a worthwhile technology to invest my time in.

My goal is to find a solution that allows me to quickly develop and deploy small to medium-sized desktop applications on both Linux and Windows. While I would prefer to use Python or PHP, I am open to learning a new language if it offers significant advantages.

What do you recommend?

It's great to hear that you are expanding your skills into desktop application development. While PHP is primarily used for web applications, it can be used for desktop applications with frameworks like PHP-GTK, though this is not as common or well-supported as other options.

For desktop application development, you might want to consider more established and versatile languages and frameworks. Here are a few recommendations:

1. **Python**:
   - **PyQt** or **PySide**: These are powerful and widely-used libraries for creating cross-platform GUI applications. They offer a rich set of widgets and are well-documented.
   - **Tkinter**: A simpler and built-in library for creating GUIs, which is easy to get started with and sufficient for many small to medium-sized applications.

2. **Java**:
   - **JavaFX** or **Swing**: Java provides robust support for desktop applications with these frameworks. JavaFX, in particular, is modern and offers a rich set of features for building visually appealing applications.

3. **C#**:
   - **.NET Core with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: This is a powerful framework for building Windows desktop applications. With the introduction of .NET 5 and later, you can also target Linux and macOS, making it a good choice for cross-platform development.
   - **Avalonia**: An open-source framework for building cross-platform .NET applications with a similar API to WPF.

4. **C++**:
   - **Qt** or **GTK**: These are mature and feature-rich libraries for creating cross-platform desktop applications. Qt, in particular, is known for its comprehensive set of tools and documentation.

Each of these options has its strengths, and the best choice depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you are looking for a quick and straightforward way to develop cross-platform applications, Python with PyQt or PySide, or Java with JavaFX, might be excellent choices. For more complex and high-performance applications, C# with WPF or C++ with Qt could be more suitable.

I hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck with your desktop application development journey!
