If the sampling is done with replacement (i.e., committees can overlap), then the failure

which calculates the probability that no less than x nodes are corrupt in a committee of m nodes
sampled from an inﬁnite pool of nodes, where the probability of each node being corrupt is f = t/n.
If the sampling is done without replacement (as in RapidChain), then the binomial distribution can
still be used to approximate (and bound) the failure probability for one committee. However, when
the committee size gets larger relative to the population size, the hypergeometric distribution yields
a better approximation (e.g., roughly 3x smaller failure probability for n = 2000, m = 200, t

Proof. The sampler graph selection process can be seen as the classic balls-and-bins process: |L|dL
balls (parties) are thrown independently and uniformly at random into |R| bins (groups). Without
loss of generality we can assume we ﬁrst through all dishonest parties (bad balls) then all the honest
parties (good balls).
For a ﬁx committee C, let X❕ be a random variable representing the maximum number of dis-
honest parties assigned to C, Xb be a random variable representing the minimum number of honest
parties assigned to C, µ❕ and µb be the expected number of honest and dishonest parties per group
respectively.
It is well known that the distribution of the number of (good/bad) balls in a bin is approximately
Poisson with mean µb = dL|L|/4 and µ❕ = 3dL|L|/4 [53, Chapter 5]. let ˜X and be the Poisson random
variable approximating X. We have µ = E[X] = E[ ˜X]. We use the following Chernoﬀ bounds from
[53, Chapter 5] for Poisson random variables:
Pr( ˜X ≥ x) ≤ e
Pr( ˜X ≤ x) ≤ e
−µ(eµ/x)x, when x > µ,
−µ(eµ/x)x, when x  x and Xb < x. This is to make sure a good group has
honest majority. Note that this deﬁnition is an under-estimation and we do not count some of the
good groups. Based on this deﬁnition, a group is bad if X❕ ≤ x or Xb ≥ x.
The the probability that a ﬁxed committee being bad is:
−µb(eµb/x)x + e
−µ❕(eµ❕/x)x .

Now, consider a subset of groups of size |R(cid:48)|, the probability that all of them being bad is,
(e−µb(eµb/x)x + e−µ❕(eµ❕/x)x)|R(cid:48)|.
Since the adversary can choose the bad parties and the bad groups, we use union bound over all
