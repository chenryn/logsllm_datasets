User: I have created a bot for my website and I currently host in on heroku.com. 
I run it by executing the command 
heroku run --app cghelper python bot.py
This executes the command perfectly through CMD and runs that specific .py file in my github repo. 
The issue is when I close the cmd window this stops the bot.py. How can I get the to run automatically. 
Thanks
Assistant: Not sure but try: 
heroku run --app cghelper python bot.py &
