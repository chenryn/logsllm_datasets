from an escape destination. (AC/AL) ∗ 100 gives

the escape path’s coverage area percentage. The area AL is not
trivial to calculate as the location of water bodies are not pre
known within the interest area. The area AC is also not trivial
to calculate as the escape destinations may be densely popu-
lated and many may overlap. To solve this, we implemented
Monte-Carlo simulations. The simulation works by generating
millions of uniformly distributed points within the interest
area. It maintains two separate counters: PL to count all the
meters of any road), and
points that are on land (i.e., within r
PC to count all points within an escape destination’s radius
meters of any escape destination). With these
(i.e., within r
counters, the area AL can be calculated as AL = (PL/P )∗ A,
where P is the total number of points, and the area AC can
be calculated as AC = (PC/P ) ∗ A. Therefore, the ﬁnal
coverage area percentage of the escape paths using Monte-
Carlo simulation can be expressed as (PC/PL) ∗ 100. The
coverage percent is the ratio of the coverage area calculated
(using a 100 m walking radius) to the total area of land
calculated using the Monte-Carlo simulation.

The results are shown in Figure 11. It can be observed that
cities with more regular grid-like patterns such as Chicago and
Manhattan, New York City are more vulnerable to attacks. In
these cities, an attacker can, on average, cover more then 30%
of the target land area without being detected. For many routes,
they can even cover more than 60% of the target land area.
However, more irregular cities like London, Frankfurt and
Atlanta offer more resistance. It is important to note that it is
still possible to reach 20% of the target geographic region even
in these most limiting cases. The percent of coverage reduces
as route or trip distances increases because as trip length
increases so does the probability of the presence of an unique
road segment, but also because the area of interest grows
quadratically in the distance between source and destination.
For instance, for a distance of 20km, the area of interest is
400km2 and the coverage is 40km2 which is still signiﬁcant.
Also, note that the above calculations present a lower-bound on
the total coverage area AC. This is because errors in distance
calculation from the accelerometer allows the attacker to cover
much larger distances. For example, in a number of escape

routes computed in our evaluation, up to 82% of ﬁnal escape
destinations were located even beyond the area of interest used
for evaluation, with a mean of ≈ 46%.
Evaluation of integrated attack: We evaluated the perfor-
mance of the integrated spoofer on 10 routes. The spoofed
routes were chosen such that either the source or destination
was close to the university area and the other end-point
was within a 6km radius of the university. For each of the
spoofed path, the system selected a corresponding escape path
with the maximum displacement. In our set, we found this
displacement to range between .7km to 2.1km. During the
experiment, we drove the escape paths while spooﬁng the
GPS and magnetometer with the spoofed path. The following
information were recorded: the accelerometer, gyroscope and
magnetometer sensors and the GPS locations. We also drove
the spoofed paths to obtain baseline recordings. The attack was
successful for all the chosen paths despite trafﬁc stops, lights,
or congestion. The spoofed locations (displayed on the phone)
matched the chosen locations and the turns were synchronized
between the escape and spoofed paths. We have uploaded a
short video2 demonstrating the attack. The maximum delay
between receiving current escape path location and computing
the spoofed location was ≈ 60ms with most spoofed locations
computed within 4−5ms of obtaining the current location. For
quantitative comparison, we also drove the spoofed path and
recorded all the sensor measurements and compared it with the
escape path measurements. The results are shown in Figure 12.
The path errors are computed as the difference in the sensor
measurements between the spoofed route and the escape route.
The ‘GPS path errors’ are based on the calculations performed
using GPS data and the ‘sensor path errors’ are the estimates
using the inertial sensors. We then compare it with the open
‘reference’ dataset [47] recorded from 140 different routes. We
observe that the error distributions are similar to the reference
dataset. For example, the gyroscope errors (both curvature and
turns) are within the range reported by the reference dataset
with ≈ 85−90% (≈ 90−95% for sensor baseline) of turns and
≈ 75−80% (≈ 70−75% for sensor baseline) of curves within
the ranges deﬁned in our algorithm. We also observed that the
accelerometer and magnetometer data are more sensitive to
noise (e.g., magnets in car’s dashboard) than the gyroscope.

V. COUNTERMEASURES
◦
A. Deploying Accurate Accelerometer and Gyroscope Sensors
An obvious approach to mitigating the threat would be to
use high quality sensors. To measure the impact of sensor noise
on the potential of spooﬁng, we re-ran the simulations on the
cities using lower thresholds for the sensor noise. For this
evaluation, we set the thresholds using the 25th percentile of
the error distributions (c.f., Figure 5). The following thresholds
◦
,
were set for the escape paths generator algorithm: Tθ = 1.4
, Td1 = 0.6 and Td2 = 1.6. Figure 13a shows the
Tϑ = 0.2
results of the simulations for all the cities. Using the above
thresholds, we see a signiﬁcant reduction in the percentage of
routes that allow more than 5 km of displacement. However,
there are several limitations with this approach. First, the sen-
sors satisfying the above parameters are equivalent to aviation
and military-grade sensors which are bulky and expensive
(several thousands of dollars) to deploy. Furthermore, they
consume signiﬁcant amount of power ((cid:2) 5 watts) making
it unsuitable for use in majority of tracking applications.
Moreover, the attacker can still induce noise in the sensors by
driving recklessly (e.g., rapid accelerations, lane switching).
B. Secure Navigation Path Selection
We present a path selection algorithm that provides better
mitigation than deploying accurate sensors, without requiring
any changes to existing GPS/INS tracking systems. The idea is
to generate a single “secure path” for travel. This path is less
favorable for spooﬁng because the curvatures or turn angles
of the path are more unique and, therefore, less likely to be
found in other sections of the road network. Furthermore, even
