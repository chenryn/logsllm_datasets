The latest version of Electron (0.36.0) still has an issue on Yosemite with
fullscreen.
Basically when in fullscreen mode the window shows a textured title at the
top:

This happens regardless if the window frame option is set to true or false
(the only difference being you don't see the traffic lights on hover when set
to false). However setting the transparent option to true removes the titlebar
completely and solves it.
So in short it needs to hide the titlebar when transparency is set to false
and in fullscreen and then ONLY show the title when hovering and the frame is
set to true.
