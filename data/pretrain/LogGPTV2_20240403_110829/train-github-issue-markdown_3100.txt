## Expected Behavior
Expected at least nested objects be supported and parsed correctly from query
## Current Behavior
It takes the whole thing as a key, instead of creating an nested object  
Doesn't matter the format, none of them works  
`/?nested[key]=value`  
or  
`/?nested.key=value`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Open the page with the pattern above
  2. Print the this.props.url.query in top level page component
  3. Does not work
  4. 
## Context
I can't pass nested object over arbitrarily if I am not using ``
component, actually I'm not sure if `` would work with nested object
since it is using npm 'url' which does not supported nested object parsing...
Btw, I'm currently using https://github.com/ljharb/qs for parsing atm, I hope
this saves you all time if you are looking for alternatives.
