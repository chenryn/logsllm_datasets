device hidden beneath the table is used for ultrasonic signal
modulation and voice recording. The signal processor mod-
ulates the received baseband signal into the excitation signal
e(t) in Eq. (11) below. It is worth noting that: according to
the Nyquist theorem, the sampling rate of e(t) must be at
least twice the highest frequency of the signal to avoid signal
aliasing. The signal processor can be in the form of a portable
mobile phone with a relatively high sampling rate such as
Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, with the addition of an ampliﬁer
connected to the ultrasonic transducer. The transducer then
transforms the excitation signal into ultrasonic guided wave to
be propagated through the materials. Meanwhile, the tapping
device will record the responses, which are transferred back to
the controller in real time. Based on the responses, the attacker
can create the followup commands through controller. As such,
the interaction continues.
B. Ultrasonic Attack Signal Generation
Without direct control over the voice controllable system,
the attacker needs to carefully design inaudible voice com-
mands. In particular, SurﬁngAttack produces the modulated

to be received by the device’s microphone through mechanical
coupling.
Unlike the ultrasonic attack over the air, narrowband
window functions are used to modulate signals to reduce
wave dispersal, and the excitation signal must be preprocessed
before stimulating the guided Lamb waves. The signal pre-
processing ensures: (1) an appropriate frequency bandwidth
of the excitation signal in order to reduce signal distortion
due to dispersion; (2) a properly modulated signal to avoid
introducing audible sound.
Traditionally, guided wave testing uses a limited cycle
sinusoidal tone burst, which is often modulated by a Hann
window [46]. However, the Hann window eliminates high-
frequency signal characteristics. In order to preserve the simi-
larity between the recovered voice signal and the original sig-
nal, Tukey window (also known as the cosine-tapered window)
is used for modulation to form the excitation signal, described
as follows:
e (t) = (1 + m · v (t)) · w (t) · cos (2πfct) ,
(11)
where m is the depth of the modulation, which can be selected
in [0.8, 1] based on empirical experimental results, and w(t)
represents the Tukey window:

w(t) =

(12)
where r is a real number between 0 and 1. If r = 0, it
returns to a rectangular window; if r = 1, it becomes a Hann
window. In this study, we adjust r in the range of [0.1, 0.5] to
achieve the best attack performance on different target phones.
Tukey window offers a ﬂat top window shape to control the
amplitude attenuation of time-series data, which protects v(t)
from distortion. The modulated signals will be used as attack
signals for the PZT transducer to excite ultrasound waves.

To activate the voice assistants, the baseband signal v(t)
will embed the wake words such as “OK Google” in front
of the attack commands. We use existing speech synthesis
techniques to generate the wake words of a speciﬁc voice [33],
and the attack commands can be simply generated using TTS
systems. However, in our experiments, we discover that after
the activation command wakes up the assistant, the device
creates a short vibration for haptic feedback to indicate the
assistant is ready. This vibration may negatively affect the
mechanical coupling, and thus reduce the attack success rate
of the subsequent attack commands. In response, we insert
a multi-seconds gap between the wake words and attack
commands to eliminate the vibration’s impact.
C. New Attacks Enabled by Interactive Hidden Attack
All mobile phones provide voice call service and Short
Message Service (SMS). Text messages or phone calls from
acquaintance are usually considered safe and trustworthy. With
the growing popularity of two-factor authentication, phone
veriﬁcation has become one major means for identity authenti-
cation in a wide variety of web applications, including banks,
social networks, retail stores, email services, etc. Therefore, it
can be a serious threat if the attacker is able to unnoticeably

control the victim’s phone to read/reply/send text messages,
or make fraud calls to friends through a synthesized voice.
Here, we weaponize SurﬁngAttack to show its real-world threat
by demonstrating an SMS passcode hacking attack and a
fraud call attack (check out video demo in https://surﬁngattack.
github.io/).
SMS Passcode Hacking. Texting while driving has been
widely regarded as a dangerous activity for both the drivers
and the pedestrians. As a result, most virtual assistants have
offered features for listening and replying to text messages just
using voice commands, e.g., “read my messages” command
for Google Assistant or Siri, or “show me the most recent
message” command for Bixby. However, these features open
up opportunities for attackers as well. Moreover, the impact
of SMS hacking has been magniﬁed due to its adoption as
the most universal and convenient two-factor authentication
technique. We describe the details of the SMS passcode
hacking attack below.
The attack procedure is displayed in Fig. 8(a). First, an
inaudible command “OK Google, turn the volume to three”
will activate the assistant and turn down the volume. With
such a low volume, the device’s responses become difﬁcult
to notice by human ears in an ofﬁce environment with a
moderate noise level. When a new message with the passcode
arrives, the attack device sends “read my messages”. Once
the victim device receives the command, it displays the most
recent message, state the sender of the message, and ask if
the owner wants to hear it or skip it. The tapping device (i.e.,
a commercial microphone) captures the message and sends it
to the attacker. In response, a subsequent inaudible command
“hear it” is then delivered to victim device, with which the
assistant will read the contents of the message. Finally, the
tapping device underneath the table can capture the sound and
send it to the attacker to extract the passcode. This process
allows the attacker to extract the passcode, when the device
is placed on the tabletop and the assistant reads the message
without alerting the owner.
Fraud Call. Phone call is one the most common ways
of communication methods nowadays. There has been a sig-
niﬁcant increase in the number of phone scams in the past

for consumers and businesses [38]. In general, it is common
for us to ignore unrecognized phone calls. Yet, when we
receive a phone call from an acquaintance or a contact, we
will subconsciously relax our vigilance. The advanced phone
scams rely on caller ID spooﬁng to deceive the victims into
believing that the call comes from a “trusted” caller, for which
effective defense mechanisms have been proposed [14]. Using
SurﬁngAttack, it is possible to place a fraud call attack via the
direct control of victim’s device, bypassing the caller authenti-
cation framework [8]. In this case study, we use SurﬁngAttack
to initiate a fraud call through victim’s device placed on the
tabletop without touching the device. SurﬁngAttack allows the
attackers to control the victim’s device to call someone and
conduct a multi-round conversation using the hidden ultrasonic
transducer and tapping device. Fig. 8(b) shows a fraud call
example in which the adversary controls Alice’s device to call
her friend Sam and deceive him into revealing the access code.
V. ATTACK EVALUATION
We validate SurﬁngAttack experimentally on 17 popular
mobile devices with intelligent voice assistants based on the
following three objectives: (a) examining the feasibility of
SurﬁngAttack; (b) quantifying the parameters in tuning a suc-
cessful attack; (c) measuring the attack command recognition
performance. This section describes the experimental setup and
results in detail.
A. Experimental Setup
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all the experiments utilize the
default experiment equipment as shown in Fig. 4, which
consists of a waveform generator as the signal modulator, and
a PZT transducer to excite inaudible voice commands. All
experiments are conducted in an indoor lab environment with
an average background noise of around 40 dB SPL.
One key question is how generalizable the attack is, i.e.
how dependent the proposed attack is on the hardware and soft-
ware of the victim target device. To list a few considerations,
the materials of the phone body may impact the mechanical
coupling between the phone and the table; the software of the
voice assistants may implement defense modules to differenti-
ate between inaudible commands and human voice commands.
To systematically evaluate potential factors, we examine the
proposed SurﬁngAttack on 17 different types of phones with
the same experiment setup and attack equipment. We place
the victim devices 30 cm away from the PZT transducer on
two different types of plates: a rectangular frosted glass plate,
which is commonly used as tabletops in modern high-end
working desks, with dimensions of 24 × 30 × 1/16 inch, and
a steel metal plate with dimensions of 24 × 24 × 1/16 inch.
For each target device, we run three types of attacks:
recording activation, direct activation, and direct recognition.
For recording activation, we ﬁrst allow the attack device to
send the activation command using ultrasonic guided waves
and record the sound. Then, the recording will be replayed
to attack the voice assistant. This attack tests if the recorded
sound has sufﬁcient quality to perform the attack. For direct
activation, we send the activation command, i.e., “OK Google”
or “hey Siri”, directly via ultrasonic guided waves. For direct

to 5 kHz) baseband signal (1st harmonic) and 2nd harmonic

recognition, we send inaudible voice commands directly to
control the device, such as: “call 123456”, “take a selﬁe”,
“read my messages”, after we manually activate the voice
assistant. The attacks are considered successful when the
assistant correctly executes the injected commands. We repeat
the experiment for each device when the device is either placed
facing up or facing down, and record the attack outcomes.
B. Feasibility Experiment Results
Table I summarizes the experimental results, which show
that SurﬁngAttack can successfully attack 15 out of 17 mobile
devices as listed, while the orientation of the devices (i.e.,
placed facing up or down) has negligible impacts on the attack
performance, which is likely due to the small form factor
of these mobile devices. Since different devices often have
different voice capture hardware (e.g. microphones, ampliﬁers,
ﬁlters), hardware layouts, and designs of the phone body, there
are always variations of digitized audios supplied to the voice
assistants. However, attack signal frequency fc is the dominant
factor that determines the attack’s feasibility. The average
amplitude of the demodulated chirp baseband signals, which is
used to evaluate the non-linearity property (see Section III-B),
is employed for selecting the optimal fc.
As an example, we measure the demodulated baseband
signal on a Samsung Galaxy S7 with various fc ranging from
24 kHz to 36 kHz, and compute the mean amplitude of the
demodulated chirp signal, as shown in Fig. 9. Ideally, the
demodulated baseband signal should have a high 1st harmonic
h1 and a low 2nd harmonic h2. We select the optimal fc
by considering the amplitude difference of the 1st harmonic
and 2nd harmonic of demodulated signals according to the
following formula:
f opt
c = argmax
fc
((h1 − h2) · h1).
c
For Samsung Galaxy S7, f opt
= 25.8 kHz. We achieve
high non-linearity responses for the 15 devices which were
successfully attacked, but attain low non-linearity responses
for the other two devices. We ﬁnd that all the 15 devices
are subject to all three types of attacks using different attack
frequencies. We also notice that both Xiaomi Mi 5 and
Huawei Mate 9 use the same Android 8.0, but Huawei Mate
9 successfully counters our attack. We believe that the phone
structure or the microphone used in Huawei Mate 9 suppressed
