### Guidelines for Securing Your VoIP PBX

#### Information Leakage Prevention (Confidentiality)
1. **Block Scanners:**
   - Use firewall rules or a VoIP security appliance to block known scanners and credential cracking behaviors. Refer to our iptables rules for specific configurations.
   
2. **Modify User-Agent:**
   - Change the User-Agent value to a generic or alternate system type to mislead attackers. For example, change "Asterisk" to "Avaya CM."
   
3. **Customize SIP Realm:**
   - Set or change the default SIP realm to avoid easy identification.

4. **Custom Audio Prompts:**
   - Use a different set of audio prompts than the system default to reduce fingerprinting.

5. **Packet Capture Analysis:**
   - Take a packet capture and look for identifying fields. Investigate how to change these fields to minimize information leakage.

6. **Session Border Controller (SBC):**
   - Consider using an SBC to anchor sessions, perform NAT, and filter out identifying fields with header manipulation rules (topology hiding).

#### Management & Services Assurance (Integrity)
1. **Follow Hardening Guides:**
   - Adhere to vendor-specific hardening guides, such as [THIS guide].

2. **Restrict Administrative Access:**
   - Do not expose PBX admin interfaces to the Internet. Block access to management IP address ranges and protocols on edge routers or firewalls.

3. **Require Secure Access:**
   - Mandate the use of a VPN for all management functions.

4. **Unique SIP Usernames:**
   - Ensure SIP usernames do not match extensions.

5. **Strong Passwords:**
   - Use long, complex passwords and change them regularly.

6. **Secure Management Protocols:**
   - Use secure, encrypted management protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) and audit the encryption algorithms configured. Note that "None" is a valid HTTPS algorithm, meaning no encryption is performed.

7. **Secure Out-of-Band Ports:**
   - Do not assume that out-of-band management ports are safe. An attacker can pivot from a compromised internal network to a management network.

8. **Minimize Software Footprint:**
   - Avoid monolithic PBX distributions or be diligent about auditing and shutting down unnecessary services. For example, disable AMI if it is not needed.

9. **Patch Regularly:**
   - Sign up for vendor security notifications and apply patches promptly.

10. **Use TLS and SRTP:**
    - Where feasible, use TLS to protect VoIP signaling and SRTP to protect media. Issue your own certificates or purchase public certificates; do not reuse existing vendor certificates.

11. **Mutual Authentication:**
    - Employ mutual authentication in TLS to ensure both client and server validate each other. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and encryption downgrades. While client certificates can be time-consuming to administer, even a single organizational certificate will greatly enhance security.

#### Denial of Service (DoS) Mitigation
1. **DoS Mitigation Devices:**
   - Use DoS mitigation devices to block volumetric attacks and challenge the setup of new TCP and UDP sessions.

2. **On-Premises and Cloud Scrubbing:**
   - Combine on-premises detection and cleaning with cloud scrubbing capabilities.

3. **SIP Message Enforcement:**
   - Use a security appliance to enforce SIP message format and session state to prevent out-of-state floods and oddly formatted messages that can crash the system.

4. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Apply rate limiting on edge routers.

5. **BCP 38 / RFC2827:**
   - Implement BCP 38 / RFC2827 to ban private IP ranges as public source IPs, which are sometimes used in attacks.

6. **Host Rate Limiting:**
   - Use iptables and fail2ban to apply rate limiting on the host in case edge protections are not sufficient.

7. **High-Availability and Multi-Site Deployment:**
   - Consider high-availability or multi-site deployment for critical systems to ensure availability.

#### Detection & Prevention of Fraud & Abuse
1. **Avoid Default Extensions:**
   - Do not use three-digit extensions, which are the default for SIPVicious. If using longer extensions, avoid starting with "1000."

2. **Fraud Protections from Telecom Provider:**
   - Inquire about fraud protections offered by your telecom provider. Many providers offer default settings or paid services to block certain types of calls, cap spending, or eliminate calls to high-cost destinations.

3. **Limit Call Forwarding and Voicemail Callback:**
   - Restrict or eliminate the use of call forwarding, voicemail callback, and dialing out from voicemail.

4. **Block International Dialing:**
   - Block international dialing when possible and require a PIN code for accessing international trunks. Be aware that some international destinations are within the North American Numbering Plan. Refer to NANPA for the complete list.

5. **Disable Unused Extensions:**
   - Delete or administratively disable unused extensions. Once cracked, unused extensions can be abused longer than active ones.

6. **Audit User Passwords:**
   - Regularly audit user passwords by attempting to crack them.

7. **Enforce SIP Message Rates:**
   - Enforce application (SIP) message rates and the number of active sessions using thresholds and blacklisting.

8. **Real-Time Fraud Detection:**
   - Monitor real-time signaling for fraud patterns using a fraud detection system in-line or in monitor/tap mode. Call Detail Records can be modified if a system is sufficiently compromised.

9. **Traffic Baseline Monitoring:**
   - Security or fraud management systems should be capable of learning normal traffic baselines and watching for changes in ratio, frequency, or direction.
