followed by JavaScript and HTML ﬁles. We see that, on average, 5 fewer requests
were made for images, while 3 fewer JS and 2 fewer requests for HTML objects
were made. This is, in many ways, as expected since images make up the core of
ads [25], and are typically requested asynchronously by JavaScript or included
in HTML pages.
Fig. 1. 90th percentile for the number of requests the types of objects most associ-
ated with ads. The most blocked type of objects are images, seen in the right-most
line, followed by JavaScript and HTML objects. Java Scripts are used typically for
asynchronous loading of ads while HTML objects are used for iFrame ads.
Overall Impact on QoE. In the following paragraphs we focus on the impact
that the decreased number of objects requested has on user QoE as captured by
TTFP, PLT, and SI.
Page Load Time (PLT). Page load time (PLT), the most ubiquitous QoE metric,
is an approximation of the time it takes for all objects on the website to load.
PLT is typically measured as the time between when a page is requested and
when the OnLoad event is ﬁred by the browser. While some studies have explored
other estimates of PLT (such as perceived PLT [15]), we use the traditional PLT
metric as our proxy for user QoE.

bottom 10% and top 10%.
Figure 2a shows the CDFs of PLT with the complete distribution in the center
and the bottom and top 10% of the distribution at the left and right of the ﬁgure,
respectively. The average PLT is approximately 40 s when loaded without ABP.
Using ABP yields and improvement of 5 s, in average. The improvement is even
more noticeable in the bottom ten percentile (left-most graph of Fig. 2a), with
websites loading 14% faster with ABP enabled, as a consequence of loading fewer
objects.
Time to First Paint (TTFP). The impact of ad-blocker usage on Time to First
Paint is quite diﬀerent. TTFP captures the time it takes to begin rendering the
ﬁrst objects of a website [35]. When a user navigates to a website, the browser
requests the initial HTML page before requesting and rendering the content.
TTFP is a function of the complexity of the webpage and the latency to servers
hosting the content and is considered an important factor of web QoE, as a lower
TTFP means less time a user must wait before starting to view an active site.
Figure 2b shows the CDF of TTFP in milliseconds. The ﬁgure contains a
similar set of three graphs as with PLT, with the whole distribution in the
center and the bottom and top 10% of the distribution at each side of the ﬁgure.
The ﬁgure shows the clearly negative impact of ad-blocker usage on ﬁrst
paint time, particularly for the lower 10% of the distribution. This delay results
from the time it takes for the ad-blocker to decide whether or not it should block
an object. Even if the absolute time to process URLs through the EasyList is
small, this small overhead can have a signiﬁcant impact on TTFP for the fastest
sites, many of which ﬁnish the painting of the ﬁrst object in less than a second
without ad-blocking.
Summary. The use of ad-blocker introduces a constant processing overhead from
checking each URL request with the ﬁlter list. For many sites, the reduction in
the number of ads’ associated objects requested yields clear improvements on

PLT. As most ads are loaded asynchronously with JavaScript, however, these
beneﬁts do not oﬀset the processing overhead by the time of painting of the ﬁrst
object (TTFP). The following paragraphs explore this trade-oﬀ.
4 Crowd-Sourced Evaluation of Trade-Oﬀs in QoE
The results from the previous section show a clear trade-oﬀ in the use of ad-
blocker between the responsiveness of a website and the total time the user spend
waiting on a page to load – for a large number of sites, ad-blocking improves
PLT at a signiﬁcant cost on TTFP.
The relative importance of these two metrics to overall users’ QoE, however,
is not well understood. To explore this we run a large, crowd-sourced experiment
of Web QoE; the following paragraphs describe our experimental methodology
and present a summary of our ﬁndings.
4.1 Crowd-Sourced Experiment Methodology
Our goal is to capture the impact of the trade-oﬀ between PLT and TTFP on
users’ perception. To this end, we need the ability to present a large random set
of users with both version of a website, with and without ad-blocker, under the
same or similar network conditions.
Experiment Setting. We conduct a user study with 1,000 users on Amazon
Mechanical Turk.5 In our experiments, we direct workers to a website under our
control and present them with two versions (with and without Adblock Plus)
for each of a sample of sites.6 For each Human Intelligence Task (HIT), a user is
presented with both versions of 10 sites, loaded with and without ad-blocking,
and asked to select the site that “loaded faster.”
The websites we use in these experiments were selected, at random, from a
subset of 965 websites, from our corpus of 5,000, that show both a signiﬁcantly
slower TTFP and a faster PLT when loaded with Adblock Plus.
As in Varvello et al. [33], rather than using live sites during these experiments,
we collect videos of the websites loading through WebPageTest under controlled
conditions. Videos recorded with WebPageTest have the time included and end
with a gray tinted frame. We modiﬁed the server to remove these and make sure
the user has no indication of when the website has loaded. We use these videos
to provide a consistent experience to all participants, regardless of their network
connections and device conﬁgurations.
We use two diﬀerent types of instructions during an experiment to ensure we
capture the proper response. The ﬁrst set of instructions, or primer, informs the
user as to what they should be looking for during the experiment, asking them
to Immediately select the video they believe loaded ﬁrst.

The second set of instructions, or directions, instructs users on how to make
their actual selection by asking them: Once one of the websites ﬁnishes loading,
immediately click the video.
Pre- and Post-experiment Survey. Before each experiment, we collect some basic
demographic information on users’ including gender, age group and country of
residence. In addition, we ask two additional questions regarding their familiarity
with technology: the range of hours spent online on a typical day, and their
own rating of their personal technological expertise. These last questions look
to determine the impact a user’s perceived level of technical proﬁciency and
experience has on their sensitivity to the performance changes introduced by
ad-block.
We also include an exit survey that users must complete before submitting
their HIT to Amazon. We ask users whether, in their selection of the page which
loaded ﬁrst, they opted for the page which ﬁrst showed content or the page which
appeared to have loaded everything ﬁrst. Here we are interested in determining
what eﬀect, if any, the user’s interpretation of loaded faster has on their selection.
Quality Control. We apply a number of common techniques to validate the
quality of our crowd-sourced data. First, we restrict our survey to workers that
have completed ≥50 HITs and have an approval rating ≥95%. Second, beyond
our 10 sites, sampled from a larger set of websites where ad-blocking impact
on QoE is ambiguous, we include 2 other websites as control cases. Both cases,
placed randomly among the other 10 sites, present an obvious choice of “loading
faster” in either the right or left of the screen. We employ this as a form of
quality control on all of the HITs. All 1,000 HITs correctly chose the control
cases. We received 1,080 experiment results and eliminated 5.6% (52) of them
that were partially completed (rated less than 10 sites).
Ethical Considerations. Amazon’s conditions of use explicitly prohibit tasks that
gather personally identiﬁable information (PII). The information we did collect
is coarse enough that we have no reasonable way to map it to individuals. Our
experiments collect data “about what”, rather than “about whom”, through
the relatively innocuous task of selecting videos. Our institution’s Institutional
Review Board (IRB) did not consider our experiment human subject research.
4.2 Summary of Results
Looking at the set of individual experiments, summarized in Table 2, we see that
users chose the website loaded without ad-blocker 71.5% of the time as the one
“loading faster”. Focusing on users rather than individual page comparisons, we
ﬁnd that 86.7% of them choose the non-ad-blocker option as “loading faster”
the majority of the time.
This clear preference for non-ad-blocking appears to be independent of any
user attribute, including their age, gender, locale and even their self-reported
technical proﬁciency. As an example, Fig. 3a shows users’ majority preference,
Table 2. Experiments and user majority preference for ad-blocking and non-ad-
blocking. In 71.5% of tests users selected non-ad-blocking as loaded faster.

broken down by technical proﬁciency. The ﬁgure combines users with below aver-
age and average self-reported technical proﬁciency, as only 3.8% of users selected
the former. When examining the results of users’ preferences by technical pro-
ﬁciency, there is not signiﬁcant diﬀerence in their preferences, with “average”
proﬁciency and “above average” proﬁciency choosing the non-ad-blocking option
95% and 93% of the time, respectively.
Interestingly enough, this clear preference is even independent of the user’s
own understanding of what they consider “loading faster” – the site that show
some content ﬁrst or the one that loaded everything ﬁrst. When aggregating users
based on this, we ﬁnd that despite 65.1% of users selecting loaded everything as
their deﬁnition of “loading faster”, a large fraction of them opted for the non-
ad-blocking option that yields a shorter time to ﬁrst-content (and longer loading
time). Table 3 shows the number of users that selected majority non-ad-blocking
(“NAB”) or ad-blocking (“AB”), separated by their deﬁnition of “loading faster”
from the exit survey. Over 96% of users selecting “loading everything” opted for
the non-ad-blocking (NAB) version.
For validation, Fig. 3b plots the time users take to make a decision, aggre-
gated by their choice of “loading faster” in the exit survey. As expected, users
who are looking for the ﬁrst content take less time to select a webpage than
users who are looking for everything to be loaded.
