### Analysis of Ad-Blocking Impact on Web Performance

#### Object Request Reduction
The following data points indicate the 90th percentile for the number of requests made for different types of objects most associated with ads:

- **Images**: 20.0, 51.0, 79.0, 116.0, 177.0
- **JavaScript**: 20.2, 56.0, 93.0, 140.0, 237.0
- **HTML**: 0.99, 0.91, 0.85, 0.83, 0.75

On average, there were 5 fewer requests for images, 3 fewer for JavaScript files, and 2 fewer for HTML objects. This reduction is expected since images are a core component of ads, often loaded asynchronously via JavaScript or included in HTML pages.

**Figure 1.** 90th percentile for the number of requests for objects most associated with ads. The most blocked type of objects are images, followed by JavaScript and HTML objects. JavaScript is typically used for asynchronous ad loading, while HTML objects are used for iFrame ads.

### Overall Impact on Quality of Experience (QoE)

In the following sections, we will focus on how the reduced number of object requests impacts user QoE, as measured by Time to First Paint (TTFP), Page Load Time (PLT), and Speed Index (SI).

#### Page Load Time (PLT)
Page load time (PLT) is a widely used QoE metric that approximates the time it takes for all objects on a website to load. PLT is typically measured from the moment a page is requested until the `OnLoad` event is fired by the browser. While some studies have explored alternative estimates of PLT, such as perceived PLT [15], we use the traditional PLT metric as our proxy for user QoE.

**Figure 2a.** Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of Page Load Time (PLT). The figure includes the complete distribution in the center, with the bottom and top 10% of the distribution at the left and right, respectively. The average PLT without Adblock Plus (ABP) is approximately 40 seconds. With ABP enabled, the average PLT improves by 5 seconds. The improvement is more pronounced in the bottom 10% of the distribution, where websites load 14% faster due to fewer object requests.

#### Time to First Paint (TTFP)
Time to First Paint (TTFP) measures the time it takes for the first content to be rendered on a website [35]. When a user navigates to a website, the browser first requests the initial HTML page before requesting and rendering additional content. TTFP is influenced by the complexity of the webpage and the latency to servers hosting the content. A lower TTFP is crucial for web QoE, as it reduces the waiting time before the user can start viewing the site.

**Figure 2b.** CDFs of TTFP in milliseconds. The figure includes the complete distribution in the center, with the bottom and top 10% of the distribution at the left and right, respectively. The use of an ad-blocker has a negative impact on TTFP, particularly in the lower 10% of the distribution. This delay is due to the time it takes for the ad-blocker to decide whether to block an object. Even though the absolute time to process URLs through the EasyList is small, this overhead can significantly affect TTFP for fast-loading sites.

### Summary
The use of an ad-blocker introduces a constant processing overhead from checking each URL request against the filter list. For many sites, the reduction in the number of ad-related objects requested leads to clear improvements in PLT. However, these benefits do not offset the processing overhead by the time of the first paint (TTFP), as most ads are loaded asynchronously with JavaScript.

### Crowd-Sourced Evaluation of Trade-Offs in QoE

The results from the previous section show a clear trade-off in the use of ad-blockers between the responsiveness of a website and the total time the user spends waiting for a page to load. To better understand the relative importance of these metrics to overall user QoE, we conducted a large, crowd-sourced experiment. The following paragraphs describe our experimental methodology and present a summary of our findings.

#### Crowd-Sourced Experiment Methodology

**Experiment Setting:**
- **Participants:** 1,000 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
- **Task:** Users were directed to a website under our control and presented with two versions (with and without Adblock Plus) for each of a sample of 10 sites. They were asked to select the site that "loaded faster."
- **Selection Criteria:** Websites were randomly selected from a subset of 965 sites that showed both a significantly slower TTFP and a faster PLT when loaded with Adblock Plus.
- **Consistent Experience:** We used videos of the websites loading through WebPageTest under controlled conditions to provide a consistent experience to all participants, regardless of their network connections and device configurations.

**Pre- and Post-experiment Survey:**
- **Demographic Information:** Gender, age group, country of residence, hours spent online, and self-reported technical expertise.
- **Exit Survey:** Users were asked whether they opted for the page that first showed content or the one that appeared to have loaded everything first.

**Quality Control:**
- **Worker Selection:** Restricted to workers with ≥50 HITs and an approval rating ≥95%.
- **Control Cases:** Included 2 control websites with an obvious choice of "loading faster" to validate the quality of responses. All 1,000 HITs correctly chose the control cases.
- **Data Validation:** Eliminated 5.6% (52) of partially completed HITs (rated less than 10 sites).

**Ethical Considerations:**
- **Data Privacy:** Collected coarse information that cannot be mapped to individuals. Our experiments collect data "about what," rather than "about whom," through the task of selecting videos. Our institution's Institutional Review Board (IRB) did not consider this human subject research.

#### Summary of Results

**Table 2.** Experiments and user majority preference for ad-blocking and non-ad-blocking. In 71.5% of tests, users selected non-ad-blocking as "loading faster."

| Indicator            | Non-ad-blocking (%) | Ad-blocking (%) |
|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Experiments (10,000) | 71.5                | 28.5            |
| Users (1,000)        | 86.7                | 13.3            |

**Figure 3a.** Majority choice by technical proficiency. The figure combines users with below-average and average self-reported technical proficiency, as only 3.8% of users selected the former. Both "average" and "above average" proficiency groups preferred the non-ad-blocking option 95% and 93% of the time, respectively.

**Figure 3b.** Time taken per user based on their definition of "loading faster." Users who look for the first content take less time to select a webpage compared to those who wait for everything to load.

**Table 3.** Number of users for "NAB" and "AB" majority choice based on their definition of "loading faster" from the exit survey. Over 96% of users who selected "loading everything" opted for the non-ad-blocking (NAB) version.

This clear preference for non-ad-blocking appears to be independent of any user attribute, including age, gender, locale, and self-reported technical proficiency. Interestingly, even users who defined "loading faster" as the site that loaded everything first still preferred the non-ad-blocking option, which provides a shorter time to first content but a longer overall loading time.
