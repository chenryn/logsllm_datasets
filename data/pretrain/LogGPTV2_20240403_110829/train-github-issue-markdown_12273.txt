### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**
    * 7.0.0-beta.4 through 7.0.0, 8.x
  * **Operating System:**
    * macOS 10.14.6
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:** : 7.0.0-beta.3, 6.x
### Expected Behavior
Starting an app with a proxy server should not lead to a crash, the `login`
event should be emitted.
### Actual Behavior
Electron `7.0.0-beta.4`: Silent crash  
Electron `7.0.0-beta.5 â€“ 7.0.0`: `login` event not emitted, network non-
functional
### To Reproduce
You'll need a proxy server to reproduce the missing `login` event, which might
be a somewhat difficult to get. In our testing, the issue exists regardless of
the proxy server used (even a simple basic auth proxy fails just like a fancy
NTLM one).
