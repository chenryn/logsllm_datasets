User: TAB completion works fine in iPython terminal, but not in Firefox browser. 
So far I had tried but failed,
1). run a command $ sudo easy_install readline, 
then the .egg file was wrote in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/readline-6.2.4.1-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg,
but TAB completion still doesn't work in Jupyter Notebook.
2). also tried to find locate the ipython_notebook_config.py or  ipython_config.py, but failed.
I use Python 3.5 and iPython 4.0.0.  and both are installed in Ubuntu 15.10  /usr/share/anaconda3/bin/ipython.
Any help would be appreciated!
Assistant: As the question was asked five years ago, the answer was likely different back then... but I want to add my two cents if anyone googles today: The answer by users Sagnik and more above worked for me.
One thing to add is that if running anaconda, you can do what I did: simply

start the anaconda-navigator software,
locate the jedi package in my environment,
click the little checkbox on the right of jedi
under "Mark for specific version installation", choose 0.17.2

After restarting the kernel everything worked :)
