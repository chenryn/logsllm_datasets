# Throughput Comparison and Analysis

## 1. Throughput Comparison
### 1.1 Throughput Data
- **Throughput of tx1-rx1 (Single-Antenna Node Pair)**
  - 802.11n: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20] Mb/s
  - n+: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20] Mb/s

- **Throughput of tx2-rx2 (2-Antenna Node Pair)**
  - 802.11n: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20] Mb/s
  - n+: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20] Mb/s

- **Throughput of tx3-rx3 (3-Antenna Node Pair)**
  - 802.11n: [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] Mb/s
  - n+: [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] Mb/s

### 1.2 Figure 12: Throughput Comparison
- The figure compares the throughput obtained under n+ and the existing 802.11n design for the scenario in Figure 3.
- **tx1-rx1**: Single-antenna node pair
- **tx2-rx2**: 2-antenna node pair
- **tx3-rx3**: 3-antenna node pair

## 2. Interference Alignment Experiment
### 2.1 Experiment Setup
- **Node Pairs**:
  - **tx1-rx1**: Single-antenna node pair
  - **tx2-rx2**: 2-antenna node pair
  - **tx3-rx3**: 3-antenna node pair
- **Phases**:
  1. **Initial Measurement**: tx1 and tx2 transmit concurrently while tx3 remains silent to measure the SNR of the wanted stream at rx2 without interference from tx3.
  2. **Unwanted Stream Measurement**: tx3 transmits to rx2 alone to measure the SNR of the unwanted traffic in the absence of alignment.
  3. **Concurrent Transmission with Alignment**: All three transmitters transmit concurrently, and tx3 aligns its signal with that of tx1.

### 2.2 Results
- **SNR Difference**: The difference in SNR of the wanted stream due to the presence of the unwanted stream is plotted as a function of the SNR of the unwanted stream.
- **Key Observations**:
  - When the power of the unwanted stream without nulling or alignment is in the range [7.5, 32.5] dB, nulling and alignment reduce the impact of interference on the wanted signal to [0.5, 3] dB.
  - The residual interference after nulling or alignment depends on the original SNR of the unwanted signal before nulling or alignment. n+ sets a threshold L = 27 dB to limit the interference power.
  - Average interference power after nulling: 0.8 dB
  - Average interference power after alignment: 1.3 dB
  - Nulling has a lower residual error than alignment because it only requires estimating the channel from the interfering transmitter to the receiver, whereas alignment also requires estimating the unwanted subspace at the receiver.

## 3. Throughput Impact
### 3.1 Experiment Setup
- **Scenario**: The same as in Figure 3, with three node pairs: tx1-rx1, tx2-rx2, and tx3-rx3, having 1, 2, and 3 antennas respectively.
- **Run Configuration**: Different assignments of nodes to locations in Figure 10.
- **Contention Winners**: Randomly picked winners.
- **Transmission**:
  - **802.11n**: M-antenna node transmits a 1500-byte packet using M concurrent streams.
  - **n+**: M-antenna node transmits a 1500-byte packet using M streams, and later contention winners end their transmissions simultaneously with the first winner.
- **Bitrate Selection**: Based on the algorithm in [16], which maps the effective SNR to the optimal bitrate.

### 3.2 Results
- **Figure 12**: Plots the CDFs of the throughputs of each pair and the total throughput, both under n+ and 802.11n.
- **Key Observations**:
  - Total network throughput doubles with n+ compared to 802.11n.
  - Nodes with multiple antennas achieve significant throughput gains, increasing with the number of antennas.
    - 2-antenna pair: 1.5x average throughput gain
    - 3-antenna pair: 3.5x average throughput gain
  - Reasons for throughput gains:
    - n+ allows nodes to transmit three streams at any point, providing multiplexing gain.
    - In 802.11n, single-antenna nodes bottleneck the network, but in n+, multi-antenna nodes can join ongoing transmissions, mitigating this issue.
    - Multiple nodes transmitting simultaneously provide a power gain, increasing the system capacity.
  - Reduction in throughput at the single-antenna node is less than 3%.
  - Residual interference after alignment (1.3 dB) does not significantly impact throughput.

## 4. Performance with Different Transmit and Receive Antennas
### 4.1 Experiment Setup
- **Scenario**: As in Figure 4, with a 2-antenna access point (AP1) receiving from a single-antenna client (c1), and a 3-antenna AP (AP2) transmitting to two 2-antenna clients.
- **Comparison**: Throughput of n+ with 802.11n and beamforming [7].

### 4.2 Results
- **Figure 13**: Plots the CDFs of n+â€™s throughput gains in comparison with 802.11n and beamforming.
- **Key Observations**:
  - Total network throughput increases by 2.4x over 802.11n and 1.8x over beamforming.
  - Single-antenna client experiences a negligible reduction in throughput (3.2%).
  - Other clients experience throughput gains of 3.5-3.6x over 802.11n and 2.5-2.6x over beamforming.
  - Large gains are due to more concurrent transmissions and providing multi-antenna nodes more opportunities to transmit concurrently with the single-antenna transmitter.

## 5. Related Work
- **MIMO Networks**: Recent research has focused on virtual MIMO and interference alignment, leading to systems like beamforming, SAM, and IAC.
- **n+ Advantages**: Unlike previous systems, n+ does not require a centralized coordinator and provides a fully distributed random access protocol.
- **Theoretical Foundations**: Builds on multi-user MIMO, interference alignment, and cognitive MIMO, but focuses on a random access protocol where nodes do not need explicit coordination.

## 6. Conclusion
- **n+**: A random access protocol for heterogeneous MIMO networks that significantly improves network throughput.
- **Future Potential**: As device diversity increases, n+ is well-positioned to exploit these differences and provide better utilization of network resources.
