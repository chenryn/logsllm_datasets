When I define a custom undo behaviour I found it become different between
Windows and Mac devices.
This is what I did:
    // the main menu I overwrite:
    let menuTemplate = [
      // Edit
      {
        label: 'Edit',
        submenu: [
          {
            label: 'Undo',
            accelerator: 'CmdOrCtrl+Z',
            click () {
              console.log('Undo');
            }
          },
          {
            label: 'Redo',
            accelerator: 'Shift+CmdOrCtrl+Z',
            click () {
              console.log('Redo');
            }
          },
        ]
      }
    ];
As you can see, I overwrite the Undo behaviour and use the same shortcuts from
the Browser. When I press `ctrl/cmd+z` on Mac, things goes fine, the menu
click go first and take over it. But in Windows, it seems like the original
`webContents.undo()` will be executed first, if the undo stack have states
(which means you should typing some letters on a `` first).
This makes me have no chance to overwrite the undo for Windows platform. Is
this expect in Windows? If we can not change the menu behaviour, is there a
way to disable/stop `webContents.undo` when pressing `ctrl+z` so that the Main
Menu can receive it?
