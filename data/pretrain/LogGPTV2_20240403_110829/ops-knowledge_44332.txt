User: What is container technology? How is it different from virtualization technology? Please provide an application scenario of a Docker container.
Assistant: Container technology is a lightweight virtualization technology that can package applications and their dependencies into an independent executable software, so as to achieve cross-platform, fast deployment, flexible and portable features, while saving hardware resources and System overhead. Compared with traditional virtualization technology, container technology does not require a complete operating system image, but shares the host operating system, which can be more lightweight, fast start and consume less resources. In addition, container technology can also achieve advantages such as self-management, elastic scaling, continuous integration and rapid deployment. The application scenario of a Docker container can be: during the development and testing process, you can use the Docker container to build a clean, independent test environment, test quickly and consistently, and reduce errors and inconsistencies in the deployment and configuration process; In the production environment, Docker containers can be used to deploy and run applications, which is not only more efficient and reliable, but also can be rapidly expanded to better meet business needs.
