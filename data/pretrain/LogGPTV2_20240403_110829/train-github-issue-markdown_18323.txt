I have tested this input code in chrome and your compiled code also and
discovered an issue. I have described that issue in the comments in the
following code.
    class B extends RegExp {
      constructor(source, flags) {
        super(source, flags);
      }
      getName() {
        return 'name';
      }
    }
    new B('test', 'i').test('TeSt') // is true as should be
    new B('test', 'i').test('TeSt') // throws error but should be "name"
