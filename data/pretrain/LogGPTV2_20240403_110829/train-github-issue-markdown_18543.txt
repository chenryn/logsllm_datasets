##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.1.0.0
      config file = /path/to/whatever/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
    [ssh_connection]
    pipelining=True
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY
Unix domain socket created by ansible was too long, therefore ssh fails.  
The error message is very vague:
    this-is-a-long-hostname.example.org | UNREACHABLE! => {
        "changed": false,
        "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh.",
        "unreachable": true
    }
Giving the same ssh command as ansible, the error was more descriptive:
    unix_listener: "/Users/user12/.ansible/cp/ansible-ssh-this-is-a-long-hostname.example.org-1022-user12345.ulAxrSDBy3jA13KO" too long for Unix domain socket
I was able to solve this by putting in my `ansible.cfg`
    control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
The socket name that ansible sets is clearly way too long. This means that, as
of now, long hostnames don't work with Ansible, and it can be quite
restricting.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
  * Have a long hostname in your inventory (e.g. `this-is-a-long-hostname.example.org`)
  * Try a simple ping command (with `ansible -vvvvvvvvvvvvv -m ping` to that host)
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
You can connect to the machine
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
  * You cannot connect to the machine
  * SSH error is very vague (maybe addressed by #16649 )
