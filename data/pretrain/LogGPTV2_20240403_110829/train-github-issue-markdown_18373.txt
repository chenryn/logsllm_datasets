We should add some basic synchronization around multiple processes creating
the node_modules folder at the same time. Basically do whatever `cargo build`
does and have each process wait on the other.
This is necessary because it seems like multiple processes creating junctions
at the same time causes some weird issues with the junctions becoming invalid.
Also, it's duplicate work for the two processes to do this.
Edit: I have the code done for this... just need to write a test.
