**Abstract:**
Decomposition is a common strategy for managing system complexity, but it poses challenges for emergent properties such as system safety. In our previous work, we introduced Indirect Control Path Analysis (ICPA) to elaborate on system safety goals in composite systems. In this paper, we provide mathematical definitions of emergent and composable system behaviors in the context of formal specifications and ICPA. We also identify useful special cases where partial decomposition of emergent safety goals is possible. We apply ICPA to a semi-autonomous automotive system to identify safety goals for key subsystems and then monitor these goals at runtime in a vehicle implementation. Although false negatives at the subsystem level indicate that the subgoals do not fully compose the original safety goal, some system-level goal violations are detected by subsystem monitors. Additionally, monitoring at both the system and subsystem levels has identified certain safety-related errors that may be imperceptible to system testers.

**1. Introduction**
In distributed embedded systems, a common strategy for managing complexity is to divide the system into functional subsystems. Each subsystem is then designed and developed separately, often by different groups within a company or by external vendors. For example, in a distributed automotive system, different controllers may handle engine, transmission, and stability algorithms, each with its own set of requirements describing its functional behavior.

Unfortunately, decomposing non-functional requirements, also known as goals [8] or quality attributes [12, 2], is not straightforward. Quantifiable goals, such as cost or performance, can be decomposed by allocating fixed limits to each component [22]. However, system safety, defined by Leveson as "freedom from accidents or losses" [17], is usually not expressible as a sum of parts. Consider an automotive safety goal: "the vehicle shall experience zero collisions." Unlike performance goals, where the concept of "time" is the same for components and the system, the concept of "collision" at the system level does not have the same meaning for individual components. These properties are said to be emergent [20].

In our previous work [5], we introduced Indirect Control Path Analysis (ICPA) to elaborate on system safety goals across a composite system. Safety goals were defined for a semi-autonomous automotive system from a commercial automotive research lab, featuring five active safety/driver convenience features: Collision Avoidance (CA), Rear Collision Avoidance (RCA), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lane Change Assist (LCA), and Park Assist (PA). ICPA was then applied to identify safety goals for each feature subsystem and the subsystem that arbitrates among features. Other vehicle subsystems were excluded from the analysis, but the technique could be applied to them as well.

This initial work provided a set of subgoals, but it was unknown whether these subgoals were sufficient to satisfy the original parent goal. If a vehicle's safety goals are indeed emergent, it may not be possible to identify all subgoals that meet the parent goal. However, the set of safety subgoals produced with ICPA may still be useful if it is possible to partition an emergent safety goal into two parts: one part that is composable and another that is emergent.

In this paper, we define emergent and composable behaviors in the context of formally specified goals and ICPA, and identify useful special cases where emergent system goals may be partially composable. To evaluate the technique, runtime monitors for the semi-autonomous automotive system's safety goals and sub-goals were added to a vehicle implementation in a simulation environment. False negative detection at the subsystem level in some scenarios suggests that the set of subsystem safety goals does not fully satisfy the system-level behavior. In such cases, the system safety goal may be a truly emergent property, detectable only at the system level.
