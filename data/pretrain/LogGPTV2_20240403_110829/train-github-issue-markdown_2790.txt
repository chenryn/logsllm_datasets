  1. You do some entries into the HTML form
  2. submits the form
  3. you do some changes to the form's entries on the server side
  4. the changes are not displayed to the user, old entries remind in the form
Probably the bug is here:
in the Constructor of the org.springframework.web.servlet.support.BindStatus  
it is  
=>  
...  
this.errors = requestContext.getErrors(beanName, false);  
if (this.errors != null) {  
...  
} else {  
...  
}  
=>  
the requestContext.getErrors returns errors Object that is not null but empty
so (this.errors.hasErrors() is false)  
the else block is NEVER EXECUTED !!!
The solution could be:  
=>  
if (this.errors != null && this.errors.hasErrors()) {  
...  
} else {  
...  
}  
=>
