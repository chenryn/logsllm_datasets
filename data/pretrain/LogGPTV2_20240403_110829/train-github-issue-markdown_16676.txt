Subject: Inquiry Regarding Porting `RectifiedAdam` with `exclude_from_weight_decay` Extension

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am interested in porting the `RectifiedAdam` optimizer from **tensorflow/addons** and adding an `exclude_from_weight_decay` extension. For more details, please refer to [issue #2681](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/issues/2681) on the TensorFlow Addons GitHub repository.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
