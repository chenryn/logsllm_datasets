User: I Have add some wrong task to a celery with redis broker
but now I want to remove the incorrect task and I can't find any way to do this
Is there some commands or some api to do this ?
Assistant: The simplest way is to use the celery control revoke [id1 [id2 [... [idN]]]] (do not forget to pass the -A project.application flag too). Where id1 to idN are task IDs. However, it is not guaranteed to succeed every time you run it, for valid reasons...
Sure Celery has API for it. Here is an example how to do it from a script: res = app.control.revoke(task_id, terminate=True)
In the example above app is an instance of the Celery application.
In some rare ocasions the control command above will not work, in which case you have to instruct Celery worker to kill the worker process: res = app.control.revoke(task_id, terminate=True, signal='SIGKILL')
