User: What measures can be taken to harden the security of the MySQL database on a certain server? Please list at least three.
Assistant: 1. Change the default port number: Change the default port 3306 of MySQL to another port number to prevent attackers from using known ports to attack. 2. Restrict remote access: Only specific IP addresses or network segments are allowed to connect to the MySQL database, which can reduce unauthorized access and attacks. 3. Strengthen the password policy: set complex passwords and require regular password changes to prevent malicious attacks from gaining access to the database through brute force cracking. 4. Set access control: For different users, set different access rights to avoid unnecessary access behaviors and prevent data leakage and damage. 5. Regular data backup: regular backup of database data can ensure that in the event of a failure or attack, the data can be restored as soon as possible and the loss can be reduced. 6. Enable SSL/TLS encryption: Enable SSL/TLS encryption technology to ensure the security of database connections and prevent sensitive information from being intercepted.
