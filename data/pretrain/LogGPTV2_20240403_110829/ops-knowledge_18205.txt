User: This question has been asked a few times, but the remedy appears to complicated enough that I'm still searching for a user specific solution. I recently re-installed anaconda; now, after entering
     "pip install splinter" 
in the Terminal on my Mac I get the response: 
    "Requirement already satisfied: splinter in      /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Requirement already satisfied: selenium>=2.53.6 in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from splinter)"
But, I get the following error in python (Anaconda) after entering import splinter
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
    import splinter
ImportError: No module named splinter"
When I enter which python in the terminal, this is the output: "/usr/local/bin/python"
I am editing the question here to add the solution: ~/anaconda2/bin/pip install splinter
Assistant: I had the same issue, I uninstalled and reinstalled splinter many times but that didn't work. Then I typed source activate (name of my conda environment) and then did pip install splinter. It worked for me.
