User: I have a subprocess that I use. I must be able to asynchronously read and write to/from this process to it's respective stdout and stdin.
How can I do this? I have looked at subprocess, but the communicate method waits for process termination (which is not what I want) and the subprocess.stdout.read method can block.
The subprocess is not a Python script but can be edited if absolutely necessary. In total I will have around 15 of these subprocesses.
Assistant: Have you considered using some queue or NOSQL DB for inter process communication?
I would suggest you to use Redis, and read and write to different keys with your processes.
