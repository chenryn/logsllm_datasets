User: I've set up PyCharm, created my virtualenv (either through the virtual env command, or directly in PyCharm) and activated that environment as my Interpreter. Everything is working just fine.
However, if I open a terminal using "Tools, Open Terminal", the shell prompt supplied is not using the virtual env; I still have to use source ~/envs/someenv/bin/activate within that Terminal to activate it.
Another method is to activate the environment in a shell, and run PyCharm from that environment. This is "workable" but pretty ugly, and means I have major problems if I switch environments or projects from PyCharm: I'm now using the totally-wrong environment.
Is there some other, much-easier way to have "Tools, Open Terminal" automatically activate the virtual environment?
Assistant: I have a solution that worked on my Windows 7 machine.
I believe PyCharm's terminal is a result of it running cmd.exe, which will load the Windows PATH variable, and use the version of Python that it finds first within that PATH. To edit this variable, right click My Computer --> Properties --> Advanced System Settings --> Advanced tab --> Environment Variables... button. Within the System variables section, select and edit the PATH variable.
Here is the relevant part of my PATH before editing:

C:\Python27\;
  C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pip\;
  C:\Python27\Scripts;
  C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\django\bin;

...and after editing PATH (only 3 lines now):

C:[project_path]\virtualenv-Py2.7_Dj1.7\Lib\site-packages\pip;
  C:[project_path]\virtualenvs\virtualenv-Py2.7_Dj1.7\Scripts;
  C:[project_path]\virtualenvs\virtualenv-Py2.7_Dj1.7\Lib\site-packages\django\bin;

To test this, open a new windows terminal (Start --> type in cmd and hit Enter) and see if it's using your virtual environment. If that works, restart PyCharm and then test it out in PyCharm's terminal.
