Question: "If a malicious app defines a widely-used but potentially dangerous permission name with 'normal' level before any legitimate app does, which of the following could be potential consequences? Choose the correct outcomes based on the Android permission system:"
 "A": "The malicious app's definition of the permission takes precedence, and any subsequent app requesting this permission will be granted it without alerting the user, due to the 'normal' level assigned."
 "B": "All apps that define the permission after the malicious app will have the 'dangerous' level ignored, as the permission level has already been set by the first registration."
 "C": "The malicious app would be prevented from defining an existing dangerous permission as 'normal' due to built-in protection mechanisms in the Android operating system."
 "D": "Legitimate apps will prompt the user for approval despite the permission being registered as 'normal', because the system recognizes the permission's inherent risks."
Answer: AB
