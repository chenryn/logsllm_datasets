Whenever I try to open Dialog from Drawer, the Dialog shows up for very short
time and disappears.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Dialog shows up while the Drawer slides back in the background.
## Current Behavior
After clicking an ListItemText in the drawer with function to open the dialog
passed to it's onClick prop, the dialog shows up and the drawer starts to
slide off as it is supposed to do. When the drawer slides off completely, the
dialog disappears too.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Create a component containing  (inside ) and . Bind function to open the dialog to listitemtext prop onClick.
  2. Import this component into  that is inside 
Now you can open the dialog by clicking on list item in the drawer.

## Context
I am react newbie but I am pretty sure that is problem caused by this
framework.  
I do not know how these components works, but from the behavior I guess when
the Drawer stops rendering, the Dialog stops aswell as it is directly in it.
