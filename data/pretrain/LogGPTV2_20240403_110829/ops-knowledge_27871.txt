User: Suppose I have python script having having 4-5 functions all are called from single function in a script. If I want to results after executing script( Use functions from another script)  I can make script executable and use subprocess.popen and I can also import these functions in another script. Which is better way to do this?
Assistant: If you want to use functions from an other script then you usually import the script.
When the script is script.py you can write import script and use the functions that are defined in the script with script.function_in_the_script.
