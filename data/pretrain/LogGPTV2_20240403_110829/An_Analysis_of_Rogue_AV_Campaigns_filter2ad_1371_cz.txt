### Number of Anomalous Dimensions for the S-Vector

The number of anomalous dimensions in the S-Vector is a parameter that can be used to rank potential query anomalies. Queries with more anomalous S-Vector dimensions are ranked higher as likely candidates for possible attacks. This approach is utilized for testing a custom-developed anomaly set, where normal queries from Chair and Faculty roles are used to compute the mean values of S-Vector attributes. Three times the standard deviation is used as the threshold to identify anomalies.

### Performance Results

A typical performance result for two user roles (Chair and Faculty) and their corresponding anomalous query sets is shown in Table 4. 

### Cluster-Based Outlier Detection Algorithm Performance

Several points are worth noting regarding the performance of the cluster-based outlier detection algorithm:
- As expected, syntax-based schemes perform poorly because they are inherently blind to Type 2b anomalies.
- The detection rate for the S-Vector (all) is reasonable at 83.87%.
- However, the Initial-k approximation's accuracy is significantly lower. Upon closer inspection, it was found that many user queries extensively use the SQL ORDER-BY clause, making the Initial-k statistics unrepresentative of the overall result set. This issue is partially mitigated by the Random-k variation (e.g., for random k = 20, the detection rate improves to 67.7%). Despite this, there is still a marked decline in performance, indicating that the clustering scheme is sensitive to the approximation methods and negatively affected by them.
- Further analysis suggests that clustering may not be the best choice for detecting Type 2b anomalies due to the curse of dimensionality. High-dimensional Euclidean distances can be misleading indicators of anomalies, as a highly anomalous value along a single dimension may not translate to a significant Euclidean cluster-distance.

### Attrib-Deviation Scheme Performance

The results for the Attrib-Deviation scheme are much better:
- Syntax-based schemes still perform poorly as expected.
- Data-centric schemes, including Attrib-Deviation, have detection rates close to 87%, which is better than the cluster-based schemes.
- A key finding is that the attribute-deviation schemes are resilient to the approximation method. Both Initial-k and Random-k perform well, with the Initial-k performing unexpectedly well even with queries generating specific ordering of results.

### Resiliency and Accuracy of Attrib-Deviation

The resiliency and accuracy of Attrib-Deviation can be explained as follows:
- A single anomalous attribute in the result corresponds to variations in multiple dimensions of the S-Vector, each representing a statistical measurement. The extent of the anomaly may vary between result attributes.
- Selective ordering (e.g., by SQL ORDER-BY clauses) may offer a skewed view of overall result statistics, but Attrib-Deviation operates on a per-attribute basis and can still identify anomalies.
- Many queries have more than one anomalous attribute, so selective ordering may mask anomalies in some attributes but not all.
- Selective ordering may not affect all statistical measurements of a single attribute equally (e.g., it may affect Max but not Median). For very low k (k = 5), Initial-k performance drops, but Random-k still offers reasonable performance.

### Practical Implications

The good performance of the Initial-k approximation with this detection technique has several practical implications:
- It indicates that a fast online anomaly detector can perform well by considering just a few initial output tuples.
- Randomized sampling of query results may not be feasible in general, especially for queries generating hundreds or thousands of output tuples. However, our results suggest that accuracy may not always need to be sacrificed.
- The S-Vector representation scheme and attribute-deviation based anomaly detection algorithm are resilient to attacks designed to mislead or bypass detection. It is very difficult for an attacker to craft queries that control multiple statistical measurements.

### False Positive Rates

On the downside, the false positive rates for the Attrib-Deviation schemes are still too high. Reducing false-positive rates while maintaining or increasing true positive rates is an important research question that we plan to address in future work.

### Concluding Remarks and Future Work

#### Query Construction
- S-vectors are constructed by expressing the schema of each query result in terms of the attributes of the base schema. For select-project-join (SPJ) queries on base relations, the base schema is easily determined. When SPJ queries are expressed on top of views, the view unfolding technique is employed to determine the base schema.
- For more complex queries, such as union queries, it is not clear if the base schema can be determined. We plan to investigate data provenance techniques to revise the definition and use of the S-vector.

#### Dynamic Databases
- The framework assumes a static database, but we plan to extend our work to dynamic databases. The first challenge is to determine when updates shift the boundary between normal and abnormal queries. If the database instance is updated significantly, classifiers become obsolete, and re-training is necessary.
- For less dynamic databases, such as OLAP databases, it is possible to apply the data-centric approach depending on the relative frequency between re-training and data updates.

#### Activity Context
- The context of a userâ€™s activity is a set of query results generated in the past by the same user or the group they belong to. We plan to investigate richer activity contexts, including session statistics, temporal and spatial correlations of query results, and other factors.

#### Performance
- In cases where user queries return a large number of results, computing statistics over the entire query result for anomaly detection is impractical. The initial-k approximation can help improve performance without sacrificing too much accuracy.
- Another potential improvement is to design a new statistical model combining both syntax-based and data-centric approaches. In cases where the syntax-based approach gives a true positive, the data-centric engine can be skipped to avoid unnecessary database execution.
- Although random-k does not markedly outperform initial-k in our experiments, we expect it to perform consistently for a wider range of datasets and queries. Sampling a query result without computing the complete result is a hard problem, and we plan to leverage prior work on approximate query answering.

In conclusion, the techniques presented and analyzed in this paper show significant potential as practical solutions for anomaly detection and insider threat mitigation in database systems.
