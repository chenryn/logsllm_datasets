Abstract—End-to-end ﬂow correlation attacks are among the
oldest known attacks on low-latency anonymity networks, and
are treated as a core primitive for trafﬁc analysis of Tor.
However, despite recent work showing that individual ﬂows
can be correlated with high accuracy,
the impact of even
these state-of-the-art attacks is questionable due to a central
drawback: their pairwise nature, requiring comparison between
N 2 pairs of ﬂows to deanonymize N users. This results in
a combinatorial explosion in computational requirements and
an asymptotically declining base rate,
leading to either high
numbers of false positives or vanishingly small rates of successful
correlation. In this paper, we introduce a novel ﬂow correlation
attack, DeepCoFFEA, that combines two ideas to overcome these
drawbacks. First, DeepCoFFEA uses deep learning to train a pair
of feature embedding networks that respectively map Tor and
exit ﬂows into a single low-dimensional space where correlated
ﬂows are similar; pairs of embedded ﬂows can be compared
at lower cost than pairs of full traces. Second, DeepCoFFEA
uses ampliﬁcation, dividing ﬂows into short windows and using
voting across these windows to signiﬁcantly reduce false positives;
the same embedding networks can be used with an increasing
number of windows to independently lower the false positive
rate. We conduct a comprehensive experimental analysis showing
that DeepCoFFEA signiﬁcantly outperforms state-of-the-art ﬂow
correlation attacks on Tor, e.g. 93% true positive rate versus
at most 13% when tuned for high precision, with two orders
of magnitude speedup over prior work. We also consider the
effects of several potential countermeasures on DeepCoFFEA,
ﬁnding that existing lightweight defenses are not sufﬁcient to
secure anonymity networks from this threat.
I. INTRODUCTION
Tor is perhaps the most well-known anonymous network,
used by millions of people each day [1] to hide their sensitive
internet activities from servers, ISPs, and potentially, nation-
state adversaries. Tor provides low-latency anonymity by rout-
ing trafﬁc through a series of relays using layered encryption
to prevent any single entity from learning the source and
destination of a connection through its content alone.
Nevertheless, it is well known that in low-latency anonymity
networks, the timing and volume of trafﬁc sent between the
network and end systems (clients and servers) can be used
for trafﬁc analysis. For example, recent work applying trafﬁc
analysis to Tor has focused on website ﬁngerprinting [2]–[9],
identifying which website a client has downloaded based on
the trafﬁc between the client and the entry relay.
Perhaps the most fundamental trafﬁc analysis attack on a
low-latency anonymity system is the end-to-end ﬂow corre-
lation attack: an adversary observes trafﬁc ﬂows entering the
network and leaving the network and attempts to correlate
these ﬂows, thereby pairing each user with a likely destination.
Such attacks were known and discussed in the context of
system designs that predate Tor, such as the Onion Routing
network [10] and the Freedom network [11].
The Tor design [12] explicitly acknowledges that such
attacks can be effective and concentrates on a more limited
threat model. In turn, many published analyses of the security
of Tor treat ﬂow correlation as a core primitive and simply
account for the fraction of ﬂows that can be observed by an
adversary [13]–[24]. These works typically describe methods
to increase or limit the fraction of ﬂows that an adversary can
observe through some combination of internal manipulation of
Tor protocols, manipulation of the Internet routing infrastruc-
ture, or network positioning and resources, and assume that
ﬂow correlation will work on these observations.
Despite these assumptions, the extent to which end-to-end
ﬂow correlation attacks are a realistic threat against the Tor
network remains unclear. A problem with directly applying
these attacks to Tor trafﬁc is that trafﬁc between the client
and entry relay is not identical to trafﬁc between the exit
relay and the destination server, due to a variety of factors:
multiplexing of encrypted trafﬁc; the use of ﬁxed-size cells
to carry data between Tor nodes; and delays caused by
buffering, congestion, interaction between circuits, and Tor’s
ﬂow control mechanisms. For example, when Sun et al. [17]
applied Spearman’s rank correlation to a small set of entry
ﬂows (called Tor ﬂows since they are wrapped in the Tor cell
protocol), they found that nearly 100MB of trafﬁc per ﬂow
was needed to get adequate performance. Nasr, Bahramali,
and Houmansadr [25] addressed this limitation by using deep
neural networks (DNNs) to learn a more effective Tor-speciﬁc
ﬂow correlation metric, DeepCorr, that classiﬁes pairs of ﬂows
as correlated or uncorrelated with very high accuracy using
much less trafﬁc.
Another fundamental limitation, however, on the end-to-end
correlation of Tor ﬂows is the pairwise nature of the attack.
To decide if a ﬂow entering the Tor network and one leaving
it are on the same Tor connection, these attacks compute the
correlation between the two ﬂow vectors (consisting of packet
times and sizes); to deanonymize a set of ﬂows, the attacks
must compute the correlation between all possible incoming
and outgoing ﬂows. Thus, to deanonymize N Tor connections,
they will perform N 2 comparisons.

(TPs) and potential false positives (FPs).
We call the resulting attack DeepCoFFEA, for Deep Corre-
lated Flow Feature Extraction and Ampliﬁcation.1 To sketch
our attack at a high level, the network-level adversary monitors
Tor ﬂows ti, between clients and entry guards, and exit ﬂows
xj, between exit relays and destination servers, by running
its own relays or controlling autonomous systems (ASes) as
shown in Figure 1. After extracting packet timing and size
information, the adversary jointly trains two DNN models (G
and H) in which Tor ﬂows and exit ﬂows are used as inputs,
respectively; G and H should have the property that if Tor
ﬂow t and exit ﬂow x are correlated, then d(G(t), H(x)) ≥ τ
for some correlation metric d and threshold τ, but if they are
not correlated, then d(G(t), H(x)) < τ. Then, the adversary
applies G and H to k consecutive ﬂow windows to extract
feature embedding vectors and computes the pairwise correla-
tion matrix. Finally, if two ﬂows are seen as correlated by d in
at least k − (cid:96) windows (for a small threshold (cid:96)), the adversary
determines that the ﬂows are correlated, and otherwise they
are not; this exponentially ampliﬁes the difference in TPs and
FPs.
Even though both DeepCorr and DeepCoFFEA both per-
form pairwise correlation, DeepCoFFEA is much more efﬁ-
cient, since G and H generate a total of 2kN embedding
vectors, while DeepCorr deals with N 2 pairs. This is because
DeepCoFFEA compares the embedding vectors for each pair
of ﬂows using inexpensive distance computations, while Deep-
Corr performs expensive DNN evaluations based on pairwise
information about the Tor and exit ﬂows together.
This improved strategy enables DeepCoFFEA to simul-
taneously decrease the required computing resources while
increasing the BDR compared to DeepCorr. For instance,
when performing a correlation analysis among 10,000 ﬂows,
DeepCoFFEA detects an order of magnitude more true corre-
lated pairs (85% vs 8% TPR) for a given FPR (10−4), while
decreasing the compute time by two orders of magnitude. We
also show that the effectiveness of DeepCoFFEA can be trans-
ferable across destinations, circuits, and time; in particular,
DeepCoFFEA was able to effectively correlate ﬂows on an
evaluation dataset that was collected 14 months apart from
its training dataset. We also show that, due to ampliﬁcation,
DeepCoFFEA can learn enough useful features to correlate
ﬂows that have been protected by unknown padding defenses.
Combined with the DeepCorr results and recent advances in
website ﬁngerprinting [5], these results show an urgent need to
develop and deploy trafﬁc analysis countermeasures to protect
the users of Tor.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Flow Correlation Attacks
We ﬁrst review past end-to-end ﬂow correlation studies in
Appendix A. Then, we discuss more recent ﬂow correlation
techniques, RAPTOR and DeepCorr, which we call state-of-
the-art attacks in this paper and compare to DeepCoFFEA.
1We pronounce it “Deep Coffee.”

controls ISPs (blue) and the other runs their own relays (red).
Naturally, this is computationally expensive when the num-
ber of ﬂows at a given moment can be in the tens of thousands.
Perhaps more critically, the pairwise comparison results in
poor Bayesian Detection Rates (BDRs), since the base rate
– the probability that both ends of a Tor connection are
N ). Any correlation metric with
correlated – is very low (i.e., 1
a ﬁxed False Positive Rate (FPR) of ρ will incorrectly classify
ρN exit ﬂows as being correlated with each entry ﬂow, so
that the probability that a given pair is actually correlated
given that the metric classiﬁes them that way is
1+ρN , which
approaches 0 as N increases.

This paper presents a novel approach that (i) signiﬁcantly
reduces the cost for each of these comparisons by using a
modiﬁed triplet network approach [26] that ﬁrst embeds both
Tor ﬂows and exit ﬂows into a low-dimensional space, and
then uses much more efﬁcient comparisons between these
embeddings; and (ii) uses ampliﬁcation [27] to aggregate
multiple comparisons for each pair of ﬂows, allowing the FPR
to be signiﬁcantly reduced without the need to learn a new
