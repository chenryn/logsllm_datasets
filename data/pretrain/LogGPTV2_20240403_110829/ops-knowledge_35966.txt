User: How to avoid common security holes when writing python scripts?
Assistant: Here are some practical suggestions for avoiding common security holes: 1. Avoid using the eval() function and exec statements, as they may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. 2. Avoid using untrusted user input to be directly spliced into SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Parameterized queries or escape characters should be used. 3. Avoid using the pickle module to serialize and deserialize untrusted data, as it may allow an attacker to execute malicious code. 4. When using web applications, ensure proper validation and filtering of all inputs to avoid cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). 5. Use the HTTPS protocol for communication to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping. 6. Encrypt and store passwords and sensitive data in a safe place. 7. Regularly update and patch third-party libraries and components to avoid known vulnerabilities. 8. When writing code, follow the principle of least privilege, and assign appropriate permissions to different users and roles. 9. Conduct security audits and vulnerability scans on the code, and fix the problems found. 10. Always stay updated and vigilant, and deal with security breaches in a timely manner.
