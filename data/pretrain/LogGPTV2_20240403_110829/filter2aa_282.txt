Like a Boss
 Open source Java EE application server
 Developed by JBoss, a division of Red Hat
 Abstracts the infrastructure of Java-based 
web applications
 Very large and complex
 “We have over the years had the understanding that JBoss 
AS will be primarily used by Java EE developers on their 
desktop to develop business applications. When they are 
ready to deploy those applications in production, they will 
have the practical sense to follow guidelines on securing 
jboss (which has been available in multiple forms in our 
wiki).
There are no reasonable defaults in security to secure the 
shipped community version of JBoss AS.”

 Provides a web interface to MBeans
 From the JBoss wiki:
 Installed by default with no security
 JBoss provides recommendations for securing 
the JMX Console
◦ Some of which have been proven wrong
◦ And some issues are simply not addressed
 http://community.jboss.org/wiki/securethejmxconsole
 Default login module in login-config.xml is:
◦ org.jboss.security.auth.spi.UsersRolesLoginModule
 This module does not provide 
◦ Enforced password complexity
◦ Password lockouts
◦ Etc.
 Notice anything?
HtmlAdaptor
An example security config
that only allows users with the
role JBossAdmin to access the HTML JMX
console web application
/*
GET
POST
 Persistent XSS – get admin JSESSIONID
 CSRF – execute any functionality
 Specify the module used for authentication 
per application
 jboss.security:service=XMLLoginConfig
 Load new login-config.xml from arbitrary 
URL
 MBeans are exposed over RMI
 Same functionality as JMX console
 DIFFERENT authentication mechanism!
 JBoss also recommends you secure this
 Occasionally the JMX console is protected or 
absent, but this service is available
 Twiddle
 /web-console/Invoker
 /invoker/JMXInvokerServlet
 Use deployment mechanisms to deploy 
arbitrary code
◦ Deploy over HTTP
◦ BeanShell Deployer
 JBoss 4 and lower
 Upload a JSP to an existing app
 Reported in 2006 and “fixed” 
 Directory traversal is not the real issue
 JBoss 5.x IS vulnerable
 Note that DeploymentFileRepository is part of 
the web console, not JMX console
 Often available even when JMX console or RMI 
service is not
 It’s just status, right?
 Don’t put secret tokens into URLs
 From Google cache
 And other interesting things
