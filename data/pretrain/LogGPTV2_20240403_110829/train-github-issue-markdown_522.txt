**Original Ticket:** http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/648 (Reported on 2008-01-21 by @chanley, assigned to unknown)

**Issue Description:**

The following code snippet causes a bus error on a big-endian machine (specifically, Solaris 10 Sun in this case):

```python
Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jun 29 2007, 15:29:55) [C] on sunos5
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>> import numpy
>>>> o = numpy.ndarray(shape=3, dtype=[('SEGMENT', '|S4'), ('SPEC_FOUND', '|i1')])
>>>> o1 = o.getfield(numpy.dtype('|S4'), 0)
>>>> print(o1[0])
UXÐ
>>>> print(o1[1])
4
>>>> print(o1[2])
NT
>>>> print(o1)
Bus error (core dumped)
```

**Observations:**
- The issue does not occur on little-endian machines such as Linux or Mac OS X (Intel-based systems).
- This example was tested using the latest SVN version of NumPy (r1.0.5.dev47360).

**Environment:**
- **Operating System:** Solaris 10 Sun
- **Python Version:** 2.5.1
- **NumPy Version:** r1.0.5.dev47360

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Import the `numpy` module.
2. Create a NumPy array with a structured data type.
3. Use the `getfield` method to extract a field from the array.
4. Print the individual elements of the extracted field.
5. Attempt to print the entire extracted field, which results in a bus error.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The `print(o1)` statement should output the entire array without causing a bus error.

**Actual Behavior:**
- A bus error occurs when attempting to print the entire `o1` array.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is specific to big-endian architectures and does not affect little-endian systems.

This ticket aims to address the bus error and ensure compatibility across different endianness configurations.
