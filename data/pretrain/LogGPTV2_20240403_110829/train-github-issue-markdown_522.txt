The following will cause a bus error on a big endian machine (Solaris 10 Sun
in this case):
    > Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jun 29 2007, 15:29:55) [C] on sunos5
    > Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>> import numpy
    >>>> o = numpy.ndarray(shape=3,dtype=[('SEGMENT', '|S4'), ('SPEC_FOUND', '|i1')])
    >>>> o1 = o.getfield(numpy.dtype('|S4'),0)
    >>>> print o1[0]
    > UXÐ
    >>>> print o1[1]
    > 4
    >>>> print o1[2]
    > NT
    >>>> print o1
    > Bus error (core dumped)
There are no issues on Linux or Mac OS X Intel based systems.
This example was done on the latest svn version of numpy (r1.0.5.dev47360).
