Hello,

I have been attempting to build PyTorch on Windows 10 Pro for about a week, but I am encountering significant difficulties. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or pointers that someone could provide.

Below are the commands I have used and the corresponding output:

### Commands
```batch
set "VS150COMNTOOLS=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build"
set CMAKE_GENERATOR=Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64
set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1

REM The following two lines are needed for Python 2.7, but support for it is very experimental.
set MSSdk=1
set FORCE_PY27_BUILD=1

REM For CUDA 8, VS2015 Update 3 is also required to build PyTorch. Use the following two lines.
set "PREBUILD_COMMAND=%VS140COMNTOOLS%....\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
set PREBUILD_COMMAND_ARGS=x64

call "%VS150COMNTOOLS%\vcvarsall.bat" x64 -vcvars_ver=14.15
python setup.py install
```

### Output
```
...

Thank you in advance for any help or suggestions!
