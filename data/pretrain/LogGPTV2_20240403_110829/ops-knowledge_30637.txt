User: hello to you all :)
i have a program that have a n number of threads(could be a lot) and they do a pretty extensive job. My problem is that sometimes some people turn off or reboot the server(the program runs all day  in the company servers) i know that there is a way to make a handler for the linux signals i want to know what  i should do to interact with all threads making them to use run a function and then stop working. There is a way to do that?
sorry the bad english :P
Assistant: About the only thing you can do is set a global variable from your signal handler, and have your threads check its value periodically.
