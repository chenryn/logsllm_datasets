User: Besides the fact that node.js is written in JS and Tornado in Python, what are some of the differences between the two?  They're both non-blocking asynchronous web servers, right?  Why choose one over the other besides the language?
Assistant: Nodejs also has a seamless integration / implementation of websockets called Socket.io. It handles browsers supporting sockets - events and also has backward polling compatibility for older browsers. It is quite quick on development requiring a notification framework or some similar event based programming.
