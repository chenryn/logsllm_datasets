Question: In the context of the APK Signature Scheme v4, you are evaluating the hashing parameters to be used. Select the most appropriate combination of hashing algorithm and block size, and identify the best counterargument to the claim that 'any hashing algorithm and block size can be used with v4 signatures'.
"A": "SHA256 with a block size of 4096; Counterargument: The scheme only supports SHA256 with a block size of 4096.",
"B": "SHA512 with a block size of 2048; Counterargument: The scheme supports multiple block sizes, but only SHA256 is supported as the hashing algorithm.",
"C": "MD5 with a block size of 1024; Counterargument: The scheme is flexible with hashing algorithms but requires a specific block size.",
"D": "SHA1 with a block size of 512; Counterargument: The scheme allows any block size as long as the hashing algorithm is SHA256."
Answer: A
