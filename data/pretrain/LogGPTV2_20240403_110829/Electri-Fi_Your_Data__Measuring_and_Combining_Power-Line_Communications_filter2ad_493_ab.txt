### Optimization of Text

**Introduction and Setup:**
- We configured the system with a 400 ns guard interval, achieving a maximum PHY rate of 130 Mbps. To avoid interference with other wireless networks in our building, we selected an appropriate frequency. The highest data rate for Power Line Communication (PLC) is 150 Mbps, ensuring that both interfaces (WiFi and PLC) have similar nominal capacities. This is confirmed by the maximum throughputs exhibited by both mediums, as shown in Figure 3.

**Experiment Design:**
- To evaluate the performance of both WiFi and PLC, we conducted an experiment where, for each pair of stations, we measured the available throughput of both mediums back-to-back for 5 minutes at 100 ms intervals. These experiments were carried out during working hours to emulate a realistic residential/enterprise environment. We present the average and standard deviation of these measurements (for links with non-zero throughput for at least one medium).

**Key Findings:**

1. **Connectivity:**
   - PLC provides better connectivity compared to WiFi. All station pairs connected via WiFi are also connected via PLC, while only 81% of station pairs connected by PLC are also connected by WiFi. At distances greater than 35 meters, WiFi loses connectivity, whereas PLC can still offer up to 41 Mbps. Thus, PLC significantly reduces blind spots.

2. **Average Performance:**
   - 52% of station pairs exhibit higher throughput with PLC than with WiFi. PLC can achieve up to 18 times higher throughput than WiFi (40.1 Mbps vs. 2.2 Mbps). Conversely, the maximum gain of WiFi over PLC was 12 times (46.3 Mbps vs. 3.8 Mbps).

3. **Variability:**
   - At short distances (less than 15 meters), WiFi generally provides higher throughput, but PLC offers significantly lower variance. The maximum standard deviation of throughput for WiFi is 19.2 Mbps, compared to 3.8 Mbps for PLC. Most PLC links have a standard deviation less than 4 Mbps.

**Conclusion:**
- At long distances, PLC eliminates wireless blind spots or bad links, providing notable gains. At short distances, although WiFi provides higher throughput, PLC offers significantly lower variance, which is beneficial for TCP or applications requiring a constant, high data rate, such as high-definition streaming. This difference is attributed to PLC's ability to adapt each carrier to a different modulation scheme, unlike WiFi, which must lower the rate for all carriers. PLC reacts more efficiently to bursty errors than WiFi.

**Spatial and Temporal Variation:**
- The spatial variation of WiFi has been extensively studied, but there is limited literature on PLC. Previous studies on PLC, such as [11], focus on older technology, and [13] treats PLC as a black box, focusing on average performance rather than variability. In this study, we explore the temporal variation of WiFi and PLC during working hours over a longer duration. Figure 4 shows the capacity for concurrent tests on WiFi and PLC, estimated using MCS and BLE, and averaged over 50 packets. We observe that link 3-8, a good link, exhibits much higher variation with WiFi than with PLC. Despite channel changes due to switching electrical appliances, the PLC link is almost unaffected by people leaving the premises around 6 PM. The average link 3-0 varies more for both mediums.

**Challenges in Hybrid Networks:**
- Although PLC enhances network performance, some links perform poorly with both WiFi and PLC. Mesh configurations, routing, and load balancing algorithms are necessary for seamless connectivity in home or office environments. A key challenge is dealing with two different interference graphs with diverse spatio-temporal variations. Accurate metrics for capacity and loss rates are required, and unicast probes must be exchanged among stations, introducing an O(n²) overhead that can be reduced by employing temporal variation studies of each medium.

**Link Metrics and Asymmetry:**
- Recent studies in 802.11n networks [16] highlight the need to revise established quality metrics like ETX or ETT, as they perform poorly in modern networks. This raises questions about how often PLC link metrics should be updated and how ETX would perform in PLC. We will address these questions in Sections 5–8.

**Spatial Variation of PLC:**
- We explore the spatial variation of PLC, which is crucial for predicting coverage and optimal locations for PLC stations. PLC is highly asymmetric, and this should be considered when estimating link metrics. The main properties affecting both spatial and temporal variations are attenuation and noise. Figure 5 illustrates a simple electrical network with a transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). The main sources of attenuation and noise are the electrical appliances, which create impedance mismatches and non-Gaussian noise. The spatial variation of PLC is influenced by the position, impedance, and number of connected appliances. Figure 7 shows the available UDP throughput of single links as a function of cable distance. Small distances (<30m) guarantee good links, but large distances (30-100m) can yield either good or bad links. AV500 enables some links with no AV connectivity to have non-zero throughput, but with severe asymmetries (e.g., link 10-2 with 10x asymmetry).

**Attenuation Experiments:**
- To further investigate attenuation, we conducted experiments with a long electrical cable and no devices attached. We found that attenuation in a 70 m cable causes a throughput drop of at most 2 Mbps. The attenuation is primarily due to the multi-path nature of the PLC channel. Plugging in electrical appliances in this isolated setup confirmed the impact of multi-path effects and noise.

**Summary:**
- Our findings indicate that PLC offers superior connectivity and lower variability, especially at long distances. However, it also presents challenges in hybrid networks, particularly in terms of asymmetry and the need for accurate link metrics. Future work will focus on refining these metrics and understanding the temporal variation of PLC.
