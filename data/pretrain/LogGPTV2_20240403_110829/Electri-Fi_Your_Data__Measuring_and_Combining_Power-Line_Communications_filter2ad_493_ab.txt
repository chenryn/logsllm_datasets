and 400 ns guard interval, yielding a maximum PHY rate of
130 Mbps. We selected a frequency that does not interfere
with other wireless networks in our building. The highest
PLC data-rate is 150 Mbps hence, both interfaces have sim-
ilar nominal capacities. This is conﬁrmed by the maximum
throughputs exhibited by both mediums, shown in Figure 3.
PLC can yield in situations with wireless “blind spots” or bad
links and also examines which medium an application should
use. We conduct the following experiment: For each pair of
stations, we measure the available throughput of both medi-
ums back-to-back for 5 minutes, at 100ms intervals. These
experiments are carried out during working hours to emulate
a realistic residential/enterprise environment. We show the
average and standard deviation of these measurements (for
links with a non-zero throughput for at least one medium).
Let TW and σW be, respectively, the average value and
standard deviation of throughput for WiFi (TP and σP , re-
spectively, for PLC). Figure 3 illustrates the results of our
experiment. Our key ﬁndings are as follows.
Connectivity: PLC yields a better connectivity than
WiFi. 100% of station pairs that are connected with WiFi
are also connected with PLC. In contrast, 81% of station
pairs that are connected by PLC links, are also connected
by WiFi links. At long distance (more than 35m), there is
no wireless connectivity whereas PLC oﬀers up to 41 Mbps.
Thus, PLC can eliminate, to a large extent, blind spots.
Average performance: 52% of the station pairs exhibit
throughput higher with PLC than with WiFi. PLC can
achieve throughput up to 18 times higher than WiFi (40.1 vs
2.2Mbps). The maximum gain of WiFi vs PLC was similar,
i.e., 12 times (46.3 vs 3.8Mbps).
Variability: At short distances (less than 15m), WiFi
usually yields higher throughput, but PLC oﬀers signiﬁcantly
lower variance. WiFi has higher variability with the maxi-
mum standard deviation of throughput being σW = 19.2
Mbps vs σP = 3.8 Mbps for PLC. The vast majority of PLC
links yield a σP smaller than 4 Mbps.
Conclusion: At long distances, PLC eliminates wireless
blind spots or bad links, yielding notable gains. At short
distances, although WiFi provides higher throughput, PLC
provides signiﬁcantly lower variance, which can be beneﬁcial
for TCP or applications with demanding, constant-rate re-
quirements, such as high-deﬁnition streaming. We explain
this diﬀerence by the ability of PLC to adapt each carrier
to a diﬀerent modulation scheme, contrary to WiFi (see Sec-
tion 2.1). PLC reacts more eﬃciently to bursty errors than
WiFi, which has to lower the rate at all carriers.
The spatial variation of WiFi has been extensively studied
(e.g., [14]). However, very few works exist on PLC; [11] fo-
cuses on a much older technology, and, due to the insuﬃcient
literature on speciﬁcations, [13] treats PLC as a black-box
and focuses on average performance and not on variability.
We next discuss the temporal variation of the two mediums.
4.2 Temporal Variation: WiFi vs PLC
We now look at the concurrent temporal variation of WiFi
and PLC during working hours for a much longer duration
than before. We are interested in exploring the timescales
at which the two mediums vary. Figure 4 shows the capacity
for concurrent tests on WiFi and PLC, estimated by using
MCS and BLE respectively, and averaged over 50 packets.
We observe that link 3-8, which is a good link, exhibits a
variation much higher with WiFi than with PLC. Although
we would expect channel changes due to switching electri-
cal appliances in the building, the PLC link is almost not
aﬀected by people leaving the premises (around 6pm). The
average link 3-0 varies more for both mediums.
These preliminary results imply that PLC has low variabil-
ity for good links and high for bad links. To the best of our

knowledge, there are not any temporal-variation studies of
the end-to-end performance of PLC. In contrast, many stud-
ies have focused on WiFi temporal variation. In Section 6,
we study the PLC temporal variation and we observe that
the variability is high in timescales of hours, because of the
variations of the electrical load. We notice however, that
this variation is not signiﬁcant, compared to the one of Wiﬁ,
and that it is high only for bad links.
4.3 Challenges in Hybrid Networks
As we observe in Section 4.1, although PLC boosts net-
work performance, there are still a few links that perform
poorly with both WiFi and PLC. As a result, mesh con-
ﬁgurations, hence routing and load balancing algorithms,
are needed for seamless connectivity in home or oﬃce en-
vironments. A challenge for these algorithms is that they
have to deal with two diﬀerent interference graphs with di-
verse spatio-temporal variation, and that, to fully exploit all
mediums, they require accurate metrics for capacity and loss
rates. To this end, unicast probes must be exchanged among
the stations6. In a network of n stations, probing introduces
an O(n2) overhead that can be signiﬁcantly reduced by em-
ploying temporal variation studies of each medium.
A signiﬁcant challenge, highlighted by recent studies in
802.11n networks [16], is the accuracy of established quality
metrics, such as the expected transmission count (ETX) or
time (ETT) [8], in modern networks, i.e., 802.11n/ac. The
authors in [16] show that due to the MAC/PHY enhance-
ments introduced in 802.11n, these metrics perform poorly
and that they should be revised, given that they have been
evaluated only under 802.11a/b/g.
The above arguments raise a few questions: How often
should the PLC link metrics, such as capacity, be updated
in load-balancing or routing algorithms in order to achieve
both small overhead and accurate estimation? How would
ETX perform in PLC? We will answer these questions in
Sections 5–8. In the rest of this work, we design link metrics
for PLC and explore their variation with respect not only to
time, but also to space and to background traﬃc.
5. SPATIAL VARIATION OF PLC
We explore the spatial variation of PLC, as it is important
for predicting coverage and good locations for PLC stations,
and for implementing link metrics. We ﬁnd that PLC is
highly asymmetric, and this should be considered when es-
timating link metrics.
We ﬁrst explain the main properties of the channel that
aﬀect both spatial and temporal variations. The two main
components of PLC channel modeling are attenuation and
noise. Consider an example of a simple electrical network
with a transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), as given in
Figure 5. The main sources of attenuation and noise are
the electrical appliances plugged in between. Modeled with
dashed boxes in Figure 5, each connected appliance has an
impedance and produces some noise that is non-Gaussian
and that depends on the device type, as shown in [9]. The
authors in [9] summarize the diﬀerent types of noise existing
in the PLC channel.
The spatial variation of PLC is mainly aﬀected by the
position, the impedance, and the number of appliances con-
nected to the network. When it comes to PLC, the electri-
cal cable becomes a transmission line, with a characteristic
impedance. The connection of appliances creates impedance
mismatches to this transmission line, causing the transmit-
ted signal to be reﬂected multiple times. For example, in Fig-
ure 5, at point M, we have an impedance mismatch and any
signal s arriving at M is partly reﬂected (signal r) and partly
propagates (signal t) towards the same direction as the orig-
inal signal s. Reﬂections of signals at various impedance-
mismatched points result in multiple versions of the initially
transmitted signal arriving at diﬀerent times at the receiver,
thus establishing a multi-path channel for PLC. We will see
in the next section that temporal variation is aﬀected by
multi-path eﬀects, i.e., the appliances’ impedance, in long-
term timescales, whereas it is aﬀected only by noise at short-
term timescales.
A very important characteristic of power-line channels is
that they exhibit performance asymmetry, i.e., capacity can
diﬀer signiﬁcantly between the two directions of the link.
In all the experiments we run (both with AV and AV500),
6Broadcast packets cannot be used to estimate capacity. See
for example [7], [8].

Figure 5: Multi-path and noise in PLC channels
we observe a performance asymmetry of more than 1.5x in
approximately 30% of stations pairs in our testbed. Fig-
ure 6 presents typical examples of these links, for which the
throughput in one direction is less than 60% of the through-
put in the opposite direction. By re-conducting the exper-
iments with AV500 devices, we verify that the asymmetry
is not due to the hardware. Link asymmetry in PLC has
been also observed in [13]. We attribute this asymmetry to
a high electrical-load (for instance, one or more appliances
with much higher impedance than cable’s impedance) exist-
ing close to one of the two stations. In this case, the channel
cannot be considered as symmetric and the two transmission
directions in the link experience diﬀerent attenuations.
In our tests with WiFi, presented in Section 4, we also
observe that wireless channels can also exhibit asymmetry.
However, compared to PLC, this occurs on a much smaller
subset of links, and is much less severe (for instance, the
WiFi asymmetry was up to 1.5x for good links and up to
3.5x for bad links). An asymmetry of loss rates has been
found experimentally for residential WiFi networks in [14].

Figure 6: Throughput asymmetry in PLC links.
We now turn to our spatial variation study, where we use
both AV and AV500. Figure 7 provides the available UDP
throughput of single links as a function of the cable distance
between the source and the destination of the traﬃc from a
single experiment. There is a clear degradation of through-
put as distance increases. However, because of the diver-
sity in positions and types of connected appliances, there
is a large range of possible throughputs at any speciﬁc dis-
tance. We observe that small distances (<30m) guarantee
good links, but that large distances (30-100m) can yield ei-
ther good or bad links. By comparing AV and AV500, we
observe that AV500 enables some links with no AV connec-
tivity to still enjoy a non-zero throughput, but with severe
asymmetries (e.g., link 10-2 with 10x asymmetry).
To further explore the causes that aﬀect the attenuation,
we run some experiments with two stations connected by a
long electrical cable and without any devices attached. We
notice that the attenuation in an up to 70 m cable causes
a throughput drop of at most 2 Mbps. The attenuation
is therefore caused by the multi-path nature of the PLC
channel. By plugging electrical appliances in this isolated
