User: this has been very frustrating now, like once every 2 days my anaconda just stops working correctly , i am using pycharm as my IDE and everything works fine , suddenly i find my anaconda terminal (command prompt if u will) starting randomly for no obvious reason , if i hit run on pycharm it opens the terminal and doesn't do anything , if i navigate to my .py file location and try to run it through command prompt it simply runs a new command prompt ( the python command prompt ) and does nothing no code is running its awaiting further commands. is this normal ? anyone has a solution to this 
i am using windows 7
Assistant: i fixed this issue by uninstalling everything related to python from my computer and removing all environment variables as well , reinstalling anaconda after that to its default location fixed the problem .
