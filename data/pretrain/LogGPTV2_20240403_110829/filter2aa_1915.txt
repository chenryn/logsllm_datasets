# Nmap: Scanning the Internet

## Presenter
Fyodor, Insecure.Org

## Event Details
- **Black Hat Briefings USA**: August 6, 2008; 10 AM
- **Defcon 16**: August 8, 2008; 4 PM

## Abstract
Nmap Security Scanner is designed for efficient scanning of large networks. Fyodor, the author of Nmap, has expanded its capabilities by scanning millions of Internet hosts as part of the Worldscan project. This presentation will cover the most interesting findings and empirical statistics from these scans, along with practical advice for enhancing scan performance. Additional topics include:
- Detecting and subverting firewall and intrusion detection systems
- Handling unusual network configurations
- Advanced host discovery and port scanning techniques
- A brief overview of new Nmap features

## Slide Disclaimer
These slides were prepared in June, while scans were still ongoing and analysis was at least a month away from completion. Therefore, the final slides will differ materially from these. The slides are from the inaugural Black Hat Webcast with Jeff Moss on June 22, 2008. The webcast provides an overview of the talk and some early results from the scans. The video is scheduled to be posted at [http://blackhat.com](http://blackhat.com) in early July.

## Planning the Big Scan
- Determining IP addresses to scan
- Peer-to-peer (P2P) scanning
- Legal considerations
- Firewall management
- Performance optimization

## Scan Results
- Scans are still in progress.
- Some preliminary results are available and can help improve scan performance.

## Best TCP Ports for Host Discovery
- Echo requests and default Nmap discovery scans are insufficient for comprehensive Internet scanning.
- Adding more TCP SYN and ACK probes can enhance discovery, but which ports are most effective?

### Top 10 TCP Host Discovery Ports
1. 80/http
2. 25/smtp
3. 22/ssh
4. 443/https
5. 21/ftp
6. 113/auth
7. 23/telnet
8. 53/domain
9. 554/rtsp
10. 3389/ms-term-server

## Default Host Discovery Effectiveness
```bash
# nmap -n -sL -iR 50000 -oN - | grep "not scanned" | awk '{print $2}' | sort -n > 50K_IPs
# nmap -sP -T4 -iL 50K_IPs
Starting Nmap ( http://nmap.org )
Host dialup-4.177.9.75.Dial1.SanDiego1.Level3.net (4.177.9.75) appears to be up.
...
Nmap done: 50000 IP addresses (3348 hosts up) scanned in 1598.067 seconds
```

## Enhanced Host Discovery Effectiveness
```bash
# nmap -sP -PE -PP -PS21,22,23,25,80,113,31339 -PA80,113,443,10042 --source-port 53 -T4 -iL 50K_IPs
Starting Nmap 4.65 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2008-06-22 19:07 PDT
Host sim7124.agni.lindenlab.com (8.10.144.126) appears to be up.
...
Nmap done: 50000 IP addresses (4473 hosts up) scanned in 4259.281 seconds
```

### Enhanced Discovery Results
- Time taken: 71 minutes vs. 27 minutes (increase of 167%)
- Found 1,125 more live hosts (increase of 34%)

## Top Open TCP & UDP Ports
- Data will be available by Black Hat USA.
- Significant reduction from the current default of 1703 TCP ports and 1480 UDP ports.
- The `--top-ports` feature is available, but currently lacks data.

## Nmap News!

### Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
```bash
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org
Starting Nmap ( http://nmap.org )
Interesting ports on scanme.nmap.org (64.13.134.52):
Not shown: 1709 filtered ports
PORT    STATE  SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp  open   ssh     OpenSSH 4.3 (protocol 2.0)
...
Nmap done: 1 IP address scanned in 30.567 seconds
Raw packets sent: 3464 (154KB) | Rcvd: 60 (3KB)
```

### Fixed-rate Packet Sending
```bash
# nmap --min-rate 500 scanme.nmap.org
```

### Zenmap GUI
Zenmap is the official Nmap Security Scanner GUI.

### 2nd Generation OS Detection

# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org
[...]
Device type: general purpose
Running: Linux 2.6.X
OS details: Linux 2.6.20-1 (Fedora Core 5)
More info: http://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html
```

### Version Detection
- Now includes 4,803 signatures.

### --reason
```bash
# nmap --reason -T4 scanme.nmap.org
[...]

Not shown: 1709 filtered ports
Reason: 1709 no-responses
PORT    STATE  SERVICE REASON
22/tcp  open   ssh     syn-ack
...
```

### Advanced Traceroute
```bash
# nmap --traceroute scanme.nmap.org
[...]
