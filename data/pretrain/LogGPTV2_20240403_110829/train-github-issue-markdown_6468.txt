When using `importMap` with `deno install`, I encountered an issue where the code does not execute as expected. This was tested with Deno v1.30.3.

## Minimal Reproducible Example

### `deno.json`
```json
{
  "imports": {
    "std/": "https://deno.land/std@0.177.0/"
  }
}
```

### `my-cli.ts`
```typescript
import * as log from 'std/log/mod.ts';
log.info('Hello world!');
```

### Installation and Execution
```sh
deno install -A ./my-cli.ts
my-cli
```

### Error Output
```
error: Relative import path "std/log/mod.ts" not prefixed with / or ./ or ..
    at file:///C:/temp/app.ts:1:22
```

The same issue occurs when using an `import_map.json` file. The code only works with `deno install` if absolute paths are used.

### Detailed Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a `deno.json` file with the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "imports": {
        "std/": "https://deno.land/std@0.177.0/"
      }
    }
    ```

2. Create a `my-cli.ts` file with the following content:
    ```typescript
    import * as log from 'std/log/mod.ts';
    log.info('Hello world!');
    ```

3. Install the script using:
    ```sh
    deno install -A ./my-cli.ts
    ```

4. Run the installed script:
    ```sh
    my-cli
    ```

5. Observe the error:
    ```
    error: Relative import path "std/log/mod.ts" not prefixed with / or ./ or ..
        at file:///C:/temp/app.ts:1:22
    ```

### Additional Notes
- The issue persists even when using an `import_map.json` file.
- Using absolute paths in the import statements resolves the problem, but this is not ideal for maintainability and portability.

If you have any suggestions or workarounds, please let me know.
