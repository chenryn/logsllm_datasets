User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 vacuum_event 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks whether the query related table has undergone a vacuum operation, which could potentially be a root cause of slow SQL queries. It first retrieves the probable time interval for an analyze operation from the monitoring module. Then, it creates a dictionary of vacuum information for each table in the table structure, including the schema name, table name, and the time of the last vacuum operation. The function then checks whether the vacuum time falls within the time range of the slow SQL query execution or whether the slow SQL query execution starts within a certain time interval after the vacuum operation. If any table meets these conditions, it is considered a root cause and added to the detail dictionary. If no table meets these conditions, it is not a root cause.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- table_structure
- slow_sql_param
- vacuum_delay
- start_at
- duration_time
