User: I would like to automate the response for some question prompted by some programs, like mysql  prompting for a password, or apt asking for a 'yes' or ... when I want to rebuild my haystack index with a ./manage.py rebuild_index.
For MySQL, I can use the --password= switch, and I'm sure that apt has a 'quiet' like option. But how can I pass the response to other programs ?
Assistant: Those both methods are valid and works.
I choose the first one, because I didn't want to have any interaction with my deployment system.
So here is the solution I used:

% yes | ./manage.py rebuild_index
