User: How to create and use an SSH key pair?
Assistant: An SSH key pair is an authentication method in the SSH protocol, which uses a combination of a public key and a private key for authentication. Here are the steps to create and use an SSH key pair: 1. Open a terminal or command prompt. 2. Generate an SSH key pair. Enter the following command in a terminal or command prompt: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" NOTE: Change "your_email@example.com" to your actual email address. 3. You will be prompted for a filename and passphrase. You can accept the default filename and passphrase or enter values of your choice. 4. Once generated, the SSH key pair can be found on the local computer. By default, key pairs are stored in the ~/.ssh directory. 5. Add the generated public key (id_rsa.pub) to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server you want to access. 6. Use the private key for SSH login. You can run SSH commands by: ssh -i /path/to/private/key username@server_ip_address Note: Change "/path/to/private/key" to the actual path of your saved private key file and " username" to your username on the server and "server_ip_address" to the actual IP address of the server. 7. If you are using a Unix-like operating system, you can save your SSH configuration in the ~/.ssh/config file so that you donâ€™t have to enter details like username and IP address every time. 8. Done. Summary: The process of generating an SSH key pair and adding the public key to a trusted server is relatively simple, but the protection of the private key is very important. The private key cannot be shared with anyone and is best protected with a password. Using an SSH key pair will increase the security of the SSH protocol.
