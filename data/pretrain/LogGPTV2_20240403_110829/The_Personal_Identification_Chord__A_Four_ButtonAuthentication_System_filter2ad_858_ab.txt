a limited extent the eyes-free, input scenarios highlighted by our
interview participants.

and GUI (shown/hidden). The PIN condition was a standard 3 × 4
arrangement of a 0–9 numerical grid and was implemented in the
same screen area, and featured the same inter-target spacing, as the
PIC system: each target was 103 pixels wide (9.65mm) by 60 pixels
high (5.63mm). The input-mode variable was fully balanced among
participants, while the hidden condition for each input-mode was
always presented immediately after the shown condition. This en-
sured participants practiced with each GUI before completing tasks
without it. Each condition featured four blocks of 50 trials, with
each block including five repetitions of the ten possible PIN items
or PIC taps. Items in each block were presented in a random order
and the first block of trials was treated as practice and discarded.
In the shown conditions, participants were required to complete all
trials correctly – any erroneous trials were returned to the pool of
incomplete trials and displayed again later in the block. In contrast,
in the hidden conditions, participants were not required to complete
error trials, ensuring that (regardless of the difficulty of the hidden
input task) the study would be completed in a reasonable period of
time.
Each trial followed a simple structure: participants tapped the
screen to start, a fixation spot was displayed for 500ms, followed
by the experimental instructions and (in the shown conditions) the
graphical targets. Participants then made the requested selection by
touching and releasing the screen. Figure 2 shows the experimental
screen in both shown conditions – it includes identical instructions
in both textual and graphical forms at the top of the smartwatch
in the area typically reserved for displaying PIN entry progress.
Hidden conditions were identical to shown conditions, except that
the screen area showing the PIN or PIC keys was completely blank –
a black rectangle. For each trial, we logged trial correctness and two
measures of task time: preparation time referring to the period after
the fixation spot disappeared until the first touch to the screen and;
touch time referring to the duration the finger was in contact with
the screen. Directly after each of the four conditions participants
completed the NASA TLX [15] measure of subjective workload and
the Borg CR10 [6] measure of perceived exertion in order to capture
more qualitative aspects of performance.
4.1.1 Demographics. In total, 22 participants were recruited,
but one failed to complete the study. Of the remaining, nine were
female and they were aged between 20 and 30, with a mean of 22.
All were recruited from the local student body and self-rated their
experience with computers, touchscreens, and smartphones as high
(4.71/5, 4.2/5, 5/5) while mean performance with smartwatches,
smart-glasses, and other wearables was reported to be low (1.3/5).
One participant owned a smartwatch and reported a high level of ex-
perience (5/5). Participants were compensated with approximately
USD 10. In total, the study included 12,600 trials (21 participants ×
4 conditions × 3 blocks × 5 repetitions × 10 items/taps).
4.2 Results
Figure 3 shows the preparation time, touch time and error data for
each condition while the subjective data is shown in Figure 4. All
data passed normality checks and were analyzed with two-way
repeated measures ANOVA on the binary factors of input-mode
and GUI. In the interests of brevity, Table 1 reports only signifi-
cant results at p < 0.05. The two measures of time show significant
but numerically modest (~50–100ms) variations in performance
with small to medium effect sizes. The standard UI combination
instantiated in the PIN/shown condition performs optimally. This
conclusion is replicated in the error results, but with an interesting
wrinkle – the relatively strong interaction, supported by an inspec-
tion of the raw data, suggests that while the PIN condition resulted
in a sharp rise in errors between the shown and hidden conditions,
this effect was largely absent in the PIC condition – participants
were able to enter PIC taps in hidden conditions without impacting
error rates. The subjective data showed similar patterns. Given
strong general trend evident in the raw TLX scores, we opted to
analyze only overall workload in addition to the Borg CR10 data.
While the results again favor the PIN/shown combination, we note
the absolute values suggest that participants did not struggle with
any of the tasks in the study: TLX hovers around the midpoint of
the scale, while Borg CR10 data is best characterized as “light,” indi-
cating that participants could continue the task without difficulty.
In this data, we once again observed close similarity between the
shown and hidden PIC data. The stability of ratings between these
conditions reinforces the idea that the participants entered PIC taps
as easily without as with a GUI to cue them. We argue these results
support the continued study of the PIC technique: performance is
fast, accurate, resilient to challenging input conditions, and does
not subjectively burden users.

5 THIRD STUDY: PIC AND PIN USABILITY
This section presents a user study comparing authentication perfor-
mance of PINs and PICs. The user study was designed to specifically
measure recall-rate, input entry, and input accuracy performances
in a more realistic screen unlocking scenario. We considered two
research questions while designing the user study. Firstly, how se-
cure and readily recalled are PICs compared to PINs? Secondly, can
we improve security of PICs by mandating the use of dual-taps?
Answering these questions will provide a balanced assessment of
the potential of the PIC technique.
5.1 Methodology
5.1.1 User study design. To investigate these questions, we eval-
uated the effectiveness of a standard PIN against three PIC policies
(detailed in the following section), in a two session study conducted
at two universities. Sessions were spread over two days and par-
ticipants were screened for availability on both days. They were
compensated with retail vouchers worth approximately USD 10 for
each session. The study followed a between-groups design in which
each participant completed study tasks for a single policy (exper-
imental condition) in order to avoid practice and/or order effects.
Before running the real user study, we conducted pilot studies with
35 participants to fix bugs, finalize the protocol, and address unclear
instructions and descriptions. All of the three studies presented in
this paper were IRB approved.
5.1.2 PIC policies. The four policies in the study are as follows:
PIN-original: This condition used the PIN input-mode from
the first study, and enforced a password policy based that used on
the Apple Watch, a popular wearable device. PINs were required
to be four digits in length and a warning was presented if users
attempted to create PINs with repeated digits or pairs, ascending
numerals or common dates (e.g., birth years), lexical or geometrical
codes.
PIC-free: This condition used the PIC input-mode from the first
study and enforced parts of the PIN password policy. Years and
lexical or geometric content were omitted due to a lack of digits or
similarly configured keys.
PIC-dual: This condition used the PIC input-mode and PIC-free
policy. In addition, users were required to compose their password
using at least one dual-tap. If they attempted to enter a PIC with-
out using a dual-tap, they were told it was invalid and required

to choose another PIC. This policy resembles a commonly used
password complexity policy that mandates the use of at least one
special character.
PIC-dual-rand: This final condition implemented a policy sim-
ilar to that of PIC-free, except that participants were required
to use a specific dual-tap provided to them as part of the study
instructions. We borrow this policy idea from SysPal [9] – their
findings show that mandating one random point can significantly
improve pattern security with minimal compromise in recall-rate.
The required dual-taps were equally sampled across all participants
in this policy (i.e., an equal number of participants were assigned
each dual-tap).
5.1.3
System. To evaluate the four policies in a realistic setting,
we developed the application used in the second study into a system
that resembles real-world smartwatch PIN screen lock setup and
unlock GUIs. Using this application, we collected the participants’
behavioral data to examine how they choose a PIN or PIC and used
it to unlock the Sony smartwatch we provided. This application
adjusted thresholds in classifier based on the usability study results,
most importantly using a ±30 threshold for angle and enabling
single long horizontal touches to select dual-taps 1+2 and 3+4. It
also included a standard PIN entry grid with four feedback boxes
that were greyed out when no PIN/PIC items had been entered and
turned successively green from left to right as PIN/PIC items were
produced. These boxes could also be used to present textual PIN/PIC
reminders. The top bar of the app also included a back button that
deleted a single PIN/PIC item and a clear button that cleared all
items. When four items were entered, the system automatically
committed the PIN or PIC. The updated GUI is shown in Figure 2.
5.1.4 Procedure. This section provides details of the data col-
lection procedures in the order participants completed them.
1. Practice: Participants first completed a five to ten minute
training session based on the system described in study two and us-
ing the input-mode appropriate for their assigned policy condition.
They first completed a shown session composed of five blocks of
each possible PIN/PIC input with a standard GUI and then a similar
GUI-hidden condition. In total, this session involved entering 100
PIN/PIC items.
2. PIN/PIC setup: Each participant was randomly assigned to
one of the four policies and given appropriate instructions to create
a PIN or PIC. For PIC-dual this entailed instructions to use at least
one dual-tap. For PIC-dual-rand participants were given paper
showing the specific dual-tap they were required to use. Borrowing
from Uellenbeck et al.’s [31] virtual sweet method, the participants
were also told there was a further voucher worth approximately
USD 5 in the watch. In order to get the voucher, they would have
to remember their PIN or PIC in a follow up session one day later,
and also generate a PIN or PIC that prevented other participants
from accessing their watch. The intention was to encourage the
participants to generate PINs or PICs that are both easy to recall
and secure. Participants then entered a PIN or PIC to set it up,
and dealt with any policy warnings or failures by either clicking
past them (for warnings) or restarting the setup process. Finally,
they re-entered an identical PIN or PIC to confirm. Confirmation
failures led to starting afresh. The dual-tap that participants in the
