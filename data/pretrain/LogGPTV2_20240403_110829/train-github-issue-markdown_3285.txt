Hello,

I encountered an error related to git submodules while building my Dockerfile. Here are the details:

**Dockerfile Step:**
```dockerfile
Step 10/14 : RUN git submodule update --init
```

**Error Message:**
```
---> Running in 0633cd9d62c6
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
The command '/bin/sh -c git submodule update --init' returned a non-zero code: 128
```

**Environment:**
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 16.04
- **Git Version:** 2.16.1

It appears that the `.git` directory is not present in the working directory, which is causing the `git submodule update --init` command to fail. Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
