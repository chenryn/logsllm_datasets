## Update
This issue is a duplicate of #2795
## TL;DR
I believe this is just a typo. `%5` should be actual width and `%6` should be
actual height. Instead, these two are swapped in the tooltip. The actual
implementation in the format still works so doing `%5 x %6` would give `width
x height`, as expected.

## ‚Ñπ Computer information
  * PowerToys version: v0.20.1
  * PowerToy Utility: Image Resizer
  * Running PowerToys as Admin: no
  * Windows build number: Version 1909 (OS Build 18363.1016)
## üìù Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)
  1. Enable ImageResizer
  2. Under File and the option Filename Format, use the following format: `%1 %5 %6` (any format that uses `%5` and `%6` will work)
  3. Resize any image file, ensuring that you make a copy when you resize it.
  4. Check the filename for the resized image.
### ‚úîÔ∏è Expected result
Assuming the filename is `oopsie.png`. After the resize, assuming we picked
1920x1080 (fill), and the format is `%1 (%6x%5)` (actual width by actual
height), the new filename is `oopsie (1920x1080).png`.
### ‚ùå Actual result
Assuming we choose the options and have the format as stated above, we'd
instead get `oopsie (1080x1920).png`.
