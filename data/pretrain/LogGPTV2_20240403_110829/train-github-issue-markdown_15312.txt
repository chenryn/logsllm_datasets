# Feature request
When using a `next export` static build, I would like the `getInitialProps`
method to fire only during the build step and not on the client for select
page components. (Related StackOverflow question)
On a static client, Next.js invokes this method before the page component is
rendered in order to provide the necessary props for the component. Thus,
large requests can delay the client's first paint as this is a blocking
request.
I would like to selectively ignore `getInitialProps` for a page component, and
instead use the props provided by `getInitialProps` during `next export`.
I'm unwilling to move my slow API request to `componentDidMount` in order to
avoid the blocking request because I want to use the data returned during the
build step to populate the static HTML, and this particular request doesn't
need to be dynamic or updated after the build.

\- Shallow Routing
For this feature request, is it possible to implement something similar to
shallow routing, but for _new_ pages?
To circumvent `getInitialProps` on static exports, I currently have to use a
standard JSX anchor `` to avoid invoking the method. This
does cause a full page refresh which is a poor solution.
