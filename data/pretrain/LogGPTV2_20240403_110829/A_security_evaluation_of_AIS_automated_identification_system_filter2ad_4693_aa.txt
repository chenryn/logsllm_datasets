ABSTRACT
AIS, Automatic Identiﬁcation System, is an application of
cyber-physical systems (CPS) to smart transportation at
sea. Being primarily used for collision avoidance and traﬃc
monitoring by ship captains and maritime authorities, AIS
is a mandatory installation for over 300,000 vessels world-
wide since 2002. Other promoted beneﬁts are accident in-
vestigation, aids to navigation and search and rescue (SAR)
operations. In this paper, we present a unique security eval-
uation of AIS, by introducing threats aﬀecting both the im-
plementation in online providers and the protocol speciﬁ-
cation. Using a novel software-based AIS transmitter that
we designed, we show that our ﬁndings aﬀect all transpon-
ders deployed globally on vessels and other maritime sta-
tions like lighthouses, buoys, AIS gateways, vessel traﬃc
services and aircraft involved in SAR operations. Our con-
cerns have been acknowledged by online providers and inter-
national standards organizations, and we are currently and
actively working together to improve the overall security.

INTRODUCTION
AIS is an Automatic Identiﬁcation System introduced to
enhance the safety of vessels traﬃc by automatically ex-
changing up-to-date information, as well as tracking and
monitoring of ships. Since 2002, AIS is a mandatory in-
stallation for international voyaging ships having a gross
tonnage of at least 3001, and all passenger ships regard-
less of their size. Found to be beneﬁcial to the maritime
industry, nowadays pleasure crafts and ﬁshing boats are of-
ten equipped with an automatic identiﬁcation system. With
an estimated number of over 300,000 installations according
to a popular online AIS provider2, AIS is currently an im-
portant and widely used technology and solution in smart
transportation. Some known beneﬁts are traﬃc monitoring,

collision avoidance, search and rescue operations, accidents
investigations and aids to navigation. Clearly, the number
of AIS-equipped vessels might be higher because vessels are
not required to register with online providers.
AIS works by acquiring GPS coordinates and exchanging
via radio transmissions current and up-to-date information
between ships and maritime authorities – i.e. vessel traﬃc
services located onshore. AIS information includes, but is
not limited to, ships’ position, name and cargo and aids to
navigation, frequently used by port authorities to assist a
ship’s navigation or warn about hazards, low tides, rocky
outcroppings and shoals commonly found at sea. In open
sea, AIS-enabled distress beacons are used to signal and lo-
cate a man overboard. AIS data is collected and exchanged
between AIS providers operating over the Internet, which of-
fer AIS data visualization, monitoring and reporting in free
or commercial forms.
Given its primary importance and prevalence in maritime
traﬃc safety, we conducted a comprehensive security evalu-
ation of AIS, by tackling it from both a software and a hard-
ware (i.e., radio-frequency) perspective. Overall, we identi-
ﬁed threats aﬀecting AIS globally, either at its implementa-
tion level or in the protocol speciﬁcation. They allow, for
example, disabling AIS communications (i.e., DoS), tamper-
ing with existing AIS data (i.e., to modify the information
broadcast by a ship), triggering search and rescue alerts in
order to lure a victim ship into navigating to a hostile and
attacker-controlled sea space, or spooﬁng a collision in order
to possibly bring a ship oﬀ course. Interestingly, according
to Bloomberg [3], AIS was found, in the past, to be polluted
with counterfeit information, i.e. with Iranian ships having
switched their ﬂagged countries to Zanzibar as US and Eu-
rope tighten sanctions over their nuclear programs.
In summary, our contributions are the following:
• We conducted a security evaluation of AIS – A cyber-
physical system introduced to enhance vessels tracking
and provide extra safety to maritime traﬃc, on top of
conventional radar installations;
• We designed and implemented a novel software-based
AIS transmitter, that we called AISTX ;
• We identiﬁed and veriﬁed several threats aﬀecting both
the current implementation and the protocol speciﬁca-
tion of AIS;
• We did responsible disclosure and collaborated actively
with the aﬀected providers, international standards or-
(AtoN) standard was developed with the ability to broad-
cast the positions and names of objects other than vessels,
such as navigational aid and marker positions and dynamic
data reﬂecting the markerˆa ˘A´Zs environment (e.g., currents
and climatic conditions). These aids can be located on shore,
such as in a lighthouse, or on water platforms, such as buoys.
Examples of AtoN installations are provided by online AIS
providers, such as Marine Traﬃc4.
Finally, an example of the importance of the utilization of
AIS revolves around accident investigation. Since AIS pro-
vides GPS coordinates, course, ground speed, and additional
information, it proves more valuable in accident investiga-
tion versus the less accurate radar technology used widely to-
day. For the same reason, AIS is largely used in search-and-
rescue transponders. AIS-SARTs are self-contained, water-
proof devices intended for emergencies, mainly to help the
detection and location of vessels and people in distress, i.e.
a man overboard.
AIS, as we depict in Figure 1, works by acquiring GPS co-
ordinates and exchanging regional information with nearby
stations via VHF, i.e. two radio channels operating at 161.975
and 162.025 MHz, and with AIS providers operating over the
Internet. These providers collect data primarily through AIS
gateways deployed geographically, i.e. along coast lines and
in vessel traﬃc services (VTS) operated by port authorities.
A VTS is a ship traﬃc monitoring system established by
maritime authorities, similar to air traﬃc control systems
for aviation. In addition, single individuals, such as a ship’s
captain, can upstream AIS data by using a mobile app and a
special forwarding software, which duplicates and sends the
data to the desired providers as soon as the data is made
available.
AIS information is broadcasted, collected and exchanged
on a regular basis – varying from a couple of seconds to
minutes, depending on the type of information and condi-
tion of the station. For example, a class-B equipped ship
navigating faster than 23 knots is supposed to broadcast its
position every 5 seconds. Conversely, an aid to navigation,
for example a lighthouse or a buoy notifying an hazard, is
sent every 3 minutes.
By regulation, each communicating station, such as a ship,
is required to register and obtain valid AIS identiﬁers, namely
MMSI and call-sign, which are issued by oﬃcial maritime au-
thorities like the US Coast Guard or the Italian Ministry of
Economic Development. The maritime mobile service iden-
tity (MMSI) consists of a nine-digits number uniquely iden-
tifying a station. The ﬁrst three digits of the MMSI, the
maritime identiﬁcation digits (MID), speciﬁes the country
– e.g. 247 for Italy and 338 for United States of America
according to ITU-R5. The call-signs are a designation for ra-
dios, or AIS stations willing to communicate, and are widely
used in marine, aviation, military, spacecraft, and by radio
amateurs.
Finally, AIS information is rendered via chart-plotters or
providers, e.g. Vessel Finder6, which, in near real-time, visu-
alize the status of other vessels in the region, navigation aids
and other useful maritime information, such as weather fore-
casts or critical situations. These systems allow worldwide
access to AIS statistics, vessels, lighthouses, buoys locations,

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion 2 introduces AIS and explains how it works. Section 3
gives a general overview of the issues that we identiﬁed. Sec-
tion 4 describes the software-based threats. In Section 5 we
introduce and detail AISTX, the AIS transmitter that we
designed and implemented to conduct the radio-frequency
evaluation described in Section 6. Section 7 discusses ethical
implications, mitigation strategies and collaboration with
the aﬀected parties. Finally, Sections 8 and 9 look over
related work and brieﬂy conclude.
2. AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM
Since 2002 IMO’s SOLAS convention3 the Automatic Iden-
tiﬁcation System (AIS ) is required for international voyag-
ing ships having a gross tonnage of 300 or more, and all pas-
senger vessels regardless of their size. Found to be heavily
used and widely beneﬁcial to the maritime industry, a sec-
ond generation of AIS devices, termed class-B transponders,
were introduced in 2006. When compared with their prede-
cessors, i.e. class-A, class-B are typically smaller, lower cost,
and simpler to operate. These are typically used in smaller
vessels, pleasure vessels, or any ﬁshing vessel less than 300
tons. Since 2010, AIS-related regulations have been con-
stantly adjusted, making it easier to implement and deploy
AIS installations. As of 2014, AIS is estimated to be running
on at least 300,000 vessels, and in the near future, there is
expected to be near a million installations.
Nowadays, AIS is a major technology and solution in
traﬃc monitoring and vessels assistance. Shipowners and
maritime authorities rely on AIS to supplement traditional
radars for collision avoidance and location tracking, in ad-
dition to complementary systems like visual observations,
audio exchanges and LRIT (long-range identiﬁcation and
tracking).
AIS has many promoted beneﬁts. Any ship transmitting
an AIS signal can be received by nearby ships and help make
the captains aware of the other shipsˆa ˘A´Z location. In addi-
tion, AIS provides navigational aids. The aids-to-navigation

and corresponding details on a simple, easy to navigate dis-
play or website. In addition, AIS information collected from
providers is useful in identifying, for example, ships spilling
oil in open sea [1] and predicting the ﬁnancial gain given by
marine trading [17].
3. THREATS OVERVIEW
In this Section, we give a general overview of the threats
that we identiﬁed in our research. As reported in Table 1,
we grouped them in three macro categories, namely spoof-
ing, hijacking, and availability disruption. For each threat,
we detail whether it can be performed via software (SW),
radio-frequency (RF), or both. Note that Figure 1 includes
the information on where attackers ﬁt in the AIS infrastruc-
ture. We describe in more detail the software and RF-based
attacks later in the paper, respectively in Sections 4 and 6.
Ship Spooﬁng [SW/RF].
This ﬁrst threat consists of crafting (i.e., spooﬁng) a valid
non-existent ship. This process involves assigning to the
ﬁctitious ship static information, such as the vessel’s name,
identiﬁers (i.e., MMSI and call sign), ﬂag, type of ship, cargo
type, manufacturer and dimension, and dynamic informa-
tion like the ship’s status (e.g., under way or anchored),
position, speed, course and destination. On top of ships,
aircraft involved in search and rescue (SAR) operations can
be spoofed as well. In fact, SAR aircraft are equipped with
AIS class-B transponders as per regulation.
As the reader can imagine, this threat gives an attacker
a wide surface of malicious scenarios, such as spooﬁng a
vessel into the jurisdiction of an adversarial nation or making
a nuke-carrying cargo sailing the waters of a nuclear-free
nation. In addition, vessels spooﬁng represent an issue for
automated systems doing data identiﬁcation and inference
on collected AIS information, for example to detect ships
spilling oil in open sea or to predict marine trading. An
attacker can counterfeit this information to blame someone
else’s vessel, for example.
AtoN Spooﬁng [SW/RF].
Navigational aids, also known as aids-to-navigation (AtoNs),
are commonly used to assist vessel traﬃc, for example along
a channel or a harbor, or to warn about hazards, low tides,
rocky outcroppings and shoals commonly found in open sea.
Spooﬁng AtoNs consists of crafting fake information to lure
a targeted ship into conducting wrong maneuvers. Some
examples consist of placing one or more buoys at the en-
trance of a harbor to tamper with existing traﬃc, or in-
stalling a fake buoy that maliciously instructs a ship into
navigating in low water. Given the number of diﬀerent aids-
to-navigations, there are multiple attack scenarios such as
for the spooﬁng of ships.
Collision Spooﬁng (CPA) [RF].
Collision avoidance is a primary application of AIS, which
