User: How to use Kafka technology to implement distributed message queue? Please list the implementation methods and application scenarios.
Assistant: Implementation method: 1. Install the Kafka cluster and create multiple Broker nodes in the cluster. 2. Create multiple Topics (topics), and each Topic contains multiple Partitions (partitions). 3. The producer sends the message to the Partition in the specified Topic, and the consumer gets the message from the Partition in the specified Topic. 4. Each Partition uses sequential storage internally, and the messages have a certain order, and are copied to multiple Broker nodes to ensure high availability. 5. The Kafka cluster coordinates and manages the final consistency through Zookeeper. Application scenarios: 1. Big data real-time processing: Kafka supports high-throughput message queues, which can be used to process large-scale data streams in real time. 2. Log collection: Kafka has the characteristics of high reliability, high scalability, and high load capacity, and can be used to receive and store system log information. 3. Online message system: Kafka supports multiple consumers to consume a topic at the same time, which can be used in online message systems, such as chat, real-time notification and other business scenarios. 4. Distributed crawler: Kafka supports message persistence, which can be used for unified management of URL queues in distributed crawlers. 5. Cost saving: As a message queue, Kafka can be used for asynchronous processing, decoupling business logic, and optimizing system performance, thereby reducing costs.
