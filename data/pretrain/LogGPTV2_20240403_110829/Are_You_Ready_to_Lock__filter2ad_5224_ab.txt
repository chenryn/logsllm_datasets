cial accounts, applications used for purchasing items, email
accounts, social networking, and ﬁle sharing/backup. The
purpose of these questions was to understand the sensitive
data that might be stored on each participant’s device.
3. Backup and Syncing Behaviors: We asked whether partici-
pants backup or sync their smartphones, their motivations for
doing so, and their methods. For comparison, we also asked
them whether they back up other devices they own (e.g., lap-
tops). The purpose of these questions was to estimate the
data loss impact of a lost or stolen device.
4. Locking Behaviors: We asked participants whether or not
they locked their smartphones, and if so, the method they
used to do so (e.g., PIN, drawing a pattern, etc.). We veri-
ﬁed their responses (i.e., we observed participants unlocking
their smartphones during the interview). We then asked par-
ticipants why they chose or chose not to lock their devices,
as well as whether they performed other types of security be-
haviors, both on their current and previous smartphones, as
well as on their other computing devices. For example, “Did
you use a security lock on your old smartphone?,” “When did
you ﬁrst start using a security lock on that phone?,” “Have
you ever forgotten your security lock?,” “Have you ever told
anyone else your security lock?,” and “Do you know the se-
curity lock of anyone else’s device?”
5. Sharing Behaviors: Finally, we asked participants whether
anyone else ever uses their devices and whether they ever use
others’ devices. This included speciﬁc scenarios about the
types of data that they would be concerned with other people
seeing, the personal and professional ramiﬁcations of a lost
or stolen device, and whether they had previously thought
about any of these issues.
Grounded theory is a well-established method for performing
qualitative research [19], in which hypotheses are only established
after a thorough examination of the data. Multiple researchers per-
form thematic analysis of interview data by independently reading
over participants’ responses to create lists of themes that each re-
searcher observed in the responses to each question. These themes
are known as “codes,” and this process is performed independently
to maximize the breadth of initial codes by preventing any one re-
searcher from dominating the process. Next, the researchers dis-
cuss their codes in order to merge their ﬁndings into a single “code-
book.” Using this codebook, each researcher independently codes
the data by reading through participants’ responses again. Finally,
the researchers discuss their codings, measure inter-rater agree-
ment, and then resolve any disagreements so that the resulting cod-
ings are unanimously agreed upon.
We digitally recorded each interview and transcribed the record-
ings. The transcriptions were used for all of the analysis in this pa-
per, with the second researcher’s notes available as backups. Next,
three researchers coded all 1,257 responses; the number of responses
per interview varied due to omissions and branching (e.g., partic-
ipants who did not use PINs to lock their smartphones did not re-
ceive questions about how they chose those PINs). Prior to meeting
to achieve consensus, the three independent coders disagreed on the
coding of 48 responses, achieving inter-rater agreement of 96%.1
4. RESULTS
Our primary goal was to better understand why smartphone users
choose to employ security locks on their devices. We observed our
28 participants interacting with their devices and found that 8 chose
not to lock them (29%). Of those who did, 18 used numerical PINs
(64%), one used Android’s pattern lock (4%), and one used a ﬁn-

codes; we therefore found it infeasible to calculate Cohen’s kappa
separately for every coded question.

gerprint (his was the only device with this capability). In the re-
mainder of this section, we provide details about how participants
use the locking mechanisms on their devices. We present explana-
tions for why participants chose to lock their devices, how those
decisions correlate with other security behaviors, and how these
behaviors are inﬂuenced by various risk perceptions.
4.1 How Locks Are Used
Of the 20 participants who locked their smartphones, fourteen
(70%) reported enabling this feature as soon as they purchased
their devices, whereas the remaining six enabled it after they had
already owned their smartphones for several months. Eighteen of
our participants used numerical PINs, and of these, half admitted to
choosing their PINs based on PINs they used elsewhere, such as at
an ATM or on a bicycle lock. One participant said that he initially
chose a unique PIN for his smartphone as a good security practice,
but after repeatedly forgetting it, he ultimately reverted to using
a PIN that he used elsewhere. Seven participants (37% of 19)2
said they had previously changed their unlock codes; four of whom
did so to make them more memorable, whereas three participants
changed them to make them harder for others to guess. We asked
participants whether they ever felt that unlocking their devices was
a nuisance, and while eight said yes (40%), we observed no signif-
icant correlation with whether or not their smartphone PINs were
used elsewhere. This suggests that the burden of remembering an
additional PIN is minimal, and that the nuisance associated with
unlocking a device may not be due to the memory aspect.
Another potential nuisance is having to enter an unlock code too
frequently (i.e., due to a device automatically locking after sitting
idly for too long). We asked participants to navigate to the settings
screen on their devices so that we could see the screen timeout in-
terval that was set. By default (at the time of this writing), Android
devices lock after 30 seconds of inactivity, whereas iOS devices
lock after 60 seconds. A total of eleven participants had changed
the default values (55% of 20), ten of whom made it longer so that
they would not have to enter their unlock codes so frequently (in-
creased to a median of 5 minutes), whereas one participant made
it shorter (decreased to 15 seconds). In each case, the participants
who extended the time cited the inconvenience of having to enter
unlock codes repeatedly, whereas the participant who decreased it
cited privacy reasons. This suggests that platform developers may
want to increase these default timeout intervals, lest some users be-
come annoyed and disable the locking mechanism altogether. For
example, P2 used a ﬁngerprint and said that he would not lock his
device if he was required to enter a PIN every time.
We were curious if security lock usage on a previous smartphone
would be a predictor of current security lock usage. Of our 28 to-
tal participants, seventeen reported owning a previous smartphone.
However, we observed no correlation between previously and cur-
rently using a security lock (r = −0.054, p < 0.840). Twelve
participants locked their previous smartphones, and of those, nine
continued to do so on their current phones. Four participants who
did not previously lock their phones started doing so.
Three participants reported locking previous smartphones, but
for various reasons decided not to lock their current smartphones.
One participant, P10, disabled it because he was concerned about
others being able to contact his girlfriend in the case of an emer-
gency: “I was worried that if I got into an accident and somebody
needed to call, like, my girlfriend, that they wouldn’t be able to get
into my phone.”
2We do not consider the participant who used a ﬁngerprint.

Another participant, P15, reevaluated his decision, and decided
that the PIN was more trouble than he believed his information was
worth: “it wasn’t useful for me to have to unlock it every time I
wanted to use my phone. I wasn’t in any worry that my phone was
going to be taken or anything like that.”
A third participant, P23, had locked his previous smartphone, but
simply forgot to set it up on this one: “It said choose a password.
I think this time I was eager to maybe do something else so I said,
like, remind me later.”
4.2 Reasons for Locking
Before priming participants with questions about security and
privacy, we asked why they chose to lock their smartphones. Six
themes emerged, which we classiﬁed into two different categories.
First, about two-thirds of our participants who locked their devices
(14 of 20) mentioned very speciﬁc scenarios that they were trying
to avoid. Second, the remaining third of participants (6 of 20) in-
dicated that they locked their devices out of a more general sense
of “good security behavior,” rather than to counter any particular
perceived threat.
4.2.1
The most frequently cited reason for locking one’s phone was
privacy: eight participants (40% of the 20 using security locks)
indicated that they chose to lock their devices to prevent people they
knew from snooping or using their phones without permission. Six
of these participants speciﬁcally mentioned protection from friends
and family. Responses included:
Speciﬁc Privacy and Security Concerns
“I don’t want, like, when people go through my pic-
tures without me knowing...not all of my pictures I want
other people to see” (P8)
“I had to pay, like, per minute...so I didn’t want any-
body including friends to use it, or anybody who was
at home or family. You know you might use my phone
without me knowing, so I had a PIN on there” (P9)
“I got really really tired of my friends picking up my
phone and checking my emails...like I don’t have any-
thing to hide, but it’s like...privacy” (P14)
“Privacy from [my] mom and [my] sister” (P20)
Two participants worked with children and were concerned about
snooping in their workplace environments. Speciﬁcally, P12, a
teacher, mentioned problems with thefts in her school: “so students
couldn’t get into it if they stole it.”
P17, who worked in a municipal recreation department, men-
tioned a similar rationale:
“I was coaching a little girls’ soccer team and they
were wanting to get on my phone and play with it and
stuff...I was like, I’m going to put this [lock] on there...not
that I have anything to hide from them, but who knows
what little 10 year olds are going to do...I never both-
ered changing it so now I just have it.”
We asked participants if they had ever told anyone their unlock
codes: only three of these eight participants had done so (38%),
whereas of the other 13 participants who locked their devices, twelve
had acknowledged sharing unlock codes with others (92%). This
correlation was statistically signiﬁcant (φ = −0.589, p < 0.007).
That is, those who were concerned about speciﬁc individuals were
less likely to share their unlock codes than those only concerned
with strangers. Yet despite concerns about speciﬁc individuals,
most of these eight participants indicated that they were still com-
fortable allowing close friends and family to use their devices. In
fact, seven reported that someone else had used their phone in the
past four weeks (88% of 8). Thus, these participants were con-
cerned about regulating access to their devices, rather than locking
others out completely.
Similar to regulating when known individuals use the device, the
second most common rationale was preventing strangers from ac-
cessing devices. Speciﬁcally, six participants (30% of 20) men-
tioned the lock as either a theft deterrent or to prevent strangers
from accessing their personal information:
“I don’t do that [lock my phone] so that someone I
know can’t get in...” (P1)
“It at least prevents someone...from being able to pick
it up and messing around with it” (P4)
“Because otherwise my phone would just be able to be
accessed by anyone and I don’t want that. Also, I’m
automatically logged in to my email, my Facebook, a
lot of different things without having to put [in] a pass-
word” (P16)
“...[a thief] is not going to be able to use it” (P20)
P3, who used to work at an Apple Store, said he started using a
PIN because he was worried that he might leave his iPhone out and
customers would confuse it with a demo unit:
“I had more sensitive information on there, all my credit
card information, my bank information on there...I was
just more aware of what people would have access to.”
Three participants (15% of 20) mentioned that they enabled se-
curity locks on their smartphones after they personally had bad ex-
periences on a previous phone when they did not use a security
lock. For instance, P5 mentioned that a friend played a joke on
him by changing the default language to Russian: “my old phone,
someone took it and changed the settings...it was pretty hard to go
back to my original settings.”
Another, P6, mentioned a stranger making expensive calls:
“I accidentally left my phone—not the smartphone, but
my Razr—-a long time ago in a park...somebody actu-
ally used it to make calls, so now...with a smartphone
you have a lot more [personal data], compared to the
Razr cellphone, I’m a little paranoid about that.”
4.2.2 General Concerns
Contrasting with the majority of lock-using participants who iden-
tiﬁed speciﬁc threat models, six participants (30% of the 20 lock-
using participants) mentioned motivations that were more general.
These explanations amounted to enabling it simply because the op-
tion to do so was presented as part of their smartphone’s setup pro-
cess, social pressure from friends and/or family, or simply not see-
ing a downside to doing so.
Two of these participants (10% of 20) indicated that they began
locking their smartphones because they were prompted at setup and
otherwise would not have thought about it:
“I didn’t have that originally, but on one of the last up-
dates it like demanded it” (P11)
“I actually think that the gentleman just set it up when
he sold me the phone” (P28)
Given that these participants could not name a speciﬁc privacy
or security concern, one might expect that they would eventually
disable the security locks, if they believed that they otherwise had
no practical value. We asked participants about this and found that
P11 had been using a PIN for 12 months, the entire length of time
that she had owned a smartphone. P28, whose device was only 6
months old, indicated that he initially set it up on a previous phone
because the setup program prompted him, he then went out of his
way to set it up on his current phone out of habit.
Two other participants (10% of 20) said that they were persuaded
to use a locking mechanism by a friend or signiﬁcant other, and oth-
erwise would not have done so. That is, for some users, social in-
ﬂuence or adherence to social norms is the prime motivator, rather
than speciﬁc privacy or security concerns:
“I guess just that was suggested to be a good idea, my
girlfriend uses one” (P25)
“My friend reminded me that this was a smartphone...there
was access to lots of my accounts” (P27)
Finally, another two participants (10% of 20) indicated that they
set it up simply because they did not see a reason not to, though
could not mention any speciﬁc concerns:
“I ﬁgured since it had the feature anyway, it’s pretty
quick I guess, I might as well use it...” (P2)
“Just like, why not? I mean it was probably, I read
something about like easy tips to safeguard your phone
or something” (P7)
Our results indicate that most users actively enable locking mech-
anisms on their devices due to speciﬁc privacy and security con-
cerns, whereas a minority will do so when prompted and will con-
tinue to do so, even if they see it as a nuisance. That is, most users
see locking as a valuable feature.
4.3 Reasons for Not Locking
Eight participants chose not to lock their smartphones (29% of
28). Based on their responses to the initial question on why they
chose not to lock their devices, three non-mutually-exclusive themes
emerged: lack of motivation, convenience, and lack of concern.
The most common explanation was lack of motivation: they sim-
ply had not gotten around to setting it up, but were not averse to it.
Three participants (38% of 8) fell into this category. Though they
indicated that they would like to lock their phones, they had not
bothered to look into how to do so:
“Yeah, I thought about it.
I
mean, it’s probably something I should do, but...” (P19)
I just never bothered.
“It [current phone] said choose a password...I said,
like, remind me later.” (P23)
One participant was prompted during setup to enable locking
(P23), but postponed it and forgot. He said that he previously drew
