13.3 Multitransactions
Aswehaveseen,thelockingattributeisrepresentedbythexmaxfield,whichisset
totheofthetransactionthathasacquiredthelock.Sohowisthisattributeset
forasharedlockheldbyseveraltransactionsatatime?
When dealing with shared locks, Postgre applies so-called multitransactions
(multixacts).2 Amultitransactionisagroupoftransactionsthatisassignedasepa-
rate.Detailedinformationongroupmembersandtheirlockingmodesisstored
infilesunderthe/pg_multixactdirectory.Forfasteraccess,lockedpagesare
cachedinthesharedmemoryoftheserver;3allchangesareloggedtoensurefault
tolerance.
Multixactshavethesame-bitlengthasregulartransactions,buttheyare
issued independently. It means that transactions and multitransactions can po-
tentiallyhavethesames. Todifferentiatebetweenthetwo,Postgreusesan
additionalhintbit: xmax_is_multi.

Freezing of multitransactions can be managed by server parameters, which are
similar to those provided for regular freezing: vacuum_multixact_freeze_min_age,
vacuum_multixact_freeze_table_age, autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age, as well

But you can see it for yourself. Since Postgre acquires many different locks

So,thefirsttransactioniscommitted:
