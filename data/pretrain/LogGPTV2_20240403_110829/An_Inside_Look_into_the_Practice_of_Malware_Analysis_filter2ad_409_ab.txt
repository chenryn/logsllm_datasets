3 PARTICIPANTS
We received 46 responses to our screening survey and invited 39 of
them for an interview. 21 out of these 39 participants responded
and participated in an interview. Table 1 shows a breakdown of the
participants’ education, years of experience with malware analysis,
job title, and work industry. Participants have an average of 6 years
of experience, with experience levels ranging from 1 year to 15
years. The majority of the participants have a college degree: 8 have
a bachelor’s degree, 8 a master’s degree, and two hold doctorate
degrees. Although 18 of the participants have a college degree, many
of the participants were not formally taught the skills required for
malware analysis. Instead, many of the participants learned how
to analyze malware while working in a related field. Although
the participants have diverse backgrounds, we observed that the
majority have previous experience in either networks, systems,
reverse engineering or vulnerability discovery before transitioning
into malware analysis. Finally, the participants work for a variety of
companies (18 in total) including IBM, Mandiant, Cisco, TwinWave
Security, and one of the largest financial institutions.

by one tier build upon the IOCs required by the preceding
tiers.
4 MALWARE ANALYST TAXONOMY
We address our first research question by analyzing the objectives
of our participants. During our analysis, we observed that the high-
level objectives of the participants correlated with the IOCs that
the participants extract from the malware samples they analyze.
Given this observation, we defined a taxonomy that classifies mal-
ware analysts into three different groups based on their high-level
objectives.
4.1 Malware Analysts’ Objectives
We identified six main objectives that our participants discuss. Ad-
ditionally, we found that participants can have multiple objectives.
Each objective has corresponding IOCs required to achieve them.
The security community has defined six IOCs related to malware
analysis: hashes, IP addresses (IPs), domain names (DNs), network
and host artifacts (NHAs), tools (Ts), and techniques, tactics and
procedures (TTPs) [14]. In this subsection, we define each objective
our participants reported and identify the corresponding IOCs that
are required to achieve the objectives, as shown in Table 2.
Blacklist. Blocking IPs, DNs, and hashes, also known as blacklist-
ing, is the main objective of one of our participants. As P3 explains,
the “goal [of blacklisting] is to find out if the malware is causing
harm to the client and if it is, then block the file on their blacklists
and online through VirusTotal, push blacklists to endpoint devices.”
The IOCs necessary to achieve the blacklisting objective are hashes,
IPs, and DNs.
Extract Malicious Behavior. The most common objective par-
ticipants have is the extraction of potentially malicious behavior
from the malware sample. This objective involves capturing host
and network based activities and determining which might be part
of a malicious attack. As P10 explains, "part of my role on the team
that I’m on is to write behavioral indicators based on the sandbox
runs. So, I routinely review indicators from a report and see what
we could use to identify malware families or techniques that they
use.” The participants achieve this objective by monitoring host and
network activity such as process behavior and network communica-
tion. For example, P6 explains that his analysis is "typically always
host or network based. So does it create a mutex? Does it drop any
files? Does it modify any files? Does it modify the registry? and
what are the characteristics of the file itself? Take the hashes of the
file, what type of file it is and the network side would be: Does it
communicate with something? If so, what domain, URL, IP address,
what type of communication, protocol?"
Label Malware Families. Given that there are multiple versions
of malware samples that employ similar attack techniques, also
known as malware families, the objective of some participants is
to group malware into families to avoid analyzing known mal-
ware samples in depth. P1 spends "a lot of time looking at malware
and clustering malware based on their network communication
similarities. I developed some technologies that use the network
communication (http) to detect malware based on how they are
communicating over that protocol.” Similar to analysts that iden-
tify potentially malicious behavior, these analysts extract NHAs
to group malware. Additionally, P20 analyzes the tools used by
attackers to help exploit their targets. As P20 says, "I then look at
the behavior of many of those families, looking at the windows
API injections and code similarity, mostly working on doing the
aggregations for that.”
Generate Report. Oftentimes malware analysts provide reports
to their customers or threat intelligence teams with information
about the capabilities of a malware attack. P4 provided a brief
description saying, "My job is using static and dynamic analysis
to analyze the samples and write reports that vary in complexity.
Sometimes we do a basic triage of samples and sometimes we do
a full exhaustive analysis of samples to send to clients.” Similar
to the range of information included in the reports these analysts
produce, their work requires extracting different IOCs. This can
include hashes and IPs as well as analyzing the tools to obtain the
capabilities of a sample. When looking at a sample, P12 will "run
some tools that pull out metadata and analyze the PE files into the
headers, identify if it’s a DLL vs. an EXE, is it exporting anything?,
does it have any resource that is potentially used to unpack a file?”
Track Tactics, Techniques and Procedures. Another common
objective among our participants is to track the indicators of com-
promise known as TTPs. MITRE defines a set of tactics that cyber
attacks have used during attack campaigns and a set of techniques
that achieve each tactic [11]. For example, P7 says, “I primarily
focus on C2 [Command and Control] protocols for malware. Data
structures and algorithms are what I gravitated towards when I
first got into malware research. [...] I use those skill sets to group
malware families and do more long-term research on the families
like Trickbot and Emotet. I use those static skills from looking at
their configurations, how they operate, and their C2 protocols to
track them over time and when they change.” The TTPs that the
Session 11C: Software Development and Analysis CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea3056analysts extract are often sent to other teams to achieve other ob-
jectives such as threat intelligence and incident response. As P12
explains, the team that receives the TTPs he extracts models them
and "starts tying the different techniques and building the bigger
picture and they might see that different activities are related or
from the same campaign and threat actor." Another use for tracking
TTPs is to generate proactive defense mechanisms. After repro-
ducing some of the techniques that the malware performs in an
isolated environment, P14 can also "actuate [his] test environment
in such a way where [he] can turn on certain defense mitigations
to see if the malware is still able to perform its intended action."
4.2 Malware Analyst Tiers
After analyzing the participants’ objectives, we observed that partic-
ipants might extract the same set of IOCs when achieving different
objectives. As seen in Table 2, participants who extract malicious be-
havior, label malware families, or generate reports require network
and host artifacts. Similarly, the IOC tactics, techniques and proce-
dures is only extracted by participants whose objective is to track
TTPs. We used these observations to define a tiered taxonomy that
classifies the participants based on the IOCs they extract. Below,
we define each tier by the analysts’ main objective and required
IOCs.
Tier 1 (String-Based IOCs Extraction (SB)). SB analysts ex-
tract easily obtained string-based IOCs such as hashes, domain names,
and IP addresses from malware samples to detect when previously
seen malware samples re-appear in a large-scale analysis pipeline.
Tier 2 (Potentially Malicious Activity Identification (PMA)).
PMA analysts focus on identifying potentially malicious activities
exhibited by malware samples using network and host artifacts and
tools. This analysis process can be leveraged to design methods of mal-
ware detection that are more robust than easily modified IOCs, detect
different malware samples that exhibit similar activity, or identify
the capabilities of malware.
Tier 3 (Tactics, Techniqes, and Procedures Comprehen-
sion (TTP)). TTP analysts perform malware analysis to identify
the strategies and intentions behind threat actors’ attack campaigns,
which is accomplished by understanding the Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures that are used in different pieces of malware and correlating
these across multiple attacks.
After classifying our participants into these tiers, we have 1
participant in tier 1, 12 participants in tier 2, and 7 participants
in tier 3.4 An interesting finding is that we only classified one
participant in tier 1. This reinforces recent discussions within the
security community about how malware analysis is trending to-
wards behavior-based detection rather than string-based detection
because behavior-based methods can protect against undiscovered
malware samples and remain effective for longer periods of time [5].
5 MALWARE ANALYST WORKFLOWS
The main results of this study center around a detailed analysis of
participants’ workflows. In this section, we discuss the different

of his overall workflow, excluding the details needed to determine his tier.
Figure 1: Volume of malware samples analyzed per week
stages of a malware analyst’s process and highlight the most com-
mon workflows of the participants. Additionally, we elaborate on
how participants within the same tier have commonalities within
their workflows. The findings of this analysis answer the second
research question (RQ2).
We found that the workflow of a malware analyst consists of
three key steps: (1) obtaining malware samples, (2) prioritizing sam-
ples for analysis, and (3) in-depth malware analysis when indicated.
Next, we describe each of these steps and how they vary between
analysts we interviewed.
5.1 Obtaining Malware Samples
The first step in an analyst’s workflow is to find malware samples to
analyze. These samples can come from a variety of sources includ-
ing clients, open-source repositories, honeypots, security products,
and other internal analysis teams. The tier 1 participant reported
getting their samples from clients. The client pays for a service that
monitors their perimeter and detects malicious behavior, mainly
within the network traffic, emails and their attachments, and files
found on the company’s devices.
When samples require a more in-depth analysis, they will usually
be escalated to a tier 2 analyst. For example, P2 says "Any malware
samples that are too complicated to be solved with basic string anal-
ysis or requires unpacking usually ends up coming to my team."
There are also companies that provide incident response services
where clients hire them to investigate and remediate a cyber intru-
sion. As part of this process, incident responders search the client’s
enterprise for malware and send any samples they find to tier 2
analysts within the incident response company. Additionally, 7 of
the tier 2 participants supplement their samples from clients with
additional malware found in repositories such as VirusTotal [2], Re-
versing Labs [15], Malware Bazaar [10], The Zoo [17], AnyRun [4],
Malshare [9], Hybrid Analysis [7], Malpedia [8], and Twitter [18].
One reason for this practice is that analysts want to have a broad
range of samples to analyze so that they can generate signatures
with a wider coverage.

that requires an in-depth analysis in order to develop preventive
measures to protect against these samples. To be truly preventive,
these analysts are not able to rely on samples sent from clients
because these samples likely come from infections that have already
occurred. To obtain interesting samples, 5 participants in tier 3
scrape websites like Pastebins and disposable emails, and look in
repositories, similar to the ones mentioned in tier 2.
Although the patterns above are fairly consistent among our
participants, we found that the data source is also dependent on
the company the analysts work with. As P2 noted, "I have worked
in some roles where you don’t research very much malware and
others where I can research millions of files in a day. So, what I’ve
come to realize is that process is very much indicative of the in-
dividual company and the process they have developed." Finally,
in Figure 1, we specify the amount of malware samples that the
participants analyze per week. As seen in the figure, the majority of
the participants analyze anywhere between 5 and 20 malware sam-
ples. Just as the data source depends on the company, the amount
of malware samples also varies due to the current threat landscape.
5.2 Prioritization
The volume of malware samples has grown exponentially, making it
challenging for malware analysts to process all of the samples they
see. As a result, analysts must prioritize which samples to analyze.
A common method of prioritization used by our participants is
to assign a lower priority to samples that are variants of known
malware samples. To determine whether a sample is a variant of a
known malware family, analysts use static and dynamic methods to
scan samples for known IOCs. In static analysis, automated systems
generate hashes, and extract strings, including IPs, and domain
names. These string-based IOCs can then be cross-referenced with
blacklists to identify variants. In dynamic analysis, participants run
