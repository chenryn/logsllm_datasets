The code
    fn main() {}
    // ...
    // lots of code
    // ...
    fn some_random_function() {
        // lots of code here
        let unused = vec![];
        // even more code
    }
gives an error message which does not even hint about the error's location:
    :5:9: 5:22 error: unable to infer enough type information about `_`; type annotations required
    :5         xs.into_vec()
                           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
    :1:1: 8:2 note: in expansion of vec!
    :4:5: 4:12 note: expansion site
Which makes finding the offending statement require quite a bit of effort.
