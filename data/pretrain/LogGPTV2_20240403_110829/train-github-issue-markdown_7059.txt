The following Rust code:

```rust
fn main() {
    // ...
    // lots of code
    // ...
}

fn some_random_function() {
    // lots of code here
    let unused = vec![];
    // even more code
}
```

produces an error message that does not clearly indicate the location of the issue:

```
:5:9: 5:22 error: unable to infer enough type information about `_`; type annotations required
:5         xs.into_vec()
                           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
:1:1: 8:2 note: in expansion of vec!
:4:5: 4:12 note: expansion site
```

This vague error message makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact line and statement causing the problem, requiring significant effort to identify and resolve the issue. 

To improve clarity, the error message should ideally provide more context or a more specific location, such as the file name and line number where the error occurs. For example:

```
error[E0282]: unable to infer enough type information about `_`; type annotations required
 --> src/main.rs:5:9
  |
5 |         xs.into_vec()
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot infer type for `_`
  |
  = note: type must be known at this point
  = help: consider adding a type annotation
```

This would make it much easier to locate and fix the error.
