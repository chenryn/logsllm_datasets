### Experimental Setup and Observations

The parameters used in the experiments are listed in Table 1. Figure 9 shows the magnitude spectrum of the inverted sampled traffic \( \frac{dp(k)}{p} \), obtained for several values of \( p \), using 10,000 packets from the aggregate trace. By comparing the plot for \( p = 1 \) with those for other values, the following observations can be made:

1. **Low Frequency Recovery**: Only low frequencies of the original traffic can be recovered, even with a high sampling probability like \( p = 0.1 \).
2. **Harmonic Translation**: The harmonic tones of the original traffic, observed at \( p = 1 \), appear translated in the frequency spectrum of the sampled traffic signals, as expected by the Poisson summation formula.
3. **Noise Growth**: The noise across the continuous component of the traffic signal grows with \( \frac{1}{p} \), consistent with inequality (15).

### Effectiveness of the Filter-Bank

To evaluate the effectiveness of the filter-bank proposed in Section 5, we processed the packet trace with \( p \) values in the range \([10^{-4}, 1]\). This range was divided into 3 octaves per decade, resulting in \( L = 16 \) possible values for \( p \). We also considered \( W = 11 \) low-pass filters, whose bandwidths, according to (16), allow the bin size \( T \) to range over \([1 \, \text{s}, 400 \, \text{s}]\).

For each filter \( B_j \) and sampling rate \( p_i \), the algorithm compares the ratios \( \frac{\text{Var}(p_{i-1}, B_j)}{\text{Var}(p_i, B_j)} \) with respect to a threshold \( \theta_0 = 1 + \theta \). The number of consecutive sampling rates tested, \( N \), is used to decide the appropriateness of \( B_j \) and \( p_i \). The value of \( p = p_i \) is admissible for the bandwidth \( B_j \) if all considered ratios are smaller than \( \theta_0 \). To improve accuracy, we require that the ratio between \( \text{Var}(p_i, B_j) \) and the square of the estimated traffic volume is smaller than \( \theta \) (small relative error).

In our experiments, \( N \) was set to 2 or 3, and \( \theta \) varied in the range \([0.1, 0.2]\). For each bandwidth \( B_j \), we recorded the smallest admissible value of \( p \) and the absolute relative estimation error of the traffic volume calculated over time windows of \( T \) seconds.

### Results and Analysis

Figure 10 shows the maximum (solid lines) and average (dashed lines) values of the minimum allowed packet sampling probability and the absolute relative error for each considered value of \( T \). It is clear that, regardless of \( N \) and \( \theta \), our algorithm provides admissible packet sampling rates that ensure negligible average estimation errors for each bandwidth \( B_j \). The required sampling rate increases as the traffic is monitored over smaller intervals. For example, packet sampling rates smaller than 0.05 are only admissible for bin sizes \( T \) not smaller than 100 seconds. As expected, the algorithm becomes more conservative, providing smaller values of packet sampling probability, as \( N \) increases and \( \theta \) decreases.

### Conclusions and Future Research

This paper proposes a novel technique to model the impact of noise caused by packet sampling, using a theoretical analysis in the frequency domain. A real-time algorithm is presented to detect the spectrum portion of the network traffic signal that can be restored after packet sampling. Preliminary experimental results validate the proposed approach. Future research will focus on extending this approach to larger contexts such as network-wide monitoring, application-level analysis, and anomaly detection.
