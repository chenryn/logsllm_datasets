User: How to realize automatic deployment on Linux system? Please provide at least two common automated deployment tools.
Assistant: 1. Ansible Ansible is an automated deployment tool based on the SSH protocol. It uses the Python-based DSL language YAML to define tasks, which has good readability and maintainability. By writing Playbook on the Ansible control machine, the installation, configuration and startup of the target host software can be quickly realized. 2. Jenkins Jenkins is a web-based open source automated deployment tool for automated building, testing, and deploying software. Jenkins supports various programming languages and version control systems, can perform pipeline execution of different construction, testing and deployment tasks, and can alert, monitor and record all problems in the construction process. Jenkins can also be used in conjunction with other common automated deployment tools (such as Ansible) to achieve a more flexible automated deployment process.
