Carmichael
Monkey Paw, a taut string 
attached to a bent metal rod. 
This rod was jammed into the 
machine via the air vent and 
was used to fish around for the 
switch that released the coin 
hopper. Once the switch was 
activated, money was 
released!
This contraption took advantage of the fact that new 
machines used optical sensors to detect the number of 
coins dispensed. By blinding the optical sensor, the Light 
Wand made it impossible for the machine to know how 
much money it was releasing. Therefore, a player equipped 
with a Light Wand only had to play until a small jackpot was 
hit; it was then a matter of inserting the wand and turning a 
small payout into a mountain of money.

1980 Pennsylvania Lottery scandal
April 24th 1980 the lottery reaches its liability limits 
on the Daily Number (3-digit game) on 8 of the 
possible combinations of 6s and 4s (444, 446, 
464, 644, 646, 664, 666)
Winning number was 666.
Later in the evening rumors surfacing that illegal 
bookmakers were not paying.
When watched in slow motion only the 4s and 6s 
ever move more than a few inches from the 
bottom, as the rest of the balls had been weighted.

Ron Harris attacks against slots and 
keno
Ronald Dale Harris is a computer programmer who worked for the 
Nevada Gaming Control Board in the early 1990s and was responsible for 
finding flaws and gaffes in software that runs computerized casino games. 
Harris took advantage of his expertise, reputation and access to source 
code to illegally modify certain slot machines to pay out large sums of 
money when a specific sequence and number of coins were inserted

Ron Harris attacks against slots and 
keno (Cont.)
Harris surreptitiously coded a hidden software switch -- tripped by 
inserting coins in a predetermined sequence -- that would trigger cash 
jackpots. After retooling more than 30 machines, Harris and 
accomplices made the rounds, walking away with hundreds of 
thousands of dollars.

Ron Harris attacks against slots and 
keno (Cont.)
Harris shifted his focus to the probability game 
Keno, for which he developed a program that 
would determine which numbers the game's 
pseudorandom number generator would 
select beforehand. When Harris' accomplice, 
Reid Errol McNeal, attempted to redeem a 
high value winning keno ticket at Bally's 
Atlantic City Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New 
Jersey, casino executives became suspicious 
of him and notified New Jersey gaming 
investigators.  The investigation led authorities 
to Harris and after a trial was sentenced to 
seven years in prison.  He was released from 
prison after serving two years and currently 
resides in Las Vegas.

Tipton Overview
Lottery Fraud Case Involving a $14.3 million prize!
Lottery ticket purchased 
at a QuikTrip near 
Interstate Highway 80 on 
Dec. 23, 2010.
Prize went unclaimed for almost a year, 
until Hexham Investments Trust, a 
mysterious company incorporated in 
Belize, tried to claim the prize through 
Crawford Shaw, a New York attorney, 
hours before the ticket was set to expire in 
2011.

Tipton Overview (Cont.)
Lottery officials refused to release the prize because 
those behind the trust declined to give their identities, 
which is required under Iowa law. 
Claim to prize was withdrawn in January 2012. At that 
time, Iowa Lottery officials asked the Iowa Attorney 
General's Office and Iowa DCI to investigate.
On Oct. 13, authorities received a tip from an out-of-
state employee of the Multi-State Lottery Association 
that Tipton was the man in the video.
Investigators analyzed Tipton's cellphone records, 
which indicated he was in Des Moines when the ticket 
was purchased, according to the arrest report. They 
also discovered Tipton rented a silver 2007 Ford Edge 
on Dec. 22, which matched the vehicle of the buyer of 
the winning lottery ticket

Tipton Overview (Cont.)
Eddie was convicted in 2015 of two counts of fraud following a weeklong 
trial. One of the fraud charges accused Tipton of tampering with the 
nonprofit's computers to rig the draw, while the second accused him of 
participating in the ill-fated attempt to redeem the ticket in late 2011 that 
sparked an investigation.
He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but has been out on bond pending 
appeal.
June 29, 2016 Tipton pleaded guilty to three felony charges in Iowa and 
Wisconsin.  The other states where fraud occurred have agreed not to 
prosecute.
