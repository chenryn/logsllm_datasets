User: How to prevent DDoS attacks? Please list some solutions and technologies for defending against DDoS.
Assistant: 1. Increase server resources Increase server bandwidth and processor capacity to cope with sudden large traffic and loud noise attacks. 2. CDN distribution adopts CDN distribution technology to distribute data to multiple nodes, so that even if attacked, all nodes will not be affected. 3. Traffic cleaning Carry out traffic cleaning at the front end of the server, cloud platform, ISP gateway, etc., filter them, and block malicious traffic, thereby effectively weakening the attack. 4. Routing filtering Block access and requests from blacklisted IPs through routing filtering, thereby avoiding the implementation of hacker strategies. 5. Caching gateway Caching gateway technology is used to quickly back up patient data and page content, and alleviate response delay and paralysis caused by DDoS attacks. 6. Load balancing Use a load balancer to distribute traffic to multiple servers, and at the same time, servers can be balanced to improve business continuity and stability. 7. Cloud computing Using cloud computing technology, data and applications can be distributed to multiple nodes, and at the same time, automatic scaling and resource addition can be performed, thereby avoiding the impact of DDoS attacks. 8. Host defense By using the host defense system, applications can be inspected and defended, while filtering and blocking unnecessary traffic. 9. Intrusion detection Through intrusion detection technology, DDoS attacks can be discovered and prevented in time, such as intrusion prevention gateways. 10. Key management Correctly manage keys, strengthen the activities of VPN and TLS protocols, ensure encryption and security during the connection process, and reduce the risk of being attacked.
