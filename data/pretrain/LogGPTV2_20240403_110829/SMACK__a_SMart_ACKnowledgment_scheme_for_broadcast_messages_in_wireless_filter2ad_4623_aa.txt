ABSTRACT
Network protocol designers, both at the physical and network level,
have long considered interference and simultaneous transmission
in wireless protocols as a problem to be avoided. This, coupled
with a tendency to emulate wired network protocols in the wireless
domain, has led to artiﬁcial limitations in wireless networks.
In this paper, we argue that wireless protocols can exploit si-
multaneous transmission to reduce the cost of reliable multicast
by orders of magnitude. With an appropriate application inter-
face, simultaneous transmission can also greatly speed up common
group communication primitives, such as anycast, broadcast, leader
election and others.
The proposed method precisely ﬁts into the domain of directly
reachable nodes where many group communication mechanisms
are commonly used in routing protocols and other physical-layer
mechanisms. We demonstrate how simultaneous transmission can
be used to implement a reliable broadcast for an infrastructure
and peer-to-peer network using a prototype reconﬁgurable hard-
ware. We also validate the notion of using simple spectrum sensing
techniques to distinguish multiple transmissions. We then describe
how the mechanism can be extended to solve group communication
problems and the challenges inherent to build innovative protocols
which are faster and reliable at the same time.

INTRODUCTION
Noise and interference are fundamental aspects of communica-
tions, and are exceptionally important for wireless communications
because it’s more difﬁcult to contain propagation without waveg-
uides such as wires and ﬁbers. Avoiding interference or noise is a
fundamental design objective that limits the scope of simultaneous
multi-user communication. Conventional single carrier communi-
cation focuses on decoding the strongest signal while discarding
anything else as noise or interference.
Multi-user communication requires some form of orthogonal
channel for modulation that allows multiple parties to communi-
cate simultaneously. There are a number of ways to implement
orthogonal channels - code division multiple-access (CDMA) has
been adopted as a very reliable multiple access techniques by us-
ing specially designed codes with strong auto-correlation proper-
ties. With spatial frequency reuse, frequencies are allocated in a
way such that signals from far away communicating pairs will be
so strongly attenuated that they won’t interfere in local communi-
cation. Time division multiplexing, or taking turns using a channel,
is another method.
In this paper, we focus on using orthogonal frequency division
modulation (OFDM) to provide distinct orthogonal signals. OFDM
is a mechanism that splits the available spectrum into a number of
orthogonal non-interfering subchannels. Being orthogonal, each of
the subcarriers can be treated as an information carrying medium
without signiﬁcant interference with another subcarrier. Variants of
the OFDM waveform are used in a number of current wireless (and
wired) physical layers, including the 802.11a/g. Under OFDM,
different nodes can also communicate on different subcarriers, as
used in WiMax, which employs “scalable OFDMA” where users
use different subcarriers or set of subcarriers to transmit data over
the same medium and at the same carrier frequency.
The ability to distinguish multiple simultaneous transmissions
requires either the signal structure to be fairly simple or the de-
coding/detection mechanism to be complex. In this paper we fo-
cus on a set of network primitives that calls for a very simple an-
swer typically in binary; in the form of yes or no. Empowered
by subcarrier transmission using OFDM we can either transmit a
1 or a 0 to convey these binary answers. Not only is this form
of signaling simple, the detection of such a multiuser communica-
tion can be accomplished using spectrum sensing and energy detec-
tion. Simultaneous transmissions can be an advantage in a number
of network applications that call for multiple nodes to participate
and also use simple information. Examples include route requests,
leader election, network management and other operations involv-
ing broadcast or multicast messages. Not only does simultaneous
15transmission make the message exchange faster, it also allows such
exchanges to be reliable.
To demonstrate that the complexity in implementing this form
of multiuser communication is indeed tractable, we implemented
the protocol in a prototype hardware platform. Using FPGA based
Software Deﬁned Radios (SDR) we demonstrate the ability to de-
tect multiple tone transmissions using Fourier transform and energy
detection. The contributions of this paper are:
• We describe the practical constraints on using simultaneous
communication for a wireless mesh network.
• We describe how simultaneous reception can be used to
greatly improve protocol performance.
• We demonstrate the practicality of the system using a Soft-
ware Deﬁned Radio implementation of our protocol.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section §2 provides
some background theory on OFDM signal structure and its relation
to Fourier transform. Section §3 explains the protocol functionality
and its efﬁciency. Section §4 describes the robustness of the pro-
tocol. In section §5 we present the challenges and issues involved
in implementing the protocol using SDRs. This is followed by the
actual hardware implementation and design aspects in section §6.
To evaluate the hardware and the protocol performance we present
a set of experiments in section §7. The results from the experi-
ments have been analyzed in §8. To demonstrate the usefulness of
this physical layer protocol to higher layer protocols we present a
few applications in §10. Prior work related to this paper has been
investigated in section §11. Finally we conclude the paper in §12.
2. OFDM AND FOURIER TRANSFORM
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) [6] is a
special type of Multicarrier Modulation (MCM), where the data
stream is divided into several bit streams and the modulated sub-
carriers are spaced closely, although overlapping in such a manner
that they do not interfere with each other. Using the Fourier Trans-
form and its inverse, the signal is efﬁciently converted from the
time domain to the frequency domain and vice versa. Even though
the technology is prevalent for approximately 20 years, and stan-
dards like 802.11a/g and 802.16 have embraced OFDM/OFDMA
modulation techniques, we have not found any intelligent use of
the technology other than simply using it as a medium of transmis-
sion at higher data rates.
The fact that the component sinusoids of an OFDM signal can be
easily aggregated to form time domain signals as in eq. 1 empowers
us to use any part of the spectrum by suitably selecting the spectral
coefﬁcients x(k).

Here, X(n) is the value of the signal at time n which is composed
of frequencies denoted by 2πkn/N, k is the index of frequency
over N spectral components that divides the available bandwidth
with equal spacing and x(k) gives the value of the spectrum at kth
frequency.
This leads to the notion of non-contiguous OFDM (NC-OFDM)
which can degenerate to even a single frequency or tone. A Fourier
transform of such an NC-OFDM signal reveals the spectral energy
and can be detected using fairly simple methods.
The simplicity of OFDM and ease of implementation of such a
system has led us to innovate the newer protocols and signaling
methods described in the this paper.
3. SMART ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
In this paper, we focus on speeding group communication using
simultaneous transmission and reception. There are many types
of group communications, the most common of which is broadcast
or multicast. Conventional infrastructure wireless networks (e.g., a
standard WiFi network) usually only use broadcast packets to trans-
late wired broadcasts into wireless packets. The standard 802.11
physical layer doesn’t provide a method for determining if a broad-
cast was delivered; thus such broadcasts are typically transmitted
at the lowest modulation rate (in an effort to increase the reliabil-
ity of reception). Since broadcast messages are exchanged without
acknowledgment control frames, there is a limited scope for the
source or the access point (AP) to reliably ensure the reception of
the message at the host nodes.
In “ad hoc” networks, broadcast messages are used for many pur-
poses. Typical applications include host discovery, network main-
tenance, route discovery, etc. For example, wireless protocols such
as AODV [18] periodically broadcast a routing table to “neigh-
boring nodes” (meaning those that can hear the message). Nodes
also periodically transmit “hello” messages to determine if nodes
are still reachable. These messages are typically “unicast” mes-
sages, because there is no way to safely determine if they’ve been
received.
Reliable broadcast messages, “hello” link maintenance messages
and many other communications share a common pattern: a mes-
sage is sent and one or more nodes should “vote” on the trans-
mitted message. For reliable broadcasts, the vote is an acknowl-
edgment that “I have received and can decode the message”.
If
a node has not received the message, the sender would retransmit
it. Link maintenance messages are almost identical, except that
if a formerly “adjacent” node does not receive the message, it is
removed from the node neighbors table (with no retransmission).
Many other protocols, such as voting protocols, can map to a simi-
lar query followed by a yes/no decision from other nodes.
Some of these protocols concerning a single network “link” have
an analogous extension to a “network” counterpart. For exam-
ple, there is considerable work on providing reliable network-wide
support for broadcast packets in wireless networks, as well as dis-
tributed leader election.
3.1 SMACK - Reliable Link Layer Broad-
casts
For any reliable broadcast mechanism to be reliable, there must
be a clearly deﬁned set of nodes in the network; Figure 1(a) shows
a single access point and multiple clients. Each client is assigned
a unique “membership number”. For our implementation we have
chosen the OFDM based physical layer for 802.11a/g as the under-
lying signaling method. Figure 1(b) shows a schematic illustration
of the properties of the OFDM waveform that are needed. A given
bandwidth, such as the 2.4Ghz band used by 802.11g, is subdivided
into a number of subcarriers around a center frequency; that center
frequency is the “channel” to which an 802.11 radio is set.
In 802.11g, 53 subcarriers remain for data modulation. Nor-
mally, a single transmitter modulates all subcarriers to send high
bandwidth data. In our protocol, since we only need to transmit
a “yes” or “no”, we assign subcarriers to individual nodes, as il-
lustrated in Figure 1(b); different clients are assigned subcarrier
bins labeled as fc1, fc2, . . . , fcn where n depends on the number
of users and the number of subcarriers available. The orthogonality
of individual subcarriers allows us to use each of them as sepa-
rate data carriers for different hosts. Using multicarrier modulation
techniques allows the AP to receive ACKs from a greater num-
ber of clients in the shortest possible time, dramatically reducing
16802.11g PHY that is the basis for our extension. A normal mes-
sage requires a 20μs preamble to be transmitted and then, at best
assuming the 54M bps modulation rate, each 48 × 6 bits takes one
OFDM symbol time (4μs) to transmit. Thus, a 64 byte message,
which can’t actually even contain the Ethernet addresses in a stan-
dard 802.11g packet would take at least 20 + 4× 3 or 32μseconds.
After a 16μs “SIFS” period for a 20M Hz channel [13], clients
would normally respond using a similar message format. Thus, a
single response to a standard 802.11g packet would take another
≈ (32 + 16) = 48μs.
By comparison, using physical layer signaling 53 clients can pro-
vide a single bit of information within two OFDM symbol periods,
or a total of 8μs (as detailed in §5.2), or one-sixth the time for a
single station to respond using standard messages. This means that
using the proposed protocol, the time needed for a single station
will be reduced by about an order of magnitude; when the num-
ber of potential respondents increases, that time is reduced by two
orders of magnitude.
3.2 Extending Link Layer Broadcasts
As Figure 1(a) makes clear, we have mainly worried about pro-
viding a reliable broadcast for a “single hop” wireless network.
We’d still like to have reliable broadcasts in multi-hop wireless net-
works. Such protocols usually use link layer ﬂooding which often
requires re-broadcast and leads to a common phenomenon called a
broadcast storm [16]. This problem is especially elevated by the
lack of ACKs – without an acknowledgment, it’s unclear which
nodes have received messages. ACK-based broadcast schemes that
degenerate the broadcast mechanism into multiple unicast commu-
nication increases network overhead and latency. Given a reliable
ACK as a basic operation, we can obviously improve on scalable
broadcast algorithms [25, 22]. More importantly, we can use the
time of arrival information available at the physical layer to further
improve the performance of reliable network broadcasts. We show
how to do this in §10.
