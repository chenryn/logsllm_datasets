### Password Cracking Using PCFG

#### Introduction
This section discusses the effectiveness of Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) in password cracking, particularly focusing on Chinese and English datasets. The analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the PCFG algorithm and presents an improved version.

#### Datasets and Training
- **Training Set**: 1 million Rockyou passwords.
- **Chinese Datasets**:
  - Tianya
  - Dodonew
  - 178
  - CSDN
  - 7k7k
  - Duowan_rest
- **English Datasets**:
  - Not explicitly listed, but mentioned as three datasets.

#### Search Space Size
- **Figure 4a**: PCFG-based attacks on six Chinese datasets.
- **Figure 4b**: PCFG-based attacks on three English datasets.
- **Figure 4c**: Improved PCFG-based attacks on Chinese datasets.

The figures illustrate the search space size for different groups of datasets, showing that the improved algorithm gains tangible advantages.

#### Observations
- **Convergence and Randomness**:
  - Letters in passwords tend to be more converging (see Table 3).
  - Digits in general are more random and diverging than letters.

#### Weakness in PCFG
- **Monotonically Long Base Structure**:
  - The original PCFG algorithm [36, 58] inherently gives extremely low probabilities to password guesses with a monotonically long base structure (e.g., "D1L1D1L1D1L1D1L1" or "(D1L1)4").
  - For example, the probability \( P("1q2w3e4r") \) is calculated as:
    \[
    P((D1L1)4) \cdot P(D1 \rightarrow 1) \cdot P(L1 \rightarrow q) \cdot P(D1 \rightarrow 2) \cdot P(L1 \rightarrow w) \cdot P(D1 \rightarrow 3) \cdot P(L1 \rightarrow e) \cdot P(D1 \rightarrow 4) \cdot P(L1 \rightarrow r)
    \]
  - This probability can hardly be larger than \( 10^{-9} \), as it is a multiplication of nine individual probabilities.
  - As a result, some guesses (e.g., "1q2w3e4r" and "a12b34c56") will never appear in the top-10^7 guesses.

#### Conclusion
The improved PCFG algorithm addresses the limitations of the original method by providing better handling of monotonically long base structures, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of password cracking on both Chinese and English datasets.
