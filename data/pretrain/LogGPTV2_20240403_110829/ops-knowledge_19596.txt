User: I think my question is already clear enough, but to make it even more clear i will illustrate it with my example.
I'm currently returning many json every request, which I would like to cache in some way. I thought memcache would be great, but I only see that they use memcache for caching queries.
Assistant: JSON is just text, so yes, you can store it in memcache.
