distributed across the table, which can alleviate the short attack
distance limitation on MDF tables.
Compact and Portable Attack System. In the demon-
stration of SurﬁngAttack, we use a waveform generator for
signal generation, and the voice commands are uploaded to
the memory before every experiment. To build a compact and
portable attack system, we could use mobile devices to produce
modulated attack signals. Although most mobile devices can
only transmit a modulated narrow-band signal with the carrier
frequency of at most 24 kHz due to their sampling rate limit of
48 kHz, Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S7 support
96 kHz sampling rate, which can be used to generate attack
signals. A portable attack system using these mobile devices
as shown in Fig. 7 will be developed in future work.

against smartphones by applying intentional electromagnetic
interference on headphone cables to emit a carefully designed
inaudible AM-modulated signal. Our work can be considered
as one special type of hardware level attack.
Sonic or Ultrasonic-based Attacks. Recently, researchers
have proposed sonic or ultrasonic wave based attacks. Bolton
et al. [6] show that the crafted ultrasonic tones could corrupt
the hard drives and operating systems, causing spontaneously
reboot. Trippel et al. [47] gain control of the outputs of
MEMS accelerometers by leveraging the circuit imperfections
with resonant acoustic injections. A number of recent research
studies have focused on attacking the voice controlled system
using ultrasonic wave [41], [42], [44], [52]. These attacks
employ the ultrasound in air for delivering voice commands.
However, due to the directivity of ultrasound and unmaskable
size of the ultrasound speaker, the attack device can be easily
exposed. In contrast, we show that
is possible to use
ultrasonic guided waves to inject inaudible commands through
solid materials with a hidden attack device, causing a wide
variety of more serious security and privacy issues.
it
Guided Wave Technology. Recently, Roy et al. [40]
propose Ripple II, which is a surface communication scheme
through vibration. Ripple II excites acoustic vibrations to
microphone for linear response, while SurﬁngAttack excites
ultrasonic guided waves to microphone for nonlinear response.
The sources (vibration motor versus ultrasound sensor), the
principles of acoustic responses, and the purpose are different,
which lead to completely different signal designs. Moreover,
similar physical vibrations on a solid surface have been used
for user authentication [31], as well as touch location and
object identiﬁcation [30]. These physical vibrations induced
by vibration motors have different characteristics, compared
with the insensible ultra-minor vibration of ultrasonic guided
waves used in this paper.
Ultrasonic guided waves have been proven useful for both
[39] for materials and Struc-
Nondestructive Testing (NDT)
tural Health Monitoring (SHM) [46] for structures. Guided
wave testing (GWT) employs acoustic waves that propagate
along an elongated structure while guided by its bound-
aries [39]. This allows the waves to travel a long distance
with minor energy losses. GWT is widely used to inspect
and screen engineering structures [35], particularly for the
inspection of metallic pipelines around the world [4]. There
are also applications for inspecting rail tracks [11], rods [24],
and metal/composite plate structures [22], [32]. To the best
of our knowledge, this research is the ﬁrst to present a novel
attack towards voice assistants using guided wave technology.
X. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explore the feasibility of launching inaudi-
ble ultrasonic attack leveraging solid material as a transmission
medium. Compare to the previous studies on over-the-air
transmission, our proposed attack SurﬁngAttack can conceal
itself within/beneath the materials, offering new avenues to
launch inaudible attack in a previously unavailable setting.
Leveraging the energy delivery form of ultrasonic guided wave,
SurﬁngAttack proves to be an effective and economic attack,
successfully attacking devices across a long distance through a
17
30ft long table with only 0.75W attack signal power. Extensive
experiments were conducted to explore the extent of this
newly discovered threat as well as its limitation. Furthermore,
recognizing that voice controllable devices are designed to
enable conversations between human and computer, we further
extend our attack to listen to the voice responses with minimal
volume, enabling conversations between the adversary and the
voice controllable device. Using SurﬁngAttack, we demon-
strated potential attacks that will allow an adversary to hack
the SMS passcode or make a fraud phone call. We also provide
discussions and several defenses to mitigate SurﬁngAttack.
