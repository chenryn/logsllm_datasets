### Distributed Attack System

The distribution of the attack system across the table can help alleviate the short attack distance limitation associated with MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard) tables.

### Compact and Portable Attack System

In the demonstration of SurﬁngAttack, we used a waveform generator for signal generation, and the voice commands were uploaded to the memory before each experiment. To build a compact and portable attack system, mobile devices can be utilized to produce modulated attack signals. Although most mobile devices are limited to transmitting a modulated narrow-band signal with a carrier frequency of up to 24 kHz due to their sampling rate limit of 48 kHz, Samsung Galaxy S6 and S7 support a 96 kHz sampling rate, which is sufficient for generating attack signals. A portable attack system using these mobile devices, as shown in Fig. 7, will be developed in future work.

### Related Work

#### Electromagnetic Interference Attacks

Kasmi et al. [28] introduced a voice command injection attack against smartphones by applying intentional electromagnetic interference on headphone cables to emit a carefully designed inaudible AM-modulated signal. Our work can be considered a specific type of hardware-level attack.

#### Sonic or Ultrasonic-based Attacks

Recently, researchers have proposed sonic or ultrasonic wave-based attacks. Bolton et al. [6] demonstrated that crafted ultrasonic tones could corrupt hard drives and operating systems, causing spontaneous reboots. Trippel et al. [47] gained control of MEMS accelerometers by leveraging circuit imperfections with resonant acoustic injections. Several recent studies have focused on attacking voice-controlled systems using ultrasonic waves [41], [42], [44], [52]. These attacks employ ultrasound in air to deliver voice commands. However, due to the directivity of ultrasound and the unmaskable size of the ultrasound speaker, the attack device can be easily exposed. In contrast, our research shows that it is possible to use ultrasonic guided waves to inject inaudible commands through solid materials with a hidden attack device, leading to a wide variety of more serious security and privacy issues.

#### Guided Wave Technology

Roy et al. [40] proposed Ripple II, a surface communication scheme that uses vibration. Ripple II excites acoustic vibrations for a linear response, while SurﬁngAttack excites ultrasonic guided waves for a nonlinear response. The sources (vibration motor vs. ultrasound sensor), the principles of acoustic responses, and the purposes are different, leading to distinct signal designs. Additionally, similar physical vibrations on solid surfaces have been used for user authentication [31] and touch location and object identification [30]. These physical vibrations induced by vibration motors have different characteristics compared to the insensible ultra-minor vibrations of ultrasonic guided waves used in this paper.

Ultrasonic guided waves have proven useful for both Nondestructive Testing (NDT) [39] and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) [46]. Guided wave testing (GWT) employs acoustic waves that propagate along an elongated structure, guided by its boundaries [39]. This allows the waves to travel long distances with minimal energy loss. GWT is widely used to inspect engineering structures [35], particularly metallic pipelines worldwide [4]. There are also applications for inspecting rail tracks [11], rods [24], and metal/composite plate structures [22], [32]. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to present a novel attack towards voice assistants using guided wave technology.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we explored the feasibility of launching inaudible ultrasonic attacks using solid materials as a transmission medium. Compared to previous studies on over-the-air transmission, our proposed attack, SurﬁngAttack, can conceal itself within or beneath materials, offering new avenues to launch inaudible attacks in previously unavailable settings. Leveraging the energy delivery form of ultrasonic guided waves, SurﬁngAttack proves to be an effective and economic attack, successfully targeting devices across a long distance through a 30-foot-long table with only 0.75W of attack signal power. Extensive experiments were conducted to explore the extent of this newly discovered threat and its limitations. Furthermore, recognizing that voice-controllable devices are designed to enable conversations between humans and computers, we extended our attack to listen to voice responses with minimal volume, enabling conversations between the adversary and the voice-controlled device. Using SurﬁngAttack, we demonstrated potential attacks that allow an adversary to hack SMS passcodes or make fraudulent phone calls. We also provided discussions and several defenses to mitigate SurﬁngAttack.
